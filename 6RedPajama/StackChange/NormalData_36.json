["Q: FaceTime calls wrong person Often (not always) I try to call my mother using FaceTime it calls totally the wrong person. The wrong person it calls, is always the same wrong person. How is this even possible?\n\nA: Open your Contacts and check all of the phone numbers and email addresses listed for the person that gets called (check your mother's contact as well).  This person's contact likely incorrectly contains your mother's phone number or email address.  Remove or correct the incorrect information from that person's contact information and the problem will go away.\n\nA: This has been happening in our family as well, but not sure if it's a bug in \"the system\" or an effect of misconfiguration somewhere (like contacts, old numbers, etc) locally. \nWhen my daughter uses my wife's phone to call my mother-in-law via FaceTime, often a stranger will answer (seems to always be the same person) and says to stop calling. But on the phone itself is shows my wife's mom's name listed, and when we try the call again it usually goes through as expected the second time. \nIt happened again this morning so I tried looking it up to see if others are experiencing this and found a bunch of threads where other's have experienced this bug as well.

To be honest, I'm not sure if it's laptop related, or somehow related to my router.\nThe issue is, when I am connected to my wireless network via 802.11ac, I can't see a shared drive that is connected to my router via ethernet. However, when connected via 802.11n, I can see it just fine.\nFor the sake of clarity, when I say \"see my shared drive\", I mean when I open Finder, I see the shared drive listed in the left hand menu under \"Shared\", I can navigate it's file system, etc.\nMy router is an Asus RT-AC68U, and the shared drive is a Bubba B3 (basically, a Debian based media server). This is frustrating, as I have to shut off 5 GHz on my router to do backups via Time Machine. Regardless of what protocol my MBP is using to connect, the laptop and the shared drive are on the same network, and in the same subnet. I can connect to the B3 via ssh, and I suppose I could just do a tar based, command line backup of my MBP and scp it over to the B3, but I'd really rather use Time Machine, as it does what it's supposed to do quite well.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: The Bubba B3 only supports 802.11 b/g/n networks by design.\nThat is why you do not see it on the 802.11ac network.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 status bar, what is this symbol?

I looked down at my dashboard and it said 9 users were on my FaceTime. I freaked and shut it down. Now is there anyway I can find out who was watching and how they turned it on?\n\nA: Facetime is a 1:1 system. So, you can only be connected to 1 person. It's more likely the app had gotten run as bassplayer7 suggested and the green light just indicated that your camera was in use by an application. The 9 may have referred to the number of people in your address book you can Facetime with or that there are 9 recents in the recents list.\n", "Q: Possible to update within iOS 6? If I purchase a brand new iPhone 5 and it has iOS 6.0, can I still upgrade to 6.1.4? I do NOT want iOS 7 or 8.\n\nA: If the phone is capable of running iOS 8, then there would be no chance to upgrade to any other older version. Updates must be validated (signed) by Apple at the time they are applied and Apple has stopped signing iOS 6 and iOS 7 updates for all but a very few devices which cannot run iOS 8. \n", "Q: Why does Google Drive create so many conflicted files?

I tried to follow the directions above, but when I click on \"Window\" there is no \"Show Adjustments Bar\" for me to click on, so I'm lost.  Or just having a senior moment?\nWhat I want to do is make all the still photos in a project the same length to start, then make adjustments.  I can't figure out how to do that.\nI can highlight all the stills, but nothing more than that.

The audio goes on and on but the picture is frozen. \nIf I try to adjust it back to the original length it was, it still stops dead on the photo.

I used to be able to disable it in iPhoto but now iPhoto is not part of the OS, I don't want to download iPhoto to just use it to disable itself and Image Capture. Any way to kill the auto pop out feature?\n\nOkay, got it finally.\n\n\nA: First you need to eject your SD card. And then you should plug it back in. Once you do that, the IC will pop up. There is a small icon looks like ejection on the lower left corner (poor design, Apple), click the icon and it will pop out a menu, where you can choose \"no application\" for your SD card.\nUnfortunately you have to do it with every single SD card of yours. Another poor design choice from Apple.\n\nA: As an addendum it seems to tag which cards to not auto launch for in files stored on the card itself, so formatting the card in the camera resets this, in effect meaning if you use a workflow where you format the card in the camera every time (which is a standard workflow) you will have to dismiss auto capture every time for the same cards.\n\nA: James, there is no eject button. You may be referring to an older version. The Image Capture with Yosemite seems to have no method to be disabled. \n\nA: James Wayne's answer works, but only covers the single device or memory card that you edited in Image Capture.\nTo affect all devices/cards, open Terminal.app (use Spotlight to find it) and type the following, pressing enter at the end:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture2 HotPlugActionPath ''\n\nThis works for me on 10.10.5.\n", "Q: How do I transfer my entire itunes library (retaining the original music playlists) from my iPad iOS 5.1 How do I transfer my entire itunes library (including the specific music playlists) from my original iPad iOS 5.1  via wifi to my new Macbook air with Yosemite?\nThe bulk of my music library is CD's that I have imported manually.\nI have authorized both computers in the iTunes account tab. \nI tried hooking my iPad, via it's USB cord, to the Macbook Air's USB port.  The iPad does pop up in iTunes, but I am not sure what to do next to permanently import all of the iPad's music, ibooks, movies etc. into the iTunes on my Macbook air. \n\nA: You don't move your Music from the iPad to the new computer, you copy your entire iTunes library from your old computer to your new computer and then re-sync your iPad to the new computer.\nHere are the Apple instructions:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4527\n\nA: I would suggest you try using the Home Sharing.\niTunes: Setting up Home Sharing on your computer\nHome Sharing in iTunes lets you share and transfer content between multiple iTunes libraries on your home network....read on here.\nand this article might be helpful.\nHow to move your iTunes library to a new computer \nHT4527\n\nA: If you dare to spend a small amount of money, try http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/.\nI am totally happy with that, I even can backup apps and their respective settings.\nAnd I use it to sync my playlists and library from home to work by \nI am really in love with that tool... :) \n", "Q: iPod Touch 5th gen not responding my iPod touch 5th gen will not respond. it is stuck in the FaceTime app frozen and i have my \"accessive touch\" on the screen and it just keeps flashing on and off. and neither of my buttons work. help me? thanks\n\nA: Hold down BOTH the home button and the sleep button until the device shuts off (can take several seconds).

The sort is the same whether it is set to \"Name\" or \"None\". Fixing the typos caused the order to behave as expected (2014s then 2015s).\nIs this some kind of feature designed to make files like version 9 come before files like version 10?\n\nA: It is sorting numerically. An eight digit number is always going to come before a nine digit number.   \nIt is a feature of Finder, so that Something10 shows up after Something9 and not before Something2, provided that all of the \"Something\" is always the same. \n", "Q: Finder does not sort correctly in mavericks I have both 'sort by' and 'arrange by' sorted as last opened and still finder is not showing the files and folders correctly. \ne.g., I have some documents made in 2014 but finder shows those documents as if they were made in 2013.

In my Apple Mail on MacBook Pro I have 4 Mailboxes. One of them is Gmail synced via IMAP.\nWhen I open the app everything works fine for about an hour, then an exclamation point next to my Gmail inbox appears saying \"Too many simultaneous connections\". This is nonsense because this is the only app accessing the e-mail. I know its creating more connections in background but...\nThe problem is that after this hour elapses, the whole Mail app is kind of frozen. Sending e-mails stops at 80% and won't finish (even all other mailboxes) and the app doesn't synchronize all the mailboxes at all. From time to time the whole app crashes completely.\nAny ideas what could be wrong and Where to look for more details about this? Anyone with similar problems? Thank you!\n\nA: check this link - gmail changed their authentication method without notice, so you have to make this change.  You will get a confirmation email from gmail that seems scary - but it isn't.  You haven't just opened your email to the world as they try to scare you to believe.

But the first thing I would try is to delete the account from Mail and then create it again. Since it's all IMAP anyway, you won't lose anything except the local copies. When it is recreated, it will have to download everything again but it should at least be a clean copy. If you are still having crashes after that... well, then it could be many many things.

I have done some research on the subject and it seems this is a common problem in Mac community unsolved for years. Apple reacted on this about a year ago with the message like \"Our team is working on it\". The Mail app is trying to parallelize syncing (I believe) and it causes more connections than allowed by Google.\nThe final solution that worked for me is to wipe out your Mail app completely via deleting all the application data and then set it up again from ground up. If you have IMAP accounts you wont lose any e-mail. Be sure to back up your e-mail signatures, filters and double check you have all the settings you need to set up all your e-mail accounts again.

For example, with iCloud sync it seems feasible to be able to access the data through a website (i've checked https://www.icloud.com/ but it's not visible).  I really like the Health app dashboard but I'd like it more if I could also see it from other devices :)\nIf there is no official way, does Apple allow accessing iCloud data through some web API?  I can build a proof-of-concept dashboard if they have some kind of web service.\nLastly, another method I've considered is building an app that (after requesting permissions) reads the data through HealthKit and then provides that to an external storage service.  I'd like to know if something like this exists (so I don't reinvent the wheel).\n\nI found another thread from June 2014 that indicates it's not possible to directly inspect iCloud backups, though I'm pretty sure they're only referring to viewing through iTunes or iCloud.com.\n\nA: Best way I found was to:\nOpen Health App and head to Health data < All and use the arrow on the upper right of the screen then choose Export.\nIt will take a while if you have a data. You'll be able to get a ZIP file that you can mail to yourself.\nJust use XCode and you should (at least!) be able to read your data. You could then use dropbox to sync it with your other devices. \n\n\n\nA: Doing an encrypted backup on iTunes (unencrypted backups don't include health datas) and using a backup reader app, like iBackupbot (http://download.cnet.com/iBackupBot/3000-18553_4-75532275.html), that will ask you your backup password, you can get on your computer the healthdata folder which contains all your Health datas!\n\n\nA: I created a webapp to convert the exported XML file from the Apple Health app to an easy to use comma-separated file. \n-> http://ericwolter.com/projects/health-export.html\n", "Q: Why does my magic mouse lose the connection when I lift and place down again on surface? I have a magic mouse with 100% battery level indicator and am recently finding (since I changed the batteries) that when I raise the mouse off the surface and move to get more room for a motion and when I place it back down, it now often loses the connection.\nIs there a loose connection in my mouse that is getting jostled when I place it back down again?\nIs there something wrong with the new batteries?\nPlease suggest how to get a reliable bluetooth connection to my MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite.\n\nA: It must be about the batteries but for what I've experienced so far it's not about energy, but about their length, at a very slight scale.\nSince two days I had this problem again - it occured like almost 10 times this morning. So I removed the battery cover, and put a flat piece of folded paper towel upon the batteries, in a way that when I put the cover back again, it is slightly bent, just what it needs to ensure a firm pressure on the batteries, so they won't move at all.\nMy conclusion is : problem solved.\ntl;dr : you can fix Apple's 80$ mouse with 2 sheets of toilet paper\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem with the magic mouse connection being lost when I lifted the mouse.\nI have now switched the batteries from my wife's magic mouse into my mouse and it works perfectly.\nWhen I switch my batteries back into my mouse the problem comes back. The batteries are the exact same type (Energizer Advanced) as the ones in my wife's mouse. \nAt this point I thought that the issue lay with my batteries, until I switched my batteries into my wife's mouse and the mouse worked perfectly. So my batteries cause the problem in my mouse but not my wife's mouse. \nSo all I can suggest is that you get another pair of batteries and hope they work.\n\nA: I had this same problem and I tried adding the paper shim without success. What is working for me right now is leaving the cover off completely.

As a developer, I will be running and testing the web apps that I am developing locally.   But Chrome and Safari are not allowing me to hit my local server with SSL enabled.\nhttps://localhost:8443/ is not working saying SSL error with the following error message.   I think,  it is something to do with adding my certificate to OS X Keychain Access,  but I couldn't figure what actually needs to be done!\nCould some one please help me out!\n\nSSL connection error Hide details Unable to make a secure connection\n  to the server. This may be a problem with the server, or it may be\n  requiring a client authentication certificate that you don't have.\n  Error code: ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR\n\nUpdate\nI was generating the self signed SSL keystore and certificate using the below command\nkeytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore /path/to/keystore -keysize 2048 -validity 365\n\nMy problem got resolved,  when I generated my self signed certificate with below simple command.  \nkeytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/keystore\n\nI am not sure why!?\n\nA: It's likely that the issue is with certificates for your server.  You probably don't have a SSL certificate for localhost:8443 (as it's unlikely that any CA is going to issue one for that hostname), so of course you're going to get certificate errors.  Either click through the certificate errors; or choose a valid domain that you control, get a certificate for it, and host your site on that domain.\nIf you have a certificate for your domain (example.com) and you have a SSL certificate for that domain (e.g., for www.example.com), another thing you could try is setting up DNS (or your /etc/hosts file) so that www.example.com resolves localhost (127.0.0.1).  This still might run into other issues, and really, it's better to just test it on the domain you have a certificate for or click through the certificate errors.\nNone of this is likely to be Mac OS X specific.\n\nA: Two things I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the service is listening on *:8443, then I would not call https://localhost:8443 but more https://MyMachineName:8443, because that enables me to\n\n*Use the company certificate and put a DNS alias in your /etc/hosts file, like\n192.168.24.3 www.mycompany.com\nBut it HAS TO BE the same name as in the certificate, the CN!\nBeware: Every time you enter now \"www.mycompany.com:8443\" or \"www.mycompany.com\" Safari/Chrome would now redirect you to your local instance. :) Don't be irritated and don't call your Helpdesk when your company site is not reachable due to your local webserver being stopped. :)\nHappy developping! :)\n\nA: If your local web server is still using SSLv3 then current versions of Chrome will no longer connect to it.  Chrome (and I believe Safari) have removed support for SSL3 fallback to mitigate the POODLE vulnerability.\nIf you believe that your server may be still using SSL3 the do a quick Google of \"POODLE SSLv3\" to get more information.\n\nA: For local testing you can use a Self-Signed certificate. Generate your own using openssl utility or you can use this site selfsignedcertificate.com\nYou may add the generated certificate as trusted certificate under your browser settings. \n\nA: Use your local network IP address.  You can find it by running ifconfig from a bash terminal.  It produces some output like:\neno1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet 192.16.0.123  netmask 255.255.255.0\n...\nlo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536\n        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0\n...\n\nIn the above, your IP address is 192.16.0.123.\nNow in the address bar of Safari, instead of:\nhttps://localhost:8443\n\nUse\nhttps://198.162.0.123:8443\n\nWorked for me on Browserstack.

Some background:\nI first got a Macbook Pro, 1, from my work. It was connected to the company AD. Since I had admin rights on this machine and didn't like having different AD policies forced upon me I reinstalled it to get a plain Mac OS X, free from any AD connections. 1 was then involved in an accident including water and broke. I then got a replacement Macbook, 2, which I reinstalled to get out of the AD like I did with 1. I then and transferred all data using Migration Assistant (the harddrive of 1 was not broken, however, the file system needed extensive repair).\nSo far, I didn't have any problems with my System Keychain. However, I then got rid of 2, after doing a Time Machine backup of it, and got a third Macbook, 3, which I wanted to do a clean install on.\nNow when I try to read some wifi-passwords stored in the System keychain for 1 and 2 (by browsing to it on 1's old hard drive/the Time Machine backup of 2) on 3 I get an error message that the password I enter is incorrect. I am as sure as you could possibly be that I know the password to the account I had on 1 and 2 (I use the same password on 3) but obviously this is not the correct password to unlock the System keychain.\nIf I open my user keychain from 2 (from the Time Machine backup) I can unlock it using the password I used on my account on 2 (and 1 and 3). However, if I open the user keychain from 1's old harddrive I can't unlock it using the account password I used on 1. 1's water accident led to a lot of write errors on the harddrive and a lot of orphaned files but since all 1's keychains have worked on 2 I don't think the keychain files were affected.\nSo my question is something like: how does the OS unlock the System keychain after I login using my account password? Where does the OS find the password for the System keychain? In my user keychain? Apparantly, using the Migrations Assistant, iunlocking System is a non issue, while when I copy the keychain files manually something that is required is not transfered.\nA final note: when I got 1 it probably came with some default password. It was 3 years ago so I don't remember. Can that be relevant here? Since I did a clean install (IIRC) I would be surprised but I guess there are different ways to reinstall a computer and I don't remember exactly how I did.\n\nA: The login (user account) password isn't stored in keychain access, but keychain access automatically adopts the user account password as the keychain access password by default.\nSo, your password for keychain access is most likely the same as the login password. \nThere is no default password in mac, the user creates one on install. If your mac was provided already installed, there was likely an assigned password created by the admin, perhaps associated with AD. If you reinstalled OSX, it would not have wiped the password, but if you formatted the harddrive, then reinstalled OSX, you would have created a new password.\n\nA: You can reset the keychain password as described here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203192\nFrom the knowledge base article:\n\n... if you don't know your keychain password, you might need to reset\n  your keychain.\nResetting a keychain sets aside the original default keychain file and\n  creates a new one.\nTo reset your keychain in Mac OS X 10.4, Mac OS X 10.5, and Mac OS X\n  10.6 Snow Leopard or later:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Keychain Access, which is in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.\n  \n*From the Keychain Access menu, choose Preferences.\n  \n*Click General, then click Reset My Default Keychain.\n  \n*Authenticate with your account login password.\n  \n*Quit Keychain Access.\n  \n*Restart your computer.\n  \n\nNOTE: if you reset the keychain, it won't give you access to the keychain you already have.\n", "Q: How to display icons in finder in newest to oldest order in a grid? Is there a way to make the finder show icons in newest to oldest order in a grid?\nAs it is when I pick \"View->As Icons\" and then \"View->Arrange By->Date Modified\" the finder displays them in long rows. The first row is \"yesterday\", the second row is items in the previous 7 days, then a row for 30 days, then a row for the previous year. There's 286 files in that row. Navigating by scrolling across the row is nearly useless. There's a \"Show All\" but that' also useless as it shows all the files a year old but in alphabetical order so for example if I want to find files from November last year I'm S.O.L.\nIs there way to just display them in one long grid in newest to oldest order?\n\nA: To sort by modified in icon view:\nGo to the settings for your finder window by clicking on the gear icon at it's top and choosing View Options. You've already set it to arrange by date modified, but you also need to set it to sort by date modified. \nThen you'll have groupings to minimize until you reach the date range you are looking through AND a list of items to scroll through that's sorted by date.\n*as an aside, in figuring this out, I noticed that the sections aren't entirely accurate for me in 10.9.5 (items from 2014 are in the 2013 section), but the files are in the correct order - so don't necessarily trust the section headers. Interesting glitch. \nAs a tip - You could change to list view to see where the modification dates are about where you want to be, select an item to mark your place and then switch back to icon view. Another note - to find where you'd clicked after clicking show all, just arrow key to the left or right and your view will scroll to the selected file.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Another way to do it: (Mavericks 10.8 if it makes a difference):\nUse Command-J or right-click (Control-Click on my fairly stock system) or select \"View Options\" from the gear icon pulldown menu on the window to pull up the options dialog.

I am going to be installing a SSD into my 2011 15\" Macbook Pro. After I install the SSD, how should I boot into OS X Recovery? Should I use Internet Recovery even though my Mac came with OS X 10.7; Now running 10.10.1? Or should I create an OS X Recovery USB Drive? Once I get into Recovery, I will use my Time Capsule restore to my SSD.\n\nA: Personally, I do not believe that you want to boot into recovery mode. Rather, if you're installing a new SSD into your Mac, the most effective path is to boot to a USB that has the OS X Yosemite installer loaded on it. \nFirst things first, you will need a USB drive that has greater than 4 GB of space. Fall the instructions on this Apple help article for how to create your your Yosemite USB installer:\n“Create a bootable installer for OS X Mavericks or Yosemite - Apple Support”\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nAfter you've created your bootable installer, please make sure to back up to your time capsule. You may want to take the extra time and perform a manual backup of your most vital files on a separate external hard drive.\nWhen you have your bootable installer and a fresh back up you may begin the process of replacing the original hard drive with the new solid-state. After installing the SSD, you will hold the 'C' button during boot up which will allow you to specify which disc to start up from. Please see this Apple help article which articulates possible key values during start up:\n“Startup key combinations for Intel-based Macs - Apple Support”\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\nAlthough your SSD is most likely blank I find it good practice to ensure this fact by selecting disk utility from the available menus and wiping the SSD. You can also take this step further by re-formatting your drive to Mac OS Extended (journaled).\nWith your SSD squeaky clean it is time to install the fresh version of OS X Yosemite from the USB drive. You may select your Time machine back up during installation, or you may choose to wait until after install. \n\nA: I just got an SSD for my old MBP mid 2009.  I had a hard disk enclosure - $9.99, works very well, and is quick and easy to install/remove drives. I put the old disk in it, and the blank SSD into the Mac, then used disk utility to erase the SSD.  \nYou can then boot from the USB drive (former system) recovery mode, and use internet install to install the OS fresh on the SSD.  You can always choose to boot from the old drive if you forgot anything.\n\nA: If you have an external USB enclosure, you could do what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the new SSD in the enclosure.\n\n*Use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your internal to the new drive. (Works for everything except Bootcamp partitions, for which you need WinClone)\n\n*Swap drives.\n\n*Done.\nNot free, but solid.\n", "Q: Share one calendar - keep other calendar local I would like to share a family calendar between my wife (Android phone) and me (iPhone) using a Google calendar.\nCurrently I don't store my personal calendar in the cloud but only locally on the iPhone.

All of the files on the Drobo have been copied from an old Xserve setup and various external drives and at least one other Mac's user folder.\nI have my own admin account on the mini, then a small handful of users with local accounts on the mini (added through the Users panel) in a single Group which I've given access to the fileshare. Eventually there will be two Groups, one for administrative stuff that will be in a separate folder that the other users can't access. So, fairly simple.\nIs there a proper way in Server to reset all ownership and permissions for the entire fileshare? I'd like to start with the cleanest slate possible. I'm comfortable with the usual simple Linux chmod/chown commands but completely unfamiliar with the ACL and umask and what not, but am not afraid to cut and paste into Terminal. :) Basically I'd want to be sure to wipe out any old ownerships or other stuff from other machines, and make sure everything is set up so we don't run into any problems down the line with new files or modifying old ones.\nThanks in advance! \n\nA: I believe the proper commands for this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*ACL\nsudo chmod -RN /Path/to/your/share\n\n\n*POSIX (assuming the short name for your local admin account is 'admin' and you want everyone to have read-access, if not change 744 to 740)\nsudo chown -R admin:wheel /Path/to/your/share\nsudo chmod -R 744 /Path/to/your/share\n\n\nA: I use the GUI, it easier... When I migrate a server, I: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add the shares to the 'File Sharing' section of the server app.\n\n*Configure the permissions as I would like them to be. \n\n*Navigate to your server under the 'Server' section on the left of the server app, select 'Storage' from the tabs and then navigate to where your share is located and select it. \n\n*Click on the 'Gear' at the bottom of the page and select 'Edit permissions' and check that they look right, i.e. remove any inherited ones and ensure the correct users / groups have the correct permissions. Then click 'Ok'\n\n*Click the 'Gear' again and this time select 'Propagate permissions' and select all options and click 'Ok'. This might take a while(30 minutes or more, depending in the size of the share), you need to wait. \n\n\nNotes: Sometimes I use 'Batchmod' ( get from Internet Archive now; the original site no longer works: http://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/ ) or chmod, chgrp, chown if I am having trouble changing the file ownership before the above steps, it's not always necessary.\n", "Q: Can't install WordGrinder on Yosemite Recently, I have been trying to install WordGrinder on Yosemite. First I tried getting the latest tar packages from the developers' website and using them, but I ran into some library linking errors with lua and ncursesw. I tried using MacPorts because I assumed that it would do all of that for me, but it turns out that the problems I encountered first were just confusion left over from some earlier dirty MacPorts installs - I ran port selfupdate and those went away. After yet more difficulty with MacPorts, I decided to reconsider building from source. But now, when I use make, I get the following series of errors:\n\nMaat:wordgrinder-0.5.1 Matt$ make\nCC .obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o\nerror: unable to open output file '.obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o': 'Error opening output file '.obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o': Permission denied'\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [.obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o] Error 1\nMaat:wordgrinder-0.5.1 Matt$ sudo make\nCC .obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o\nsrc/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.c:164:8: error: use of undeclared identifier 'KEY_EVENT'\n                case KEY_EVENT: return \"KEY_EVENT\";\n                     ^\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [.obj/release/src/c/arch/unix/cursesw/dpy.o] Error 1\nMaat:wordgrinder-0.5.1 Matt$ \n\nFirst, I have to use sudo to get the compiler to access the output file (I don't think I am supposed to have to do that, but not the main issue), and then, when I do, I run into the other one, about the \"use of undeclared identifier 'KEY_EVENT'\". I went over the makefile and the README.Unix several times, but I can't make head nor tail of it. I read in another, unrelated issue with installing WordGrinder on OS X that \"building on Mac is a pig,\" and now I can't help but agree. What is going wrong, and how can I get WordGrinder to install properly on OS X?\nEDIT 3:\nIn the end, I wiped my convoluted /usr/local and /opt folders and reorganized a large portion of my filesystem. I installed Homebrew on the clean slate I had created, then installed lua and Homebrew/dupes/ncurses using Homebrew as per the steps Alistair listed in his answer. I then downloaded wordgrinder-0.5.2.1 instead of wordgrinder-0.5.1, because 0.5.2.1 had added Homebrew installation support. No more issues with the backspace key. At this point, wordgrinder-static would run, but wordgrinder wouldn't (again, as Alistair reported). Installing luafilesystem allowed wordgrinder to run, as I predicted in an earlier revision of this answer. I used Homebrew to install luarocks in my Cellar (brew install luarocks) and then used luarocks to install luafileystem in my /usr/local/lib/luarocks/rocks directory. wordgrinder now runs perfectly well, with no issues.\nMany thanks to Alistair for all the help. I did learn a lot more than I already did in the process of trying to get this to work, and may be able to take on the rest myself - as I said earlier, I will document my results here as I come up with them.\n\nA: UPDATE: As pointed out by Matthew below, the recently released 0.5.2.1 has better support for OS X and brew now, so downloading, extracting wordgrinder-0.5.2.1.tar.bz2 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordgrinder/files/wordgrinder/ and running make should work. The only dependency you need to install through brew now seems to be lua, so brew install lua first if you don't already have lua installed.\nORIGINAL: Here's how I got it to work with the previous version...\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded and extracted the wordgrinder-0.5.1.tar.bz2 file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordgrinder/files/wordgrinder/\n\n*Used brew to install lua: brew install lua\n\n*Used brew to install ncurses from homebrew-dupes: brew install homebrew/dupes/ncurses\n\n*Made the following modifications to the Makefile. You can download the modified file here.\n\n*\n\n*added a definition of z_crc_t\n\n*modified LDFLAGS so it can find libraries installed through brew\n\n*modified CPPFLAGS and INCLUDES so it can find include files installed through brew\n\n*modified ldflags because it is looking for \"lua5.2\" but the library on OS X is called \"lua.5.2\"\n\n\n*Ran make which runs okay with these changes. bin/wordgrinder crashes right away but bin/wordgrinder-static seems to run okay.\n\n*'sudo make install' fails, so I just copied wordgrinder-static to /usr/local/bin and it appears to work successfully there.\n\n\nA: Based on the information Alistair and Matthew already provided, I was able to install wordgrinder under both Mavericks and Yosemite through a combination of the two methods he described. In fact, I was able to run wordgrinder, not just wordgrinder-static. Steps to reproduce:\nbrew install lua\nbrew install Homebrew/dupes/ncurses\nbrew install luarocks\nbrew install zlib\nluarocks install luafilesystem\n\nand then, in the extracted wordgrinder-0.5.2.1 folder.\nmake\nsudo make install PREFIX=/usr\n\nAlistair and Matthew provided more useful information here than I was able to locate in any number of forums and mailing lists.\n", "Q: SSD: MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (A1398) and 13\" (A1425) compatibility?

Except default TextEdit app I'm a Mac user who is a Japanese. I usually type Japanese using Google IME  which enables me to type it with predictive texts so that we can type it faster.\n\nGoogle IME\nhttp://www.google.co.jp/ime/\nIn terms of English, I can't find good tools such as IME and a text editor. Does anyone know of one?\n\nA: This question may have already been answered by How to setup predictive text (autocomplete) on Mac?, which states:\n\nThe closest things I've found to what you are looking for are this\n  text editor experiment that you have to compile yourself\nhttp://alvinalexander.com/java/type-ahead-continuous-predictive-text-editor-auto-complete\nAnd this Chrome extension for Gmail https://complete.li\nBoth would require you to type in their respective places and then\n  paste into your application of choice, but I haven't found anything\n  that works systemwide.\n\nHowever, just to complete the answer, there is a IME type method built into TextEdit, that can be activated by hitting the ESCAPE key, so if you type \"beg\" then the system will bring up a selection of words beginning with \"beg\", thus:\n\nHowever, the title of your question implies that you do not want to use that text editor. However, TextEdit is a system wide text entry mechanism so that particular functionality should be available in a number of text entry fields across the system.\nEvernote has an autocomplete system, that relies on the the MAcOS autocomplete.\nThere is another method, using Emacs, which has an autocompletion mechanism. Again, though, it is tied to use within one particular application, although it is an extremely versatile application, if a little tricky to learn to use.\nSo, in summary, there appears to be no system-wide IME type functionality, apart rom the one built into OS X's TextEdit mechanism.

I suspect that this may be due to the space in the keyword \"attachment names\".\nWhen I define the search criteria in Finder and pick Attachment names from the menu, it does return the correct results (see screenshot #2, I cut out the actual results).\n\nNote: I tried leaving out the space, but that did not work. However, for another keyword, \"Color space\", using \"colorspace\" does work...\nNote 2: Attachments are only one example, I'm looking for a solution that works for any keyword that contains of more than one word.\n\nA: This is not an answer.

Using Yosemite, I want to use CMD + mouse wheel up/down in order to zoom in/out(CMD +/- equivalent).\nHow can it be achieved?\n\nA: CMD + mouse wheel in most cases doesn't increase the font size, it's usually in most circumstances a 'zoom' in. Increasing the font size system wide isn't possible without setting it specifically for Applications (if you know the menu title) in keyboard shortcuts. However, you can emulate a system wide zoom in level with a double tap of the mouse (if your using magic mouse) by turning that system feature on in:\nSystem Prefs > Mouse > Smart Zoom \nOr you can take advantage of Accessibility feature which is turned on by default by zooming the window in:\nCMDOPT=\nTo emulate this with a mouse scroll event go to :\nSystem Prefs > Accessibility > Zoom\nYou will a list of options for you customize your scroll events. \n\n'Use Gesture Scroll Events' will be greyed out by system default.

I tried the option of open and repair, but still no luck. Any suggestions on how to get it to work? I need to have someone edit the pages document in word because they only have access to word.\n\nA: Something you could try is installing LibreOffice and opening the Word formatted document there and immediately resaving it. I've found that LibreOffice is much more forgiving and saving a document through it will result in a file that Word will be able to open without issue. Same with Excel formatted spreadsheets that refuse to open in Excel.\nI usually end up installing LibreOffice on every machine I use specifically for this reason.\n", "Q: Disable animation for \"Swipe between full-screen apps\"? Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9.5) and Yosemite (10.10) offer a mouse and trackpad gesture, Swipe between full-screen apps. Works well as full-screen apps are treated like a Mission Control desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Magic Trackpad – Three finger swipe to the right or left.\n\n*Magic Mouse – Two finger swipe to the right or left.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is the animation of the full-screen app sliding to the left or right as the other app/desktop/space slides alongside it. All this sliding makes me dizzy or nauseous. Especially bad during presentations to an audience, when I switch between Keynote app and other apps. \n➥ Any way to disable or alter this left/right sliding animation?\n➥ Is there some other way to switch between full-screen apps?\nBetween, Not Into, Full-Screen Apps\nThis question is not a duplicate of questions such as this one that ask about disabling the animation into full-screen mode. My question is about the animation switching (\"swiping\") between full-screen app(s).\n\nA: Sys Pref > Reduce motion\nYou can replace the horizontal sliding screen effect with a gentle fade-in, where one screen translucently covers and replaces the other. Works on macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nA faster/slower swipe of your fingers make a faster/slower fade-in. You can even stop mid-swipe to show the other screen translucently covering the present screen.\nChoose System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion.\n\n\nA: You can control the animation speed by not swiping your fingers as fast. The actual code is quite tightly coupled into the OS and there's been no signs of people finding a hidden setting to speed up or even change the animations.\nYou could also use mission control to have the screen animation come down from above if the nausea is caused by left-right visual motion.\nLastly, if you really need to control the motion, you might have to pre-record the screen and just speak to it. Keynote and editing the video would allow you to fade to black or use another transition idiom than a wipe.\n", "Q: Remove an erroneous email address from iCal invitee list I would like to remove an erroneous email address from an event's auto-completion list (via Add Invitee) in iCal.\nOX S' Mail application provides a Remove from Previous Recipients List option,  accessible from a drop-down menu located at the right edge of an email address:\n\nIs there a way to do so in iCal?

A few days ago I was charging my phone in my car and it stopped charging, and I noticed that the cord had a little hole and smoke was coming out of there. I was buying some food from a local shop, and the guy working there knew me and said he had tons of cords, so he gave me one that he had at the store. After I started using this one, my battery has been going crazy. If I charge it to full power, I would wake up and find it under 10%. And if I charge it and use it during the day, it would drain very quickly. I thought the problem was because of the cord he gave me so I went to Best Buy to buy an Apple one and the guy there said that that was a long shot, and it's probably something else. I did use my uncle's iPad cord and the same problem is still there. I have no clue what happened. This battery thing literally happened overnight, it wasn't gradual and it's never been this bad. Can anyone help? \nP.S. I have iOS 8.1.2 (not the latest one due to lacking storage)\n\nA: In order for cables to smoke the current must have exceeded all limits of the design by 10x.\nSince the battery is connected true it, it would have gotten a shock of its life, and now no longer been able to hold the charge.\nThe guy at Best Buy was right, it is not the cable any more since the damage was done.\n", "Q: Replace iSight camera on MacBook Air late 2010 (A1369) My MacBook got a small water damage some time ago. Luckily everything still works without any problems except the iSight camera, which is no longer detected. I reinstalled Mac OS X a couple of times since, so I'm sure it's not a software issue. Since a replacement looks pretty cheap and I have all the tools to open up my MacBook, I was wondering, if there are any guides on how to replace the camera. I googled a lot and also checked on Youtube, but could not find anything suitable. How hard would such a replacement be? Can I make sure it's the camera and not some other hardware issue before I try to replace it? On the other hand how much would it cost to have the camera replaced by Apple?\n\nA: The problem with this is that in order to get to the iSight camera, you have to detach the display assembly from the body and then get the casing off, which probably means removing the display gasket and the display itself (non-trivial) because the iSight cable is routed behind the display.\nYou can find guides at iFixit on how to detach the display assembly (seems to be harder with an Air, it was simpler for my MBP), which appears to involve taking everything out of the bottom casing. And then you need to take apart the display. They don't even have a guide for this, you must look elsewhere (Youtube or so, but this should give you the idea that it's difficult).\nLong story short: The replacement part may be cheap, but the procedure isn't, and is probably best left to a professional, unless you know what you are doing.\n", "Q: Game freezing every 10 seconds I'm not sure if this qualifies as a legit question here, but I don't know where else to ask.\nI have installed the Call of Duty 2 MAC version on my iMac.

They do not change anything. The commands may ask for your login password. This is normal.\nI am trying to determine if you are using coreStorage. If not, then\nthe problem might be the age of you computer. The drivers for windows 7 may not be compatible with OS X 10.10.\nSee this Apple Support Communities post: windows 8 does not recognise Macintosh HD, No drive Letter.\nJust a note about the article you reference:\nThe article is full of problems and errors. While it is true the default partition names are \"Macintosh HD\" and \"BOOTCAMP\", often users change these volume names. The author should have known this. Also, if you follow the instructions in the section titled \"Create a Shared FAT32 Partition\", your computer will not be able to boot to windows. The reason for this is simple: Windows can only see the first 4 partitions on your disk. The first partition is the EFI partition. It is normally hidden when viewed in the Disk Utility. The second partition is the HFS+ OS X boot partition. The third is the recovery partition which is hidden also. The Fourth is used as the Windows Bootcamp partition. If you try to insert a FAT32 partition, the Bootcamp partition would become the fifth partitioned, thus preventing windows from booting.\n\nUpdate:\nWell, you are using Core Storage which is probably the problem. Windows does not recognize partitions using Core Storage. My understanding is that Yosemite converted your OS X partition from HFS+ to Core Storage. You need to change it back to HFS+. klanomath at Can't make more than two partitions seems to have the answer. Here he has solved a different problem, but his solution steps should work for your problem as well. I would follow his steps with some minor changes. I have listed them below.\nFor his step 1, I would just use the recovery partition already on your disk. In other words, press the alt key while booting and select the recovery partition to boot to.\nFor his step 3, the command would be: \ndiskutil cs revert 4BB22737-5EFB-49D6-ADF1-5B719538AF45\n\nOmit step 5.\nAlso, I would use the Disk Utility to backup the partition before entering the above command. This would require an external disk to store the image on, which you may not have. If you wish to do this and do not know how, let me know.\nLet me know how things turn out and don't forget to give klanomath some reps.\ndave\n\nA: Your data in Mac drive may be encrypted by FileVault, so other OS suppose not to see this encrypted drive.

You can go to File → Export → iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch & Apple TV...\nThen pick an option.\n \niPod touch & iPhone 3GS is the one that give you the smaller file size with a resolution of 640×400.\nFor the screenshot I test it with a video of 6.9 MB.\n", "Q: How make Mac OS mail Connection Doctor forget older accounts I have created a number of \"internet\" accounts for mail in Mac OS, but for various reasons they didn't work, and I deleted them from the listings in the preferences, and of course they therefore don't appear in the Mac OS Mail app either. In fact, there are now zero accounts registered with mail abilities and zero appearing in my Mail app.\nBUT, if I go to Mail, and choose Connection Doctor, it still scans those old email accounts to see if they can connect or not! \nSo it is clearly \"retaining\" those old accounts... and their credentials!!

Cleanse that oddly cached account info?\nThanks!\n\nA: Apple's Mail app stores the settings for SMTP servers apart from the settings for IMAP/POP3 servers. In my experience, this often leads to the fact that after deleting mail accounts, the SMTP servers are still visible in the connection doctor although all other data regarding a certain internet/email account have been removed.\nIn case the connection doctor shows you only the SMTP accounts of the already deleted mail accounts, please proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail > Settings > Accounts > SMTP-Server > Edit SMTP-Server list\n\n*In the dialog which opens: Select entries in the server list\n\n*Remove items by clicking on the minus-symbol below the list\n\n\nIn case the connection doctor also shows you the IMAP or POP3 account information of the  already deleted mail accounts, proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Re-add the accounts using System Preferences > Internet Accounts\n\n*Open Mail\n\n*Quit Mail\n\n*Remove the accounts using System Preferences > Internet Accounts\n\n\nA: Mail-> \nWindow -> \nConnection Doctor -> \nDouble click the account to erase -> \npress the (-) minus button\n", "Q: Is it possible to set iOS notifcations for certain apps ON / OFF depening on day / time?

As of January 2015, I have a brand new Macbook Air running all fully updated Yosemite 10.10.\nI have been simply trying to configure the mac OS mail app to work with a simple, normal Yahoo Mail account.\nI add the account, it appears correctly in the Preferences settings as an internet account with \"mail\" checked... it creates entries in the left pane of the Mail window.   BUT... nothing ever appears in the Inbox.   AND, it DOES succeed in loading the many sub-folders within the mail account that I have configured in yahoo... AND, if I click on one of those, then after 20 seconds, it loads the folder's contents fine. AND, when I SEND mail, it sends out just fine.  But nothing in the normal, plain Inbox!\nI have created it several times. Once I even tried to force it to allow me to \"manually\" create the inbox without it sniffing that it was a yahoo account and applying the official yahoo settings it knows. I did that by initially putting extra false characters in the yahoo domain name, and then setting up all the IMAP and SMTP stuff manually, and then changing the initial domain name entry to remove the wrong characters.  But the results were exactly the same -- empty inbox.\nAND, when I have yahoo set up in the normal way (but not working right...)  and I go to the Connection Doctor... it scans through and gives the green-light indicator saying that IMAP and SMTP are working fine!\nAny info, tips, or similar issues with Yahoo Mail and the mail.app in Yosemite?\nTHANKS -- Eric\n\nA: I am sure you did all these things, but just in case...\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn POP access in Yahoo mail through browser:\nhttps://help.yahoo.com/kb/mail-for-desktop/SLN15404.html?impressions=true\n\n*Check you IMAP settings in Mail app:\nhttps://help.yahoo.com/kb/imap-server-settings-yahoo-mail-sln4075.html\n\n*Check that you actually do have messages in your Inbox (through browser) :)\n\n*Check that you do not have Forwarding ON:\nhttps://help.yahoo.com/kb/automatically-forward-emails-yahoo-mail-sln22028.html\nIf this didn't help, let's search further...\n\nA: Open the Mail.app then click mailboxes, then click sync mailbox.\n\nA: To troubleshoot email - you can get excellent diagnostic logs from Mail.\n\n\n*\n\n*open connection doctor\n\n*let the tool diagnose any issues\n\n*if you have any warnings or errors - you can narrow them down in a new thread (post exactly how you have mail set up - what protocol, what mail server ports and settings are in use)\n\n*if the lights are green, you can turn on diagnostic logging and get explicit details on how the Mac and the mail server are communicating.\n\n\nWorst case, again, you can post a follow up question with exact details on what is failing and if it's intermittent or permanent. Free mail services generally are less reliable than a paid service, but even with free - you can often pinpoint a configuration change or error message that helps you know if the network is the problem, the mail server is the problem or you need a different client.\n", "Q: How to move photos from an old eMac to an iPad? I need to move about 550 photos from iPhoto on an old eMac to a new iPad Air. The eMac won't be used anymore after everything is transferred. I already tried the following approaches, but they didn’t quite have the expected result:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync photos from iPhoto to iPad using iTunes (because the eMac is too old to run the required version of iTunes for the iPad, I used another Mac as an intermediate on which I set up iPhoto). This creates an album like “Pictures from Mac” that can't be removed, any of these photos must be duplicated before they can be edited.\nThis is not really what's wanted: the idea is to “move” the photos permanently to the iPad, not “make them available on the iPad for viewing”, which is what iTunes sync really seems to do.\n\n*Used the app GoodReader to get the files from the eMac via AFP, then added them from GoodReader to the Photos app. This does what's wanted: the pictures can be edited on the iPad without having to be duplicated (and they can be deleted as well).\nBut all the photos appeared as if they were taken today, rather than on their original date (even though the export from iPhoto to the folder which I accessed through AFP preserved the timestamp of the photos in the “modification timestamp” of the files)\n\n\nHow can I “move” (not “sync”) the photos to the iPad, while preserving the timestamp of the photos?\nSome technical info: the eMac is a 1GHz PowerPC G4 one, running OS X 10.5.8 with iTunes 10.6.3 and iPhoto 5.0.4. Software Update reports everything is up-to-date.\n\nA: I wound up giving PhotoSync a try. This had better (compared to GoodReader), if not entirely satisfying, results: I was able to transfer the photos (after exporting the photos from iPhoto on the eMac and copying them to an intermediate, newer Mac), and found that most had the correct date. But about 150 did not, these appeared as if taken today. I deleted them again for now. I suspect these failed because they don't have any EXIF dates set.\nNext time I meet up with the eMac/iPad owner, I will try transferring the remaining 150 photos again after forcibly setting their EXIF date to the same date as the file's modification date. There's an answer on the Photography SE which details how to do that using the command line utility “exiftool”. I'll try to remember to report back here on whether this works. I’d still appreciate any answer explaining a more straightforward approach.\nEdit: transferring the remaining 150 photos after forcing their EXIF dates was succesful. I'll summarize my approach for anyone wanting to follow it:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the iPad, get PhotoSync from the App Store.\n\n*On an intermediate Mac, get the PhotoSync companion app from the Mac App Store.\n\n*On the intermediate Mac, install “exiftool” (I used MacPorts to do this).\n\n*In iPhoto on the eMac, use the “Export” option in the menu. Make sure to set the options to “Original”. Transfer the exported files to the intermediate Mac. Make sure to use a means of transfer that preserves the file modification dates.\n\n*Use the following Terminal command on the intermediate Mac to fix files without any EXIF dates by setting the EXIF “ModifyDate” to the file modification date:\nexiftool -overwrite_original_in_place -preserve '-FileModifyDate>ModifyDate' -if 'not $DateTimeOriginal' -if 'not $ModifyDate' -if 'not $CreateDate' *\n\n*Open PhotoSync on the iPad, and use the PhotoSync companion app on the intermediate Mac to transfer the files using the “Send” command in the menu.\nNote that a drawback of this approach is that it doesn't preserve the organization of the photos into albums that was done on the eMac, but that was not an issue in my case.\nInstead of PhotoSync, you may be able to use AirDrop to transfer the files, but I was not able to try this as I didn’t have access to a Mac which supports AirDrop to iOS devices.\nBefore fixing any files with exiftool, you may want to move the ones that need fixing to a separate subdirectory: exiftool -Directory=needs_fixing -if 'not $DateTimeOriginal' -if 'not $ModifyDate' -if 'not $CreateDate' *\n\nA: Buy a USB-drive compatible with both machines (may require an adapter or two).\nExport the photos you want to copy, from the eMac to the USB-drive as JPEG files.\nAttach the USB-drive to the iPad and tell Photos to import from the drive.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi always requires manual choice to select desired network We have Wi-Fi at home but each time I turn on my Mac it goes to an unlocked Wi-Fi not our own and I have to go into Wi-Fi on the menu bar to select our own home Wi-Fi.

I've noticed it the last few weeks, but it could have been around longer, perhaps dating back to the Yosemite upgrade. I'm only getting to look at it now.\nMostly macbook works fine, but every now and again it stops talking to the internet. It seems to happen every 15-20 minutes, for a duration ranging from 30 seconds up to 5 minutes. It's mainly an issue for Skype, where I experience occasional disconnections.\nI have run ping youtube.com and it reports Request timeout for <ip-address> at times corresponding to my outages. Note that it does not say No route to host.\nI have also run ping against my router IP-address and this always works without fault. thus issues on wireless interface can be ruled out.\nI have run ping on my actual router too, against the youtube IP-adress, and this reports no fault. this rules out actual service-provider network issues.\nI have run ping from my iPhone, and this reports no problems so the issue is almost certainly something to do with macbook, rather than wifi devices in general.\nApple's wireless diagnostics utilities do detect the outages, but provide no solutions. The tools it provides also show no wireless congestion issues, and no problems with signal.\nI've tried a whole slew of fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling bluetooth\n\n*changing from 802.11g to 802.11n between 2.4GHz and 5 GHz and changing channels.\n\n*setting IPv6 to link-only\n\n*disabling handoff\n\n\nI'm going to have a go at the PRAM reset thing if the issue becomes chronic again, and I really don't think I should have to resort to an O/S reinstall.\nI would like to understand though, even theoretically what is going on here. It's driving me bananas!\n\nA: I discovered that bouncing airport (Disable/Enable on Air Port Icon in the top right) resolved the issue temporarily.\nEventually I tried a PRAM reset and that seems to have fixed the problem for good.\nWould have loved to understand the root cause though ...\nThere is a collection of fixes on reddit here, that people with similar issues might like to try: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2jwah7/psa_yosemite_wifi_issues_list_of_possible_fixes/\n", "Q: Is it possible to set up my phone to automatically be in DND mode during particular calendar events? I already have a recurring scheduled DND set for my phone for every evening through morning. However, I have calendar events that I would like to automatically trigger DND.

So, once the event is over, my phone is back to normal, and I don't have to worry about silencing it myself. Is this possible?\n\nA: Short answer… No.\nThere is no public API that manages the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature. There are also no frameworks that can achieve this.\nGoogling would also say it's not the kind of sandbox breakout Apple would be likely to allow in the future, either.\n\nA: This is a feature I find lacking in the current (and previous) versions of iOS.

How do I get them to stop?\n\nA: I suggest you to go to Mail.app → View → Message → All Headers and analyze that headers.\nIf appears any server not related to iCloud, then copy the content of Mail.app → View → Message → Raw Source window and report in spamcop.net.\n\nA: I found this post searching for an answer. Like the original poster, I've been receiving spam that appears to be coming from my email address (icloud). When I clicked on it from my phone, it seemed to be my address. I thought I had been hacked, even though I'd changed my password - a few times. It never occurred to me it could be coming from someplace else. But it was! Here's how I found out...\nFrom my computer, I marked it as \"junk\". When I went to my junk folder to delete it, it no longer showed it coming from my account. It showed the actual sender. Mystery solved!Thank you, Tetsujin!\n\nA: Norton (welknown from the PC world) did write this: The good news is no one has hacked into your account. What you’re experiencing is called “Form spoofing,” and it’s a favorite tool in the spam artillery.\nForm-spoofing is annoying, but it’s not dangerous. It’s the sender entering your name and address into the From field in their mail program instead of their own. Outlook, for one, makes this a snap. During the setup process, when asked to enter one’s own email address, spammers choose this option.\nSince the name of the game for spammers is hiding their tracks and making sure you receive their mail, from-spoofing is natural. By putting your address in the From field, they obscure the true sender and nearly guarantee that your spam filter won’t block their email. - It's like you can write any returnaddress on an envelope before you drop it into a mailbox. \nIt's getting real annoying, when you block your own emailaddress, you can risk you can't recieve any mail anymore. They think they can force you to buy their shity stuff when you can't prevent their spam anymore... and they demonstrate at the same time, they know nothing about the human mind and about we would never buy anything, when getting pretty annoyed and angry.

This has been mentioned in this question here:\nWhat's the difference between alias and link?\nBut I am not even sure what I am looking for.

For example, would I create ln /path/from/file /path/from/file?\nThe above command does something like it I believe.\n\nA: Both hard links and symbolic links link a path to a destination, however there is a substantial difference you should be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard links link a path to a file. This means that if you rename/move the destination file, the hard link follows.\n\n*Symbolic links link a path to a path. This means if you rename/move the destination file, the link is broken.

This is quite annoying to me, since I work with many LaTeX documents, which I recompile often to verify how changes in LaTeX code render in the PDF.\nThe question is, can I bring back the previous behavior of reopening PDF on the same page in Preview or I'm forced to change my default PDF viewer to other application?\nNote that the option \"Start on the last viewed page\" in Preview preferences is enabled. However it seems to work only when Preview is closed and then reopened. It does not work when the PDF file is changed.\n\nA: I always ⌘+W to close the current preview then compile. Preview then reopens at the last position, with modifications. It's not that convenient, but works for me.\n\nA: If you're wondering about the whole LaTeX thingy, have you ever considered another LaTeX compiler? I normally use texmaker because it has a built-in pdf viewer and i love it!\nInstead if you want the behaviour back by default, i reckon it can't be done (same behaviour on OS X 10.10 Yosemite and OS X 10.11 El Capitan)\n\nA: If you work with LaTeX I would suggest you to use TeXShop, which has a built-in pdf viewer, which keeps track of the page you last opened, even after re-compiling. Moreover, it can \"synchronize\" between the source and the pdf output document (and vice versa), meaning that a (command-) click on a word in the source highlights the same word in the pdf, and the other way around (very convenient!).\nInstead of installing TeXShop only, you can download and install the full MacTeX-Distribution, which includes TeXShop, BibDesk and more.\n", "Q: gifs in slideshow or screensaver Is there any way to show gif (animated) images in a slideshow or a screensaver?

The command key temporarily \"locks\" the Dock, so that drags to/from the Dock do not affect it. This is new in Yosemite. The purpose is two-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*When dragging a document to the Dock, it prevents icons already present from \"dancing away\" from the one you're dragging, making it easier to drop a document onto an app in the Dock.\n\n*When dragging a document from the Dock, it lets the Dock know you intend to drop it somewhere (such as on an application or into your Finder sidebar) and are not trying to remove it.\nYou might object \"I would know if I were holding down the command key.\" But it's possible you are inadvertently enabling \"Sticky Keys\". By default, Sticky Keys is turned on/off by pressing the shift key five times in a row. This is easy to do if you are playing a game that uses the shift key as a fire button.\nWhen Sticky Keys is turned on, tapping any of the modifier keys (command, control, shift, option) makes the modifier key \"stick\", even after you lift your finger from the key, until you press a non-modifier key. The purpose is to facilitate use of the computer by someone who can press only one key at a time.\nNote that dragging something to/from the Dock is a mouse action, not a \"non-modifier key\", and does not release the sticky modifier.\nTapping a modifier key twice in a row locks it, similar to how Caps Lock works. The key behaves as if pressed until you tap it again to unlock it.\nIf Sticky Keys has become activated, it's easy to press the command key intending to invoke some keyboard shortcut, and then change your mind. You lift your finger from the key, but Dock (and all your other apps) think you're still holding the key down. \n\nA: Just killing the com.apple.dock.plist from the finder may not work because the system holds the current settings in memory and will just write them back. \nYou could try and delete it from Terminal.app\n\nUpdate.\nGo to  ~/Library/Application Support  folder in Finder and remove the folder:\nDock  (this holds a dock database )\nThen in terminal type and run\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock.plist;killall Dock\n\nA: Do you use an app, such as TinkerTool (http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) to modify the way your system works?\n\nI had a similar problem, except that it wasn't time bound (to my testing). I simply couldn't re-arrange the dock icons, no matter what options I had selected (in TinkerTool).\nFinally, I decided to reset the options in TinkerTool, logout, and log back in. This solved it for me.\n\nIf you haven't used any such apps, I think you could try downloading TinkerTool, playing around with the options it has for the dock, and finally, if nothing else works, do a reset of the TinkerTool options.\nNote that I chose the option \"Reset to pre-TinkerTool state\" first, and immediately after I chose \"Reset to defaults\".\nI hope this works for you as well!\n\nA: If your issue is not resolved yet, I can come up with a series of things that might be happening but require some digging. You already commented somewhere that you found the solution in a Chrome extension, but if someone else arrives here with a similar issue but without using Chrome or an extension, this might prove useful.\nFirst step is to check if this issue is system-wide or bound to your user account.\nMake a new account via System Preferences, log out, and log in to the new account. Use the preinstalled Apple apps and see if the problem is still there.\nIf so, the issue has to do with something you installed and is running as an application or service in the background. It might also be something that hooked in to MCX which is a system designed for network administrators to make settings stick on computers.\nIf the issue is gone, it is only in your account. This means it is restricted to whatever applications are running when you log in, and any files and settings in your home folder. To figure out what is causing the problem, the following data is needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*List of files in ~/Library/LaunchAgents (if this directory exists)\n\n*List of files in ~/Library/LaunchDaemons (if this directory exists)\n\n*List of items in the extensions panel in the system preferences\n\n*List of items in the Login Items in the Users & Groups panel (also sys prefs)\n\n*List of applications that you have set to automatically start when you log in on the dock\n\n\nThis gives a list of all he possible items that might influence the normal operation of the Dock. The ~/ is a shorthand for your user home directory. The ~/Library directory can be accessed from the Finder by holding the Option key (or Alt key) and clicking the \"Go\" menu and then the Library item.\nThe next bit of data comes from the Activity Monitor. When you log in, please open the Activity Monitor, find the Dock item in the list of processes and double click it. This opens the detail view on the Dock process. The third tab, \"Open files and Ports\" contains a list of files the dock has opened. Copy that list here (or use a pasting service like pastebin.com ), which will give us a list of all the files that the Dock is using. If there is anything in there that doesn't belong there, that would be the culprit.\nNext bit of data would be form the system logs. Console is the application you can use to view the logs and get specific data using the searching and filtering options. What you could do is start it and keep it open, and as soon as the Dock locks up (not allowing you to move items), check to see if the logs are suddenly showing things related to the Dock, or any application you have open, or maybe sandboxd, OpenGL or WindowServer. Copy those lines (and again, if it is a lot of text a pasting service like pastern.com might be useful to not bloat your post) and that might tell us what is happening.\nNot begin able to drag anything around inside the dock but having everything else working leads me to believe that either something is locking the icons down, which is a supported function in the Dock, or an external application is trying to interface with the Dock for some sort of functionality and it is doing something wrong and thereby breaking some functions. The Dock is more than just a Dock, it also manages certain aspects of window swithcing, application switching, mission control, launching services and if I remember correctly some clipboard functions.\nAfter you have collected the data, you might be able to restart the Dock from the Activity Monitor by using the \"Quit\" button at the bottom of that detail window you opened by double clicking the Dock from the process list. Hint: to stop the process list form bouncing around, sort it by name. \n\nA: Trying to rearrange Dock icons on 10.10.2 new MacBook Pro 13\" Retina, I had this problem too.  Accidentally hit on dragging while holding down fn key; huh?  But it worked!\n\nA: I’m using 10.10.3 on a mid-2010 15\" MacBook pro, and found the same problem. It seems that clicking on a particular dock icon very quickly opens the pop-up “Options…” menu immediately above it, and the icon is frozen in place. However, if I’m quick enough, I can move the icon before that menu appears, and icon remains movable for as long as I hold the trackpad “click.” Is it supposed to work this way? Who knows? Worth a try if it avoids some of the more exotic solutions offered above.\nUPDATE: I got around to stopping in at a nearby Simply Mac store to see if my approach worked on any of their machines. Before I could explain the \"problem,\" the nice sales clerk proceeded to move a dock icon exactly as I had at home. Seems that IS the way it's suppose to work!\n\nA: I do not have the \"Pushbullet\" chrome extension. For me it was a bit of misunderstanding and actually quite silly, I'm a developer and live mostly in the shell/terminal so I'm still quite unfamiliar with the GUI. I came from one computer (2012 Air) to my new computer\nI wanted to remove some icons from the dock. I tried dragging them off, at this point a tooltip with the word \"remove\" would appear, when I let go the icon would just slide right back to my dock, \"wut?\".\nMy Solution\nIf an application isn't set to \"keep in dock\" then you won't be able to drag it off the dock, you'll experience what I mentioned above. All you have to do is... close the application, and it disappears off the dock.\nMy Case\nI was trying to remove \"chrome\" from my dock since I use alfred to launch everything. I wasn't able to remove it, once I realized what I mentioned previously, it was a \"duh\" moment. I was then able to see that I could remove the apps from the dock that were indeed \"locked\" to it.\n\nA: Hold down \"fn\" key, then drag icons on Dock to desired position.\n\nA: I had this issue on my 2016 MacBook Pro 13\".  It had something to do with the haptic feedback trackpad. If I pushed firmly slowly, I noticed that it clicked twice and the second click shrunk the window (or said no windows available if the app I was trying to move was not live); this action would not let me move the icon. However if I press gently and move the icon quickly so would engage the first click, but not the second click, I could now move the icon. There may be some trackpad setting that I can have it turn off the hard and soft click but I am tired of monkeying with it for now.\n\nA: click and hold the ALT key, then mouse click and hold the icon you want to move. Took me a couple of times before I got the icon moving, but it worked for me.\n\nA: If you have a USB mouse connected and are also using an Apple wireless mouse, disconnect the wired mouse.\nFor me the problems went away when I did this.\nThe issue returned as soon as the USB mouse was plugged in again, even though not using it. I guess this could point to an issue with the generic driver software for the USB mouse?\nThis and other dock-related issues were driving me nuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*unable to move dock items in Yosemite 10.10.5\n\n*unable to add dock items by drag and drop\n\n*dock autohide feature not working\n\n*item magnification not working unless mouse clicked\n\n*other weird behaviours.\n\n\nI tried all previously suggested prefs deletions and resets without joy.\n\nA: I just changed Dock preferences from Genie effect to Scale effect an it fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Creating System-Wide Keyboard Shortcut To Launch Applications I recently switched from Ubuntu, and I was feeling very comfortable with using Ctrl + Alt + T to launch terminal. Can I assign Shift + Cmd + T to do the same thing in Yosemite? Specifically, I want a new terminal window to be opened.\n\nA: Most system events can be directly handled and manipulated with Automator. Automator is highly resourceful, yet not taken advantage of. I'll walk you through the steps to creating a system wide keyboard shortcut for opening any application, but in your case, Terminal.\nStep 1 : Open Automator [located in Applications > Automator]\nStep 2 : Create a New Service for your 'Document Type'\n\nStep 3 : Before moving forward with anything else, ensure you change the input methods in the top right sidebar to where it is now capable of running without any input in a specific application. Emulate the following picture:\n\nStep 4 : Click on the Library tab 'Utilities' > Drag and Drop the 'Launch Application' into your workflow. Select your Application, in your case, you will have to manually find it by selecting 'other'. Your screen should now resemble mine:\n\nStep 5 : Save your Service to whatever name you want, for this instance, I went ahead and saved mine as Launch Terminal, you'll see why this is important in a minute. \nStep 6 : Navigate to your System Preferences > Keyboard > 'Shortcuts' tab.\nStep 7 : Click on the 'Services' tab in the left side bar and all your services will populate. Navigate to the 'General' section, and since it's a newly created service, it will automatically be turned on by default. Here is where you can set your keyboard shortcut. [THERE WILL NOT BE ONE BY DEFAULT]\n\nStep 8 : Close your System Preferences after you set the shortcut and test it out! Voila! Magnifico! \nThere are some things to consider when selecting your shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*SHIFT+CMD+T is a widely used variable. The shortcut you set shouldn't be a keyboard shortcut used elsewhere. Since we didn't specify an input or specific application, this shortcut can be used system wide. However if an app already is hard coded to use this keyboard shortcut, yours will be overrided. Safari has the same short cut, so the Application will override your service keyboard shortcut. So use a pattern of keys not used elsewhere.  For safety I used : SHIFT+CONTROL+OPTION+CMD+T as no other applications really use that. You can use whatever you want, I just wanted to clear that up before people commented.\n\n*Why is saving the name appropriately important? Services populate according to the types of files you select in finder in the right click contextual menu. So for example: you select a finder menu item that is a picture and you have a service set to resize those photos, the contextual menu will populate that service in there :    As you can see the service populates in your contextual menu, that doesn't matter now since you didn't specify input or an application when creating the workflow in Yosemite, but you don't know how this will effect future OS releases.\n\n\nA: There are some good options here but I wanted to add my personal favorite which I've been using since 10.5 and still works on 10.11.2: Spark 3.\nhttp://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php\nIt's freeware and extremely easy to set up.  Here's the developer's description:\n\nSpark is a powerful, and easy Shortcuts manager. With Spark you can\n  create Hot Keys to launch applications and documents, execute\n  AppleScript, control iTunes, and more... You can also export and\n  import your Hot Keys library, or save it in HTML format to print it.\n  Spark is free, so use it without moderation!\n\nHere's a screenshot of the interface:\n\n\nA: Another option is to use the free menubar app Apptivate. I use it hundreds of times/day.\nDescription from the site:\n\nUse global hotkeys or the Apptivate interface to: Launch, hide and quick peek applications; Execute scripts; Run Automator workflows; Instant access to files and folders; Hotkey sequences\n\nWhat I love about Apptivate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not only launches an app (or folder, script, doc) via global hotkey (if it isn't currently running), but the same hotkey also brings the app's window(s) to the foreground if already running and hides them if the app currently has the focus.\n\n*Easily create/change/find hotkeys from the menubar drop-down \n\n*The quick peek feature is great for quickly referencing something in one app while working in another.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I view a previous day's steps in the Health app? The iOS 8 Health app shows the current day's data for steps in the Dashboard and when viewing Steps individually.

However, I see no way to view the totals for a previous day, i.e. if I walked 10000 steps yesterday, is it possible to see that within the app?\n\nA: I don't believe there is a way to do it through the Health app, but 3rd party apps do have the ability to show this.

I wasn't even going to try those which suggested I install yet another app from the web.\nSeeing as I could not even start Safari the above was not useful. I could start Safari in Safe mode, but there was nothing there - possibly because when it originally wanted access to all my private data I refused. \nActivity Monitor showed an Installer and this had ~/Library/Application Support/com.genieoinnovation.Installer/Completer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer open.\nI deleted this directory.

I don't remember seeing this before. Is there a way (terminal flag, perhaps) to turn this off so the Subject of the message isn't truncated?\n\n\nA: This is an important feature because it creates a quick visual tool to let you know what Inbox it's located in without actually opening the message or right clicking on your To: address. When using universal inbox like this, it's important, however the subject line isn't truncated because of this, the subject line gets truncated based of the width of your Sort Column or 'Messages' Column. In fact, even the inbox account name gets truncated when the column width is less than stellar. Simply enlarge the column width to an appropriate size that makes you happy. Otherwise, the only option you could do is turn off the contact photos which will give you an extra 100 pixels or so of space. You can find that setting in Preferences > Viewing > Show contact Photos in the message list\nTo answer the question specifically though, it's truncated because of the column width, alter the size and it will no longer be truncated. \n", "Q: How to tell Mac Mail that a sender isn't spam?

For Yosemite, and I'm sure Mavericks, go to the Junk Mail folder and click on the Email in reference, you can either right click and 'Mark' > 'As Not Junk Mail' or simply click on the 'Not Junk' button in the email header.

How I can I deny the users the ability to upgrade to the iOS version when available?\nSo my question: is there a method to disallow the user to update the iOS version on the iPad?\n\nA: In a word, no.\nIt is not possible, either with Apple Configurator, or other MDM solutions, to restrict users from updating iOS when new versions are released.\nBeing able to update iOS without simultaneously being able to update apps (as can be set up using supervised iDevices in Apple Configurator) can lead to big problems, such as incompatible apps and lost data.\n", "Q: How to change NTP server in airport express? Is it possible to change NTP server in AirportExpress? Is there any other way to control this device than Airpot Utility?\n\nA: Although the GUI has lost a lot of functionality, there is a workaround.\nIn AU, select the device and click 'edit'. Under the File menu export the config, which you can then edit, and import it using the same menu. The relevant tag is\n<key>ntSV</key>\n<string>time.apple.com</string>\n\nYou will need to be very careful with your editing or you may render it unbootable! You will need to restart for the config change to take effect. I've done this with a Time Capsule: I expect that this is possible with Airport Express too, but do not have access to one to experiment with.\n\nA: I believe older version of Airport Utiltiy had a GUI that you could set.

I would like to buy a second-hand iPhone 5C and use it for testing purposes. Aside from hardware specs, are there any limitations specific to 5C that I should be aware of? Also, given that I want to buy it second-hand, what should I be looking for to ensure the phone can be used for development?\n\nA: Short Answer : YES.\nIn depth : I am a developer and I have all devices, and most models concerning iOS. The thing about developing, as you will learn, with Apple is that they have strict guidelines, guidelines with pros and cons. These pros in your instance work in your favor. Apple requires all apps to be cross-platform compatible, even if the app is not specifically designed for that device. For example, they require all iPhone apps to be compatible with iPads, even if your not developing for iPad specifically, the app just must simply run as advertised in 1x or 2x mode as fluidly as it does for the device you specifically design for. The iPhone 5C is just as good as any other device. Furthermore, you can utilize the built in testing simulator, that has all the devices you may not own. You will have no issues, developing with the 5c, provided who you buy it from sells you a working device.\n", "Q: Dictionary + Thesaurus items duplicated How can I remove the duplicated menu items?\nThey show duplicated in the Dashboard Dictionary widget as well, so I guess they get manifested from some general setting.

I'm running 10.6.8 and when I try to use BootCamp, it tells me I need \"at least 10GB of free space\", which is interesting since I have 21GB of free space. However, trying to fix this issue has seemed pointless at this rate and I remember there used to be way to create bootable USBs using only Disk Utility during the Vista era. I had tried converting my .iso to .dmg and mounting them and 'burning' them to the flash drive, but nothing has seemed to work. All the tutorials I have found online use BootCamp, which is what I want to stay away from since it does not work for me.\nSo is there a way to do this? And what is the recommended file type .iso, .img, or .dmg to be used? Should it be mounted or unmounted when I try to 'burn' it?\n\nA: None of the answers got it right.\nThis is how you do it — without BootCamp:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get/download a Windows ISO image file.\n\n*Your USB flash drive should have at least 8GB.\n\n*Plug it in and format/erase it using Disk Utility (under Applications/Utilities)\n\n\n*\n\n*CAUTION: Make sure you select the correct drive! Then click erase.\n\n*Select MS-DOS (FAT) for the Format.\n(If your drive is above 32GB, you might need to select ExFAT instead.)\n\n*Select Master Boot Record for the Scheme.\n(This is the one used for Windows partitions.)\n\n*Click erase.\n\n\n\n*Open Terminal and run command: diskutil list\nFrom the output, find out the name of the USB drive. It should be something like /dev/diskX. X is the number of the drive. For me, it's /dev/disk2. It might be different on your Mac.\n\n*Then type command: diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\nIt should print something like this: Unmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful.\n\n*Then type:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/win-iso-file of=/dev/disk2 bs=1m\n(This will ask for your Mac password. Enter it and hit return.)\n\n\n*\n\n*/path/to/win-iso-file is the full path of the ISO image. Just drag/drop it on terminal after if= and it will print the full path. \n\n\n*The process will start but there will be no output for a while. It might take 10 to 45 minutes. Be patient! (You can press Ctrl+T to see the bytes transferred so far.)\n\n*Once it's complete, it will output records in/out and bytes transferred. \n\n*Type: diskutil eject /dev/disk2\n\n*Now, re-plug the USB drive and check its contents. It should have files and folders but especially a setup.exe and an autorun.inf file.\n\n\n*Done.\n\n\nA: Have you tried using the cross-platform application called \"unetbootin\"?\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I've been using this method for the past year and a half, and it works quite well.

I'm going to have to trade in my work laptop and it's connected right now to my personal Apple account for things like the app store etc. How do I unlink the Apple account before I get a new computer?\n\nA: What to do before selling or giving away your Mac\nLearn how to back up and remove the data from your Mac before selling or giving the computer away.  \nWhen preparing to sell or give away your Mac, you may want to erase some or all files from its hard drive. But first determine whether you should back up your computer and disable certain features and services. These steps show the recommended sequence of actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deauthorize your computer from iTunes, if applicable.\n\n*Back up your data using Time Machine or other backup methods for OS X Yosemite, Mavericks or Mountain Lion.\n\n*If you use Find My Mac or other iCloud features on this Mac, complete these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your iCloud content.\n\n*Choose Apple Menu () > System Preferences, then click iCloud.\n\n*Deselect the Find My Mac checkbox.\n\n*Sign out of iCloud. When you sign out of iCloud, you're asked whether you want to remove iCloud data from your Mac. Removing iCloud data in this way makes sure that the data isn't also removed from any of your other devices that are using the same iCloud account.\n\n\n*If you're using OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 or later, sign out of iMessage:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Messages app, choose Preferences > Accounts.\n\n*Select your iMessage account, then click Sign Out.\n\n\n*Reformat your hard drive and reinstall OS X. Follow the appropriate instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite\n\n*OS X Mavericks\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion\n\n*OS X Lion\n\n\n*After you reformat your hard drive and reinstall OS X, the computer restarts to a Welcome screen and asks you to choose a country or region. If you want to leave the Mac in an out-of-box state, don't continue with the setup of your system. Instead, press Command-Q to shut down the Mac. When the new owner turns on the Mac, the Setup Assistant will guide them through the setup process.\n\nA: create a new user account  (system preferences users and group)\nmake the new user account an admin    (system preferences users and group) \nlogin with the new user account \nDelete your old user account    (system preferences users and group)\n", "Q: Do I have to replace the LCD if the iPad screen is cracked? I have an iPad 2 that my grandson dropped and the screen is now cracked around the edge, none of the cracks extend into the touch area of the screen.  All of the cracks are in the outside edge where the screen is black.  Do I have to repair the LCD or is that something that can be fixed without replacing the LCD?\n\nA: If the LCD screen is not damaged (no dead pixels) then you probably only need to replace the actual glass front touch panel, or digitizer, and do not need to change the LCD.  This can pick up relatively cheaply ($90, or eBay). You just prise the front panel off, and leaving the LCD in place, replace it with a new one.\nGoogle for this video \"How to: Fix a broken front panel on your iPad 2 or iPad 3\" on youtube.

I'm using the built-in SD card reader on a Macbook Pro (15\", late 2011) running Yosemite, and it treats every SD card as write-protected regardless of the position of the physical switch on the card.\nApparently this is a fairly common problem. I've already tried all the solutions given in this question, with no success. The only thing left that I can think of to try is making physical repairs to the drive. Since this problem is likely caused by a malfunctioning sensor for a setting I don't care about, that seems like overkill if there is a way to do it in software.\nIs there any known way to tell the drive or the OS to ignore the write-protection setting and treat a protected SD card as writeable?\n\nA: No.  You cannot override the write protection status of an SD Card via software.\nThe read/write status is handled by the firmware of the SD card host controller not by the driver.  From Toshiba (manufacturer of these chips):\n\nContent protection can be realized by using the [controller] with\n  firmware.\n\n\nInside the SD card reader are a series of pins that get connected if the write protection is enabled.  This tells the controller that write protection is enabled (Picture is not of the MacBook connectors, but the best one to illustrate how it works I could find online).\n\nIt is most likely that these pins are \"stuck\" together causing the controller to \"see\" the card as protected.  You can attempt to clean it out or as a better alternative, just purchase an inexpensive USB SD Card Reader.\n\nA: I have sacrificed a micro SD to SD adapter in order to see that there is no wire or lever going from the slider to the micro SD card, hence the protection it NOT in the card but in the reader.\n\nYet it could be possible to overcome the lock with proper software (kind of spoofing or masquerading).\nI happen to have a true full size no adapter Sandisk Extreme SD card that cost me more than 60 euros (I won't open it for curiosity).  It is almost always read only on my Macs (with either Mac OS or Linux).\nJust like it used to be with floppies: cover the hole!\nLet me do it.  Cover the hole with brown postal packaging tape (opaque and thin), being careful not to cover any electrical pin.\n\nNow my SD card is almost always writable, even if the slider is in lock position, which proves that it does not know the slider position and does not have built-in lock.\nAfter many years and many cards thrown to the bin for nothing...\n", "Q: What is the best way to transfer a large number of files between an iMac and a Macbook Pro?

Or is there a setting I do not have enabled which is causing the TP-LINK box to not recognise the MacBook ethernet connection when it is plugged in?\nMany thanks\n\nA: The issue may be the order in which your Mac is looking to connect to a network. You network preference pane should list options like these for connecting to networks:\n\nFirst check what the status is for your ethernet connection. Mine says \"Cable Unplugged\" because it is. If your says it is plugged in, but your connectivity is still via Wi-Fi, click the gear icon below that list and select \"Set Service Order\":\n\nYou'll then get a list like that allows you to reorder your network connections:\n\nSimply drag \"ethernet\" to the top and that should solve your problem.\n", "Q: Reduce Transparency Keeps Turning Itself Off In the accessibility settings on Yosemite I have enabled the \"Reduce Transparency\" setting multiple times.

Each time I turn it on and go back in and check it has turned itself off.\n\nIt seems to turn itself off if the external monitor is connected.\nWhy does this setting not work?\n\nA: The symptoms you describe are likely caused by the preference not getting saved to disk. This is caused by a problem with the file permissions, or if the preference file somehow got corrupted.\nIf this is the case, you can move the preference file (I think the relevant one is ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist) from its location: this will cause the preference file to be recreated.\nOf course this will work also for other preferences (though identifying the correct file isn't always as easy); remember to keep the file around (instead of deleting it) so you can restore it in case this fix doesn't work.\n", "Q: How do I remove a directory that has a file with colon in it I am trying to delete a directory with rm -rf however I keep getting the error Directory not empty.\nIf I do an ls on the directory I see this message ls: HTML : CSS: No such file or directory.\nSo it sounds like there's a file or directory that has a colon in it.

Please help :(\n\nA: This is the generally first aid when a device gets wet.\n\n\n*\n\n*TURN IT OFF as fast as possible. Don't even think about turning it on again till you are very sure it is dry. Don't try charging or plugging it in. Water and power do not mix well. \n\n*While leaving it off and unplugged, stick it in a bag container with dry rice. Rice ascorbs moisture, and if there is any chance your device is not already broken beyond repair then it needs to be completely dry before any attempt is made to turn it on again. \n\n*leave it in the rice for a week or so. \n\n*Remove it from the rice, turn it back on and hope for the best.

I can't keep them all on my computer because I don't have enough space.\nMost systems I've looked at can backup both the computer and the external drive. But when I move photos to the drive they will be removed from the computer backup and re-uploaded to the drive backup. This is not only a waste of bandwidth in re-uploading but I'll have to leave the drive plugged in until they are done uploading again. There could even be a time when they are not backed up - after they are 'deleted' from the original location and before they are uploaded again from the drive.\nCan anyone suggest a system that handles this or a better way for me to manage my photos?\nMy photos are all in Lightroom, there are about 500gb so far, I guess I'm adding a few gb per week.\n\nA: I'm not sure there is a way to do this exactly how you wish it, but perhaps some things to consider…\nI'm not sure Backblaze or anything similar is capable of 'knowing' that files moved to a different drive are still the same files - however, the remote servers will hang onto the old copies for 30 days after they are last seen, which should be plenty of time for the new copies to make their way to the backup.\nFrom personal experience, Backblaze shifts around 20 - 25GB of data every day from my machine, so a few GB of photos every month wouldn't be much overhead on that.\nOne thing I do, as belt & braces, is I have a local Time Machine backup too, to cover for most disaster recovery scenarios, short of the house burning down.\nOne other thing to consider is that the initial backup may take quite some time - mine took 3 months running 24/7 on a 12Mb UL line! (My total off-site storage at Backblaze is around 2TB.)\nDuring that time you are not completely covered, which makes the Time Machine even more important.\n\nA: I suggest that Crashplan could suit your needs for online backup.\nCrashplan does block level deduplication.\nMy suggestion for backup procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure Crashplan to backup both the internal drive and the external drive (maybe restricting it to just the folders with photos).\n\n*Make sure that Crashplan has completed its backup of your internal\ndrive. \n\n*Copy photos to external drive - but don't delete them yet.\n\n*Force Crashplan to backup the external drive (or just wait for it to\n    happen).  This should be relatively quick as Crashplan knows that it\n    already has the data.\n\n*Delete photos from your internal drive.\n\n\nAlso Crashplan will retain the backup of deleted files (assuming you configure it to keep them).\nAnd, of course, have an on-site backup to another external drive.  TimeMachine for the internal drive and a copy procedure for the photo external drive.\n", "Q: Using Applescript to fool key logger with keystrokes I don't know much about how Mac processes keystrokes, but if I wrote a simple AppleScript that opened a TextEdit document and started typing a huge block of text, would this effectively mask my typing if it ran in the background?\nOr does Mac process the AppleScript keystroke input first then whatever I'm typing second?\n\nA: Well, it might kind of work, but idk if it would do what you want to achieve.\nThis script \ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    activate\n    make new document\n    delay 1\n    repeat 100 times\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n            keystroke return\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nwill start typing into whichever document is frontmost when it starts after the 1s delay time for TextEdit to come to the front.\nOnce it's typing, you can switch to another app & continue what you were doing - but you can't use TextEdit as it won't let any other document come to the front until it's finished.\nIf you switch to another app before it starts typing, it will type into that instead.\nWhether that would fool a key logger, I have no clue - but that begs the question…\nwhat makes you think you have a key logger & why not get rid of it instead?  \nIf it's some kind of 'corporate' checkup on employees, consider how long it might take before they noticed it & wondered why you felt it necessary to try to bypass - something presumably covered in a contract of employment.\n\nA: Using a test KeyDownEvent app.\nThe keystrokes are registered from an applescript keystroke event.\nBut I do not think you will be able to use this as a mask.\nThe Applescript keystrokes will always insert the characters in the active app.\nTherefore typing in the area you are manually trying to type.\nSo if you had a block of text like :\n\n\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n\nin an applescript keystroke and ran it after a delay of 2 seconds\nAnd then tried to type \"bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\"\nYou would get: \"bbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\"\nThis also registers like this in the logger.

I realize that deleting and replacing the user account entirely would resolve the issue, but I would like to learn what is happening and how to resolve it directly.\n\nA: First, make sure the user is the owner of their home directory.  In Terminal, sudo ls -lFad /Users/(username) and that the permissions are set at least \"rwx\" for the owner.  Likewise, for the /Users/(username)/Library/ folder.\nThere are temporary cache files in /var/folders/(two letters)/(more characters)/ for each user.  You can find the specific one for your user by doing sudo ls -lFad /var/folders/*/* and searching for the one which is owned by the user.  Moving this entire directory someplace else (like, /Users/Shared/temporary/) may allow the user to log in successfully; but, I doubt it.  A cache corruption should be fixed automatically.  But, in the interest of completeness, I'll list it here anyway.\nThere are some files in the user's Library/ folder which (if corrupted) might cause the login to hang.  This list is arbitrary and not guaranteed to be complete, but it is a list of the most likely suspects.  You could move these (or, even, all of the preference files) and systematically replace them to see what is causing the hangup, assuming the login works when the files are moved away.\nFiles in ~/Library/Preferences/\n.GlobalPreferences.plist\ncom.apple.BezelServices.plist\ncom.apple.dock.plist\ncom.apple.dock.db\ncom.apple.finder.plist\ncom.apple.loginwindow.plist\ncom.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plist\ncom.apple.systemuiserver.plist\nloginwindow.plist\n\nFiles in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/\n.GlobalPreferences.(long string).plist\ncom.apple.windowserver.(long string).plist\n\nFiles in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n(could be anything)\n\nFiles in ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n(could be anything)\n\nAgain, this may or may not solve your trouble; but, it is a good starting point.\n\nA: First thing I would try to do is to fix all permissions on / drive\ntry:\nsudo diskutil repairPermissions / \nand report if it helped. \n", "Q: how to connect apple TV without giving my mac address i got my Apple TV with me cause i live in hotel but the only way to connected to internet if i give them my mac address, therefore if i give my mac address to customer service wont they be able to access all my info? and my mobile when connected? or pictures and video.\n\nA: If you connect to a network, by any means, it knows your MAC.\nI assume they want this to only allow connection from known devices.\nThere is no risk (or at least no more than any other connection).

This happens everyday. anybody knows what's going on and how to avoid it? During that time I am sleeping and the phone is connected to the WiFi.\nSecondly I have noticed that when I lock my phone, it starts using cellular data instead of WiFi!!!\nI have iOS 8.\nTry checking your data usage history, as it seems like a known issue. A lot of people did complain but I can not find a solution to it.\n\nA: It could be something like this secret (well, not so secret any more) program as detailed in the Wall Street Journal:\n\nUpdated Nov. 13, 2014 8:22 p.m. ET\nWASHINGTON—The Justice Department is scooping up data from thousands\n  of mobile phones through devices deployed on airplanes that mimic\n  cellphone towers, a high-tech hunt for criminal suspects that is\n  snagging a large number of innocent Americans, according to people\n  familiar with the operations.\nThe U.S. Marshals Service program, which became fully functional\n  around 2007, operates Cessna aircraft from at least five\n  metropolitan-area airports, with a flying range covering most of the\n  U.S. population, according to people familiar with the program.\n\nI've noticed the same thing myself, and I hear light planes flying over my greater NYC area home in the early morning several times a week.

I have the onedrive app installed, I can see a way to listen to individual files, but what I want to do, is get all of them onto the phone so that I can listen to them as a playlist. How can I do this?\n\nA: Download Microsoft Groove from the iTunes Store.\n\nGroove brings you all the music you love, every way you want it.\nOneDrive\n  • Add your MP3s to OneDrive and play them wherever you go\n  • Download playlists, albums and songs from OneDrive to enjoy your favourites even when you're off the grid\n  • See at a glance what's available where (online, offline, both)  \nMusic Pass\n  • Discover new songs, albums and artists right from your iPhone\n  • Play ad-free music from one of the biggest music catalogues on the planet\n  • Add songs, albums and playlists to your Groove music collection and access them from your phone, Xbox, PC, tablet and the web\n  • Listen to radio stations based on your favourite artists\n\n\nA: You can do this. You have to use One Drive on your PC and also install iTunes on your PC. Then you simply import the songs from One Drine into iTunes. Then sync your iTunes play list with your iOS device. \n\nA: I know this is an old question, but have you tried the app CloudBeats? It will take a lot of memory if you have an extensive amount of music on the cloud as it creates a sub-list on the device. But this makes the music searchable, and making playlists is easy and a generalized shuffle is allowed for either the whole playlist of songs or by album/playlist. I use it myself and find it works well.\nThere is an ability to download and play offline but only through the dedicated player.\n", "Q: Can thief use locked MacBook Air? My MacBook air was stolen from my apartment a few days ago. I got the address on the find my iPhone app, but then it said that the MacBook was locked, requiring a code. I didn't lock my MacBook from find my iPhone, and when I spoke to the Apple store they told me that it was probably locked because of the thief entering the wrong password too many times. \nMy question is: can the thief still use my MacBook? Can they delete the HD when it's locked and when I have a password on it?\n\nA: If you set a firmware password (which isn't set by default) and you used FileVault to encrypt the disk (also not the default), then the thief probably can't do anything with it. Without the firmware password, they can boot from USB, repartition the drive and do a new clean OS X install. Without FileVault they can remove the drive and mount it elsewhere, and then access your data. I'm afraid that just locking the screen is not enough.\n\nA: You can get law enforcement. But it's a bit tricky for them. If the new owner has the MacBook but was not actually caught stealing it from you. Then they would not be considered a thief. Common examples of what thiefs usually do is sell the device immediately on the streets for a low cost. \nThis leaving the new owner with a stolen device they purchased but did not steal. The crime has to be caught in action. \n", "Q: How can I change print quality and print profile settings when using Airprint? I just got a new wireless printer and I love that it lets me print from any device on my wireless network, even my iPhone. There is, however, one feature that appears to be missing.\nWhen I print from my computer, I can select different print quality settings: \"Draft, Normal, Photo, Black & White\". I don't seem to be able to do this from my iPhone when using Airprint. I can only click \"print\", choose my printer, and the item gets printed at whatever settings Apple deems best at that moment.\nBut what if I want to lower the print quality to save on ink? Or print a photo in black and white? Is there any way to change those settings?\n\nA: According to Apple, AirPrint on iPhone is simplified application.\nIt only lets you choose the printer and the number of copies, but not print quality etc.. in other words it use the current Printer defaults.\nSo what can you do?\nLog in to the printer's set up page IP address that you need to know it first, but it is something like (192.168. xxx) and change it there.  However, this solution will affect all following documents until you change it again.\n\nA: With iOS 9 AirPrint now has the option to print Black & White.\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: Standard Apple answer - \"there's an app for that\"\nI have, no, had the same issue with a Canon printer. In the app store I did a search for 'Airprint' and found a long list of apps from several major manufactures.  Downloaded the Canon app and I can now control all the settings when I airprint to my printer.\n", "Q: Yosemite as ftp server I have many problems with my Mac OS X. The system is only reachable via SSH, but not with FTP and not with SMB.\nSo I tried to concentrate on FTP, seems easier to debug and may be it's one problem for both services.\nFirst I enabled ftpd with:\nsudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\nThen I try to ftp.

So I think the ftpd is configured properly. But I also controlled the ftp.plist with a new installation.\nThe same content.\nSo is there anybody out there who has any further suggestions how to isolate the problem or how to solve it?\n\nA: Have you checked that it listening on the correct network interface? If connecting to localhost:21 works, but connecting to your LAN IP does not, it's likely just a misconfiguration. You can confirm with something like this:\n$ netstat -an | grep LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0  *.21                *.*                    LISTEN\n\nYou want to see *.21 or 0.0.0.0.21 or 192.168.0.x.21.\nIf you see ::1.21 or 127.0.0.1.21 then it's only listening on the localhost interface and won't be reachable from other systems.\nI couldn't reproduce your problem on my Yosemite system; when I ran ftpd with the arguments you provided, it correctly listened on all interfaces (*.21).\n", "Q: Move all contents from a folder to another with shell script Why does this work?   \nmv /Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Youtube/Novas/* /Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Youtube/Tratadas  \n\n…but the commands below don't work? \nmv \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Youtube/Novas/*\" \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Youtube/Tratadas\"\n\nI had to rename the folder \"Youtube\" from \"Youtube - Downloads\", just because this don't work:\nmv \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads - Youtube/Novas/*\" \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads - Youtube/Tratadas\"\n\nI want integrate this in an Automator app. Is there a better way to move all contents from an folder to another with Automator.app?\n\nA: The space character is used by bash to separate different parameters to a command so you need to protect/escape it if it occurs in filenames (or other parameters):\nmv /Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads\\ -\\ Youtube/Novas/*  /Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads\\ -\\ Youtube/Tratadas\n\nYou can also use quotes to protect the space characters from being misinterpreted by the shell but need to move the * outside the quotes then to allow wildcard expansion:\nmv \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads - Youtube/Novas/\"* \"/Users/diogosaraiva/Music/Downloads - Youtube/Tratadas\"\n\n", "Q: AppleScript referencing tabs suddently breaking on Chrome I've been successfully using a script for a long time, which uses Chrome to calculate execute some javascript and return the result.\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    tell window 1\n        tell tab 1\n            [do something here]\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nToday, after many months, I tried editing the script but the AppleScript Editor is refusing to save it (even without any changes, e.g. after typing a space and then deleting it...), showing an error message:\nSyntax Error\nExpected end of line but found number.\n\nwhile highlighting the 1 of tab 1 as being the offender...\nWhat is wrong with the latest version of the applescript editor or of Chrome?

However, both volumes were lost, and will need to be recreated from my backup.\nWhat I want to know in advance is whether it is possible to restore the user accounts to the new users volume using the Migration Assistant, or will it try to restore them onto the system volume? If the latter, is there another way I can seamlessly restore the user accounts?\nI've restored files using other means in the past, but that was a long manual process targeting specific things, and usually as part of a clean install for a new OS version, to avoid restoring leftovers etc. However this time I'm restoring due to hardware failure, so I'm not changing the OS, and I'm hoping to restore as much as possible as-is, albeit in stages (as some user accounts are very large, probably needing to be left overnight).\nBasically I want to be able to setup my replacement hardware, restore the OS, apps and admin on one volume, and restore the other users one at a time, such that each can just log-in like nothing happened.\n\nA: Okay so I went ahead with the update anyway and it turns out that Migration Assistant is clever enough to recognise relocated user accounts.\nIn my particular case it recognised them, but provided no option to restore their contents (just the account itself), possibly because my users volume hadn't been recreated at this point.\nHowever, after restoration was complete, and I'd recreated my users volume, all I needed to do was pop into Time Machine and restore the user folders from there, with the added advantage of the system still being usable throughout via my admin account.\nFor anyone in a similar situation, here are the basic steps that I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall OS X as normal, at the restoring content stage select to restore from Time Machine, and restore as much as little as you like. Relocated user accounts at this point show up as 19kb with a note that they were relocated; select them to restore the accounts. You'll need at least one account on the system volume to login, so if you don't have any to restore then I recommend creating an administrator account; this has the added benefit that you can downgrade your other users to standard for security.\n\n*Disable Time Machine in System Preferences to prevent a premature backup.\n\n*Once you're happy the basic OS is set-up (updates applied etc.) you can now recreate the user-accounts volume. Make sure that Time Machine is disabled throughout.\n\n*Now locate your computer's old backup folder; do this by opening your backup volume in the Finder and opening Backups.backupdb, and it'll be one of the folders inside (usually just one for a single-machine backup drive).\n\n*If Time Machine didn't ask to inherit your backup drive, you'll want to make sure you inherit it manually (or it might see all files as new). To do this, open Terminal and enter sudo tmutil inheritbackup now take your machine's old backup folder and drag it onto the Terminal window to add its path. Your command should look like: sudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Haravikk\\'s\\ Mac, you'll be asked for your password to run the command (must be run by an administrator).\n\n*Next you'll want to make sure you've associated the new volumes with their backed up counterparts (since newly created volumes will have a new unique ID). To do this open your machine's backup folder, and inside it open up the folder named \"Latest\", here you should see an entry for each volume that Time Machine was backing up. In Terminal, enter the following command: sudo tmutil associatedisk and drag the appropriate folder onto the Terminal window, then drag the corresponding volume on as well, your command will look like: sudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Haravikk\\'s\\ Mac/Latest/Users /Volumes/Users, hit enter to run the command.\n\n*Now when you open up your Users volume in the Finder, you can use Enter Time Machine from the Time Machine menu and use it to go back to see your old user folders, simply select each one you want and click Restore. You can do this several time if (like me) some user accounts are bigger than others.\n\n\nOnce you've restored all the user accounts, you should be safe to re-enable Time Machine backups, and the accounts should now work just as they did before (though some passwords may need to be re-entered).\n", "Q: Battery of my Mac with Problems When I charge my MacBook the battery goes only up to 99% and doesn't reach 100%.

The easiest way to do this is using a Linux Live CD. This allows you to start a totally separate, different and self-sufficient operating system. If you can get sound through that, it means the problem lies within your Mac OS X setup.\nYou can download a disk image here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nIf you can't or do not want to burn a CD or DVD, you can also make a USB drive. This can be automatically done using UnetBootIn (see: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net ). You will need a fairly big USB drive and it will be formatted so make sure you have no files on it you want to keep.\nI am suggesting Linux here because we also need to rule out a OS X-specific problem. Of some sort of EFI, HDA or OS X IOReg communication or matching failure causes CoreAudio not to load or to function properly, reinstalling OS X or booting form an external OS X drive might not help with further diagnostics.\n", "Q: App Store keeps asking for admin password I periodically get the following dialog box on my MacBook, running OS 10.9.5:\n\nApp Store is trying to install Apple-provided software.

I have turned off all automatic updates in System Preferences.\nThe problem is that I have no idea what this software is--I don't see any such updates in the App store when I open it.  My administrator account is distinct from my user account (which doesn't have admin privileges).  I can't disable this popup.  It drives me nuts (and I think it's a poor design choice by Apple that this dialog doesn't provide information about what it wants to do, and then expects me to type in an admin password and trust it).  If I press \"Cancel,\" the box goes away until it pops up later -- when, I don't know.  If I press \"Install Software,\" it again provides zero feedback.\nLooked at my console log too.

However, interacting with a phone system on the other end seems to be where her assistance hits a hard stop -- I can't find a way to have Siri \"press 1\" or anything to that effect during a phone call.\nWhile some phone systems accept voice input, many still rely upon DTMF tones to be sent through during the call to select certain menu items.

Sometimes it behaves as though I'm holding down a click. For example when working with a text editor I move the mouse across the page and the editor selects the text I move across (without me clicking). \nSometimes it's not possible to click even right at the bottom of the track pad - it feels the same when you try to click right a the top of the track pad (i.e. there is no movement and no 'click' sound).\nI've got Apple Care, but the error comes and goes so when I took it into the local repair centre they said they couldn't find anything wrong with it. (It's an apple authorised repairs rather than an actual apple store).\nAny suggestions what I can do? What might be causing this? How I can reproduce the fault for the repair guys?\n\nA: It sounds like your track-pad might need to be adjusted. If it's too tight it can cause the \"symptoms\" you are describing. I would say this is most likely, but it's always possible that there is another issue with it. If this happens to be the problem it is an easy fix, really. Or, at least it should be. I would take it to your authorized Apple Care repair shop and just have them open it up really quick and take a look. \nYou can do it yourself without much difficulty at all. Just keep in mind that if you open it up yourself that it voids your warranty. If you are OK with that, then go ahead and check out the solution below.\nYou need three screwdrivers to get in there and fix it: a tri wing screwdriver(same as the one for nintendo), a Phillips #00 screwdriver, and a T6 Torx Screwdriver. The screws holding the back cover on are tiny phillips screws, the battery is held in by tri wing screws, and to adjust the track pad you will need the T6 Torx driver. NintendoScrewdriver.com has a nice little screwdriver set that has a precision tri wing and phillips screwdriver in it (find that here: nintendoscrewdriver.com). It's technically for Nintendo stuff, but it's high quality and you can't go wrong with it. You can find the T6 torx driver here (also good quality, so you don't strip screws and so it actually fits!). \nYou really just need to take out the battery to get to the track pad. This video does an awesome job showing very clearly how to do this: (www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQZ_rG9VpHk). The parts you need are the first 0:00-1:45 (shows how to take out the cover and battery) and 13:40 shows taking out the track pad. You won't need to take the track pad out unless you are going to replace it. Also, this video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdKwE9FOnrI)does an AWESOME job describing how to adjust the track-pad. The macbook in that video is a 2008, but it should be the same on the 2012 model. I would also try cleaning it out with compressed air after opening it up.\nAnother possibility is that the battery is swelling. This is actually somewhat common. You can read about that here: discussions.apple.com/thread/4652016\nIf worst comes to worst, replacing the track pad isn't too bad. But, rounding back to the beginning, try to use that AppleCare to resolve the issue first so you don't void the warranty.\nHope this helps!\nNote: you will have to copy and paste some of the links. This is a new profile and it won't let me post more than 2 links until I have over 10 reputation points. \n\nA: If you've got AppleCare go to your authorised repair facility and ask to have the trackpad height properly checked and adjusted, or you can try it yourself as it's not a difficult job. You'll need to remove the rear cover and the battery (tri-wing screwdriver needed for the two battery screws) to gain access to the trackpad. Once you've done that you will see the adjustment screw. Adjust the height as necessary to obtain a reliable click action.\n", "Q: App adds itself to Login Items each time it starts How do I prevent an app from adding itself to the list of Login Items every time it starts?\nThe app in question is Unified Remote, which seems to completely wonderful apart from this \"bug\".\n\nA: Contact Unified Intents AB\nYour best option is to contact the developers of Unifed Remote directly.

To my frustration, it would not mount and I think the hardware may be defective.\nSometimes, I get it to mount and the drive will stay visible on the desktop. At other times, the LED on the drive will briefly flash but nothing would appear.\nHow can I get my Mac to recognize this new hard drive?\n\nA: The answer is, make sure that your SSD has adequate power.\nSome USB cables come with two USB plugs at one end.\nThe second and thinner part of the cable is needed for power supply.\nSo plug in both ends one in each USB port of the computer and then it should supply enough power.\nAlternatively, and this made for a more reliable power supply, one can use any USB device that supplies power. In this case an iPhone charger attached to the second USB end (power-only) did the trick.\n", "Q: Create a line separation for finder in the dock?

Then drag and drop the separator to the dock. You can find lots of assets for docks online at sites like deviantart or the old macthemes.net (if that still exists...)\nStill, the easiest way is to probably just use the defaults write command to get those invisble spacers.

So it seems it should work. \n\nA: Quoting Quora user Julio Cesar Sanchez Hernandez:\n\nThe only free way I’ve found is using watoi:\nIt requires a mac with Xcode and iTunes, and the unencrypted\n  msgstore.db with the Whatsapp conversations from Android (you can get\n  it using WhatsApp Key/DB Extractor)\nWon’t give much more details as the watoi project link has a README\n  with the instructions and are easy to follow\n\nWatoi has two limitations though, per its github page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media files and shared locations are not imported (got placeholders\ninstead)\n\n*Messages from contacts that changed ids (phone numbers) are\nnot linked\n\n\nA: It is not possible to transfer WhatsApp chats from Android to iPhone/iOS without paying for a third-party utility. I recently switched from Android to iPhone 11, and I tried almost every single application available on the internet (free ones are non-existent) that claims to transfer WhatsApp chats from Android to iPhone. I also tried an open-source software Watoi (WhatsApp Android to iOS Importer), but that didn't work for me either. \nI finally bought the desktop application recommended here, and it did transfer my WhatsApp messages as well as media from Android to my new iPhone. Trial version is free to download and it can transfer 20 chats per contact, but you have to pay $19.95 for the full version. This is how the software works:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll first need to enable USB debugging on your Android and backup all the chats to your phone's storage or SD card. \n\n*Go to Google drive (drive.google.com), and login with your Google account. Go to Settings > Manage Apps and disconnect WhatsApp messenger from drive.\n\n*Connect Android device to computer transfer all the chats to a local database by clicking \"Backup Messages\" button.\n\n*Connect iPhone to your computer and encrypt the iPhone backup using iTunes. \n\n*Now, download the WhatsApp messenger on you iPhone and verify your phone number. You can remove the SIM card from your Android and insert it on your iPhone or you can receive the verification SMS on your Android. \n\n*Finally, connect the iPhone to your PC via Lightning cable, and click \"Transfer messages from database to iPhone\" button.\nThe whole process takes some time, but it works. \n\nA: It is possible, but you need a paid software for this.\nI used Android WhatsApp to iPhone Transfer from Backuptrans and it works. It costs about 25 EUR for three devices.\nRequirement: Both devices needs to be connected to the PC and they should trust each other.\nHere is a rough step-by-step guide to demonstrate, how it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable USB-Debugging on Android Device\n\n*Make local backup within Whatsapp (Google Drive backup disabled and disconnected)\n\n*Start the software on the PC. An app (Backuptrans WA Sync Version: 3.1.21) will be started on the Android device (you need all device specific USB drivers)\n\n*You have to uninstall Whatsapp on Android. Then the software will install a modified version of Whatsapp\n\n*Software on the PC syncs with the Android device and extracts the local backup you made before and store is it on the PC (takes some time)\n\n*On iPhone you have to disable find my iphone, disable passcode and disable iCloud backup. Then you have to install iTunes\n\n*You have to install Whatsapp on iOS and activate it without choosing a backup (fresh install)\n\n*Make a sync of your iPhone with iTunes (so that Whatsapp is in the backup) and the backup must be encrypted\n\n*The software will then show your Android and iOS device. Either right click on Android device and choose \"Transfer Messages from Android to iPhone\" or use the relevant icon button at the top\n\n*The software then modifies the iTunes backup and restores with it your iPhone (takes time)\n\n*iPhone restarts and the restore is complete. You have to enter SIM PIN, device PIN and Apple ID again\n\n*Activate Whatsapp on iPhone again and have fun\n\n\nThe software itself is not user friendly and many popups come again and again until it works. There are also some instructions here or here available on the website. You can also find a video from someone on Youtube (in German) to see how it looks and works.\n\nA: From the WhatsApp FAQ it looks like it is unfortunately not possible.\nAlso there is info on the website saying:\n\nYour WhatsApp messages are automatically backed up and saved on your phone's memory daily.\n\nSo that must mean that it is saved in the application sandbox on iOS - therefore there would have to be an in-app mechanism to import the data, which seems to be lacking as the only feature close to this matter is Archive All Conversations - one way only.\nEDIT:\nThe previous FAQ link expired, but the information still holds on a new FAQ page:\n\nMove to a different type of phone\n...\nYou can’t transfer your chat history\n\n", "Q: Connecting to Mac Mini via SSH unreliable More often than not I am getting this error when connecting to a brand new Mac Mini, firewall disabled:\nssh -l [username] [fixed_ip]\nssh: connect to host [fixed_ip] port 22: Connection timed out\nssh -l [username] [fixed_ip]\nssh: connect to host [fixed_ip] port 22: No route to host\n\n(For security reasons, I have [fixed_ip] and [username] instead of the real values above.)\nThe connection does work sometimes, though.

Go to the root file system, then open the directory \"Application Archives\" then delete all of the ipa files. \nAnother alternative (without ads) is  iMazing  it does an amazing job with my files. (It's a paid app)\n\nA: Troubleshooting this is going to be difficult due to the way the storage tiers are arranged. Each app stores various caches, downloaded assets and items that are stored to the filesystem and iOS sends various storage pressure messages to apps so that they can clean up.\nIn your case, the apps aren't releasing enough storage and the OS is going in and cleaning house.\nIf you have a Mac, you can connect the device over USB and view the log files. Ask how to do that and link here and I'll provide that as an answer.\nAssuming you only want to use iOS - I would do several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Watch the storage data reported in the Settings app - perhaps saving screen images to document the state over time.\n\n*Sign out of iCloud - that can put a lot of storage out of \"view\" of the settings app. Mail downloads also use space that isn't \"accounted for\" so you could sign out of all Mail accounts temporarily while you try to isolate what program/programs are storage hungry.\n\n*Try and keep track of which apps you run. Turning off background refresh is a good start to controlling which apps are run, but Apple Watch, extensions (say when dropbox appears in another app) mean that you can get code running from an app even when you don't launch it explicitly from the springboard/siri/spotlight.\n\n\nSadly, your \"reinstalling apps\" and watching them one by one is the best way to sort this out if you don't want to enroll a computer to measure things and watch the log file for messages that might give you a clue to storage space warnings.\n\nA: Have you updated your iPhone to latest iOS version? Have you installed the app \"WhatsApp\"? Seems it was the app \"WhatsApp\", creating lots of cache files and stealing storage from the phone. You can try to install the update and see whether the storage came back to a normal level. You can also use iMyfone Umate to clean up iPhone space, it supports large file deletion. \n\nA: I just turned off the family sharing and iCloud and gained back 3 GB of space.\n", "Q: Missing toolbar for New Message window in Mail.app I no longer have the toolbar at the top of New Message (The one with buttons for Send, Add Attachments..). It is only missing in New Message, if I for example reply to a message, the toolbar is correct.\n\nI can still send the message by selecting Message -> Send in the menu bar. \nI have tried going to View -> Customize Toolbar, but it doesn't display any options. \n\nI'm out of ideas.

I've researched but am still unclear whether NVIDIA GTX660 or Zotac GeForce GTX 760 will just slot into my Mac Pro 2009 without buggering about with power supplies etc.\n\nA: The GTX 760 has two connectors to provide it power.  You will need two adapter cables to go from the Macs 6 pin to the video card 6 pin, as they are different sizes.  Here is a link to one on Amazon.\n\nThe 660GTX only has a single power connector, so you will just need one if you went that route.  \nHere is a video showing the installation of a GTX 660.\nYou may want to also consider leaving in the original video card so that you will have the ability to see the screen during boot, or when booting holding Option to select the boot disc.  I installed my original card in the top slot, and have it connected to my monitor via VGA and my upgraded card connected via DVI.  That way I can fairly easily switch between them.  It is not required to do this, but may help you down the road.\n", "Q: 2014 MacBook Pro Retina Failed Boot Camp Install, Loading Screens During Boot My girlfriend has a 2014 MacBook Pro Retina that we tried to install Windows 7 on through BootCamp. The install failed (I don't remember how... It actually got partway through the install), and since then it looks like there are loading screens (Similar to the \"Windows is loading...\" screen on the windows 7 install media, before you see the blue background with the installer) during boot.\nWe have disabled bootcamp and removed the space set aside for windows with the OS X disk manager. Does anyone know what this is, and how we can stop it happening?\n\nA: Based on the information you gave I can't really guess why, but your Windows install failed.\nI would suggest you try again, making sure you carefully follow the instructions in Apple's Boot Camp manual step by step.\nBe sure to back up your data before doing so.\n", "Q: IOS 7 - Google Calendar - Fantastical edit mode shows GMT timezone I have an iphone-5, ios-7.  I use fantastical 2 to manage multiple google calendars.  When I create an event the event is created in my LOCAL time-zone (pst).  When I view the event the event is displayed in my LOCAL timezone.  However, when I want to edit the event, the time shows up in GMT...\nOriginally Time Zone Support was turned off.\nThen I turned it on, and the Time Zone shows correctly (Vancouver).  However, when I go to edit an event it still shows as GMT.\nCould you please help me with this...I don't think I can continue to use the software as is...\nPlease note that I'm NOT on ios-8, I'm on version 7.1.2.\n\nA: GMT, also called UTC or Zulu time.\nIs the basis time (zero) for all time zones clocks world wide.\nWhen the Time Zone Support is turned on, the Calender will rightly so show the GMT for you to decide which time zone is to be used. \nIt has to do that logically, since you are on time zone support (means automatic switching the time zone) if you travel. So you have to tell it which time zone to use as fix point for that event.\nLet me try to make it clearer:\nYou set a meeting for the Vancouver time at 8:00.\nNow you travel to New York and the Calender will automatically move that time to New York time, if the time zone support is turned on, if it is not turned on you would miss that meeting reminder, since it will still show as Vancouver time.\nYou can either leave it on, and choose the time zone, or turn off the time zone support. If you do not travel outside your PST time zone you do not need the time zone support.\nBut...there is always a \"but\".\nIf you have meeting attendees from different time zones, and not always up to speed of the time differences, calling a meeting at 16:00 Vancouver time with someone in NY would mean 19:00 for them. Here is where the time zone support comes handy for you to look up.\nIn your Fantastical 2 you can turn it on/off here:\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"restore backup\" and \"restore iPhone\" in iTunes? Connect the iPhone to the computer, click on the device in iTunes, and under Summary there are two buttons as described in the question.\nWhat is the difference in terms of what is actually restored?\n\nA: Restore Backup restores the contents of an iPhone backup performed sometime in the past. It restores content and stored data such as app settings, home-screen layouts, etc. Saved account login information is restored if the backup was encrypted.\nRestore iPhone wipes the iPhone of all data & apps and reinstalls iOS, leaving the iPhone reset to factory settings. The iPhone is left with just the latest iOS and the Apple default apps.\nFind My iPhone must be turned off for either to work.\n\nA: The restore back up is just restoring your data from when it was backed up.\nWarning:\nRestoring iPhone will restore all, including the operating system and leave it as it came out of the box. You will lose your settings and data, but you can get those from restore back up.\n\nA: Restore backup mean that you restore your iPhone from an iTunes backup, or the backup you made by other iPhone backup tools before. After restore, all the data in the backup will replace the current data on your iPhone. \nRestore iPhone is like erasing all the content and settings on your iPhone which you can do it by going to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings on your iPhone. It will wipe all the data on your iPhone. \nNote that no matter you restore iPhone from backup or restore it directly by iTunes, all the data which is currently on your iPhone will be removed and no way to recover it. \nSo back up your iPhone before you do this.\n\nA: This same thing happened to me. I restored my phone and the. Jail role again. That time the jailbreak didn't complete(there was a blue screen at the end of jailbreak) After that for the third time I jail broke and this time it worked. Now I can use jailbreak freely. I hope that helped. Have a good day \n", "Q: Recently scrolling up and down gesture triggers page change gesture Recently my mid 2012 Retina Macbook Pro's trackpad has started exhibiting some strange behavior. Attempting to scroll up or down using the two finger gesture randomly seems to trigger the page back/page forward gesture.\nI've tried rotating my macbook slightly to correct for any slight variation in my finger positioning, however that doesn't seem to help.\nI don't know the exact point where this began happening, but I'm sure it wasn't like this a year ago. I'm currently running Yosemite, after upgrading from a clean install of Mavericks.\nEdit: This is primarily happening in Google Chrome. I will try other browsers but I suspect this is irrelevant.\n\nA: If this is happening in Preview: when your pointer is on the titlebar/toolbar, using the 2-finger scroll will trigger the page up page down gesture. Make sure your pointer is on the document itself and not the titlebar.\n", "Q: How to find and kill an installer that autostarts at boot time Asking on behalf of a child who doesn't remember if/when some application was updated and required a restart to complete the installation.\nOSX 10.8.5 , MacBook Pro.   Here's what happens:  when rebooting, a dialog window comes up with the \"package\" icon and asks \"Continue with Install?\"  and one must select either 'yes' or 'abort'.  \nIf 'yes' is selected, then a process owned by the user runs forever, incidentally consuming up a lot of RAM.  Whether 'yes' or 'abort' is selected, the same dialog comes up on the next reboot.  \nIn Activity Monitor, the process is just called \"Installer.\"\nThings we know were not initiated: any system upgrade. \nMy offspring vaguely remembers starting to update \"some app\" which was later deleted from the machine.  Assuming that's the case, this installer appears to be hung trying to get to files that don't exist.\nSo, in any case, is there some file I can delete that will stop the installer from starting up on reboot?  If there is something I can do to provide more info on what/where this Installer app is, let me know and I\"ll post it up.\n\nA: Besides the Login Items (Open the Users & Groups pane of System Preferences),\ntry this.\nIn Terminal, type \nls ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nYou will see your \"personal\" launch agents.\nTo see all the currently loaded agents, type this:\nlaunchctl list\n\nIf you can identify the one you don't want, use the unload option:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/whateverItIsYouWantToUnload\n\n\nA: My suggestion would be to run an application called Etrecheck and post the results either in your original question, or in a gist here and then update the question with a link to the gist. This could be a malware infection. The output from Etrecheck might help to confirm this. It is very suspicious to me that something is claiming to be an \"Installer\" but not telling you what it is installing.\nAlternatively you can use Activity Monitor to identify what is launching Installer. Within Activity Monitor select the Installer process, then click the Info button (or hit the ⌘ and I keys) to bring up the Inspector window for that process. If you click on \"Open Files and Ports\" tab it will tell you where Installer is running from. The first entry on the list should be the location of the actual executable file. So you could kill the process and then go to that location and delete or move the application to another location. Note that in the screenshot below /Users/alistair/Downloads/EtreCheck.app/Contents/MacOS/EtreCheck is the process but /Users/alistair/Downloads/EtreCheck.app is the application bundle you would find within Finder.  If you still aren't sure what the Installer is, giving us the full path to the executable in a comment might help us identify it if it is something malicious.\n\n\nA: Don't run the EtreCheck. It is almost certainly malware. What can be done to stop \"EtreCheck\" malware? \nTo add to the other person's answer checking your Launch Agents is a good idea but their recomendation would only check for launch agents started by the active user's user name and overlook those that are listed under the root user/by the system or any other user. Typing sudo will show you the System's launch agents and well for the rest of the random \"users\" you have you can try using \"sudo launchctl asusuer 502 launchctl list\" where 502 would be the UID of the another user. \"dscl -raw localhost -readall /Local/Default/Users\" will show you all the unique id's available. Activity Monitor will show you all of the other user names that currently have a process but to see all of the not loaded plists you'd need to use launchctl. \nKnow this is ancient history but wanted to mention those 2 items. \n", "Q: Removing a contact from a folder in Yosemite Contacts software I created a folder in the Yosemite Contacts program and added some people to it.

I don't get the dialog box above with the \"Remove from Groups\" option:\n\nIf I select the contact and use the Edit menu the \"Remove from Group\" item is greyed out:\n\n\nA: There's a Remove From Group Menu item.\nSelect Your contact in the Group and open Edit -> Remove From Group.\n\n\nA: By Folder I think you mean Group.\nWhen you hit the delete button or use the Menu. Contacts.app will give you a choice of deleting the Contact (card) from everywhere or just the Group.\nYou should choose the Remove from group. This will then only Remove it from the group and not delete it from the Contacts.\n\n\nA: It turns out that I was creating my groups within an Exchange account.

With my built-in iPhone keyboard that is easily possible, but I can't seem to find the setting on Swype.\n\nA: Yes, that's possible in Swype. And in SwiftKey, too, by the way. Let me walk you through how I did it. But let me tell you why first.\nFor Stack Exchange, I use:\n\n*\n\n*US English spelling, since we're on a US website. Though, as a European, I should advocate UK spelling. Then again, the UK doesn't seem to advocate being European.\n\n*A German keyboard layout, i.e. QWERTZ instead of QWERTY, because I've been using that layout for physical keyboards for the last couple of decades.\n\nWith the iPhone, it's easy to set those two differently. With third-party keyboards, not so much. But it is possible:\nSwype\nPreconditions: You have bought the app and performed basic configuration so that you can access Swype as a virtual keyboard in your apps.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Open any app that can access the Swype keyboard.\n\n*Select Swype as input method.\n\n*Press and hold the space bar, then slide up to More Languages.\n\n*Do not click on any language! Instead, for the language you want to configure, e.g. \"English\" (the US variant is implied), click on the right arrow >. It took me a while to discover this.\n\n*Choose the layout that you want, e.g. \"QWERTZ\" in my case. Voilà.\nSwiftKey\nPreconditions: You have downloaded the app and performed basic configuration so that you can access SwiftKey as a virtual keyboard in your apps.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Open the SwiftKey app.\n\n*Go to Languages. Under Downloaded Languages, you should see at least \"English (US)\" and \"QWERTY\"\n\n*Click on switch layout for a language.\n\n*Choose the layout that you want, e.g. \"QWERTZ\" in my case. Voilà.\n\nPS: I haven't quite made up my mind as to which of the two apps I actually prefer. I see immediate differences, but no killer criterion yet. I'll keep testing both for a while longer.\n\n\nA: You can't use two languages simultaneously, this is device wide, not specific to swype. However swype is bilingual and you can set the keyboard to any language they support by holding down the swype icon button and then selecting the settings icon and choose a language according to your needs.

When I upgraded to Yosemite, I happily used Notification Center to receive alerts upon getting a message or so. I then turned them off at some point and recently changed my password (not sure if that matters). Since then, despite the notification type being set to \"Alerts\" and having updated the password in Internet Accounts, I do not receive Notifications. I can use the notification center to post to Facebook, which makes it weirder.\nThe problem does not appear to be exclusive to me (see these discussions).

I know that many of the directories in /System/Library/ have analogues in /Library/, and a fewer several have analogues in ~/Library/ as well. I also know that in at least some cases, when the system is looking for something that may be rooted in one of these Library directories, it looks in the analogous locations as well.\nFor example, an application may install a file in /Library/Application Support/A/B/, but have been just as happy to have installed it in ~/Library/Application Support/A/B/, and though there may be records of the location of every file the application installed, the system may not refer to them when looking for a file. In other words, it knows that any time it checks for anything rooted in System/Library/, it needs to look in the corresponding locations in /Library/ and ~/Library/.\nIs that last statement really true? That in all cases, (or in almost all cases, with certain exceptions) when the computer looks in one of the three Library directories it looks in the other two as well? For example, can a user move something that was installed in /System/Libary/Extensions/ to an Extensions directory he creates in his home directory's Library/ and expect it to be loaded from there at login, the way that, say, a property list found in ~/Libary/LaunchAgents/ would have been found just as easily had it been located in /Libary/LaunchAgents/?\nSimilarly, I notice that some applications store frameworks, plugins, and so forth in directories rooted in those applications' bundles. Can files be moved between there and appropriately-named locations elsewhere without problem? In theory at least, is this the way the filesystem is designed to work?\n\nA: The answer to all your questions is No\nTo understand the file system you may like to start with File System Basics.\nThe three /Library locations are for different purposes though, as you have guessed, there is some overlap.\nBriefly, the purpose of each is:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library:  Files which allow OS X to start and run.\n\n*/Library:  Other important system and application support files which are not specific to each user.\n\n*~/Library:  System and application support files which are specific to the user.\n\n\nSo files in /Library/Application Support/x are used by all users of application x and those in ~/Library/Application Support/x are specific to the user.  Some applications will only use one or the other, whilst some use both.\nMoving folders/files between /Library and ~/Library is likely to cause applications to malfunction or system components to fail.  Moving LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons is especially dangerous. \nEven worse, touching /System/Library is likely to prevent your Mac from booting!\nAlso, files inside application bundles must remain where they are - moving them will break the application.\nSo, in conclusion, don't move folders around as OS X expects files to be in their right place.\n", "Q: How do I get someone else's apple ID off of the iphone 5 I purchased a used iphone and now I cannot transfer my information to it because it still has the former owner's Apple ID.\n\nA: This depends on the situation.\nIF Find My iPhone is on, he'll have to remove it from his account. Otherwise, sign out in iTunes & App Store, iCloud, FaceTime, Messages > Send & Receive, and GameCenter (can all be found in Settings, some may not be signed in). In most of these, you can tap on the AppleID: or Account: field, which shows the email address, while in iCloud, you scroll down to the bottom and look for Sign Out (iOS 8) or Delete Account (7 and earlier)\nIdeally, as long as Find My iPhone is not turned on, Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content And Settings, or even more ideally, use iTunes to Restore iPhone.\nIn summary, when Find My iPhone is NOT turned on, the best way is to use iTunes to restore.\nEdit: I just noticed you tagged your question ios-5. If it's not running iOS 7 or newer, you may not need to worry about Find My iPhone. Activation Lock begins with 7. (You can check the version in Settings > General > About if you're unsure.)\n\nA: Go to Settings > iTunes & App Store > click on the 'Apple ID: somename@gmail.com' > Sign Out\nSign out of iCloud : Settings > iCloud > Sign Out (at the very bottom)\nOr you can just restore to factory settings. \n", "Q: Why is Time Machine showing a \"Preparing disk for decryption\" progress bar? I had an existing USB drive which was already encrypted (at the file-system level) and then I opened Time Machine and also selected \"Encrypt backups\" when choosing the disk and now I have a very slow progress bar showing \"Preparing disk for decryption\". I can't cancel it. Why would it be decrypting anything?\n\nA: Time Machine prepares the drive for storing backups when you set it up. This means, disrupting filesystem-level encryption that wasn't made by Time Machine. If you want encryption on top of Time Machine encryption, it has to be below the filesystem level, or you'll surely lose it in favor of Time Machine. If you want encrypted Time Machine backups, simply enable encrypted backups when setting up Time Machine instead of encrypting in Disk Utility.\n\nA: This happens when someone turns on FileVault on an external volume.  Did you turn it on?  If so, and you don't want it, you can turn it off.\n", "Q: How To Open System Directories In Finder Without Opening A New Finder Tab In the finder I made hidden directories visible. The odd thing is that any system directory (IE one whose name starts with a \".\") I can't open them by double-clicking on them. Instead I have to right click and and select to open in a new tab. Is there a way to change this behavior?\nI'm using Mavericks, not sure if this issue is specific to Mavericks or not.\n\nA: You can enter those directories from keyboard with ⌘ CMD+↓ Down arrow.\n Or ⇧ SHIFT+⌘ CMD+G and type the name of the directory You want to enter. You can complete directory name with ⇥ TAB button (for example type Down in $USER dir, press ⇥ TAB and it will become Downloads).\n", "Q: Convert Mac Pro internal boot drive into an external harddrive without wiping I have a 2008 Mac Pro running Yosemite. I just purchased a solid state hard drive which I want to become my boot drive. I do not want to transfer the data from the original boot drive to the solid state drive; I just want to be able to access the data on it.\nIs there a way to move it to another slot and not have it run as a boot drive, so I may access the contents?\nand/or\nIs there a way to essentially turn it into an external hard drive, so I can easily access the contents?\nThank you\n\nA: You don't even need to move it to another slot. Install your SSD, set it up the way you want, then go to System Preferences -> Startup Disk and choose the SSD.\nThis isn't Windows, and it isn't 1993. You can have as many bootable volumes online as you have disk space for, Macs boot the one you want booted.\n", "Q: Is it theoretically possible for DirectX to work on OS X natively? As far as I can tell, DX as a software-component is tightly wound to Windows as for hardware-acceleration and is provided as a set of DLLs and a runtime system for applications that depend on it; however, OS X uses GPUs that support DX. The problem seems to not lie in the inability on the hardware side, but on the non-existent runtime on the software, and the inability for winding between applications and a DX runtime system.\nOS X uses OpenGL only for hardware-acceleration, so if my cards are right, isn't it possible to reverse engineer DX's COM interface and re-compile it back as an Objective-C interface with static or dynamic linkage and enable the runtime to work on OS X, along with re-writing device drivers to enable mapping to GPU address space to implement the features of DirectX operations on the GPU (shading, GPGPU, etc.)? I know it sounds crazy, but I can't find any way to believe this to be impossible. Most GPUs today support DirectX.\n\nA: It's more than theoretically possible, it's how many PC games are ported to run on OS X - using Cider from TransGaming.  This is from TransGaming's web site:\n\nCider works by directly loading a Windows program into memory on an\n  Intel Mac system and linking it to an optimized version of the Win32\n  APIs. TransGaming's Cider implements common multimedia Windows APIs\n  such as Direct3D, DirectInput, DirectSound and many others by mapping\n  them to Mac equivalents.\n\n\nA: It is theoretically possible, and also in theory, the implementation does not have to be written by Microsoft, but be functionally identical. It is currently not available in reality, but many solutions, such as Cider, can wrap it to OpenGL.\n", "Q: Apple store question about installing new hard drive I plan to make a trip up to the apple store tomorrow. I need them to put in a new hard drive in my Macbook Pro mid-2010 15\". Do I need to make an appointment with them? or can I just show up and drop it off with them?\nThanks\n\nA: The generally accepted procedure for any Genius Bar visit is to use the store locator on the Apple site and then use the 'Concierge' web application to book an appointment. While Apple staff (at least in Japan) tend to be rather accommodating for walk-in client issues, having an appointment can ensure your waiting time is minimized. This is especially important at a busier location.\n", "Q: Yosemite Updates From App Store Not Working I recently bought a new iMac and installed Yosemite on it, but for some reason whenever I try to update I just get this message:\n\"[Name of App] was purchased using the App Store on another computer. To use [Name of App] on this computer, sign in using the Apple ID and password used to purchase it.\"\nNope. My Apple ID remains the same as it was on my old iMac, and I don't remember ever having another one. If anybody knows how to sort this out, I'd be very grateful as I haven't been able to update anything in about three months.\n\nA: You may have an application which was left over from the previous owner.  The simple way to deal with that is to delete the old version and download the new version (with your own Apple ID) anew.\nFirst, in the Mac App Store, go to the Purchases tab and verify that the app you want to download is listed there for your Apple ID.\nNext, move (or, if you are brave, remove) the application from the /Applications/ folder to someplace like your Desktop.\nFinally, quit/restart the Mac App Store, go back to the Purchases tab, and re-download the application.\n", "Q: Is it possible to generate or update a recovery parition We have started to replace hard drives in some MacBook Pros and Airs that are about 3 years old.\nWe found out the hard way that FileVault encryption requires a recovery parition. \nIf we install Mountain Lion or Mavericks from the USB installers that we have created, we do not get the option to create the recovery partition.\nSo far, we have only found 2 methods:\n1) Internet Recovery - This takes a long time and usually installs Lion, which then requires an upgrade to Mavericks.  After upgrading to Mavericks, the recovery partition will reinstall Lion if the recovery partition is used to reinstall Mac OS X.\n2) Take it to the Apple Store - This is not always practical in a business environment.\nIs there any other way to do this?\n\nA: In my experience, there is never an \"option\" to create a Recovery Partition. I've done a number of clean installs from DiskMaker USBs and each of them automagically resulted in recovery partitions being created during the installation process. For me, the typical upgrade process is to either wipe the existing drive or install a new one, use a DiskMaker X-created USB to install the version of OS X desired and then import the required apps, data and user profiles from Time Machine.\nThis has worked flawlessly with Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks on a variety of systems.\nInternet Recovery always installs the version of OS X that was originally shipped with the product. Local Recovery will reinstall the OS X version that was used to create the recovery partition. A typical scenario would be to take a virgin disk installed in a system, boot to a Mavericks USB installer, use Disk Utility to create the install partition and then start the installation process. The OS X installer will resize the partition you created automagically and create the recovery partition. A reinstall from Local Recovery would feature Mavericks in this case.\nI understand that you're seeing something different, but I have yet to see an install with Lion or newer that was missing its Recovery Partition when the install was done on a wiped or new HDD. A system with a series of in-place upgrades will miss out on the Recovery Partition, e.g., Snow Leopard to Lion to Mountain Lion, but that does not appear to be the scenario you're discussing.\n", "Q: Turn off mail notification in terminal I'm running some cron jobs on my machine and every time I fire up a terminal session I'm getting a 'You have mail.' message. Any way to turn this off?\n\nA: It's likely to be in the spool file: /var/mail/$user. Because sometimes your mailbox will contain important messages (a failed cronjob task, etc.) you don't to check it every time by yourself.\nAlso, you can check man mail\n\nA: I think if you add this line to your ~/.bashrc file, the notifications will go away.\nunset MAILCHECK\n\n\nA: Mac OS X runs \"login\" each time a login occurs.  So, no matter what the setting is for Bash, the \"login\" will tell you about mail whenever you login.\nHowever, if you have a ~/.hushlogin file, the login process will be quieter and (hopefully) not bother you.\nApple's man page for \"login\"\n", "Q: Why can my iMac see my Macbook pro with 2 different icons on the network sharing? (as if it were 2 devices) I recently noticed that my iMac lists my macbook pro with 2 different icons (the normal laptop one and a generic pc one)\n\nI am worried this means i have a server running on the background or some other possible security issue.\nI disabled file sharing completely (SMB and AFP) and they both disappeared, but im still worried this might happen at some other time without my knowledge thus being a security issue.\n\nA: You answered it yourself. You had both AFP and SMB network sharing protocols enabled. Thus your mac was presented as two network devices. Notebook icon is for AFP shares and generic PC one is for SMB.\nNo need to worry about that since it is normal behaviour.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch parts between Verizon and AT&T iPhone 5? I have a water damaged iPhone 5 from Verizon that doesn't work. My cellular plan is also with Verizon. I just purchased an AT&T iPhone 5 from a friend, not knowing that Verizon and AT&T iPhones aren't compatible (beyond incredibly frustrating).\nI've opened up my water damaged iPhone and it seemed like the battery was screwed (air bubbles around the battery's lining), not necessarily any of the chips. Although I'm no expert and most of the chips have metal casings covering them. There was a small amount of a white-teal miss-coloration, probably from corrosion, around the battery's connectors but I cleaned that off with 100% isopropyl alcohol.\nCan I take the battery from the recently purchased AT&T iPhone 5 and put it in the Verizon iPhone 5? If not, can I take the CDMA+GSM Verizon chip and switch it with the GSM only AT&T chip? Can I take any working parts from the AT&T phone and try them in the Verizon phone, preferably without damaging said parts?\nI don't want my friend to give me my money back. He only wanted 20 dollars and I'd rather not insult his generosity. I just want to get one of these iPhones working.\n\nA: You can use the battery from the phone that is not from your provider, but not switch radios. Batteries between models, e.g., iPhone 5, are the same even when the radios are not. Even when radio types are the same, e.g., GSM vs GSM, the operating frequencies, etc., often aren't.\nOther pieces, such as screen glass, case, screen layers and the like are also interchangeable. Basically, it's the radio-oriented stuff that you can't swap.\n", "Q: Is it possible to include a shared calender from Exchange in the calendar app on Mac OS X? I am trying to add a shared Exchange calendar to my Mac Calendar app. The shared calendar shows up in the Outlook calendar, but how do I add it to the Mac Calendar?\n\nA: Here's the way that worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*With iCal open go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select iCal, it's to the right of the Apple Symbol in the upper left corner.\n\n*Select Preferences\n\n*Once the Preferences window comes up select the Accounts section then select the Exchange account to bring up its information.\n\n*Now select the Delegation tab.\n\n*Under the list is a + sign. Click this to add a calendar.\n\n*Begin typing the user's name as above and the auto-completion will begin. Once you've found the correct user's name select it to add it under the Users column.\n\n*Under Accounts I can access: you will now see that user's name. You can enable or disable their calendar from displaying by checking or unchecking the boxes under the Show header.\n\nI found these instructions from the USC website.\n\nA: I just had this problem and just figured it out.  \nHere are the steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Login to Outlook Web Access (the web interface for your Exchange Server).\n\n*Click on public folders (for me, it was all they way in the bottom left).  \n\n*The, navigate to the public folder of your choice (I needed a calendar).  \n\n*Right click on the public calendar and select copy from the context menu.\n\n*Navigate back to your own mailbox (I clicked \"mail\" in the lower left). \n\n*Right click on your own calendar and click paste (I added it to a new folder). \n\n*Then, return to calendar.app and refresh your calendars (View menu -> refresh or command R).  \n\n*After doing that, the public calendar popped up along side my other calendars.  \n\n\nHope it works as well for you as it just did for me!\nAlso, I think this question is a duplicate of this one. \n", "Q: Why 2 same files have different size on NTFS?

There is no such attribute on my file. What may be the difference between them?\nUPDATE: I didn't notice at first. Both files reside in NTFS filesystem which is accessed through Paragon NTFS driver v12.\n\nA: This is probably due to how Paragon driver handles native NTFS compression. If I understand their docs correctly, it can un-compress on-the-fly, but cannot actually write the file back in compressed state.  \nFrom their faq page:\n\n\n*How does the NTFS for Mac® driver handle compressed files?\nNTFS supports its own compression feature. It is impossible (without a special copy routine) to copy compressed files or directories “as is” - because after the reading step we get the uncompressed file or directory. However, if the destination folder is compressed (on an NTFS partition), then the file or folder will be compressed too.\n\n\nYou can confirm your suspicions from Windows, by using standard Windows tools:\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc976811.aspx\n(Unfortunately, I haven't found any tools that can confirm it from Paragon)\n\nA: First thing I'd try is telling Spotlight to reindex the file. Could be the metadata in Spotlight's index is just outdated (never seen this myself before, but you never know). Just run the following command to tell Spotlight to reindex the file.\nmdimport /path/to/src.mov\n\nYou can also run it with -d 1 up to -d 4 for varying amounts of debugging information as following.\nmdimport -d 1 /path/to/src.mov\n\nIf that doesn't make any difference, given the different file sizes and the fact that (according to your earlier question) Unison couldn't back up the file I'd suspect corruption in the filesystem.\nI believe Paragon adds the ability to Verify and Repair NTFS volumes within Disk Utility. You could try verifying and repairing the volume, then checking the original file to see if the size has been modified. If connecting this volume to a Windows machine is a possibility you could also try running CHKDSK against it.\n", "Q: Document editing on the ipad It is not clear to me how the file system in iOS 8 works. Consider e.g. the Dropbox app, when I open a document in another app, what happens?\nIt looks to me as:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy of the file is created\n\n*file handle to the copied file is passed to the other app\n\n*other app edits the file\n\n*other app keeps the file\n\n\nA few question regarding this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this how it works? \n\n*Where is the new file stored? \n\n*Does iCloud work the same way?\n\n\nThis seems rather messy, as I just want an app that can edit e.g. pdf documents IN Dropbox.\n\nA: Heres where things get a little tricky.\nDropbox isn't an app tailored to your needs. It wasn't designed to edit PDF's or files, although, it can view them and that functionality can one day exist, but it's intent as a business is to offer customers a place to store their documents that can be accesabile across all their devices. With Apple, and developing for them, you are constrained to your app and it's bundle of resources. So for example, Dropbox. Dropbox is a application stored on the device, that can only write and save files to the applications bundle (think folder for bundle) and no where else on the device, this is for numerous safety precautions implemented by Apple. Makes sense. The drawback, is that the Developers have to make the features available that you want, not Apple. If the Developers want you to be able to edit the PDF then they have to explicitly code for that feature, otherwise they can share with extensions a file/document to another app that already does that. Again, since Dropbox is in the business of storing files that would be their motive to not allow. Things can change, you can always submit a request, but it's not that easy developing things, it takes a lot of work and man-hours. \nSo to answer your questions :\n1 ) Yes - a copy is sent to the application you elect because, as stated before, an app can only directly effect the resources in it's bundle (app folder) on the device and no where else so Dropbox has no choice, it's an Apple regulated process.\n2) The new file is stored in the other applications bundle\n3) iCloud works similarly but not really. Since iCloud is developed by Apple they obviously have more freedom to do what they want. When you store a document in the cloud it stays there and you can manipulate it in the cloud, or download it to the device and manipulate there as well and re-upload it. Other apps can do this too, but they must code for it themselves, it's not just handed to them. Apps can take months to build and are a lot of work because of all these work-arounds, so don't take them for granted. I'm surprised stuff sells for just .99 cents when they have been in development for 12 months. \nYour only alternative is to find an app that allows editing PDF's, and has a share extension for Dropbox, for now, submit a feature request to Dropbox in the mean time to let them know that it's a feature users want and will use and just wait. \nEDIT I normally don't like to link to apps or other software but since it's within the realm of the question defined I will post a link to software similar to the goal you are trying to achieve, but as objective and unbiased as I can; I share no relationship with either app :\niAnnotate \nPDF Expert5\nEdits PDFs from Dropbox, so does numerous other third party apps, you will just have to find whats best suited for you. \n", "Q: Removing from dock when quitting Many programs are not removed from the dock when quitting them (using apple-Q) or when closing their visible windows. I know this behaviour is on purpose, but I don't like it. Is their a way to consistently enforce that programs are really closed (i.e., the process is terminated), and hence removed from the dock when quitting / closing the windows?\n\nA: I found an answer here: https://superuser.com/questions/53935/getting-mac-os-x-applications-to-close-after-last-window-closed\nEssentially, there's a program called RedQuits that automatically quits application when you close the last window.\nBUT, it does no work for Yosemite. So still no dice.\nThe thing about applications not closing when hiting Cmd-Q was probably me misremembering things, because I couldn't find back any application doing that.\n\nA: I had this issue with Word. The program would open but the Word icon would stay in the dock after I quit the program. \nTry:\nGo to System Preferences > Dock\nUncheck \"Show recent applications in Dock\"\nNow the word icon will be removed from the dock after I quit it.\n\nA: You can remove those apps by right clicking on the Dock icon and choosing Options -> Remove from Dock, or drag the app icon from Dock to the top untill You see Remove label. After this, app will automatically dissapear from Dock after quitting. \n\nA: Dock doesn't contain programs in it. It is just aliases of those.\nThere permanent (sticking aliases) and temporal ones.\nWhen you drag some app to dock you assign alias for that app in the dock. Or if you choose Keep in Dock from context menu of present alias. When you launch that app you get dot under it denoting it is launched.\n\nWhen you launch an app by other means — from Finder or spotlight you get temporal alias for that app in the dock it will vanish the moment you will quit an app.\nOnly way for you for dock to do what you want is to remove all icons from the dock. This way you will be left with only Finder and Trash. And any other app you specifically launched.\n", "Q: How to make Apple Mail.app to use SOCKS proxy configured by a PAC file For some reasons, I have to use a SOCKS proxy to access Gmail, otherwise, the connection will be blocked.\nI tried the global SOCKS agent, and the Mail.app worked fine.

It kind of sounds like a woodpecker or something, not a scraping noise.. does anyone know what could be wrong?\n\nA: As previously mentioned, it's either the hard drive,but it sounds to me like something might be impeding one of your fans. I used to hear something similar with an older MBP I had and it was the fan on the GPU. Might be worth taking it into a qualified Apple dealer/service point.\n", "Q: Read information inside PDF? I'd like to automate the invoices I receive from a particular company. Unfortunately they name the files very strangely and the filename is not at all related to invoice number, or date. So I'm trying to find something to extract information from inside the PDF. I would look for particular strings and numbers. I can think of Spotlight that would be able to do that, but I don't think that's the best way. Suggestions and solutions to this particular problem are welcome.\nThank you!\n\nA: For that kind of things I use Hazel. I have a very easy way to filter PDF contents based on rules. The below image contains a rule that I use to organise my invoices. Hazel keeps watching a folder, and acts on every new file there based on your defined rules.\n\n\nA: Without seeing one of the files it is difficult to give specific advice. I would try an Automator workflow. There is a PDF library which can perform many actions e.g. Extract metadata from PDF documents, Extract text from PDF documents\n\nA: You don't even have to buy Hazel - just create an auto-running Automator script that puts files in a specified folder that were downloaded from the specified website/s.\n", "Q: Export iCloud items from Keychain to CSV I want to export all my accounts login/password from Keychain. But you have many categories like : login, iCloud, System... in the Keychain menu. In fact I want to export them to 1Password, so I follow this overflow answer.\nBut in ~/Library/Keychains/ I have only the login.keychain and not the hopefully iCloud.keychain...\nI have 422 accounts in the iCloud category and only 5 on the login category...\nSo my question is, how can I save/export this iCloud category \n\ninto a keychain or .csv file ?\nEDIT :\nI have already a login.keychain file. But I don't know how I can make an iCloud.keychain file.\n\n\nA: A late reply, as I found this post while searching for something related.\nYou have to create a new keychain, and copy your iCloud keychain items to the new local keychain.  Then you can use the security tool to dump them.\nSince this is 1Password-related question, for others in the future, you can use MrC's conversion utility to directly convert the keychain dump into a 1Password consumable 1PIF file.  It is much better than CSV importing.\nhttps://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/30286/mrcs-convert-to-1password-utility/p1\n\nA: It's easy. Open Safari, go to Preferences, and then Passwords. Click on the three dots at the bottom, you will see Import Passwords and Export Passwords. This will export as .csv. Also, the passwords are not masked or Encrypted.  \n\nA: I'm on 10.13.6. The MrC's tool, while great for the local keychain, it didn't work for me for iCloud items. Nor did the script to retrieve passwords from Safari.\nmoxiefrog at 1Password forums posted a solution based on Automator that worked for me. Essentially, this script mimics a user doing copy-paste from each item to a text file.\nBelow is moxiefrog's code which I have adapted for my macOS version. You may have to adjust the number of tabs (see keystroke tab below), also taking into consideration what fields you would like to copy. As it is, running the script will produce a text file with the following format:\nusername,website,password\n\nSteps\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and create a new document\n\n*Open Keychain\n\n*Click on the iCloud keychain and sort it in the order that will be copied to the text document\n\n*Locate the line keystroke \"password\" and insert your password (including the quotes)\n\n*Run it once and check if it copied successfully, otherwise you may have to adjust the delay's and/or order and number of tabs.\n\n*If everything went fine, increase the repeat value in the first line. Doing batches of 50 is recommended.\n\n*Save the text file file as .csv.\n\nScript\nrepeat 1 times\n    delay 0.2\n    tell application \"Keychain Access\"\n        activate\n        \n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            --- Open a keychain item\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke return\n            --- Press Tab x3\n            delay 0.1\n            keystroke tab\n            delay 0.1\n            keystroke tab\n            delay 0.1\n            keystroke tab\n            \n            -- Press ⌘C to copy item title\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"c\" using command down\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    --Switch to TextEdit\n    delay 0.2\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- Press ⌘V\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"v\" using command down\n            \n            -- Type a comma\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \",\"\n            \n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    --Switch to Keychain\n    tell application \"Keychain Access\"\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- Press Tab x2 \n            delay 0.1\n            keystroke tab\n            \n            -- Press ⌘C\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"c\" using command down\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    --Switch to TextEdit\n    delay 0.2\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- Press ⌘V\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"v\" using command down\n            \n            -- Type ','\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \",\"\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    --Switch to Keychain\n    tell application \"Keychain Access\"\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- Click the “Show password:” checkbox.\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"c\" using {shift down, command down}\n            \n            -- Type password - update to yours\n            delay 0.5\n            keystroke \"password\"\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke return\n            \n            -- Close keychain item window\n            delay 0.3\n            keystroke \"w\" using command down\n            \n            -- Go to next keychain item\n            delay 0.2\n            key code 125\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    \n    --Switch to TextEdit\n    delay 0.2\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- Press ⌘V\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke \"v\" using command down\n            \n            -- Press Return\n            delay 0.2\n            keystroke return\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend repeat\nend run\n\nDisclaimer\n\nUse at your own risk.

Pretty dumb, I know.\nStill, is it somehow possible to get an older version of that keychain that still keeps the password?\n\nA: I just ran into the same situation and unfortunately no you cannot restore iCloud keychain from your own backup.\nSee Apple's support note on the topic https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20120, specifically:\n\nPasswords stored in the iCloud keychain are encrypted and stored on your computer and can’t be copied. \n\nAs you, I tried copying other keychain files and 'keychain-db' files, but none of the iCloud passwords were contained in those.\n\nA: I was just able to do this. Here's the procedure I took. I suspect some of these steps might be extraneous, but I didn't have time to experiment, so I went nuclear:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed MacBook from network - unplugged cable, turned off AirPort\n\n*Logged out of account.\n\n*Logged in as different admin user, and restored the iCloud Keychain directory for the original, which, FYI is named a random UUID, e.g. 48579CB8-D696-401C-913F-E3F87181CFD2, and lives in /Users//Library/Keychains/. Obviously, you need sudo to do this.\n\n*Restarted, and logged in original account\n\n*Opened Keychain Access, found the relevant key, copied the password, etc. to a temporary location.\n\n*Repeated steps 2 through 4, but instead, restoring the most recent version of the iCloud Keychain.\n\n\nSo, I was able to get the key that was accidentally deleted from the backup, but there was some ensuing weirdness:\nFirst, I started getting Push Notification prompts saying my passwords were wrong for my standard Mail, Contacts & Calendar accounts.\nThen, I opened Keychain Access, and noticed iCloud Keychain had returned to being Local Items (that's its name if you don't use iCloud Keychain).\nFinally, I went to iCloud Preferences, and noticed that iCloud Keychain was now disabled. So, something in my procedure caused that. I turned it back on, gave it a minute, and all was right in the world.\nExcept... I had to re-enable Unlock my Mac with my Watch. Presumably, that's not restored from iCloud Keychain, which makes sense.\n\nA: Here's a procedure I followed that allowed me to recover an older accidentally overwritten password in my keychain (in my case Safari suggested a new password and asked if I wanted to update the password in my keychain before the website I was changing my password on rejected my new password).  I found this easier to do the the method described by jaydisc.    This method depends on using Time Machine backups, but since many Mac Users will have a few days of local backups on their machine, this often works.\n\n*\n\n*Go to my ~/Library/Keychains directory.  There are directories with long UUIDs that contain the iCloud keychain (e.g., 871ED613-9835-5A2A-883B-1D25F123686F).  Identify the directory corresponding to your current iCloud account - in my case there were several such directories but only one had a keychain-2.db file in it that had been recently updated.\n\n\n*Disconnect from the network and quit the Keychain Access app.\n\n\n*Rename the iCloud keychain directory to something else.\n\n\n*Open Time Machine and navigate to the ~/Library/Keychains directory.  Navigate to a backup prior to when the password was lost / changed.  Restore the iCloud keychain directory.\n\n\n*Exit Time Machine.  At this point if you launch the Keychain Access app you will not be able to access any passwords stored in your iCloud keychain - MacOS needs network access to unlock the restored keychain file.\n\n\n*Quit Keychain Access.  Turn on the network and quickly launch Keychain Access.  Click on your iCloud Keychain to verify that you can see items stored in it.  Quickly disconnect from the network before the OS has a chance to synchronize the local keychain you just restored with what is stored on iCloud.  Find your saved password in the restored keychain.\n\n\n*If you want to go back to the most recent version of the keychain, before the old back you restored, quit Keychain access again.  Copy the name of the iCloud keychain directory, delete it, and rename the old version of the iCloud keychain directory to the name you copied.\n\nA: In my case, Airport network passwords had been deleted due to some sort of iCloud syncing error. I followed jaydisc's answer successfully, but I actually wanted to restore the keys instead of copying out individual passwords. I found a way of doing this.\nAfter I restored the previous keychain directory (Library/Keychains/<UUID>) using jaydisc's answer, once the Mac connected to the Internet it would \"update\" to the version with the keys deleted.\nHowever, before reconnecting to the Internet, if I caused the modification date of each key to be updated, I found the keys would remain in the keychain once reconnected to the Internet.\nIn the case of my Airport network password keys, I updated the Where attribute of each key from AirPort to something else, then changed them back to AirPort. This marked each key as newly modified, and allowed them to survive connecting back to the Internet.\n\nA: Restore either ~Users/[User]/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\nor ~Library/Keychains/System.keychain ( Select 'Keep both' option in Time Machine)\nOpen the newly restored file with the keyChain Access app.\nYou will be able to open the older entries in the restored file, and copy, or export them to your live keychain.\n", "Q: Is it possible to access a list of wifi networks my iPhone has used? I understand I may have to jailbreak my phone to access this, but is there a way to view a list of networks my iPhone has remembered and get info on the date they were last accessed?\nI know there are some apps that allow you to view all the stored passwords for previously accessed networks but I'm also interested in seeing the date they were last accessed.\nThanks in advance of any help you can give.\n\nA: 1. If you have iCloud Keychain enabled :\n\nAre my existing saved passwords, Wi-Fi networks, and Internet accounts included in iCloud Keychain?\n  Yes. When you turn on iCloud Keychain, any previously-saved website usernames and passwords, Wi-Fi networks, and Internet accounts are automatically included in iCloud Keychain.\n\nFrom : \nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085\n\n\n*\n\n*You can access to Keychain by the Keychain Access.app (located in /Applications/Utilities/).\n\n\n2. Otherwise you can use 1Password.\n3. Finally, you have this post :\nIs there any way to view saved wifi passwords on the iPhone?\n\nUnfortunately, on the iPhone it is not possible to access this information. The passwords are kept on your phone in a safe place that is not accessible through any regular means on the phone. This is done for your protection, if you were to lose your iPhone and someone picked it up, the passwords that are stored on it would be up for grabs. This would lead to a lot of security problems.\n\n\nA: Yes, but there's a catch to the keychain; see below.\nThe following is all for Yosemite (I had version 10.10.3).\nTo see wifi networks you've connected to from your iOS devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your OSX device (eg your Mac), make sure you are logged in to iCloud (via System Preferences).\n\n*Open the Keychain Access app desribed above.\n\n*On the left, in the Keychains box, click \"iCloud\".\n\n*In the main display, click on \"Kind\" to sort all entries by kind.\n\n*All the wifi networks will now be listed together with the kind \"AirPort network password\".\n\n\nTo view a wifi password:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click one of the displayed entries (or right-click it and select Show Info).\n\n*Click the checkbox next to \"Show Password\".\n\n*Enter your iCloud password.\n\n\nThe catch\nYou have to enter the iCloud password you had when you first connected to that network. If you have since changed your iCloud password, your current iCloud password won't work. There won't even be an error message: after you click OK, no password will be displayed, that's all.\nThis is obviously a bad problem: who can remember their old iCloud passwords? It's sad that Apple hasn't fixed this yet.\nPersonally, I get around the problem by using 1Password (https://agilebits.com) whenever I change my iCloud password. 1Password keeps a log of all my previously created passwords with their creation dates; so, I look at the Keychain Access entry's \"Date Modified\", and then in 1Password I choose the last iCloud password I created before that date.\n", "Q: Why iPad Music app says \"No Content\" and I cannot download music to it Firstly, I have been using iPad for a few days and this things may be very nooby for you.

My machine is an upgraded MacPro 1,1 with X5365's and a flashed AMD7950 running 10.8.5. I have an expansion chassis connected with the host card in slot 4.\nReally appreciate any help with this.\n\nA: For anyone finding this thread via a Google search, I have found and eliminated the cause of the kernel panics.\nThe problem was a failing PSU, both, inside the MacPro as well as the Magma expansion chassis. See here for details:\nI have since built a Hackintosh and have not had any further problems with intermittent kernel panics.\n\nA: Some years ago I had the problem of frequent kernel panics with my Mac Pro 1,1 ... it turned out that the inside of the case had lots of dust.  When I cleared that out, the kernel panics stopped.\nI'm sure every case is different.  This may not help you, but I will put it here for future people who have this problem.\n", "Q: Headphones, MacBook Pro, Parallels and no sound on the headphones I have Parallels installed on my MacBook Pro.  I have a headset plugged in.  There is no option to choose to play sound on the headset.  My options are Internal Speakers and Internal Sound or Parallels Access Sound for both input and output.  What do I need to change in order for the headphones to be usable?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Sound Click on headphones or internal speakers\n", "Q: Sync Notes from Mac and iOS devices without iCloud I did some research, and discovered that people have had nightmares with syncing notes from the Notes app via iCloud, in that all of the notes get permanently deleted. Before seeing these articles/forum posts, I had considered activating cloud sync for my notes, but given the danger, I don't think I'd like to do that.\nThus, I'm looking for an alternative solution. I have heard of OneNote, Box, and so on, but what I have not found is a way to sync one's notes from the Notes app on both Mac and iOS across some other cloud. If anyone has any ideas I would really appreciate it.\n\nA: NOTE: i assume in my answer that you just don't want the Apple iCloud servers\nyou need an other email account to do this\n\n*\n\n*you add one more email account (any but not iCloud)\n\n*and then you activate at this email account the section NOTES\n\n*the notes are created in an imap folder named notes\n\n*do it on both: iPhone and Mac\n\n*then you move all notes on Mac to the other account\n\n*then you can switch off the NOTES with the iCloud account\n\niPhone (iOS10):\nSettings -> Notes -> Accounts -> (some account) -> notes -> switch: on/off\nOSX 10.11.6\nSettings -> Internet Accounts -> (some account) -> notes -> checkbox: on/off\n\nA: I tried @muescha answer and it worked for me. To follow up with questions from @August Mohr (sr I don't have enough reputation to comment), You need to add new email account to your Internet Accounts in Settings. It's here\n\nThe NOTES section is inside the Notes app, it's in the left side drawer.\n\nYou must drag all of your notes under this email section. Then at your new Mac, you can drag them out to On your Mac. It works for my M1 2020 today.\n", "Q: Vertical monitor setup with Yosemite I have a MBA (m2011 - Yosemite) with an external monitor setup (Dell 2007FP). I would like to use the Dell monitor in vertical mode by trying to rotate 90 degree in Display setup but the screen stay in horizonal resolution (black area above and below).\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Depending on your version of Mac O/S there should be controls in \"Displays\" that allow you to rotate the display. On the Snow Leopard mac I have at work there is a menu to the right that says \"Rotation:\" and a menu with Standard, 90, 180 and 270 degree selections available in it.\nI seem to recall it looks a little different in newer versions of Mac O/S\n\nA: You were on the right track, when you rotate in 90 degrees and see the black areas above and below, click \"arrangement\" then uncheck \"mirror\" and it will pop up normal in full vertical screen.\n", "Q: Is it possible to force a apple wireless keyboard to disconnect, from the keyboard? I have a single keyboard that is paired to multiple iOS devices.   Once it's actively connected to one of them, it seems the only way to get it to be willing to connect with another is to turn off bluetooth on the current device.   Is there a magic key chord or something that will kick the current device off so a new one can connect?\n\nA: No, I do not believe the Apple Keyboard has a hotkey to do multi-device switching, but Logitech does have a couple with switching capability. Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard (K480) and the Easy Switch Keyboard (K811).\n", "Q: import music from my ipad i just re-installed my mbp, and have deleted whole disk. i think my music is safe because i had sync it to my ipad.   \nbut after installation done, i can't get my music from my ipad. in iTunes, when i try to click sync music, it showing me an alert that iTunes will remove all music from my ipad.  \ni know i can sync with auto download purchase items. but i got this music not from itunes stores. i got it by copied from my band studio, ( and some just copied from cd)  \ndo you know how to get the music sync back to the mac without delete from ipad?\n\nA: The fantastic thing with iExplorer is that it not only transfers and imports your media data into iTunes but also imports the playlists. And you can access all data, even the preferences files from the apps. And you can make backups on your own on app basis if you like. :) Great software, fully worth the ~ 35 dollars.\n\nA: iTunes can't, but some third-party App let you transfer music from iOS device. \nFor example, iExplorer 3 app specializes in this and makes iTunes media transfers incredibly quick and easy. It has an Auto Transfer feature which will rebuild your entire iTunes library from any iDevice in a single, one-click transfer and include your playlists, play counts, ratings, and other metadata. It can also transfer any of your photos, videos, podcasts, text messages, ringtones, books, notes, voicemails, contacts, calendars, voice memos, and more to a Mac or PC. \n\nA: I've used PhoneView a couple times and I love it.

Also make sure the process does not daemonize itself. According to the monit man page this is accomplished by using the -I option.\n\nA: I suspect since it is running from /Library/LaunchDaemons/  and not the user ~/Library/LaunchAgents you need to use sudo to issue the command with permission.\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.monit.service.plist\n", "Q: Cannot compress any file I get a popup \"The contents list can’t be created for compressing.\"\nevery time when I try to compress a file.\nAnd also thumbnail preview is not working. \nI am sure if both issues are related but they both happened today.\nI've tried repairing disk permissions, deleting finder plist, restart but none of this works.\nI am running Yosemite 10.10.1\nAny suggestion?\n=================================\nI went to Apple Store and they can't fix this.\nThey reinstall the Mac for me.\nThanks for all answers.\n\nA: Run the following commands in order in Terminal.

But unfortunately I need some application that only worked on Mountain Lion and I cannot restore back to Mountain Lion as I did not have backup. Now is it possible to install Mountain Lion on USB disk from which I also boot from without actually installing on my MacBook AIR Samsung SSD drive ( the only drive on the system) on which Yosemite is installed and running?\n\nA: You can buy the ML from App store.\nThen install it on USB following these instructions from Apple-HT202796.\nThen hold the Option key during boot to select the start up disk.\nHow ever, running from USB disk can be slow.\nAlternative->better solution is to create a new partition (size to be determined) and install the ML on it, if you are using the ML frequently.\n", "Q: What does \"EFI system partition couldn't be created\" mean?

Is it just complaining because there is no EFI system partition, or is it something more serious?\nThis is an 3TB external hard disk I use for external storage (e.g., Time Machine backups, other data), and it is not bootable.  diskutil list shows that it is partitioned with 2 partitions (one for Time Machine, one for data) but no EFI partition.  I suspect the partition table was created under Linux rather than Mac OS X.  The disk has been working fine up until recently.  I did read Why does Disk Utility create EFI partitions on external disks?; that and other sources gave me the impression that a EFI partition is not strictly required unless you want to boot from the disk.\n\nA: Set your Disk utility in to Debug mode.\nNow you should be able to \"see\" the hidden partitions like EFI and the Recovery HD.\nTo enable the Debug mode use your Terminal:\nEnter the following command at the Terminal prompt:\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\nNeedless to say, there is a reason for those partitions to be hidden, so do not mess around with them on your start up disk.\n", "Q: How can I tell Time Machine to keep using its former backup? For some reason Time Machine doesn't think that the backups on my external drive are for my current computer.\nHow can I point Time Machine at the former backup files so it can pick up where it left off?\n\nA: On OS X 10.7 Lion or later, yes. You need to look at the tmutil command, specifically the inheritbackup verb (which tells Time Machine that this is a backup of this machine, and not some other), and the associatedisk verb (which tells Time Machine that the disk it was backing up before is this other disk that you have now).\n", "Q: What is /System/Library/CoreServices/WiFiAgent.app? Recently, I've been a bit worried about malware, so I've been examining my system and searching for out-of-place applications/programs, and this one stood out.  \nFor one, when looking at the file in Finder, it's called Wi-Fi.app, but when looking at it via the command line, it's called WiFiAgent.app.  In other words, in Finder, I see only a \"Wi-Fi.app\", but on the command line, I see only a \"WiFiAgent.app\".  Moreover, I tried searching for both apps, with neither returning very many results.\nWhat is this app?\n\nA: WiFiAgent.app is part of OS X and is the agent responsible for all things Wi-Fi in the GUI.\nThis includes everything from managing the menu bar item to showing dialogs for entering the wireless key of the network. The agent runs in the background on all Macs with a wireless service.\nHere's a converted version of the WiFiAgent.app Localizable.strings which shows some of the features of the agent through the messages that can be localised.\nThe reason why WiFiAgent.app is shown in Finder as \"Wi-Fi.app\" is because of the InfoPlist.strings file defining CFBundleDisplayName:\n{   CFBundleDisplayName = \"Wi-Fi\";\n    CFBundleName = \"WiFiAgent\";\n}\n\nContents/Resources/InfoPlist.strings\n", "Q: Log in and out of iTunes account on separate computer Is it possible to use someone else's computer, log out of their iTunes account, log into your own account and access your own library on their computer?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible, but it takes quite a long time. The simplest way would be to enable iTunes Match on your own computer, and then sign in to the other computer. Another way would be to backup the com.apple.iTunes.plist file in your ~/Library/Preferences directory to an external hard disk, along with the ~/Music/iTunes folder. Then, on the other person's computer, move their com.apple.iTunes.plist file to a safe place (desktop, etc) and copy your com.apple.iTunes.plist file to their Preferences folder (see path above). Then, repeat the process for the iTunes folder in their Music folder.\nIt's complicated, but it works well for me.\nP.S.

Some information about what I am trying to achieve\nI am using emacs inside of terminal. I know about existence of cocoa versions of emacs (like GNU Emacs for OS X, Aquamacs and Emacs Mac Port). But I prefer to code inside of terminal. \nEverything is fine in my setup except the fact that sometimes I want to open file inside of emacs from Finder or any other software. So I need find running process of emacs in terminal or create new one and open the fine inside of running emacs. \nSo basically I need to create an .app wrapper for opening files in terminal emacs. \nTrying to get it done\nAs far as I understand, open -a my_emacs_app /path/to/file is the same as opening file in application from finder. So that's why I am testing my_emacs_app using open command.\nMy first attempt is to create application using AppleScript. Here is the code that process passed arguments:\non run argv\n    if (count of argv) > 0 then\n        -- get file path from argv\n        -- and log to logfile for testing purposes\n        return \"defined\"\n    else\n        -- no args means no file\n        -- log to logfile that we can't extract file path\n        -- from empty arguments\n        return \"failed\"\n    end if\nend run\n\nAnd actually it works when I try to run it using\n$ osascript my_emacs_app.scpt /path/to/file\n\nIt opens the file and logs what expected to log file.\nWhen I run it using\n$ osascript my_emacs_app.scpt\n\nIt logs to file that no arguments were passed. \nSo I was happy with it. But remember, I need an .app wrapper. So I am exporting this script as application (and place it inside of /Applications/ folder). And then when I try to\n$ open -a my_emacs_app /path/to/file\n\nI see that application is executed for a short time and then is closed. But nothing good happens. I mean, file is not opened in emacs and nothing is logged into log file. \nDoes any one know, how to export such scripts? \n\nA: After few different attempts and hacks I found good solution to solve my problem. First - implement the script. Then open the Automator.app and create new application. Then combine Get Specified Finder Items action and Run AppleScript. So now open -a my_automator_app /path/to/file will pass /path/to/file/ to my script. And that's cool.\nP. S. in the argv will be stored the alias to the file, not the posix file path. To convert it from alias to posix you should use\nset aliasPath to item 1 of item 1 of argv\nset filePath to (the POSIX path of aliasPath)\n\nOh and don't forget that you might want to get the quoted form of filePath in case it contains some special characters (like space or ~).\nYou can get more information about alias/posix paths here \n\nA: From man open in EXAMPLES section:\n\n\"open -a /Applications/TextEdit.app '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'\" opens the document in the application specified (in this case, TextEdit).\n\nSo You can specify path to Your AppleScript application after -a argument.\nI tested this and it works for me, path does not have to be absolute.\n", "Q: Is there a TODO list app for mac you can change Font Size?

I was playing around with Test Flight - to put a version on my colleagues phone took 24-48 hours while we were separated. Normally he would work beside me and I can just directly compile to the device with a cable.\nIIRC before Test Flight was absorbed by Apple the process was virtually instantaneous now it seems there is a giant propagation delay and nobody is talking about the delay or there is little mention of how long the whole process should take. \nHave I done something wrong on my part or is this just part of the process?\n\nA: I use Testflight OS X desktop app to upload a binary and it usually takes minutes for recipients to receive build notification emails. \n", "Q: Drag and Drop file to desktop when windows are maximized I typically maximize my windows to the full size of the screen and then rather than clicking windows to navigate through them I cmd+tab to switch between applications. The only problem that this  causes is that whenever I have to drag a file from my finder to the desktop all these maximized windows are in the way.\nIs there any efficient way to move the file to the desktop. I've looked for right click \"move to desktop\" and I've look for some icon at the top of the screen I can drag it into and those don't exist.\n\nA: You have several possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the sidebar and drag & drop files or folders on the 'Desktop' item\n\n*Create a 'Desktop' Dock item by dragging and dropping the folder '/Users/YourUserName/Desktop' to the Dock and afterwards drag & drop files or folders you want to move on the 'Desktop' item in your Dock\n\n*Create an Automator Service to move (or copy) chosen items to the 'Desktop' folder (rough example)\n\n\nA: In addition to klanomath's answer:\nYou can also assign a Hot Corner to show the Desktop. In that way you can drag a file to the Hot Corner, the Desktop shows, then drop the file on the Desktop. Move your mouse to the hot corner again to show the original window.\nThe Hot Corner functionality can be found in the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preference pane.\n\nA: You can also use Keyboard Shortcut to show Desktop while dragging the files.

I am considering purchasing a used iPad 3rd generation 8.9 size.  This iPad is advertised as a used 64gb Verizon iPad.  I only want to use the iPad on wifi and do not want to connect to Verizon or AT&T.  Can I do this or do I have to go through Verizon to get it to work. I have never had an iPad and I am 67 years of age so I am not familiar with what I need to look for or be careful about in buying a used iPad.  \n\nA: Yes, you will be able to use the iPad without a Verizon SIM card through your WiFi network. However, it appears that there is a problem where the iPad keeps notifying you that there is no SIM card.\nI would advise getting one without cellular data as you don't plan on using it anyway. Those iPads are probably cheaper and will not have the previously described problem.\n\nA: Yes, you can use it without activating the cellular radio. \n", "Q: How can I edit my cookies in Safari Web Inspector?

I believe it was bought in 2006.\nWhen I plug it into the right hand side USB port of a 2012 retina MacBook Pro, nothing happens. When I plug it into the left hand side port, it works fine.\nDoes this indicate a problem with the computer and its ports?  Does it indicate a problem with the USB drive?\nAll other devices I tried worked with both the left and right hand side USB port.\n\nA: System Management Controller (SMC)\nReset the SMC by following the instructions below, that should restore the power to the port:\n1.Shut down the computer.\n2.Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n3.On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n4.Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n5.Press the power button to turn on the computer.\nNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\n", "Q: Launch console application in iTerm on boot How can I launch some command (console application) in iTerm2 on system boot?

Then you can use cmd~ to switch between active windows. Since they are all open in their own window, you will never lose your place in any of the documents.\nThe cmd~ shortcut works for any application you have open, which has more than one window open, AFAIK.\nIf you are set on keeping all of the PDFs under one Preview window, I think klanomath's suggestion would be your best bet.\n\nA: Option+Page Up/Down.

This is a Macbook Pro(Retina, 2012) with OS X Yosemite. I created a new user, and checked 'click or tap with two fingers' for the 'Secondary click'. However, the right-click menu doesn't show up when I tap or click with two fingers, nor if I right click an external mouse. I have to right click twice, very quickly, either on the trackpad or an external mouse, in order to get the pop-up menu.\nThis is really annoying and I haven't found any solutions online.\nUpdate 1: I changed the 'Secondary click' setting to something else and then back to 'click or tap with two fingers'. And now everything works expect for Google Chrome. I still have to double-right-click on a webpage in Chrome to bring up the menu. However, interestingly, on the tab bar and tool bar, etc., (i.e., everywhere except for the webpage itself in Chrome), a single-right-click works...\n\nA: I uninstall Chrome extension \"crxMouse Chrome Gestures\" and install Smooth Gestures Plus and its plugin SmoothGesturesPlusExtras. Solve my problem but the extension isn't free.\n\nA: Check whether you have the SmoothGestures plugin installed.  This is a known issue.   \nYou can navigate to \nchrome://extensions/\nand disable SmoothGestures to see if it fixes the issue.\nSource: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/PlsuvMGbi_o\nSmoothGestures has released an additional plugin to work around this issue. http://www.smoothgestures.com/installplugin.html\nIf the problem is not the SmoothGestures plugin, check other Chrome plugins to make sure they aren't changing the mouse behavior either.\n", "Q: How to download any iOS manually? I'm still stuck on iOS 7 because iTunes and the blessed updaters don't work.\niTunes will start the download, but always drops the connection before finishing. It appears to be incapable of resuming an interrupted download.\nI rely on an unlimited mobile data plan from a carrier that doesn't push OTA updates, so my device will only self-update over a WiFi connection that I don't really have. Routing the connection by LTE => iPad => USB tethering to Mac => internet sharing => WiFi device-to-device network => back to iPad sort-of works occasionally. Indeed it's how I got iOS 7, but it's way too flaky now.\nIs there any possibility of using a sane, stable HTTP client to get the file?\n\nA: I've had the same issue, when I had connectivity issues - you're right, it never does appear to resume.\nYou can get the update file directly from https://ipsw.me\nthis site merely links to the correct location at Apple for the file you require & so is safe to use \nGet the latest version for your device.\nThis is not a way to downgrade your iOS, merely to fetch the current one by an alternative method.  \nIf you still have difficulty resuming, then use a separate downloader app, SpeedDownload for Mac or Wget for Windows, etc.\nLaunch iTunes.\nPlug the phone to your computer.  \nThen, in iTunes, hold Opt [alt] when clicking the Check for Update button & a file-picker will open instead.

When I'm reading this guide it seems to be quite straightforward.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH18705?viewlocale=en_US\nBut I was expecting to be typing the ip address. I don't understand what they mean by\nnfs://DNSname/pathname\n\nDNSname and pathname. Can someone elaborate?\n(I'm trying to connect to my seagate business storage nas)\n\nA: In order to mount an NFS share as a client, you need essentially two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The name or IP address of the server, referred to as DNSName\n\n*The share path\n\n\nHow do you find this stuff out?\nThis assumes you don't know what the share paths are.  If you already know, skip down to \"Connecting\"\nUsing my own personal Synology Diskstation as an example, I have shared two directories via NFS.  It's DNS name is diskstation.home.  Its IP address is 192.168.1.50 (not really, but it is for the sake of this example)\nLaunch the Terminal App.\nAt the prompt, type the following command:\nshowmount -e diskstation.home\n(replace diskstation.home with your DNSname or IP Address)\n\nIn my example, the following is displayed:\n$ showmount -e diskstation.home\nExports list on diskstation.home:\n/volume1/netbackup                  *\n/volume1/Network Share              *\n\nOk...so now I know what the two \"share paths\" are.  It's time to connect.\nConnecting\nLet's use finder:\nPress CommandK to bring up the \"Connect to Server\" Dialog Box.\nIn the \"Server Address\" box, type enter the values in the format:\nnfs://DNSName/path\nor\nnfs://IP/path\n\nSo, going back to my example, I would type:\nnfs://diskstation.home/volume1/netbackup\nor\nnfs://192.168.1.50/volume1/netbackup\n\nYou should now be able to browse your network share.\n\nA: After choosing 'Connect to Server...' in Finder with cmdK you may also use an IP-address instead of the DNS-name.\nSo if your NAS is at 192.168.1.10 (or mynas.example.home) and you've exported a share called 'Share', make sure the NAS provides you the entire pathname - sometimes they'll append /mnt/ (or /mount/ or /nfs/) to the path.\nInstead of simple nfs://192.168.1.10/Share (or nfs://mynas.example.home/Share) you'd use nfs://192.168.1.10/mnt/Share (or nfs://mynas.example.home/mnt/Share) then.\n\nA: They are telling you to use the \"DNSname/pathname\" because using DNS is preferred to using IP addresses in most cases (humans typically remember words better than numbers).  \nHowever, this is contingent upon you having DNS configured.\nUsing the device's IP address and path to the share will work just fine, it just isn't as friendly for remembering the address and telling other people how to access it.\n", "Q: I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 1TB iMac (with BootCamp) this is a somewhat similar post to this one (Can't create partition on free space with Disk Utility) but not quite...\nIt started with me creating a BootCamp partition (around 145 GB) for Windows 8 quite some time ago. \nEverything was working fine until I decided to upgrade to 8.1 from the Windows store - the installation went fine but Windows never managed to boot again. I managed to fix the iMac into booting OSX and forgot about it until today (oh why?!)\nI decided I will give 8.1 another go - as the partition was there and so I wanted to use it by trying to install over it again. I chose the EFI install and went for it, but the installer informed me that it will not install, because the partition has MBR instead of GPT.\nSo instead of running the installer again in normal mode - I logged back into OSX deleted the BOOTCAMP partition (or so I then thought), ran the installer again in EFI and told it to create a partition for itself in the free space and install Windows.\nThe installer created 3 partition - 1 large one and 2 small ones. I didn't like that so went back to OS X tried to delete those partitions, but that of course didn't work and my drive became messier and messier. By that time I knew I was not very smart about it and tried to delete all the partitions I thought I didn't need from the Windows Installer.\nI messed up even more... OSX stopped booting. I then read and performed steps from the above mentioned thread. But all along my diskutil list showed 2 physical volumes instead of 1.\nSo I followed all the steps from the above thread and this is the effect at the moment:\nDisk Utility - No hidden

Why are there 2 physical volumes and what to do with them?\nIf anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Theoretically everything is fine with your Fusion Drive. Fusion Drives look like this. Disk0 is your SSD with 121 GB and disk1 is your HDD with ~1 TB (~1.121 TB summed up). \nThe larger parts of your SSD (disk0s2) and your HDD (disk1s2) are pooled to a CoreStorage LVG (Fusion Drive: disk3) with a size of 967.8 GB. The rest is reserved for EFIs, a Recovery HD (alltogether ~1.3 GB) and your old Windows partition - now probably free space (~152 GB).\nThe logical volume 'Macintosh HD' (967.8 GB) spans disk0s2 and disk1s2. This is the first 'Macintosh HD' in picture 1. The volume 'Macintosh HD' - it's the one visible on the desktop - should ideally also have about 967.8 GB. This is the second 'Macintosh HD' in picture 1.\nIn fact it has only 852.67 GB (see picture 3).\nIn the second picture the logical volume 'Macintosh HD' is the first listed in black, the volume 'Macintosh HD' is the second listed in black, the other two 'Macintosh HD's listed in grey are the parts of your SSD and HDD dedicated to the logical volume 'Macintosh HD'.\nIn my opinion something went wrong after deleting various partitions with the Bootcamp Assistant/Disk Utility or in Windows.\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Mavericks or Yosemite).\nNow you may either repair CoreStorage or rebuild your Fusion Drive:\n'Repair CoreStorage' (not recommended):\n\n\n*\n\n*First i would try to check the volume 'Macintosh HD' with Disk Utility.\nIf the volume is corrupted consider a reinstall of Mac OS X.\n\n*If the volume is ok quit Disk Utility\n\n*Open Terminal and enter diskutil unmountDisk /dev/LVIdentifier and both diskutil unmountDisk /dev/DiskContainingApple_CoreStorageIdentifier\nIn your case: first diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3 then diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0 and diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1\n\n*remove the EFI NO NAME partition with gpt remove -i IndexNumberOfEFINoName DiskIdentifier:\ngpt remove -i 4 disk1\n\n*Remount the CoreStorage disks and then the Logical Volume:\nIn your case: first diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk0 and diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk1 and then diskutil mount /dev/disk3.\n\n*enter gpt -r -vvv show /dev/diskIdentfierOfApple_CoreStorage to get infos of your HDD CoreStorage disk.\nIn your case: gpt -r -vvv show /dev/disk1\nIt should look like this:\n-bash-3.2# gpt -r -vvv show /dev/disk1\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: mediasize=1000204886016; sectorsize=512;         blocks=1953525168\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: PMBR at sector 0\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: Pri GPT at sector 1\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: GPT partition: type=C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B, start=40, size=409600\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: GPT partition: type=53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, start=409640, size=1671210848\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: GPT partition: type=426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, start=1671620488, size=1269760\ngpt show: /dev/disk1: Sec GPT at sector 1953525167                               \n     start          size  index contents                                        \n         0             1        PMBR                                            \n         1             1        Pri GPT header                                  \n         2            32        Pri GPT table                                   \n        34             6\n        40        409600      1 GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n    409640    1671210848      2 GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n1671620488       1269760      3 GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n1672890248     280634887\n1953525135            32        Sec GPT table\n1953525167             1        Sec GPT header\n\n\n*The free space on your HDD has 280634887 blocks.

AFAIK Recovery Partition Creator 3.8 will NOT create a Recovery HD on CoreStorage volumes.\n\n*After reinstalling the system with the latest available system installer open App Store and install the latest security fixes.\n\n\nA: Where did you fail? Where ever you could.\nThe disks are GPT. Windows thinks they are MBR. Apple/Microsoft set it up this way. This means you can not use anything from Microsoft to change the partitions on the disks. If changes are going to be made to the partitions, the software used must come from Apple. The only exception is windows can format partitions. Now while the Disk Utility and the Terminal can be used to change partitions, there is no reason to do so. You should be using Bootcamp to create or destroy the windows Bootcamp partition. Bootcamp knows what it is doing, you don't. \nIf you wish to know what MBR partition scheme windows views, enter the following commands in a terminal window:\nfdisk /dev/disk0\nfdisk /dev/disk1\n\nYour OS X HFS+ core storage partitions should have an id of AC. Windows partitions are type 07. The efi partition is type EE and the OS X recovery partition is type AB.\nI am not using core storage. I would tell you do to do the same, except with a fusion drive you have no choice. I have found, the OS X partition can not be resize unless it is done while OS X is running. This is the opposite of what I would have expected. Using the disk utility to resize the OS X boot partition while booted to a recovery partition for me has resulted in failure. However, resizing is possible for both Windows and OS X, if you remove them from their partitions, resize the partitions and then restore them back to their partitions.\nFYI, here is some info on Fusion drives: Mac mini (Late 2012 and later), iMac (Late 2012 and later): About Fusion Drive\n\nA: I had the same problem after an attempt to install Windows 8.1 on my fusion drive. That wouldn't work since windows refused to use the MBR type partition created by bootcamp. Yosemite was running ok, there was just a 300Gb unmovable free space block. I could have left it as it was, but I decided to reinstall Yosemite booting from a USB install drive. It took about 2 hours, after that everything was working again. No free space, no extra little partitions (there were 13 of them), and the recovery partition was present once more. I made a fresh time machine backup just in case, but I ended up not even have to use it. This is consistent with report that the installer is cable of repairing fusion drive issues.\n\nA: Since you are using El Capitan you can now do this:\nFrom the terminal execute\ndiskutil coreStorage delete lvgUUID\n\nThen exit terminal.\nStart disk utility.\nWhen it prompts you to fix the drive, say yes.  It will automatically rebuild the Fusion drive. \n", "Q: Screen Burn (Yosemite) When moving some dock icons around, I noticed screen burn, basically my old dock icons were burnt into the screen, is there a way of fixing this issue? I'm running on a MacBook Pro and Yosemite. Is the burning the type of thing that's going to disappear after a while?\n\nA: Something like this might help\n\nCreate an all-white screen in a graphics application such as\n  AppleWorks or Photoshop, and save it as a JPEG file.\nUse this as the image displayed by the screen saver.\nTurn the display brightness down (but not off) to preserve backlight\n  bulb life.\n\nLeave the white screen saver on for a while.\nor more simple, use the build in \"Flurry\" screen saver and let it run overnight.\n", "Q: Does Mac Pro late 2013 support HiDPI? I know for sure that Mac Pro late 2013 supports 4k screens flawlessly, but is HiDPI supported?\n\nA: My understanding is that when Apple is saying that a high DPI display is officially supported, they are implying that HiDPI mode  is supported.   See, for example, that in the article officially stating support for certain 4K displays for your Mac, they show a screenshot and state that you should be able to adjust scaling:\n\nE.g., the Dell monitor cited in the article is quite a high pixel density since it shows 4K in a 24 inch diagonal.  Running it without HiDPI would be quite challenging for most users.\n", "Q: SSD formating trouble and mysterious disks Two days ago suddenly Apple services started to fail on my Mavericks machine. I couldn't shut down (logind - or something like that - crashed but could not be force-quit). I shut down twice from terminal. Then I wanted to repair whatever is happening from recovery mode. I don't remember the message but the next thing I know it won't boot anymore.\nNow when I use the (internet recovery/DVD) disk utility I usually can't format the SSD (Samsung Evo 840). In these cases sometimes the drive disappears from the Disk Utility (also from Terminal, there's just no /dev/disk0 anymore). Restarting helps, though. Sometimes I can format but then my Time Machine hangs at deleting the disk when restoring. I also took the SSD out and did a long (not the short one) exFAT format on a windows machine.

When I give presentations it's using GoToMeeting, WebEx, etc., so I am trying to reproduce that behavior.\n\nA: Sure. Create a Keyboard Maestro macro that runs when the app launches and runs an AppleScript to turn DND on. \nThen create another one for when the app quits which runs another AppleScript to turn DND off.\nAppleScript can be found here: http://m.tuaw.com/2013/02/04/applescripting-notification-center-scheduling-do-not-disturb/\n", "Q: How do I do a COUNTIF on another table column in Numbers?

If you don't know how to do something then all you have to is start typing a formula and it will begin to auto populate, click on it and the functions sidebar will open with the function. it will give you examples, what the parameters are etc.\nThat's just a tip, but your lucky I'm here:\nSince you didn't specify what you want the cell of Table 1 to count in the column of table 2 I just counted all non-blank cells. You can alter with whatever text based of the countif function in the second example that compares against a string:\n1 : Table 1 Cell that stores number of cells in column A of Table 2. As described since you didn't specific I just counted all non-blank cells :\n=COUNTIF(Table 2::A,\"<>\"&\"\")\n\n2 : Table 1 Cell that stores number of cells in Column E of Table 2 that matches text \"MATCHED\" : \n=COUNTIF(Table 2::E,\"MATCHED\")\n\nInstead of typing you can just do this:\nType into the cell = then type COUNTIF then click on the column header (E) it will select the entire column, then click on condition and type \"MATCHED\" then press enter!

Click the Time Machine item in the menu bar at the top of your screen (it looks like a clock with an arrow running counterclockwise around it), and choose Enter Time Machine. Here, all of your saved backups will appear in chronological order. Use the visual timeline on the right side to scroll through your backups and look for specific items or folders.\nSelect the file or folder you want, and press the Restore button.

All external access has been shut off to this server.\nI have run Disk Utility and fixed permissions and I have re-installed Lion (not a clean install).\nThe only access I have is via afp to shared Public Folders.\nRunning commands in Terminal does not seem to be an option as I seem to be locked out of the main directory.\nIs there some way I can re-establish the normal login window?\n\nA: You can enter the username and password of the local administrator account at the login window you are seeing. The local administrator would be the user account that was created when first setting up OS X on the MacBook and is not associated with any network account server.\nOnce logged in to the local admin, open System Preferences, click on Users and Groups, unlock the preference pane, click on login options, and change \"Display login window as\" to \"List of Users\". You can also edit Network Account Server binding from the preference pane.\n\nA: \"Network Accounts unavailable\" is an indication that the device is unable to communicate with Directory Services (Open Directory).  \nYou need to make sure that you are on the same subnet as the server (the subnet that was used when the Open Directory was created as this seems to be a MacBook and mobile).  \nYou also need to make sure DNS is setup correctly (forward and reverse resolution of the IP address and full-qualified hostname of the server).  \n", "Q: Unable to Install apps onto my iPad (Stuck on \"waiting...\") For the past several days, I have been unable to install ANY apps onto my iPad.

I use my iPhone to wake me up for school in the morning. The one flaw in that workflow is that, as any student knows, snow day season is very much upon us. I also have an iPad (school-given and limited accordingly) and an MBP. iOS 8.1.2 (non-jailbroken) and OS X 10.1.1.\nIs there a way, using the devices at my disposal, to subscribe to a notification service (such as one of the news stations that sends text or email notifications about school delays/closings) and automatically have my alarms altered accordingly? i.e. If my school calls a 2-hour delay, I want my 6:15 alarm turned off and an 8:15 one turned on, and if they call a full-blown cancellation, I want all alarms off. Can it be done?\nIdeally, the device emitting the alarm would still be the iPhone that sits on my nightstand at night, but I guess I'd be willing to have the alarm on my computer if it's the only way.\n\nA: Look into IFTTT, specifically the weather recipes, this isn't something the iPhone can do out-of-the-box. Jailbroken, i'm sure, but unless a developer specifically creates an app for you, this isn't something the iPhone has implemented into it's core services. [That's why the App Store Universe is so relevant and massive]. In regards to you turning an alarm off or on pending a No-School alert, isn't probable across any mediums I would think. You could code something a computer before implementing this on an iPhone or iPad.  Here's the thing, even if developers developed an app, they have no control over core services, so the alarm app that ships with the device is untouchable to any developer outside of apple, they can't turn that on or off, Apple won't let them. They can alter, change, update or create alarms or anything within their own app bundle, but nothing outside of it while maintain App Store Guidelines and integrity using Public APIs. So your resources are limited here. I'm not saying it's impossible, what I am saying, is you should probably focus your efforts towards a more robust (customizable) option like a computer (your MBP). The first step you have to over come is receive an alert like that and handle it\n", "Q: Is it possible to extend the time i'm logged as administrator when enter sudo mode from the console? Is it possible to extend the time i'm logged as administrator when enter sudo mode from the console?\nIf yes, how?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible.\nEdit the sudoers file by typing the following at the command prompt:\nsudo visudo\n\nFind the section commented with # Defaults specification and look for a line like this:\nDefaults  env_reset\n\nChange that line to:\nDefaults  env_reset,timestamp_timeout=10\n\nWhere you can replace 10 with whatever the number of minutes you'd like for the sudo password to live. Save the changes and you're done.\nEdit: if you don't like to use vi you can tell visudo to use another editor. The editor must block until you're done with your edits. Just set the EDITOR environment variable before envoking visudo and it will use that editor instead:\nEDITOR=/usr/bin/nano sudo visudo\n\nwould use nano to edit the file instead. I recommend you do not use a graphical editor like Sublime Text without knowing how to run the editor, from the command line, in blocking mode (for subl that means calling it with --wait).\n\nA: In the terminal type this to open a file to edit:\nsudo visudo\n\nFind this:\nDefaults        env_reset\n\nAnd replace with this:\nDefaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=NUMBER\n\nWhere NUMBER is the number of minutes to time-out.\nThen save the file.\n\nA: sudo bash\nYou may now remain the root user for as long as you want.

If you do create a directory and edit fstab.\nNOTE you should use vifs, which requires a knowledge of vi commands, so you should look at man vi to discover the basic commands.\n :q! quits\n :wq saves \n  i to insert\n\n", "Q: How to stop Time Machine backing up log files inside application containers?

Result: I never managed to have my Unetbootin-formatted USB key appear on this screen :(\nI read some stuff about reFit ( http://refit.sourceforge.net ) and GParted, but I just don't know how to use them...\nIf someone managed to install Windows 7 on his/her iMac with Yosemite using a USB Key, please help me understand why I can't see the USB as a boot option.\n\nA: Found this on an apple forum. It'll allow you to create a bootable USB on older macs through boot camp without an optical disk. I used this method on my late 2011 mbp and I now have windows 8.1 pro running on it perfectly::\nBefore you do anything, make a backup of Info.plist or the whole Boot Camp Assitant app so that you can go back if necessary. Rename it something like \"Info old.plist\" or \"Original Boot Camp Assistant.\"\nFirst, edit the plist of Boot Camp Assistant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Applications/Utilities\n\n*Right click Boot Camp Assistant and view package contents\n\n*Find Info.plist in the Contents folder and edit it in Text Edit (it will make you duplicate the file first)\n\n*You want to edit FOUR things:\n\n*\n\n*Add your model to DARequiredROMVersions\n\n*Delete the word \"Pre\" from UEFIModels and add your model\n\n*Delete the word \"Pre\" from USBBootSupportedModels and add your model\n\n*Remove your model from Win7OnlyModels (if its there)\n\n\n\nTo add your model to these lines, just copy and paste an exsiting row and replace the data between the two  tags with your model code. You can find the right codes to use for the plist by going to Apple Menu > About This Mac > More Info > System Report. Use the \"Boot ROM Version\" and \"Model Identifier\" as appropriate in the plist.\n\n\n*Once you make these changes, save the file and replace the old Info.plist with your new one. It will ask you to type your password.\n\n\nThe last step is to do a code sign. Boot Camp Assitant will not run if it's been edited. You need to resign it. Open Terminal (use spotlight to find it) and type this:\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app\n\nIt will probably ask for your password. Then it will say you need to download a developer tool from Apple. Agree to download it. (You don't need to install the whole X-Code, if it asks.) Once its been installed (its automatic), you need to go BACK to Terminal and run that command again. This time it will work.\nAfter you've done that - open your hacked Boot Camp Assitant (it should run now) and have it make the Windows installation drive for you. Have the Windows ISO handy, and plug in a flash drive thats about 4-8 GB or more. The entire flash drive will be erased. This process can take a while. When its done, restart your mac and hold the option key. The USB drive that Boot Camp made for you will be there for you to install windows from. Its a yellow disk icon labeled EFI Boot.\n\nA: Has it occurred to anyone that the reason you can not boot is because you actually can't? The the iMac12,2 is listed as one of the PreUSBBootSupportedModels in the info.plist for BootCamp. The identifier iMac12,2 represents the 2011 iMac 27 inch model. Most likely the iMac models built before 2012 do not have firmware that supports booting windows from a USB port.\nYou watched a YouTube video that showed how to trick BootCamp into allowing the creation of the USB device. You probably succeeded. It probably works fine on 2012 or newer iMac.\n", "Q: Not possible to create a sparsebundle image on a SMB mounted Volume I'm trying to create a sparse bundle image from Disk Utility directly on my NAS (through a mounted smb volume):\n\nI then get the following error after a few seconds:\n\nCreating a sparseimage the same way works perfectly.\nI however wanted to go to a sparse bundle as the file is afterwards synchronized with Google Drive and sparsebundle are seen as folders and are then more sync-friendly.\nI'm on 10.10.1.\nInfo about the mounted volume:\n\n\nA: Support for Time Machine has been added to Samba in 2018, in 4.8.0 release:\n\nTime Machine Support with vfs_fruit\nSamba can be configured as a Time Machine target for Apple Mac devices\nthrough the vfs_fruit module.

S.M.A.R.T status shows no problem, nor does Disk Utility. \nFor the moment I'm happy to just move the file away and forget about it, it's not too big; however I can't imagine this would be good for spotlight and would like to repair the damage after the fact.\nWhat would be the best way to handle this situation?\n\nA: First: do you have a good backup? If not, make one before doing anything else. If you have one, make sure it's up to date (but don't delete the old backup history -- it's possible you'll run into other disk errors, and you don't want to overwrite your last good backup with a corrupted one). Multiple independent backups are also a good idea. Testing your ability to restore from it/them is very good idea.\nRead errors that make it through to the OS are a very bad sign for your drive's health. SMART will try to detect drive problems, but it doesn't always work (and Disk Utility doesn't really know how to interpret it very well), so not seeing any problem there doesn't mean there actually isn't a problem. I remember we had a drive come into our shop that sounded disturbingly like a coffee grinder when spun up, but the SMART status came back as verified. We replaced it.\nYour drive might run fine for quite a while... but I wouldn't count on it.\nOnce you have your backups in order, you can delete & rebuild the spotlight database with these commands:\nsudo mdutil -i off /\nsudo rm -Rf /.Spotlight-V100\nsudo mdutil -i on /\n\nIt'll ask for you admin password after the first command (note that it won't echo as you type). Be sure to type the second command very carefully. Anytime you see the rm command used with either sudo or -R, that's an indication you're doing something potentially dangerous and should make sure you know what you're doing; in this case it has both, so you should be really awake. For example, if you typed a space (instead of a period) between \"/\" and \"Spotlight-V100\", it would immediately set about erasing the entire volume. Did I mention you should make sure you have a good backup first?\n", "Q: Order e-mail by size Is it possible to sort iOS Mail.app by size?

I have a drive used only for Time Machine.\n\nThe drive is 3TB, with 1.75TB showing available, so TM actually has used only 1.25TB, yet the total reflects 50+ backups of 80GB each.\nThe question is - If I were to take one of these snapshots and copy it to another drive, will that file function as a TM backup? Or is that image a series of aliases and if the TM drive isn't there, this file will be useless? \n\nA: Yes - copying any of the folders will use the hard link to make a full copy of that moment in time. The hard links only work on the same filesystem, so you can test things if you are copying to the same volume but most instances where I do this, I'm copying to another volume (compressed disk image or physical/logical volume).\nIn a nutshell - using Finder (or rsync/ditto) to make a copy of any of the folders will result in a functional full copy of the system at that point in time with all the files intact.\n", "Q: Where does Thunderbird, on OSX, store its offline folders?

If you have a current, complete backup of the system, the easiest solution here is to boot to recovery mode, open Disk Utility and erase the partition. With a fresh file system in place, exit Disk Utility and proceed to restore from the TC backup.\nNote: If you have successfully backed up corrupted files, you will also successfully restore them. If the system continues to exhibit strange behaviour even when DU indicates no file system problems and hardware test is clear, you'll probably want to consider a fresh OS install and a profile/data/apps migration. (Within the last week, I went through this exact scenario courtesy of a corruption in the encrypted volume that made it unbootable.)\n", "Q: Will HFS+ extended attributes be lost on FreeNAS? I have FreeNAS server partially set up on an HP Microserver, but just realized that I may lose all my extended attribute metadata on the files that come from my Macs (which is what most of my computers are).  This metadata is somewhat important to me, so if FreeNAS will lose this data then maybe I need to rethink my strategy.\nI was going to use FreeNAS for both Time Machine backup and as a file server, so the metadata would be relevant in both cases.\nWill FreeNAS keep the metadata if I connect to it using AFP, or will it lose the metadata?\n\nA: FreeNAS supports the creation of AFP file shares for general use with OS X systems. For Time Machine backups, you need to make sure to specifically enable Time Machine support (Disk Discovery enabled and type set to Time Machine) on a particular AFP share you intend to use.\nFurther clarification:  AFP currently supports Unicode file names, POSIX and access control list permissions, resource forks, named extended attributes, and advanced file locking.\nFrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol\n", "Q: Find all hidden \".idea\" folders in system I am using PHPStorm 8 for programming.

English is my default, but in some applications such as Skype I use Russian. Every time I am switching from Skype to Safari I have manually switch back from Russian to English and this is annoying. How can I configure so that language switch is handled by operating system  automatically when I am changing windows? \nIn Keyboards->Input Sources I've ticked Automatically switch to a document's input source but it doesn't work, still if I've switched to Russian it will stay while I will change it again.\nI am on Yosemite 10.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Here's what I'm experiencing on El Capitán...\nThe key here is \"document's input source\" so when switching from Skype to Safari, if no document (web page in this case) has focus the input source will not change. If you then select, for example, a field on a page, the input source should change to whatever the last input source was when you were last in that document. So one application program can have multiple documents each with its own input source and the OS won't switch input sources until a specific document within the app has been selected.\nIf you open a new safari window or tab, the currently active input source will be used for that new \"document.\"\n\nA: The Automatically switch to a document's input source works, but not like you think it should. \nIt's intent is to switch the keyboard to input method you choose, which it does, however it only does it will the application is active. So your using Skype and you move over to Safari it will switch based on the documents input method, then you go back to Skype it will switch to Russian again, however once you quit Skype it will default back to your systems primary language. An alternative would be to click on the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar where it will display an icon and the languages you elect and choose from there as opposed to diving into System Preferences every time.\nSo Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources > Show Input Menu in Menu Bar\nThis is an alternative, as far as an autonomous option, someone who is well versed might be able to help you with a command line reference.

While under Win 7 however I quickly started running out of space for what I needed to do, as a quick solution I decided I would just merge my Kali partition with Win 7 to create more space.  Despite the fact that I had read before that resizing a Win 7 bootcamp partition was difficult and should not be done I proceeded (without thinking) to do so.  Upon reboot however I encountered the expected,\n\nError: No such partition.\n  Entering rescue mode\n  Grub Rescue >\n\nLuckily I am able to still boot into OS X by holding down the \"Option\" key on boot.  I have fixed this problem before by manually fixing the MBR table using the method described here --> http://jonsview.com/fixing-mbr-tables-on-imac-or-mbp-triple-boot-setups\nUnfortunately I have also erased my Windows 7 & Kali partitions as I was going to just start over from scratch using bootcamp and create a bigger windows partition so that guide is not as easy to follow since I only have my OS X partition left.\nMy Solution & Question:\nWhat I have decided would probably be the easiest course of action would be to backup my OS X partition, do a complete reformat and reinstall from back up.  However I would like to retain my system exactly as is with the two user accounts, all their settings and apps still installed and operational.  I am thinking cloning my partition would probably be the easiest but I am unsure as to how this would work with an encrypted OS X partition and if it would still retain the MBR error.  My current choices of action from what I can tell is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloning the partition\n\n*Migration Assistant\n\n*Time Machine Backup\n\n\nIf anyone could give me some ideas on which would be the best solution for me it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: In my opinion, Time Machine is the best solution. If you do a full restore from backup, all your configurations are retained. You'll need to enable FileVault after the restore is finished. If you do a nuke-n-pave and a pristine install, migrating profile data, apps and settings invariably misses some stuff, e.g., VPN configurations, automatic wifi connections, current RVM environment, 3rd-party printer drivers, etc.\nIf you repartition the drive and lose the local recovery partition, internet recovery will be slow; as such, you may wish to download your OS X version from the App Store and use DiskMaker X to create a bootable installation USB or DVD from which to proceed. Note that a local recovery partition is not created unless you do the actual OS installation first, which'll burn a good 30 minutes of your day. After that, you can reboot to the USB and head into the restore process.\n", "Q: Problems connecting to VPN on iOS 8 w/ OS X Server VPN Alright, so about a few hours ago I purchased OS X Server, being intrigued by it's VPN capabilities. I enabled VPN and set it up, however I'm unsure if I even did this correctly. I'm pretty sure I've set it up incorrectly or the information I'm putting in my connection on my iPhone 6 (Settings>General>VPN) is incorrect.\nI'm unsure of what the \"Account\" and \"Password\" fields are. I put in the account name and password used to log into my computer (not the \"Full Name\", the one that appears in the home (terminal command: open $HOME -r ) directory) and it still isn't working.\nI keep getting this error when trying to connect:\nVPN Connection\nThe L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.\nWell, I am the Administrator so I'm lost there. Basically I need some kind of tutorial that assumes I'm a full on retard. I've asked multiple friends of mine that were keen Apple users and searched around on Google for more than hour and I couldn't find anything that could help in my situation.\n\nA: Setting up VPN isn't necessarily as straight forward as one would hope. The first issue is how to pass the connection from your router to the OS X Server. That is done via port forwarding in the router to your server's static (or reserved DHCP) IP address inside the network.\nTo make the connection work, you need to know your WAN IP address. If you're using dynamic IP addressing with your internet service provider, you need to have some means of updating DNS any time your IP address changes. DynDNS is such a service (there are others).\nOnce you've got DNS and port forwarding happening, then you'll be able to determine whether OS X Server and or or iDevices are configured correctly by carefully noting any successful connections vs. authentication failures.\nGoogle/YouTube have a large number of videos regarding the configuration of VPN on OS X Server. They may prove useful to you.\n", "Q: How to fix com.apple.dock.extra? I'm a gamer and one day  i was playing mine craft when this blabbering thing just showed up.

Reset the SMC if you can (Shift+Control+Option+Power while plugged in, then press power again after releasing all keys.) But if that doesn't work, it's either the SATA controller, the connection to the drive, or the drive. At that point, it's a store visit.\n\nA: For future reference incase anyone else hits this issue, I took the laptop in and the resolution is mechanical. The hard drive cable has to be replaced.

It still does, but I just need some more space for Guild Wars 2 (which is around 17 GB since the last time I checked).\nToday, I checked my storage status, and it was around 412 GB.  I looked around for some heavy-weight stuff, and I found Recovered Items (probably from that problem during the installation process) which is 26.31 GB.  Huge, yes?  Very...\nAnyway, in that folder are 3 more (1 is an alias for /Users), and the other 2 are Library and System.  I suspect these 2 folders must be from Mavericks.  So, I'm wondering, is it 100% safe to delete this monster?\nP.S: When I moved the Users alias to the trash, I checked its info again, it said the original is located in /Users/(username)/.Trash/Users.

When apps get updated, little blue dots appear next to the app name in iOS 8.1 (and some earlier versions as well).  This is just a pet peeve, but those blue dots annoy me.  For example, if I update 10 apps, I have to open each of those ten apps to make the blue dots go away, which is a pain.\nIs there any way to disable the blue dots so they don't appear for new/updated apps?\n\nA: There currently is no way for you to disable this as of <=iOS8 and within the boundaries of factory OS.

I'm pretty sure it's the hard drive that's slow, because I have tried to reinstall OS X, but booting, loading applications, etc. is still slow.\nThe first thing I thought of was getting an SSD (probably using one of those optical drive replacement kits) and I figured this would help to speed up booting and loading applications.\nBut the other problem is, since it only has 4GB of RAM, I often use a lot of it. I like to have safari open a lot of the time and it uses a lot of memory. However, the \"memory pressure\" in activity monitor is usually OK. Also, my thinking is that with an SSD, the RAM might not matter so much since the swap would be faster.\nWould the speed of the SSD make up for the lack of RAM? What would you suggest?\n\nA: I had installed on my MBP mid 2010 a Samsung SSS 830 250GB. \nWith SSD you will solve all the problems caused by HD latency and speed (in my case speed up is around 10x). \nOf course you also take advantages on speed when you use swap memory with an SSD. It's like when you write and read something from a disk.\nIn summary, if you want a huge speed up go for an SSD.\nI think the best SSD) now is the Samsung 850 Pro 256GB  (storage / price. \nRAM upgrade is required only if you do intensive computation / gaming / image or video editing. \n\nA: It sounds like the original poster solved his problem by switching to an SSD (hooray!). But it may also help others to know that a common issue with 2012 MacBook Pro's is that the hard drive cable can start to fail which causes extreme slowness within OS X. A simple replacement of the cable has helped significantly for a few people in this scenario.\nSee this thread for the details: Ridiculously slow MacBook Pro\n", "Q: iPad not charging I have reviewed the comments already posted about an unresponsive screen on my iPad air. \nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turned itself off and won't turn back on\n\n*Been on charge for an hour still no response.

There are tutorials out there that can guide you through the process to limit the iOS 8 catastrophe you might have heard about. People had to delete apps, photos, music etc just to download the new iOS because it required 4.6GB of free space to download even though iOS8 isn't actually 4.6GB or even close to it. \nSo the question is relative, your not really losing space, although you kind of are losing space. You have to have a certain amount just to download to the device, but the ostracized disk space not taken up after the install can once again be used to hold your apps, music etc that you deleted prior to the download. The decompressed version of the update will be deleted once the process is complete. \nMy recommendation : Forego all of this plug it up to your computer download/install from iTunes.\n", "Q: Can't change startup disk iMac Here is my situation: I've only the mouse paired with my iMac because I rent the keyboard to a friend.

Youd do this by making a copy of this dialog without the \"default answer\" part, and removing the \"giving up after 8\" part from the original, then putting the copy before the original, and putting this if statement around the original:\nif button returned of dialogResult is \"Reply\" then\n\nAnother thing you could do with the dialog box, that i'm pretty sure you cant even do with the imessage notification, is control it with the keyboard. When a dialog box with a textbox appears, you can start typing immediately, press enter to send, and press esc at any moment.\nIf you're set on using a notification, unfortunately the notification section of the applescript documentation totally suggests that its not possible (with applescript). According to it, you cant even return one of two values let alone let the user enter a string.\n]1\nIf you could get 2 answers from it, though, id suggest having one button cancel button and another button that gets the text from your clipboard.

Decided to give it a go System Wide now in 2015 running Yosemite. I fancy it so far, certainly looks better and performs better as opposed to Lion (which should be the case) There are a few customizable options when you 'Enable Advanced Commands' like open file, run workflow, open application, paste text, paste data, & keyboard shortcut. \nHowever, call me lazy but it's still something that matters to me, I frequent Netflix & Hulu and other websites at minimum 4 times a day. I would like to add a functional command that will automatically open a webpage correlating to that command. since open file is different than run file, i'm trying to autonomously open Safari + the name of the website in URL form with dictation? The good thing about this is it automatically makes whatever application you reference the front-most window. So coding should be minimal, and I really don't want to create a service for this [my services are growing, currently at +55 in total]. \nI am an Automator aficionado however, and well versed with it so I'm using the Dictation Command tool, but what i am not, is an AppleScript scholar. After reading through the applescript library for about 60 minutes i finally figured out how to open a new window of Safari, activate the application in case it was not open and launch the url:\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        make new document with properties {URL:\"http://netflix.com\"}\nend tell\n\nAdditionally, I have 3 monitors. I always have movies, tv etc played on Number 2! I tried putting Safari in the monitor 2 screen with applescript but as an iOS developer, in good conscience am too embarrassed to share my code, it's sloppy . Can anyone lead me in the right direction? Or does anyone know a more simplified way around all of this? I really want this to work. I am in the military so our rooms aren't that big so my 2nd monitor (27\") is my tv, so I have created an iPhone app for my needs only that strictly simulates the double fn press needed to activate Dictation so I can watch tv from my bed [don't have apple tv].\n\nEDIT: My main goal is to be able to use voice activation to populate a Safari specific website using Dictation for a specific monitor. I don't want to sacrifice my 'Spaces' or 'Mission Control' settings as I have done a lot of work to make those beneficial to my workflow. I have 3 monitors, which are set up in succession (i.e, monitor 1 & 3 are right next to one another on my desk station, monitor 1 is left & 3 is right, monitor 2 is no where near 1 or 3 it is facing my bed see pic 1 for reference. However, they are set up in succession 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3. I have spaces set up where specific apps use monitor number 3 exclusively (Xcode) which doesn't make it as much of a hassle as it sounds, this is why i don't want to sacrifice my spaces settings because I use 2 as my dedicated \"TV\", this isn't that big of a deal though and can be changed, I don't even know why I do this, but it works so I haven't really bothered to try anything else) \nPIC 1:\n\n\nmiken32's suggestion works, but only to display it, not to minimize. Minimizing is important, because I will have to minimize the active Safari website, lets say Hulu, just to open Netflix because full-screen apps can't overlap. So I will inevitably do another voice activation or otherwise to minimize so I can transfer websites without blimps. Note: sometimes I don't want to close, sometimes I save my spot so minimizing is a good resource for me. This is what happens with miken32: it minimizes but I think it's trying to go back the origins we set in the script, but negatively as in (-). NOTE: I know the origins you see in the applescript of the movie don't reflect the absolute origin for my specific monitor, I changed the origins for testing, but for recording the movie I had to put it on that screen so I kept it as is just so you can see where it goes when you minimize. Other than that works great for the amount of code!. I'm glad you guys included the full screen option even when I didn't ask for it, that's absolutely what I had in mind but didn't want to disturb anyone trying to figure that out, my main goal was just getting it on the 2nd monitor.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jvmtnhh30hqmd36/answer1.mov?dl=0\n\nmarkhuntes answer works flawlessly, the amount of time it took to load on the first run was about 15 seconds, nothing to worry about, but definetly not optimal for every day use, however, subsequent runs were minimal (3-6 seconds max). What I do like about his suggestion is that it automatically finds the second monitor instead of me having to hard code it, which is great from a consumer point of view, the less I have to tamper with the better, this is a great feature for the future, say I change my set-up or I get a different sized monitor etc I don't have to re-code an absolute origin. There is a drawback as of now, I'm going to play around with it for a couple of days just to make sure its not conflicting with my other system preferences. It minimizes where it should which is great, it populates accurately but i've found if Safari is already the front-most application it (sometimes, more precisely, rarely, it populates in the same Space or (monitor 1) that Safari is already active. The reason I wanted it to show specifically in Monitor 2 is because of course I don't just use Safari in that monitor alone. Again, it could be my settings, I have a lot of hot corners and mission control keys and spaces preferences set up so I'm going to tinker with it just to make sure its not me and get back to you\n\nA: This script in an Automator Dictation command seems to work.\nNot the fullscreen will not work properly if run in Automator or Script editor.

Is there a way I can do it on my phone or laptop or is the only option is blunt deleting all dialogs?\nPlease don't suggest deleting other apps\n\nA: It is not possible to order messages by size on your phone. On your computer, it may be doable with a little Finder footwork. \nHowever, since it appears that you are running iOS 8, I suggest that you select to only keep messages for 30 days. If you open the Settings.app, navigate to Messages, then \"Keep Messages\" there are three options there with the shortest being 30 days. You may find this allows a good enough balance of your space. \nAlso, the messages are automatically sorted by date, so you could manually delete the oldest threads which are automatically taking up space while not being used much. In addition, if there are any threads that you know (some use texts in a similar style to social media or iCloud photos) have many pictures, those should be the first to go. \n", "Q: How could passwords on OSX keychain for one user end up in another?

How is this possible?\nTo clarify exactly what's going on let's define some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBooks\n\n*\n\n*Home-macbook\n\n*Husband-work-macbook\n\n\n*Apple/iTunes accounts\n\n*\n\n*Wife-apple-account\n\n*Husband-apple-account\n\n\n*OSX users on home-macbook\n\n*\n\n*Wife-osx-user (uses Wife-apple-account)\n\n*Husband-osx-user (uses Husband-apple-account)\n\n\n*OSX users on work-macbook\n\n*\n\n*Employee-osx user (uses Husband-apple-account)\n\n\n\nSo this is what happened exactly:  On Home-macbook, logged in as Wife-osx-user, we could see passwords in the KeyChain Access program that were only ever used on work-macbook as Employee-osx.\nNow if Employee-osx passwords showed up on Home-macbook when logged into Husband-osx-user, that could make some sense.  But why are the passwords being shared between users?  Are they linked through OSX somehow and can I turn that off?\nOne important note is that this home-macbook was recently upgraded from Snow Leopard to Yosemite.\nUpdate\nWhen I delete these passwords from the KeyChain Access app, they almost immediately are re-added automatically!  How can I stop this?!\n\nA: The problem is that I have logged into Chrome under wife-osx-user.  Chrome saves passwords into keychain.   And then keychain makes those available to Safari.  Not AT ALL the desired behavior but I suppose it makes some sense.\n", "Q: Two value-based axis for chart in Numbers 3.5 I am trying to achieve a chart in Numbers 3.5 where both axis scale linearly.\nRight now, my chart looks like this:\n\nObviously, I want the x-axis to scale because the 100.000 bytes message is MUCH larger than the 10.000 bytes message, and the current chart is misleading.\nI can't find a way to do this - the x-axis is always labeled as a \"Category\" instead of a \"Value\". Any way to achieve this?\n\nA: Took me a while, but I figured it out: The solution is to choose a scatter plot instead of a line chart.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Insert -> Chart -> 2D Scatter\n\n*Select the chart, then select Add Chart Data:\n\n\n*Now simply select your entire table, including the x axis. Numbers will figure out the rest and automatically select your leftmost column as the x-axis.\n\n\n*Finally, to make it look like a line chart, select the chart, then select the \"Axis\" tab in the inspector Chose Data Symbols: None and Connection Lines: Straight.\nResult:\n\n", "Q: Unable to fix permissions I have a Mac Mini 2006 and I accidentally set one of the permissions to No Access and so now the OS X will not boot up. ⌘ Cmd+R and ⌘ Cmd+S will not work. All I can do is hold the Opt and choose what to boot to.\nI also do not have a Recovery partition. I made a Snow Leopard USB and when I try to repair permissions and verify permissions it straight up fails, but if I repair the HD that works.\nHow can I repair my computer?\n\nA: If you have access to other Mac, you can boot yours in target mode. Attach it to the other system. It should show up as an external drive on the other system. From there, you can either fix the permission, or reload your operating system.\nIf you don't have access to another computer, you may want to ask around for a USB drive that has a system installed.

I've disabled display mirroring as I want to use the extra space to view another window, however I want the items on the desktop of both screens to be the same.\nIs it possible to mirror the desktop to both screens in this way?\n\nA: No, as the second monitor is an extension of your desktop. An empty extension.\n\nThe mirroring would obviously give you the same desktop items on both monitors, but without the extra screen estate that you wish for. By desktop items, I assume you mean the dock and the file icons on the actual desktop.\nYou seem to want a hybrid of both modes, and unfortunately you can not do this. Also, it would lead to a rather confusing situation as you you would end up having duplicates of the same files on, what is effectively, the same desktop space.\nI must admit though, the first time I connected a second monitor to a mac, I had expected two docks, one on each screen. But it just doesn't work like this.\nI hope that this helps to explain it.\n\nA: Unfortunately the only way you would be able to \"mirror\" the items on the desktop over both displays (without actually Mirroring the displays) is to create aliases for those items and place them on the second display manually.\n\n", "Q: Can I prevent Chrome from storing passwords in Keychain, instead just save it to itself? Can I set up Chrome to not store passwords in the Keychain?\nI'd like to be able to use Chrome as my browser on her Macbook, without having my passwords shared into Safari and Firefox (which she uses).  That's how we've shared this computer for a long time (which means I don't have to bother logging out fully and logging in as my own account), and since upgrading to Yosemite it has changed behavior here.\n\nA: Open Chrome then on the right site click on\nClick the Chrome menu Chrome menu on the browser toolbar.\nSelect Settings.\nClick Show advanced settings.\nUnder the \"Passwords and forms\" section check the \"Offer to save your web passwords\" checkbox if you want Google Chrome to prompt you to save your password every time you sign in to a new website.\nOpen your KeyChain and find the Google/Chrome passwords that you do not want to share. Open and select Access control. Now use one of the available options to your desire (to share or not).\n", "Q: Share Desktop folders between admin and managed accounts? I'm thinking of trying to minimize distractions while doing homework by locking myself in an account managed by self-inflicted parental controls. My problem is, I don't want to not have access to my school files while I'm in the admin account. How can I give both accounts access to my school folders while keeping the convenience of having them on both accounts' desktops? (i.e. I'd very much like to not go to the Public folder every single time.)\nEarly 2011 MBP, OS X 10.10.1.\nEDIT: Also a viable option, if anyone knows how to make it happen: A way to turn self-inflicted parental controls on and off at will despite being an admin.\n\nA: From the either account but preferably the admin account ( I will assume you are in the Admin account) you can go to the users folders.\nPart 1,\nSelect the the managed account home folder.\nuse cmd + i to get the info panel for the folder.\nAt the bottom you will see the allowed access to the folder.\nThis should show read & write for that user, and no access for everyone.\nClick the padlock and enter your admin details.\nNow click the + button and either choose your Admin account name.\nThe admin account should now be added to the list.\nNow change its access to read & write.\nYou should now from the Admin account be able to open the managed user account's folder but not any folder inside.\nYou now have a choice.  Depending on what you want.\nPart 2\nIf for example you want only to access the Documents folder and all the files and folders enclosed. Then repeat the process above Part 1 for the documents folder.\nBut this time, in the info panel for the documents folder, after you have completed the above Part 1 on it. You will see a action button (Cog) at the bottom of the panel below the list.\nClick the button and then the Apply to enclosing items…\nWhen you confirm, all the items in Documents folder will replicate the access given to the Documents folder.\nOr you can do the above by drilling down to only the folders you are interested in using Part 1 and the final folder in that chainPart 1 & Part 2\nOr of cause you can just do chainPart 1 & Part 2 on the home folder.\nBut I personally would just do the folders I need.\n", "Q: If OS X doesn't use the X Server, then what does it use? What is the window server on OS X? \n\nA: It uses Quartz. But that's a bit of a marketing term in so much as there is not one single thing called Quartz, but a group of things that work together to make the system called Quartz. Specifially, Quartz encompasses the set of systems needed to do rendering (Quartz 2D), font management, graphics card interaction (Quartz Compositor), OpenGL support, 3D acceleration and what not.\nThe Quartz Compositor is the piece of the Quartz bundle that provides the server and window compositing and management features normally performed by the XServer and XClient pair.\nAn addendum to this question might be: why didn't Apple just use X11 and the X Server?\nAnd there's a great answer to that addendum question on Slashdot from one of the primary Quartz developers:\n\nWhat Apple is providing is an Apple-original window system that is\n  graphics model agnostic, as well as a vector drawing system that maps\n  very well to PDF, which is a sort of PostScript without the\n  non-graphical operators. This is packaged under the name 'Quartz' for\n  easy reference by Marketing types.\nThe window system is designed to support both buffered (like an\n  offscreen PixMap) and unbuffered windows, and is graphics model\n  agnostic, working equally well with QuickDraw, OpenGL, the Quartz\n  drawing engine, X11, and third party solutions, and managing window\n  geometry for the Classic, Carbon, and Cocoa environments. The server\n  portion is a hybridization of screen arbiter and compositor models\n  (and if that's all Geek to you, don't worry about it).\nThe Quartz drawing engine supports drawing primitives similar to the\n  graphics primitives that might be found in the DPSClient\n  single-operator primitives library for X and NeXTSTEP. There are no\n  math and flow control primitives, as these can be done more\n  efficiently in the native compiled code. There are no DPS or PS\n  wrappers, as this optimization for server-side graphics is not needed\n  in the Quartz client-side graphics model.\nThe operations provide imaging and path construction and filling\n  operations as well as some interesting other bits that map well into\n  the direction that 2D drawing is headed. (See Longhorn, or the X\n  raster projects.) The drawing engine can output to rasters (like a\n  window!), as well as PS and PDF streams to feed printers. The Mac OS X\n  printing system takes advantage of the capabilities of Quartz to\n  support all sorts of printers, and make the life of printer driver\n  developers much, much easier.\nThings we'd need to add/extend in X Window software\n  (protocol+server+manager+fonts+...):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Extend font server and services to vend outlines and antialiased\n  masks, support more font types, handle font subsetting.\n  \n*Extend\n  drawing primitives to include PS-like path operations.\n  \n*Add\n  dithering and phase controls.\n  \n*Add ColorSync support for drawing and\n  imaging operations, display calibration \n  \n*Add broad alpha channel\n  support and Porter-Duff compositing, both for drawing in a window and\n  for interactions between windows. \n  \n*Add support for general affine\n  transforms of windows \n  \n*Add support for mesh-warps of windows\n  \n*Make\n  sure that OpenGL and special video playback hardware support is\n  integrated, and behaves well with all above changes.\n  \n*We find that\n  we typically stream 200 Mb/sec of commands and textures for\n  interactive OpenGL use, so transport efficiency could be an issue.\n  \n  \n  So, yes, it looks like we can use X for Quartz. All we need do is\n  define extensions for and upgrade the font server, add dithering with\n  phase controls to the X marking engine, add a transparency model to X\n  imaging with Porter-Duff compositing support, make sure GLX gets in,\n  upgrade the window buffering to include transparency, mesh warps, and\n  really good resampling, and maybe augment the transport layer a bit.\nUmmm... There doesn't appear to be much code left from the original X\n  server in the drawing path or windowing machinery, and it doesn't\n  appear that apps relying on these extensions can work with any other X\n  server. Just what did we gain from this?\nOh, yeah. My mom can run an xterm session on her desktop now without\n  downloading the Apple X11 package, a shareware X server or buying a\n  software package.\nBeen there, evaluated that.\n\n", "Q: How to maximize file transfer speeds? We're trying to transfer large files from NY to LA, from one Mac to another.\nBoth sites have 100/100 mbps internet. Both report full speed at www.speedtest.net.\nBut we've tried AFP, SMB and SFTP, and can't get it to go any faster than 20mbps.\nTested with iperf -- with parallel connections got up to 16-20 mbps.\nHowever, we are doing this over a LogMeIn Hamachi VPN. Does that throttle/limit the speed?\n\nA: Using lftp with sftp and pget -cn10 I was able to get the transfer up to 99 mbps!\n", "Q: copy address from email search window I often have to find email addresses using the 'search' window in OSX mail.\nThe search function will frequently find an address for someone, and show it in the popup window below the search window.\nBut it often fails to find the underlying message, so I cannot open an actual existing message from the person.\nAnd, I cannot copy from the popup window, so I can see the address I need, on my screen, but I have to write it down, and repaste it into the message I am composing.\nThis is beyond ridiculous.\nIs there a solution?\n\nA: When you search for an email address in the OSX Mail search bar, if you select the address from the dropdown, the mail app will automatically add the option From: in front of the email address in the search bar. Thus, the mail messages that show up in the left mail list will change so that only emails from the selected email address are displayed.\nIf you do not have any messages that are actually From: the email address selected, no emails will be displayed in the list. You may need to change the From: option in the search bar to Entire Message in order to see messages where a certain email address was CC'ed or if it was written in the email message text.\n", "Q: open  opening finder window I use zsh. For some reason, with zsh, when I type open <TAB> (which should list the files to autocompletion), it opens Finder in the current folder.\nI don't have anything aliased for that. I didn't change any config recently. I don't have any idea about why this is happening. Bash works, though.\nAny ideas on how can I fix or debug that?\n\nA: I can not reproduce this issue, so it should not happen by default. TAB works as expected in zsh (as in bash). What version of OSX are you using? This is in a standard terminal window right? Do you have something in your .zshrc file relating to custom completion settings?\nTry deleting your .zshrc file and run the zsh shell again,\nmv .zshrc .zshrc.old\nzsh\n\nThis should fix your issue.\n\nA: You can enable debug mode in ZSH using the -vx flags.\nOpen up terminal, and create a new ZSH instance:\nzsh -vx\n\nThen, try your \nopen <tab>\n\nIt should print out everything it's trying to match on, and any processing it's doing.

Recently started using Photoshop and Lightroom, which take up a ton of space. I was thinking of moving my entire iPhoto to the Seagate to free up space. Is this possible? If so, how would I go about it?   \n\nA: iPhoto was built with this sort of flexibility in mind: it is possible and in fact iPhoto makes it quite easy. \n\n\n*\n\n*Find your iPhoto library. You'll most likely find it in your Pictures folder. If it's not there, open iPhoto while holding the option key, and you should get a window similar to the one below. The path to your library is displayed under the library selection box.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Move your library to the external hard drive. \n\n*Open iPhoto with the option key pressed to open the library selection window I talked about in Step 1. Hit the Other Library... button, and find the library on your external hard drive. Pretty easy!\nProtips: \n\n\n*\n\n*The last library you opened becomes your \"default\" library. That's the one iPhoto opens automatically when you don't press option. If that library isn't available, say your external HDD is not connected, the library selection window will open automatically and list the libraries it can find. \n\n*I keep a library in my computer, but every year or so, when it gets\ntoo full, I move it to an external hard disk.

Full permissions would look like this: -rwxrwxrwx.\nThe permissions are specified using binary notation. 1 means the permission should be set, and 0 means it should not be.\nThus, setting chmod 644 sets permissions 6 - or 110 in binary - for the file owner, and 4 - or 100 in binary - for the group and for everybody else.\nThis creates the permission string -110100100. This translates to: -rw-r--r--.\nNote that in your question above, the username.conf and Owner.conf both do have permissions of 644.\n", "Q: How in the world do you remove an action in iAd producer?

I've tried using iBooks, but I cannot annotate there on a pdf like I can an ePub. \nIf there isn't a way to do this out of the box, does anyone have a favorite third party solution?\n\nA: As limited as it is, but just for annotations, Adobe Reader for iDevices does support most (if not all) annotation types.\nOther PDF viewers support annotations as well, and if you want to have more functionality, particularly when it comes to PDF forms, you might look at PDFExpert by Readdle.\n", "Q: How do I get Chrome-like tab switching shortcuts in Safari [pre-version 9.0]? I much prefer the way Chrome allows me to use ⌘+# key to switch directly to an open tab.

Since I don't have any it didn't prompt anything on my end. But again, all menu title keyboard short cuts can be altered with no work at all in the keyboard shortcut area in system preferences. So looks like you can use your Command + 1-9 buttons\n\nA: I installed https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL, and then installed https://github.com/rs/SafariTabSwitching\n\nA: The newest version of safari (9.0) seems to support this out of the box.\n\nA: I found this very old blog post that lead me to a solution to this problem. You can use AppleScript like this to tell Safari to change to a specific tab:\ntry\n    tell front window of application \"Safari\" to set current tab to tab 3\non error\n    tell front window of application \"Safari\" to set current tab to last tab\nend try\n\nSo if you create nine of these scripts, one for each h⌘+# key combination from 1 to 9, you have the beginnings of a solution. All you need is a way to bind these scripts to shortcut keys.\nThe blog posts suggests saving each of these scripts in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari and then using a Safari plugin called FastScripts (the \"Lite\" version is free but limits you to ten script <-> shortcut pairings) to bind the key combinations ⌘+1 through 9 to each of the nine AppleScripts we created. The combinations should be set to only work when Safari is the active application.\nNow you've got sane, Chrome-like keyboard shortcuts for fast tab access in Safari.\n", "Q: Does anyone know the name of this tool on Mac OS? \nThis looks like a file browser but I don't know name of the tool.

I don't want to have an inbox for these secondary emails (I've got them on my primary anyway) but I want to be able to send from those addresses. I've tried adding my secondary account as usual, and then disabling it. But then I can't see that address' SMTP server to send from when sending. If I enable it, I can see it, but its mailbox automatically comes back. How can I have no mailbox for a mail account, but still be able to select its SMTP server to send mail from that address?\n\nA: In short, you can't accomplish what you're trying to do. In order to send/reply from a given address, you have to have that account set up and active in Mail.\nWithout the account being active, the address you wish to use is not available. And setting up an SMTP server entry for the other account(s) will not bypass the primary issue since you would only be using any alternate SMTP server as a relay for the account you're using to send the email - it will not rewrite the sending account address. For example, I have email forwarded from a generic \"info@\" account to a personal account on the same domain, but I can't reply with or send from the \"info@\" account address since I don't have that account set up in Mail.\n\nA: As mentioned by @douggro this isn't really doable. But as a workaround, you can setup a dummy POP3 account that will never receive any mail and then uncheck \"Include when automatically checking for new messages\".\nSo the question becomes, how to get a dummy POP3 account. At first I tried a Gmail account with POP3 enabled. But OS X tries to be smart and does a bunch of things with Gmail accounts that cause it to present a login webpage all the time.\nHowever, I found this awesome service called MailTrap.io which gives you one free \"testing\" inbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*So go to https://mailtrap.io/ and click signup in the top right.\n\n*You can use your Google Account or Github Account to signup quickly.\n\n*Then you will be taken to a testing inbox where you will see a POP3 username and password.\n\n*Enter all those credentials into Mail.app (be sure to check \"Allow insecure authentication\") and, importantly, for the outgoing mail server, use your custom SMTP (I like Mailgun and Mandrill for my custom domain).\n\n\nAll this is free. You should see an empty mailbox in Mail but just ignore that and send and receive mail as normal.\n", "Q: Edit the descriptive name of an email address displayed in Mail When entering an email address into the To: field of Mail, usually the full name of the recipient is displayed instead of the actual address.

One way to do that is via \"System Preferences\" -> \"Internet accounts\" -> select your account and then click on the \"Details\" button\n\nI think those descriptive names comes from either a contact or some previous emails in the Mail app.\nClick the '+' sign at the end of the \"To:\" field and (in the popped-up search field) start typing the email address as you would before.\nCheck the results there.\nIf nothing is found again, then try typing the \"Holidays in Italy\" and see if it finds something.\n\nThe options above are mostly a way to find why this is happening.\nIf you just want to remove the description every time:\n\n\n*\n\n*click on the little arrow next to \"Holidays in Italy\" \n\n*select \"Edit Address\"\n\n\nYou can also select \"Show Contact Card\" (if available) to check things.\nAnother option could be \"Remove from Previous Recipients list\".

Do you mean the URL bar (also known as Awesome bar ) ?\nIf yes, then the described behavior is expected. The Awesome bar get its results from \"bookmarks, history and tabs\".\nSo if you want to remove urls that you previously typed, you have to clear your browser's history.\n\nOn the other hand, if you mean the actual search-bar:\n \nThen right click on it and select \"Clear Search History\" or select the option you mention in the question.\nOn the image above the \"stack\" word is a search I have previously done.

When I'm done syncing, I get a message saying my ipod cannot be ejected because some of the files are being used by another source.  Somehow I think some of the files from the external hard drive got downloaded onto the internal hard drive.  I'm not super computer literate but I really don't remember doing anything other than moving the file from the external hard drive to iTunes.  Why is this happening and what do I do to fix it?\n\nA: When you add the music to iTunes to put on your phone, you're importing it into iTunes. If you import music into iTunes, it will get stored on your internal HD. ITunes has its own folders on your computer containing all of your files. \n", "Q: How can I find all *old* Keynote presentations on my computer? I have some old Keynote presentations.

Somewhere after Lion (from which I upgraded to 10.10), Apple has changed the shortcut to show/hide the toolbar in Preview from ⌘-B to ⌘-I, at least it says so in the menu entries.\n But when actually using the shortcut, what pops up is (as one would expect), the info window. \n\nCan someone explain why they would change it (probably not a constructive question), or whether this is a bug and how to rectify this and get the old behaviour back? Can this be done with assigning custom keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: This is not a bug, although I can certainly see why it looks like one. That little symbol is a pipe ( | ), not the letter I. The pipe is the upper character on the backslash ( \\ ) key.\nSo to type ⌘-|, the physical keys you need to press are: ⌘-Shift-\\.\nThe difference between \"|\" and \"I\" was more pronounced back when Lucida Grande was the system font (in fact, this very post is set in Lucida Grande; you can see how the pipe is taller and thinner than the uppercase I). But OS X Yosemite switched the system font to Helvetica, and unfortunately the \"|\" and \"I\" now look basically identical.\n\nA: As @daGUY spotted it is a pipe \"|\" symbol.\nBut you can change it to the old short cuts.or any other that does not clash, by using the keyboard shortcuts in system Preference -> App Shortcuts.\nBut note: I could not get it to pick up if I assigned new shortcuts to Preview.app (Show Toolbar & Hide Toolbar ).\nIn the end I assigned the ⌘ + B for both to All Applications  which Preview.app picked up\n\nA: This is probably a bug, or you've changed it yourself. Report to Apple and look with them.\nYou can change this by going to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Application Shortcuts and add what you want, you will have to type the exact thing such as \"Show Toolbar\".\nI can't see for myself if it's a mistake on Apples part because I'm using Swedish on my OS X.\n", "Q: What keeps waking my Mac up from sleep?

It is running OS X Mavericks - the IT department here at work states that I can't upgrade the system to Yosemite due to some \"open directory related integration issues.\" But I was given the green light to install Windows 8.1 in Boot Camp.\nI performed the installation as normal. Boot Camp prepared my USB drive from our company provisioned ISO image, installed Windows to the partition, and the Windows OOBE ran. Immediately after, the Apple Boot Camp installer appeared so I allowed it to complete. Upon rebooting after installing Boot Camp, the system can no longer load Windows. A blue screen with the \":(\" symbol appears every time. \nIt flashes by fast enough that I can't recover any information from it. I have found extremely limited information about this, but one post suggests that it is a KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK exception - sounds like an unsigned driver was installed (?)\nIs there something I am missing? This seems very un-Apple. Windows 8.1 has been out for long enough that it should be pretty well supported by now, or at least I'd think. The machine is new enough, and even though the Mac OS side is a bit old, the Windows partition shouldn't be affected by this.\nAnyone have any advice?\n\nA: I found the culprit. It seems the Apple HFS driver isn't compatible with Windows 8.1. I booted a rescue disk and removed the AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys files from C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers and rebooted, and Windows 8 booted fine. \nI obviously lose the ability to have read-only access to my Apple filesystems, but this is not a big deal to me because since I work on a lot of Windows boxes anyway I use external ExFAT-formatted SSDs and flash drives to transport data around.\nFor others, if having some sort of HFS access was a deal-breaker, there are other solutions out there that can mount HFS partitions. Can't think of any, especially that are free, but in any case, at least Windows now boots on this machine and works as expected.\n", "Q: I Would Like To Host an HTML Website Without Using Server.app I am somewhat a novice when it comes to the Apache web server. I currently host Ruby on Rails applications on my Mac Mini Server (Mavericks) using Phusion Passenger.  I know that some of the config files are in different libraries than the standard Apache implementation.  I'm currently using Server.app to host one HTML website.

Why did this happen and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Sounds as though you may have an interrupted iCloud login, and that you may have accidentally dismissed the warning that normally appears. Assuming latest system, use the Settings>iCloud to reestablish it. Clicking on the account name should cause the phone to prompt you for your iCloud password. After entering it correctly, the songs should appear playable again. You may also have to do that in Settings>iTunes and App Store.

Neither will show the other device.\nCan they be paired? If so, how do I accomplish that?\n\nA: No, it's not possible. While Bluetooth technology is capable of sending files between smartphones, computers and other devices, Apple has limited the function of Bluetooth on its iOS devices. You cannot send files, contacts or playlists between iPhones or computers with the default software. Third-party apps may let you transfer files with Bluetooth; however, these generally work between iPhones and iOS devices only rather than phones and computers.\n", "Q: \"Ghost text\" in terminal, Yosemite + TotalTerminal (formerly Visor) There's \"ghostet text\" in my terminal (see screenshot), and I'm hoping someone knows how to fix this…\n\nTurning background transpareny off fixes the problem, but it's not a solution which I'm a fan of.\nI tried cranking the opacity up to 100 % (thus turning transparency off), ran some commands, and turned the opacity back to 75 %, which made the ghosting appear yet again.\nI love working in the terminal, and really hope someone have a suggestion for a fix :)\nSpecs which might be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite 10.10.2\n\n*Macbook Pro 8.1 (early 2011)\n\n*Integrated graphics\n\n*Using TotalTerminal 1.5.4\n\n\nA: This one helped me:\n\nOpen your Terminal preferences, go to Profiles > Window > Background (Color & Effects), and set a light blur.\nI use 30% to keep anything in the background from disturbing the readability of thin fonts on an already translucent window, so I never noticed the \"burn-in\" effect when moving to Yosemite.\n\nSource: http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/text-burn-in-when-using-transparent-backgrounds-since-yosemite/2849\nHowever I set blur to 1% and \"ghost\" text disappeared.\n\nA: More recently in the thread linked to above, the developer of TotalTerminal replied:\n\ndarwin - Sep '15\nTotalTerminal is not going to work on El Capitan without System Integrity \n  Protection disabled.

I've tried everything I can think of, and never been able to find an easy way to send this keycode via Citrix.  I'm sure there are other uses for this, and I've read quite a few people's questions on the subject, but no one seems to have offered a viable solution.\nI have the Apple USB keyboard (full-size, with numeric keypad), and in the position where the INSERT key would normally exist, Apple placed the \"fn\" key. Now, I still need this key from time to time, but what I'd love to see is perhaps Control-fn or similar to send the keycode for INSERT.

I even tried a PRAM reset. Is there anything else I can try?\nUPDATE: holding cmd+r on restart allowed me to properly enter disk utility. \n\nA: Wondering what you meant by PRAM reset due to the fact that technically, on the Intel models, it's now called NVRAM even though you still have to use the P and R keys. If you have ethernet, you can hold down command-option-r at startup to boot to directly from Apple and run First Aid in Disk Utility. If you have a battery that can't be readily removed, you might want to reset system management (SMC) by ensuring that the Mac is turned off, then disconnecting everything except power, then pressing and releasing together shift-control-option and power on/off (eject) buttons. Then do your NVRAM reset again. That can help about half the time.

I have Macbook Pro ( late 2011) which I recently upgraded to Yosemite and works fine. It has only one hard drive which is 256GB SSD (Samsung). After purchasing I received Mountain Lion as an app in Apple Store and it is downloaded and Apple is not going to ship physical CD.\nI want to install Mountain Lion as virtual OS within Yosemite using VirtualBox because VirtualBox is free. Is it possible to do that without making my system unstable (a risk I cannot take) ? Does any one had issues with this type of setup or anything I should be aware of? Is there another more stable but free alternative to VirtualBox (other than Apple Bootcamp but I do not like having to shut down my primary OS and rebooting to Mountain Lion) ?\n\nA: It shouldn't make your system unstable since it runs in its own \"box\" per se..

So, recently I got a Mac system and I was planning to put in an Intel WiFi card (as an upgrade for its current card). Now, as we know, Apple and Intel do not get along WiFi-wise.\nHowever, this same card works in Linux.\nWhat would happen if I were to force the Intel drivers for the Linux kernel into Mac OS X? Would it work? Would there be severe instability or data loss? Is it even possible?\n\nA: As already posted: it is not possible. \nFirst of all, there is no such thing as 'force install'. There is nothing to install, and even if there was something to install there is no 'forcing' it.\nInstallation can have different meanings but these two are the ones relevant to your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installation meaning installing a Mac OS X package using OS X's installer. This is a package containing the files to be installed and instructions for the installer system so it knows where to put what, and how to do it.\n\n*Installation meaning getting a driver for a piece of hardware loaded in to the kernel. OS X works by using so called kernel extensions (.kext files, or officially, 'packages' because that is what they are) to add functionality to the kernel. A driver is such an addition, and the functionality being the ability to drive a piece of hardware. \nBoth cases are very operating system bound. This means that you cannot 'install' something without matching points 1 and 2. While you could technically skip point 1 by manually using the 'kextload' program to load a file as a kernel extension you would not be able to match point 2: only kernel extensions can be loaded in to the kernel. Kernel extensions have to match the ABI and API of the kernel. Those two acronyms (feel free the look them up, their full name and meaning are not relevant to the answer) are comparable to matching electrical outlets to electrical plugs. They are interfaces.\nIf you were to try to mix and match binary files (because that is what kernel extensions, modules and drivers are) it would not work because they are not compatible with the kernel and in some cases the processor that needs to execute the code. This compatibility with the kernel is where we arrive at the ABI and API part: those interfaces are like gas, water and electrical connections. Let's say Windows is gas, Linux is electricity and OS X is water. If you were to try and plug in a Linux electrical plug in to OS X's water faucet, you will not get anything to work. Water doesn't flow trough an electrical plug, and an electrical plug doesn't get any electricity from water.\nIf you were to try to load a linux driver (which is called a kernel module) in to the OS X kernel, by using kextload from a command line on OS X, it would simply tell you that it doesn't know what to do with the file you supplied. There is no forcing there, it simply cannot do anything with that file, just like you cannot force a light bulb to work from your water tap at home.\nAs for your problem: what are you trying to achieve? If you have a problem with your wireless connection, the problem is usually with the network or the environment. If you are missing certain features such as different frequencies or newer wireless protocols, you could try to simply install a better supported card. There are lists on the internet of natively supported wireless cards that will work just fine. Intel is not one of them.\nI hope this helps you and makes things as clear as possible.\n\nA: No, it's not possible, any more than you can run any other Linux binaries in OS X (without using a virtual machine).\n\nA: \nWhat would happen if I were to force the Intel drivers for the Linux\n  kernel into Mac OS X? Would it work? Would there be severe instability\n  or data loss? Is it even possible?\n\nAt best? 100% nothing. At worst? Crash your whole system and make it unusable or even unbootable.\nWhile Mac OS X and Linux are both different “flavors” of Unix, you can’t just grab parts from one OS and just install it into the other OS and expect them to work.\nThat said, if there is source code for the driver somewhere, you could potentially compile them for Mac OS X using the Xcode suite of development tools.\nBut that is one big if. The reality is compiling Linux application source code on a Mac OS X system from a Linux system is a crapshoot. Sometimes it works and you get to use nice Linux tools on a Mac OS X system. But sometimes it just won’t work. And that is at the application level. On the driver level it’s even less plausible or doable; and even if it was doable it would be difficult to do that at best.\nThat said, there seems to have been an open source effort to compile Linux Intel drivers for Mac OS X as seen here. But note that the versions of Mac OS X referred to are Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5; nothing more modern.\n\nA: Nothing would happen, because they would not work (kernel modules). MacOS and Linux have 2 completly different kernels. It's like trying to put engine from one car brand to another: it will not work because all the connections/specifications are totally different.\nBesides, there is no lsmod/insmod/modbrobe/rmmod commands in Mac OS X...\nNow, if you try binary drivers that would be like -- pardon my 'car' comparisons -- getting some materials for a car seat (according to specs for brand A) and trying to build (compile) the car seat for brand B. If the two car brands are compatible in area of car seats, than you would probably make it and it might actually work. But if you try to build race car seat from materials for 20 year old car, you're gonna have a rough ride, if not crash and injure yourself.\n\nA: As a side note, if you have some USB devices that only supply Linux driver but no OS X driver, you may consider using the device by running Linux in a virtual machine (VirtualBox?) then forward the USB connection from your Mac to the Linux VM.\nThen if you need to use some GUI tools, you may also setup X forwarding to your OS X desktop using XQuartz.\n", "Q: Receive iMessage on my lowtech phone I use iMessage on my mac so now many of my friend and coworker uses it like if it was SMS.\nI would like to know if there is a way to redirect my iMessage on my generic mobile device (not apple nor android)?\n\nA: You might wanna try iMessage on Android which provide a nice soft\n", "Q: Photo Booth freezes for >30s whenever I open it I've had this problem ever since I upgraded from Mavericks. Whenever I open Photo Booth, the application seems to be stuck on startup and I have to wait for like 50 seconds for it to become useable. A few months ago, it used to be like 20 seconds but it seems like the waiting time gets higher all the time.\nIm using a Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch Early 2013.\n\nA: Do you have Dropbox? I found that if I quit the Dropbox app, most of these 'hangs' go away. Starting Chrome and Safari, Launching Mail.app all improved when I quit Dropbox. I still have Dropbox, and I restart it to get it to sync every so often, but I leave it off.\nI have seen others with similar experience, but I don't use photobooth, so can not tell you if Dropbox is the cause. \nAlso, I found a noticeable improvement across the board from starting with a clean install of Yosemite. My 13\" 2011 MacBook Pro was nearly unusable following an upgrade to Yosemite.\n", "Q: How do I prevent my Mac from switching Wifi connections when at home? I have a MacBook Pro, running Mac 10.9.5.  I connect wirelessly to the Internet through my home Cisco LinkSys E900 router, which sits just 10 feet away from my computer.  However, frequently when I leave my computer inactive for a period of time and then return after waking it from hibernation, my Internet is connect to an xfiniti Wifi hotspot, without my having done anything.  How do I configure my Mac so that it will ignore the xfiniti Wifi hot spot and remain connected to my home network?\n\nA: Looks like the computer is set to prefer or prioritise the xfiniti Wifi hotspot over you home wifi, you can set your home Wifi to be of priority to any other Wifi connection and this is how to do that, \nSystem Preferences/Network/ then select Wifi and click on Advanced, you'll see all preferred networks there. \nClick and drag your home Wifi to the top. \n\n\nA: There is actually more to this story than most of the answers here get into. I tried moving my office network to the top of the list, and my mac still always chose xfinity whenever there was one around. \nAt one point when trying to connect to xfinity on purpose, during the connection process it told me that it had to \"upgrade xfinity connection\" or something like that. It claimed it was in the name of security. What it did when I agreed to it was to install a \"Profile.\" This created a new preference panel in System Preferences that was grouped along with Users & Groups and Startup Disk. \nIn this panel, there was only one option, Xfinity, and some text telling me yay how great it was. After removing this, my mac now honors the order of wifi networks in my Network Preferences.\n\nA: You can change the order of connection to your preferred networks.\nSystem Preferences -> Network -> WiFi\nThen drag the Cisco Linksys E900 to the top of that list (making sure xfiniti is below it -- or remove it entirely).\n\nA: Have home network first and xfinitywifi last. I'm guessing if the wifi signal is disrupted it will find xfinitywifi but won't go back when the home network signal returns.\n\nA: I have had similar problems for a long time, where xfinity keeps edging out my wifi, which is six feet away from my computer. I do not want to remove xfinity because the removal process notified me that it would remove it from all my devices. But I do want it for my iPhone.\nSo this is a quandary.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  In advanced preferences, I removed xfinity completely (twice).  The problem persisted. My answer is conjecture, but this would seem to be a job for Apple tech. support...as they can show you how to install and use adware medic.  I believe this is xfinity marketing in action.\n", "Q: where to type the password for printing over internet and can not install the driver on 10.10 My company has a network printer KONICA MINOLTA C353, I have added it on my Mac.\nI know there is still a password needed to fill in, but I can't find where to input it.\nWhat a bad luck is that I can install the latest driver on osx 10.10 (you can see the two disks are gray, you can install on it)\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I can't replicate this window on my end so I can't say for sure... But.. I would imagine it's under the \"Advanced\" button next to your printer's IP address.\nKonica Minolta printers call this feature \"Account tracking\", where you enter a password that is designated to you/your department so that they can track usage.  I would click the Advanced button and look for a password field or mention of Account Track.\nIf that doesn't work, and assuming you have the proper drivers loaded, I would try clicking the \"Printer...\" button in the bottom left of the dialogue.  This should open a standard OS X print dialogue (rather than the Adobe one in your screenshot) that should have an option in the dropdown menu for Security.  Under that option you should have an Account Track field.  Again, all of this is assuming you have the proper Konica driver installed.  The below example doesn't have the field I'm referring to but if it did, this is where it would appear.\n\n", "Q: What are the differences between Dreamweaver_14_LS20.dmg and Dreamweaver_13_LS20.dmg?

My MacBook (Retina, Mid 2012) currently has issues with its trackpad based on water damage earlier in the year - from time to time, the mouse pointer flicks around uncontrollably (although at other times, it's fine). I know I can probably get it fixed, that's another long story outside the scope of this question - assume it's unfixable for now.\nCurrently I have 10.9 (Mavericks) installed. I use an external USB mouse on a day-to-day basis, with the \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present\" option ticked, which prevents the flicking mouse pointer behaviour.\nI am considering upgrading to 10.10 (Yosemite), but I've been putting it off for sometime, because I'm concerned there may be a phase during the install where USB devices are disabled and/or my external mouse might be unavailable. As well as being unable to use the mouse, this might unintentionally mean that I \"click\" the mouse pointer and press something with a serious impact.\nAre my fears founded? Are there phases of the upgrade where I can't use a USB mouse?\n\nA: Your fears are unfounded, although kudos to you for being so conscientious about the unique circumstances of your machine before attempting to upgrade. In any case, consider an iMac or Mac Pro which must have an external mouse, there is no internal pointing device. You'll be fine as far as a USB pointing device goes as long as the mouse you're using did not require any special drivers when you first began using it.\n", "Q: how do I create a signature on yosemite? preview does not offer that option how do I create a signature on yosemite?  preview does not offer that option as shown in the youtube of how to create a signature.\n\nA: Go to the Tools menu > Annotate > Signature > Manage Signatures and use the \"Create Signature\" button at the bottom.\n", "Q: can you change iMessage settings by contacts on iPad Air?

The basic flow for making a PDF is:\nmarkdown foo.markdown | htmldoc --no-toc --no-title -f foo.pdf -\n\nAs for your filename-per-page, you coul incorporate echo to add it as an HTML element:\necho $(markdown foo.markdown) \"<p>foo</p>\" | htmldoc --no-toc --no-title -f foo.pdf -\n\nAnd for printing, the lpr(1) command will send a file to your default printer.\nTying this altogether:\nfor filename in `ls *.markdown`;\ndo\n    echo $(markdown \"$filename\") \"<p>$filename</p>\" | \n        htmldoc --no-toc --no-title -f \"${filename}.pdf\" -\n    lpr \"${filename}.pdf\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Here's a solution that uses LaTeX to generate the PDF. If you have long-form text in the Markdown files and would like to optimize for typographic readability (and I suspect you do), LaTeX tends to do a much better job compared to HTML engines.\nIt uses pandoc as an intermediary between Markdown and LaTeX, and also produces the PDF for you.\nMain script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmd-dir=\"MARKDOWN_DIRECTORY_HERE\"\npdf-dir=\"PDF_DIRECTORY_HERE\"\n\ncd \"${md-dir}\"\nfor filename in *.md; do\n    target-pdf=\"${pdf-dir}/${filename}.pdf\"\n    pandoc \"${filename}\" -t latex --latex-engine=xelatex -V geometry=a4paper -V fontsize=11pt -V listings -V header-includes=\"\\usepackage{fancyhdr}\\pagestyle{fancyplain}\\cfoot{}\\rhead{\\thepage}\\lhead{\\texttt{\\lstinline/${filename}/}}\" -V header-includes=\"\\linespread{2.0}\" -o \"${target-pdf}\"\n    echo \"produced ${filename}.pdf\"\n    lpr \"${target-pdf}\"\ndone\n\nRequired setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Get pandoc from Homebrew: brew install pandoc\n\n*Install the minimal version of LaTeX called BasicTeX\nTesting if you got the setup correct\nYou should be able to run in a new Terminal window (with bash)\necho \"test\" | pandoc -t latex --latex-engine=xelatex -o test.pdf\n\nand get a valid test.pdf document with just the word \"test\"\nCustomizations\nThere's a lot you can tweak with the LaTeX settings from the command line\n\n\n*\n\n*tweak the line spacing by changing the \\linespread{2.0} multiplier\n\n*adjust markings by replacing geometry=a4paper with geometry=a4paper,left=XXmm,right=XXmm,top=XXmm,bottom=XXmm\n\n*change font size by chaining 11pt to either 10pt or 12pt, and everything should scale accordingly\n\n*change the main font by adding another argument to pandoc: -V mainfont=\"NAME OF FONT\". You can also set monofont this way.\n\n\nA: I have not used WKPDF, but its author suggests a method by which it can be made to work in Yosemite:  https://github.com/plessl/wkpdf/wiki/How-to-install-on-MacOS-10.10-Yosemite\n\nA: You could use PhantomJS. It's not as straight forward as WKPDF for PDF generation since it has a wider range of features, but works fine.\n", "Q: Generating Safari developer certificate from Windows? The old instructions that have since been removed NOTE: not sure if this is best forum among the StackExchange group of forums/sites for this question. Please recommend a better one if this is not the best one.\nI worked with generating Safari developer certificate from Windows before, when it was actually supported (and as such building a Safari extension on Windows as well with Safari 5). Too bad that I didn't foresee Apple dropping Windows support with Safari 6 and along with that the instructions for generating Safari developer certificate from Windows. I never did save those instructions. Wish I did.\nIf I'm not mistaken (since I don't have the actual instructions), I believe from Windows, if one had the instructions, it likely should still be possible to generate the certificate request file to then submit on Apple's Safari developer portal to then generate/get the final developer certificate. So that one could build extensions on Windows Safari 5, if the extension need not be Safari version targeted/specific.\nSo if I'm not mistaken, I was just wondering if anyone had (archived) the old Windows instructions for generating the certificate request. Sure would be nice to see/read them, even if it doesn't work anymore, as a point of reference at least.\n\nA: This how-to might contain all necessary information provided by Apple in the past or help otherwise:\nThe Apple Safari extension development guide describes how to generate CSR(Certificate Signing Request) file for Mac. But, if we want to develop the Safari extensions on windows 7, we don’t have any resource to guide us. Here, I am providing steps to create  developer certificate for windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Register on Apple Safari developer program here\n\n*Download and install X Certificate and key management (XCA)\n\n*Generate a new private key in XCA. - After installing the XCA, go to File ->New Database. Give database name and password. Now, the new key option will be enabled.\n\n*Choose new key and give the name for private key and give size as 2048 Bytes.\n\n*From the XCA, choose “certificate signing requests” tab. Click on “New Request”  and fill the necessary details.\n\n*Export the Certificate Signing Request(CSR).\n\n*Request a certificate at apple here using the Certificate Signing Request(CSR).\n\n*Download the certificate from Apple account.\n\n*Click on “Certificates” tab on XCA and import the certificate which is downloaded from Apple into  XCA.\n\n*Export the certificate as p12 file.\n\n*Double click on *.p12 file. The certificate will import into the windows Certiciate-Manager.\n\n*Now, open the safari browser and click on Develop -> Show Extension builder. You are able to see that the certificate got detected.\n\n", "Q: Increase precision in numbers In Numbers, when I enter 0.981, it gets automatically formatted as 1.

I had manage to do this, with this classic command:\nsudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1\n\nBut the problem is, that when I close the lid when the screen is just locked, or it isn't locked it, wouldn't destroy the keys. It just locks the screen.\nShort version: I want to destroy FileVault2 keys when I close the laptop lid.\n\nA: In addition to the destroyfvkeyonstandby option, you also need to specify that pmset is setting hibernatemode 25 for the power management options. \nsudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25\n\nSetting both options ensures that the Mac in question will hibernate (where the contents of the RAM are written to disk) and also have the FileVault 2 key automatically removed from the saved RAM. \nWhen the laptop is awakened from hibernation, you should see your account icon and a password blank at the FileVault 2 login screen, which would indicate that it had been asleep.\n\nWhen this setting is set, you may run into some Power Nap-related issues.

But after 1 month when my brother bought iPhone 5s, I checked the sound output of the device through the same earpods that came with my iPod. The difference in sound output was huge, I am not talking about the sound quality but the loudness.\nI checked everywhere but there was no proper explanation why the difference in sound is so huge.\nIs it because the two DACs r completely different or is it something to do with Output Source Impedance? \n\nA: That is very weird; do you have a European version?  The output power on those is heavily limited. That is the only explanation. \nI have both the iPhone 5s and the iPod touch five and they have the exact same output voltages and voltage drop when headphones are connected. The output power is the same, I have heard from a few sources that the distortion levels on the 5s is better but they definitely have the same output level. Be sure to verify that the equalizer is disabled and sound check is off\n\nA: @tsultan1990. Acknowledging that I am not a techie, I offer the following. The different iDevices likely have different power output. Depending on how much juice is left in the battery, one of the iThingies may have gone into power save mode. \nAnother possibility Sultan is different ear/headphones have different impedance ratings. The higher the number, the more amplifier power will be needed to drive the phones to the same level of loudness. In fact Sultan, some audiophile quality headphones actually require a dedicated headphone amp. In that case, if you plug one set of phones into the iPod, listen, pull the phones out and plug the other pair in, you most certainly would hear a difference in loudness.\nStill another factor is the sensativity level. I am not sure how sensativity works but I suspect it is a measure of how much power is required to drive the device to produce a certain sound level.\nJust as a matter of information, the built-in DAC's on recent iProducts are not as good not considered to be of the same quality as the Wilson and Burr Brown. That would affect the quality of sound but would not the loudness.\nFinally Sultan, you might want to ditch the earphones that came with the unit and purchase a new pair of phones. SoundMagic 10s ($45), AKG Y50 ($100) Klipsch x11i ($350) all good starting points and offer various sound signatures. The AKG (an on ear, closed back headphone) has a nice urban look with slightly punchy bass that does not muddle the mids or highs and totally destroys Beats. \n", "Q: The first line on a TextEdit moves out of center alignment, and then when recentered it is not in alignment with the rest of the document I am new to word processing, so this is probably something incredibly simple that I am overlooking.  Knowing that, just compounds the frustration however of not being able to figure it out.  Any help that you can give me, so that I don't pull out all of my hair, would be greatly appreciated.\nHere is my problem.  I have created a document in TextEdit and centered all of the lines, and then saved the doc.  In this original document, the ruler above the page has two down arrows, one clear over to the left at the 0\" point, and a second one clear over to the right at the 20\" point.  Additionally, at the 0\" position is the \"T\" sign, which if I understand correctly, determines where the first line of text will begin.  Those three symbols are in these same exact positions, no matter which horizontal line of text I place my cursor on.  Besides those three symbols, the two down arrows and the \"T\", there are no additional special characters on the ruler, except for the inch numbers and the corresponding 1/8\" marks.\nSomething that I found interesting is that when I centered the document, the center point of all of the text is at the 7\" mark on the ruler, even though the ruler goes clear up to 20 inches.  So, I'm curious as to why this is?  However, the frustrating part is when I close the document and then at a later point reopen it and start to type on the first line again.  The entire first line automatically moves from being centered, to being aligned at the left of the page.  The remaining lines of text remain centered at the 7\" centering point discussed above, whether I type new text onto those lines or not.  The only line that is affected in this manner is the very first line.  Additionally, whereas on the original document there were only the three symbols above the ruler, the reopened document has numerous left indent arrows on the ruler as well as the original two down arrows and the \"T\" symbol.  If I then click the \"Center Text\" button on the document, while my cursor is still on this first line, it centers it on the 10\" point and leaves the remaining document centered on the 7\" point.  Even if I align the rest of the lines of text to the left, along with the first line, and then try to center them all, the first line centers at the 10\" mark, and the remaining lines of text once again center themselves at the 7\" mark.\nFor my purposes, it doesn't matter to me whether all of the lines are centered on the 7\" point of the page or the 10\" position.  I just need to have them all centered above one another.  Again, any help on this is very much appreciated.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Unless you really want a 20 inch wide paper printing you need to adjust your settings.\nIn TextEdit, click on File than on Page set up.\nIn the new window click on Paper Size and select proper size, like US letter or other standard formats.\n\nAs you know those markers above the scale are the TAB positions (for the tab key on your keyboard.\nYou can move them around as you see it fit, or remove them.

Is it dangerous to restart my computer again immediately after getting this notification? (I have to reboot in order to make my manual Continuity activation work.) And if so, how can I tell when the process is done?\n\nA: No, it is not dangerous. Pretty much every single task is queued and persisted if needed.

System tasks in OS X are designed to be fully automatic, autonomous and out of the way for the user.\nWhen it is complete you might get another message from the notification center, but it will probably just silently be done and your system will 'feel' much faster.\nMost of the post-install optimisations are things like Spotlight indexing and LSServices doing it's thing.\nIf you want to see if your system is doing something in the background, you can open up activity monitor and leave it idle for a bit so OS X detects that you aren't doing anything and then takes a little bite more CPU power and memory to do system tasks until you come in and start doing things again.

It doesn't have HDMI or VGA port. \nRight now I have one external monitor connected using thunderbolt to dvi adapter. I was wondering if its possible. I have another VGA monitor that I wish to connect. But I am not sure how to do so, there are some accessories available which are too expensive. \nI came across this product which is a thunderbolt to HDMI/DVI/VGA (3 in 1) adapter. \nI was wondering if it would be able to support two monitors at once.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/VicTec-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Adapter-ThinkPad/dp/B00K43Q8BS/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1422420455&sr=8-10&keywords=thunderbolt+to+dvi+vga+hdmi\n\nA: No, that 3-in-1 adapter will not drive multiple monitors.\nWhat you need is either a system that combines 2 monitors, or a system that chains them. While DisplayPort allows for daisy-chaining displays, this only works on supported hardware. This means your monitors need to both have two DisplayPort connectors and official support from the vendor and inside in the chipset to make this work. \nI believe that you aren't going to buy two expensive chain-able monitors since, well, you don't want to buy an expensive adapter ;-) The next stop would be stuff like Matrox's DualHead2Go. That is a device that allows 2 displays to be connected to a computer as one big display. http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/digital_se/\nIt does cost quite some money, so it might be in your category of 'expensive adapters'...\nThe problem with your question is that it is rather specific. It's a niche that most people don't even know about, and not a lot of sales or development is happening there. While it could probably be done cheaper, there simply aren't a lot of options here.\nJust remember: one video port can only ever drive 1 display, unless it's a daisy chained display port system or a device that turns 2 screens into 1 big virtual screen for the video port. There is no cheap 2-in-1 adapter to make this happen.\nSmall addition: you might be able to solve your problem with a USB DisplayLink adapter if you do not need 3D video or accelerated 2D video. It's a video card with a USB connector on one end and a video port on the other. It won't be fast or high-performance, but if you simply want more desktop space, it might work for you.

To be more specific, they both appear under USB in System Information, but only one in System Preferences and Audio MIDI Setup.\nIs it possible to use both at once?\n\nA: It used to be that two USB audio interfaces/mics would require you to create an aggregate device in order to use them both at the same time with OS X. As this was still the case in early 2014 (see the Macworld article, below), it probably is still the case today.\nHowever, there are differing reports when it comes to identical USB devices.\nBack in 2011, an audacity user was testing this specifically and reported:\n\nSo, far from being the outlier, Aggregate Device is required any\ntime you plug in two identical USB sound devices.\n\nBut in 2013, Blue Microphones themselves are reported to have said:\n\nBecause of the nature of USB devices, you won’t be able to use two of\nthe same USB microphones at once. Since they have similar digital\nthumb prints your computer won’t be able to distinguish the devices as\nseparate devices. With that being said, you can use two different USB\ndevices/microphones at once with no problem. As far as being able to\nuse it within a specific program you would have to find out if it\nallows multiple USB connections [...]\n\nSo, without further information, your best bet would be to try to create an aggregate device from both mics, and then test with an application which can record multiple channels (which I assume you already have since you want to do this in the first place).\nThis Macworld article gives details:\n\nPlug both USB microphones into your Mac, venture to the Utilities\nfolder (/Applications/Utilities) and launch Audio MIDI Setup. In the\nbottom left corner of the resulting window click the plus (+) button\nand choose Create Aggregate Device from the menu that appears.\nTo the right you'll see a list of all the audio devices attached to\nyour Mac, including those two mics. Tick the Use checkboxes for the\ntwo microphones (if any of them have multiple entries, look for the\none that has a 1 in the In column). As you do so, subdevices entries\nwill appear above the list of audio devices. This tells you which mic\nis using input channel 1 and which is using input channel 2. If you\nlike, click on the name Aggregate Device in the column to the left and\nchange it to something more intuitive such as “Two Mic Setup.”\n\nIf you are able to do that, then the resulting device should be both mics, one on each channel, so they can be recorded separately (or, potentially, recorded as stereo and separated later).\nOf course, if only one of the mics appears in Audio MIDI Setup then it's possible you won't be offered the option of selecting them both when creating an aggregate device.\nUpdate:\nSadly, this post suggests it will not be possible but, if you contact Blue, they should be able to 'reprogram' one of your mics so you can get this working as an aggregate device:\n\nBue Yetis have identical digitial footprints and therefore no matter\nhow many you plug in, they will be recognized as a single device.   I\ncontacted Blue and ultimately I was able to send one of my Yetis to\nthem for reprogramming and now my Mac will recognize it along with\nanother Yeti in order to create an aggregate device.\nFair warning, this process took over 2 weeks and I had to pay out of pocket\nshipping, they paid FedEx ground (signature required) back to me.\n\n\nA: FWIW, I had this exact problem trying to record with two identical Samson Q1U mics using Garageband. I created an aggregate device and it looked okay in the app. But then only one mic was actually recorded. Very frustrating.\nThe good news is that it works perfectly without any aggregate device mumbo jumbo in Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack. The Samson shows up twice in the input menu. The first is one mic and the second is the other. Phew!\n\nA: I am currently using two identical Blue Yetis on my MacBook Pro under the aggregate device I set up a couple months ago. (see photo) \nI think the trick might be creating the aggregate first but I have to say: I was panicking because I had a sit-down interview scheduled the next day and I was flailing about in my attempt at getting this set up so... of course, I can't remember my exact steps. \nPerhaps a stronger user might be able to make sense of this? \nFTR: I'm using a MacBook Pro OS 10.10.2, the latest version of Soundflower & LineIn and recording in Garageband.\n \nOnce both mics are recognized it's still tricky to get all of the settings just right, here are mine:\nSoundflower just “On”\nLineIn: Input – Aggregate Device; Soundflower 64ch\nSystem Pref: Output – Soundflower 64ch; Input Aggregate Device\nGarageband Prefs: Output – Built-in Output; Input – Aggregate Device\nPhysical Mics: Left Yeti is Channel 1 (aggregate device); Right Yeti is Chan 2 (aggregate device)\nRecord is enabled; red dots on each track are flashing \nI know it doesn't answer all the questions but it does work! \nMaybe just do what I did: watch 15 outdated YouTube videos, panic, scramble, stay up too late, have some adult beverages\n\nA: We thought we had connected two Yetis with an Aggregate Device using the setup Salamander reports, but discovered that the first mic in the list was actually picking up and broadcasting to both tracks. \nThus, even though we had what Salamander describes -- Physical Mics: Left Yeti is Channel 1 (aggregate device); Right Yeti is Chan 2 (aggregate device) Record is enabled; red dots on each track are flashing -- when we muted the first of the two Yetis, both tracks stopped recording. \n\nA: Update: As of Feb 21, 2019, you can now download the firmware update directly to your device through their free software called Sherpa. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the software. \n\n*Click Firmware Update on the image of the Yeti. \n\n*After it's updated, unplug the mic for a few seconds, and plug it back in. Give it a minute or two to finish initializing the mic with the new serial, and you should be good to go! \n\n\nEdit: Don't forget to set your number of channels to 4! https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=90202\n", "Q: which os x will be good for pentium 4 pc? I have an old pentium 4(2.67GHz) pc with 1760MB RAM, 80GB Hard-disk.\nI was wondering if i can install something different than windows xp on that.\n\nA: Apple's OS X is only able to run on Apple hardware. In small part because of driver limitations in the software due to Apple's limited hardware ecosystem that they need to support but largely it's due to the fact that Apple's licensing for OS X forbids running the OS on non-Apple hardware.\nThis topic has been well-covered on the site. For similar questions and answers please see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to evaluate OS X without purchasing Macintosh hardware?\n\n*Can I install Mac OS X Lion (10.7) on my Windows XP PC?\n\n*Is installing Mavericks on Hackintosh legal?\nQuestion regarding how to install OS X on non-Apple hardware are off topic here as they violate the EULA.\nIn all seriousness, I suggest you look to a Linux variant like Ubuntu or Mint or Fedora if you'd like to experiment with an alternative to Windows on your machine.\n\nA: None, as @IanC points out. Try running a Linux OS like CentOS or Ubuntu... \nBut if you feeling adventurous and start down the OSX86 (aka Hackintosh) route, be warned that you'll spend time tuning, tweaking and otherwise managing your install. If you're the type that enjoys that work then you're in for a ride. But if you just want your computer to work for you, stick with Windows or a Linux variant.\n\nA: It's quite possible to run Mac OS X Mountain Lion without much of a lag, if you install an aftermarket dedicated GPU. This is because Mac OS X works way better with the Intel core processors because they have integrated GPU. So having an aftermarket dedicated graphics card will let you run Mac OS X. Also check if your motherboard is supported or not. Let me also remind you again that what you are about to do is illegal.\n", "Q: How do I sync my iPhone to my new Windows computer? (My iPhone syncs fine with a bunch of other computers.)\niTunes won't run after installation.\nI Download 64 bit iTunes from https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/\nThe installation on Windows 7 Enterprise goes without a glitch.\nWhen I run it it says \"Apple Application Support was not found. Apple Application Support is required to run iTuners. Please uninstall iTunes, then install iTunes again. Error 2 (Windows error 2)\" (I get this message twice, with one minor variation. The advice does not help.)\nI found articles on the net (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2151777?start=0&tstart=0) which says to use WinRAR to unpack the installer and then install the components one by one.\nDownload and install WinRAR.\nRight-click the iTunesSetup.exe icon and choose \"Open with WinRAR\".\nOnce the EXE is opened in WinRAR, double-click AppleApplicationSupport.msi and when the installer window is open choose \"Repair\".\n\niTunes now starts fine.\nI connect my iPhone 4S. Nothing happens. It is not charging. iTunes does not discover it.\nThere is a message about \"USB Hub Power exceeded.\" This happens regardless if I connect it directly or through any of my three (3) different externally powered USB hubs.\nI had this before for USB Memory sticks as well, but re-installing drivers helped.\nWhat do I do now?\n\nA: I removed Citrix which was installed on my computer. See this link here: http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f10/solved-usb-hub-power-exceeded-767570.html\nIt now works.\n", "Q: Can't see other Mac workstation via ethernet but OK over Wi-Fi So, I upgraded router to latest DD-WRT firmware.\nNow, for some reason, can't see my Mac Desktop from my MacBook if connected to Ethernet.

I downgraded to a previous DD-WRT and the issue is gone. It was a matter of lan switching not working.\nDowngrading back to DD-WRT firmware SVN revision 23919 fixed it.\n", "Q: How to repair ~/Library permissions? While migrating to Yosemite, I manually copied some ~/Library files and folders from my old system to my new system. Now some of the affected apps show weird behavior. Often they cannot save their preferences. One example is the iTunes error message when I try to backup my iPhone:\n\nWhenever I check, my user has read & write permissions. Disk Utility Repair permissions unfortunately does not help here.\nWhat are the correct permissions for files and folders in ~/Library and ~/Library/Preferences? And how do I set them?\n\nA: It's possible that the Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs option in the resetpassword tool will correct those permissions for you, though I'm unsure how 'deep' into your home directory it will reset.\nThis blog post gives the steps for Lion, which appear to be the same in Yosemite (Note: that last link details instructions for resetting a password, which is obviously not what you are doing here, which is why I linked to the Lion instructions. However, the same tool is used in each process):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Restart, and before you hear the chime, hold down the Command and R keys.\n  \n*You’ll be at the Repair Utilities screen. Click the Utilities item in the Menu Bar, then click Terminal.\n  \n*In the Terminal window, type resetpassword and hit Return.\n  \n*The password reset utility window launches, but you’re not going to reset the password. Instead, click on icon for your Mac’s hard drive\n  at the top. From the dropdown below it, select the user account where\n  you’re having issues.\n  \n*At the bottom of the window, you’ll see an area labeled Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs. Click the Reset button there.\nThe reset process takes just a couple of minutes. When it’s done, exit\n  the programs you’ve opened and restart your Mac.\n\n\nA: Try this first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app from the /Applications/Utilities/ folder\n\n*Paste this:\ndiskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`##\n\n\n*Enter admin password.\nSee if that helps. \nIf it does not, what I would recommend is to backup the machine with time machine, create a new admin account. Delete the corrupt user preserving the home folder. Create a new \"you\" user with a slightly different name (like using your middle initial) and then add your main data back to this home folder - and very carefully cross migrate the contents of the Library folder without messing uy the ~/Library permissions. \n", "Q: Driver issues Windows 8.1 Pro on Late 2011 MBP I installed Windows 8.1 pro on my late 2011 mbp and now I'm having issues with audio and display drivers.

Just like your computer you shut it down or at least restart it on a regular basis. People don't do this with iPhones, because well, it's a phone and they may 'miss a call' or it's just habit for most. It causes a lot of memory leaks especially if developers aren't skilled enough to know how to test within their apps for memory leaks. In other words, a soft restart (turning it off in the normal manner by holding the sleep button and sliding to power off and then turning it back on) will 99% of the time autonomously repair itself and reset the memory. The 1% chance it does not you can do a hard restart (holding the sleep and home button simultaneously for 4-5 sec) will fix your issue. \n\nA: Idk if it’d help but there is app for PC named 3utools (you can google it) and there is ability for deleting corrupted icon from homescreen.

With every Apple update this number increases. My laptop freezes for 1-3 min a couple of times per week because some process I've never heard of starts consuming 100% of CPU time till they likely crash. From googling process names the Apple process launch policy on laptops with limited battery life seems to be: launch every time everything for anything anyone might ever want to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to do something about this?\nWhat I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some of the processes are started by root (I don't want to do much about those). \n\n*However, most of them are started by my user, and most of those are for things that I do not need or that I have explicitly disabled in system preferences (keychain, messenger...). \nI guess launchd is in charge of starting all these processes. I've found /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons but these are just a small fraction of the processes that get launched, and none of them are system processes.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they are all launched by launchd is there a configuration file for startup processes somewhere?\n\n\nNote: I don't mind at all that a process gets launched when I do something that requires it. It is just that I find 200 processes, most of them for things I don't always need and a lot of them for things I've explicitly disabled, to be just nuts.\nUpdate:\nIt seems that sudo launchctl list is a good place to start, one can then use launchctl load <service> and launchctl remove <service> to load/remove services. It would be nice to get a list of which services are safe to remove, and which services should never ever need to be removed, gonna experiment with that.\n\nA: ~200 processes seems a tad high, but not out of range for *nix systems depending on the hardware and services being invoked. Managing the things that you've installed through the LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons is the best plan that won't kill your system. Digging into services invoked by launchd is not something I'd recommend unless you understand what the process is there for and what it does - some launchd processes are inter-related and killing one can cause another to fail, and you're heading to a broken system.\nFor the \"freezing\" problem, find the service(s) that are suddenly spiking their CPU usage and do some Google searching, note what apps you have open at that time, read the Console logs and see if you can narrow down the cause.

By default anyone the list was shared with can update the list but the list admin (the person who created the list) can prevent the other group members from editing. Any changes made to the list are synched to all group members.

I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 (MacBook Pro 9,2). Few years ago I was using previous versions of Mac OS X, and it was a great experience. I've found it delicious OS for personal use.\nToday I use Yosemite and performance really slows down. Safari takes about 15 seconds to open, and 5 seconds to be ready for use. Terminal takes about 7 seconds to open.\nI don't see the reason to buy new hardware, because i don't see any advantages in Yosemite. It has more simple design, but it works much more slowly. Okay, in theory I can receive cell calls on my MacBook Pro. But it takes about 10 seconds to show incoming call and to make it possible to click \"answer\".\nI've removed all applications from automatic boot. I've cleared my HDD. I've tried almost everything and there were no results! It still works very slow!\nToday I've tried Yosemite on the same hardware (Core i5, etc.) and it works really fast. Two differences are: it was Mac Mini and it was late 2014 model. I don't believe that Safari or something else requires new hardware to work normally. It seems like Apple just force me to buy new hardware. I guess in a year my MacBook will work like a turtle!?\nSo what can I do to improve my MacBook performance?\n\nA: While trialling Yosemite here at school I found the overall experience can vary wildly depending on how the installation is performed.\nMost people will perform an upgrade installation by downloading the Yosemite installer and simply letting it run. The end result here is very variable and largely depends on the state of the system being upgraded. One or two of our teaching staff here have upgraded this way (against our advice) and have experienced various performance issues.\nThe other (better) way is to first back the system up using Time Machine and then make a USB Yosemite installer. Boot from the USB installer, run Disk Utility to erase the existing partitions and then perform a proper clean installation. You'll end up with a completely fresh installation which should run nicely, and you'll then have the option of restoring whatever you need from the Time Machine backup. Here at school we use DeployStudio for imaging and deploying to our Macs, and teachers using our \"clean\" build of Yosemite have fewer issues than those performing and upgrade of the existing OS.\n\nA: I guess you have already check through \"Activity Monitor\" and made sure that there isn't anything that severely uses your resources.\nAfter that, you can run some benchmarks and compare the MBP and the Mini (you said they had the same hw?)\nSpecifically you should check CPU, RAM and Hard Drive performance.\nIf other mid-2012 MBP are running fine with Yosemite, then it could be the hard drive dying.\nAlso, backup just in case.\n\nA: Although everyone here made great and thoughtful suggestions, it's very difficult to know what's causing the slowdown from afar. One thing you could do is download the latest EtreCheck and run it to see if there are other potential reasons for the slowdown. A fair number of 3rd-party apps out there leave detritus on your system that can slow your Mac to a crawl. Worth checking out, and the best part is, it's free. Also, note that an update (10.10.2) just posted and it resolved virtually all lag on my ancient 2009 Unibody. Hopefully it will help you, as well.

Then run brew install bash, it will install bash 4.3.33. It's the easiest and safest way.\nThen add the path to the executable to /etc/shells. For example: \n/usr/local/bin/bash \n\n", "Q: Background time tracking application I've a bad memory, therefore I can't recall where I spent my time during last day, last week and definitely not last month.\nHowever I still need to log my hours and generate reports to track the projects evolutions and time spent in each feature.\nOk, nothing new so far. Problem is I used ManicTime and I loved, it silently collected all my info day after day and when I had to check where I spent my hours in certain day, I simply check by hour by day and it was perfect.\nBut on mac... I found a huge list of application that or doesn't do a proper tracking (harvest, timings, tyme) or doesn't give me reports I want like RescueTime.\nIs there any application that silently does the job? As I work with multiple virtual machines, cross platform support is a big plus.\n\nA: Timing for Mac tracks down your activity in the background without using timers: https://timingapp.com\n", "Q: Set launchd log level How can I set the log level of launchd in MacOS Yosemite? \nI've tried launchctl log level debug but it doesn't work.\n\nA: Since Apple publishes the source code for launchd, you might have better luck just attaching a debugger to the process to inspect or set breakpoints.\nThat and changing the log level might also be overkill. You can inspect the loaded jobs quite easily and disable them / change them to call debugging scripts or even set another job to dump status or log messages when another process starts or stops.\nI'd be interested in more specifics of what you are doing - this seems like a great example of an XY problem. You're asking about the solution you see as the best way forward and not about what the actual problem / issue is.\n", "Q: Can I copy a file to iCloud drive from the command line? I'd like to write a script to backup some files to my iCloud drive. The drive shows up in the Finder, but I don't see it from the command line.  Is there a way to do something like:\n\ncp mystuff.tgz /iCloudDrive/backups/\n\n\nA: iCloud Drive directory is located here:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\n\nThere are some other directories listed inside Mobile Documents, their names depend on the app which owns them. For example: com~apple~Pages/. \n", "Q: Shell script to restart a certain process if it is not responding I need an java application to run 24/7 on my mac. Unfortunately the JVM process sometimes gets stuck and thus the java application does not respond anymore.\nIs there a possebility to detect if a given process has crashed (or at least is not in a proper running state) and restart this specific process subsequent?\nI found \nps aux|grep java\n\nwhich lists the java process (/usr/bin/java)\nNow I need to know how to watch the process state codes and how to restart this particular process in e.g. a shell script.\nBTW, the process state is T which means stopped as far as I know.\nEDIT:\nUnfortunately four suggestions didn't work on my machine. I configured an global agent and the jar is starting properly but the process still fails after a certain period of time. Strangely enough the process in activity monitor is not marked as not responding, whereas the context menu of the dock item does (see figure) \n\nA: Look at the launchctl which is an interface to launchd daemon.\nThis daemon main task is to take care of all the system and users\ndaemons. This care includes the possibility to restart a daemon whenever\nit quits or crashes.\nTo start with, I advise you to read:\nman launchd\nman launchctl\n\nThen have a look at one of the simplest plist files used by the\nsystem to help you writing your own one to survey JVM and restart it if needed:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.autofsd.plist\n\n\nA: Use LaunchD, it's what Mac OS X uses itself for running and monitoring programs.\nYou will need to create a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon file, and you can specify that it should get killed and restarted if it reaches the T state.\n\nA: One way maybe using applescript as shown here. Another maybe by the scripting tool sikuli. \nSikuli watches your screen and can respond based on what it sees. So, if it finds Not Responding on the screen it can be scripted to act.\nHere is a thread discussing a similar problem to yours which also gives the script below as a solution to their problem. The sikuli website has all the documentation you need.

I want to use it for a thing.\nMost system folder icons and stuff are in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/* But these folder icons are not. Where are they located?\n\nA: I think you are looking for either of the following files:\n/System/Library/PreferencePanes/iCloudPref.prefPane/Contents/Resources/iCloud.icns\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder/Contents/Resources/iCloudNoDocs@2x.png\n\nWithout clarification I can only guess what you want but I think I figured out that you want the folder icons shown within iCloud Drive. It seems like those icons are just a generic folder icon with the relevant app icon superimposed on top of it.\n", "Q: Delete (not hide) calendar events automatically or via CLI There are many answers online on how to hide old events from iCloud calendars, but not many on how to actually delete them. From the settings, it appears to not be possible to do automatically. There may be, however, a command-line way to do it. I’m looking for something that doesn’t rely on AppleScript to call the Calendar app and doing it there, as I’ve gotten mixed results with such solutions, and would rather not invoke a GUI.\n\n\nA: Since iCloud is based on CalDAV, this shouldn’t be too hard. Deleting an event boils down to a simple HTTP request, e.g.:\nDELETE /calendars/johndoe/home/132456762153245.ics HTTP/1.1\nIf-Match: \"2134-314\"\n\nThis project on GitHub could serve as a good starting point: jcs/iclouddav\n", "Q: App to toggle 2G and 3G I just purchased iPhone 5s and as a surprise I see no 2G/3G toggle switch. Am from India and I stay in a place where I have poor 3G connectivity. D we have any app in the App Store that can facilitate this option?\n\nA: Nope and I quite sure that something like this cannot be changed by an app, even if there was a toggle in the Settings.\nMaybe there are solution provided the iPhone is jailbroken.\n\nFor the record, let me mention that the existence of such a toggle seems to depend on the carrier one use.\nReason for saying that is because I used to have the 3G toggle, but it disappeared after I applied a \"carrier update\" that showed up. Maybe in order to have the 4G toggle appearing? I don't know.\nTo avoid confusion, carrier updates have nothing to do with iOS updates\n", "Q: Apple Thunderbolt display not turning on when connected to ASUS Z87 motherboard I recently purchased custom build PC with Asus Z87 Expert Thunderbolt motherboard, Intel i7-4790K processor, Sapphire R9 270X 2 GB graphics card, etc.\nIt's not working with my Apple Thunderbolt display 27″. I have installed Intel Thunderbolt driver as well.\nWhen I connect this PC to the Apple Thunderbolt display, the display won't turn on. I am very disappointed now. Does anybody know how to make it work?\n\n\n\nA: Okay, I have figured it out myself :)\nFeeling extremely happy.\nSteps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Enter BIOS setting. For most of the computer, you just have to press\nF2 while computer starts.\n\n*Enter Advance BIOS setting mode.\n\n*Enable iGPU and Multi-Monitor option in the Graphics section.\n\n\nThat's it. Restart your computer and Enjoy the terrific Apple thunderbolt display quality in Windows operating system.\nMy PC specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Motherboard: ASUS Z87 Expert\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i7 4790k\n\n*Discrete GPU: Sapphire R9 270X 2GB Dedicated\n\n*and Apple Thunderbolt Display 27\" :)\n\n\nAny Windows operating System (7/8/8.1) will work but my my operating system is Windows 10 Technical Preview.\nHere is a screenshot\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue recently with a new Lenovo Thinkpad X1 carbon, that has two combined USB-3/Thunderbold-3 ports.\nWhen attaching the Apple Thunderbolt display using a Thunderbolt-3 to Thunderbolt-2 adapter (from Apple), the display would be recognized, but did NOT turn on.\nI could solve the issue by going into the BIOS and enable BIOS-support for Thunderbolt.\nAfter that it works perfectly (currently running Windows-10 with dual-monitor support.\nRegards, JvW\n", "Q: MacBook Pro does not go into sleep mode after upgrading to Yosemite I have a MacBook Pro 13″ and after I had upgraded to Yosemite the device does't go in sleep mode when I want it (anything is disconnected from the device). I went to energy power savings to change my settings but still doesn't work.\nThis is what terminal shows to me with pmset -g assertions command:\n2015-01-29 12:02:35 +0100 Assertion status system-wide: BackgroundTask 0 ApplePushServiceTask 0 UserIsActive 1 PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep 0 PreventSystemSleep 0 ExternalMedia 0 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep 0 NetworkClientActive 0 \nListed by owning process: pid 76(hidd): [0x0000de4e000908e3] 00:17:53 UserIsActive named: \"com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle\" Timeout will fire in 286 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease No kernel assertions.\n\nA: don't know why but everything went ok and fixed after just two days...thanks a lot anyway! \nMac\n", "Q: Exchange account in Mail has wrong username, but is not editable I recently set up a new iMac running Yosemite (10.10.1). After I signed into my iCloud account, my mail/calendar/contacts accounts were set up for me; so far so good.\nThe problem is that in Mail.app one of my accounts, which is Exchange-based, has the wrong User Name value -- it's got \"jens\" instead of \"jens@example.com\". This of course means Mail can't log into the account; if I enable it I just get endless enter-your-password dialog boxes.\nThe real problem is that I can't fix the first problem -- the User Name field in the account settings in Mail prefs is disabled! (So are many of the other fields like Email Address and Internal Server.) Maybe this is because the account is managed by the Internet Accounts system pref? But my other account, which uses IMAP, does have an editable User Name field...\nWhat's even stranger is that the Calendar and Contacts apps can log into the Exchange server just fine, and if I look in their prefs for the account settings, they've got the correct username. It's only Mail that's got it wrong.\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Exchange account -- this pops up a stern warning that the account will be removed from all my other devices that use iCloud Keychain. No way; I don't want to risk screwing up email access on the other Mac and iOS devices where it's working fine!\n\n*Configure a new Exchange account to connect to the same server -- this doesn't work. Apparently Mail's new-account assistant realizes that there's already an account with this server/username and reuses it instead of creating a new one.\n\n*Find where the username is stored in Mail's user defaults and edit it -- I haven't been able to find it. Looks like Mail's storage of user defaults or accounts has changed a lot since the olden days, both due to sandboxing and to iCloud.\n\n*Look online for other people with my problem -- haven't found anything on Apple's (useless) support community site or here.\n\n\nA: I've been looking for an answer to this as well. Here's how i resolved it.\nI found the file that stores the username in ~/Library/Accounts/Accounts3.sqlite. I used the sqlitebrowser app from http://sqlitebrowser.org/ to open it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop Accounts3.sqlite to the dock icon to open the file.\n\n*Click the Browse Data tab.\n\n*Change the Table to ZACCOUNT.\n\n*I used the ZACCOUNTDESCRIPTION field to determine the right row to make the change.\n\n*Update the value in the ZUSERNAME field.\n\n\nFor me, entering the full email address didn't work. I used domain\\user instead.\n\nA: Sounds frustrating. I had a similar problem recently where they moved my account to a new server. Unfortunately I did have to just remove the account and re add one, which turned out alright after I fixed my rules and copied my ssignatures\nI would suggest disconnecting from the cloud, removing the broken account, then reconnecting to the cloud to see if it pulls the working ones. If not you can always disconnect then remove and add again before reconnecting to the cloud.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) support in OS X Yosemite I've got a device that connects to a computer using Bluetooth's SPP (Serial Port Profile) which is widely supported by almost everything however is now considered legacy.\nI'm struggling to get my device to work in Yosemite and it doesn't seem to support it?\n\nA: I was able to pair a bluetooth serial port via the preferences panel:\nApple Menu > System Preferences... > Bluetooth\n\nMy adapter was discoverable, failed auto-pairing, but I was able to pair with the pin code provided in the online documentation.

Everything works but I can't click on the menubar anymore when the App is selected..! Any help?\nThis is what I did\npreviously:\n\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<false/>\n\nafter:\n\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<true/>\n\nthis is what I get: \"resource envelope is obsolete (custom omit rules)\" what does it mean?\n\nA: When you set \"LSUIElement\" to true, it makes the application in question a semi GUI-less application.  While calling up the application in this state, it still shows up windows, but it does neither show its Dock icon nor its menu bar.\nAs to alternatives: The only real alternative is to have the application support this on its own (e.g. inside its own GUI).\nKeep in mind that enabling \"LSUIElement\" (a.k.a. setting it to true) is not telling the application to hide its Dock icon, but rather tells the Dock not to show the application's icon while it is running.  Also GUI-wise there are two main processes running for the user: Finder and the Dock.  The first is merely an application on its own and will allow you to browse and alter the files on your computer and the latter besides showing and controlling the Dock icons controls the menu bar itself (not the menu items of each application, mind you) as well as the Dashboard and Launchpad among others. You can see its effect when running Terminal and type in \"killall Dock\".  It will effectively restart Dock and its depending items.\n", "Q: MBP crashing after wake from long sleep after Yosemite Install Since I updated to Yosemite my mid-2012 MBP crashes when I open the lid after a long sleep.  I have read numerous posts about other users experiencing the same issue, but all of their solutions have failed for me.  I am attaching the error report information in hopes that someone might be able to shine some light on the issue(s).  I have upgraded the HD to a samsung evo SSD and the memory, but never experienced any issues like this before Yosemite.

Thanks @mtoro!\n\nA: So here is my report:\nI have bought a 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Corsair RAM memory to replace for the former Crucial (16GB) I had. After installation, I ran the hardware test and no issues showed up. I've been working in my MBP for 2 days now with no problems at all. Basically, when I open the lid every morning it works just as it should be, fast and efficient, no kernel panics, no booting issues.\nMy kernel_task went from about 450MB to 950MB though (same issue with the former Crucial 16GB memory). However, it seems to be normal when upgrading RAM and it is not a big deal since I got other 15 GB for further tasks. In other extreme cases, some people had up to 4GB of kernel task (not my case). Here there is a link about that specific issue if you wanna have a look:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1395156\nTo sum this up, in my case changing the 16GB RAM from another producer made the difference.

I also usually sorts by the Size column so the big stuff is right at the top. \nAs a professional Mac consultant, this is the method I use to find people's data, I don't bother with any 3rd party utilities for this. \n\nA: You could try du -h in the Terminal app. This will show you info about how full is your filesystems.\nThen sudo du -h -s / will show you size of each directory in / so you can figure out which one is bigger than you would expect. But this might take a couple of minutes to run on the full disk.\n\nA: I see that you already used some space discovery utilities like Daisy Disk and Disk Inventory (X?).  Therefore I find it difficult to throw in another tool to try.\nGenerally there are two ways of finding out where your hard drive space went: manual and automatic.\n\"Automatic\" are tools like you used including Daisy Disk, Disk Inventory X and WhatSize among others.\n\"Manual\" would be that you go through your folders manually either in Finder right-clicking (or Ctrl-clicking) them and select \"Get Info\" or using Terminal (if you are not afraid of the command line) and see which folders are using up the largest space.  Once found, you go into the folder and do the same again.\nFor Terminal, you can use the following commands:\ncd /\ndu -chxd 1\ncd large_folder_here\nRepeat the last two commands until you found the items of interest.\ncd / will change into the root folder of Mac OS X (the best place to start looking really)\ndu -chxd 1 will list down folders with their respective size. The \"-chxd 1\" options I provided will provide a size total at the end (-c), list sizes in human readable format (-h), limit the search to your system drive (-x), so that external or network drives are not searched and finally will only list the contents of the current directory (-d 1), which makes the amount of data better to wield.  Totally optional, but recommended, after finding a directory to go into, change into it, then clear the output screen of Terminal (Cmd-K).  That way you do not accidentally go through folders you already looked through, saving you some time.\nTo remove a file or a folder, type in:\nrm -R folder_to_delete\n-or-\nrm file_to_delete\nIf you are not the owner of a file/folder, you will run into an error when deleting a file.  To overwrite this, you can prepend sudo to the remove command earlier.\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure that you know what file you are removing.  Removing system files inadvertently leaves you to re-install the OS again, which may be cumbersome and lengthy.\n", "Q: OSX 10.10 Python crashing from bash When I run Python through bash it keeps seg faulting on me. The crash happens for example if I just type >>> \"\\n \\n, but also for a lot of other cases. From my limited understanding of the stack trace, the problem is originating from readline.so. I've googled it but can't find anything mentioning this for Yosemite. It also doesn't appear to be an issue on any other Yosemite machines I've personally used.\nProcess:               Python [9000]\nPath:                  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python\nIdentifier:            Python\nVersion:               2.7.3 (2.7.3)\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        bash [8721]\nResponsible:           Terminal [8717]\nUser ID:               501\n\nDate/Time:             2015-01-29 06:27:11.243 +1000\nOS Version:            Mac OS X 10.10.2 (14C106a)\nReport Version:        11\nAnonymous UUID:        96E040C2-750F-A04F-D83A-A4DDB5C2D113\n\nSleep/Wake UUID:       97B6A1FE-FCBF-40EB-9C2F-D98BF0B09893\n\nTime Awake Since Boot: 420000 seconds\nTime Since Wake:       420000 seconds\n\nCrashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n\nException Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000\n\nVM Regions Near 0:\n--> \n    __TEXT                 0000000100000000-0000000100001000 [    4K] r-x/rwx SM=COW  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python\n\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n0   readline.so                     0x00000001002eff97 call_readline + 647\n1   org.python.python               0x0000000100008852 PyOS_Readline + 274\n2   org.python.python               0x000000010000a0a8 tok_nextc + 104\n3   org.python.python               0x000000010000a853 PyTokenizer_Get + 147\n4   org.python.python               0x000000010000544a parsetok + 218\n5   org.python.python               0x00000001000e7722 PyParser_ASTFromFile + 146\n6   org.python.python               0x00000001000e8983 PyRun_InteractiveOneFlags + 243\n7   org.python.python               0x00000001000e8c6e PyRun_InteractiveLoopFlags + 78\n8   org.python.python               0x00000001000e9451 PyRun_AnyFileExFlags + 161\n9   org.python.python               0x000000010010006d Py_Main + 3085\n10  org.python.python               0x0000000100000f14 0x100000000 + 3860\n\nThread 0 crashed with X86 Thread State (64-bit):\n  rax: 0x0000000000000000  rbx: 0x0000000100600000  rcx: 0x0000000100243620  rdx: 0x000000010023fa00\n  rdi: 0x0000000000000000  rsi: 0x00000001002f0254  rbp: 0x00007fff5fbff5e0  rsp: 0x00007fff5fbff510\n   r8: 0x0000000000000000   r9: 0x0000000000000001  r10: 0x0000000100600000  r11: 0x0000000000000001\n  r12: 0x0000000000000001  r13: 0x000000000000000b  r14: 0x00007fff5fbff5a0  r15: 0x00007fff5fbff520\n  rip: 0x00000001002eff97  rfl: 0x0000000000010206  cr2: 0x0000000000000000\n\nLogical CPU:     6\nError Code:      0x00000004\nTrap Number:     14\n\n\nBinary Images:\n       0x100000000 -

I would like to check the contents of a USB stick drive from a not-quite trusted source (my sister): is there a safe way to do this in OSX 10.9.5 or 10.10.1?\n\nA: What I typically do is mount the USB drive in an isolated virtual machine. But this requires you have a hypervisor installed and a guest operation system configured, etc. This works because I can snapshot the VM state as well as isolate at the network level. But it's too complicated to explain here.\nProbably the easiest way to do this is to mount the drive as read-only. You can do this by using diskutil from Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.\n\n*Insert the drive into a USB port.\n\n*Run diskutil list from Terminal and note the disk number for your USB drive. Here's what my output looked like\n\n\n\n$ diskutil list\n  /dev/disk0\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         250.1 GB   disk0s2\n    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n  /dev/disk1\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *249.8 GB   disk1\n                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                  5F6A08FD-AD5D-4C63-9DF2-8C1DE409F264\n                                  Unencrypted\n  /dev/disk2\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *32.7 GB    disk2\n    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n    2:                  Apple_HFS TomThumb                32.4 GB    disk2s2\n\nSo my USB drive is disk2.\n\n\n*Eject the disk by running diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX (which would be \"disk2\" for me)\n\n*Remount disk in read only mode by running diskutil mountDisk readOnly /dev/diskX\n\n*Use Finder or Terminal to examine the disk.\n\n\nNote that if you eject the drive, you'd need to run this sequence again to have it mount as read only. There are other apps that automate mounting disks as read only but the command line is the only real UI for any OS! ;-) #opinion\n\nA: That's a good idea and a lot of malware depends on being able to write to where it is running from but it is not foolproof and if the O/S can read the drive then stuff can get off the drive.\nFor the really paranoid I would be tempted to download and burn a LiveCD (Ubuntu or the like) that will boot your Mac. Boot it from the LiveCD and then examine the contents.\nYou can then remove any potentially harmful Macintosh executables, Javascript or Flash exploits or infected files of other kinds.\nThough it will require a bit of technical savvy to do all of that.\n\nA: One option is to reboot your Mac to a Linux installation CD/DVD.  \nYou can unmount your local hard disk once the Linux desktop loads.\nYou can then plug in the thumb drive and be isolated from your installation of Mac OS X as well as your local hard disk.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Late-2013 SD card reader not loading cards after 10.10.2 update In my Macbook Pro 15inch, late 2013, the SD card reader doesn't work after installing Yosemite 10.10.2. Doesn't load cards at all. Tried to blow out slot, fiddling with switches inside port, nothing.\nHow can I analyze and fix this issue\n\nA: The first step is to open system information and see if anything shows for that device.\nNext would be to install a clean OS on to a USB drive or back up and erase the Mac / reinstall the OS. You could try a safe boot, but I've not seen that make any difference for the SD card slot even though it could help if you had an oddball kernel extension conflict.\nAlso, be sure to test your SD cards on another computer or reader as it would be a shame to have that be the issue and have to restore a backup to find out that was the issue.\n", "Q: How do I sort/recover deleted items on Mac? So I'm a DJ and I was going through my music files in Itunes when I made a bonehead mistake of deleting about half of my music library! Now I go to my Trash Bin in hopes of being able to recover those files that I deleted, however I am unable to sort through the files by \"Date Added\" in the trash bin. When I select \"Date Added\" as a column, all of the dates show \"--\". If I have dates, I can look at everything I deleted when I made my mistake, and simply \"put back\" all those items. However, my trash bin is not showing me any dates in this field! Is there any way to bring dates into the \"Date Added\" column, or if there is any other way to sort through my trash bin to recover those files into iTunes?\nFYI: I currently use OS Mavericks\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are not afraid of the Terminal.app try starting the Terminal.app and enter the following commands:\ncd ~/.Trash\nls -lu\n\nThis may result in something like:\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 otto  staff  700416 Jan 26 23:33 MyRemovedFile.txt\n\nwhere 23:33 is the value which should show up in the 'Date Added' column in Finder.\nCould not test this with iTunes, but hope it may give some clues for trying to solve your issue.\n\nA: Too late now, but for future reference, Finder has an 'Undo' feature just like most other apps. \nCmd/z will undo your last action, even if you accidentally trashed a thousand items in one go. \n", "Q: Do AppleTVs show up in AirPlay by proximity? So it is weird, I cannot find any details online, but we just set up multiple AppleTVs in our office for meeting rooms today. They are hard wired to our network which is connected with our WiFi network. All access points and hardwired devices connect to the same network switch/router.\nIt seems that somehow devices know which AppleTV they are near, as only the nearby ones (within about 40-50 feet) show up as options in AirPlay. Does anyone know if this is a feature, or is it a problem that we need to troubleshoot? (Don't want to have a big client meeting and then scramble to get a something working to show work.)\nThank you.\n\nA: The 6.1 update added airplay discoverability via bluetooth to the Apple TV, and it sounds as though this is what you are seeing, especially since the distances you mention are not dissimilar to bluetooth ranges.\nFrom Macrumors:\n\nThis change allows Apple TV to search for connectable devices over\n  Bluetooth, bypassing Bonjour and making it easier for education and\n  business administrators to set up iOS device and Apple TV pairings.\n  Previously, Apple TVs could have a difficult time discovering devices\n  on networks that might block Bonjour.\n\nAt the time, it required an iOS 7.1 device and did not work with a mac, but apparently this feature was added in Yosemite:\n\nUnfortunately, this Bluetooth Discovery feature has not been available\n  for Macs, which is why your iPhone/iPad can see the Apple TV and your\n  Mac cannot. Fortunately, with the latest beta release of Apple's\n  Yosemite OS, this appears to be working now (Hooray!)\n\niOS 8 added a peer-to-peer airplay system for third generation Apple TVs, however since your Apple TVs are on the same network as your other devices it seems less likely to be what you are seeing (though it could be useful if you have guest presenters).\n", "Q: shutdown or suspend in parallels I use Windows 8.1 in Parallels. Daily in evening for 5 hours, I open my C++ primer book (PDF) and code in Visual Studio. I feel little lazy in closing the book and Visual Studio everyday. Should I suspend Windows for resuming it from that very place next day? Or suspending Windows has some negative sides on machine/Parallels/Windows? Please let me know if there are down sides.\n\nA: Suspending a VM should not have a negative impact on the guest OS. As far as the OS is concerned it shouldn't be much different than going to sleep.\n", "Q: iMac stuck at white screen - graphics issue? I have a mid-2007 iMac that can't boot into OS X Lion unless it's in safe mode. When I turn it on, the Apple logo appears, then the loading spinner, then a white screen with no cursor.\nWhat makes me think it's a graphics issue is that when I boot into Lion recovery, the white screen doesn't get replaced completely by the \"steel\" background - rather, dragging the Installer window around kind of \"erases\" the white and lets the steel through, like how the eraser works in Photoshop. I'm thinking this could be related to the graphics card driver, as in safe mode it loads fine and I'm assuming it uses a generic driver there. I've tried the OS it came with (Tiger), and that installs fine but won't boot, only this time getting stuck at a blue screen instead. Oddly enough, Apple hardware test says everything is okay.\nI've replaced the hard drive, reset the PRAM and SMC, and done a memory test, and I was wondering if there was anything else I could do or if my hypothesis is correct, finding an alternate way to use the graphics card.\n\nA: To determine if it is your hardware or OS X boot from external drive. If it works it is your OS X, if not, it is your hardware.\nIf it is OS X use Safe mode and:\n\n\n*\n\n*look for non apple drivers loaded using sudo kexstsat in Terminal (enter password)\n\n\nA: in safe mode, go to folder /System/Library/Extensions, then move the files starting with ATI to another folder for example Extensions_tmp. Reboot, now system should be ok, but with reduced graphic capability. try to find the previous versions of the ATI files in your backup, and move them to the Extensions folder.\n\nA: Unfortunately it does appear to be a graphics issue, as when I removed the ATI kexts in safe mode and restarted, it booted fine, though with abysmal graphics performance as it was using the generic drivers.\n", "Q: Can I install iBitterlich forestry app on an iPhone 4S I would like to get an iPhone 4S to run iBitterlich but\ndon't want to get internet service for the iPhone. If I buy an iPhone 4S somewhere, can I download the app via wifi to my HP Pavillion 6 laptop (and it's internet), and run it without any internet service on the phone?\n\nA: Yes, you can, although if you can connect your computer to wifi, it seems like you can connect your iPhone to wifi. The standard way to install apps on an iPhone is to connect it to wifi. However, assuming that isn't possible for you, it is easy to install via iTunes.\nFor more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Apps Via iTunes\n\n*OS X Daily Article\n", "Q: Why does my command line prompt now beging with \"vpn\"? I was just (unsuccessfully) playing around with setting up a vpn in OS X Server, and now all my new terminal prompts begin with \"vpn\" followed by my user name. Anyone know why this is the case and how I can revert back to my default prompt, without \"vpn\"?\n\nA: SuperUser has a similar question/answer.  I thought this was covered here already, but couldn't find it. \nFound it!\n\nA: As you were setting up the vpn it got changed.\nThat can be changed in System preferences - Sharing - Computer Name.\nUse Edit to change the name to your liking.\n\nFirst it shows the Machine name, then your user name.\nIn my case myMBA:~ Buscar$\n", "Q: How can I add a website to Notification Center after denying its initial request?

And even If I send an email to a colleague and he forward that email - the name with my emoji stays!\nIs there a way to hide the way I save contacts when I am sending an email? I know that an email can have a First and Last name attached to it as default, can I show this somehow?\nI am using Gmail account, Unibox app for mac to send emails, and all my contacts are synced between my devices.\n\nA: Use the nickname field instead.\nafaik, that doesn't transmit. (At least, no one's ever complained to me about what I call them ;)\n\nA: It seems to me the only answer is to always BCC my contacts, because then the names I have given them in my address book will not appear. It seems very strange to me now that recipients can see information from our address book, I haven't noticed it untill a contact for weirded out by his strange coded name I'd given him for my address book to be more useful. \n", "Q: iTunes disable command by trackpad Since a few months, iTunes is listening to the track-pad fingers command previous and next (3 fingers swipe) even if it's not the active application (ie: has focus).\nThis is extremely annoying when browsing the web and listening to music. How can I disable this shortcut that I didn't set up ?\nI've searched in the trackpad settings, the itTunes ones and the keyboard => shortcuts but didn't find the solution.\nBTT screenshot: \n\nA: Problem is related with 3rd party app called Better Touch Tool. As OP showed on the screenshot - commands Previous and Next assigned to gestures, refer to Track change in iTunes not going back/forth in browser history.\n", "Q: Why would I want to update the iOS on my iPad 2? I have an iPad 2 which I have neglected to update for some time now.  The iPad uses iOS version 6 currently.  iOS 6 has never given me issues the way i use my iPad so Should I update to the new version?\n\nA: The reason that has gotten me finally persuaded to update to iOS 8 was the fact that more and more apps called for mandatory update and would otherwise refuse to run. The one that immediately comes to mind in NFL Game Pass. Also my kids told me that some of the games they wanted to play wouldn't run on iOS 6.\nI must say that I was a little afraid to upgrade as I was expecting performance issues on part of iPad 2... I am pleasantly suprised though - there are of course minor lags here and there, but it's not like the update has rendered the iPad unusable - on the contrary. \nSo all in all if it's just a matter of preference - it's entirely up to you whether you do it or not, but if you have essential apps calling for the upgrade, I don't see a reason to stay with iOS 6.\nI hope that has shed some light on the matter for you.\n\nA: No, I certainly recommend that you do not upgrade. It is unfortunate that you don't have iOS 7, but in any case, I upgraded my 3rd generation iPad to iOS 8 and noticed an immediate performance difference. The keystrokes were almost always delayed by roughly a word. They have fixed that problem as of some of the .0.1 versions, though. Still, I have observed a number of people upgrade and wish they hadn't. The fact is that after you upgrade, there is no going back. \nIf everything is working as it is right now, stay with it. If you need something that runs iOS 8, then go with that. \nAlso, keep in mind that iOS 8 has the potential to be the last option for the iPad 2. If this is the case (and you will know after WWDC, likely), then you will always have the option to upgrade, even after iOS 9 comes out. \n", "Q: Photo viewer for Mac that can rotate (and save) pics while browsing folders I am coming from Win and I am so disappointed by Mac's usability so far. My current problem is with maintaining photos. I usually take lot of pictures with my DSLR and I want a very simple solution to:\n\n\n*\n\n*browse through pictures where they are - without the need to copy them to some library like in iPhoto\n\n*ability to easily rotate one or more of them at a time - unlike in preview where you can rotate only one picture in only one direction\n\n*they should stay rotated(!!!) after I close the program - unlike x mac apps that I tried that do not save the rotation, which is totally useless\n\n*large/full screen preview, with easy way to jump to prev/next photo without any headache inducing animation\n\n*I want to know the number of pictures in a folder without going to a special menu like in Finder\n\n*I don't want to spend more than $1-$2 on this simple app. \n\n\nI am sorry if this sounds like a rant but I have tried so many options so far including spending money on useless app in the app store. \n\nA: So if you only want to spend $2 for such an app, you definitely will be disappointed in every direction you will take a look at.\nRegarding my most famous and favourite graphics manipulation and imaging software \"Graphicconverter\", which can do everything you want and described, you would pay 35€. But if you want to, you can try it out. \nhttp://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/\n\nA: Actually, there is an excellent program that will do exactly what you are wanting, and it is free. It is called Phoenix Slides. It has been around for many years and I use it for exactly the same things you are wanting it for.\nhttps://blyt.net/phxslides/ (that isn't a shortened link; it is the real URL to the developer's site)\nYou can rotate in either direction by using Shift-Cmd-L for Left and Shift-Cmd-R for Right.\nTotal image count will be to the left between the top browser section and the bottom thumbnail section.\nNote that you can also show the total file count for a folder in Finder itself by going to View -> Show Status Bar. I also suggest enabling the Path Bar as well as I find it really useful. Both options will be at the bottom of the Finder window once enabled.\n", "Q: Can I still use my own apple ID with its asociated credit card when I'm in a family sharing family? I'm thinking of setting up family sharing for our family. We're all adults, so we buy apps for ourselves, but it would be nice if we could share the apps. Will I lose the ability to buy apps with my own Apple ID if I join my family?\n\nA: No. Any apps you buy with your Apple ID will still belong to you. If you leave Family Sharing other family members will lose access to the apps (Mac OS & iOS), movies, TV shows and music that you own.\nAny family member's purchase will be charged to the credit card of the Family Organizer.  Gift cards can be used by a family member and they will be charged before the family organizer's credit card. Family Sharing will bill the family organizer's credit card even if other family members have a different credit card on file.\nHere is a link to Apple's own support document on this.\n\nA: I have a workaround: What we have been doing is we have our family account under my sister's credit card. However, the individual members of my family buy Apple Gift cards. This is credited only to the individual family member's account. I usually buy mine at the grocery store, but you can buy them online as well. A little bulky but it works.\n\nA: Family sharing is required if you wish to share Apple Music using the family plan.  It is a great idea but all purchases of members go onto your card unless they purchase their own iTunes cards and load them on their own account.  Family sharing prefers the creators card over the individual card.  $14.99 to allow all members access to Apple Music is a great deal over the $10.99/mo plan for each one to have an individual plan.  The downside is that if you are the organizer, you are likely going to spend more money for them to save since all of their purchases go onto your card.

For me post, I would have to plagiarize his work. \nDeuce55 you can ignore this update. It is directed at anyone interest in recovery partitions.\nThere are three types of OS X recovery partitions. They are either internal, external or internet based. Each type has its pros and cons. Internet recovery is the most reliable, but for my old 2007 iMac this is not available. For the 2011 iMac, it takes 33 minutes at my Internet Connection Speed of 2.3 Mbps. If you use internet recovery to do a clean install of OS X, you get the version of OS X that the computer was shipped with. This is not a problem if your computer is new, but later you will have to visit the App Store to get the last purchased version. If you have to do that, then I no longer consider the install to be clean. \nAn external recovery partion is usallly stored on a thumb (flash) drive. Using a thumb drive, for me, is much faster than the internet. You do have to download the “OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0” application to create the thumb drive, but that is a minor inconvenience.  Like Internet Recovery, it is reliable assuming you refresh the thumb drive after each major OS X upgrade. When used to do a clean install, you get the verion of OS X that was installed when the thumb drive was created. So if your OS X is current, then the clean install will also be current. The disadvantage with thumb drives is the “OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0” is “not compatible with a disk that is using CoreStorage,  including any disk larger than 2.2TB, any disk with FileVault 2 enabled, and all Fusion drives.” See System Requirements. \nFinally, there are the hidden recovery partiton(s) on the internal drives. For most users, there is only one internal drive and therefore only one recovery partition. For Fusion drives there appears to be two. Booting by using these partitions is probably the fastest. Clean installs result in the installation of the same OS X version, which is good. But consider the bad. First they can be corrupted. If your drive physically fails and you replace the drive, then you have lost the use of the recovery partition. If you delete the OS X boot partition, often the recovery partition is also deleted. Finally, if you boot using the internal recovery partition(s), you can not unmount /dev/disk0.\n\n@Deuce55: Update 1:\nA recovery partition is a small partition that you can boot to. It is used to repair or reinstall software. It can exist on your internal hard drive, on an external thumb drive or on the internet. The internet or thumb (flash) drive are the preferred choices. If you have one on your internal hard drive, it is not normally shown in the Disk Utility application. To use the internet, you have to have the latest Firmware update installed. See Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X Internet Recovery\nAny chance you would be willing to try posting the output from the commands I asked for?\nAlso, do you have a thumb (flash) drive that you can reuse? If so what size?\nAnd, do you have another computer available to communicate with while this computer is in recover mode?\nYes, you will probably what to back up your OS X partition to an external disk before proceeding. Have you ever created a .dmg image using the Disk Utility?\n\nIt looks like you are using Core Storage. If you are, then what bjb is telling you to do may not work. The resident expert on this subject is klanomath. I would recommend one of his solutions but first could you answer some questions. This would help me determine what link to create.\nWhat version of OS X?\nWhat version of Windows?\nDo you have a fusion drive?\nWhat is model identifier or Model/Year of your Apple?\nAre you using Time Machine or other method of backup.?\nIf you still have your recovery partitions, do you care if you lose them?\nCould you enter the following commands in a terminal application window and post the output.\ndiskutil list\ndisktuil cs list\nsudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0\n\nThe last one will ask for your login password. This is normal. None of these commands change your computer. They just show your current disk setup. \n\nA: If I remember correctly, if the partition type is GUID then you should be able to resize by just dragging the line that divides your partitions. You might need to delete the empty space partition first by clicking on it and hitting the '-' button, but then you should be able to drag the active partition to whatever size you want. Afterwards, you can '+' the partition back and format it for Bootcamp.\nI haven't done this in a while, but from what I remember the only requirement was that you needed to have the GUID partition type for this to work. Otherwise, you'd have to reformat the entire drive. The disk utility program should attempt to relocate the blocks that were in the space that you're now moving to your bootcamp partition.\n\nA: Preparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup 'Macintosh HD'\n\n*Start another computer or smartphone and access this page here to follow the instructions.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially an external Time Machine backup drive)\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite).\nRevert CoreStorage Volume\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the volume 'Macintosh HD' with Disk Utility and repair it if necessary.\nIf the volume is corrupted beyond any repair consider a reinstall of Mac OS X.\n\n*If the volume is OK quit Disk Utility\n\n*Open Terminal from the menubar (Utilities/Terminal) and enter diskutil cs list.

I created a Font Library or Font Collection (I don't even remember exactly anymore) in Font Book.\nI was silly enough to add a very large amount of non-previously-installed fonts into such Library/Collection (around 1000 of them). It might also be relevant to add that all those fonts are stored in an external hard drive. So when I added all those fonts, my computer just froze.\nNow, the problem, is that I cannot even start Font Book anymore. Whenever I try to launch it, my computer would just freeze. My guess is that it is trying to configure all the fonts but is unable to finish. I already tried leaving it on for several hours with the Font Book open, but it did not solve my problem.\nI think that I should just delete the Library/Collection without launching the Font Book and restore its default settings during the process.\nHow can I achieve this? Has anyone encountered such problem before?\n\nA: You can use Pacifist to reinstall Font Book in your system. It will ask you if you want to replace it. You will need an image of your OS in an accessible pack.\nDon't know if you can 'rm' the folder's content. Never tried, but fonts must be installed in the user's location and not in the System folder.\nI think with 'setenv' we can link external folders with custom organized fonts to system/paths.\nI'm working around because for years I used many fonts and tried to reorganize them with a minimal system set and no third-party apps like FontExplorer or others.\n", "Q: Cannot add gmail account to iOS I just had a major hack and had to change password.\nApple mail will not accept my new password with Gmail, so I cannot add that mail account.\n\nA: As was suggested to you in the comments, you will need to provide more information in order to get some relevant help\nGenerally speaking the steps to follow are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your password and write it somewhere.

A few years ago, it was realized that using number generating RSA keyfobs for authentication into VPNs was not a completely secure mechanism. Some companies that previously relied on RSA for this have migrated to using SmartCards with PINs instead. Combining this with enterprise products such as Citrix Receiver have worked pretty well so far.\nWith the release of OS X Yosemite, Citrix no longer works with SmartCard authentication. Both Apple and Citrix have acknowledged this, but according to the forums on those sites, it doesn't seem like a heck of a lot is happening to resolve the situation. As a result, people who use Macs at home to remote desktop to their office are unable to upgrade to Yosemite since it means that they'd no longer be able to work from home.\nI'm curious if anyone has any idea or insight as to what exactly changed with Yosemite and why would it be taking so long for either Apple or Citrix to come up with a fix? You would get the impression that either Apple has completely broken the support and just doesn't care or Citrix can't get an engineer to make some tweaks.\nAny idea as to what exactly was the breaking change and perhaps why would this be such a difficult problem to fix?\n\nA: Now I don't know the answer to your questions, honestly, it's something only Apple can address with proper justifications and references. But your impression is correct, they just don't care. Back in the day I used to use my government CAC to log in to my system (not for websites, that was my login method), it was hacky and took a lot of sudo commands to accomplish, but worked. That went away with Mountain Lion, and further more, sending an encrypted email with a smart card is torturous, something that should be a priority (personal security) above all else. Such a shame because I loved being able to do that as opposed to a traditional phrase passcode. However, I can still use my CAC for government computers, the same with Mavericks, with a 3rd party application. And this is not a sale, i don't know anyone from this company but it's just an example, just saying there are 3rd parties out there, but I ended up shuffling 30 bucks together just to get on my normal work websites. You can look into it pKard honestly though, you best solution and the more sane in the long run, install Windows with boot camp.\nYou can review their forums regarding your issue here but it seems like its a locally approved process for this particular software.

Automator has a Set Application for Files action which says:\n\nThis action selects the application used to open the specified files.\n  If an application is chosen, it overrides the default application used\n  for the type of file.\n\nA Folder Action type of automator workflow could be set up to detect when new files are added to, in your example, the Desktop folder, which would then need to be filtered down to a specific file type using Filter Finder Items and then set the application for those files.\nAlternatively, an paid app such as Hazel could do the legwork on detecting which folders and files you wish to change, and have it run a simpler workflow which would only need to set a desired application on any files it is given.\nThe problem, as I see it, would be what happens when you move those files out of that folder (in your example, off the desktop)? They would still have their non-default application set. With the above methods, one solution would be to have a separate folder for \"cleaning\" which acts in the same way, only setting the application back to your chosen default.\nI believe it may be possible to do watch for files added to and removed from a folder using the Applescript Folder Actions which can also be added to a given folder, but it's not something I've experimented with.\n", "Q: My ISP's web interface is blocking OS X Server?

I browse to a folder, then expand through a directory tree to find the file I'm looking for.  Now I want to create a folder at the current location within that tree.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"New Folder\" from the menu creates the menu in the top-level directory instead of the current directory.\n\n*Right-clicking doesn't give any way to create a folder \"in-place\" - ie with reference to the file or directory I currently have clicked/highlighted.\n\n\nSimplified example (thanks soulshined):\n/Users/user/Downloads/\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic1.jpg\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic2.jpg\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic3.jpg\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic4.jpg\n/Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic5.jpg\n\nThe finder window is opened on the /Users/user/Downloads directory, but I have used the tree-expanders to be looking at the files in .../Downloads/Pictures.\nI want to add a folder under Pictures, but irrespective of how I invoke it, the new directory will always be created under Downloads.\n(Obviously in this example it would be trivial to move it, but imagine the folder is a byzantine corporate shared directory tree,...)\n\nA: This is how I create new folder in the Finder (list view) with keyboard only:\n\n\n*\n\n*↑↓ (up/down arrows) - Highlight the folder\n\n*CommandO - Open the folder on the same tab\n\n*CommandShiftN - create new folder\n\n*type the name of the folder Enter\n\n*CommandOption8 - go back to the previous folder (same as back button click)\nInfo: The 5. step is same as Command[ shortcut, but I use hungarian keyboard and for the [ character I have to hit the Option8 combo.\n\n\nOn windows + total commander I only had to press F7 button to create new folder :)\n\nA: As of OSX Catalina, \nCommandShiftN Creates a new folder within the folder within the open window (in your example, the ~/Downloads directory). File > New folder, the context menu, and the Actions (gear) menu have the same behavior, regardless of what is selected.\nThis is inconsistent with pre-Catalina in my experience. I don't know why this changed. The only method is to double-click the Pictures directory first. \n\nA: The problem is that List View displays the contents of several folders at once, but it is only 'in' the top level folder that is listed in the Titlebar. The New Folder command behaves the same as in other views, for the sake of consistency. (That's Apple's take on it, whether you agree or not.)\nFo those who want it, I've create a very simple Automator Quick Action that seems to work when you right click on a folder in List View.\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        \n        set thefolder to (input as text)\n        \n        make new folder at thefolder with properties {name:\"New Folder\"}\n    end tell\n    \n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: There's no built-in way to do that in Finder (as of macOS 12 Monterey, 2021), but you can create a custom Automator action instead. This will provide a right click menu item, as well as a keyboard shortcut, to create a folder under the selected folder in Finder. (This answer builds upon the excellent answer by Benwiggy by adding a dialog prompt, keyboard shortcut, and expanding/selecting the new folder.)\nStep 1: Create the Automator, Quick Action\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Automator and click File > New\n\n\n*Choose Quick Action\n\n\n*On the right side, select \"Workflow receives current: folders in Finder.app\"\n\n\n*On the left panel, select Library > Utilities > Run Applescript. Drag Run Applescript to the right panel.\n\n\n*Copy and paste the below code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    set SELECTED_FOLDER to (input as text)\n    \n    # prompt for new folder name\n    set NEW_FOLDER_NAME to text returned of (display dialog \"Name of new folder?\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"OK\"} default button \"OK\" default answer \"\")\n    delay 0.1 # prevent UI race conditions\n    \n    # create new folder \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set NEW_FOLDER to make new folder at SELECTED_FOLDER with properties {name:NEW_FOLDER_NAME}\n    end tell\n    \n    # expand new folder \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set selection to SELECTED_FOLDER\n        activate # need to activate before sending keystroke\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        # requires System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility: add Finder.app\n        key code 124 # right arrow to expand folder\n        delay 0.1 # prevent UI race conditions\n    end tell\n    \n    # select new folder\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set selection to NEW_FOLDER\n    end tell\n    \n    return input\nend run\n\n\n\n*Click the \"Hammer\" button to compile and get syntax highlighting.\n\n\n*File > Save. Name the script create new folder here.workflow or whatever you want.\nStep 2: Create a keyboard shortcut\nNow add a Keyboard Shortcut for the Quick Action you just created:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Preferences > Keyboard > Services > Files and Folders\n\n\n*You should see the create new folder here item listed.\n\n\n*Click Add Shortcut and assign the keyboard shortcut cmd+shift+M or whatever you want.\n\n*\n\n*Note: I originally wanted to assign cmd+shift+opt+N since that was simply opt plus cmd+shift+N, the built-in keyboard shortcut for Finder's New Folder. But that shortcut didn't work for some reason, it just beeped. So I chose cmd+shift+M since it was next to cmd+shift+N.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Grant permission to send keystroke to Finder\nThis is necessary because expanding the Finder folder requires sending the right arrow keystroke, which requires additional permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\n\n*Add \"Finder.app\" (/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app)\n\n\n*Make sure Finder.app is checked.\n\nA: I think the key bit here is:\nYou have first to double-click the directory within which you want to create the new folder.\nSelecting File->New Folder (or Shift-Command-N) won't create a new folder in the current folder (or at least what I would consider to be the current folder)\nFor example, in the image attached, I would expect \"New Folder\" to create a new folder inside folder1 (selected) - instead, it will create it in the \"Guest\" folder - which was the originally opened folder. \nTo create it in folder1, you first need to first double click folder1.\n\n\nA: Open the folder that you want to create a new folder in, then File > New Folder or Shift-Command-N. \nOR \nYou have first to double-click the directory within which you want to create the new folder. Once you are inside, right-click and select \"new directory\".\n\nA: Here’s a script you can use for this. It works both in list and column views. The renaming part doesn’t work properly in icon and gallery views, which can be annoying.\nTo use it with a shortcurt, I exported it as an application from Script Editor and set a shortcut to that application in Butler. I used the standard Finder shortcut for “New folder”, since I don’t need icon and gallery views, but you may prefer something different to still be able to use the regular shortcut. Note that the app must be granted accessibility permissions (System Preferences › Security › Confidentiality).\nYou may want to adjust the delays to your system’s reactivity, as they can be annoying if you’re used to type the new folder’s name quickly after it’s created.

When I first signed up for AT&T U-verse I had a 2Wire 3801HGV modem.  I was able to set up web hosting using the server app and Phusion Passenger for my Ruby on Rails applications running Lion Server. Even upgrades to Mountain Lion and Mavericks did not mess up anything.  Everything worked as before.\nA few months ago all my U-verse services quit working well. The wiring was updated to CAT-50. My modem was changed to the Motorola (Arris) NVG589.  Now web browsing is slow at best and my web hosting no longer works.  Either my websites do not display at all or they display with no images.  I assume the DNS is set up properly for the web hosting because the correct websites show up.  I did a clean install of Mavericks and put the same DNS settings as I had when everything was working.  I also did a Server Hardware Test just in case something was wrong with my hardware, especially the memory.  No problems with the hardware were found.  I came to the conclusion the problem is with the NVG589 modem.\nI did some web searching on the AT&T site and others and found that the problems I describe occur with the NVG510 and the NVG589 because of a known software bug where the DNS check times out really quick before most websites can display. The only option I have (I guess) is to make my Time Capsule the main router.  I found a solution in several places, including the AT&T forum.\nI have two questions regarding this:\n\n\n*\n\n*It was suggested that if the Device IPv4 Address is the same subnet as my personal router's LAN segment that I should change the subnet on my personal router (aka Time Capsule) to something like 192.168.10.0.  How can I change this number in Airport Utility (or some other tool)?  I could not find a way to do this.\n\n*The steps also say to disable the section on the NVG589 where I opened ports 80 & 443.  I know that theses ports are already open on my Mac Mini server.  How do I open them on the Time Capsule?  Right now I am in bridge mode at the advice of an Apple specialist while trying to solve another problem long ago.  When I change the router mode of the Time Capsule to DHCP will I be able to open ports using Airport Utility (or some other tool)?\n\n\nIf I cannot resolve this I have lost my development server where I need to be able to test my websites assigned to a domain before deploying to my production server.  I checked the AT&T website and the only modem mentioned for AT&T U-verse is another modem that looks similar to the one I have.  Maybe it will work but I just wonder.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I'm going to take it that you're reading something along the lines of these instructions from dslreports.com. If so, to answer your questions:\n1) What you're looking for is if the public (WAN) side of the network is using their own DHCP-allocated address pool for the network branch your area is provisioned with. This would be IP addresses that start with 10.x, 192.x or 172.x. These are the same IP ranges typically used for LAN addresses issued by DHCP servers on internal networks. The instruction is to use one of those address ranges that does not match that of the WAN side of the AT&T modem. So let's say that your modem has a 192.x.x.x WAN address: set your Time Capsule to use the 10.x.x.x address range in its DHCP settings. This will prevent matching and conflicting IP addresses as packets are transferred through the modem, as the modem is performing a basic NAT function in relaying the packets.\n2) Yes, you need to disable any of the port forwarding done on the NVG589 since all the packets will now need to be handled by the Time Capsule. @colomb's answer shows the configuration section of the Airport Utility where you would need to set up the new port forwarding rules, as well as what mode to operate the Time Capsule in. The \"Network Options\" button at the bottom of his screenshot is where you will set the DHCP address range for the Time Capsule as well as enabling the NAT Port Mapping Protocol.\nThe end result of all of this is that the NVG589 will now effectively be just a modem for the AT&T service and your Time Capsule will be your router and DHCP server with your port forwarding configuration.\n\nA: *\n\n*Do you know if it's possible to put the U-Verse box into bridge mode? That's the customary approach for using Time Capsule as router. If you can do that, you'd attach the U-Verse box to the WAN port on the TC, and set the Internet tab on the TC to DHCP. If no bridge mode, it's tricky, since you don't want to be doing Double-NAT.\n\n*If you can get 1. above sorted, you can set up inbound port forwarding in Airport Utility, in the Port Settings of the Network tab. This may be invisible to you if your TC is in Bridge mode at the moment, but it can definitely be done.\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Watching 720p and 1080p Movies on a 4K or 5K Monitor I want to buy a 4k or 5k monitor but I'm worried about watching 720p and 1080p movies on it.  I have a 24\" 1920x1200 monitor that I watch lots of movies on and just wondering how would I watch movies on a 4k or 5k monitor if it has much more pixels?\n\nA: Assuming you're talking about playing the movies on your Mac, the Mac will scale the picture up or down to the appropriate pixel size. If you've ever watched a DVD, or DVD-quality, video on your current monitor then you've already seen this in action because the native DVD resolution is only 480 or 576 pixels high. Conversely I can watch 1080p HD video on my iMac with only a 1680x1050 screen; the Mac scales the video down to fit.\nAlternatively, you can set the Mac's display resolution to 1920 x 1080 and let the monitor do the scaling.

I'd like to run a Freeboard.io dashboard (HTML+JavaScript) on an older iPad to visualize a bunch of things persistently. This would be fine as a Safari home-screen-ified app, except there's no way to prevent display sleep without globally changing the iPad's lock settings.\nIt's easy enough to programmatically disable sleep in an iOS app, but I don't want to pay $99/year for an Apple developer account just so I can make a UIWebView in an app that disables the sleep timer.\nAnd yes, Panic's Status Board exists—but apparently it's buggy and not being actively developed anymore. It's more sensible than a $99/year subscription, but still not ideal.\nWhat I'd love is the equivalent of Fluid.app for Mac, just for iOS and obviously with the option to disable the sleep timer.\nDoes a suitable iOS app exist, or would Apple reject any candidate because it'd be nothing more than a UIWebView wrapper?\n\nA: See here. Google basically reloads the page, and then stops it reloading.\niosSleepPreventInterval = setInterval(function () {\nwindow.location.href = \"/new/page\";\nwindow.setTimeout(function () {\n    window.stop()\n}, 0);\n}, 30000);\n\n\nA: You have two issues to your question. Now this answer doesn't actually assist you in resolving your issues, however it's more accurately an answer than a comment so I acted accordingly. \nFirst, an app can only directly effect the device with Public API processes while its active, or with special permission, while its in the background. The idle timer in this case, is an active state reference, so there would be no way a developer could alter this in the background (while using Public API and fulfilling App Store requirements). So no, no app can directly alter that setting in the App Store for any tasks outside of its bundle. This is probably a security issue to Apple that's why they don't allow it. For example you could set my idle timer off without even asking my permission but turn my screen black to emulate a locked device and use that for whatever reason you see fit (take pictures videos etc)\nSecondly,\nThere are App Store guidelines but they seem to vary based on Apples mood for the day. Some apps get rejected for being a 'Website wrapper' while others don't. It's unfortunate but been a living breathing dragon in the App Store ecosystem. So it's hard to say they will reject it because no one really knows until you submit it. Is it worth it in your case? No. Because your alternatives are cheaper. \n1) Jailbreak your phone. 2) ask a developer to just ad hoc an app to you. Based off your description you just want a web view and the timer set off, doesn't seem like a troubled development \n", "Q: How can I wipe my iPhone to start over with Find My iPhone active? I want to get rid of an old email Apple ID on my iPhone 5s. At this point I just want to wipe the entire phone clean and start over. How can I do that if I can’t turn off “Find My iPhone”?\n\nA: This can't be done with Find My iPhone active. You need to disable Find My iPhone before you can erase/restore the device.\nIf you restore the device in restore mode, then you will enter Activation Lock.

Now that Microsoft's released Outlook for iOS, does anyone know if it will sync calendars, contacts and tasks with Outlook on a Mac?\n\nA: If you mean directly, then no. It's primarily intended to use Exchange server to sync those.\n\nA: Like most mobile clients, Outlook for iOS does not sync with data that is local to your Mac.  Instead, it communicates directly with the server that your mail/calendar/etc data resides on.  It syncs directly with Exchange 2007 or later, Office 365, Outlook.com (including legacy hotmail.com and live.com email addresses), iCloud, Yahoo! Mail, and Gmail.  It doesn't allow you to set up a generic IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV account in the first release.\nThe chances of having Outlook for iOS (or any other mobile client) sync with local data instead of cloud data is extremely low.  Most people want to have the same view to their email, calendar, and contacts everywhere, regardless of which device (and whether it has synced lately with its home computer) they are using.\n", "Q: Does Windows, running on latest Apple computers, see boot disk partitioned as MBR or GPT? From my understanding, the newest apple computers boot Windows in EFI mode. Traditionally, Windows has seen the boot disk as an MBR partitioned disk. In fact, the boot disk (i.e. /dev/disk0) has aways been partitioned as a GPT disk. I would like confirm there has been a change.\nTo be specific, open a Command Prompt as an Administrator and enter the following:\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nexit\n\n\nNote: When entering the diskpart command, it can take a while before the first prompt appears. This is normal. Be patient, the DISKPART> prompt will appear.\n\nWhat I am looking for a * in the Gpt column for Disk 0. If Disk 0 is seen as an GPT partitioned disk, then Windows has booted using the EFI boot method. Otherwise, Windows has booted using the legacy BIOS boot method. An example, using an older apple (iMac/20 inch/Mid 2007), is shown below:\n\nIn the above illustration, Disk 0 is the internal hard disk partitioned as a GPT disk. To Windows it appears as an MBR partitioned disk, indicated by the absence of the * in the Gpt column. Disk 1 is a GPT partitioned USB thumb (flash) drive containing a single NTFS partition. \nIf you show a * in the Gpt column for Disk 0, could you report back the \"model identifier\" or \"model/screen size/year\" of your apple computer. It may also be useful to include the version of Windows and OS X you are using. Apple recommends a standard where there is one partition for OS X and a second Boot Camp partition for Windows. If you are using a nonstandard partitioning scheme, try to indicate how you differed. \n\nA: If you install Windows with the Bootcamp Assistant from a standard Mac OS X system, Windows always will start from a PMBR/Hybrid MBR partition table embedded in the GUID partition table \n(Legacy MBR). MBR takes precedence in hybrid configuration even if a EFI boot might be possible.\nIf you use a non-Bootcamp Assistant EFI install method for Windows (e.g outlined here) Windows will boot in UEFI-mode (compatibility Windows 32bit/64bit) and you will find a * in the Gpt column for disk0.\n", "Q: MacBook keeps booting into system installation after failed installation I did try to install Mavericks from the original installer package onto a separate disk via Firewire. The machine used is a MacBook Pro which is newer than the Mavericks package. As usual, after starting the installation from the desktop, the system rebooted to perform the installation after a minute or so. After rebooting it got stuck on a grey screen with a slashed circle on it. I did remember that Apple some when in the past introduced this nice feature to prevent installing an older MacOS on a newer Mac, so I booted into the recovery mode and installed on the external disk from there. So fine, so good - but when I unplugged the external disk to reboot into my normal system again, I ended up on the grey awful screen again - looks like the Mac insists to continue the failed installation which is not possible. Using the option key on booting to select my normal boot partition does not work, it does not show up. So I assume the installer has put something to mark this system as installing. I don't want to reinstall my entire system to get rid of it for several reasons. So now comes the question: What did it put there? I can handle a bash to clean it out manually, if I just knew what and where.\nThanks in advance,\n  Peter\n\nA: Use Internet Recovery to reinstall the correct build of Mavericks for your machine, your user account and applications will be unaffected.\nWhen you've done that, re-download a fresh copy of the Mavericks installer from Apple. This will be the latest available build (10.9.5) and you should have no further problems if you install from that. I'd recommend you build a USB installer from the Mavericks installer so you don't have to worry about a hard disk failure, lack of internet connection etc. To do this you can use 3rd-party utilities or follow this procedure. Download the Mavericks installer but quit it when it tries to run. Take an 8GB USB stick and name it Untitled. Then run this command in Terminal...\nsudo /Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\"/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\" --nointeraction\n\nAs you noted, you cannot install an unmodified version of OS X on hardware newer than the OS X build, regardless of where it's being installed to.\n\nA: Boot from the recovery partition, open a Terminal from the menu. On the volume, there is a file and a directory:\n.IABootFiles\n.IAProductInfo\n\nRemove these. Exit the terminal and set the startup volume again. Reboot.\n", "Q: Create custom shortcuts and assign them to F keys I recently migrated to OS X 10.10 from Ubuntu 14.04 (Linux). In Ubuntu, I could make any key of my keyboard do anything I liked. I used to have the F1, F2, and F3 keys set to function as the red, yellow, and green buttons at the top left of the screen (which are the same as in OS X). This was ridiculously useful, and I want to do this on my Mac, but I don't know how I can.\nI've already used Karabiner to map the current functions of the F keys to their Fn + F* equivalent. So instead of lowering the brightness with F1, I can do so with Fn + F1.\nI have read that you can add a shortcut by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources, and then clicking on the + icon. But using Yosemite, my + icon is not there, so I cannot add the \"close window\", \"minimise\", and \"maximise\" shortcuts. Besides, though I can see in the shortcut list that some shortcuts use F keys, I'm not able to assign F keys to any shortcuts myself.\nSo I would like to:\n\n\n*\n\n*In particular, make shortcuts to close, maximise, and minimise and window. (In general, create customised shortcuts to do anything a terminal can do.)\n\n*Assign this custom shortcut to F keys, overriding F keys' default behaviour to adjust screen brightness, volume, etc.\n\n\nA: First of all, You don't need Karabinier to change F* keys behaviour. It can be done in Preferences -> Keyboard -> Use all F1, F2 etc. as standard function keys.\nThen to assign keyboard shortcut to Terminal You have to switch to Shortcuts tab, select Application Shortcuts then click + sign. There You can choose application in which this shortcut will be working. There's also text input to enter Menu Item name (for example: Close, Minimize etc. check how it's named in Your Terminal app). \n\nNOTE: There's no Maximize Menu item, I can find only Close and Minimize.\nIf You want to install 3rd party app for this, I'd recommend Better Touch Tool where You can set a lot more actions to keyboard shortcuts and mouse/trackpad gestures. Here's an example for BTT:\n\nPicture 1 taken from osxdaily.com\n\nA: I have been using Apple Scripts. Would have trouble detailing a lot of the things, but if you are coming from Ubuntu, this should be easy for you to use and no need for a 3rd party app. Here is an article that covers some basics for Yosemite. http://www.automatedworkflows.com/tips/\nThere are a ton of quick courses also.

Crucial mirrors this statement.\nAccording to the datasheet you linked, the Kingston RAM is 667MHz.  I believe when it comes to RAM, the machine simply lowers the frequency to a consistent level in order for the RAM to be compatible across the entire computer.\n\nA: Unofficially, your iMac supports up to 32GB (4x8GB) so yes you should be fine. Apple (and others) generally quote memory specs with reference to memory types available at the time of design.

I have a larger, external monitor connected to my MacBook Pro and have arranged it such that the dock is in the external monitor (via System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement, by dragging the white bar to the larger screen). This works fine, except for the fact that every now and then, the dock will suddenly shift back to my MacBook screen, but when I open up Displays to change this back, the white bar is still on the external monitor. So I have to drag it to the smaller screen, and then drag it back to the external monitor. \nIt's a minor issue, obviously, but I've noticed that it has been happening more and more frequently and it's getting quite annoying. Perhaps there's something I've been doing unintentionally for this to happen? \nI'm using Mavericks, 10.9.5. \n\nA: I also found this 'feature' annoying as you expect the Dock to be on one screen then you accidentally move the mouse to the bottom of the second screen and the Dock moves across. The easiest way to get it back is to move the mouse to the bottom of the screen you want the dock on. Sometimes you have to move it up then back down to get it to move.\nPersonally I found two options that helped me with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*At work I have my external monitor on a stand that sits behind my MacBook and arrange the screens so that the external monitor is just higher than my Macbook Screen then in the settings move the screen layout so they sit on top of each other. In this layout only one screen has a bottom as the external monitor is an extension to the Macbook Screen, thus stopping the Dock from moving. This layout also saves on desk space if you have a narrow desk.\n\n*At home I use a monitor side by side but set the dock to auto hide, then when I need to get to the Dock I just scroll down to the bottom of whatever screen my mouse is on to get the Dock. Because the Dock is always hidden and comes on when I want it I don't seem to find it annoying like I do when it is fixed at the bottom of one screen.\n\nA: You can summon the Dock on a different display by moving the cursor to the bottom of the desired display, and then continuing moving down. It may be possible that this is occurring when you inadvertently perform that action.\nI answered a similar question: cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays.\n\nA: If you can't drag the mouse down due to stacked monitors, or due to some other resolution differences between monitors.  Go to System Preferences → Dock → Position on screen → click Left, and the dock will move back to the primary monitor.\nThen you can go to the Bottom screen and follow the steps to summon the Dock, and it will return there.\n\nA: Apple didn't account for the over/under monitor configuration, the overhang catches your cursor and summons the dock.  In this case, the switching is constant and annoying. \nOne workaround is to put the dock on the side of the monitor, which will prevent the summon when the overlap catches your cursor.\n\nA: The action that summons the dock to the opposite monitor is not very intuitive for me.  This is what worked for me.\n\n*\n\n*Don't hold the mouse button down.  (When people say \"drag\" the mouse, that usually implies with the mouse button held down.)\n\n\n*The target area of the cursor needs to be at the bottom area of the monitor which doesn't currently have the dock at a place where the cursor can't move further down, i.e. this doesn't work on vertically stacked monitors along the area where the cursor can cross between screens.\n\n\n*Once the cursor is \"blocked\", pause a sec, then continue the motion downward.  The dock will be \"summoned\" to this monitor from the other monitor.  This works for vertically stacked monitors as long as there is some place where the cursor is \"blocked\".  If not, the cursor will just move to the other monitor since it is not \"blocked\".  If you have identical resolution monitors, this will probably not work per @Geraldus_US's comment below.  In that case you probably need to either left dock or right dock per @Geraldus_US.  Alternatively, unplug the auxiliary monitor and the dock will switch to the main monitor.\n\nA: In Mac OS, the Dock shifts to that monitor where you made a downward gesture at the bottom (or where the dock is usually positioned). \nThat is, if you moved your mouse pointer further in that direction (as if going out of screen), it's an indication that you are looking for the dock. So Mac brings the dock there!\nLook at the diagram below (yellow block is your monitor):  \n\nWhen cursor is blocked at bottom, moving the pointer further down brings the dock on that monitor. Can't use the words scrolling or dragging as you don't need to click/hold or use 2 fingers. It's just a normal mouse move. \nSo the cause: Probably you are someone like me who likes to leave the cursor at the bottom of the screen on one monitor while watching movie or keyboard-only coding/development, and then accidentally swipes/moves down the mouse/trackpad. Happens with me all the time. \nUpdate: I just noticed that on the trackpad, it's not just a quick swipe.\nYou have to swipe-down and hold on the track pad. It does nothing when you lift your finger quickly like a normal swipe gesture.\n\nA: To prevent this from happening type the following in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock position-immutable -bool yes; killall Dock\n\nThe Dock will stop moving.\nThe above domain and key was removed by Apple:\nApple has removed this position-immutable key from the defaults configuration because it was producing high call-volumes at IT helpdesk.  Users would disable themselves by locking their Dock onto a phantom unreachable monitor. So now this command has no effect. You can verify this with command: defaults read | grep \"Dock\" which will report no such such key. Read more with man defaults and defaults -help.\n", "Q: File's image well displays PNG icon not actual PNG I would like to replace the standard icon for an Automator application that I created with a PNG.

(I was trying to get a new transparent icon the image for a Hard Drive and all I was getting was a standard PNG graphic but when I used the slider, it changed to my new icon. Go figure.)\n", "Q: Screen saver settings keep defaulting back to National Geographic Photos I like to use my photo library for a screen saver (have 10,000 photos - it's nice to get to see them more often), but ever since I've downloaded Yosemite, every time the computer goes to sleep, it defaults back to the National Geographic photos (there are maybe 30 of them).  Really, really frustrating, and I can't find where to change the default settings to try and make an adjustment.  Anyone know how to change that default setting or have any other idea what to do?\n\nA: After trying the other \"fixes\" and nothing worked, I went with what was previously suggested here.  Located the Nat Geo folder (HD>Library>Screen Saver>Default Collections>1-National Geographic) and removed those pictures.  This does require your Administrator Password. Then I moved the pictures I wanted into that folder. This works, but it is not a fix as the Screen Saver still defaults to that folder.\n\nA: @Charley3's answer did not work for me, as I constantly update the photos I want in my screen saver. I took it one step further by setting up the mac to copy the photos from my folder to the default national geographic folder once a day on weekdays:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal application \n\n*Type sudo crontab -e\n\n*Type your password \n\n*Type i and then paste the following: (03 7 is 7:03am, change to desired update time. 1-5 is Monday-Friday, change to desired days)\n03 7 * * 1-5 cp -a <path to screensaver photos desired>/* /Library/Screen\\ Savers/Default\\ Collections/1-National\\ Geographic/\n\n*Type [esc] :wq and hit [Enter]\n\n*Type sudo crontab -l and verify the information pasted in is correct\n\n\nNow I can have the photo folder that I change the contents of daily still be set as my default screensaver folder.\nEdit: In addition, I selected the 'shuffle slide order' checkbox in screen saver settings but that too shifts back to the defaults. In order to check this box regularly, I used this question and added an additional line to the crontab:\n03 7 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser 'ShufflesPhotos' -bool \"true\"\n\nA: I had this same problem. For me it was caused by a configuration profile that was overriding my screensaver preferences. (I had installed the profile while going through Apples OS X Support Essentials book)\nHere are Apples instructions :\nRemove a configuration profile from your Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Profiles. If you\nhaven’t installed any configuration profiles, the Profiles pane of\nSystem Preferences isn’t available.\n\n*Select a profile in the Profiles list, then click Delete (-).\n\n\nA: It's very frustrating that apple has done nothing about this bug. If you search the forums, a lot of folks have this issue.\nIf you look at the apple forums there are a couple of workarounds but no fixes. \nTwo things work for most folks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the national geographic folder, delete the pictures there and move your screen saver pictures to that folder\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave the screen saver preferences always running (never close the window)\n\n\nSome of the other solutions offered have mixed results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the national geo picture folder (works for some, others get a \"no pictures message\")\n\n*Deleting system \"plist\" files (works for some, others claim the problem - returns after a while). \n\n*Disconnect your system from the internet (Not sure why but some folks claim when not connected to the internet the screen saver does not revert back). \n\n\nA: This is not a fix, but a work-around. Goto preferences and in screensaver select your personal photo folder you want to use, in the upper lefthand corner select the yellow (minimizer button) the screen will zoom down to the dock thereby locking your selection open on the dock. Not a fix, but at least you can see your own photos.\nThis is the only thing I've found that works—picked up from a post somewhere else.\n", "Q: Mouse and Keyboard on MacBook Air mid 2009 don't work partially My MacBook Air mid 2009 worked for 3 months without any problems on Yosemite.\nTwo days ago the built in mouse stopped working along with the built-in keyboard. Right after it woke up from sleep mode but the light is still on.

I've been using rsync fired by a LaunchDaemon written in tcsh for several years now. It worked great on my 2008 MacBook Pro under Snow Leopard. I now have a 2014 MBP running Yosemite. I've cleared up a few conflicts, but one continues to elude me. My script works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I mount an external drive.\n\n*launchd starts my script\n\n*My script verifies that the right drive is available.\n\n*My script copies some folders from my wife's computer to mine and from mine to hers.\n\n*My script sends a shutdown command to my wife's computer.\n\n*My script copies some folders from our backup computer to mine and from mine to it.\n\n*My script sends a shutdown command to our backup computer.\n\n*My script copies some folders from my computer to the external drive.\n\n*My script sends a shutdown command to my computer.\nAs I said, this worked fine for several years under Snow Leopard. Now that I'm running Yosemite, steps 4, 6 and 8 fail apparently without generating any errors. In the original script, I used osascript to launch an Applescript that checked a few things and then told System Events to shut down the computer. When this failed to work in Yosemite, I switched to a simple shutdown -h +1 command right in the tcsh script. This made step 8 work correctly, but did nothing for steps 4 and 6. Ideally, I would like to get back to the Applescript shutdown command because it seems cleaner: Applications get a chance to close out or even cancel the shutdown if necessary.\nOne more point I should make is that I'm using ssh -f into the root user on the two other computers to send the shutdown commands. I've set the computers up with my computer's RSA keys to enable a passwordless login, so the current command is just ssh -f root@wife.local 'shutdown -h +1'.\nI have confirmed that it works to ssh to my wife's computer and shut it down manually. It is only the script that does not shutdown the other computer.\nHas anyone any idea of why this is not working in Yosemite. More importantly, any ideas of how to make it work? I would like to be able to set the backup running and then head to bed knowing that the computers will shut down when the process is completed.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I think I have found the cause of the problem, or at least a supposed explanation and a way to do what I want.\nIt turns out that shutting down the computer seems to be simply forbidden from a daemon. I imagine that Apple considers that to be some sort of security risk, but I have not found any information about it. The one bit I found was a comment that daemons are not allowed to launch a GUI with a link to Mac Developer Library, Daemons and Agents. For what it's worth, I must have been mistaken when I wrote that Step 8 worked when I used shutdown -h +1 because I had to use this other solution in all three shutdown steps.\nSo, the workaround seems to be that I need an agent to watch for a signal from my daemon to shut down the computer. I'm running the main script as a daemon because it needs root access to copy files from several different users. The agent is running on each computer that will need to be shut down and the main script runs on my computer. When the main script is done with a particular computer, it sends the signal to shut that computer down, including my computer when the main script is finished.\nI'm sure there are better ways to do it, but my Unix and scripting knowledge is very spotty, so I have simply set the agent up to watch a particular folder for a particular file to show up. When that file shows up, the agent deletes the file and runs the osascript command to shut the computer down. So, the signal sent by the main script is simply touch /Shutdown/Now. It's complicated, but it works well enough for me.\n", "Q: MacBook boots automatically when opening lid. Feature or problem? When my 13\" Retina MacBook running Yosemite is powered off and I open the lid, it immediately starts booting up... without pressing the power button.

On a Mac, entering a non-breaking space is very easy. On my iPad with iOS 7 installed, I want to enter a non-breaking space. But I find no way.\nI have tried the mic on the keyboard. It gives me this :\nEspace insécable\n:-)\nI would prefer a solution coming from the keyboard. I would also like a palette offering characters or snippets.\n\nA: Find one in a web page (even a page you create yourself, inserting  ) and then copy it to the clipboard. Paste it in when needed.  \n\nA: In my jailbroken iPhone4 with iOS 7.1.2 I have installed Persian Keyboard iOS5+ from the BigBoss repository in Cydia. For my native language Farsi, this keyboard has non-breaking space near the Space button.\nIn the image below I have typed the translation of the non-breaking space in Farsi نیم‌فاصله which the correct form is the last line with non-breaking space between ‍نیم and فاصله. The middle line has normal space and the first line has no space.\n\nIf your device is jailbroken maybe there are alternatives for the keyboard in the Cydia repository for your preferred language.\n\nA: This is a bit convoluted, so hopefully someone comes up with [a lot] better. On your Mac, create a note with a non breaking space (option+spacebar on Mac) in a known position. Now open that note, select that non breaking space (I found that tricky), & copy it. Go to Settings > General > Keyboards > Text Replacement. Tap the + at the top right, paste the non breaking space as the Phrase, & something as the Shortcut (I used nbsp). When you use it you need to type a space before typing your shortcut, & iOS will insert a space after you select the phrase. That's a regular space either side of your non breaking space that you need to delete.\n\nA: For a palette with all Unicode characters, try Unicode Pad.\n\nA: I was able to setup a keyboard replacement text mapping “&nbxp;” to a non-breaking space, which I copypasted from a Numbers spreadsheet originally created under MacOSX. Note I had to substitute “nbxp” for “nbsp” because stackexchange seems to interpret the HTML code! Probably a bug.\nHere it is if you need it “ “.\n[addendum: OMG I copypasted the character between the “ quotes above back into my Numbers test rig, and for all the world it looks like the nonbreaking space made it through!

I bought a new Macbook pro the other day and I set up my mail account on it. It started syncing mail from about two years ago. I was worried that it might be storing mails on the storage disk and since I have the 256gb SSD, I didn't want the space to be taken up by emails from ages ago. I just wanted to know whether it does store a copy of the emails on the storage drive and if so, is there any way to just let it sync emails from only the last two months or so. \n\nA: Some of it will depend on the type of mail account (POP vs. IMAP) but yes, the Mail.app will store your emails from your accounts on the system drive. How much space it will consume depends on whether there were lots of large attachments to those emails. There is no way, though, to selectively on store emails from a limited timeframe - it's all-or-nothing.\nAs a point of reference, I have emails going back over eight years for 10 different accounts and the total size of the email and attachment storage is just over 9GB. I'm probably somewhat unusual in regard to how long I hold on to emails. But 9GB for that seems reasonable and I have no problem having those same accounts synched on my MacBook with a 250GB drive.\n", "Q: Which RAM will be better? Cheers!

There's a good set of instructions here on how to use tmutil to accomplish that.\nOne of the other options you have is to do your clean install and then use Migration Assistant with your Time Machine backups to restore all your files and settings.\n", "Q: My early 2008 MacBookPro has a different DVI and the adaptor I need is not in stock anywhere My early 2008 MacBookPro has a different DVI to later 2008 and the adaptor I need is not in stock anywhere\nI am considering putting Apple TV from my Humax to enable my MacBook Pro to link wirelessly\n\nA: According to my research, it is called Micro DVI.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-DVI\nIt looks like it can be found here.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=micro+dvi+to+vga+adapter&tag=googhydr-20&index=electronics&hvadid=25104013878&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=474849483470589268&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_4bxv9jd5o7_b\n\nA: As far as I know, the early 2008 MacBook Pros have a dual-link DVI socket, and don't need an adaptor at all for DVI output, just a DVI-D cable. The late 2008 models have Mini Display-Port, and need an adaptor to do DVI. Note, however, that DVI only carries video, not audio, so you'll need separate audio cabling if you want to do audio.\n", "Q: Can't update apps in iOS App Store; can only Open On my iPhone, the App Store has a badge saying \"2\". When I open the App Store and go to the Updates page, there are two apps at the top, which for a split-second say \"Update\" and then immediately change to \"Open\". But the \"2\" badge remains. The apps are in the \"Pending updates\" section.\nSo I can't even update these apps if I wanted to, because either they have already updated or they are preventing me from updating.\nI already tried hard resetting my device but no luck. I'd rather not take the extreme route of restoring my device if possible. Anyone know of any other solutions?\n\nA: I had same problem and fixed it by closing the app down then reopening it, selecting the updates tab, then quickly press on 'update all' before the app updates revert back to 'open'.. You only have a split second to do this but it did work\n\nA: Force quit the App Store (open the App Store, then hold power until the slide to power off slider appears, then hold home until the app quits), then reopen it and go to the Updates tab. Let it refresh the list and the problem should be resolved.\n\nA: Which iOS are you using? There is an issue where it won't update but opens when you press \"update\" if you're not on the iOS 8.x versions. The only way to update is click on the app and it'll take you to the details of the app, then you can update. \n", "Q: OS X Yosemite: System slow and using a lot of RAM I noticed that my OS X sometimes goes very laggy and it does everything slowly. I opened up Activity Monitor and I saw that it's using a lot of memory.\nAny ideas on how to fix this (because I guess it should't be using 3.98 GB out of 4 GB + 1.75 GB of swap memory)?\n\n\nI'm using mid 2012 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: As noted in the comment it had probably something to do with the WindowServer.\n\nNow regarding the other part of the question:\nOS X presents memory usage in a different way when comparing to say MS Windows.\nFor example, if you quit an app in OS X, its memory is available to other apps, but it is not 'cleared' (so if you relaunch the app it would be quite faster in most cases).\nMy MBP is currently showing 7.88 GB (\"Memory used\" our of 8GB total), but everything runs as smooth as after restarting (Memory pressure is minimal). \nI suggest you read the How to use Activity Monitor, especially the section about Memory, where you can find some additional information.\nLong story short, you better check the \"Memory Pressure\" indication graph in order to have a more accurate idea about your system's current status.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Mid 2012 startup chime from right speaker only After installing a ssd into my Macbook pro mid 2012 (not retina), i noticed that the startup chime is coming only from the right speaker. (I am not sure if it was always like that or if its because of the installation). However when I am in the OS, both speakers work perfectly fine. I reseted the NVRAM a couple of times already. Is the chime supposed to come out of the right speaker only?\n\nA: I am pretty sure your MBP always did that. It is something annoying I never really liked about the MBP: They have a \"subwoofer\" which is situated on the right-hand side of the MacBook. So sounds with a lot of bass always appear to come from the right speaker. Here is what Apple says. \n", "Q: Questionable Wi-Fi problem on MBP: how to analyse it?

But recently I've run into an issue. When I try to browse to folders recently created using the \"Save As...\" dialog, they are not visible in the Finder. Mysteriously, they do appear in applications' \"Open\" and \"Save As...\" dialogs. I have to relaunch the Finder (I used killall Finder in the Terminal) to get the folders to show up.

In this situation I'm unable to connect Apple Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter cause of no free ports.\nNext step I tried to connect monitors using Daisy Chain function this way:\nOn first monitor I enabled \"Daisy Chain\" function. On second (and the last one) I didn't change anything and left it disabled. Now I connected supplied cable (DP to MiniDP) to first monitor to DisplayPort and the other side (Mini DP) two second monitors MDP input. Than I connected only one cable (from first monitor) to first thunderbolt port of my MacBook Pro. Only thing I got was display mirroring. Two of My Dell's was mirrored.\nMy question is - Any chance two run it using Daisy Chain functionality? As far as I know MacBook thunderbolt ports compatible with MiniDP but...\nAny chance to solve it?\n\nA: Any Mac that supports DP 1.2 technically supports daisy chaining.  However, OS X does not yet support it.  If you boot Windows on your Mac you will be able to daisy chain. \n\nA: Modern Mac's (the hardware) properly support DisplayPort MST daisy-chaining but Mac OS X (the OS) does not support it. This has been proven via BootCamp with Windows. So theoretically Apple could chose to issue a patch to fix the OS and make it DisplayPort 1.2 compliant but they've chosen not to. \n\nA: Is your MacBook a late 2013 or mid 2014 (Thunderbolt 2)? If not, there is no chance to support DisplayPort MST (Multi Stream) which allows you to daisy-chain two of the Dells. The late 2013 and mid 2014 macbook pros have thunderbolt 2 with DisplayPort 1.2 (Thunderbolt 2), all the other macbook pros with retina just have DP 1.1 (Thunderbolt 1) which does not support MST.\n\nA: Just FYI: I got same setup, and while being totally inconvenient, it actually works if you plug in both screens via the DisplayPort connector.\n\n\nA: Thunderbolt is an active technology, Display Port is passive.\nTo daisy-chain, you must use Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt. You cannot daisy-chain Display Port.\nYour solution may be to find a 3rd party Thunderbolt -> dual Display Port box, but it's not something I've investigated, personally. Google gives this for starters.\n", "Q: Updating to OS X 10.10.2 broke Quick Look previews for HTML files After updating to OS X 10.10.2, I can no longer use Quick Look on HTML files – I just get a blank preview window, and the issue persists through a reboot.

Once you completely disable the account, it will no longer show up on the login screen.\nIf you have older versions of OS X, follow the instructions below:\nDisabling Guest User in OS X Lion, Mountain Lion\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on “Security & Privacy”\n\n*Click the lock in the lower corner and type in your administrative\npassword to unlock the control panel\n\n*Check the box next to “Disable restarting to Safari when screen is\nlocked”\n\n\nA: Open Terminal and run\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer guestAccess -bool NO\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AllowGuestAccess -bool NO\n\n\nA: The easiest solution I found was to go to \"Directory Utility\" (You can use spotlight search to find this),\nOnce at the panel, unlock the padlock on the bottom left of the panel.\nGo to directory editor, make sure the \"viewing\" tab is selected on \"Users\"\nThen go to the search bar on the panel and type in guest.\nYou will see \"Guest User\" under the search bar and select it\nThen press the minus button on the bottom left of the panel.\nThen, you restart your computer and then tada, its fixed!\nThis solution came from a official apple software engineer and it actually worked, however since this problem came apparent to the engineers they decided to fix this in the next update coming soon. So maybe you could also hold tight for a little bit and the issue will fix itself.\n\nA: I just tested this on 2 iMacs one from 2012 and one from 2009 both running Mac OS 10.13 and both have 2 login possibilities: the user's login button and an \"Other\" login button which asked for inputs for user name and password. \nThe true culprit here is whether “root user” is enabled or disabled. Here is how to check and disable root user if necessary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the users & groups pref pane and unlock it with an admin\npassword. Click on “login options” in that pane.\n\n*Click the edit or join button a dropdown will appear \n\n*Click on the Open Directory Utility button. That takes you to the Directory Utility pref panel and you need to unlock that with an admin password.\n\n*Once that is unlocked from the Directory Utility Menu Bar at the top of screen select edit. If you see “Disable Root User” click on that and it will\nchange to “enable root user” meaning the root user is not logged onto\nthe system.\n\n*Back-track your steps and re-lock each pref.pane.\n\n*In Users & Groups you should have already turned off Guest User. Double\ncheck that the Guest User check boxes are still unchecked and now the\nselection for Guest User should be completely grey.\n\n*Go ahead and log off your user id under the Apple Menu and the resulting action should bring a login screen with the primary login name and password ONLY.\n\n\nWhen Root User is enabled your login screens will always present an “Other” login button. Root user should only be active under special circumstances. Keep it disabled as the norm.\n\nA: I no longer have an OS 10.8 Mavericks system to test on, but I think from your description that you had a real user account named \"Guest\" and deleted it. That enables the special Guest account, the one that's automatically created on each login and destroyed on each logout.\nTo disable that one, go back to System Preferences → Users & Groups → Guest User (he's baaack...), and uncheck \"Allow guests to log in to this computer\".\n\nA: Enabling the root user may result in an option of guest login at login window even if you have no guest user option anywhere at all. So, disabling the root user will keep guest user from appearing at the login window. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012 has instructions on how to enable and disable the root user.\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu choose System Preferences.\n\n*From the View menu choose Users & Groups.\n\n*Click on the lock and authenticate with an administrator account.\n\n*Click Login Options.\n\n*Click the Edit button or Join button.\n\n*Click the Open Directory Utility button.\n\n*Click the lock in the Directory Utility window.\n\n*Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK.\n\n*Choose Disable Root User from the Edit menu.\n\n\nA: If disabling won’t work, then you can also delete the account. The account does not exist in a default installation, but is only created when it is first enabled in Users & Groups.\nsudo dscl . -delete /Users/Guest\n\n\nA: Use the below command on terminal:\nsudo fdesetup remove -user Guest and tap Enter.\nIt will ask for the admin password.  Enter that password and the Guest user login will be removed.\n\nA: Enabling root user may add the option of Guest User at the login screen.

Please explain briefly why repairing of permission is  one of the maintenance tool for mac os x exclusively .\nWhy it isn't done on windows?\n\nA: Only because OS X offers a convenient way to repair permissions shouldn't be taken as an indicator that other operating systems don't need similar functionality as well. At least in the Linux world it depends on the distribution whether something similar is available and how it is run (e.g. periodically via cron).\nAs for the \"why is this required in the first place\": Software is usually not bug-free, neither are Installer applications. So permissions may get changed in unexpected ways over time. Having a function to repair them may save a lot of time wasted for hunting such issues down.\n\nA: Windows does actually require equivalent permissions fixes, it's just that there is no built-in tool to do it all automatically.\nAnalogous processes such as sfc /scannow etc or any of the suite of tools from tweaking.com provide easier user access to those underlying system tools.\n", "Q: What is analogous to the Windows registry in Mac OS X? I am new to Mac and was wondering where application/OS settings are saved.\n\nA: For typical macOS applications the place for this kind of information is one of\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library (for OS specific stuff)\n\n*/Library (for system-wide preferences/settings valid for all users)\n\n*~/Library (for user-specific preferences/settings)\n\n\nand the folders beneath them (e.g. Application Support and Preferences). \nThey are saved as individual files, usually named so you can identify them and with a structure which is (at least most of the time) understandable by mere humans. Most of these files are Property List files ending in .plist which can be pretty-printed into a human-readable form by running plutil -p NAME-OF-FILE.plist in Terminal.\nFor applications and binaries coming from the Unix world you‘ll also find the typical dot files and directories in the home directory of all users using them, e.g. .bashrc or .ssh/.

Every graphic-heavy application I have used has recommended storing files it uses on a separate disk from the boot disk (preferably an SSD), however with the new MP this isn't an option. The only way to utilise a second drive is as an external drive.\nI'm assuming this isn't a problem in terms of performance, and from what I've read MPs are very performant, but why is this? Why can a Mac Pro get away with a single drive when most apps recommend using separate drives for boot and resources? \n\nA: Thunderbolt 2 supports data rates of up to 20 Gb/sec. The newest SATA spec, V3.2, only does 16 Gb/sec. There should thus be no difference in performance between an internal SSD (connected via SATA) and an external SSD (connected via Thunderbolt).\n\nA: The \"store files on a separate disk\" advice is for many reasons, one of which is getting an extra read/write head into the process. As SSDs have no latency, and bus speeds are many times faster* than they used to be, the main reasons are mostly no longer valid.\nIt's still a good idea for other reasons, but on a Mac Pro an external Thunderbolt drive won't slow you down any especially if it's spinning storage.\n\n\n*\n\n*133MB/s for PATA vs multiple GB/s for PCIe\n\n", "Q: MacBook pro internal speakers mute my internal speakers on my macbook pro just stopped working, they have disappeared from the sounds preferences control panel. the only option is 'optical digital outport'\nthe headphones still work, but there's a red light coming out of the headphone jack\nhelp?\n\nA: Before doing this you'll need to disable kext signing.

Basically this seems to be happening when I am multitasking with iTunes playing files stored on my local SSD, Safari open with multiple tabs, and a text editor / IDE for work, and I may have Preview, Excel and Mail open too.  I have the Macbook Air Mid 2013 with i7 processor, 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD, on Yosemite (pretty sure it happened on Mavericks too).\nWhen my laptop hangs, the music is stuck on a frame and it just keeps on repeating it over and over.  At that point the entire system is non responsive.  The display, the keyboard, the sound, it's like flipping on a light switch but the bulb stays on.  The only thing I can do is hold the Power button to force restart.\nI suspect a problem with iTunes, but it could be with the OS itself.  The problem is I don't have any crash report or stack trace to make sense out of this and the problem happens maybe once a week or two.\nHow would you guys troubleshoot something like that?\nEDIT: please bookmark this if you have the same problem.

I need to replace the original internal SSD (256GB) with a 512GB that has Time Machine on it and up to date.\nI am hoping it were not required to involve yet a third disk - e.g. another USB hard drive in this process .. but am not clear on it.  Let us call this 1TBdrive \nSpecifically it seems one solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*attach the 1TB hard drive and make it the time machine backup.  \n\n*power off the MBPro and physically swap the 256GB with the 512GB\n\n*attach the 1TB USB hard drive and boot up, keeping the option button pressed to induce booting to time machine\n\n*restore from 1TB TM to the new 512GB internal drive\n\n\nUnfortunately I do not possess this 1TB external drive.  So is there any way to do this with just the first two SSD's?\nUPDATE Here is the relevant available disk space info\ndf -k\n\nFilesystem                        1024-blocks      Used Available Capacity  iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1                          243915264 235014420   8644844    97% 58817603  2161211   96%   /\n/dev/disk7s2                        499771696 214002444 285769252    43% 53500609 71442313   43%   /Volumes/os2mellyrn\n\nNotice the externally attached SSD used for TM (disk7s2) still has 280GB available = more than twice the internal (active) SSD (disk1)\n\nA: As I understand the question, you don't need another disk. But be careful if this is your only backup.\nIt's possible to clone the current bootable drive (256GB) onto the same drive as your Time Machine Backups (512GB with 280GB available), so that it contains a working system and is bootable.\nIt should possible without third party tools, but it's definitely possible with them.\nTake SuperDuper! for example. From their FAQ:\n\nHow do I store a bootable backup side-by-side with my Time Machine data?\nIt's actually really simple. Assuming the Time Machine volume is\n  properly partitioned and formatted for the Mac (as \"GUID\" for Intel\n  Macs, or \"Apple Partition Map\" for Power PC), and is boot compatible\n  to start with, just use \"Backup - all files\" with Smart Update to\n  store a bootable backup on the drive. Your Time Machine backups will\n  be preserved.\n\nCarbonCopyCloner is another example of software which can probably do this, but I've not seen the exact details in their knowledgeable. It could certainly do the cloning, but you'd want to make sure it didn't mess with the backups assuming you have need for them later (moving them off when you get a new larger drive, etc).\nBut, if you don't need those backups in the future and are prepared to erase them, then you could just format that drive and make a bootable clone of your current system on that drive.\nNote: The recovery partition would be a factor here. I'm not sure what, if anything SuperDuper! would do to create one. I know CCC will work with them.\nNote 2: If needed you can reconnect your Time Machine with one of the methods explained here.\n\nA: Sure it works but you have to create, clone/TM-restore and erase various volumes:\nI assume your internal disk is disk0 containing disks0s2 as your internal start volume and your external disk is disk1 with disk1s2 as your Time Machine volume.\nWithout loosing your TM Backup:\nThis only works if the sum of used space on your TM-volume and used space on your main volume is smaller than ~ 500 GB (to leave some recommended free space on the interim main volume disk1s3). In your scenario the sum is ~449 GB so it works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a partition (disk1s3) on the 512 GB SSD with the size ~256 GB (by splitting disk1s2). That should work without erasing disk1s2\n\n*Clone disk0s2 (your current main volume) to disk1s3 (or restore your TM-backup on disk1s2 to disk1s3), then restart from disk1s3\n\n*Erase disk0s2 and clone disk1s2 to disk0s2 (or backup disk1s3 to your now new TM-volume disk0s2), then erase disk1s2\n\n*Clone disk1s3 to disk1s2 and restart from disk1s2\n\n*Delete disk1s3 and expand disk1s2 to the full size. If that doesn't work start from disk0s1 (your internal Recovery HD) or to Internet Recovery mode and try again.\n\n*Just reinstall your current system on disk1s2 to create a Recovery HD if none is existing without loosing any (personal) data (e.g if you are running 10.0.2 now just download the latest Yosemite installer and reinstall).\n\n*Swap the drives\n\n\nLoosing your TM Backup (not recommended):\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase disk1s2\n\n*Clone disk0s2 to disk1s2 and restart from disk1s2\n\n*Just reinstall your current system on disk1s2 to create a Recovery HD if none is existing without loosing any (personal) data.\n\n*Swap the drives\n\n", "Q: How can I keep my home address private when sharing my vCard? Instead of handing over cumbersome (and likely to get lost) business cards, I like texting my vCard. However, I'd like to not share some of the information in my vCard—most importantly, my home address. Additionally, I taught Siri my entire extended family, which now gets shared with everybody I send my vCard to. This feels less than professional.\nHere's the problem: I need my home address in my card if I'm going to get directions to Home using Maps. And I want Siri to know who's in my extended family. But I don't want to share this information when I share my vCard.\nI sync my contacts through iCloud, so I was looking at my Mac's Contacts app to see if it had a solution. In Contacts preferences, I found this promising option: \"Enable private me card\":\n\nWhat I was hoping for with a \"private me card\" was a way to set which pieces of information to share and which ones to keep private on a per card basis with just this one special \"me card\".\nThe only other solution I can come up with is to create 2 cards: \n\n\n*\n\n*one for my own private use via Siri, Maps, etc\n\n*and another for sharing.\n\n\nThe downsides of this solution are that \n\n\n*\n\n*it's inelegant (two vCards for one person) and \n\n*if a piece of information changes, I have to remember to update two cards, not just one.\n\n\nAre there other options out there I haven't considered? Are there preferences in iOS, OS X, and/or iCloud that would solve this? And what is a \"private me card\"?\n\nA: Working Solution :\nEnable Private Card as you discussed in the Contacts Preferences. Then go to your card. (you can find your private card the one with the head silhouette). Then click on edit, and a bunch of share options will populate to the right of all the fields. Select the ones you wish to share and that will be the only information that is sent when you share you card. \n\n\nA: UPDATE \nAs of 2022 and iOS 16 we can finally choose which contact information to share... previously this was not possible on iOS, only macOS.\nFrom iPhone and iPad\n\n*\n\n*Open the Contact app or the Phone app and tap Contacts.\n\n*Tap and hold the contact you want to share and pick Share from the menu.\n\n*Tap Filter Fields.\n\n*Uncheck the fields you don’t want to share and tap Done.\n\n*Now, share your contact via your preferred medium like Messages, Mail, WhatsApp, etc., and only the selected details will be shared.\n\n", "Q: XCode change Comment SYMBOL I know how to change key-bindings.

Is there any way to copy an event in iCal in iPad or iPhone and paste it to a different day? At times, I want to keep the original calendar entry, but repeat on a different day? I am not looking to use the repeat function, as that forces one to use more predictable repeat.\n\nA: Aside of using the duplicate and repeat there is no copy/paste function.\nYou can submit a request for the function at http://www.apple.com/feedback/\n\nA: I think maybe Apple's team wish users use the Repeat->Custom function when adding an event to create multiple entries of the same thing.\nYet, I also agree a copy/paste feature is highly lacking there...\n\nA: A work-around:  email the event to yourself (or create a new event in a new email to yourself).  Hover the cursor over the event in that email, click the down-arrow that appears, edit the date, and then \"Add to Calendar.\"  You can do this for as many dates as you like.\n\nA: I have \"CalenGoo\" on my iPad -- and there's a drag and copy feature which I find indispensable!!

Check it out.\n\nA: I was looking for this as well when trying to input my work schedule (I work in shifts). The solution I found is to manipulate the repeat function in the following manner: Add the event, select custom repeat \"every month\", select the applicable days of the month, and finally set the custom repeat to end on the last day of that particular month. It's a hack, but it works. One does wonder why there is no copy/paste feature though...\n\nA: Not as such, but I'm using next workaround for non recurring events\n(it looks complicated, but try it out, it works quite fine):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the event to be repeated e.g. Every Day\n\n*Go to the repeated event on the day you need it and set the Repeat back to None and hit the Done button.\n\n*Then change the time or add a note, if needed.\n\n*When closing the event, a pop-up message appears telling This is a repeating event and prompting you eighter to Save For Future Events or to Cancel.\nChoose Save For Future Events.\n\n\nResult: you have the event copied.\n\n\n*Now, go back to the original event and turn the Repeat function back to None.\n\n\nResult: The original event is not recurring any more.\nNote: You can use the same trick to Copy recurrent events as well. But then, in step 5, you need to go to the next to last of your wanted recurring events and delete it.\nChoose Delete All Future Events.\n\nA: You can not copy/paste an event but you can repeat an event for N-days in a row by using repeat/custom/1 day till end-date for the repeat.  \n", "Q: Linking between tables in Numbers I have a table in numbers, and I want a cell to equal the value of a cell in a different table.

I'm developing an app that has absolutely nothing to do with anything other than specific external audio-related hardware. While running my app in the iOS simulator, I got a message from my LittleSnitch (that's a firewall) that the process geod (iOS) is trying to access irs.gov. As if that wasn't enough, the next attempt was to azadiradio.org. I blocked both but I'm wondering: what is going on within my iOS simulator?\n\nA: This sounds like a classic case of bad reverse DNS. Note that both the IRS and azadiradio.org are at least partially hosted by Akamai's servers. This can lead to some confusion for people trying to do a reverse DNS. Your simulator might be trying to access some other server (could be Apple's, they also use Akamai) and Little Snitch tries to translate that IP address into a domain.

I'm lost with the interface for iMovie 10.0.6. I have created iMovies with previous versions of iMovie (the most recent being iMovie 9).  When I installed and then opened iMovie 10.0.6 on my MacBook Pro running Yosemite, it also imported every last movie and clip I'd ever used and placed them in Events and Projects with no rhyme nor reason (at least not apparent to me).  Now I can't seem to create a new Event or Project without part of a previous project being a part of it. I'm lost - obviously - and no, I'm not computer illiterate just iMovie illiterate I guess!!\nI'd love a written tutorial on using iMovie 10.0.6 that starts with the very basics but have been unable to find one -- I do better with written directions that watching YouTube videos - I need that step by step. Any suggestions from anyone?\n\nA: I wouldn't say it's for no rhyme or reason, obviously,things sorted chronologically will always be easier to find. But this is just a slight overlook on your part, very slight. You can create a new project with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*clicking on the 'Add' icon in the topbar or pressing ⌘+N.\n\n*Create with whatever theme you seem fit.\n\n*Name it whatever suits you, and select the corresponding event your creating a movie from.\n\n*This will automatically add the project to the same year or folder the event is in (keeping things together, more efficient workflow)\n\n*You know if an event has a working project if there is a movie slate next to it's name. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is a fast link to your movie.\n\n*This is where you cut/exclude/split and select certain clips to drag-n-drop into the timeline (#3)\n\n*This is your working timeline, anything you've added to the movie will display here. All transitions go here as well.\n\n*Self-explanitory\n\n\nThis is a very very fundamental tutorial, there are thousands of features packed into iMovies you might have to review their own tutorials here : http://help.apple.com/imovie/mac/10.0.6/\n\nA: Click on the import button. Click the dropdown at the top, where your events are listed, and click add new event. Name it what you like and you're done. You don't have to actually import anything. Close out the import window and go to add project. It'll be there.\n", "Q: Are links in Podcasts show notes supposed to be \"live\"? Most podcasts have show notes that describe the individual episode.  In iTunes, you can see these show notes by clicking on the episode, then clicking on the \"i\" at the right of the episode description; in the iOS Podcasts app, you can see these show notes by tapping the podcast's \"album art\" in the Now Playing screen.\nOften these show notes are written to include links to web sites, but AFAIK neither iTunes nor the iOS app treat these links as other than plain text; there does not seem to be any way to actually open them.  See for example the screenshot below; notice that in the middle of the paragraph (about five lines down) the words \"click here\" appear, but are non-functional.\n\nI suppose it is possible that the the responsibility for this rests with the publisher (i.e. maybe they are just copy/pasting text from their website and not properly coding the episode description) but if so it seems to be a universal problem; I've never seen a podcast in which this did work.  It seems more likely to me that neither iTunes nor iOS is set up to handle live links in episode descriptions.\nAm I right about this?  Are those links supposed to work?  Or am I just doing something wrong?\nEdited to add:  If the answer to this question is \"No, those descriptions don't work\", is there a better Podcasts app that does handle those as live links?\n\nA: Apple's podcast specs explicitly discuss how to embed HTML links within the Summary field: \n\nText Encoding\nUse plain text UTF-8 encoding for your podcast feed (no markup or HTML, except as described below).\nTag values are limited to 255 characters, except for , which can be up to 4000 characters. Don’t add leading or trailing spaces to your values.\nEnclose all portions of your XML that contain embedded links in a CDATA section to prevent formatting issues, and to ensure proper link functionality in the Podcasts app. For example:\n<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href=“https://www.apple.com”>Apple</a>]]></itunes:summary>\n  \n\nSeveral popular podcast clients support this —  Overcast, Pocket Casts, Downcast, among others — ,and I believe Podcasts on iOS does now as well. \nSee for example this screenshot from Macstories' review of Overcast:\n[\n\nA: The short answer? You cannot click on those links and they are not there to begin with. The reason you can read that text is lazy content management on the podcast production side; nothing more and nothing less.\nThe longer answer? Read on… The text you are referencing comes from the summary or description XML data field in the publisher’s iTunes RSS XML feed. To better understand the overall way one creates a podcast for iTunes, check this comprehensive document as well as the RSS 2.0 spec here. Here is the recommendation on the usage of the <itunes:summary> and <description> tags:\n\nTake advantage of the <itunes:summary> tag. The <itunes:summary> tag\n  (or the <description> tag if <itunes:summary> is not present) allows\n  you to inform users about your podcast. Describe your subject matter,\n  media format, episode schedule, and other relevant information. In\n  addition, make a list of the most relevant search terms for your\n  podcast and build them into your description. Note that the iTunes\n  Store removes podcasts that include irrelevant words in the\n  <itunes:summary> or <description> tags.\n\nNow, nothing in these specs explicitly references disallowing links within summaries/descriptions but I do know from being a web developer that RSS feeds can be messy to deal with to say the least. Meaning, in general, RSS feeds—and not just podcasts—are not meant to be full replacements for content; they simply act as a way to convey a quick “Hey, check out this stuff!” information about something. In this case, a podcast episode with the only link being the link to the actual podcast itself.\nSo my gut tells me the reason you are seeing “click here” text is a simple result of lazy content management practices on the podcast publisher’s side. Meaning looking at the specific TLDR episode (#44, “Prostitute Laundry”) on their actual website shows the following; screenshot attached for reference:\n\nAnd all of those links are indeed active on their website, but not in the podcast info. Meaning that the way WNYC seems to be generating podcast RSS XML data is by taking the “description” that is used for their blog post, stripping out links and extraneous HTML and repurposing it—dual purposing it?—for the podcast description/summary RSS XML datapoints. A more content-aware way of doing something like this would be to have a separate “Podcast Description” field in their content management system, but that would mean someone would have to essentially write two descriptions for each podcast which might be too time consuming.\nWhich is all to say, the text might be saying “click here” but not only is there no way to remedy that on the user end, the core reason comes down to the podcast content producer’s not making much of an effort to tailor their summary/descriptive content for different media/audiences. So when you say this:\n\nMaybe they are just copy/pasting text from their website and not\n  properly coding the episode description.\n\nYou are on the right track, but it’s more automated than “cut and paste” it seems. I would say the RSS XML generation code they are using simply grabs the description text from their database, strips the links and then sets that as the “description”/“summary” for the iTunes XML feed.\n", "Q: How to set MacBook Pro to turn off when closing lid? I want the shutdown feature to activate whenever I turn down the lid and close my MacBook Pro. It's a machine I use for work so I need the disk encryption to kick in every time I'm travelling with the Mac, and its easy to forget turning it off. Is there a setting somewhere that allows this, or is there an app/script I can run?\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a good way to do this as explained by @asmeurer in his answer\n\na shutdown in general may require user action (e.g., from an application that doesn't use the auto save model, or from an application that is frozen or becomes frozen when the OS tries to quit it).\n\nmaybe your best bet would be an app that closes everything for you every time you close your lid. However such an app would not be that much quicker than manual shut down. \n", "Q: Trashing .Trash and Emptying Trash I don't want to sound stupid, but what happens if someone were to delete the .Trash folder using Finder and emptied it.\nI know it's possible unless there is something that just stops it from happening.\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall finder can be used to show the folder.\n\n*Then go to ~/ in finder and delete .Trash.\n\n*Open trash from dock then empty it.\n\n\nWhat would happen?\n\nA: Quick answer, nothing happens. \nIf you delete it, .Trash will be created again once needed.

I use Image Capture to import photos from my iPhone. I noticed recently that it shows two copies of every photo in the Image Capture window, both in list view and grid view.\nThere is only one copy of each photo in the iPhone camera roll, and when I drag them to a folder it only creates one copy of each. So it's not really causing a problem, but I'm curious why it is happening. I first noticed it in 10.10.1, and it continues in 10.10.2\nSee the screenshot below for an example. It is displaying two copies of IMG_6173.JPG and two copies of IMG_6172.JPG. There's only one copy of each in the camera roll. If I select all four and drag them to the desktop, it will create only one copy of each.\n\n\nA: I just had this issue and found a solution on another site:\nFirst, close Image Capture. Next, dismount the iPhone from the Mac by ejecting it with iTunes and unplug the cord from the iPhone. Then, just plug it back in and open up Image Capture again. \nWorked for me - only one set of images.\nOf course, this was after trying a couple other things... like turning off My Photo Stream (Settings>iCloud>iCloud>My Photo Stream: OFF) and turning off the \"Keep Normal Photo\" option (Settings>Photos & Camera>Keep Normal Photo: OFF), but I didn't notice any change immediately after doing these things  Only after unplugging and reconnecting the iPhone did the problem fix itself.

Virtualbox complains that VT-x isn't available and running securable confirms that it's not available. My 2012 rMBP has an i7 and intel clearly states the CPU does have VT-x, nevermind the fact that Virtualbox works just fine under OSX. This is where if I had a PC I'd check if it was enabled in BIOS.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Okay so I got it working with virtualbox with the help of VMWare. I tried AnonymousAppDev's answer but it didn't have any effect on my machine (at least not after the first reboot).\nI read that VMWare may be able to turn on VT-x, so I installed VMWare workstation. That in turn asked me to remove Hyper-v since there's a conflict. After rebooting securable now says I have VT-x enabled and I'm able to run Virtualbox.\n\nA: It is supposed to be enabled. However, I searched around, and this is what I found:\n\nInstead of booting into Windows by holding the option key on startup, boot in to OS X. Then go to System Preferences -> Startup Disk and choose your Boot Camp partition. The computer will restart and boot into Windows, with virtualization enabled.\n\nThat is from https://superuser.com/questions/717421/how-to-enable-hardware-virtualization-on-a-macbook\n", "Q: How can I create a Windows 7 USB from Mac OS to work on a PC? I know this has been asked about two or three times here, but none of the solutions work. Basically I have a frozen PC, a Mac w/o virtual Windows, a Windows ISO, and a USB stick. While I initially thought that using Bootcamp will solve the problem, the Windows installer created using bootcamp is not recognized by my PC. \nAre there any solutions to creating a Windows 7 USB stick to work on my PC?\nEDIT: I've been looking around, and it seems that unetbootin might solve the issue. Does anyone have any experience with the software?\n\nA: Usually the person asking the question does not give enough information for a answer to be generated. So, I will try anyway.\nDoes, the PC have a working bootable DVD drive? If so, just use the OS X Disk Utility application to burn the iso to a DVD.\nIf your PC can boot from a flash drive, then you have two options. First, use some machine running windows to transfer the iso to the flash drive. Or, install windows 7 to a bootcamp partition on your Mac. Do not activate windows. You can use it for 30 days. Make the iso to flash drive transfer and install on the PC. Finally, remove the bootcamp partition. The last step is fairly easy, if your Mac is not using Core Storage. \nThe Microsoft software to transfer to the flash drive can be found at Windows USB/DVD Download Tool. The tool does not download software. Rather, the tool assumes you already have the iso and need to either burn a DVD or transfer to a flash drive.\nIf you edit and refine your question, I can update my answer to better fit your problem.\n", "Q: Yosemite Time Machine Backup Failed Due to Full Disk I've run Yosemite for some time now, this issue is recent. My assumption has always been that Time Machine autonomously overwrites old backups once your time capsule is full. \nSo my question is :\nHow do I resume normal Time Machine backups without having to manually erase old backups. I know I can delete files from Time Capsule\nRunning:\n10.10.2\nTime Capsule :\n461 GB of 2TB available...backup error is \n\nThe backup disk needs 536.69 GB for the backup but only 460.78 GB are available. Select a larger backup disk or make the backup smaller by excluding files.\n\n\nA: This somewhat of a long shot, but it sounds a little like you may have changed something on your disk. \"Invisible\" actions like changing file permissions or HFS+ compressing files will cause TimeMachine (TM) to assume that the files have changed and need to be backed up. Another scenario would be that the UUID of your hard disk changed. This article lists some further possibilities. So to answer your questions:\n\n*\n\n*the warning is there because you would loose all previous backups and you would be left with only this one backup.\n\n*Time Machine thinks that all files have changed. My hypothesis is that you did some action changing attributes of all files or your disk's UUID.\n\n*you could try to inherit the files\n\nI suggest you try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Compare your disk's UUID with the one used in your Time Machine:\n\n*\n\n*diskutil list and\n\n*look for a hidden file called com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeUUID on your TM disk (not too sure about the file name, because I use sparsebundles)\n\n\n\n*Full Reset of Time Machine: Read this article for details. Basically you will have to delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n*Reconnect your backup. Read this article thoroughly. You will have to use either of these commands:\n\n*\n\n*sudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/myTM/Backups.backupdb/myMac or\n\n*sudo tmutil associatedisk -a / /Volumes/myTM/Backups.backupdb/myMac/myDisk\nNote that you might loose your entire backup. Please make a copy of your Time Machine backup.\n\nA: I also had the same problem in Mac OS X Mountain Lion or Lion.\nFirst of all, your main question is true: Time Machine should remove old backups when disk comes full, and that's some strange behaviour you're having.\nWhat solved my problem was simply resetting the Time Machine preferences by removing the file\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\nWhen you do this, Mac OS will forget your disk and when you will connect it again it'll ask \"do you want to use this disk as Time Machine?\". I said yes and started a new backup, which went fine.\nAlso, I hope you're not removing old backups simply trashing folders from the Finder: to manually remove old backups you should enter the Time Machine, select the backup you want to remove and click on the gear-icon and then select Remove Backup. If you simply moved old backups in the Trash, that's not a good way to go: you probably corrupted some of the internal indexing in the Time Machine (and that's maybe why he asks for more data). As my knowledge, there is no cure for that other than erasing the disk and start a new Time Machine again.\n", "Q: iOS: open text file with not text extension Trying to get SSH private key from *.pk file.\nCurrently use app to extract this file from \"external source\" and it gives me an options to open this file in mail app / dropbox / btsync but not in notes app, for example.\nIs there any tool / app to do that?\n\nA: Being able to do that with iEditor - the only program to open any file as text.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s screen separation; what will happen when I take the device to an Apple Store genius? Today I discovered that my iPhone 5s is coming apart on its own. The front screen is intact, but has lifted by about 1 centimeter at the top left of the device. The screen backlight is separated from the glass in that area. The device wasn't plugged in or near any heat source, and showed the depleted battery icon when I tried to turn it on. This is no longer my primary phone; I bought an iPhone 6 a few months ago.\nI bought the 5s new in October 2013 without AppleCare, so the one-year warranty has lapsed. The metal band around the edge of the phone has scuffs and dings. I certainly can't prove it, but that damage happened months before the screen separation. What I suspect is happening inside the device is that the battery has altered its shape and forced the screen to detach. Or perhaps an adhesive has deteriorated.\nIf I take this phone to a genius at an Apple Store, what will happen? Will Apple take responsibility for a manufacturing defect even though the phone is out of warranty? From Apple's support website, I see that the standard out-of-warranty cost for a 5s is US$269. It's possible I purchased this phone with a credit card that offers automatic warranty extension; I can look into that.\nThe phone turns on and works. I no longer need this device, but I'd like to recover some value from it.\n\nA: Some people are saying that the Apple Store will replace it for free regardless of Applecare coverage within 36 months of purchase. Certainly worth a try. \n\nA: I too had an issue with the screen separating from the frame of the phone, in the same location. \nI took it to the Apple Store, commented that I believe it may be a battery problem, and let him run his diagnosis (no problems). He showed it to a tech in back, who said that it's not likely a battery issue, but they will replace the screen free of charge. If it turns out to be a battery issue, they will replace that as well. I got an e-mail this morning my phone was ready to pick up, but have yet to go over there and do so.\nI did have the standard one year warranty still (I purchased the phone Black Friday of 2016). I'm curious as to if they would have fixed it after the warranty period? \nAnyway - that's my two cents for any future researchers :)\n", "Q: Mechanism to sync mail accounts between Mac and iPhone Is there a way for me to create an account using my Mac's Mail app and have the account sync over to my iPhone or vice versa? I have iCloud setup on both my Mac and iPhone, but I don't see the accounts added on one device syncing over to the other. \n\nA: This was possible in Mountain Lion and before, through iTunes. Unfortunately Apple has deprecated its Syncserver service, and so now you have to set up each account separately on each device. Frustrating, I agree. \n\nA: No.\n(if what you want is a way to configure an account once on a device and have the configuration automagically transferred to other devices.)\n\nA: It is possible to synchronize email accounts between Macs. This is what the iCloud Keychain is for. Activating it will sync over all of your accounts (those listed in the Mac Accounts settings). One problem is that it is an all or none setting.\nHowever this doesn't help synchronize email accounts between Mac and iOS.\n\nA: It's not possible. However, the Apple Configurator app helps creating a .mobileconfig file that makes account creation much easier (basically you enter all the settings on your Mac then import them onto the iOS devices).\n\nA: You can use IMAP/POP3\n\nOn Mac you can add IMAP/POP3 account from System Preferences > Internet Accounts\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Internet Accounts\n\n*Click plus icon on left bottom corner\n\n*If it's iCloud mail, Gmail or Microsoft Exchange account click the option respectively, otherwise select \"Add Other Account...\" from the bottom of the list\n\n*Follow trough the guided account setup, and in the end of setting it up (if it asks) check the Email syncing option.\n\n*You can get the mail server info from your email provider, but most of them use mail.provider.tld (eg. mail.google.com / mail.ipage.com) domain for the mail server\n\nOn iDevice (iPhone in this case) open Settings > Contacts, Calendar & Email > Add new account and follow the instructions inserting the same credentials as you gave when adding account to Mac.

So right now I can start up in what ever one I want to. \n\nA: The easiest way would have been to create a time machine backup before replacing the drive, then use Migration Assistant to import your account, apps, etc.\nHowever since you replaced the drive already, you will need to get an USB to sata connector, or external enclosure, to connect the old drive in order to access the data.\nAt this point you have 2 options\n1 - Run migration assistant and point it to the external drive.  It should see your old account and allow you to import everything.  (Sometimes this fails, see http://www.hardturm.ch/luz/2014/02/fixing-os-x-10-9-mavericks-migration-from-external-volume/)\n2 - Manually copy the data, or the entire account folder.  The original account will be under the /Users folder on the old drive.   You can copy the full account if you wish, then use system preferences to create a new account with the same shortname; it will prompt if wish to use this existing folder for the new user account.  However, if you decide to try to copy manually you may run into permissions issues.  You most likely will have to reset permissions on the folders/files but you can use BatCHMOD to do this (free).  Be warned that I would not mess with permissions on the original drive in case of a problem, only work on the copies you make.\n", "Q: List USB devices on OSX command line Can I List USB devices on OSX - similar to lsusb on Linux.\nI know I can access from System Information.\n\nA: In addition to system_profiler SPUSBDataType (suggested by @kjs), you can also use ioreg -p IOUSB:\n$ ioreg -p IOUSB \n+-o Root  <class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 10>\n  +-o EHCI Root Hub Simulation@1A,7  <class IOUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000227,$\n  | +-o HubDevice@fa100000  <class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x10000027a, registered, $\n  | | +-o Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad@fa120000  <class IOUSBDevice, id 0$\n  | | +-o BRCM2070 Hub@fa110000  <class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x1000002b4, registe$\n  | |   +-o Bluetooth USB Host Controller@fa113000  <class IOUSBDevice, id 0x10$\n  | +-o FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)@fa200000  <class IOUSBDevice, id 0x100000$\n  +-o EHCI Root Hub Simulation@1D,7  <class IOUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000228,$\n    +-o HubDevice@fd100000  <class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x10000027b, registered, $\n      +-o IR Receiver@fd110000  <class IOUSBDevice, id 0x100000288, registered,$\n\nBy default it clips to the window's width (80 chars in the example above), so you may want to add -w0 to get a full-width display.

Using either the included drivers for OS 10.8.x or the official Realtek drivers from December 2014, it hard crashes the system every 5-10 minutes. I have about 120 GiB of data to transfer to a 13\" Pro Retina and no external HDD - is there a way to make the Realtek adaptor work under 10.10.x or a quicker way to transfer my data?\n\nA: It may be worth starting up in Safe Boot mode and then using a utility like Onyx to clear your system caches and see if that helps with your stability issues.\nOtherwise can you not transfer wirelessly? It won't be as fast as GB Ethernet but it would still get the job done. Failing that I'd suggest either an Apple Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, or a USB transfer cable like this (probably much cheaper than the Apple adapter).\n", "Q: Boot Camp OS startup selection not available with Windows Alt I am using iMac (Yosemite) and Logitech K800 wireless keyboard http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/wireless-illuminated-keyboard-k800 (specifically the Finnish version of it).  When I press Alt on bootup, regardless of when I start pressing it, the operating system selection menu does not appear. I have tried 30 times, with different keys etc. No use.\nIs it really impossible to go to the selection menu with a Windows keyboard?\nI do have an Apple wired keyboard connected too. No problem with the Option key and selection menu appearing with that. I just don't want to keep the Apple keyboard solely for this purpose. If there is no other choice, will http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/ help me (are there any cons with that rEFInd, I've never tried that)?\n\nA: Actually, Boot Camp installs a Boot Camp Control Panel in the Windows Control Panel. The large icon appears as shown below. \n\nAlso, Boot Camp installs a gray diamond icon in the Windows notification area (system tray). \n\nBy clicking on this icon,\n\na menu will appear,\n\nwhich allows you to easily switch back to OS X.\nUpon opening the Boot Camp Control Panel, the Windows icon will be highlighted.\n\nIf the OS X icon is selected followed by clicking Apply or OK, the default startup partition will change back to OS X without the system restarting.   \n\nThe same is true for the Startup Disk window under System Preferences for OS X.\nIn conclusion, the only functionality missing is a menu to select an operating system on start up. I suppose rEFInd would serve this purpose. I will point out there are others for which you have to pay for. For example, there is Boot Runner which has a 14 day trial period. It installs in the OS X partition and can be uninstalled. rEFInd may have problems with both installs and uninstalls.\n", "Q: Internal keyboard + touchpad stopped working, on Macbook air 'early 2014', Yosemite 10.10.2 my internal keyboard and touchpad - stopped working a few days ago.\nWhen it first happened - I made the macbook sleep-wake-up several times - and it came back to normal. External keyboard+touchpad - work normally - but internal keyboard keeps randomly 'typing' in characters for me, especially 'fn-f' keys (such as randomly muting/adjusting volume, etc).\nIf I reboot into 'Rescue mode' - they work flawlessly, but in 'safe boot' - they keep misbehaving.\nI've tried already NVRAM+SMC reset chords on startup.\nThe rate of the problem is becoming worse, that it, it's less and less likely the internal input devices will work (immediately after sleep).\nI've checked preferences and touchpad is enabled, no-keyboard-keys etc.\nAny advice? OS-reinstall? anything to post here?\nthank you! \nas suggested somewhere, I list here the non-apple kernel ext, it's only Virtual-Box, which was install about two-month before the problem appeared:\n$ kextstat | awk ' !/apple/ { print $6 } '\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp\nCan I try to reinstall the internal macbook keyboard drivers w/o entire os reinstall? thanks.\nEdit:\nOne week later update::\nSituation is still not solved, but I'm more convinced it's a \"sleep wake\" related thing:\nI was using the computer 'normally' now for a week (without shut-down, 'sleep' - only using Lid-Close).\nWhen once- I press the Menu-Sleep - on wake-up - I had no keyboard and pad. I had to close the Lid and open it several times- after 3 times - It woke up working.\nAnother time - after full shut-down (from menu) - the computer woke up (after 30 minutes when I turned it on) - with no keyboard-pad again. (last night).\nI left it on 'Lid-Sleep' - and in the morning now - it's working again.\nYesterday - also the Volume and keyboard light buttons - stopped working till reboot (sleep didn't help) - they were in a weird-state - where they would display their 'squares' showing their meters on the screen - but they would not affect the actual volume and keyboard light level. Neither did the volume control from the top-bar. (Though the volume control inside the \"System-Pref/Sound\" - still worked properly), I don't know whether it can be related, but I'm providing this hint. I rebooted because of this, and on the reboot - (the mentioned 'shut-down' from menu) and the computer woke up with no keyboard.\nWhen I find a solution I will post it as an \"answer\".\n\nA: Apple doesn't package the drivers or installers, so the best you could do is try these installs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest \"Combo\" updater for 10.x.x and install that package.\n\n*Download the entire Yosemite Installer and then re-install the OS.\n\n\nThe only downside to option #2 is you need to download more data. It is the sure fire way to ensure everything is up to date. The only downside to #1 is that it might not work. Not everything is packaged in the combo updater - just the things that were updated. So if you choose that, you might waste the time downloading the small package and trying to install it.\nBefore you do anything, try rebooting in safe mode. That would disable any third party kernel extensions and let you know if the core OS is the problem. If the keyboard works there - you might just need to uninstall your VM and other modifications.\n", "Q: Xcode 5.1.1 together with xCode 6.1.1 - simulators deleted I had Xcode 6.1.1 installed together with the iOS8 simulators but I need to be able to test websites with iOS7 also so I installed Xcode 5.1.1 also and named it to this. (I also renamed Xcode 6.1.1 to that instead of just Xcode).\nAfter that I got all iOS7 simulators in Xcode 5.1.1 working. But now all simulators from Xcode 6.1.1 are gone! When I try to add them back it just loads for a while and then nothing happens. What should I do?\nI need iOS7 and iOS8 simulators to test with, preferably on the same computer and without any virtual machine (don't have disk space).\n\n\nI have Mavericks on a Mac Book Pro Retina. Software OS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\n\nA: You don't need both versions of Xcode in order to test with iOS7 and 8 simulators. With the latest version you will be able to test in both simulators. You just need to go to Preferences → Downloads and download the iOS 7.1 Simulator. Then you can define simulators with that version on your devices window.\n\n\n", "Q: How to recover an iPad from power-off during an upgrade? I upgraded my iPad 2 from iOS 6 to iOS 8.\nHowever, I cancelled the upgrade by turning the iPad off because I thought that my files weren't backed up to a PC. I used OtA upgrade.\nWhen I turn the iPad back on, there's an image of USB connector and iTunes icon signifying to connect it to iTunes.\nWould all my files (photos, paid apps, memorable videos, etc.) still restore to my iPad if I restore from iTunes?\n\nA: No - you would need to try to back up over USB to PhoneView or a similar tool.\nOnce you're sure you can't get any data back, then connecting to iTunes can easily wipe whatever's left and then return a proper working OS onto the hardware.\n\nA: When you see the itunes logo with your charging cable on your iPad, it means that your device is in DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode.the only thing you could do now is to restore the iPad via iTunes. It is not possible to make a backup anymore.\n", "Q: How to restart a process without user interaction I killed a process (a simple .jar running in the background as a global agent) by pkill -9 java. Since the global agent in launchd is configured as keepAlive the process gets restarted immediately.\nUnfortunately this nasty popup (\"The action Run Shell Script encountered an error\") comes up and prevents the restart of the process without user interaction.\nIs it possible that launchd simply restarts the process without waiting that the user presses OK in this popup? After pressing OK the process gets restarted properly.\nEDIT:\nThe script is as follows\n\n\nA: If you terminate the java process with kill -9, the shell which called gets an error code back. In your case, the execution of java is the only command in the script run by Automator, so the error code is interpreted by Automator as a general error which triggers the popup.\nIf you add any other command after the java call (well, any which ends successfully), the Run Shell Script action will complete successfully and Automator will not even notice that the java process was terminated. This command can be something simple like : (which in this form basically does nothing) or sleep 0 (which usually exits successfully).\n", "Q: Stop Mail Changing Port for E-Mail Account I'm having an annoying problem with Mail on Yosemite, which I didn't notice on earlier versions. Basically if I suffer a connection issue with my ISP's mail service (which does sometimes become slow to respond during peak hours) then Mail seems to try alternative ports.\nThis would be fine, except that it eventually settles on port 143 with SSL disabled, at which point it refuses to connect (because it can't send my password securely), but it has now changed the account's port permanently to 143, meaning I have to change it back before I can use my e-mail account again.\nIs there a way to prevent Mail from doing this? I've set the correct port for the account, and know it's correct, so I don't want Mail to ever change it, but it keeps doing this any time the connection takes a bit too long to respond.\n\nA: Make sure you've switched off the new 'Automatically Maintain' settings that appeared with Yosemite.\nTwo places, outgoing & incoming...  \nfor each account\n\nand for each Outgoing Server\n\n", "Q: Automount afp Volume with AppleScript I know this is similar to other open questions about mounting network drives, but this one is slightly different. \nI have an AppleScript that runs at startup that looks like this:\ntell Application \"Finder\"\n  mount volume \"afp://192.168.1.105/file_server/user_name\nend tell\n\nWhere user_name is specific to the sub folder under file_server. On one of my Macs, this works and mounts the sub-folder at user-name. On a different mac, it only mounts the file_server folder. The one that doesn't mount the full path is OSX 10.9.5. The one that works properly is OSX 10.10.1. Makes me think it's an OSX version difference.\n\nA: You have a syntax error/incomplete instructions. Your server URI string is also missing the username.

Also if Steam games can run, how well does it run?  Do you think I would be better off getting Boot Camp?\n\nA: Parallels is great if you don't need full speed; it's not great for gaming, but it's OK at a push.\nI'd go with Boot Camp for gaming, Parallels for less-intensive work.  \nYou can use your Boot Camp drive in Parallels too, for times you just need quick access to Windows, without needing the full-speed setup. The only proviso is that you must shut it down in Parallels each time, rather than Suspend it, or it messes up the boot partition.\nYou can set your prefs in Parallels to do this automatically, so you don't forget.\nFrom comments…\nWindows needs to be purchased separately, for either solution, Boot Camp or Parallels.\nThis excerpt from Parallels FAQ  \n\nPre-Sales Questions - I want to buy Parallels and need to know…  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Does Windows come pre-installed with Parallels Desktop for Mac?  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Windows is not included with your purchase of Parallels Desktop 10 for Mac.

The problem is, when I disconnect and then reconnect the MacBook, I have to manually put the iMac in Target Display Mode using the keyboard.  This means I need to keep a keyboard attached to the iMac, and it clutters up my desk!\nIs there any way to switch the iMac into TDM without using the keyboard?  Maybe by logging in remotely?\nI found a few similar questions, but... no answers!\nIs it possible to have an iMac maintain target display mode even through sleep/screensaver\nTarget Display Mode: how to automate and persist on closing laptop\nAnyone?\n\nA: I found a way to do it with an old, white apple keyboard, haven't tested with others but it might work.\nI used a tool called Karabiner from https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/. When you install it, enable following options to get Command + F2 to work:\nF1..F12 to Functional Keys (Brightness Adjust, Music Control, etc)\n- F1,F2 to Brightness Adjust\n--- F1 to Brightness Down\n--- F2 to Brightness Up\n\nAfter enabling this option, hit Command + F2 having previously connected your macbook using thunderbolt cable. If you're lucky you'll have a new external display working!\n\nA: VirtualKVM will allow you to use your \"iMac as a monitor for [your] Macbook\". This is super easy and free. \n\nA: I was in that situation some time ago. The only way that seems to work without issuing the shortcut with Apple keyboard I found was this in Logitech forums.\n\nI have successfully implemented what I believe is a reasonable workaround. Here's what I did...\nPurchased and installed Keyboard Maestro from Stairways Software.\nWithin Keyboard Maestro I created a new Macro in the Global Macro Group.\nFor \"Triggered by any of the following:\" I selected \"This device key:\" and then hit the mute button (i.e. F10) on my Logitech keyboard. Keyboard Maestro correctly captured this as \"USB Receiver Mute\".\nFor \"Will execute the following actions:\" I had Keyboard Maestro record my keystrokes and then I hit ;⌘-F2 USING MY APPLE KEYBOARD. Keyboard Maestro captured this as ⌘-? (I'm sure the ? is just a place holder). It looks odd, but it works.\nNow when I hit the mute button (F10) I can enter AND EXIT Target Display Mode from my Logitech keyboard.\nI originally tried another key (F15), but that didn't work for me. It allowed me to enter, but not exit, Target Display Mode. I suspect that this is due to the fact that your Mac ignores most all of the keys on the keyboard when in Target Display Mode. However, I knew it still \"listened\" to the keys that control music playback. I selected mute as it was the least offensive to use. I haven't tried any others yet.\n\nBut, this method as the author says in his following post, have a really nasty disadvantage:\n\nTurns out the solution isn't perfect. After I took the batteries out of my Apple wireless keyboard, the mute/F10 trick on the Logitech keyboard stopped working. So, now I have the Apple wireless keyboard turned on, but not in use - the mute/F10 trick on the Logitech keyboard works again.\n\nSo, It's a pity, but the best method is to maintain and use the Apple keyboard.\n\nA: Just a followup in case anyone still has problems even with the previous instructions. To my knowledge, this only applies to Logitech keyboards, although it might apply to others that have software (i.e. Logitech Control Center) controlling the functionality of the Function keys.\nIn this case, the software controlling the keyboard overrules Karabiner - in Logitech Control Center (LCC) this can be \"fixed\" by going to the \"General\" tab of the LCC keyboard settings and check the first checkbox: \"When this box is checked, press F1, F2, etc. keys to use the standard function keys, and press and hold the Fn key to use the enhanced functions printed on the keys.\" \nAfter checking that box the function keys are annoying to use - as it says you have to press them in conjunction with the \"fn\" key. BUT target display mode works like a charm if you've enabled F1/F2 brightness controls in Karabiner! As I use it rarely, I just leave the box unchecked so that the keyboard is more user friendly and then check it when I want to use TDM!\nHope this is helpful!\n\nA: Generally, I'd add the possibility to control the imac via screen sharing.\n1. enable screen sharing on the imac\n2. reboot imac without mouse/keyboard, wait at login (or enable autologin)\n3. connect macbook via thunderbolt, start macbook, connect keyboard to mac (via usb or bluetooth)\n4. locate imac in macbooks finder, enable screen sharing\n5. press  ⌘ Cmd+f2 or fn+⌘ Cmd+f2 on your keyboard connected to your macbook\n6. voila!\nThat does not seem to work reliable enough. Or at all... but the first line stands true, if someone figures that F2 command out,  i'd still recommend screen sharing....!\n", "Q: Calendar.app fails to correctly display starting time of appointment when synced with google calendar Note the time difference in the screenshot of Calendar.app. \n\nThe appointment has been created directly on the google calendar webapp. It starts at 9.00 and ends at 10.00. \nAfter syncing with Calendar.app it shows up as you can see in the screenshot.\nThe detail information on the appointment is one hour too early.

Note that you still need a recovery email in your account, or a linked device, for this to work.\n\nA: My experience was quite frustrated but in the end I got my security questions reset!\nI am in China and I have not used my US-based apple id for a while but just my China-based apple id. So when I tried to login my US-based apple id for the first time in the past several months I was required to answer my security questions then iCloud replied the answers were wrong. I was pretty sure some answers were correct so I tried several times to let iCloud give me other questions but iCloud kept complaining some answers were wrong. After I tried 5 or 6 times they locked my account. When I tried to reset my question the server replied we can't verify your id to let you do that.\nI called apple China customer support and they told me there is little them can do too, I better not use this account any more. They also told me the reset procedure is the same whether I am in China or US, which means even if I called apple US customer support I probably get the same answer.\nAfter that I tried iCloud everyday (when they unlock my account) to see if it would let me reset my question. After I tried the 5th time and I didn't even expect it would let me do iCloud suddenly showed the reset page and let me reset it! I don't even know why they let me do it this time.\n", "Q: Correcting text on iOS: fixing capitalization I re-write and re-organize text frequently when I type longer messages (emails, StackExchange posts, etc). That means that words that were originally at the beginning of a sentence might end up in the middle, or vice versa.\nI have found that it is nearly impossible on an iOS device to change the capitalization of a word without retyping the entire word. If I try to highlight just the first letter (or to drag the highlight end-point), then it snaps back to highlighting the entire word.\nIs there some technique I am missing to do this? \nOr maybe some custom keyboard that would make this simple? (I haven't used any custom keyboards yet.)\nSome of this is in built-in apps (iMessage, Mail), others are in 3rd-party apps (\"Alien Blue\" client for Reddit, Facebook app).\nIn case it matters, I use an iPhone 6 and an iPad Air, both with latest iOS 8.1.3. \n\nA: iOS 12\nStarting with iOS 12, you can turn the software keyboard into a trackpad even on an iPhone that doesn’t feature 3D Touch.\nSimply press-and-hold the spacebar until the keyboard blanks out. Then slide your finger across the keyboard to move the cursor.\nThis trick also works on iPads.\nScreenshot courtesy of iMore:\n\niOS 9 (iPad Only)\nOn iPad only, iOS 9 originally trackpad mode for the iPad only. To activate it, simply press-and-hold two fingers on the keyboard until the keyboard blanks out.\nIn addition, you can also double-tap-and-hold on the keyboard with two fingers to select the current word, then drag the selection by sliding your fingers across the keyboard.\nScreenshot courtesy of iMore:\n\n3D Touch\nOf course, if you have an iPhone 6s or later you can achieve the same thing by 3D Touching anywhere on the keyboard. The advantage of 3D Touch is that once you’ve moved your cursor you can then press a little harder to select the entire word, then keep dragging your selection across more text.\nDo note that immediately after pressing a key on the software keyboard, you will need to wait for the cursor to blink once before you can activate trackpad mode with 3D Touch.\nOlder Devices / iOS Versions\nOn iPhones without 3D Touch running iOS 11 or earlier, and on iPads running iOS 8 or earlier, you needed to press-and-hold on the text to bring up the loupe, then drag the cursor to the exact desired position.\nAn alternative on 4.7” and 5.5” iPhones was to flip the iPhone into landscape orientation. Many (but indeed not all) applications then offered < and > keys that let you move the cursor left or right. You could then tap at the beginning of the word you want to edit, then move the cursor right and delete.\n", "Q: Keys are not repeating with Yosemite after 10.10.2 I never had a single issue with yosemite, until yestersday after updating to 10.10.2.\nNow I press a key and hold it and it is not repeating anymore.\nbut the problem is selective.

How to fix? Running OS X 10.10.2 on a Early 2009 Mac Pro. System installed on a 256 GB solid state drive. 10 GB of memory.\nI'm having a problem with Time Machine where it's not backing up some of my files and folders. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it, but it includes very, very important things like the parent directory for projects I'm working on, arbitrary hash directories in some git repositories, an assortment of emails, Messages attachments, random preferences files, and somehow the entire contents of my Pictures folder. And probably more -- I haven't checked everything.\nI've recently forced Time Machine to do a full traversal when it made a recent backup (and confirmed that it was a full traversal by looking at backupd's output in Console.app), but these files are still missing.\nI also tried going into one of the directories that wasn't being backed up and running:\nfind . -exec touch {} \\;\n\nto make every file appear to be recently modified, and then told Time Machine to make a new backup, but it still skipped them.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for what I can do to fix Time Machine? I just want it to do a full backup, not skipping anything.\nAs a last ditch effort I could blow away my Time Machine drive and start from scratch, but I really, really don't want to do that because it contains several months worth of backups, and I occasionally do need to go back and get older versions of files.\nEdit:\nI haven't found a solution to this particular issue, but I have decided to discontinue using Time Machine for backups as I can no longer rely on it. I've decided to give ChronoSync a try since it seems pretty comparable.\nEdit 2:\nWhile re-reading some of my old questions I decided I'd make another update because I've learned more about this issue since my previous edit. I discovered that the cause of my data not being backed up was a bug in Qt's development tools, as detailed here. The fault was not Time Machine's. Since posting this question I've been using Time Machine again with no issues, though I still occasionally use my check-time-machine script to make sure everything is in fact being backed up properly.\n\nA: I have the same issue since one of the mavericks updates, not necessarily the .0 version, not sure when exactly it started. I have this issue mostly with one folder: ~/Library/Preferences. I can fix the issue (see below), but 1-3 weeks later the issue is happening again with that folder. I think this folder might be hit often by the bug, cause the prefs-files in there are often changed, I dont know. Anway its a bug! If I should guess, the reason might be a bug in fsevents-daemon (fseventsd), which is responsible for tracking file system changes.\nSometimes I also have other folders than Preferences not backing up anymore, but this happens not that often.\nTo test which folders are \"stuck\" and do not backup properly you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*do a fresh backup and keep the backup volume connected\n\n*in Terminal: tmutil compare -n\nThe terminal command runs 30 mins with my backup of 150 GB size.\nIt helps identifying files which are not in the Latest backup. Be informed, some files might be shown, which are ok to be not backed up.\nI also tried touch files, which did not help. What helped, was renaming the parent folder. To fix the issue for a particular folder, e. g. ~/Library/Preferences, I rename the folder twice like:\nin Terminal:\nsudo mv ~/Library/Preferences ~/Library/PreferenceS\nsudo mv ~/Library/PreferenceS ~/Library/Preferences\n\nNote, the last letter s/S at the end. I need sudo for the Preferences folder, cause OSX has set special access rights for that folder. So sudo might not be needed for other folders. After doing so, the files in that folder are backed up correctly again. Problem: the issue is not solved permanently. Unpredictably after 1-3 weeks the issue is back.\nother links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine not detecting changes in certain folders\n\n*http://forums.macnn.com/90/mac-os-x/509489/potential-time-machine-issue-mavericks-leaving/\n\n*Some files are gone after recovery from Time Machine backup... WHY?\n\nA: Both I and my housemate ran into this problem on separate iMacs. It first cropped up around the time we upgraded to Mavericks. After battling it for weeks I can confirm that (a) messing with your preference files won't fix it and (b) starting over with a new Time Machine backup disk and clean preference files won't fix it. Time Machine may behave itself for a while but within one to four weeks it will start skipping files and folders at various levels, particularly in folders like ~/Library/Preferences that see a lot of change.\nI'm chiming in in hopes of saving others some frustration. Run tmutil compare -n immediately after a backup and see if anything critical is missing. If so switch to an alternative backup system as soon as possible. Numerous folks have posted about this over the years and no one has ever gotten Time Machine working again once this has cropped up.\nYou may run across this thread which details similar problems in Mountain Lion. At this point that thread contains a number of red herrings related to corrupted Time Machine preference files which don't seem to be relevant for Mavericks or Yosemite.\n\nA: I just recreated a Time Machine backup from a completely blank hard drive. I found that it was still skipping files, but after digging in more, I discovered that lots of my files (for reasons I can't fathom) were marked as being excluded from Time Machine. Specifically, the files were marked with sticky exclusion.\nI wrote a script to scan my entire filesystems for things that are being excluded from Time Machine and report back, differentiating between which files are meant to be included but aren't and which files are meant to be excluded. It can then optionally remove the exclusion marker from all of the excluded files it finds. Once I did this, all of my data was backed up properly.\nI am now running OS X 10.11.1, so I'm not sure if the files that were missing from when I originally made this thread were due to being excluded (though I can confirm at least a few of them were), or if there were bugs in Time Machine that's been fixed in the subsequent OS updates, or if clearing out my Time Machine backup and starting completely fresh fixed it.

How is vm.memory_pressure's value bounded / calculated on OS X 10.10.2 - Yosemite?\nI've researched several answers to this question and am trying a few things on the command line to get exact values rather than looking at the graphs in Activity Monitor.\nWith the system under light load:\n~ ❯❯❯ sysctl -a vm | grep page_free && sysctl vm.memory_pressure && sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level\nvm.vm_page_free_target: 4000\nvm.page_free_wanted: 0\nvm.page_free_count: 2683717\nvm.memory_pressure: 0\nkern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level: 1\n\nThe kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level looks right, and appears to be what it uses to color the graph (green for 1-NORMAL, yellow for 2-WARN, red for 4-CRITICAL). However, vm.memory_pressure is 0 and the graph has some amount of green to it, and it's jagged, meaning the value is clearly changing over time, not just sitting at 0.\nUnder heavy load it looks like this:\n❯❯❯ sysctl -a vm | grep page_free && sysctl vm.memory_pressure && sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level\nvm.vm_page_free_target: 4000\nvm.page_free_wanted: 0\nvm.page_free_count: 32572\nvm.memory_pressure: 1693\nkern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level: 4\n\nOr this...\n~ ❯❯❯ sysctl -a vm | grep page_free && sysctl vm.memory_pressure && sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level\nvm.vm_page_free_target: 4000\nvm.page_free_wanted: 0\nvm.page_free_count: 5431\nvm.memory_pressure: 277\nkern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level: 4\n\nOr this...\n~ ❯❯❯ sysctl -a vm | grep page_free && sysctl vm.memory_pressure && sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level\nvm.vm_page_free_target: 4000\nvm.page_free_wanted: 3220\nvm.page_free_count: 805\nvm.memory_pressure: 1\nkern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level: 4\n\nHere's where I'm confused. None of these values alone could possibly be the Y value of the graph for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, vm.memory_pressure just sits at 0 almost all the time under normal load, and the graph doesn't sit at 0.\nSecond, they are not consistent with one another. Looking at the memory_pressure value, it is lower when it actually had wanted pages (3220 wanted and pressure of only 1) than when it had 5431 free and none wanted (pressure was 277). And somehow that's even lower pressure than when it had 32572 free (and had 1693 pressure).\nSo, when it plots that graph, what's the calculation for the Y value, and how can I get the data I need to calculate it from the command line? I'm looking to make a command line tool that will spit out a percentage of how high the current line would be on that graph, so I need to know how to calculate the value at any given time, as well as what the range of possible values are.\n\nA: This is currently only a partial answer. This answer not complete until this sentence removed.\nThe thing about this question is that on the face of it, the Memory Pressure graph doesn't quite make sense when comparing it with what's reported in Terminal when using the command outlined by the OP:\nsysctl -a vm | grep page_free && sysctl vm.memory_pressure && sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level\n\nHowever, the problem here is that this command limits the vm values it's reporting back. In fact, there's actually 105 values in total but this command only reports the following five values:\nvm.vm_page_free_target:\nvm.page_free_wanted:\nvm.page_free_count:\nvm.memory_pressure:\nkern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level:\n\nNOTE: Numerical values would normally appear after the colon (:), however I have not included these.\nObviously, the overwhelming majority of the 105 vm values are not part of the actual calculation that determines memory pressure, but the problem here is that the five values above are not the only ones used to calculate memory pressure. \nFor example, while the above output provides some of the various free values, it's not providing any of the inactive values, etc. \nThese values are important because the memory pressure algorithm calculates a ratio between those values, and the relationship between those values isn't apparent from the output produced by the command in the OP's question.\nI think I may have some technical information that can shed more light on this. I will update this answer either way within the week.\n[STATUS UPDATE]\nI've been unable to find the technical information I was looking for. However, I am fairly certain I do still have it - probably on some old CDR/DVDR backups.

Even the charger won't recognize that it is plugged in. This Mac is less than two years old, the battery should be fine.\n\nA: There is a circuit board on the battery itself that reports its presence and status to the OS X.\nIn OS X, there is a piece of hardware run by firmware called System Management Controller (SMC) that takes that information and processes it. Sometimes, the SMC gets confused and needs to be reset following instructions from Apple.\nYou can also look up your Battery information in the About This Mac, to see what it says.\nWhat could cause the display of the X?\nThe circuit mounted on the battery itself could have malfunctioned. Normally, it will reserve a minimum charge for itself and not allow the battery to drain beyond that point. But, if the battery was drained to the levels that the built-in circuit can no longer function, it will not report the status and ask to be charged. If you were installing Yosemite, you should have gotten a warning that you are on battery. If ignored, the battery could have been drained completely. \nSo what can you do other than SMC reset or bringing it in for repair? You can try the coconut app to see if it does something. https://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/\n\nA: The hardware that reads the battery health is independent of the OS running so it's just a coincidence that the X appeared with the update. I would get on the phone with AppleCare (or on the web or in a store) and see if they can run some remote diagnostics and tell you what precisely is happening with the battery.\nYou can also get many details from System Information:\n\nHowever, these snapshot values aren't as good as the tools and manufacturing data that Apple has on specific batteries, models and usage patterns. Basically, once you have the X - the battery will need to be replaced sooner rather than later whether it's two months old or two years old.\n\nA: Ok, so I found out how to fix the battery. You need to power off the computer, hold Shift+Control+Option+Power (at the same time) for a couple of seconds, then turn the computer back on.

I finally just removed it, but wondered as to how to get it to stop? I even turned off location tracking and yet it continued. \nI wonder if having the older version still on my phone might have caused this?\n\nA: It may be because you added as a passbook pass.

The constant barrage of dialogs is incredibly irritating - I understand that removing the file from iCloud Drive will result in the file being removed from all of my iCloud Devices.\nThere is no Finder preference that I could find, and a Google search has not yielded anything.\n\nA: It has not been implemented yet (as of version 10.11.2), so no. I submitted a feedback request, but the more people request it, the more likely it will be added in further versions of OS X. To request it, go to : http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: As of macOS 10.12 Sierra, this is possible through Finder's preferences:\n\nShow warning before removing from iCloud Drive\n\n\n", "Q: tmux hangs when re-attaching session after logout Since Yosemite, my tmux, which I installed via MacPorts, \"hangs\" when I re-attach it after my user has logged out and logged in again. I.e. it cannot start new processes, like a new command line. The logs in console do not show anything. \nI do not even know how I start to figure out what's happening here.\n\nA: I think the use of __DARWIN_VERS_1050 in the tmux Portfile may be causing this.\nIf you are able, try a clean compile from source (i.e. without that CPPFLAGS addition). Be sure to completely restart your tmux server using your fresh-built binary (the difference happens in the daemon(3) call made when the server first starts up—so using a “clean” binary to connect to a server started with the MacPorts-built binary would not help).\n\nTangentially, since you use tmux on OS X, you might also use my reattach-to-user-namespace wrapper program. It seems like the wrapper program may not actually be necessary on Yosemite for pasteboard access inside tmux. If you are using the wrapper (and you do not mind testing a bit), try removing it from your configuration on your Yosemite system. I would appreciate hearing whether things (continue) to work without use of the wrapper (or whether you still lose pasteboard access at some point).\n", "Q: Resetting printing password I use a printer on a Windows server configured as\nsmb://server.domain/printer\n\nas it requires authentication after the first use I had to give my credentials which where then stored in the key chain.\nSo far so good.\nI then had to change my password on the server side.

My iPad game center app shows friend recommendations. That list includes people that I do not know, people I have heard of but have never had direct contact, as well as people whom I regularly communicate with but never via Apple products. It is freaky. What information is friend recommendation based on?\n\nA: It's friends of your friends and people who have some of the same games installed as you.\n\nA: From the settings, I think it's giving you recommendations based on you Contacts and Facebook.\nAs shown in the picture:\n\nPicture comes from here:\nhttp://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iosapps/how-use-game-centre-on-ios-3542729/\n", "Q: AddPrinter.app hangs on Yosemite I want to add a network printer on my MBP13R mid-2013.

Then I close the lid (MBA goes to sleep) and go to different place with different wifi network. When I change the wifi network (eq when I go to nearby coffee shop) something strange happens: from that point I can not reach most of the internet.

I want to delete the photos imported as a test but when I select them in My Photos the option to delete them (the dustbin) does not light up as an option. How can I delete them? Any help appreciated.\n\nA: Go on iTunes and uncheck the albums you have imported. Just do the reverse of what you did to import photos...\n", "Q: When does it help to restore an iDevice using iTunes, as opposed to \"erase all content and settings\"? There are two ways to factory reset an iDevice:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the iDevice, open Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. (Reference)\n\n*Plug in the device to a computer, open iTunes, and click the Reset button. (Reference)\n\n\nOne difference between these two is that (2) causes iTunes to download and install a fresh copy of iOS. Obviously, you'd use this technique when your iOS installation is so messed up that it doesn't even boot.\nWhat are the other situations in which there's a difference between these two techniques for performing a factory reset?\nConcretely, my iPhone suffers from poor battery life. I've exhausted all the other options I can think of, and I'm about to do a factory reset. Is it better I do it using iTunes in case my iOS installation is corrupt in some way?\nI don't want to be in a situation where I do a factory reset on-device (technique (1) above), find that it still doesn't solve the issue, and then have to (2) anyway. If there's a chance of that happening, I'd rather go straight away to (2). Thanks.\n\nA: Erase all content and settings does exactly that, it erases user data and restores default settings - but leaves the current version of iOS intact.\nPerforming a full restore through iTunes is the only way to completely erase the device and perform a fresh installation of iOS.\nIf you've any doubts then the iTunes restore is probably your best option as it will update your version of iOS, with the option of backing up and subsequently restoring your apps, music and other settings with the minimum of effort.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S wth update 8.1.3 I updated my iPhone with the iOS update 8.1.3, and now I am unable to activate my phone because it shows a connect to iTunes screen with no other option.  \nFinally, when I connect to iTunes, it gives me a message to update or, if it is still not working, completely restore to factory settings.  \nAlthough there was no warning that this update is not suitable to my iPhone, now I have no other option than restoring my iPhone to factory settings. Worse, the update fails with error -39\nQuestion: How do I fix my iPhone since it will not start up at all and this error -39 doesn't help me know what's really wrong and if it's my iPhone or my Computer that needs fixing?\n\nA: Try to put your device in DFU mode, then restore it via iTunes. This method should work with you.\n", "Q: iTunes 12.1 - Stuttering when playing music I've just upgraded to the latest version of iTunes (12.1) for Windows -- the first proper 64-bit edition of the software for Windows -- and now all my music has stutters, pops and clicks when playing music.\nI have an extremely well-specced machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i7 \n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 \n\n*16GB RAM \n\n*Windows 8.1 64-bit\n\n\nLatest drivers. I even ensured I reset my machine after the installation. It happens with all music files, from MP3 to AAC. \nWhat's going on? Every other music player on my system plays the same files perfectly fine.\n\nA: Many iTunes for Windows users had the same problem with the recent upgrade, myself included. To fix the problem (it worked for me), download and install the iTunes 12.1 for Windows that is supposed to be for older video cards. But don't let that last part fool you. I have a card less than 12 months old and this solution worked wonderfully. Here is the link to the download from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1784?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US.\n\nA: Apple have released an update to iTunes that fixes this problem. \niTunes 12.1.1 (and higher) should solve any issues you're having (it did for me).\n", "Q: Macbook pro - mid 2012 screen going black My screen keeps going black as if it is going to sleep but will then not wake up, no matter how many various key combinations i retry.\nI get the following stack trace upon restart which makes it look like there is potentially something wrong with the video card driver?

Your GPU is faulty. Good news? Apple launched a repair program to fix MacBook Pro machines sold between February 2011 and February 2013 that have problems with distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts.\n(taken from macrumors.com)\n\nA: Does this happen when you're using the integrated graphics (when running solely on battery power)?\nMy advice would be to perform an SMC reset then see what happens. If the problem persists get hold of a USB hard disk and install a clean copy of OS X on it, then see if you get exactly the same issue when the system goes to sleep.\nIf you do have the same problem it will point to a hardware issue, possibly a GPU re-ball/re-flow (a pain but ultimately a lot cheaper than buying a new or even secondhand MacBook).\nAnd, if you don't have any problems, you can simply back up using Time Machine, erase your drive and reinstall - at a cost of nothing except time taken.\n", "Q: Changing default email color in Mail.app does not take effect I have parametered  my Mail (Mac) so that the font color of all my emails are Green, yet each time I write an email, I must change the color myself.   Why didn't it take?  Which box should I have/not check(ed)?\n\nA: Apple doesn't yet offer the feature you want.  There are various workarounds like reusing a draft where you have set the color you want, creating custom stationery, composing your message as part of a sig set to your desired color, etc.\n", "Q: Yosemite: how to save PDF cropped by Preview I use Preview to crop a PDF file but it says that the content outside the selection will not be deleted, i.e. they are just hidden, and when printing there do appear.\nHow to save the cropped PDF?\nThank you in advance for any suggestions.\n\nA: My impression is that it's not straightforwardly possible, unless you delete all other pages (which can be done quickly with the miniature view) and then saving. You can then revert everything back. You could also crop the one page, and then print it to pdf with ⌘-P. Just select PDF > Save as Pdf and select only the one page you cropped.\n", "Q: Cannot seem to add internal testers with existing iTunes Connect accounts I am trying to add internal beta testers to my app. The app is still in development, so I do not wish to submit the app for review for external testers. It seems the only way I can add an internal tester is if I add them as a new iTunes Connect User. When I try to though, I cannot because the Apple ID (email) of the person I want to invite already has an iTunes Connect account. Is there any way I can add people who already have Connect accounts as internal testers?\n\nA: You can use a \"+\" sign to add the same email to your desired iTunes Connect Account.\nIf the email is someone@gmail.com, you can add it like this: someone+0@gmail.com\nThe system ignores the \"+\" sign and any character after that, it works like a charm but you have to use the altered email for the login.\n\nA: After emailing Apple Support about this, I received an email saying this:\n\nIf a person's Apple ID is already associated with another iTunes\n  Connect organization, the user needs to provide a distinct email\n  address that can be associated with the new organization; iTunes\n  Connect creates an additional Apple ID for the user.\n\nI think it seems odd that Apple would require someone with an existing IC account to create another one just to be an admin on another user's organization, but this did work for me.\nI used another one of my emails and created a new Apple ID when adding myself as another admin into the group. When I finally received a beta tester invite through that email, I was also able to install and use the app through my previous Apple ID.\n\nA: I have faced the same problem like Leo.

I guess it depends on the users, whether they want to express their feelings or not. Is it any statistics when I can get the first review?\n\nA: This depends entirely on the app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some apps promote reviewing and get more reviews.\n\n*Some apps are designed for kids and do not get as many reviews, but sometimes get more reviews due to parents reviewing the app.\n\n*Some apps' market demographics means that the users are unlikely to review an app.\n\n\nThere's no single average time frame.

I've seen a couple of questions on the exchange that are similar to the issues I am having. But I haven't been able to get things to work referencing those issues. \nI am ultimately looking to install Linux Mint or Ubuntu as a dual boot on my Macbook Pro (2011) which is running Mountain Lion. This is taking some trial and error. \nI partitioned my HD into to equal segments about 250 GB each, one for Mountain Lion and one for Linux Mint. The partitioned segment was \"free space\" originally. I also installed rEFInd boot manager to manage to dual boot. \nThere were errors with my Mint install. The installation did not complete, but the \"free space\" was formatted during the install process. \nI was worried that if I tried doing the install again, I wouldn't be able to re-format the newly formatted \"free-space\" the partitions I made for the Mint install. So I removed all my partitions except the HD and recovery. (At least I think they are removed -- i.e. they no longer show up in the partition layout).\nWhat I am left with are two partitions:\n\nThe problem is I can't resize the Macintosh HD partition. I still should have 500Gb available. I'd like to just go back to a single partition.\nSomething else, probably related is that this Recovery Hd is taking up 650Mb (see below). Which is not a problem but I don't recall it being there originally when I started setting this up earlier today. \n \nHow do I override whatever is locked here and not allowing me to restore full size to the HD partition?\nTheres got to be an easy way to do this. \nI've been slamming my head on the wall trying to figure this out. Unfortunately my backup drive got corrupted somehow. So I'm stuck either taking it to an apple store or figuring out how to resize the partition.\nAs an update:\nThanks to @Buscar웃 I have run the terminal command \"defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\". This turns on Debug option for the Disk utility. What I see is the following:\n\nI now see two recovery drives and \"disk0s1\"(what is this??). I need to delete the recovery drive that remains when I turn off the show all partitions from debug feature. \nWhat is the easiest way to delete this recovery partition?\nThus far I've come across this link to delete a partition. \nFor completeness when I run \"diskutil list\" I get: \n\nWhat is this \"disk0s1/EFI\"? (Something left over from an installation attempt?)\nDo I need to delete \"disk0s1/EFI\"? and the extra Recovery HD?\nHow do I do this?\nAgain this is all in the hope of having a single partition completely filled with the Macintosh HD. \nProblem solved:\nI erased the Recovery HD. Then went back to the main disk, went to partition and was able to remove the recovery partition. \nThen I could expand my Mac HD! \n\nStill what is this \"disk0s1\"?\n\nA: The Recovery Partition is created during OS X installation.\nNormally that partition is hidden unless you are using the Debug mode in Disk Utility to show all partitions.\nIn other words, it should not be showing in your system as it is.\nTurn off the show all partitions (in Debug menu), and check.\nIf it is still there back it up (for safety) then delete it.\nJust in case you delete the original Recovery partition, you can get it back using the Internet recovery, or from reinstalling the OS X.\nThe way it should look like (notice the EFI and Recovery are grayed out but still showing on the side, since I have the Debug show all partition ON).\n\n", "Q: Tasks needing admin password (Finder, Installer) hang with beachball for minutes Taks needing and admin password, like deleting certain files in the Finder or running an application installer, hang for minutes with a beachball. After a couple of minutes the dialog asking for an admin password appears finally. \nOnce the window finally appears it also takes a minute to be usable. After I entered the password everything works just fine.\nThe same also happens when trying to mount a disk image with a password. It takes minutes for the password window to show up.\nI can't see anything happen in Activity Monitor. CPU usage is low and RAM is plentiful.

It's been a long saga getting to the point where I am comfortable that my new Macbook Pro has FileVault 2 enabled properly on Yosemite.\nI ran into the \"Encryption paused - connect power adapter\" problem several times. Had to do a hard-disk erase and full re-install twice, and spent hours online with Apple support.\nEventually, encryption completed and it told me \"A recovery key has been set\" ... but never told me what the key was!\nToday, I disabled encryption, rebooted, and re-enabled encryption - with the same result.\nEventually, I used fdesetup changerecovery --personal to create a new recovery key, which I was able to validate with fdesetup validaterecovery.\nI now have that key stored in a very safe place (nowhere near my MBP).\nBut I originally requested, via the GUI, that the key also be stored in iCloud. Now I suspect that the key they have is not the key which will work to decrypt my drive at last resort.\nI've spent hours googling, and browsing Apple's support pages, but nowhere can I find out how to update the recovery key stored in my iCloud account.\nAny advice greatly appreciated\n\nA: According to Apple's [documentation on Filevault 2] (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790) (emphasis added by me)\n\nChanging your recovery key\nIn the Security & Privacy system preference, under the FileVault tab, click \"Turn Off FileVault\" to disable FileVault. After FileVault is off, FileVault will begin to decrypt your drive. Once decryption is complete, you can click the \"Turn On FileVault\" button. Doing this allows you to enable unlock-capable users. You're also provided with a new recovery key and have the option of sending this new key to Apple. The old key sent to Apple will not be able to unlock your newly-encrypted disk. If you need to retrieve your recovery key from Apple, only the new one will be retrieved based on the Serial Number and Record Number displayed in the login window.\n\nI think that this might be your answer.\n\nA: I don't know how to solve the iCloud issue, but I'd recommend instead that you use an excellent encryption tool like GPG or TrueCrypt (7.1a only!!) to encrypt a text file that has your FileVault Recovery Key and then you can upload that file to iCloud file storage or any Cloud service you like -- then it's super secure AND you don't have to jump through Apple verification steps or talk to support.\n\nA: If you choose to \"Create a recovery key and do not use my icloud account\" it means that the key stored in icloud can no longer decrypt your disk. Only the key you made (and wrote down, took a screenshot of, or took a picture of with your camera), will allow you to decrypt. If you chose to store the key with apple as well then you would get prompted to answer three security questions which you would need to be able to answer to decrypt your disk.\nDid you get those prompts? If not, you are the sole holder of a decryption key.\n", "Q: My mac is rebooting everytime I login I have downloaded these apps to conveniently shutdown or restart my MAC from spotlight. Usually I used the shutdown app which worked great. Today I used the restart app. Since then my MAC is restarting gives me the login screen, I type the password, the desktop starts to show, and before it finishes loading, boom, another restart.\nI noticed that when logging in, the preview app is opened again (it was open when I ran the restart command), so one idea I have, is that somehow the OS is relaunching the restart app, causing a new restart. Yet I'm not sure, could be totally bug from Apple, or anything else.\n\n\n*\n\n*I did use the restart app in the past a few times without a problem.\n\n*The same problem was about two weeks ago, but only one restart happened, then the computer worked fine. I'm not sure, but I think that then I did not use the restart app. But I'm very vague with my memory on this one, because it was only one restart, so I didn't think there is a problem.\n\n\nI tried, while being on the login screen, to not type the password but press the restart and shutdown buttons at the bottom. Also tried leaving the computer not connected to the electricity for about 3 hours.

Then I restarted and made sure the little checkbox next to '' is empty (probably this made the effect). When the computer started I could log in, but it is still weird, the desktop background image disappears and comes back, no dock, ... see my followup question.\nThe next time I logged in I moved all the apps to the trash, just in case.\n\nA: It is not your Apple OS X responsible but the app you downloaded.\nQuick look in to the code shows that it will restart if error is reported without proper classification of the error. \nOS X has those as well, but most are ignored and it will continue to load.\nHere is some material on that topic:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1134/_index.html\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/4505664\nand apparently working one here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/6105338\nAs @Tetsujin pointed out, shut down and boot from external drive then remove that app.\nOr even better use what @ Mr Rabbit is recommending.\n", "Q: \"DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed\" error dialog when re-opening Google Drive after re-installation I recently ran into this problem when doing desktop support for a user, and wanted to share the solution.

I have recently read the article Should you leave your smartphone plugged into the charger overnight?\nThe article listed the following points:\n\nYou can leave your phone plugged into the charger overnight without\n  too much risk, provided it’s not a counterfeit charger, and you don’t\n  let your phone overheat. For best results with your smartphone\n  charging, here’s what to remember:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Always use official chargers and cables, or certified alternatives from reputable brands and retailers.\n  \n*Don’t let your phone get too hot. Remove the case when charging overnight.\n  \n*For the longest battery life possible, try to keep your battery between 50 and 80 percent.\n  \n*Avoid letting phone battery completely discharge, and don’t charge it from 0 percent up to 100 percent too often.\n  \n\n\nIs this actually the optimum way of charging iPhones, iPads, MacBooks ?\n\nA: That article is focusing on the possible dangers of starting a fire if not original components are used.\nNow you can ignore it and continue using non apple hardware at your own risk (usually small but it can happen), or use OEM hardware that is designed to prevent overheating (over-current) and it will shut down before serious stuff occurs.\nDefinitely do not put it under your pillow while charging or in any case allowing it to radiate the heat generated.\nThe points 2, 3, and 4 are correct.\n\nA: I think it's always best to go straight to the source: http://www.apple.com/batteries/\nThere are a lot of myths that come with batteries.

I assume that once I download a new OS, that it will appear in place of the 10.6.8 when I click on the Apple icon at the top left side of my screen and ten click on about this mac. How can I download Yosemite? \n\nA: Check your iMac model and the date.\nIn About this Mac (here is mine)\n\nYosemite requires iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)\nLog in App Store and get it from there. The download process can take very long time, a hour or more (it is > 5 Gig file), depending on your Internet speed.\nOnce it is done, find the file called \"Install OS X Yosemite.app\" and click on it.\nIf Yosemite does not work for you then get the 10.7.5 (minimum required) for TurboTax 2014.\n\nA: You can download the Yosemite OS X  from the App Store.

Most of it went smoothly however as the Open Directory Host Name was changed things got a bit funny. \nUser mappings were all different so I unbound from the old OD/rebound to the new OD, chown-ed the home folder to the new user and deleted the old certificates from the keychain. It seems to have worked but the only problem is that user profiles aren't doing what they're supposed to. I've added in some mail accounts to a user profile and, if that user logs in to a machine that they previously have, no mail accounts are being created. If the user logs into a machine they have never logged into before - the accounts create automatically via the user profile.\nI know there must be something I'm missing here as deleting the user's home directory and logging in fresh doesn't work (the profiles are pulled from the server but the mail accounts aren't added). Is there some other place that OS X stores user account information or previously logged in users (like mobile users or similar)?\nIn short I've effectively switched binding Open Directory, trying to keep the home directory. Strangely settings like Dock/Finder being configured via the profile manager are read and accepted by the user's machine so it seems to be just mail (so far) that's not working.\n\nA: Okay I've managed a solution. Note this only works if the open directory hasn't been corrupted like ours was, you'll need to chown the home directory again after a rebind.

Disk Utility can't repair this disk.\" What now? When I turned my computer on, it got stuck on a gray screen (nothing, no apple logo, but occasionally a spinning wheel, and I could move the mouse). I rebooted in recovery mode and got the various messages when I tried to repare using disc utility: \"incorrect block count for file 0.indexDirectory (it should be 1508 instead of 754)\" then \"the volume Macintosh HD could not be verified completely.\" Then the alert that this disk could not be repaired.\nAre there any steps I can take now? I have a couple of external hard drives so if nothing else, do you know how I can back up files from my computer? I don't have time machine or anything like that set up. I'm not very skilled with computers so anything will help, even if it's just \"go see a professional.\" I have school assignments saved onto my hard drive so I'm really hoping I can salvage them. \n\nA: With some minor skills and lots of luck you can try to repair it.\nWhile holding the Command-S restart.\nWhen it is done (if it boots) type \"fsck -fy\".\nThis will try to repair your disk.\nYou could spend $120 and get the more professional tool called DiskWarrior.\nIn any and all cases, back up your stuff.\n", "Q: Transfer songs from ipod nano without password I have an old ipod with a lot of songs my son loaded years ago.

I've a laptop with triple boot, Yosemite, Windows 8.1, CentOS 7, and need a partition for sharing files between the 3 os's, i've been using exFAT, as it is supported by OSX & Windows but had some issues with linux and after try to mount it on linux, osx didn't recognize it, and i was unable to mount it, then just windows recognized it and after 1 day of using it got corrupted, i had to get my data back with TesDrive.\nNow i'm looking for the most accepted file sys to share files between them, so far i've found these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*NTFS: Using MacFUSE & NTFS-3G to enable read/write access,  or Paragon NTFS, but i've heard some bad things about stability & speed of those options... i would not like to lose my data.\n\n*HFS+: Using MacDrive Pro in windows to have read/write access to mac partition, i guess there's a way to allow linux support for hfs+. Heard some good & bad things about MacDrive but still not so sure...\n\n*exFAT: This way is the way i've already tried, bad experience with it, but most of the people seems to approve this option. Maybe i did something wrogn, BUT still the data loss is a problem...\n\n*FAT32: Limited drive size. Limited permission settings. Not the one i would like to pick.\nNeeds hierarchically ordered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stability (No data loss)\n\n*Great File Size support\n\n*Journaling\n\n*Speed\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1:\nAfter more research i've found Tuxera NTFS for mac, seems to be nice, but... how good is it in real life? does it offer real NTFS full support as it says?, great Stability? Speed? Journaling?\nIs it worth for the price?  \n\nA: Your first First choice would be to use cloud storage like dropbox if money is not an object and based on your hierarchically ordered needs:\n1-Stability (No data loss)\n2-Great File Size support\n3-Journaling\n4-Speed\nUpdate: Or you could attach a network attached storage(NAS) to your local network similar to cloud yourself.\nNAS systems are networked appliances which contain one or more hard drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID. \nNAS devices began gaining popularity as a convenient method of sharing files among multiple computers. Potential benefits of dedicated network-attached storage, compared to general-purpose servers also serving files, include faster data access, easier administration, and simple configuration. \nThey typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB/CIFS, or AFP.\nYour next would be FAT32, it is the only one that supports all the 3 OS's and also ps3 and xbox without any other utilities. You need to find a way for larger files than 4 gigs you might have.\nAnd your last choice would be exFAT.\nUPDATE 2:\n Or you can use a WD network hd connected directly to your computer's ethernet port and access it from all the 3 OS's:\nThe Western Digital units mentioned below use a proprietary file system and cannot be reformatted as FAT32, NTFS, or a Mac File System.\nThe file system on WD My Book Live, WD My Book Live Duo, WD ShareSpace, WD ShareSpace, WD My Book World Edition hard drives support access from Windows, Mac and most Linux based computer systems through a SAMBA network sharing connection.\n\nA: Better you don't go for ExFAT. It caused corruption in my HDD. Transfer speeds are not great though, I got around 30-50MBps max write speed but on the same drive, formatting it to NTFS, I get around 150 MBps write speed from my External HDD on Mac And Windows as well. For Mac I use Paragon for NTFS. So far, the best software and cheaper than Tuxera.\n\nA: I've done this kind of thing for years and can probably help you avoid the same pains I went through.\nCloud storage would be ideal for some use-cases, but sketchy on privacy/security without additional work, and not necessarily suitable for use cases involving a large amount of data. (I've worked around security/privacy issues with transparent per-file encryption, and use this in parallel with the solution I've outlined below, for different use cases.)\nHere are the local storage solutions in increasing order of viability (which is inherently subjective and dependent on specific use cases):\n\n\n*\n\n*exFAT: At the bottom only because of my own lack of experience with it, and its relative newness. There are compatibility problems between the platforms because of different block sizes. Apparently, formatting the drive in Windows with a block size smaller than 1024 bytes might work.\n\n*NTFS: I've had all kinds of problems with NTFS-3G, going back and forth between Windows, Mac, and Linux. File corruption, lost data, etc. This was a few years ago, maybe it's better now - but it was \"sold\" as solid then and it wasn't.\n\n*FAT32: In my experience, this is the only truly \"cross-platform\" file system that can bridge Mac, Linux, and Windows. (And cameras, and TVs, and...) There is a per-file 4GB size limit and 2TiB total volume size limit. You can in theory overcome the 32GB FAT32 limitation, with Fat32Formatter, but I don't know how compatible it is across systems. In theory, FAT+ allows for 256GiB files and using a higher block size\n\n*A virtual machine sharing its native filesystem to the host OS via CIFS: This is hands-down the best solution for most of my use cases.\n\n\nYears ago when I got fed up with the data corruption using NTFS-3G, I started using a small VM running Windows 2000, and shared an NTFS volume \"natively\" to the host OS via CIFS. Performance can't compare to directly attached storage, but I finally got to say goodbye to data corruption and the distrust and headaches it caused. NTFS formatted from Windows 2000, worked flawlessly and interchangeably with more modern versions of Windows, including switching back and forth between Windows 2000 in a VM, and Windows Vista (at the time).\nBut still, NTFS just wasn't robust enough for reliably storing massive amounts of data over long periods of time, even if in a mirrored configuration (and especially in a RAID5 configuration). Mainly due to bitrot and lack of checksumming. Granted, it was the best thing around for a long time, but not any more.\nNow, the only \"cross-platform\" file system I use is ZFS, presented via CIFS by Linux running in a VM. (I'm also increasingly using BTRFS which recently seems to have crossed some threshold of stability for my use cases. For a long time I only used it experimentally and it often let me down.)\nI don't use ZFS for Mac OS, only ZFS on Linux. (I used to use an OpenSolaris VM to host ZFS for the sake of purity and support for the most up-to-date ZFS features, until Oracle messed it up.)\nI tried ZFS for Mac a while back and it was too unstable and outdated. Maybe it's fine now, but my VM solution is flawless. And like I said, I'm increasingly using BTRFS anyway, which is a better match in many ways for my requirements (the first and foremost of which is rock-solid reliability - which ZFS has always provided).\nI triple-boot my Macs, and when I'm not running Linux natively, I run the same native Linux installation in a VM. Linux is perfectly happy alternating between running in a VM with guest additions, and natively. I'm almost always running a Linux VM for \"native\" ZFS or BTRFS volume access via CIFS, when not running it natively.\nI've seamlessly adjusted most of my workflows to accommodate the slower CIFS access to large \"cross-platform\" reliable storage. For example, if I need fast access to lots of working data, it's usually in an application that is unique to that particular host OS, and it doesn't need to be accessible across platforms. So I just use whatever fast local SSD storage the OS is available natively, and make regular copies to the slower \"cross-platform\" storage - or only when the project is done, depending on the specific use case.\nTip: If you do go the VM route, you'll be tempted to share the VM file system via a bridged adapter. The advantage to that is that the VM will have its own IP address on the same subnet, and the storage will be accessible even by other computers on that subnet. However, the drawbacks to a bridged adapter are 1) It is tied to a specific physical adapter and if you switch from, say, wired to wireless, you may lose internet connectivity from within the VM [which is only a problem if you are also using the VM as your productivity OS, as I usually do]. And 2) Bridged adapters can be finicky. Sometimes it \"just works\", but if you have problems, troubleshooting can be pretty messy. A better solution is to configure the VM with two adapters: A) NAT [for internet access from the VM which will work no matter what physical adapter is providing it], and B) Host-only, configured with a static IP address, no DNS or gateway, virtio adapter, and with promiscuous mode. Only your local machine will be able to access the VM's CIFS shares. It's not trivial to get this solution set up, but once you do it's basically magic.\nGood luck!\n\nA: ExFAT is your way.\nHaven't the 4/32GB limited!\nI also using this format on my 120GB USB 2.0 HDD very long. It work very well for me at least.\n\nA: Years ago I had problems with FAT32, so I switched to NTFS. I had an external HD back in the day and one day the cable connection was interrupted by accident and I lost most of my files. So I switched to HFS+ with MacDrive. Same problem with the cable but I managed to restore everything.\nAfter a while there was rumour that Apple was going to support ZFS and indeed there was a driver in one of the Snow Leopard Server editions, but Apple quickly dismissed the idea and a bunch of developers made an open-source ZFS driver for Mac. I still have discs in ZFS. They are reliable, but external discs on Mac are unstable. I can't, for example, eject the disc twice, so I'm forced to shut down the machine. Then there is the problem of the frequent OS updates from Apple and the pain to reinstall the drivers.\nBecause of that, I'd stick to HFS+. As a drawback you have to spend a bunch of money on MacDrive, but it's easier to maintain and safer. I never noticed any speed issues.\n", "Q: Can I clear my iPhone camera roll without losing any photo? It seems to me that all photos taken with the iPhone go into:\n\n\n*\n\n*the iPhone Camera Roll\n\n*the iCloud photo stream\n\n*iPhoto/Aperture projects (e.g. \"Photo stream for Decembre 2014\")\n\n\nCan I clear completely my iPhone's camera roll without losing any photo?\nI.e. will the duplicates in the iCloud stream and in iPhoto/Aperture projects will be deleted or not?\nMy goal is to free some space on the iPhone while, of course, not losing anything.\nEdit: when I say iPhoto/Aperture projects I mean that there are projects automatically created in Aperture for every month and my iPhone's photo are automatically added to it. I don't know how/why it works…\nI haven't imported my phone's photos manually.\nScreenshot:\n\n(\"flux de photos\" means photo stream, \"févr\" means february, \"janv\" means january)\n\nA: Some explanations about where your iPhone photos are stored: \n\n\n*\n\n*the iPhone Camera Roll\nSure. This is the only standard thing that happens.\n\n*the iCloud photo stream\nHappens only when you have enabled the My Photo Stream option in Settings->iCloud->Photos\n\n*iPhoto/Aperture projects\nWill be the case if you connect your iPhone to you Mac and sync/export your photos.\n\nNow based on the above, deleting photos from you Camera Roll do the follow in each case:\n\n\n*\n\n*will simply... delete them from your Camera Roll. They may still be in the Recently Deleted Album of your phone for some days.\n\n*will also delete them from your Photo Steam since this is something for sharing, not storing/backing-up. Do not confuse this with the iCloud Photo Library (Beta)\n\n*will not affect your photos in the iPhoto projects, since these are not synced automatically or something.\n\n\n\nEdit after your explanations:\nDeleting a photo from your Camera Roll will also delete it from the Photo Stream. And this applies to all your linked devices.\nOne should think the Photo Stream as a single common Album that all the devices have access to. Hence, any change to it, is reflected to all devices.\n\nLong story short, if you have your photos saved in your mac you can safely delete them from your iPhone. If you feel uneasy with that, you can simply try it with a couple of photos and make sure that everything worked as you expected\n\nA: I downloaded Dropbox and save them in the Camera Uploads file included. Every photo I've ever taken remains in this folder despite what I've deleted on my iphone or from my iCloud account. Unless I manually delete them from the file, there they remain. A real life saver. \n\nA: Easiest thing on the world: start using Dropbox, automatically upload your photos there. Never lose a photo and you can delete all photos and videos from the iPhone and still access those uploaded photos via Dropbox app.\n\nA: Take a look at AnyTrans; it's not expensive and it works well. I can simply copy all my photos and paste them anywhere on the Mac HD or USB HD.\nI was struggling before I used to this program.  \nI am used to a PC where this sort of thing is easy.\n\nA: To clear your iPhone's camera roll without losing any photo, get the Utiful app. Utiful is a complementary photo library, so you can freely move photos between the Camera Roll and the Utiful folders. So, unlike the Photos app than only duplicates photos into albums, Utiful makes it finally possible to physically MOVE photos out of the Camera Roll.\nIt's available both for iPhone and iPad, here's the link to the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/utiful-divide-rule-your-photo/id1034958660?ls=1&mt=8\n\nA: Since all of my pictures were sent to my mac, I just went into Finder, opened up a new folder on my desk top.  I then went into my photos and selected them all and moved them into the folder.  I then shut off iCloud on my phone and moved everything back into my photos.  Now, I am keeping iCloud off until they come up with a solution to delete without deleting everything.  I don't mind downloading from my phone onto my mac.  \n\nA: I had a similar issue trying to free up space on my iPhone.  At first I thought it was the trick Apple uses to force you to download and update the iOS.  But it's not.  It's the crappy storage on a 16G iPhone.  \nMy first recommendation is to upgrade the phone to a larger capacity iPhone, but if that's not an option (i.e. tight budget and/or company phone) there is another way to limit the Photos app's impact on your storage.  \nThis background info is necessary.  In addition to a 16G iPhone, I also have a Mac computer, both are for work.  I had iCloud Photo Library enabled on both devices, which means all my photos had been synced to iCloud.  In order to free up space (on the iPhone, not iCloud) yet not lose all my photos in the iCloud Photo Library, I had to do two simple tasks, consecutively:  \n\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac, open Photos>Preferences and enable \"Download Originals to this Mac.\" This will keep the Photos from being lost after step 2.  If this was not already enabled, it may take some time to download the original photos and videos, relative to how many you have stored on iCloud Photo Library.  Also make sure that your WiFi is working and that it is enabled on your iPhone.  \n\n*ONLY AFTER STEP 1 IS COMPLETE:  On the iPhone, open Settings>iCloud>Photos and disable \"iCloud Photo Library.\"  This will remove all photos from the iPhone, but as long as you follow Step 1 first, you're okay.  Not sure about folks without a Mac, but I imagine the concept is the same.  \nOnce these steps are completed, you will now have removed the photos from you iPhone.  Any new photos will no longer sync to your iCloud Photo Library automatically.  You will need to plug the iPhone in to your Mac and upload it to the Mac the old-fashioned way.  The Mac will upload them to iCloud (if enabled).  \nIf you have a larger storage capacity iPhone, it is a little more convenient to leave this feature enabled so that the photos can sync wirelessly via iCloud.  But if you have a 16G iPhone, it will only set you back if you're having the storage issues that come with a 16G iPhone.   \nHope this helps!  Please comment if there's a better way....I'll use it myself!\n", "Q: Apple TV stops playing the video from movies at 10 minutes My 2nd gen Apple TV pretty consistently freezes the video but not the audio of purchased content (movies or TV shows Edit from iTunes-see comment below) at exactly 10 minutes in.  It doesn't happen 100% of the time, but it does probably 75% or more.  My work around is to hit the menu button to exit the movie and then play it again resuming where I left off.  Usually it'll only happen once, but rarely it will continue to freeze at random or at 10  minute intervals.  I have fast internet and a good WiFi connection.  This has been happening consistently for over a year.  Has anyone seen this problem?  Any idea how to fix it?\nUpdate: My old TV (2008 Samsung) died so I replaced it with a 2015 Sony which unfortunately didn't solve the problem.  Nobody else seems to have this problem, so I'm pretty sure that my Apple TV is slightly broken.  I'll probably just replace it when Apple releases a new model (hopefully next month).\n\nA: Try restarting your Apple TV.\nHold down the Home and Play buttons on the Siri remote, or hold down the 'down' button and the menu buttons.\nImages below\nThe light will flash quickly, then let go of the buttons.\nYou will see the apple logo.\nTry watching your movies now!\n \n\nI hope this works for you!\n\nA: It sounds like something is going wrong with the way the AppleTV software is communicating with the iTunes CDN. Does anything similar happen when you try listen/view TV Shows, Video Podcasts, or listen to (fairly long) songs? The reason I ask, is it may help differentiate why it is occurring with videos and not other iTunes media.\nThere is a very big difference in the way that Netflix and Hulu stream their content as opposed to an iTunes movie. iTunes actually downloads the entire movie onto the AppleTV and begins playing it when enough has downloaded so that the playhead won't catch up to the downloaded portion.\nNetflix and Hulu (and most others) don't use this method. They use a more \"on-the-fly\" streaming approach which takes up minimal space on the AppleTV's hard drive.\nI guess what I'm trying to say is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could have a software issue (or maybe the drive on the AppleTV is full of cached data—which would be odd)\n\n*Or you have a hardware issue: maybe the internal HD is failing, the internal airport card, etc.\n\n\nTo fix a software issue, the easiest and best thing to do is to completely reset the AppleTV. To do that, follow the instructions here.\nTo fix a hardware issue (if the restore doesn't work), if it's been under a year, I would take it in to the Genius Bar or call Apple at 1-800-275-2273.\nBest of luck to you!\n\nA: You can solve this in 4 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Go to the General menu\n\n*Go to the Autolock section\n\n*Set it to Never\n\n\nA: Based on the comments, I would suggest trying a new HDMI cable.

In OS X when Calendar.app is closed I get notifications about events; how can I have this work in Mail.app? While Mail is closed I want to get new email notifications.\n\nA: You cannot.\nYou need the Mail app running. Unlike Calendar events, checking for emails is not something that can run locally. A client application needs to connect with your mail server and retrieve your e-mails.\nSure there could be some background processes that does that without the need of the Mail app, but it would not make much sense; in the end you would still have a process doing the checking.\n\nSomething that may make the Mail app less intrusive to you desktops' organization etc is having it been launched automatically and hidden at startup.\n\nA: System preferences>Users>Login Items> + > Mail >Check off the hidden button.\n", "Q: UI Guidelines : Left Navigation button should be a previous button I've recently heard the that statement that the left navigation button should be a previous button and should not be used to display a menu. \nIs that statement present in an offical guideline document or a WWDC video ? \n\nA: In an official Apple HIG there's the statement:\n\nWhen the user goes to a new level in a navigation hierarchy, two things should happen:\n\n*\n\n*The navigation bar title should change to the new level’s title, if appropriate.\n\n*A back button should appear in the left end of the bar; it can be labeled with the previous level’s title if it adds value.\n\n\nI do not recall any information about this in WWDC videos.\n\nA: I found the WWDC video that's going that direction : \nDesigning Intuitive User Experiences (Apple iOS developer membership required). \n", "Q: Kernel_task boosts CPU to 300%-500% (Yosemitte MBP 2011 without a battery) Long story short, my oldie MBP 2011' battery started bloating, I've contacted a repair service center and they advised me to remove the battery and use it on AC power, while they get a new battery for a replacement. What I've noticed a few days back, that my MBP starts extremely lagging from time to time. After a restart, it works fine for 12 - 20 hours and then the problem appears again. I've noticed that when the lagging starts, kernel_task begins consuming up to 500% CPU. So I bet that the problem's source is kernel_task, but what causes its extreme rise? Could it be a removed battery?\n\nA: One troubleshooting step is to see which files are being modified while kernel_task is consuming 500% CPU. In Terminal:\n  sudo fs_usage -f filesys\n\nYou will see a lot of files fly by. Just scroll up to get an idea of what files are being written or read.\n\nA: Actually, I have heard anecdotal evidence that removal of the battery does cause the system to throttle the CPU under certain circumstances. I also believe this can cause the kernel task to \"absorb\" the theoretical CPU capacity that would be there if it were running at full frequency.\nThe steps to isolate this would be to monitor the internal temperatures when the anomalous performance statistics are in effect. By keeping the machine cool, you will be sending a signal to the CPU that it can run at full capacity. Also, if the magsafe power adapter is getting old or the power circuitry on the Mac is starting to fail, it could also cause the internal voltages to drop and that also could affect the CPU.\nIt's much, much, much more likely you have a run of the mill software bug where some program has a memory leak or spins off children processes - so running sudo sysdiagnose before and during the periods of bad activity will help collect the logs needed to tell if it's an ordinary software issue or a much less likely \"oddball\" effect of having no battery to keep the voltage high when current draw is high and/or some aging hardware that is interacting with the CPU throttling firmware.\n", "Q: Access Keychain Access password generator (password assistant) via Terminal without the user interface Is it possible to access, the \"password assistant\" also known as the password generator located inside the Keychain Access via terminal or otherwise?\nSteps to access in UI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Keychain Access\n\n*New password item\n\n*Select padlock item (generate password)\n\n*Create random password according to security level \n\n\nA: Your exact question has been asked on Stackoverflow in 2009.

It's actually pretty easy (but a little tedious). Just like you can drag a selected color from the picker to create a default (opened with the picker wheel) color OR create a new palette – once you've selected your color it will appear in the presets as the \"current fill\". Then, just drag the \"current fill\" color box onto the default palette color you want to modify. \n\nHere I've already dragged my grayscale and just added light indigo from dragging the current fill box to the color fill box. \n\nA: There is an app that quickly converts your colors from Adobe ASE files into an Apple custom color palette. It is called the Color Palette Converter and you can get it on the Apple Store for $4.99. If you are an Adobe user you just make sure all the colors you want to use are in the Swatches panel of Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and then choose Export to ASE from the Swatches panel menu.

After this selection change, everything is back.\n\nA: In addition to Mission Control, I also have Screen Saver assigned to a hot-corner and engaging the screen saver, then exiting, fixes the issue for me.\nI haven't tried engaging the screen saver via hot-keys, but I did try to \"Preview\" the screen saver from system settings and that didn't work for me.\nI'm on El Capitan now, but have had this issue for at least the two previous OS releases.\n\nA: *\n\n*go to System Preferences -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> Mission Control\n\n*disable all \"Switch to desktop\"\n\n*execute in Terminal: killall Dock\n\n*enable previously disabled shortcuts\n\n\nA: Had this issue November 2016 running OS 10.12.1 \"Sierra\" an additional symptom is that hot corners were not working. I fixed it by opening Activity Monitor, Quit the dock (force quit was not necessary). Went back to normal\n\nA: I had this problem and tried all of the above.   Turns out my function keys were set to be standard functions keys, not the apple special key overlays.  Fixed in Keyboard settings with one click.   I reckon one of my kids changed it over at some point when playing a game ... \n\nA: For me, F3 didn't work but ctrl+up did, tried all answers here and nothing.\nSo, I checked with the keyboard viewer if the keys were working as expected and that was the reason, F3 key simply stopped working.\nSo I just simply changed the default ctrl+up behaviour to work with F5 (I don't need to control keyboard brightness as I have a standard keyboard)  and problem solved (clearly, when I get used to this new key).\n\n", "Q: iPhone Contact List - Custom Labels recognized as a Mobile Number When a number is labeled as \"mobile\" in your contact list, you can click the little \"cloud\" shortcut to send a text message to that number.\nIf the number is labeled as \"Home\" or anything else, that text message short cut goes away (because the system thinks it is not a mobile number)\nMy question is, can you use a custom label and somehow tell the system that the number is a mobile number so you can send text messages to it?\nI have a lot of contacts that have more than 1 cell phone and it would be nice to be able to label them as something other than \"mobile\" so that I know which cell phone i'm texting.\nHaving all the numbers labeled \"mobile\" does nothing to let me know which number is which.\n\nA: If you set it first set it to Mobile or iPhone, then select Add Custom Label, it should treat the device as a mobile device (since that was the last \"non-custom\" label selected).\n", "Q: Unclear iCloud Photo Library Feature If I fill up the space on my iPhone with photos, but those photos are synced with iCloud Photo Library, how do I remove those photos from my iPhone without deleting them from iCloud Photo Library. Hence, when I try to delete a photo it says: \n\nThis photo will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your\n  devices.\n\nSeems like I'm stuck?\n\nA: Since your goal is to free up space, you can configure your iPhone to only store thumbnails of the photos you have in iCloud Photo Library rather than the full-resolution images.\nThis is configured in Settings > iCloud > Photos > Optimize iPhone Storage (as opposed to Download and Keep Originals)\nSee this iMore article for more information on optimising storage.\nIt is not currently possible to completely remove photos or videos from one device when using iCloud Photo Library. This is clarified in the iCloud Photo Library beta FAQ:\n\nDeleting a photo or video from your Photos app will also remove the\n  item from iCloud Photo Library and from your iCloud storage\n  allocation.\n\nThe solution would be to disable iCloud Photo Library, allowing you to delete certain photos from certain devices, but then new photos would not be synchronised automatically.\n", "Q: Disable user login MacBook Pro Yosemite 10.10.2 I have a question. How can I disable the login on mac with os yosemite 10.10.2 Everytime when I want to start on the laptop I have to input my password and login. I want to disable this one. I tried to disable from security& Privacy section or users and groups but failure....can somebody help me please\n\nA: You can enable Automatic Login in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Automatic login.\nIf the Automatic login function is disabled then according to this The WP Guru post there are two things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*FileVault is not enabled. If it is, you cannot use Automatic login. Check in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault\n\n*You are not using your iCloud password for your Mac account. If you are, change it to a separate password and you should be able to use Automatic login.\n\n\nA: Thank you.....\"You can enable Automatic Login in System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Automatic login.\"\nA bit more, you need to open the lock and click on your User name. It will request a password. Type in and re-lock\n\nA: If you don't want a password, when it goes your main account, put in your password and when it asks you to put in a new password leave it blank. It'll say, \"You have not put in a password for this account\". Click on \"okay\".\n\nA: Ever since I updated to El Capitan, I can't log in automatically into my user account (without giving password, I mean). Everyone says to uncheck the automatic login button in the Apple -> System Preferences -> Users & Group -> Option section. But the automatic login button is shaded grey, so I can't uncheck it, (yes even after I unlock the padlock). \nHere is how to enable that checkbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Users & Group section, the account I wish to automatically log in must be admin. Once on my user I clicked to change my password. It asked if I want to change my iCloud password or change my local password. Change your iCloud password. \n\n*Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Security -> FireVault, make sure  FireVault is disabled (if it isn't, then do so and it'll take several hours).\n\n*After FireVault is disabled, goto Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Security -> General section, unlock the bottom padlock, and you should now have a \"deactivate automatic login\" that appeared. Uncheck this as it prevents you from doing so.\n\n*Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Users & Group -> Options, the automatic login button should now have your user instead of the \"deactivated/disabled\".\n", "Q: iPhone 5s with question on calendar I started a new calendar.

I can't empty trash using Finder either (even securely).\nEDIT: StackExchange changes a litte bit the exhibition of the special character. Here's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: The quick and dirty way to trash a folder is to move another folder with the same name into the existing folder. It looks like you have a folder t which might be amenable to making a new folder on the data drive and name it identically to the folder you wish to nuke and then trashing the \"new\" t folder.\nIf that doesn't work, you should be able to open a finder window and attempt to rename the problematic file. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201583 for details.\nLastly, if nothing works, consider posting what format the /Volumes/DATA is via diskutil list and sudo ls -laOR /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes/\n\nA: On a terminal window, try the following:\nfind /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes/501/t/t/t -type f -exec rm -f {} ';'\n\n", "Q: Kill all non-essential processes I'm looking for a utility that will allow me to kill all processes that aren't essential to maintaining system stability in an efficient manner. I'm guessing the easiest way to do this would be to find out which processes are owned by Apple Inc. and exclude them from a kill list, if possible.\nDisabling login items is not an option as certain processes are needed at startup, such as a few different cloud services which synchronise files. Killing them on demand would be ideal.\nBelow is an example of what should be killed.\n\n\nA: The processes you mention would all be killed by one command:\nkill -9 -1\n\nThat would also log you out and kill all the programs you run so it's not ideal, but it would free and allow the OS to dedicate all further memory and resources to the system.\nPractically, you would need to use launchctl to list all user tasks and quit them one by one. The tasks you mention all get started when you log in, so killing them might not do anything but cause them to exit, and re-start.\nI would recommend instead of killing - doing the work to really measure the aspect of the system that's causing you constraint. RAM, CPU, Network, disk IO and focus on apps that impact that. The CPU times of the tasks you mentioned are so trivially small, it's hard to see them as any sort of problem, but perhaps you have data and measurements showing otherwise.\nOS X can run thousands of small processes and juggle memory, and it's a rare instance where one program has a large enough memory leak or doesn't idle when it's not in use that it's unlikely you have a problem that doing all the work to script a kill tool would ever make you back the time you spent on it. I'd say, work on that script if you need it to learn how things work and not to make any difference going forward. In this instance, don't solve the general problem is my advice...\n\n", "Q: installing a SSD as main drive I have iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 12 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 and I have installed a 128GB SSD into the system. Formatted it for mac and it is sitting empty right now. I have the main 1TB drive still installed and working right now with the OS on it. I would like to install the  OS on it and put all my other files on the 1TB drive that has everything on it including the OS Yosemite 10.10.1 . I have tried to set this up myself but have had to start over and ask for help from you fine people here.\n I got as far as installing the OS on the SSD and it worked fine, did not know how to remove the os from the original HHD  without killing everything on the old HHD so I stopped pretending that I know more then I do. So as it sites right now  128GB SSD and 1TB HHD installed on this computer  I have a time machine backup for the main HHD now.\n\nA: If you've got a functioning OS on the SSD then you should be able to set this as the boot drive in System Prefs. Boot off it and then use Disk Utility to unmount the 1tb drive. Test everything with the 1tb drive unavailable. If everything works fine without it then you can remove what you want from the 1tb drive.\n\nA: If you have chosen the SSD in System Preferences -> Startup Disk, and it is working, then you should have no problems removing the OS from the spinning drive.\nBut first, how and where did you install the SSD? In the optical drive bay with a kit is fine, in an external case is not fine.\nAssuming it's internal, do this in stages.\nFirst, boot from the SSD. Go to the 1Tb spinning drive and rename System and Library to something else. Reboot again. If this is successful you have set up your SSD properly.\nNow open the terminal and type the following:\ncd /Volumes/Name-of-1Tb-drive\nsudo chflags nohidden bin dev etc private sbin tmp usr var\nIn a couple of seconds, these folders should appear in the Finder window of your spinning drive. Drag them, along with Library and System, to the trash.\nIf you are feeling brave, empty the trash. Otherwise, reboot the computer and then empty the trash. (If it boots, these files are not in use)\nYou should see an extra 5-10GB of available space now.\n\nA: I know this isn't exactly what you're asking for, but if you're interested, you could make your own Fusion Drive.\n", "Q: When quitting one application, quit additional ones I'm trying to figure out a way to do the following: when I quit Logic Pro X, I want to also automatically quit other apps that I use with it, as they are no longer needed. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can create a simple Applescript to quit the other apps. To do it, open Script Editor and type the following:\ntell application \"AppName1\" to quit\ntell application \"AppName2\" to quit\ntell application \"AppName3\" to quit\n\nSave as Application.\nThen when you quit Logic Pro, you just need to double click on your new app, and it close all your defined programs.\n\nA: I would do this using KeyboardMaestro.\n", "Q: Folder with Question Mark On Startup, Don't Know the Firmware Password So my buddy's macbook one day just booted up with a folder with a question mark in it. Its an old laptop from work, which he doesn't work at anymore. I've been trying to help him out, but I've exhausted my knowledge. We tried to hold down the option key, but it wants the firmware password, which we can't get. I've seen an article on how to decrypt it, but we can't get it to boot, so we can't use terminal, and single user mode wasn't working either. Is there any way we can grab the password or get it to boot in single user mode some other way than holding Command + S?\nThanks.\n\nA: Note: This RAM change trick no longer works on 2010 or newer Macs. I haven't done this in many years, but it did help back when I needed it. \nIf your laptop is old enough, and you can easily get to the RAM, (depending the model):\nShut down the Mac\nDisconnect the power.\nOpen the MacBook and change the RAM configuration. Add or remove RAM so the amount is changed. Since the HD is dead, you won't need to have minimum RAM to boot OS X.\nClose up the MacBook.\nStart up and reset the PRAM by holding down Command+Option+P+R.\nHold these keys down continuously until you hear the MacBook chime 3 times. Release the keys.\nWhen you see the question mark/folder, power it down by holding down the power button.\nOpen the MacBook and reinstall the RAM, as well as a brand new HD.\nClose it up.\nRestore the OS with the installer of your choice.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite Crash - Can't Reopen App I have a really annoying issue that happens when I am using Adobe Dreamweaver. \nDuring saving when connected to a server and pushing files to it, it will often freeze.\nThe issue is, it locks up the app completely and I am forced to \"Force Quit\" the program.\nHowever, once I force quit I cannot re-open that app again without restarting the mac. \nYou can see a video here of it happening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBgQj_4fcIA \nSomething type of Cache or temp file is being cleared on restart and I would like to know if anyone knows of a way I can perform that same task through terminal?\nIt takes a lot of time out of my day when I have to relaunch all my tools sites etc each time it crashes.

I recently broke my iPhone 4s and am not due for an update for another year. My friend is going to let me use her old iPhone 4s. How do I deactivate my broken phone so that my friends phone will now be usable as mine? My carrier is Verizon\n\nA: You can call Verizon customer support @ 1 (800) 922-0204. They should be able to deactivate your phone and activate the replacement. Even in the case of newer phones that are unlocked like the iPhone 6 - you still need a Verizon rep to activate the device after placing the SIM in it due to how their network is configured.\n\nA: I simply put the old sim card into the \"new\" phone to immediately have phone access. I plan to call ATT and have the new phone officially activated.\n\nA: Try to put your device in DFU mode then do a full iTunes restore. If not fixed then vist the apple store or call Verizon Support.\n", "Q: Newbie One Hard Disk Two OS X How To? I am a long time Windows User, but newbie on OS X\nThis is a wonderful OS I use.\nI have a macbook pro with 500GB HDD inside.\nI want to one HDD install both OS X 10.8.5 and OS X 10.10.2, plus one more partition for save data, so when as need, I format any two OS X partition will not data lose... (So Total 3 partition base on my case there).\nBut I search APPLE official KB, not find any document as example like my case, just only see how to install the OS X on ext HDD only (Not the way I want to be).\nSo .... anyone can tell me how to do above? OR can it?\nMacBook Pro, OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5) \n\nA: I final do this with disk utility, then partition with 4. Each with different name etc such as OS X 10.10, OS X 10.9, OS X 10.8 etc.\nThen make the USB stick install OS X one by one and when installing choose install to which partition.\n", "Q: How to export all emails from a mailbox in Apple Mail I'm trying to export all emails from an account I have setup and mapped to Apple mail on my computer. There are 1200 emails. The account is no longer active so i'm trying to export all the emails in the mailbox in apple mail to an .mbox file that I can import somewhere else.\nThe problem is when I do an export of the mailbox and then import it somewhere, there are only 88 emails when there should be 1200+.\nWhy is this only exporting some of the emails and how can I make it so it exports all of them?\n\nA: I couldn't get my export working even with a mailbox rebuild.  However, my goal was simply to archive my old mail, and not necessarily to do so in the mbox format, so copying the raw mailbox via Terminal with cp was adequate for my purposes.\nAfter some trial and error, I found the path was ~/Library/Mail/V3/IMAP-<account-name>/.  Sharing it here in case anyone else is in the same boat.\n\nA: Solving the annoying Some messages could not be imported - Error in Mail.app.\nI figured out a pretty easy way to copy all E-Mails from my old MacBook to my new machine with Mail.app.\n(MacOS Mojave 10.14.2; Mail 12.2)\nDon't export your mailboxes as .mbox (Mail.app > Mailbox > Export Mailbox...)\nI pretty much always got the following error when I imported the previously exported .mbox files to my new Macbook:\nSome messages could not be imported. The partially imported mailboxes are located in the mailbox named “Import” in the mailboxes list.\n\nThe odd thing is that Mail.app doesn't tell you which E-Mails have not been copied.\nThis uncertainty is very frustrating especially when you want to move thousands of E-Mails.\nThere is a simple workaround using EMLs instead of .mbox:\n\n*\n\n*In Finder create a folder for every mailbox you want to copy. In any case you should create a minimum of 2 folders. You’ll see why soon.\n\n*In Mail.app select one mailbox at a time. Select all mails inside and drag & drop them into the corresponding folder in the finder. The mails are copied into the folder as EML. Note that it might take a very long time before the .eml files appear, but you can check in Activity Monitor if Mail is doing something, it'll be using a significant percent of processor (10%-90% of a core in my case). As a reference, for 10 000 emails, it took over 2 hours until the .eml were exported.\n\n*On the new machine open Mail.app.\nFile > Import Mailboxes… > Import data from Apple Mail\n\n*Important! Select at least 2 folders to import. If you only select one folder, Mail.app imports every EML file in its own mailbox! (This would work but it takes long to delete the empty mailboxes after you’ve moved all the mails into one mailbox.)\n\nDone!\nWith this technique I've copied thousands of E-Mails from one Mail.app to another Mail.app without any errors.\n\nA: My problem was here: https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/macos-mail-archiving-messages/\nBasically, click \"Options\" then check \"export all subfolders\". My export went from one .mbox at 44kb to several at 5.6GB. \n\nA: Ok, first lets get our numbers sorted out.\nSelect the mail box (Inbox) you are trying to export, then select all messages and use the Mark as Unread. \nNow look how many does it shows in that Mail box.\nNow the export should export all of them.\nNext is to do the Import Mail box to verify. Use the Import Mailboxes in the File menu then select the exported mbox file. The count should be the same as export. Now you can delete the Import mail box that you no longer need.\nThis is not to be confused with the Inbox on the server (from your email provider), which you can only access true Internet.\nSince your account is no longer active you can not get those messages from server anyway until you reactivate it, they might be still there for you to get them. If you deleted the Internet email account then the game is over.\nIn order to get more clarity, please specify what email provider were you using for that email.\n\nA: I also couldn't export the entire mailbox - only 200mb were exported. After I did a Mailbox Rebuild (see Mailbox > Rebuild in the Menubar), all mails (1.25GB) were exported.\n\nA: I have a deactivated email account, which I would like to backup all the emails locally as .mbox, and can be easily further transferred between different email client (i.e. from Mac Mail to Thunderbird etc).\nBut every time, I select a mailbox --> (right click) Export Mailbox, it only exports around 25 emails out of the total 2000+ emails..\nBy accident, I found a trick worked for me. One has to select a mailbox folder, and uses the small settings (gear) icon at the bottom of the panel, to do the export!\nThen you will find it will export all the emails contained in that folder!\nThis worked for me at least, but it seems it is definitely a bug of the software.. \n\n", "Q: Use *Two* Thunderbolt/Firewire adapters on MacBook for 400 and 800 devices? I'm completing an audio recording setup.\nEquipment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook 13\" Retina late 2012 with Two Thunderbolt ports\n\n*One Focusrite Saffire audio interface (Firewire 400)\n\n*One OWC Mercury external SSD drive (Firewire 800)\n\n*I already own One Thunderbolt/Firewire adapter\n\n\nQuestion: what is the optimal setup for these devices? Specifically, will I get full Firewire 800 speeds if I purchase a second Thunderbolt/Firewire adapter and run the external FW800 drive alone on that port?\nI gather from reading other threads that, if I am to use only the one adapter, I would place the FW800 drive first in the chain, and the FW400 audio input last. However, it also appears that, if the FW400 device \"talks a lot,\" it can still slow down the speed of the FW800 device. So, the question is whether that same behavior might happen even if the devices were each on its own adapter through separate Thunderbolt ports?\nOne might presume both devices would operate at optimum speed if on separate ports, but perhaps the internal architecture of the Macbook still handles them as if on one port?\nThanks.\n\nA: Each Firewire controller will be treated independently by OS X, and each controller will have its bandwidth set by the slowest device connected. So you could daisychain your devices but will only see 400Mb/s throughput, requiring you to use separate Firewire adapters if you wish to see your OWC drive running at full speed.\n\nA: The Thunderbolt ports on MacBook Pros are set up with one master controller per side of the laptop, whether it is a two-port or a four-port model.\n", "Q: How can I view (not download) iPhone pictures on a Mac screen? I have an iPhone 5 with various photos.\nI have a Mac desktop running OS X Yosemite.\nIs there a way to view a fullscreen slideshow of the photos on the Mac display?  I don't want to download the photos, just flip through them for display on the big screen.\n\nA: Apple's mandated solution would be to wait for the photos to upload to your Photo Stream or iCloud Photo Library, then start a slideshow in iPhoto or Aperture.\nAlternatively, you could make your Mac into an AirPlay receiver using a 3rd party app such as AirSquirrel's Reflector. This one is paid, but I'm not aware of any free equivalent.\n\nA: To view the pictures on the camera roll on your iPhone:\n  1. Plug in your iPhone to your Mac.\n  2. Open iPhoto.\n  3. Your iPhone appears in the Devices list on the iPhoto sidebar.\n  4. Browse your pictures.\niPhoto does not provide a slideshow of the pictures on your iPhone, though.\n", "Q: Mailto links on websites open iTerm instead of Mail In both Chrome and Safari mailto: links open up iTerm instead of Mail.\nThis seemed to have started happening right around the same time I added a shortcut through Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts to use command+enter to Send in the Mail app. \nBut I have no idea if that has anything to do with this problem, or where else to even begin looking.\n\nA: You can set the default Mail application, via Mail.app Preferences.\nIt is underneath the \"General\" settings, as \"Default email reader\".\nEven if Mail.app appears to be already selected it might be worth a shot to select something else, then go back to Mail.app in order to clear the cobwebs.\n", "Q: Bootcamp fail stuck at no bootable device (hold option not working) I've been trying to find an answer to my problem all day with no luck.\nI tried installing windows 7 via bootcamp this morning. I accidentally created the partition before creating a bootable usb drive with the copy of windows 7 on it.  Now when I boot up my mac, it goes to an empty grey screen then goes into the \"no bootable device\" screen.  I have tried pressing and holding option once I power on the laptop but that still takes me to the same \"no bootable device\" screen.  I am currently in the process of creating an EFI bootable usb and hoping that this will work. \nIs there something I haven't tried yet?\n\nA: If you reset the NVRAM, the Mac should find the first Mac OS bootbale volume and start.  If not, you can power down and try the option key again. \nIf that fails, your Mac boot volume is broken or your hardware is broken. Try booting to Recovery HD or internet recovery at that point to reinstall your Mac OS on top of your old Mac user and data. \n", "Q: \"You restarted/Computer restarted because of a problem\" on wakeup, Evernote? For the last few days I've been getting scared because of these messages that appear very frequently on wakeup, and almost always when I wakeup after a long duration. Sometimes it says \"you restarted your computer because of a problem\" and others it says \"computer restarted because of a problem\". \nThe first time I had the chance to look at the report (not this one) I thought \"oh well, happens\", but since then I got it a few times, one time the computer wouldn't wakeup. Today I got it again and got the option to see the report so I've pasted it here. As you can see, and I'm not sure this says too much, but in the report it's written that: BSD process name corresponding to current thread: EvernoteHelper. Is it safe to say that EvernoteHelper is the cause? If not, what do I do?\nMacbook Retina '13 2013 model running Yosemite.

screenshot:\n\n\nA: If the issue is happening whenever you have Evernote open it may be because it uses some function that could (not will) cause data corruption on the computer so OS X causes a kernel panic to protect its self. This function could be a old deprecated method Apple took out of the SDK during one of OS X updates.\nTo see if this is the issue either reinstall Evernote or delete it and see if that helps.\nEdit:\nIf deleting the app works but not reinstalling you may need to wait for an update to fix the issue.\n\nA: Look at your console logs to see what happened before the computer restarted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch /Applications/Utilities/Console.app.\n\n*Select All Messages in the sidebar.\n\n*In the log pane, scroll up until you see a highlighted message that says\n\nbootlog: BOOT_TIME ...\n\n\n*Scan the log entries before that to get an idea of the OS was going through before it panicked.\n\nA: I noticed that whenI added \"hola better internet\" in my google chrome and enabled the extension it started the problem after sometimes.

(i'm total windiot - e.g. is possible somewhat convert bonjour names-addresses to the \"windows nmbd\" or whatever?\n\nA: I think you don't need to register a new hostname if you're just about publishing web services.\nOn the Mac, you can register a new website with bonjour on the command line with\ndns-sd -R \"My Website\" _http._tcp . 80 path=/path-to-page.html\n\nyou can verify that it worked by using Safari's bonjour menu or on the command line with \ndns-sd -B _http._tcp\n\nBonjour for Windows is available (and is, I think, included when installing iTunes).\nIf for some reason you actually need specific host names, you could consider using dnsmasq (can be installed with homebrew or macports) to reroute your specific hostnames only (using your default DNS for everything else) and telling your Windows computer to use your Mac as its DNS server.\n\nUpdate:\nI failed to realise it's totally possible, you can indeed register multiple .local hostnames with bonjour, do it as a proxy like this:\ndns-sd -P myService1 _http._tcp local 80 server1.local 127.0.0.1 path=/path/to/service1\ndns-sd -P myService2 _http._tcp local 80 server2.local 127.0.0.1 path=/path/to/service2\n\nHere you're registering two services (myService1,-2) running on the same server (127.0.0.1, within different server paths) on port 80 as two different .local names.\n", "Q: Simple On-the-fly keystroke macro recorder?

My university uses a captive portal to connect via Wi-Fi.\nI was able to connect and log in just fine, but after I updated from 10.10.1 to 10.10.2, I can connect and get a valid IP but I cannot access the log in page through the captive portal.

I use a MacBook Pro with Retina display, OS X Yosemite (10.10.2), 15-inch, Early 2013\n\nA: I found a solution to the captive portal problem with 10.10.2...\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the internet via iPhone and USB cable.\n\n*Now also connect to the wifi network with the captive portal. Change the default route to use the wifi.\n\n*Now the laptop uses the phone for DNS requests, but routes other traffic via the wifi interface.\n\n*Authenticate on the captive portal page.\n\n*Unplug the phone and restart the wifi.\n\n\nWith a bit of luck the captive portal should remember you and you should be able to use just the wifi interface.\nMy best guess is that the DNS setup process fails (no /etc/resolv.conf file) when the captive portal firewall is not letting traffic through. OS X probably does some test to see if it's on the internet (probably tries to reach a URL like captive.apple.com) and if this fails then it just stops setting up the DNS system).\n", "Q: How to make Finder remember its window size and column sizes? OS X remember the Size of the Finder window and the size of the columns in Cover flow (or any other) view.\nIt seems like something very basic that should just be there.

I wanted to purchase an app during its promotion period but the app min version is 10.10 so Mac App Store complains saying that the app cannot be installed and does not even allow me to purchase. Is there a way where I can just purchase even though I might not have to download and install it. I searched and could not find any way (iTunes does not support). \nWhile I might upgrade shortly, it might take time since I want to take proper backups and then upgrade during which the promotion of the app might be over.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the only way I've found the App Store to cooperate with that was to create a user account on a compatible system from which to log into the App Store and download the now-compatible app. For example, on my Lion system with a 32-bit EFI, I was unable to download Mountain Lion or newer to install on my daughter's MBA. I had to log into her Air in my account to download the OS upgrade for her.\nNot convenient.\n\nA: I ran into this issue where I wanted to buy Affinity Photo on sale after winning an Apple Design Award while I still only had Snow Leopard systems. There was absolutely no way to buy the application on promotion on any of my four Macs.\nIn the end, I had to create an account on a colleague's work computer with Mountain Lion to make the purchase. I was then able to successfully download and install Affinity Photo on my girlfriend's MacBook Pro (she can use it too) and on a Mac Pro I bought later for multimedia work and installed Yosemite on.\nOn the other hand, what does work is moving large installs around from account to account via sneakerware. While the applications do need to be in the application folder, for the most part you can just copy your application bundle in. I was able to do this with the huge 20 GB Apple store version of Pathways to Eternity (not that I'll have ever have time or patience to play it, as I obviously enjoy writing detailed tech answers on apple.stackexchange.com more than playing games). This workaround saves an enormous amount of time and bandwidth for large applications.\nEven more disturbing is the situation with OS upgrades. If you have not downloaded an OS upgrade before the next one comes around, you will never be able to gain access to that version.\nMore precisely, in my situation with Snow Leopard, I never downloaded Lion. I cannot download Lion now: I'm happy about that, 10.7 was a dud. No harm done. I did download Mountain Lion (10.8). I can download Mountain Lion. Good. On the other hand I didn't download Mavericks (10.8) before Yosemite (10.10) came out. I'll never be able to download Mavericks from my Apple account. The same issue may come up with El Capitan 10.11 (although I don't think I want El Capitan any more than I wanted Lion).\nWorkaround: once you've downloaded an OS upgrade you can save it and burn it to USB key for use on multiple computers and even other people's computers. I recommend doing this. This is what I would have to do to get Mavericks.\n", "Q: Any way to manage options in Open With dialog?

It only happens sometimes and I can't really examine a pattern. It's not bound to a specific app, specific time, I don't know, it just hangs the system completely sometimes when changing from integrated to discrete GPU, the screen, including the cursor is completely frozen, and the only way out is as system reset by pressing the power button. I've been using my computer for longer than a month and I've started having these crashes only in the last week or so. I don't want to disable automatic graphics switching as it helps me to preserve battery when I travel, and I also play games/use graphics intensive apps like Photoshop, Premiere etc. so I also can't stick to integrated too.\nI'm on 10.10.2 (it might have started since I've upgraded to 10.10.2, but I can't really rely on it -- no it's not, after revealing a log file from 10.10.1), my integrated is Intel Iris Pro, and my discrete is NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB, and I'm using the 1920x1200 'scaled' resolution (the one in default options, so it renders at 3840x2400 and downscales), if it helps, and those are the settings that I've been using since the day I've bought my Mac. I'm sure that it's GPU switching related because it exactly happens at the point where GPU switches when starting discrete-GPU-using apps, and the first time it happened, my Mac displayed a message telling me that it shut down due to a graphics related problem. I've just sent the report and it's not displayed after any of the crashes again (if it did, I'd note it somewhere and post it here). I get GPU switches many times a day, and it seems to happen only in 20-30 of the times. Otherwise, my system has no issues, no heating, abnormal fans etc. everything is smooth, including the GPU (unless it crashes).\nWhy would this be?\nUpdate: I've found the crash logs in Console.app. There are a few files like Kernel_2015-01-27-183045_Cans-MacBook-Pro.gpuRestart with content almost the same.

However, it's just my personal assumption after examining the log. I could post the whole crash dump, but I don't think if it will mean anything here.\nUPDATE 2: It happened to me again, I was listening to music and music kept playing, indicating that the system itself didn't hang completely at all.\n\nA: I can assure you that it's not a hardware problem. It's a software problem that Apple doesn't seem to have fixed with the latest updates. I disabled graphic switching in energy preferences, and my crashes are gone. And I mean severe crashes that happened a lot! Total system freezes, except for the mouse pointer. System freezes mostly mean it's a kernel thing, like a video driver that causes it. Try it, disable the switching and the problem should be gone. \nToo bad this means my Mac gets much warmer with the NVideo GPU running. You can also try the gfxCardStatus app to disable the switching and stick to the IRIS Pro 'Integrated' GPU.\n\nA: This may be a hardware fault.  I would try running AST or ASD tests on the device to see if it fails.  If so should be covered under your warranty.\n", "Q: Maximum memory config for Mac Pro 5,1 (mid 2010)? I have a MacPro5,1 with 8 cores (2 quad-core processors) running OS X 10.10.2.  From what I have read as per EveryMac.com's information about this unit it should be possible to have far beyond the normal maximum noted by Apple:\n\nActual Maximum RAM\n...\nSystems with dual processors, which EveryMac.com notes as the \"Eight\n  Core\" and \"Twelve Core\" models, likewise officially support 32 GB of\n  RAM, but again, OWC found they actually can support more. OWC first\n  confirmed an actual maximum of 64 GB of RAM running Mac OS X 10.5\n  \"Leopard\" and later increased this maximum to 96 GB of RAM running Mac\n  OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" or higher. More recently, OWC yet again\n  discovered these dual processor models can support up to 128 GB, but\n  only when running a 64-bit version of Windows XP or later or Linux.\n  Mac OS X only can support 96 GB of RAM.\n\nI initially had an arrangement of 8 4GB DIMMs. These brought my system up to 32GB.\nI then purchased 2 16GB chips in hopes to raise the amount of RAM, however my system would simply not start up at all.  Gave a fast power LED blink.  I subsequently returned this RAM and acquired 4 8GB DIMMs.  \nUpon installing these, my system still shows 32GB of RAM, but the 7 & 8 DIMM slots are showing empty now at this point.  Two of the DIMMS are being recognized while the others are not, even though there are 4 GB DIMMs in place and 4 4GB DIMMS:\n\nWhat kind of issue is going on here?  Obviously we're getting mixed messages with the info above about being able to accept much larger memory configurations, but in practice things get quite whacky.\n\nA: That machine will take 16's - my 3,1 does, to an unofficial maximum of 64GB [or more, according to Everymac, though I've not tested that myself].\nThe arrangement is not what you would initially think logical.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install equal-size DIMMs (for example, all 1 or 2 GB DIMMs) in your Mac Pro, Apple recommends that you fill the slots in the order listed in the table.\n\n\nNote: If you install different-size DIMMs in your Mac Pro, follow the order in the table. If the DIMM configuration you install doesn't provide optimized performance, the Memory Slot Utility appears onscreen and recommends an improved configuration.\n\nSource: Mac Pro (Mid 2012 and earlier): How to remove or install memory … & previous similar confusion when I upgraded mine ;)\n\nA: Okay, so ultimately there are some specific requirements that the Mac Pro has in terms of where you stick the 8GB DIMMs.  I am curious as to whether or not that could have had bearing on the 16GB DIMM issue wherein the system would simply not start up, but I wanted to at least share the ultimate configuration that worked after a couple of iterations (since the RAM simply was not appearing initially a few attempts had to be made) from from the suggestions of /System/Library/CoreServices/Memory Slot Utility.app: \n\n", "Q: yosemite upgrade error couldn't unmount disk single user did not work. \nrescue boot did not work. \nusb bootable installer via terminal diskutility did not work.\nis there any other way to format the disk of Macbook pro for a clean fresh yosemite install? It does not have firewire to try the remote boot.\nthanks\n\nA: Late-model Macs that do not feature a Firewire port can still be placed into Target Mode via the Thunderbolt port. This will require the use of a Thunderbolt cable between the two Mac computers for the connection and is available from Apple.\nModels that do not support booting to Target Mode are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Tray-Loading)\n\n*Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White)\n\n*iBook (\"Clamshell\")\n\n*Power Macintosh G4 (PCI Graphics)\n\n*MacBook Air (2008-2009)\n\n*MacBook (Unibody)\n\n\nIt's possible to mix-and-match ports, e.g., Firewire-to-Thunderbolt, so it is not necessary to have the same port types on both computers. Putting your Target Mode-compatible Thunderbolt-equipped Mac into Target Mode is done the same way as with older Firewire systems: Turn off the Mac, connect the cables then turn on the power and depress the T key until you see the Thunderbolt icon displayed on the screen. The drive should mount automatically on the other Mac, which should then make it possible for you to access the drive.\nNote that in Disk Utility, you'll want to select the Thunderbolt-/Firewire-mounted drive rather than its partition when you go to erase it. When you do erase the volume, be sure to give it the same name as currently used. This ensures that existing Time Machine backups can be analyzed and appended to with the new OS installation rather than discarded as belonging to a different system. Since Lion, OS X has been pretty good about being able to figure out when a Computer Name (set in Sharing) and volume Name (set in Disk Utility | Erase) are the same from installation to installation.\nBest of luck with it!\n", "Q: iPhone 6 suddenly lost it's \"Name\" (I.e. \"Nancy's iPhone\") We don't know what triggered it, but the specific name of our iPhone 6 \"Nancy's iPhone\" suddenly lost it's \"name\" and became \"iPhone.\"\nNow we're having issues backing it up, as the computer doesn't recognize it (since the name is now different).  How do we change it back?\n\nA: Settings -> General -> About -> Name\n", "Q: How do I insert a row into numbers, in just one column How do I insert a row in one column only. By moving the current data down and inserting a row above it. I don't want to insert a row across the entire spreadsheet - just that column.\n\nA: From Numbers help:\n\nMove rows and columns within a table Select one or more rows or\n  columns.\nDo any of the following:\nMove rows: After selecting the rows, click and hold the row numbers\n  until the rows appear to rise off the table, then drag them above or\n  below another row.\nMove columns: After selecting the columns, click and hold the column\n  letters until the columns appear to rise off the table, then drag them\n  to the right or left of another column.\nTip: If you drag rows or columns outside of an existing table, you\n  create a new table with them.\n\nThis has plagued me for ages and I took to forums to unsuccessfully find the answer, till I finally used the help function found in Numbers.\n\nA: In excel it is no brainier, just use copy and Insert and it will asks you to move that row up or down.\nIn Numbers I found this answer here.\n\nNumbers and Excel are built on different frameworks in the sense that\n  an Excel table/spreadsheet is virtually boundless and Numbers tables\n  are finite and generally only as large as the data requires. Pushing\n  some cells out of the way to make room for others has greater\n  implications in Numbers, and it is left to the user to make room by\n  moving the cells manually. I once counted mouse clicks to achieve the\n  insertion in Numbers vs. Excel and the difference was small to none.\n  Yes, Excel will move cells for you, but not until you tell it which\n  way to move them. With Numbers you just do it yourself.\nThere's a nifty command pair in Numbers that helps with the job. It is\n  +Mark for Move+ and Move.\nSelect the cells to be moved, Edit > Mark for Move, click to select\n  the cell where you want the upper left cell of the range to move to\n  and then Edit > Move.\n\n", "Q: Remove Documents,Downloads,Music directories from home directory How to remove those directories permanently?

I have a huge problem. My hard disk seems to be dead. I did a lot of things but I guess it's really gone. The thing is that I don't have CDs o DVDs of the OS X Lion (it's a macbook pro A1278 bought in 2012) and no backup in time machine. I lost all my files so I'm already grieving. \nThe thing is, if I buy a new HDD, how do I get the OS X there?\n\nA: *\n\n*Buy an SSD instead of an HDD if you can afford one. Believe me, you'll thank us. You currently have a MacBook Pro with a fast Intel processor but an extraordinarily slow hard drive. Your failed hard drive was your computer's main performance bottleneck. Replace it with a fast SSD from a reputable manufacturer like Samsung or Intel, and your computer will perform far better than new.\n\n*You could reinstall Lion using Internet Recovery. But, it would be much better to skip the outdated versions and install Yosemite. You can create a bootable Yosemite installation disk using an 8GB USB flash drive and a friend's Mac. Here are Apple's instructions for creating a bootable Yosemite install disk from an 8GB USB flash drive:\n\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download the OS X Installer app from the Mac App Store.\n  \n*Mount the volume you want to convert into a bootable installer. This could be \n  removable media such as a USB flash drive, or a secondary internal partition.\n  \n*You can then use the createinstallmedia tool to convert the volume from step \n  two into a bootable installer based off the installer app from step one. To learn how to use createinstallmedia, use the following command in Terminal:\n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\n\n\n\n*After you have created a Yosemite installation disk, insert it in your Mac's USB port and hold down Option as you power up. You will be able to boot from your Yosemite installation disk, just like you would from a Lion installation DVD.\n\n\nNon-technical users may prefer a more detailed walkthrough of creating a Yosemite installation disc.\n\nA: You may be able to do Internet Recovery by pressing Cmd+R during startup. If that is possible, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the new HDD.\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery.\n\n*Enter Disk Utility.\n\n*Create the installation partition.\n\n*Exit Disk Utility and choose to Reinstall Mac OS X.\n\n\nYou can test this even with the bad HDD still in place.\nIf your system did not come from Apple with installation DVDs, your system most likely supports Internet Recovery. You'll need an internet connection for it to work and, yep, it'll take some time to download that Lion image.\n", "Q: Get Keychain to remember an additional field I regularly log on to a financial website using Google Chrome\nThis requires me to enter a Account number, a password and also an Employer number.\nI store the Account and password in my Keychain, but have to enter the 8 digit Employer number each time.\nIs there any way of getting Keychain to remember this additional number.\n\nA: There's no way to force Keychain to store the additional field.\nI use 1Password for things that Safari/Keychain refuse to remember.\nYou can manually add fields for sites such as banks [at your own risk] where credentials will not auto-save.\nThere's also LastPass, but I haven't tried that\n\nA: That is not possible.\nBut you can use Chrome to remember your Account number, while the keychain can contain the Password + Employer information.\nHowever, some website (specialty finical) do not offer to save log in credentials for security reason.\n", "Q: Remove completed reminders in OS X and iOS I run the latest versions of OS X and iOS. Is there a way to mass-delete all completed reminders in both iOS and OS X? I’ve looked but can't seem to find a way so far. \n\nA: You can set it up in your Automator.\n\nYou can be selective what is to be deleted by using find or filter action first.\nTry it out.\n\nA: As of iOS 10.3.2, there is no way to do mass-delete reminders on iOS.\nIt is possible on macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the Reminders app in macOS Sierra, open the Scheduled list. Scroll up to reveal the Show button in the upper-right. Click that, then click the first completed reminder. Next, ⇧ shift-click the last one. Go through your lists to delete completed reminders that had no due date.\n\n*Using any desktop or laptop browser, you can visit the iCloud web app and do the same. The only difference is the Scheduled list on the website does not allow you to mass-delete completed reminders.\n\n*You can mass-delete reminders via AppleScript, using Script Editor.\n\n\nThe following script will delete all your completed reminders at once:\ntell application \"Reminders\" to delete (reminders whose completed is true)\n\nYou could tweak this to delete only reminders that you completed some time ago:\nset sixMonthsAgo to (current date) - 26 * weeks\ntell application \"Reminders\" to delete (reminders whose completion date is less than sixMonthsAgo)\n\nSave that script as an application and drop it in your ~/Applications folder. Then you can delete your completed reminders with a simple click from LaunchPad, or even from the Dock.\nIf you wanted to get fancy you could then schedule a LaunchAgent to execute this script every night, then forget about it. With the usual caveat about running a program that deletes stuff automatically.\n\nA: In OSX, go to Completed in Reminders, Click on the first one in the list, shift click on the last one, go to Edit menu and then Delete.\n\nA: As far as I know you cannot do it in iOS 10.3 or in OS X 10.12, BUT... you can do it on icloud.com. Simply click on \"completed reminders\" to expand the list of completed reminders (translated from French icloud). You can then click \"delete all completed reminders\". \n\nA: You can use Apple's Shortcuts app to delete all completed tasks in Reminders (tested & work on iOS)\nHere is the tutorial video:\nhttps://youtu.be/kz02-OgYp7Q\nHere is the screenshot of the video shows how to setup \"Delete all completed tasks\" button.\n\n", "Q: Low budget: Wait for a MacBook Pro or get a MacBook Air? I’m willing to buy a MacBook. I’d use it to code and minor Photoshop and video edit stuff. I live in Brazil - Macs are really expensive here. \nI found some deals and I can get a 13” Macbook Air 1.4GHz i5 4GB Ram 128GB SSD for R$ 3250 - ~1200 dollars. However, I’m afraid of it's performance.\nI can get a Retina 13\" MacBook Pro i5 2.6GHz/8GB/128GB SSD for R$ 4300. That’s a huge difference, but If it’s worth I’m willing to save money and buy it. \nWhat are your suggestions? I’d like to hear from who’s used both of them!\n\nA: If you are on a budget and concerned about price versus performance, I would recommend not buying a new model, but instead buying a refurbished model via a company like Other World Computing, Mac of All Trades or even directly from Apple.\nIn my experience, refurbished machines are as good as new and cost less. And in the case of Apple, they have the same 1 year warranty without having to pay anything else. And in many cases, the machines themselves are physically and operationally as good as new. Lots of times they are just returns from people who purchased the wrong machine or just decided to go with something else.\nAs far as MacBook Pro versus MacBook Air, the question of “power” is arbitrary at best. I do coding, systems administration and light graphic design work and I am using a Mac Mini. When I have used MacBook Air’s for this same level of work they work 100% fine for my needs. Some people feel they need “Pro” models because they have some self-exagerated requirements for the work they do; meaning they just want “the best” but honestly barely use the bells/whistles.\nUnless you are doing some highly system intensive work—such as editing 8” x 11” photos at 1200dpi for pre-press or HD video work—then a MacBook Air is perfectly fine machine.\n\nA: Wait for 2015 model. I think Macbook air's price would drop a little more. If not, get the Macbook Pro with retina.\n", "Q: Can't reduce size of OSX partition in bootcamp I'm trying to install Windows 7 Pro (64 bit) onto my new macbook air (OSX Yosemite 10.10.2). I'm using the Boot Camp Assistant and am at the point where it's asking me to create a partition for windows (with a slider). It won't let me reduce the Mac OSx partition smaller than 38 Gb. It currently says it's using 20 Gbs for OSx (18 Gb free), but I can't make it so that the MacOSx partition is only 20 Gb, which will give me more space for Windows. \nCan someone please advise/tell me how to do this? or do I manually have to partition the drives and install Windows w/o using the bootcamp assistant. \nThanks\nEdit: OSX Yosemite on a Macbook Air (Early 2014). After inputting \"diskutil cs list\", I get \"CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\". I just received it last week so it's pretty new. Holding Cmd-alt-r-down took about 3 minutes to boot up. I do have an external flash drive (64 gb, exfat) and I don't use time machine. \nI do not plan on upgrading/using the MacOSx, I just want to have it in case I need any warranty repairs (My coworker told me you need to have OSx installed for them to run diagnostics, else they won't touch your system). \nOutput:\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n +-- Logical Volume Group 0415F924-645A-47A7-B045-936E0F0AAD94\n     =========================================================\n    Name:         Macintosh HD\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         120473067520 B (120.5 GB)\n    Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n|\n+-< Physical Volume 536E4C17-EADB-4B7E-B71C-783BB62E2681\n|   ----------------------------------------------------\n|   Index:    0\n|   Disk:     disk0s2\n|   Status:   Online\n|   Size:     120473067520 B (120.5 GB)\n|\n+-> Logical Volume Family 17DE7604-0810-4971-86F5-DDD56E0979AE\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\n    Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n    Encryption Type:         None\n    Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n    Conversion Direction:    -none-\n    Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n    Fully Secure:            No\n    Passphrase Required:     No\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume 20593179-3E19-4A57-99D6-A713D13CE2FD\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        Disk:                  disk1\n        Status:                Online\n        Size (Total):          120154296320 B (120.2 GB)\n        Conversion Progress:   -none-\n        Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)\n        LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n        Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n        Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nUpdate 2: diskutil cs list now shows \n No CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\nbut I still can't slide the bar Past 38Gb (19 Gb free) for the Mac Partition.\n\nA: Update 2:\nI assume OS X is installed on partition 2 of disk 0. If you want me to check this, then post the output of the next three commands and I will verify. Otherwise proceed and attempt the resize.\ndiskutil list\nsudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\nTo resize to a smaller size, you will have to boot using OS X Internet Recovery. (Hold altcmdR at startup.)  Open the Terminal application and enter the following command.\ndiskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 limits\n\nHere is an example output. Your numbers will be different. \nFor device disk0s2 Steelhead:\n        Current size:  345.1 GB (345131147264 Bytes)\n        Minimum size:  35.3 GB (35299999744 Bytes)\n        Maximum size:  345.1 GB (345131147264 Bytes)\n\nTake the minimum size and use that in the next command. (i.e. replace 35.3 with your number)\ndiskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 35.3G\n\nHopefully this will resize to the smallest possible size. \nNote: When testing this procedure, I did not use OS X Internet Recovery. My 2007 iMac is just to old. I had to use a flash drive to boot the OS X Recovery System. While you can also create and use a flash drive, I just assumed OS X Internet Recovery would be easier. You CAN NOT use the OS X Recovery System stored on your internal disk. If you want to try using  the OS X Recovery System from a flash drive, you will need the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0.\n\nUpdate 1:\nJustin if you are afraid of violating the warranty, should I assume my answers should only be Apple approved? Well, that would just lead you to following the instructions that you have been already following. So, if that is as far as the slider will go then ... that is as small as you can make the OS X partition.\nOn the other hand, I would remove the Core Storage and then see if you can move the slider further. Why bother with backup anything up first. You are not going to use OS X anyway. The worst that could happen is you would have to reload from the internet. Your connection speed is fairly good, so that should  not take long.\nOf course, it would have helped to post more than the first line produced from the distutil cs list command. I assume you either misunderstood my instructions or are really bad at using OS X. I was hoping to determine if you had a Fusion drive and/or if Core Storage is revertible. Also, I believe you need the UUID to enter the command to revert. \nIf you choose to keep Core Storage, I would refer you to klanomath, he is far more experianced than me. (Actually, I have no experience with Core Storage other than reading his posts.) One of us could ask him for help, or at least, his opinion.\n\nWhat is the model year of your macbook air? You can find this by clicking the apple icon on the menu at the top of your screen, then selecting \"About this Mac\". Also, you might as well determine if you are using core storage. To do this: Open the Terminal application and type the following command. \ndiskutil cs list\n\nIf the output is something other than \nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\nthen edit your question and post the results there. Don't worry about the format, I will clean it up for you. \nI assume your Mac is new enough to boot off the internet. This is where you hold the keys cmd-alt-r down at startup. What I want to know is how long does that takes? Also, do you have any way to do backups. For example, do you have a external hard disk. If so, what format and how much free space. Or, do you use Time Machine? Finally, do you have another way to access the internet, other than your macbook air? If you can not add comments to my answer, the edit your question and post the answers there.\nHow to proceed, depends the answers to my questions. If possible I would backup your OS X partition. Then if you are using core storage, I would remove it. Core storage is only useful if you have a Fusion Drive. Next, if internet recovery is to slow, then I would transfer my Recovery partition to a flash drive. (You probably don't even know you have a Recovery partition hidden on your internal SSD.) \nIf you intend to leave OS X on your internal SSD and you are able to shrink to a size smaller than 38Gb, what happens when software updates need to be installed? Or, OS X 10.10.3 comes along? If you need to grow the OS X partition in the future, then the Windows partition will have to be removed to do so. \n", "Q: Can applepay technology be used to pay for metro rail and fares?

Are the technologies compatible?\nEdit:\nAccording to Wikipedia, the tap cards are based on rfid: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_smart_card#Technology\nApple pay is also based on rfid\n\nA: Sadly, No. Not at this time. \nThank you, \nRegional TAP Service Center\n866-TAPTOGO (866-827-8646) \nhttp://www.taptogo.net/\n-----Original Message-----\nSubject: Is taptogo compatible with applepay?\n\nA: Only if the Los Angeles county department that deals with payments have made their systems compatible with Apple Pay. You will need to ask this question of them.\n", "Q: What are \"Photo Stream\" events in iPhoto? They seem to have redundant copies of all my other photos, but bundled into month groups?\nI have iCloud turned off in iPhoto. But maybe I used to have it turned on.\nAre the photos copies? Or just pointers to other photos?\n\nA: You may have had it turned on in the past. \nGo to System Preferences>iCloud and remove the tick to the left of Photos if it's there.\nThis will switch off Photo Stream if it is still on. It is also explained if you click on the 'options...' button on the right of Photos icon. \n\nA: This is what I found on Apple Support page about how to delete phone from my photo stream, maybe it can help you.\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204022\n", "Q: Which OS X Lion or ML more stable on Macbook Pro 2010 Mid 15\" I had a old Macbook Pro 2010 mid 15\" buy from 2nd market.

I maintain a very clean address book (OSX), complete with photos and profile info of my contacts. Contacts are on iCloud and Exchange.\nHowever, sometimes I'll get an email from a contact and the picture won't show up. In fact, an entirely new email-entry shows up in the address book even if that email is already associated with a contact.\nAny advice on how I can make this stop happening? My Contacts is now full of duplicates. \n\nA: This will most likely be from contacts duplicated on the two servers - turn off the contact service on one of the servers and you should see your dupes disappear. We had this same issue recently when migrating from an in-house Exchange server to Office 365. Various users had contacts set up on both and were complaining about having duplicates in their contacts lists. Our policy is to leave contacts stored on iCloud but you may have different priorities.\n", "Q: How to launch an iOS Simulator with Safari open using a single command? I am looking for a solution to launch the iOS Simulator from command line with Safari launched by default. Launching the simulator from command line is easy. So is the launching of Safari.

I posted this question on the Apple support forum, but no one could give me an answer.\nI am researching iBeacons for my final year project at University and I'm interested to know the position of the Bluetooth antenna in the iPhones.\nCan anybody give me a reliable source explaining where the bluetooth antenna is located on the different versions of the iPhones? iPhone 4S up to 6 plus.\nCheers.\n\nA: There are teardown/repair guides at iFixIt, they note where the chips and antennas are located.\nFor example, in an iPhone 4S teardown, here's a photo of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip.\nThere is a guide on replacing the upper antenna - which is the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth one.\nAnd there is also a step-by-step guide on fixing the wi-fi which provides the detailed photos and description.\nIt appears that the Bluetooth antenna is located at the top of the 4S. The discussion of the iPhone 6 teardown also states that the Apple fit the antenna on the top. \nSo, iFixit has a lot of manuals and photos to provide. Also, they've got a great community, so if you have any further questions, you can ask them instead.\n\nA: Its on the top as when you block that area of the phone the bluetooth stops working\n", "Q: Loopback in Yosemite not working I'm on Yosemite (10.10.2). Since upgrading I got some DNS issues, it seems my loopback isn't working any more.

Any way that doesn't involve copy/paste, either using Mercury or any other browse? \n\nA: http://www.boxmydownloads.com/dashboard/\nLog in with your drop box account, paste the link to your video, and bam. It aslo works for PDF files, pictures, practically any type of website link.\n\nA: In addition to fiddling around in Mercury Browser:\nI found a collection of ugly-looking spammy apps: Video Downloader. I tried the purple one by Appsneon, it seems to work fine.\nIt shows a download button on iOS video player overlay, when browsing through the app. This is more convenient than Mercury Browser's approach. I wish mainstream browsers would offer this option as well.\n\nA: Downloading videos can be pretty hit or miss given the number of different video formats, players, server configurations, security settings, etc.\nI usually start with DownThemAll and FlashGot running in Firefox.  The old Miro app seems to only occasionally work.\n", "Q: Bootcamp - No ISO Option There is no option in the Bootcamp wizard to choose the Windows ISO.. Any ideas?\n\n\nA: If anybody is struggling with this on Mojave (10.14) it's pretty simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy Boot Camp Assistant.app to your desktop (just select it inside Applications/Utilites cmd+c and cmd+v on your desktop)\n\n*On your desktop, tap on the boot camp icon with ctrl + click which opens contextual menu, select show contents and open info.plist in Xcode. \n\n*Remove pre from PreUSBBootSupportedModels, so only USBBootSupportedModels remains and add your model in there.\n\n*Add your model also inside ExternalInstallOnlyModels\n\n*Open Boot Camp from desktop and you will see the option.\n\n\nA: I followed this tutor here and got success: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE8If6gabUI.\nThe \"Create a Windows 7 install disk\" option is hidden because your system's capabilities are limited. For instance, older Macs can not boot from external USB disks, therefore creating an installer onto a USB disk would make no sense.\nStill, if you want to create an installer on an external disk regardless, all you have to do is edit Boot Camp Assistant's \"Info.plist\" file:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open Package content of Boot Camp Assistant app, backup Info.plist file somewhere, then open the old one with XCode.\n  \n*Edit file:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Edit section's title: PreUSBBootSupportedModels to USBSupportedModels (if it's already USBBootSupportedModels -> skip\n  this step)\n  \n*Add your System's model identifier(Find it by System Information app) into USBSupportedModels section. \n  \n*Add your Boot ROM version (Find by System Information app) to DARequiredROMVersions section\n  \n*Save.\n  \n  \n*Restart BootCamp\n  \n\nA comment of @dusanvf:\n\nIf your Bootcamp crashes after this, write this into terminal:\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app/\n\n\n\nA: If the \"Create a Windows 7 or later install disk\" check box does not appear, then this usually means an USB flash drive can not be used to install Windows on your Mac. An example of this check box is shown below. Since your Mac does not show this check box, I assume you have an optical drive. You need to burn the iso image to a blank DVD using the Disk Utility application.\nNow there are ways to make this check box appear so the files can be copied to the flash drive, but most likely the firmware in your Mac will not allow you to boot Windows from a flash drive. Even if you can boot to OS X using a flash drive, this does not mean you can boot to Windows using a flash drive. You may need to boot to Windows from the optical drive to install it on to your internal drive.\nSteps to burn an iso to DVD: (Taken from Burn ISO in Mac OS X)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the “Disk Utility” app, it’s located in\n/Applications/Utilities/\n\n*Pull down the File menu and select ‘Open Disk Image’\n\n*Navigate to the ISO image file that you want burned and click “OK”\n\n*Insert a Blank DVD\n\n*Select \"Verify burned data\"\n\n*Click ‘Burn’ and wait until the image has finished burning to the\ndisc\n\n\nAs for the drivers for Windows. You can either download them using the Boot Camp Assistant or download them from Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems. You install the drivers after you finish installing Windows.\nOne final note: Do not change the partitioning using anything from Microsoft. The partitioning can only be successfully changed using OS X software. The only exception is Windows can format the BOOTCAMP partition.\n\n\nA: Here is the page which helped me to enable this option\nCreate a Windows Install USB on OS X Yosemite.\n\nCreating a Windows installer from OS X is actually quite simple - Boot Camp Assistant can do it for you. If you’re on a newer machine without an optical drive, you probably have an option that says “Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk”. Click that and point it to your ISO image. Done.\nIf you’re on an older machine (like my Hoth), you won’t find this option. Don’t Panic! Hacking Boot Camp Assistant into small bits and reassembling it will do the trick.\nFirst of all, we’ll modify Boot Camp Assistant’s Info.plist. It’s at /Applications/Utilities/Boot Camp Assistant.app/Contents/Info.plist. Open it in your favorite text editor. (Note: this requires elevated privileges).\nNote: If you are running OS X 10.11 or newer, you will be unable to edit Info.plist. Instead, copy Boot Camp Assistant.app to your desktop, and follow the instructions using the copy.\nOnce we’re in Info.plist, we’ll tell it which machines can create USB disks. Look for the key PreUSBBootSupportedModels. Change it to USBBootSupportedModels. Makes sense, right? Save.\nThen, we’ll need to resign Boot Camp Assistant, otherwise it will refuse to run. For this, we’ll need the Xcode command line tools installed. Then it’s as easy as\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app\n\nNow restart Boot Camp Assistant, and you’ll find the option you were looking for.\n\n\nA: This is correct. You need to have a bootable media with Windows on it to install Windows on bootcamp. When the process reboots to install Windows, the .iso will be unmounted and useless.\nYou can write the ISO to a flash drive (8GB or more) using disk utility and use that.\n\nA: Actually, if I recall correctly, the Bootcamp installer should make the bootable install media (8GB flash drive) itself.\nIf you just mount the ISO so that it shows up as a disk (double click on the ISO) that may be all you need to do. The BootCamp Assistant will then see the file as a (virtual) drive and copy the necessary files to your install media.\n\nA: Here as an article that describes how to get the option back\nhttp://tsentas.net/create-a-windows-7-or-later-version-install-disk-missing-on-el-capitan/\n", "Q: Apple terminal no home and end key - Use cmd left or cmd right How do I make\n⌘+← and ⌘+→ move the text cursor very left and right of the terminal entry line. This keyboard shortcut works on most things on my mac book but not the Terminal.\nUsually I use the home and end keys on other non apple computers. Strangely enough ⌃+A and ⌃+E achieve this in the mac terminal but it is the wrong key combination in my opinion. I want to do it using ⌘+← and ⌘+→.\nIt is similar to this question, however I want to specifically map it to ⌘+← and ⌘+→.\nCan home and end keys be mapped when using Terminal?\n\nA: You can use Better Touch Tool for this (it's no longer free, 5$ minimum), just assign keyboard shortcuts  to work in Terminal app only. Remap ⌘ CMD+← to ⌃ CTRL+A and ⌘ CMD+→ to ⌃ CTRL+E. Here's the sample:\n\n\nA: You can adjust the keybindings in Terminals preferences under Profiles -> Keyboard. This is on a Profile by profile basis.

It just keeps bouncing and bouncing and derails from my work. \nIs it possible to stop one app from bouncing?\n\nA: It's all or nothing with the Dock. You have two options: disable bouncing for anything and everything by entering\ndefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE; killall Dock\n\ninto a Terminal window, or modify and recompile Filezilla, which is not something anyone would want to do I guess. (A third option would be to get a new FTP client. Honestly, Cyberduck is really good.)\n", "Q: What is this iPad app?

I've been running Yosemite for less than a week, and before that I was running Mavericks.\n\nTime Machine only seems to complete a backup once or twice every 2 weeks. Today I got a message that said, \"No Backups for 10 days.\" I see similar messages all the time, and I think usually they say there haven't been any backups for 5 or more days. If I open Time Machine, I can see numerous entries in the timeline for the past several days--I assume these are the \"snapshots.\"\nWhat could be causing Time Machine to fail to complete for so many days in a row? Is there something I can do to improve its success? If not, am I at least safe as long as it completes once in a blue moon and shows recent snapshots in the Time Machine app?\nEdit: after connecting at work today, the Time Machine settings dialog said something to the effect of, \"Next backup: when disk is connected.\"  I unplugged the disk, then plugged it back in at 1:57 PM and it changed to, \"Next backup: Today, 1:47 PM.\" I still don't understand why it doesn't seem to detect the disk when I initially connect it.\n\nA: Are there any console errors?\nI would start with removing the plist, reboot, try again\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n", "Q: Can't download itunes album purchased on a different computer to Iphone I purchased an album this morning on my laptop at home.

I rebooted on the recovery partition, and tested my disk with Disk Utility. It showed a lot of \"orphaned inodes\".\nAfter a clean install and a few weeks, I had the same problem. So I started thinking the SSD was failing. After another few weeks, I couldn't even boot (prohibitory sign at bootup).\nI sent it to Samsung as it was still under warranty. They apparently tested it, and saw no problem at all. They formatted it again and flashed it with the last firmware.\nI received it two days ago, did a clean install, and today if I run Disk Utility, I still have these orphaned inodes.\nWhat can I do? Is the SSD failing, or can it be some other part of my computer?\n\nA: Orphaned inodes, are common, but they do normally get cleaned, latest after a restart.\n\nThis is not a bug, it's the journaling clearing up a normal situation.\n  An \"orphaned\" inode in this context is one which has been explicitly\n  deleted, but which was still open by some process when it was deleted.\n  The file vanishes completely from the directory structure, but normal\n  Unix semantics require it to remain present on disk until the last\n  user of that file closes it. At that point, the inode itself (as\n  opposed to the directory entries pointing to it) is deleted, and the\n  disk space used by the file is cleaned up.\n\nIn you case you use a application that does not release them (even if marked as deleted).\nYou could close apps to check, or use a terminal \nsudo iosnoop\n\nType Password and wait and observe.\nLook for who is still writing to the SSD.\n\nA: First reset the SMC:\nShut down the computer.\nPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\nOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\nRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time.\nPress the power button to turn on the computer.\nNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC. This much came from Apple's SMC reset insructions for you model: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295.\nNext, try the four-finger salute.  The technical name for that maneuver is \"resetting the NVRAM\". To try it, be sure the computer is completely shut down, then disconnect everything from the computer except power cable.\nPress the power button to start the computer and immediately hold down all of the following 4 keys as quickly as you can: command, option, P, and R (the maneuver used to be called \"resetting parameter ram\", hence the p and r). You may need both hands on the keyboard until you¹ve done it closer to as many times as I have.\nKeep those keys down until you hear the startup chime at least 3 times. It could take a minute or so, depending on the machine. The screen usually lights and goes dark again between chimes.\nWhen you’ve heard enough chimes, wait for one more. As soon as you hear it, release the keys and instantly press and hold shift. As soon as the Apple appears, let go of the shift key. That puts it in safe boot mode which also runs a file system check. If booting is still a problem, another clean install for OS X may be needed, and faulty hardware is still suspect.\n", "Q: /Volumes/external_drive folder not being removed I have a 2TB external HDD, formatted using exFAT. It seems that, even after I eject the disk, the mount point remains in /Volumes. Thus, every time I plug the drive in, a new mount point gets created in /Volumes using a numerical incrementer:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Volumes/external_drive/ \n\n*/Volumes/external_drive 1/\n\n*/Volumes/external_drive 2/ \n\n*etc.\n\n\nThis is a pain, as I have my torrents written to that disk. If I have to interrupt a torrent download and unplug the drive, when I plug the drive back in, the download folder ends up in a different place which causes problems for e.g., uTorrent. This can be avoided if I remember to go in and manually delete the orphaned mount point directory, but filesystem cleanup seems to be something that the OS handles. Is there a way to avoid this? \nNote for clarity: I am ejecting the disk (e.g., right-click on the desktop icon and select \"Eject external_drive\"). I am NOT just yanking out the USB cable.\n\nA: It's most likely that some program (probably uTorrent) is configured to access /Volumes/external_drive/. When the disk is ejected, that folder is deleted, but the program is re-creating it (because that's its configured location to store files), thus triggering the problem.\nThe only solution I know of is to make sure the program (again, probably uTorrent) never runs when the disk is not mounted. Quit the program (and if it has any background processes, shut them down), then eject the disk. And don't restart the program until after you've remounted the disk.\n\nA: This problem has been described on the ntfs-3g github page. It appears to be related to OSXFUSE:\nhttps://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/119.\nThere are a couple suggested remedies, including removing OSXFUSE, and using an older unsupported program with similar functionality, or else downloading and compiling OSXFUSE from the source (apparently the bug was fixed, but has not been released as of December when the thread was last updated).\n", "Q: Are all USB numeric keypads OSX comatible?

One of the games that I play (League of Legends, which has a 'beta' OS X client, but I highly doubt that this is the reason) sometimes runs slow on graphics-intensive scenes. Today, I forgot my GPU on 'Integrated only' (I use gfxCardStatus) and entered the game. Interestingly, the game almost never slowed down at all, even on graphics intensive scenes, running smoothly on 60FPS. I've upped the settings and it was still running smoothly at settings which severely affected GT750M's performance. I've doubled checked the active GPU and yes it is Intel Iris Pro. How can this happen? How can integrated graphics perform better than a GT750M on gaming? I know Iris Pro is a great 'integrated' card (compared to other integrated cards), but I highly doubt that it does better than 750M. If it really did, then why would it co-exist with 750M anyway?\nWhy would this be happening?\n\nA: Intel is making big improvements in the Integrated Graphics performances.\nThey are actually taking a portion of the Nvida market in doing that.\nTo Intel, the Nvidia is just a parasite, so if they can do better with the iGPU performance, ppl wont need it.\nIntel will be introducing next gen CPU with some powerful iGPU in 2015.\nThere is no official benchmarking for the Iris Pro vs G750 but as usual the performance is highly game type dependent.\nAs you have discovered for the League of Legends it looks like the Iris is actually doing better then G750.\nThere are some games where the G750 is doing better, like Startcraf2 and Heaven.\nsee this report for more.\n", "Q: Are older versions of iWorks available?

All well and good, but the annoying thing is that I've spent hours of my time working with the face detection feature of iPhoto and I'd hate to lose all the work tweaking the exception cases (i.e. iPhoto couldn't make out who someone was and I had to manually tell it).\nFor what its worth, I'm still on iPhoto '09 as iPhoto '11 didn't seem like that much of an improvement to me; in fact, the removal of the LAN sharing and obfuscated context menu items (e.g. reveal in finder type functions) stopped me from upgrading. \nAre there any applications out there which I can migrate to which would preserve all the face data from iPhoto '09?\n\nA: I haven't used it yet, but apparently the new Photos app will continue the face detection or 'Faces' work they've had for some time in iPhoto and Aperture: \nhttp://www.cheatsheet.com/technology/how-apple-is-reinventing-iphoto-with-the-new-mac-photos-app.html/?a=viewall\n\n", "Q: OmniDazzle alternative for modern Macs?

Could be flash related? When this happens there is no videos loaded in tabs but maybe one play triggers the problem.\nShould I just uninstall Flash from the system? I'm still on Mavericks and Safari 7 - will youtube play without issues via HTML5? I heard they made it work on Safari 8, not sure about 7.\nThank you\n\nA: I tried and in my case is the app Photos, and also there's this photoanalysisd process is running a lot of CPU too. MacOs sierra and 2011 MBP\n\nA: Don't have a right solution. But I also noticed that Messages.app is the problem here. After I quit the Messages app the process exited. Before that, even after killing it, it'd respawn each time.\n\nA: To find the program that is using this service, I have used the Energy tab of the Activity Monitor. Identify the highest energy-consuming app. Much simpler than spindumping as suggested in lowrin's answer\n\nA: I did a spindump via the activity monitor and so i found the resposible app.\nIn my case it was Firefox (HTML5 Vids)\n\n\nA: I saw this behavior after I accessed the People album in Photos on Sierra. I'm sure it's doing face recognition locally, since Apple bragged about it at the Sierra launch event.\nPhotos has a \"pause for one day\" button on the iCloud tab in the app preferences. I pressed that button and everything is now back to normal. \n\nA: Quitting iMessage ( Messages ) seems to kill the process.\n\nA: According to this website, the VTDecoderXPCService is called to sandbox applications that might play quicktime or other video content.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/09/apple_deadline_for_sandboxing_in_mac_app_store_arrives_march_1/\nYou could try quitting your applications one by one and seeing which ones are calling that process.\nFor me, it's usually Safari or iTunes and since you have it taking CPU that's pretty measurable, it should be easy to track down what's sending work to that part of the OS. It could be Messages or Photos, too.\n\nA: I wrote this guide if you want to limit the CPU usage of the process. It is horribly irritating and I shouldn't have to disable Messages every 15 minutes.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200809145136/https://blog.geesu.net/2016/12/05/vtdecoderxpcservice-using-100-of-your-cpu-use-cputhrottle/\n\nA: Quitting FaceTime closed the service for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem - VTDecoderXPCService process taking up about 30% of CPU and when I tried to quit it with the Activity Monitor, it just reappeared right away.\nI didnt have any video related apps open or tabs in Chrome. \nThere was a second process called Google Chrome Helper that was also taking up about 25% of the CPU. Weirdly, once I quit that one with the Activity Monitor the VTDecoderXPCService disappeared as well. \n\nA: My issue was Messages app, but it happened because there was a link to a YouTube video that in my messages. I played back the embedded version, and that's when the CPU usage spiked.\n\nA: Mac OS X Sierra 10.12.6 on 4 core, Corei7\nFacetime and PhotoBooth both launch the VTDecoderXPCService process and consumer ~30% CPU time.\n\nA: This issue occurs for me when I upload a photo to a website using Chrome. Quitting Chrome solves the issue, though temporarily till I do it again. Very painful!\n", "Q: Is using the Sprite Kit default spaceship image in my app a copyright infringement? I am developing a game using sprite kit.\nWhen we create a new Spritekit project, by default a spaceship image is present in it.\n\nI can delete the icon and make my own but I really like that icon for my spaceship-related game.\nCan I use that sprite for my game or it will be a copyright infringement?\nAnd what copyright usages are there on it, is it Public and does it have Attribution 3.0 license?\n\nA: Until you can find an explicit statement from Apple saying the artwork is copyright free and suitable for public use assume it is copyright and do not distribute it.\nIdeally, contact Apple Developer Technical Support or Apple's legal department and ask them directly.\nBe careful of assuming a right to use Apple's artwork or images. Apple have previously rejected apps from the Mac App Store for this reason.\n\nA: The Xcode license and your developer agreement are the two documents you should read carefully to be certain you understand your obligations, but Xcode is delivered to developers for the express purpose of making apps.\nClearly, the graphic elements like buttons and standard API are permitted use - royalty free per the licensing term. This is covered in the Xcode agreement which on some versions reads like this:\n\nF. Use of System-Provided Images. The system-provided images owned by Apple and documented as such in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for OS X and iOS (\"System-Provided Images\") are licensed to you solely for the purpose of developing OS X and iOS applications, respectively, using the Developer Software. Upon termination of this License, you may continue to distribute the System-Provided Images as used within software you developed using the Developer Software; however, you agree to provide to Apple, at Apple's request, a copy of any software you developed using the Developer Software that incorporates any of the System-Provided Images so Apple may determine, in its sole discretion, whether your use of the System-Provided Images complies with these terms.\n\nI've seen all sorts of programs use default sprites and effects, but you might want to consider paying someone for an alternate image if you are really uncomfortable with your understanding of the rules you agreed to to develop software using Apple's tools. To me, it seems that Apple would have paid for the rights to that artwork and you don't need to further compensate that artist as long as you are abiding by the agreements you signed with Apple to use Xcode.\nIf I were doing this, I would re-read the entire agreement I signed before sending that app to the App store - for many reasons beyond just this one image.  If you are paying to be a Mac developer, you can certainly ask developer support to be clear that they understand your intentions and you have something in writing before shipping the app.\nIt really depends on several factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will you then use this in marketing materials or does it just show up in the app?\n\n*Is it your app's Home Screen icon and store icon?\n\n*Are you going through App Review and only distributing your app through Apple?\n\n*What's the budget for your entire development?\n\n*Do you have a lawyer that you pay to keep you out of trouble?\n\n", "Q: No save button in Calendar on iPhone When I add an event to my calendar on my iPhone 5s, there is no \"Save\" button, so nothing gets saved to my calendar!\nI can set everything but I can't save anything.\n\nA: There should be an Add button in the top-right corner. It's called \"Done\" when you are editing an existing event. Those will save your changes and return you to the previous view.\n", "Q: Are copies using rsync faster than using Finder? So - I have a question about using rsync in Terminal. I need to move a Time Machine backup off of an external drive in order to reformat it. The 'backups' folder is nearly 300 GB. At first I tried to use CarbonCopyCloner to create a sparseimage on the disk I am moving the data to. That didn't work because, according to Bombich, TM backups are treated differently and can't be processed by CCC.\nThen I decided to use Disk Utility to create a new 300GB SparseImage on the destination and use rsync to copy the backup folder to the new SparseImage. I used the rsync command sudo rsync -va --progress and dragged the source and destination paths into the Terminal window. After I authenticated, Terminal started creating a list of files to deal with - but this listing task went on for hours, which seems to completely defeat the idea of creating an efficient transfer. What did I do wrong? Should I not have asked for verbose responses - or did I make some other error.\nEventually the task completed, but it took over two days using a USB 2 wired connection. Would this have taken the same amount of time if I had just dragged the folder across using Finder?\nObviously - I am a noob with Terminal, so any help will be much appreciated.\n\nA: You didn't do wrong, but the point with rsync is that after the initial backup/copy, subsequent rsync runs are clever enough to only copy/backup stuff that's changed. So say you do your 300GB backup, then a week later want to backup again, if you've only made 5GB of changes on your disk, then rsync will only try to edit/backup this 5GB, rather than you having to copy over the full 300GB again. This is the time saving you benefit from when using rsync, and you only get it when you're running regular backups of the same disk. \nSo the answer to your question is no, for a one off copy operation, rsync and finder are likely to be exactly the same - indeed, it may be the case that finder is slightly faster. Rsync is for keeping/maintaining an up-to-date backup of a working disk, and the time savings are in the long-run, not taking the initial backup.  \nTo get the benefits from rsync, you should take a copy of your rsync command, and store it in a way you can run it again at some time in the future (for example, you might embed it in a batch/script file that you can run periodically in the future). The next time you run the same backup, it might take 5 minutes, since it's unlikely that you will have changed that much on your disk. \nSo for example, here's the content of the script file I use to keep an up-to-date backup of my music folder on my mac - this is set to run every 24 hours:\n#!/bin/bash\nrsync -ariv /Users/myuser/Music /Volumes/data/media/myuser\n\nThe first time I ran this it took ages too, but now, when I run it again, it just backs up what's changed in my Music folder, and might take a minute or two. Meanwhile, I know that I've got a 100% up-to-date copy of my music folder in my backup drive that I can go to should my primary drive fail. \n", "Q: Software to draw on the trackpad I am asking about a software to draw figures and diagrams using the trackpad. I am already aware of Inklet, which works only in conjunction with other software like photoshop. I need another free stand-alone software that does not need other programs pre-installed.\n\nA: Notability is pretty optimized for the trackpad. Works well if you have an iPad stylus and use it on the trackpad too. Not to mention, iCloud sync and iOS apps to go along with it. Check it out if you haven't had a chance.\nIf that's not what you're looking for, then maybe Pixelmator is more your cup of tea. It is fully optimized for the Mac as well.\nTo be honest, when you say \"fully optimized for the trackpad,\" I think you'll find that there isn't much for that. The trackpad is great for a lot of things, but it certainly ain't no Wacom Bamboo tablet. In other words, it may be necessary to understand that the trackpad isn't specifically built for \"drawing objects and shapes,\" although a Wacom tablet is. The programs listed above will certainly get you the desired results without much trouble.\nOne other thought... If you have an iPad, there are a slew of apps that will allow you to use your iPad as a mouse or a pseudo-trackpad. It may be worth while stopping by your local electronics store, picking up a $10 stylus for an iPad, and using that for drawing instead of the trackpad itself. One example of these apps is Rowmote. I've used it myself for a few years and love it.\nHope all this helps!\n\nA: You can use Office 365 for Mac (requires Office for Mac 16.22.19021100). It supports usage of your trackpad as \"touch\" drawing - see here.\nWill copy here main steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Draw tab of the ribbon, switch the Draw with Trackpad option to On. A drawing window appears onscreen.\n\n*Use two fingers to move the drawing window.\n\n*Use one finger to draw on the trackpad. You don't need to press down to immediately start drawing.\n\n*For greater location precision, press the Command key command button.\n\n*Press any key to turn off precision-draw mode.\n\n\n", "Q: Stream video to TV over Apple Composite AV cable? I'm using an iPhone 3GS (iOS 6.1.6) and would like to stream video from the Safari browser or an installed app to my TV over the connected Apple Composite AV cable.\nIs that possible?  \n\nA: Yes you can do it. And you have one more option to stream to your TV at $35 or even $30 when on sale and that is chrome cast. And it is wireless!\n", "Q: iOS network connectivity on a local, isolated network with no DNS server I have a problem with configuring my iPad to work on a local, isolated Wi-Fi network that does not have a DNS server on it.  The problem is in how to convince the iPad that it is actually connected to the network. \nMy regular Wi-Fi access point is supplying addresses in the 165.156 block, and the iPad happily connects to it with DHCP and sees the outside world. However I need to connect my iPad to a local device with an IP address of 192.168.10.11 that is hardwired into my network, so I want my iPad to talk on the 192.168 block - but I do not want to change my WiFi AP configuration (because among other things this is test case for a clients network), nor do I want to Jailbreak my iPad.\nSo I manually set the iPad to a static IP of 192.168.10.12, for the connected SSID of my Wi-Fi network. When I do this (using a 3rd party network utility on the iPad) I can ping 192.168.10.11 from the iPad, and I thought all was good and happy.\nHowever with this configuration the Wi-Fi icon on the iPad is not displayed. From what I understand this means that even though I am connected to a network of sorts, the iPad disagrees with me, and that this because the SCNetworkReachability system can't find what it needs to determine connectivity. \nBut a commercial program I will be using on the iPad uses the Reachability system to determine network availability, and without iOS saying that there is a network that commercial program will not communicate with the hardwired device. Hence I somehow need to beat the iPad into submission and convince it that there is network connectivity.\nFrom Reachability\n\nIMPORTANT: Reachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before\n  it can determine the Reachability of that host, and this may take time\n  on certain network connections. Because of this, the API will return\n  NotReachable until name resolution has completed. This delay may be\n  visible in the interface on some networks.\n\nIt seems that I need to add some sort of DNS information to keep the iPad happy. However ultimately this all needs to run on an isolated network which will have static IP addresses and will not have a DNS server of any sort.  Thus there will be no external connectivity. \nSo my question comes down to:\nWhat sort of DNS configuration (and where), is needed in the iPad to convince the SCNetworkReachability system that all is well with the network, even though there is no DNS server in the system?\nUpdate\nAs per my comment to Triniq's answer, I do not have control over the target network and will not be able to install any DNS server systems.  I am looking for an iPad only solution.\n\nA: It's not a direct answer, but why not set up dnsmasq somewhere on your 192.168 network and use that hosts ip for the dns server in the ipad config? It should be a viable workaround. If this extra network doesn't have www connectivity, make an entry for apple.com in the /etc/hosts file where dnsmasq runs. This should trick the ipad to thinking it's truly online.\n\nA: I get online through a Peruvian cell provider.  But their DNS servers suck.  So I go to the Settings->WiFi and click the info icon.  Then I changed the single DHCP-provided DNS IP to two that I know work well.  The setting persists--DHCP does not override it the next time I get online.\nI used to have my Mac running a caching server.  I'm trying to get that going again, since that would be faster than the current method. \n", "Q: Adding text to PDF using Adobe Reader in OS X As can be seen from the screenshot, I have selected \"Add text at cursor\" and entered the desired text.\nBut as can also be seen - there is only a tiny very narrow entry there - I can not even discern if any text were actually being displayed.\nAdding text should be a simple procedure. What am I missing here?\n \n\nA: I guess we can assume that the document does not fillable fields (because if it had, the question would not have come up).\nThe \"Add text at cursor\" tool is a markup tool, used for correction text.

I recently updated my 2008 MB Pro (2 GB RAM) to Yosemite from 10.6 and I've found that it's often unusably slow. After keeping an eye on Activity Monitor over a couple weeks, I notice that the Image Capture Extension and software updated processes are often using over 400MB of RAM, 95% of which is compressed. \nQuitting the processes seems to make the system more responsive, but I assume that these are supposed to be running in the background.\nThe only applications I usually have running are Safari/Chrome, Textmate and LibreOffice.

You must enter your passcode on the iPhone before it can be backed up.\" but i can't put my password because i can't touch all the buttons to put it in. HELP!!!\n\nA: In case you have previously synced your iPhone to iTunes, it should automatically sync your device (with 'Sync' button). If you did that on the different computer, try connecting to it.

I have looked for information on the web, but while many pages describe how to enable remote access, I did not find any one that addresses the problem above.\n(If needed, I can have someone log directly on the Mac onto my (Administrator) account. Maybe ssh works too when the guest is logged in, I was not able to try yet, as I only have a remote connection.)\n\nA: Probably FileVault2 is enabled on the remote Mac.\nAfter a clean reboot and before entering the FileVault/user password the disk won't be available and subsequently the common network won't be enabled.\nAfter unlocking the disk locally you should be able to discover your Mac and ssh to it.\nIf the Guest account is enabled in the FileVault mode your Mac might be pinged depending on the network setup (DHCP), but since it is a special 'Safari window only mode' you shouldn't be able to ssh to it.\nTo reboot a FileVault-enabled Mac remotely enter sudo fdesetup authrestart. This allows you to restart a FileVault-enabled system without requiring an unlock during the next startup. Check this Apple support page for more information.\nIf FileVault2 isn't enabled i would expect that the sleep and Wake-on-LAN settings aren't properly set.\n", "Q: How to tell what program is launching softwareupdated? My Macbook was running really slow after opening it up and so I opened Activity Monitor and saw one process called softwareupdated that was not responding. It didn't say it was using any CPU but my laptop was crawling. I force quit it but then it restarted again. So I looked it up online and saw that App Store uses it (and maybe others). So I opened App Store and ran update. It seemed to use the process as it showed 104% CPU. Then when it was done it went back to 0 CPU. Still it showed in red that it was not responding. \nHow do I know what process is calling this? How do I prevent it from being called? \nPictures:\nsoftwareupdated process:\n\nsoftwareupdated process when clicking update in OS X App Store:\n\ndouble clicking on the process in Activity Monitor:\n\napp store preferences and settings:\n\n\nA: To answer your question which program is launching the softwareupdated:\nIn your System Preferences, click on the App Store.\nIt will show you the settings for updates.\nNormal is to have it check for Software Updates continuously, that will explain the softwareupdated running in your Activity Monitor.\nThere you can also set what happens next, like download and auto install or not etc...\n\nA: I was wondering why softwareupdated was always running in activity monitor as well. I believe i fixed my issue by turning off  \"Check for new software updates automatically\" in iTunes, in Advanced Preferences. \n(1) iTunes\n(2) Preferences\n(3) Advanced Preferences\n(4) unselect: \"Check for new software updates automatically\"\nSo far, that has solved the problem. Before doing this, I would force quit softwareupdated, only for it to pop up again almost immediately after. \nIt's not popping up now. \n\nA: Similar to previous answers but I simply went to System Preferences -> App Store.\nOnce there unchecked \"Automatically check for updates\"\nNoticed that softwareupdated was still running in the activity monitor so I did a force quit on it since I was too lazy to reboot. Been going for about a half hour now and that process did not appear again. Glad to have ended it because it was using up almost half a GB on my 4GB machine.\n", "Q: Only my cable can recharge my iPhone My iPhone cable is the only one that can recharge my iPhone 5. I have tested around 5 other iPhone 5/6 cables and none of them work. I am apprehensive of either losing my cable or breaking it.\nThe cable also doesn't always recharge everyone else's iPhone. But when it does, it's because it has been plugged using the \"right\" side as only one side works. That behavior applies to my iPhone as well.\nRight now my survivor cable has the same value as my phone. One can't go without the other. This is both magic and exasperating.\n\nI'm curious to know what could be the reason behind that behavior? Would you have any idea how I could fix this or find another way of recharging my phone without replacing my phone dock's connector?\nI'm ready to acquire another cable and make experiences on it. \n\nA: Although it was not exactly the same symptoms, I had many connection problems with my iPhone 5S at some point. I could use only some cables, and only in some positions. It turned out that the connector had gathered a large amount of dust (likely gathered in my pocket) that was \"compressed\" down the socket by plugging the cable. At some point, the thickness of this dust made it impossible to have a proper connection. This is hardly visible with the naked eye, but I eventually discovered it by looking at the connector with a light and a loupe. I then took away the dust using a sharp pin and the iPhone worked again perfectly.\n\nA: I just went to the Genius bar for the same problem because my \"special\" cord had just broke. They told me that they didnt know what had happened to my iPhone 5s and that the only option i had to fix it was to upgrade. They said that when they plugged it into their device that tells them how much of a charge my phone is it was flat lined, meaning it wasn't charging at all. I reset my features and borrowed one of their chargers and it started charging. He took my Phone back to see what it was reading, and one cord was charging it however another cord that was exactly the same was not. This even shocked the employee... he said he couldnt even sell me the one he had because it \"was his\". :\\ I don't know what was exactly wrong and I don't think they know either \n\nA: This has been happening to me for over a year.. I wrapped my special cord in electric tape because it was falling apart. I have no idea why that's the only cord that will charge my phone. We have 4 extra lightning cables from apple and none of them work with my phone but they all work perfectly with my husband's. My special cable can charge his phone as well. \nI get the message \"This cable is not certified and might not reliably\" when I plug in an actual apple lightning cable!\n\nA: There are 8 pins on each side of the lightning connector and a microprocessor inside the connector.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)\nThe device you plug in to (iPhone in this case) also has a microprocessor to determine if 8 or 16 pins should be active, negotiate what charging and data exchange will happen.\nIt's not a simple 4 wire connector that either makes a connection or doesn't make a connection.\nIf one phone doesn't work with an assortment of cables that work with another similar phone - then you could conclude a cleaning or repair of the phone is needed. Whether the socket was bent to just the right angle to work with your bent lightning cable or if it's another oddity - repair might be the best option if you have some cables that work and some that don't.\nThe pins can be corroded, bent, broken - just like any small connector - so getting someone with the proper tools to test and inspect both connectors is needed when a simple exchange of cables doesn't work.\nYou are right to ask for options other than repair, but in honesty - you should get a quote for an upgrade to a new phone and a quote for repair since they are probably the best way forward once your phone won't work with most undamaged cables you try.\n", "Q: Finnish Spell Checker for System of OS X? I know this discussion about spell checkers for Pages, here. \nI am searching for the files ending with .aff or .dic.\nWithout them, you cannot use them in system. \nMy current OS X is Yosemite 10.10.2.\nThe manual of OS X says that in Settings > Keyboard > Spelling > Set up ...\n\nTo add an additional spelling dictionary, copy the dictionary files (.aff and .dic) to the Spelling folder in your Library folder.\n\nIs there any standard dictionary for Finnish?\n\nA: Download Voikko spell for 10.8-9 from\nhttp://verteksi.net/lab/osxspell/\nand put it in System/Library/Services  (not Library/Services or Home/Library/Services)\nGo to Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar and set the dictionary to Suomi (not Automatic).\nAlso in Edit > Spelling and Grammar, check the items for checking and correcting spelling.\nYou should then see, for example in TextEdit, something like\n\n\nA: The Finnish language is not like others and the spell checking is more complicated than just .aff/.dic files. As Tom wrote, the solution is to use Voikko project's VoikkoSpellService (osxspell) which creates system wide spell checker for Finnish. \nIt works also on OS X Yosemite but the /Library folder is hidden and you have to make the Services folder if it doesn't exist.

Every machine you want to connect using screen sharing must be in a network with this port open.\nDid you tried Messages app feature to do it? You just need to select a contact, click on Details and Ask to Share Screen.\n\nOnce approved in the other side, you can see the other screen.

I can't find out any info about if iTunes is able to play H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) format. \nDo you know if this is posible?\nYosemite 10.10, iTunes version 12.1.\n\nA: No, according to Apple on this list. It does not contain H.265.\n\nA: Apple supports H.265, but so far only in FaceTime on iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. From iTunes menu, H.265 video files can not be read since iTunes have no ability of playing HEVC/H.265 format. Sometimes, even you can add H.265 to iTunes, you still cannot sync them to Apple devices. That is to say, users can't stream or even play H.265 video outside of the FaceTime environment.  \n\nA: As usual in OS X if you load third party apps with the codecs they most likely will become available to other applications. I can't give specific details in this case. Certainly BlackMagic Design products are starting to encode in H.265 so loading one of their helper applications may well get you the codecs onto OS X for iTunes or VLC or whatever.\n\nA: iVI Pro can convert from 265 into iTunes.\nI assume their non-Pro version can too, but that's what I'm using.\n", "Q: Clear Safari history & iTunes login I have installed Yosemite OS on my Mac and I encounter the following problem. Whenever I clear Safari history, then I always have to login to iTunes if I want to use the online services (e.g. internet music or online radio).\nIs this a bug or that's the way it works?\n\nA: That is sadly the way it works.\n\nA: Same behavior here. I believe that is how it works. To correct your question: clearing history won't affect that, only after clearing all cookies and data.\n\nA: If you use History > Clear History and Website Data, which is the only obvious option to clear history at least in Safari 8, then this is its intended behaviour.\nHowever, if you wish to remove your history but leave intact other data such as login cookies, you can do this by selecting History > Show History. Single-click on one of the entries to highlight it, and then click Edit > Select All. This will highlight all of your history. Click Edit > Delete to clear them all out (it might take a few seconds).\n", "Q: Is it possible to render $\\LaTeX$ in Safari? Is there a Safari extension for rendering LaTeX in webpages? That is, take expressions like $...$ and replace them in the page with the rendered LaTeX.\nI couldn’t find anything on Google.\n\nA: I haven’t tried them, but there are some bookmarklets written by a user on the Mathematics Stack Exchange which sound like they do roughly what you’d want:  Should chat have TeX support?\nIn particular, the “render MathJax” bookmarklet sounds exactly like what you want:\n\nrender MathJax installs MathJax and renders $\\LaTeX$ once per execution. This is intended for use on web pages where the contents of the page are static.\n\nThese were originally written for Math.se users to get MathJax rendering in their chatroom within SE spending development time adding it to chat, but I see no reason why it wouldn’t work on an arbitrary webpage (and indeed, it seems to work like that on the installation page).\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's not plugin of Tex rendering for Safari. Only for Google Chrome and for Firefox Mozilla. There's GmailTeX, a plugin for Gmail in Chrome. If you want to have it for Safari, you need to contact the author of that plugin and persuade him to build it for Safari. \n", "Q: Is it okay to install a second RAM chip? I have a 2010 MacBook Pro with a recently replaced logic board and SSD upgrade. I haven't yet upgraded the RAM. \nCurrently, RAM is 4GB, one slot, Apple RAM (whichever manufacturer they use). I am thinking of buying some Crucial RAM to bump it to 8GB. Would it be better if I did 2x4GB from Crucial and put them both in the slots available, or could I get just one Crucial 4GB RAM chip and install it in the empty slot? Would there be any advantages/disadvantages to either?\n\nA: Crucial RAM will almost certainly work with the existing. \nTheir configurator is pretty good at getting exactly the right RAM for the machine.\n\nA: If I understand correctly your question is about whether having matched RAM modules is important. Matched RAM modules allow the motherboard to use the modules in dual channel mode, making more bandwidth available. But as far as I know for most applications it is better to have more RAM in single channel than less RAM in dual channel. \nIf you are going for a non-matching module, try to buy a new module with the exact same specification as the original one (same speed, same parity, same clock, same cycle time). Usually with a good look at the original module you can find identifying information that let you deduce these, or even guess the exact model. Buy from a shop with a favorable return policy just to be safe in the rare case that the non-matching modules fail to work together.\nOtherwise, there are specialized vendors (like OWC) that offer trade-in upgrade packages. They will send you a matching pair of RAM modules and will ask you to send your original module back to them.\n", "Q: Stop Firefox from asking me about blocking Flash Lately it seems like there's a new \"critical\" update to Flash every week or so.

At this rate it will take something like 14 days to complete.\nFor comparison, and to make sure the external drive and USB ports were basically happy, I copied a 4GB file over to the external drive manually and it measured at 8.5 GB/min (very fast).\nHas anyone else seen this and/or have any suggestions for troubleshooting?\nMy system:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBookPro, retina, 15-in, late 2013\n\n*2.6GHz i7\n\n*16 GB RAM\n\n*500 GB SSD\n\n*Seagate Backup Plus Slim portable drives, USB 3.0 (1TB and 2TB)\n\n\nA: I have a Macbook air late 2013 on Yosemite with similar specs but I have an Apple time capsule instead and the only thing I have found to improve speed is an ethernet cable. Get a connecter from thunderbolt to ethernet and then use an ethernet cable to connect it to the external drive. I haven't really tested this much but it did work the few times I have. Also, your external drive might be getting old. For me it usually takes about an hour or less to do a 90 GB backup. Also check your other computers or devices because if they are backing up, it will slow it down. Hopefully this helps!\n\nA: I had the same problem. My Backup Speed was extremely low and I thought my external HDD is broken, so I tested it the same way as you did and everything was fine.\nAfter that I formatted the HDD and then everything worked fine after that. Downside of that: You loose your old backups. \n", "Q: iPhone's space problem Looking at my iPhone via iTunes, i see a very questionable amount of \"Other\".\nWhat is it?

Mac I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts, like CMDkey + 1. However, that 1 has to be from my top row numeric keys. If I try using CMDkey plus a number from the NumPad on the right side of my keyboard - this fails. Even though when I plainly type numbers, my NumPad will type the number just like my top row numeric keys.\nWhy does CMD+1 work if using my top row numkeys, but not my right-side NumPad?\n\nA: I'm the kind of person who loves numberpads, but after transitioning to Macbook pro, there's a thing.\nYou see, we all know that Macbooks are made simplistic and adaptable, but it's also similar to Windows keyboard in a way.\nDo you ever use a Ctrl+1 from a numberpad? no. You use it on the number row.\nYou might've saw my mistake here. Normally there is no Ctrl+1 on Windows unless programmed to do so. \nBut imagine it like Ctrl+F1 -  F1 is on the top. So as Macbook keyboards do. But Macs hardly use the F keys unless fn is held. Imagine holding that everytime you need to do an action. Fussy fussy. So they use the numbers in the number row instead of the F keys.\nSo the default and easier way is to use the number row instead of the number pad, so that it acts like the F keys on Windows.  - That's the way of the Apple, easy to use and beautiful looking!\n\nI guess you could program the Mac to use a different shortcut, as mentioned here in Lifehacker or iDownloadblog\n", "Q: iOS 8 Safari in Iphone, appending to autocompleted url In iOS 8 Safari, when it autocompletes a url one begins to type, it would be useful if we could move the cursor to the end of the autocompleted url so we can append more path and file info.\nIs it possible to append an autocompleted URL in Safari for iPhone ?\n\nA: Backspace will return you to the point you were last typing.\nTap/hold will turn the autocomplete into 'real' text you can then edit - but you can't fill from halfway down the potential URL, it becomes a new full text string that you need to work with, as though you'd already typed it all.\nSo, for instance, typing app will turn into apple.com Tap/hold will 'freeze' that allowing you to then complete apple.com by typing /knowledgebase but if you wanted apple.net you would first have to delete the com before continuing.\n", "Q: System fonts don't display in Pages 5.5 As much as I hate the new Pages, I use it because it was a resource all my devices could update/re-upload before Microsoft Office came out on iOS devices.

My mental model of a charger is that you plug it in and electricity fires out of it like a hose whether you like it or not. When I plug in my macbook charger, it often takes a few seconds before the light comes on and the menu bar icon says charging.\n\nA: This is only educated speculation, but I imagine it's related to the amount of switching that has to take place when changing from battery power to being on the mains. The electrical input needs to be registered, the hardware switched from running off battery to a charging state if needed, and time for the kernel to be informed of the state change based on the polling frequency. Then the other power management daemons have to pick up the state change and the OS get the message that the power state has changed. If that polling was taking place at intervals of less than a few seconds, I'd be surprised. \n\nA: The typical process of charging a battery:\nFirst the system detects the power plug.\nNow the Battery status is evaluated and and the battery circuit determines the amount of current to draw. \nIt is not like a hose, it is a calculated current amount. In other words the battery is the boss and only takes what it needs without overheating or damage.\nIf you look at you battery Icon in the menu bar you will see it takes a moment or two to determine how long it will take to charge to 100%.\nOnce that process is completed and the charging is on the way, you are given a visual indication (LED) of activity.\n", "Q: iSpazz 64-bit problem?

Well, yesterday night I closed the lid and the Mac entered sleep mode. The expected behaviour according to Apple is that when I wake up in the morning, the Mac would turn on and load the RAM image from disk back to the main memory, taking many seconds to wake up. Instead, it woke up immediately -like if it never entered hibernation.\n1) Why doesn't my MBP do what Apple claim it should do when \"sleeping\"?\n2) I'd like to have the hibernation mode active. I love that my computer turns on sooo quickly but if I'm not going to use it for many hours, I'd prefer to save battery with a (slightly slower) boot.\nI already tried to change the standbydelay and the autopoweroffdelay to little numbers like 1 minute, 2 minutes, 0 minutes, 120 seconds, 60 seconds (standbydelay uses seconds, autopoweroffdelay minutes according to pmset man). \nI don't have any USB connected, I turned off iCloud and Google sync. \nI saw the pmset -g assertions to see if there's some daemon or app or service preventing the deep sleep. I changed the hibernatemode from 3 to 25, and back to 3.\nAnd yes, I read the pmset man and tried virtually everything I read on the web.\nThe Mac keeps entering sleep but never deep sleep/hibernation.\nI tested everything. I'd like to have more control (or SOME control) over when and how MY computer goes to sleep/hibernate. \n\nA: Since you did not post your pmset -g power profile, we can't be sure if it is set right.\nFirst, autopoweroff specifically says it does not work if on battery power. Sure, that's dumb and contrary to common sense, but that's European power laws.\nThe correct setting is standby:\nFrom 10.10.5's man page:\n\nSTANDBY ARGUMENTS\nstandby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. The setting standby will be visible in pmset -g if the feature is supported on this machine.\nstandby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.\nstandbydelay specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.\n\nOn my Macbook Pro, for some reason, it's:\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1*\nAC Power        -1\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         4200\n standby              0\n halfdim              1\n sms                  1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n disksleep            10\n sleep                10\n hibernatemode        3\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         3\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\nNotice Standby is set to 0. It should be changed to 1 to turn the feature on.\npmset -a standby 1\n\nA: The \"standby\" settings have been changed in MacOS 10.14 \"Mojave\". In addition to standby, there are three more relevant pmset variables:\n standbydelaylow      10800\n standbydelayhigh     86400\n highstandbythreshold 50\n\nThe idea is that the machine should enter hibernation mode faster if the battery charge is low, that's why the standbydelaylow duration is shorter than the standbydelayhigh. The standard settings above indicate that if the battery is more than 50% charged (i.e. above the highstandbythreshold), then the machine will hibernate after 24 hours (86400 sec). If the battery is less than 50% charged, then hibernation mode is entered after 3 hours (10800 sec). You may configure these variables as you wish using sudo pmset -a.\nNote that hibernation seems to work only if the disksleep parameter is set to 1. If it is 0, you get a warning when you change the standby variables.\n", "Q: How to approve \"Unapproved caller\" whilst installing the software?

My situation was different, I had trashed the content of hidden var/folders/ after seeing a post that said it was all leftover junk from earlier flash updates.

Nothing adds up.  \n\nA: The (good) old days where you had to manage your RAM usage are history.\nApple OS X does that for you.\nKeeping free RAM is thing of the past. It did not make sense anyway to keep unused RAM.\nThe OS X manages the RAM for maximum efficiency, and speed.\nIn doing so it will load the RAM up to what is needed. \nIf your system appears to be slow, it is usually not the RAM, but some process eating up the CPU.\nYou can look up in the Activity monitor to see what is it.\n", "Q: How do I find out what apps are in iTunes and not on my iPhone, and vice versa?

Obviously fsck is pretty safe to run in single-user mode. I'm using gtypist to learn touch typing and would like to be able to run it in single user mode so that I don't have to load the whole OS just for a command-line app.\nWhen I first try running gtypist I got a segmentation error 11, which \"means that the program accessed a memory location that was not assigned\". On subsequent attempt get \"HOME environment variable not set.\"\nI thought maybe I need to use su to login in as a regular user, but my user account isn't listed in /etc/passwd. Should it be?\nIs it even \"safe\" to run applications in single user mode? If so - would I create a new user? Create an environment variable in the root account? I don't even see HOME listed as a gtypist env variable so maybe it's not a gtypist variable at all.\nOn side note, just learned that rather than reboot into single user mode one can just open terminal and sudo shutdown now, after which OS X will \"quietly and consistently shutdown to single-user mode.\" Sweet.\nEDIT:\nI think this question and the suggestion to use \">console\" may be a more succinct way of addressing and answering my question.\n\nA: The TL;DR: Yes, you can run command line tools in Single User Mode. But not all command line tools. That's not what Single User Mode is meant for.\n\nI don't have to load the whole OS just for a command-line app.\n\nExcept, as you're discovering, you probably do.\nSingle user mode is meant for trouble shooting problems with the computer. It is the bare minimum needed for Darwin, the underlying Free BSD port that OS X is based on top of, to function. What you are placed in is a shell capable of running when things on the hardware are dire. It is a not a fully-functioning shell.\nWhile it's \"safe\" to run applications in Single User Mode, in so much as you can't hurt things by running something like gtypist, it isn't recommended because it isn't an environment meant for running things other than emergency tools.\nYou should consider running a Terminal or iTerm2 window in full screen mode if you'd like a monitor that's 100% terminal and running gtypist from there. You're not gaining anything dropping OS X to single user mode, in fact you're losing a great many things and fighting battles that don't need to be fought.\nYou could use >console login, but if it's simply speed of access you're looking for, the hardware and software are designed to simply be put to sleep between uses, from which awakening is faster than rebooting into SUM anyway.\n", "Q: TestFlight Internal Testers on iOS Individual Developer Program If I sign up for the iOS Individual Developer Program (rather than the Company one), will I be able to set up multiple users within iTunes Connect so that I can have some TestFlight internal beta testers?\n\nA: Sure.

I want to forward all SMS and iMessages received on my iPhone to my e-mail address. I have tried IFTTT, but can't see a way to do it.

If you don’t, the\n  numeric access code will not appear on your iPad or Mac during the\n  setup process. As soon as you enable your email address for iMessage\n  (you only need to do this on your iPhone) the numeric access codes\n  appear as expected. Once you have text message forwarding setup you\n  can disable your email address again in iMessage as it seems to only\n  be necessary for the numeric access code setup step, not the actual\n  text message forwarding itself.`\nTo enable your email in Messages, grab your iPhone and head to\n  Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. There, you’ll find all of the\n  addresses at which you can be reached via iMessage. Enable your iCloud\n  email address by tapping on it, then head back to your Mac or iPad and\n  again request the pairing verification code from the Messages app.\n  This time, you should see a box appear on your iPhone in which you can\n  enter the code.\n\nSource: http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/sms-relay-configuration-fix/\n", "Q: How to find if a second-hand iPhone is stolen after purchase?

It recently had 4 partitions on it. This is what the map looked like.\n\n*\n\n*Backup [OS X, Journaled]: 1.4TB\n\n*Macintosh HD clone [OS X, Journaled]: 0.3 TB\n\n*Yosemite [OS X, Journaled]: 0.5 TB\n\n*Windows Bridge [FAT]: 0.5 TB\n\n\nI had originally downloaded and installed Yosemite on a separate partition to play around with it, and then when I decided I liked it, I copied my Mavericks Mac HD onto another partition of the drive as a backup. I then upgraded my main system to Yosemite.\nLater on, I decided that I no longer needed the Mac HD clone, since Yosemite is pretty stable at this point, so I removed it; I also resized the Yosemite partition down to 300 GB since I wasn't going to write anything else to it.\nThe partition map then looked like this:\n\n*\n\n*Backup: 1.4TB\n\n*Unallocated: 0.3TB\n\n*Yosemite: 0.3TB\n\n*Unallocated: 0.2TB\n\n*Windows Bridge: 0.5TB\n\n\nThat was all fine. However, recently, I installed Windows through Bootcamp on my primary SSD. In Windows' disk management, I tried to remove the Windows Bridge partition and replace it with a 0.7TB NTFS partition. The partition deleted, but the reformat operation failed, so I figured I would boot into OS X, remove the partition, and add a new FAT 0.7 TB partition which could then be reformatted by Windows into NTFS.\nI opened up Disk Utility and saw that the Windows Bridge partition was still there according to OS X. So I went ahead and removed it.\n\nAnd then, bad stuff happened.\nThe windows partition removed successfully, but the Yosemite partition immediately became unrecognizable by OS X. The files are intact, but OS X sees it as disk1s3, and is unable to read, write, or repair the disk.\nThe strangest part of it all is that Windows can still read the drive. If I boot into Windows, I can copy anything from the partition, and it works just fine, but boot back into OS X, and the partition is unreadable.\n\nThings I've tried\n1. TestDisk and PDisk\nI have tried to create my own partition map for the drive using TestDisk to find the partitions and PDisks to create the new partition. TestDisk shows some weird configurations. It appears as though there are two partitions, masquerading as MS Data, assigned to the same set of blocks, with the name Yosemite. That must be causing the problem:\n\nPDisk will not let me open the disk to be rewritten.\n\npdisk: can't open file '/dev/rdisk1' for writing (Resource busy)\n\n2. Copying all of the files and re-formatting.\nSince Windows can read the disk, I figured, why not copy everything from the Yosemite partition onto the Windows ST partition and reformat the broken partition. The only problem with that is that Windows limits path names to 255 bytes, and in OS X, a lot of the files have filenames that are much longer than that. I need all of the files on the drive in order to keep it bootable, so skipping those files that would not copy is out of the question.\n\nSo:\nDo any of you fine people have any ideas as to how I can fix this partition map and/or get all of my data off of that partition so I can reformat it?\nI can definitely go pick up another 3 TB drive to use to copy all of the files off of the existing drive so that the drive can be completely reformatted if you know of a way that I can get all of the files off of the Yosemite partition.\n\nEdit:\n> diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            200.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                50.1 GB    disk0s4\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Worth Backup            1.9 TB     disk1s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data                         300.0 GB   disk1s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data WINDOWS ST              510.0 GB   disk1s4\n\n\n> diskutil cs list\n\n    No CoreStorage volume groups found\n\n\n> sudo gpt -r -vvv show -l /dev/disk0\n\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=251000193024;

The first is MBR, which has been around since the 1980’s. The second is GPT, which is fairly new. The third is a hybrid scheme which combines the first two. OS X’s Disk Utility application allows you to select either MBR or GPT. If MBR is selected, then you get the traditional MBR scheme. On the other hand, if you select GPT, you will get either the GPT or the hybrid MBR/GPT scheme. Normally, the GPT scheme is used, but if one or more partitions have a MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT format then the MBR/GPT scheme is employed. If an external drive is hybrid, Windows will see the drive as MBR. If Windows is used to change the partitioning on such as drive, the results are unpredictable. This is why Apple recommends only using MBR to partition an external drive to be used by both OS X and Windows.\nI believe your external drive was partitioned as an hybrid drive. The output you posted from the gpt command shows both GPT and MBR partitions. \nTo review, here is the output you posted from the command sudo fdisk /dev/disk1. It is the content of the MBR table.\nDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 45600/255/63 [732566645 sectors]\nSector size: 4096 bytes\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -      76805] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [     76806 -  461468854] HFS+        \n 3: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 534820616 -   73242187] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 4: 0C 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 608062976 -  124503552] Win95 FAT32L\n\nWe want to remove partition 3 (Yosemite) from the table.

Then I transfer it over to the device with iTunes.\n\nA: The only means that I know of, is to jailbreak your iPhone. you would need use applications available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, such as Evasi0n. The first and most important thing to do is to make a complete backup of your phone in iTunes. Secondly, you must download Evasi0n for your platform of choice, open the application, and plug your device in via USB. When the program has successfully completed, you should find a new app on your iPhone called Cydia. From here you can download the tweak YourTube. this app is an extension of YouTube that allows you to download any video for free.\n", "Q: Applescript and Shell: how do I insert a variable?

It's the code that completes the above for turning on a bulb:\ndo shell script \"curl --request PUT --data \" & TurnOnBulbA & \" http://myIPaddress/api/myhueID/lights/1/state/\"\n\n\nA: You're embedding RandomNumA inside a literal (double-quoted) string, so it's treated as part of the literal rather than as a variable reference. To get it interpreted as a variable, you have to do the same thing you do in the do shell script command at the end -- use & to append a quoted literal, a variable reference, and another quoted literal. Actually, it's slightly more complicated because you have to use parentheses to make sure the whole thing gets quoted form of applied to it:\nset RandomNumA to (random number from 0 to 65535)\n\nset TurnOnBulbA to the quoted form of (\"{\\\"on\\\": true,\\\"hue\\\": \" & RandomNumA & \", \\\"sat\\\": 240,\\\"bri\\\": 90}\")\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2010 with Maverick restarting I have read tones of advice on this and I still have no solution and just wanted some personal advice.\nMy macbook pro mid 2010 keeps restarting randomly, not always on the same program.\nIt works fine in safe mode.\nI just wondered if anyone had any advice on how to stop this happening, I've tried uni stalling certain programs, deleting files, everything I can think of. \nPlease can some help me :(\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: My one experience years ago with this was 15\" Powerbook ... but Apple Support told me that was a sign the motherboard was going, and they replaced it (on Applecare)\n\nA: In my case it was fault NVIDIA GPU (MacBook Pro mid-2010 15-inch).

You have to add on a couple more steps, but luckily it’s fairly easy.\nBefore you do anything, make sure to back up your iOS device because this method will wipe your iPhone or iPad clean. Luckily, we have a handy guide on how to do just that.\nFirst off, visit this website and download the iOS 8.1.2 IPSW for your specific iOS device. These files range between 1.5 GB and 2GB for iPhones and iPads, so be aware that it may take a bit of time to download it.\nOnce you have the file downloaded, plug your iOS device into your computer and open up iTunes. Go to your device’s summary page and hold down the Option/Alt key on your keyboard or Shift if you’re on Windows. Keep holding down the key as you click on Restore in iTunes.\nNext, browse to find the IPSW file that you downloaded and open it. iTunes will begin restoring your iPhone and will install iOS 8.1.2.\nAfter the process is complete, your iOS device should now be running iOS 8.1.2. From there, you’ll want to restore your backup by going to the device summary page in iTunes and clicking on Restore Backup. Give it time to restore all of your apps and settings, and eventually you’ll be back to running iOS 8.1.2 just like you were before updating to iOS 8.1.3.\nWord for word from: http://www.gottabemobile.com/2015/01/27/how-to-install-ios-8-1-3-update/\n", "Q: How to fix an iPhone stuck on \"Connect to iTunes\" screen after iOS8 update?

I'm dyslexic and I have Asperger's. I need the iPhone to communicate with people because I have speech problems.\n\nA: Your device seems to be in Recovery Mode (or DFU Mode but that's hardly the case unless you were jailbreaking). If the firmware update was successful, you might get out of Recovery Mode by simply rebooting the iPhone. iPhone in Recovery mode should also reboot by itself after 15 minutes.\nA manual reboot is done the usual way, by holding down the Sleep button and swiping the 'Slide to power off' slider when it appears. After iPhone has shut down, start it by pressing the Sleep button.\nIf the iPhone stays it the Recovery Mode after the reboot, it must be restored with iTunes. You only option is to find a computer with iTunes and restore the firmware when connected to iTunes. You will lose all non-backed up changes on the iPhone when restoring! After restoring a functional iOS, you can restore the latest backup of your iPhone.\nThere are also various pieces of software (i.e. TinyUmbrella) that have the means of getting an iPhone out of the Recovery Mode, if the iOS is otherwise functional. However, I'm not aware of such programs available on a Chromebook.\nWhen you get to a computer with iTunes, there's an Apple's support article listing the steps to resolve most iOS update and restore errors with iTunes.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Update iTunes\n  \n*Update the OS X\n  \n*Update, disable or remove your computer’s security software\n  \n*Unplug extra USB devices\n  \n*Restart\n  \n*Try again\n  \n\n", "Q: Is there any way to re-enable the “old style” iTunes metadata editing window in version 12.1.0.50? Short Question: Versions of iTunes 12 previously allowed users to use the “old style” iTunes metadata editing window layout when clicking alt/option and selecting “Get Info…”. That has seemingly disappeared with a recent update to iTunes 12; specifically version 12.1.0.50. Is there any way to re-enable the “old style” metadata editing window in this new version of iTunes 12.1.0.50.\nLong Question: So, when iTunes 12 was released the interface was changed a bit; which is expected. But unlike older releases, it included a change to the metadata editing window which made it more compact and altered the user experience.\nSome of us still like the “old style” editing window layout and the user experience connected to it. Heck the “old style” window has been like that for years. But prior to iTunes 12.1.0.50—and still using iTunes 12—one could access the “old style” metadata editing window by doing a “Get Info…” on media while holding down the alt/option. This blog post explains the simple trick nicely and below is a screenshot of the “old style” metadata editing window for reference.\nNow with iTunes 12.1.0.50 it seems that this somewhat hidden—yet easy to access—functionality is gone. Unless I am missing something? Does anyone know how to reenable the “old style” metadata editing window in iTunes 12.1.0.50? Or is it simply gone and ripped from the core code forever?\n\n\nA: No, it has been completely removed. \n\nA: It's still there.\nPress Opt while right-clicking on the track and selecting Get info.\n", "Q: The camera lens on iPod touch 5th gen My iPhone 6 camera protrudes slightly and so does my iPod touch 5th gen, but I don't worry about scratching my iPhone camera because I know it's coated in sapphire. Is the iPod touch protruding camera also sapphire? Or is it just the same glass as the screen?\n\nA: The iPod touch 5 is older then the iPhone 6 (released with the iPhone 5) so no, it does not have a sapphire coating. However, it generally is durable enough for most things before it scratches. \n", "Q: Why doesn't giving kids more time work? So my child ran out of their alloted time on the computer today, so I went and gave them 4 more hours.  This is the parental controls where you select how much time to add, and you add your own (administrator) user name and password.\nHowever, a couple hours later I was surprised to see that my child had logged out, because it had told them they were out of time.   But then somehow even though they had logged out, the main login window still showed them logged in, so I reboot the computer.\nHowever this evening I was going to give them 15 minutes of time to print something, but after I enter my credentials, it no sooner has logged them in, then the window does the 3 dimensional \"user switching\" by itself, and now they are at the login window, and it is telling them they can log in again tomorrow.  I try to add 15 minutes again, and it does the same thing.  So I try 30 minutes, and they are logged in for about a minute and it logs them out again.\nWhy can't I give my kid more time on the computer?  They weren't trying to login during bedtime hours, they had only exceeded their weekend limit of 2 hours.\n\nA: It does the same for me, too, sometimes. Generally it solves itself. If it does not, try giving them the rest of the day and see if that logs them out.\nAlso, rebooting will log them out, for sure.\n", "Q: Access iPhone through emulation My friend's iPhone just faded out today. The screen is just white when she turns it on. The apple store told her she is going to lose everything... this is stupid because I'm 100% positive a hard drive failure has not occurred. Alarms are still going off. Reminders work. Notifications are being received. We know this because each has it's own respective sound that is getting sporadically emitted.\nWhen I hook the iPhone up to her computer to backup it's contents, it wants us to enter the phone's password. We are not able to simply enter the password into the blank white screen. The phone doesn't registered this touch input. Moreover, we've tried holding down every combination of buttons imaginable to make the screen responsible again to no avail. So I'm inclined to say that the screen completely failed.\nSo here's my question. Is there a way from the computer that I can mimic touch input on the iPhone to input the password to initiate the backup process? Is there another way to access the phone's file system recover it’s contents? The phone has been rooted, so it needs to be a legit strategy. The last iCloud backup was too long ago, in case anyone asks.\nThank you for any help,\nNick\n\nA: You can use VoiceOver to control the device from a USB keyboard. You can usually use a keyboard to enter the passcode, but you also need to press Trust from a keyboard, which you can't do while connected to a computer that is not already trusted. In essence, either\n\n\n*\n\n*enter the passcode with a USB keyboard and connect the device to a trusted computer, or\n\n*use VoiceOver to control the device from a USB keyboard to perform a backup to iCloud, steps for which are provided at https://deciphertools.com/blog/iphone-passcode-broken-screen/.\n\n", "Q: Dock Icon Show Desktop Is it possible to create a dock icon that shows the desktop?\nIdeally I'm looking for 10.5.6 support and up.\n\nA: You could create an AppleScript to minimise all windows and then pin it in your dock.

If not, go to step 2.\nFrom your browser, type in a fixed IP address. You can use http://18.62.0.96/ (which points to the website http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) as the URL.* If this works correctly, bookmark the page, and try accessing the page from the bookmark. If these tests work (but step 1 fails), then there is a problem with your DNS configuration; check the steps above to make sure you have configured everything correctly. If these tests do not work, go to step 3.\nRoll back the DNS changes you made and run the tests again. If the tests still do not work, then there is a problem with your network settings; contact your ISP or network administrator for assistance.\n\nPossible limitations:\nRouters\nEvery router uses a different user interface for configuring DNS server settings; we provide only a generic procedure below. For more information, please consult your router documentation.\nNote: Some ISPs hard-code their DNS servers into the equipment they provide; if you are using such a device, you will not be able to configure it to use Google Public DNS.

I have Safari set to open a blank page when I open a new tab. I like it better than what it is normally set to, but unfortunately I work late a lot and the giant white area on the screen bothers my eyes a considerable deal. Does anybody know a way to make the blank page darker so that it's easier on the eyes?\nJust for reference, here's the blank page I'm talking about: http://cl.ly/image/1l1P47351D1o\n\nA: There may be other ways to do this, but a simple way would be to create your own homepage, which could look anyway you like. Then, just set the Homepage in Safari to point at that file.\nMake a file called \"home.html\" with these contents:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html style=\"background:#333;\">\n<head>\n    <title>New Tab</title>\n</head>\n</html>\n\nOpen that file with Safari, and use the preferences dialog to set the homepage to the current page. Also set new tabs and windows to start on your homepage.\n\nA: Extending on the answer provided earlier, you can make a simple html file, and save it in your home directory or somewhere, and then set up your General Safari preferences like this:\n\nThen when Safari starts up, or you open a new tab it'll be the nice darker empty page:\n\n\nA: The previous solutions for the blank dark page do not auto-focus on the address bar, one solution is to set a custom safari stylesheet and change body color to dark.\nCreate darkblanksafari.css as below:\n@media screen,projection,tv { \n       body {\n       background-color: #1c1c1c;\n       }\n}\n\nNow set Style Sheet to the file through Advanced tab in Safari Preferences:\n\nIt leads to less eye strain and less glaring white pages in your late nights while keeping your internet experience intact, because most websites replace body background color with their own.\n\nA: The previously noted solutions of the dark page is great, but they lack the ability to have the address bar auto-focused, which to me is a non-starter.  I'm used to being able to immediately start typing a URL or a search item right off the bat when I open a new page / tab.  This is such a good feature that I went ahead and submitted a request for Apple to add this feature, but I think in the meantime there may be a clunky workaround.\nWhile I did not find any blank page html or css floating around the Safari.app bundle unfortunately, I realized that we could use a macro app like SimpleKeys, Keyboard Maestro, or another such app to create a double whammy where we could set the default blank page as noted previously, ie:\nEdit ~/Library/Safari/DarkBlank.html (and set your blank page to this):\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html style=\"background:#333;\">\n<head>\n    <title>New Tab</title>\n</head>\n</html>\n\nAnd then set a macro to initiate a (command-t,command-l) or (command-n,command-l) in order to create a new tab or window with the address bar in focus.  You'd have to get used to a new shortcut to do this, but you'd get the expected behavior.\nAt any rate, I hope that there is ultimately a better solution put in place by Apple themselves, but if you want address bar focus, this is probably the best we can hope for at the moment unless someone is aware of another way to hack the page (perhaps via NinjaKit or EasySIMBL).\n\nA: This is not a direct solution to creating a dark page open for a new tab. However, I have similar issues with working late and straining my eyes to read glaring white pages. I personally use Flux and it solves the issue for me system-wide.\nhttps://justgetflux.com/\nThe default settings are a bit extreme for me, but you can edit them to your preferences and set a schedule for when you'd  like it turned on. Took almost 2-3 weeks for me to get used to it but now I'm hooked. Hope it helps.\n\nA: Update: this is not a good answer, it has significant downsides.\n--\nIt's possible, but solution is not perfect.\nCreate new service for Safari using Automator using following AppleScript (last line is optional - it's the Del key)\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell window 1 to set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:\"data:text/html;base64,PGJvZHkgYmdjb2xvcj1ibGFjaz4K\"})\ndelay 0.3\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Safari\" to keystroke \"l\" using command down\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Safari\" to keystroke (ASCII character 8)\nreturn input\n\nName it, assign ⌘T in preferences.\nThe big downside is that it is rather slow (~1 second before I can start typing). I blame Automator. Maybe binary service doing the same thing will perform better.\nSecond problem - it blinks white for a short moment. Setting homepage to static black page blinks white too.\n\nA: As mentioned before, when you set a .html page as the page to load on new tabs, it wont focus on the browser's address bar.\nBut you can create a simple address bar (an input field) on the page itself, where you can enter an URL or search on Google.\n<script>\n    function isValidWebUrl(url) {\n        let regEx = /^https?:\\/\\/(?:www\\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256}\\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&//=]*)$/gm;\n        return regEx.test(url);\n    }\n\n    function visit(){\n        url = document.getElementById('url').value;\n        if( isValidWebUrl(url) ){\n            window.location = url;\n        } else if( isValidWebUrl('https://'+url) ){\n            window.location = 'https://'+url;\n        }else {\n            window.location = 'https://www.google.com/search?&q='+url;\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n<body style=\"background-color: #333;\">\n    <form onsubmit=\"visit(); return false;\">\n        <input id=\"url\" type=\"text\" style=\"width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; font-size:xx-large; display: block; transition: all 1s;\" autofocus>\n    </form>\n</body>\n\n\n", "Q: Error on simple script to open new tab I am trying to run a simple script which simply opens a new tab, but am getting execution error: An error of type -10810 has occurred.

However, it wouldn't power on or charge (no light on the MagSafe adapter).\nI worked out that if I first connect the MagSafe adapter to another Macbook (a 13\" Macbook Pro) and then plug it into the 13\" White Macbook the green light turns on with White Macbook 13\". So it would seem that the White Macbook isn't completing the handshake but the MagSafe adapter works for a while after the handshake is completed on another Mac. This is all 100% reproducible.\nAnyway, the Macbook still wouldn't turn on (and the MagSafe indicator remains green - never orange). So I worked out that if I SMC reset, the Macbook will then proceed to boot. However, when booted it said \"No battery connected\" and the fans remain on high power constantly (i.e. the kind of stuff an SMC reset is supposed to fix).\nIf I turn the computer off it then won't boot again. I have to repeat the procedure i.e. MagSafe handshake with another Mac, then SMC reset and it boots.\nI pulled apart the Macbook detached the MagSafe connector and cleaned some gunk off it. I then replaced the hard-drive with a brand new SSD that has Yosemite installed (instead of Lion). I then gave everywhere else inside and out a clean and reassembled. However, after reassembling the same problem persisted (SMC reset needed before booting).\nAfter several SMC resets and boots, I've now got the Macbook in another state. The power is connected but there is no light at all on the MagSafe. However, the computer boots up. When booted fans are on again, but no power indicator of any sort is in my status bar (no battery, no DC power thunderbolt either). Disconnecting the power instantly turns the Mac off, so clearly it's really running off DC power.\nThe Macbook is running the latest firmware/SMC. When booted up everything actually functions fine aside from the fan - I'm typing on the Mac now.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what could be wrong, tests to diagnose or ideally a solution? I'm reasonably handy with a multimeter so if anyone has some power diagnosis steps then I can follow along easily enough.\nUpdate:\nThe process I was using to get the machine to boot was a bit flakey, however I've now narrowed it down to 100% reproducible sequence.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect power cable.\n\n*Hold the power button on Macbook - Duration is not important, you can move to step 2 in a matter of milliseconds.\n\n*Connect the power cable whilst still holding the power button.\n\n*With the power cable in, keep the power button held for at least 5 seconds.\n\n*Release the power button.\n\n*Press the power button to boot the Macbook.\nNote: Having another Macbook around to plug the cable into is not important - all that seems to do is ensure the MagSafe light comes on, but it boots fine with the light off.\nNow, when booted I have the fan and battery symptoms listed above.\nUpdate 2:\nI took the top off again and shorted the \"SMC RST\" (SMC Reset) pins on the board. This didn't resolve the problem, the behaviour remains the same. However, I've noticed a very faint ticking noise when I first connect the MagSafe cable to Macbook. It's very quite but there are exactly 8 ticks evenly spaced over about 2-3 seconds. This is pretty odd as the only moving part in the whole thing is the fans. Yet I hear this 100% reproducibly when I connect the power cable.\nUpdate 3:\nI'm presently waiting for a new battery I've ordered to arrive. Hopefully the new battery will shed light on the issue, or ideally resolve it!\nUpdate 4:\nBrand new battery has arrived. When I insert the battery and try boot, the machine will not boot. My usual boot process (outlined above) does not work with the battery present, I can not power on at all. The Magsafe connector's light remains off.\nThe machine continues to boot post SMC following the procedure above when the battery is not present. If I then insert the battery after the machine has booted, the laptop stays on. However, OS X thinks no battery is there. If I remove the power cord the laptop continues to \"function\" (i.e. full-speed fans) using the battery. However, there is no indication that the battery is being used in OS X, and when the cable is inserted there is no indication that it is charging (the Magsafe light remains off).\n\nA: Historically, Macs have been known to have various issues - including not starting up - when the PRAM battery has died. Later MacBooks (including yours AFAIK) use the main battery for PRAM and SMC memory retention rather than having a separate battery for this purpose. Replacing the battery should clear startup and charging issues.\n\nA: Just to make things clear.

This problem manifests itself both on Hackintosh and if to connect external Display to MacBook.\n\nA: The way to \"fix wrong subpixel layout setting on Mac OS\" is using System Preferences, Display, Rotation 180 degrees (from Standard). This makes an external LED display switch from BGR to RGB pixel orientation.\nHowever you also complain your fonts look terrible. Under System Preferences, General, uncheck Use LCD font smoothing when available. Now ALL fonts will look identical in EVERY orientation. If you do not believe me, then make your whole monitor display white and rotate 90, 180, 270. Do the colors change? No. Because if you disable font smoothing then every font is made from WHOLE pixels.\nSo without font smoothing if your fonts still look terrible, then your problem has to do with something else and NOT BGR or RGB pixel orientation.\n\nA: You aren't going to like it but turn it upside down.. Then you will get RGB\n", "Q: Mail app not opening on yosemite I recently upgraded to Yosemite on my Macbook Pro. For a couple of days, my mail app was working. Then suddenly it stopped working. \nI had to force quit the program and since then the app refuses to even open. The beach ball keeps rotating, and it continuously shows app not responding.\nWhat is the solution to this?\n\nA: My problem with Mail on Yosemite has been the same on three different Macs; new iMac with Retina display, new MacBook Pro with Retina display, and older iMac. Same issue. Half the time or more Mail freezes up upon launch, which required a Force Quit. Upon restarting, most of the time Mail would function OK, but occasionally hang again, always with the same error-- Application Not Responding. I've tried every fix on this thread and other website threads to get it fixed with nothing working.\nHere's what I did to fix it.\nI left the Mail Preferences window open to Accounts. That's it. Now, when I restart the Mac or it starts up automatically in the AM, Mail launches as per normal, but with the Preferences window open to Accounts. No problems since. None. Zero.\nI have over a dozen email accounts, all IMAP, ranging from Apple's iCloud to Gmail to standard IMAP accounts, personal and business. Obviously, there's a bug somewhere. I came upon the fix by disabling all email accounts, re-enabling each, one-by-one, then doing a shutdown and startup. About five re-boots in I inadvertently left the Preferences window open to Accounts. No freeze on the next reboot. When I close Preferences, the freeze begins again.\nIt's a cheap fix but it took a long time to get to it. \n\nA: Close Mail, then try moving ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail to your desktop.   You can go to Go on the Finder menu bar, and hold option/alt to reveal the Library option).\nRestart Mail and see if it works properly again.

I need to move all my data from a newer Macbook OS X 10.9.5 to and older one, OS X 10.6.8. I have tried using a thunderbolt cable and tried wirelessly through migration assistant but the computers cannot find one another?  Any thoughts?\n\nA: Migration assistant doesn't like migrating to older systems so here's a quick and dirty way of doing most of what you want...\n\n\n*\n\n*On both machines create a temporary account with admin privileges.\n\n*Start up the older machine in target disk mode and connect your Thunderbolt cable.\n\n*Log into the new temp account on the newer Mac, in Finder navigate to the Users folder and find the Home folder you wish to migrate across to the older Mac.\n\n*Copy your Home folder to the Users folder on the older Mac. You will most likely receive an error that certain items weren't copied, don't worry about this.\n\n*When finished eject the older Mac and restart it normally.\n\n*Log into temp account on older Mac and go to System Preferences>Users & Groups.\n\n*Create a user account (with admin privileges), using exactly the same name and password as the account you just copied over. You will be warned that a user folder with that name already exists, just continue on.\n\n*You will probably run into disk permission issues with your home folder, an easy fix is to download and run Onyx which will allow you to reset your home folder permissions (Disk Utility just checks system files and Apple apps).\n\n\nHopefully at this point you will be able to log into your user account and access your data, but you will have to copy over any applications over manually.\nAnother way would be to clone the Users folder using Carbon Copy Cloner, then follow step 7 above. The end result should be the same. I wouldn't copy the whole Applications folder over as there will be many version mismatches with the Apple software - just copy over the software you've installed where possible.\nAs I said at the start it's a Q&D method but really there's no easy \"official\" way to migrate to an older system.\n\nA: The older MacBook Pro has to have a thunderbolt port, I bet your issue there is the fact that you're transferring from a newer Mac (with a newer operating system) to an older one which has an older version of migration assistant, thats certainly not going to work. \nYour best bet is to copy the files manually using an external hard drive, like copying Documents, Downloads etc. I would avoid copying the library from a newer OS to an older OS. \n", "Q: Terminal: how to make tab notify somehow when new text received I'm familiar with some Terminal's, like in Linux, that have an option to \"flash\" or \"change color\" the tab's title text, whenever new text is \"displayed\" on that screen (for instance, tailing a file).  iTerm can do it in OS X as well splendidly, changing the font color, etc.  Is there a way to do that with the built-in mac Terminal application?

In \"Appearance\", it has the option to \"color tab labels on activity\" which will make the title red. Not sure if it's even on by default.\n", "Q: Wired memory in activity monitor Activity monitor shows me that I have 11Gb wired but only 5Gb used for 2 processes (others are neglible). Where are other 6GB? When I try to start new virtual machine with 500M RAM it says that I do not have enough so looks like this memory is indeed used.\nUpdate: It turned out that Parallels was using 12Gb for windows by default. Still I don't know where to look for actual memory usage.\n\n\n\nA: Difficult to find any hard and fast sources here but I think the problem you are seeing is because you are running two hypervisors at the same time.\nThere are various places online where you can find people discussing problems when people try to run various combinations of Parallels, Fusion and VirtualBox at the same time.\nI thought this post from one of the VirtualBox developers was particularly interesting:\n\nVT-x [the virtualisation tech inside Intel processors] is designed such that there can only be one entity using it at a time. That's why you can't use VT-x when it's already in use by, say, Hyper-V (and why Type 1 hypervisors suck :P ).\nOne relatively minor difference with OS X is that it's currently the only OS which has APIs to enable and disable VT-x. Windows/Linux/Solaris just don't care and everything is up to the hypervisor. But that is really a minor difference.\nThe short story is that VT-x is not designed to be shared (that's meant to be a security feature). Because operating systems typically do not offer VT-x management APIs, one and only one hypervisor \"owns\" VT-x on a given logical processor at any moment. The way to \"share\" VT-x is to initialize and un-initialize VT-x (aka enter/leave VMX root mode) around every execution of guest code. Hypervisor A comes in, enables VT-x, runs guest code, disables VT-x. Hypervisor B does the same. If both/all hypervisors do this, VT-x can be \"shared\".\n\nSo my guess is that the two hypervisors are trying to share the virtualisation features of the Intel chip in your machine, but one (or both) of them has caused the system to loss track of the resources on your machine.\nI'd try closing one and then the other to see if the memory figures return to something normal. If closing both doesn't help, I'd reboot and start again.\n", "Q: Tool to transform text to all caps or lowercase Is there a system-wide text manipulation app that enables you to select text and convert all letters to upper case or lower case, like a code text editor would?\n\nA: You can set this up as a right click service in automator as @Matthieu Riegler suggested.\nOpen up Automator.app and create a “Service” with this workflow.\n\nPay close attention to the checkbox up top, “Output replaces selected test”.  After the workflow is in place and saved, navigate to “System Preferences-->Keyboard.”  On the left hand side select “Services”.  On the right hand side you will see the Service you created, in the example its saved as “UpperCase”.  Then give it a shortcut by pressing “Add Shortcut” and give it what you would like.  Tested in TestWrangler and TextEdit.\nScript used in Automator:\non run {input, parameters}\nset upperCaseString to ¬\n    (do shell script (\"echo \" & input & \" | tr a-z A-Z;\"))\nreturn upperCaseString\nend run\n\n\nA: I am on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and for all editable text I can select and right click the text and choose Transformations -> Make Upper Case.\n\nHowever, it seems this does not work in all applications. TextWrangler for example does not show this menu. All system applications (Finder, TextEdit, Mail, Calendar, etc...) do.\n\nA: Another tool that I use is PopClip\nThe application can transform selected text to UPPERCASE or even Proper Case or lowercase.  There are several settings for search and other context relevant actions.\nI am not affiliated with the developer.\n\n\nThis is a sample based editing this answer...\n\n\n\nA: I had the same struggle so I create a one button app that solves this problem. It looks like this:\n\nYou'll find the Lowly app here :) \n\nA: WordService will solve your problem. It's a free app from Devon Technologies that provides system-wide Services that do various text manipulations, including changing case.\n", "Q: Mac trying to play audio through monitor's thunderbolt port I have a Dell monitor connected through a thunderbolt port.\nSometimes my Mac for some reason is attempting to play audio through that port.  How do I stop this from happening?\nIt appears in my list of sound outputs in system preferences but I have headphones selected.  Unplugging the monitor from the thunderbolt port makes the audio work correctly.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me. You have to manually change it in System Preferences > Sound > Output Volume.\n\nA: Alt-click the audio item in the menu bar and select the proper source.\n", "Q: Retrieve Memos off ipod I have recorded a memo and while I was recording it. The iPod died. When I turned it on it show I taped something by show 0 minutes. I try to share and it says file is 2.7mb but won't let me share and I can't hear it. How do I retrieve this? \n\nA: I'm not 100% on this but I think you can use something like this software called iBrowse that will allow you to view files from your Mac or PC. Assuming the recording is not somewhere in the restricted portion of the file structure, you can get it from there. The file should be .AAC format. \nAnother way, again assuming you have access to where it was saved, is to use disk mode to browse the files. Apple has a nice support page on that so I won't elaborate: Disk Mode\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Copying printer preset .plist files (Mavericks) I am trying to copy a custom print preset from one computer to another.  My understanding is that the presets are stored in ~/Library/Preferences with the name com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.<name>.plist.  I have copied the preset into my preferences folder, yet the presets for that printer (a Canon ImageRunner 5075) have not changed.\nIn my preferences folder there is only the new file, and when I inspect it with the Property List Editor, the correct presets seem to be there, but when I choose Print, they don't appear in the Print dialog for that printer; instead the previous presets still show up.  Are the preferences cached somewhere?\n(The purely obvious answer \"Just make a new preset\" won't work for me, since Canon, in its infinite wisdom has removed print dialog access to the functionality encoded in the old preset, even though the printer is still able to use it.)\nAny suggestions on how to get this working are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It turns out that preferences are cached in Mavericks (and presumably Yosemite), and therefore copying preference files will not make them immediately available.\nA generic cache cleaning tool such as Onyx can be used to clear the caches or if you're happy using the command line the following command will reload the cached preferences:\nkillall -u <yourusername> cfprefsd \n\nThanks to the MacOS Hints Forums for this useful gem.\n", "Q: Is it a bad idea to compile Samba from source for Mac? We have a Linux NAS and we’re doing some basic Samba sharing. Windows machines are quick and peppy to connect with the device, as are the Linux VMs I’m running on my Mac.\nThe SMB stack Apple has made is notoriously slow. It freezes, stalls, crashes finder. It’s my single biggest issue with my Mac.\nI have experience with Linux/Open Source but I’m far from a pro sysadmin. Have any of you compiled and installed Samba from source? I would like to know if it is a good idea to try or if this will just end up with me reinstalling from a backup.\nIs the performance better? Could you find good support online? Can you share these resources with me?\n\nA: Honestly, it’s a mixed bag. I worked for a client in an enterprise environment—300+ users—with mixed Windows and Mac OS X clients and the SMB/CIFS issues were maddening to say the least. The only “solution” to some specific file sharing issues we could practically implement was to deploy Synology rack-mounted NAS enclosures and use those in lieu of core Windows server-based file sharing since those Linux-based devices handled SMB and AFP connections on Mac and Windows clients beautifully; never an issue.\nBut I left before any real solution was implemented for the core Windows server-based issues they faced. One idea we seriously looked into was upgrading the default install of Samba on the Mac OS X client side via SMBUp. As the developer’s page states:\n\nDid you lose your shared folders with the update of Mac OS X from Snow\n  Leopard to Lion? You can’t see your shared folders from your DVR or\n  Mediacenter box hooked in your TV? The internet tells you to install\n  gigabytes of developer tools and use tons of command-line instructions\n  to regain the ability to see your mac from your other devices in the\n  house after moving to Lion or Mountain Lion? We might be able to help.\nSMBUp (current version: 1.4.1) re-instates Samba as a service of your\n  mac and provides a simple interface to manage the service. Compatible\n  with OS X Lion and above.\n\nThat said, I still see a “fix” like this as a “caveat emptor” endeavor. Apple really mucks around with Samba with each new Mac OS X install. So who knows what will happen if you—for example—install SMBUp and then run an Apple update that somehow conflicts with it. I’d honestly be walking on eggshells with each new Mac OS X upgrade/patch if I went down this path.\nThat said, the nice thing about SMBUp is that the developer is clearly devoted to providing simple/non-sysadmin level advice in the usage of this package to help people going nuts of SMB issues in Mac OS X. In fact, as the developer explains here on a “Mac OS X Hints” page on installing SMB support from source:\n\nI made SMBUp to help people avoid having to install XCode and\n  MacPorts, both of which I love but which are overkill for something\n  like this. I kept waiting for someone to come up with a simple\n  installer for Samba binaries (my money was on Liyanage, who'd made\n  similar things in the past) but after a year I just gave up and made\n  SMBUp.\n\nSo you could do worse if you attempt to do this yourself; at least this developer is doing the “heavy lifting” for you in this case. But like I said, I would still be wary of interactions with core Mac OS X functionality with each Mac OS X upgrade/update. Thus is the reality of Apple’s odd devotion to pushing everything into “the cloud”; basic functionality like file sharing is not seen as a priority anymore.\n", "Q: Use shell wildcard OR with diskutil I have the following terminal command, which matches volumes called A001R45R, A123R45R, etc.\ndiskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/*R45R\n\nBut I also want it to match volumes called B001R4G5, B150R4G5, etc.  How can I use the OR expression in the wildcard?  I tried the following, but it doesn't work:\n$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/{*R45R,*R4G5}\nThe third parameter does not appear to be \"bootable\" or \"nonbootable\"\n$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/\"{*R45R,*R4G5}\"\nUnable to find disk for /Volumes/{*R45R,*R4G5}\n\nI'm using bash.\n\nA: I figured out the answer myself.  Apparently the bash version in OS X supports square brackets, but not curly brackets.  Weird.  It's bash 3.2.53.  This command works:\ndiskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/*[R45R,R4G5]\n\nHowever, in this particular case, it's actually better to use a more specific command like this:\ndiskutil eraseVolume HFS+ FreshMag /Volumes/[A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9][R,L]???\n\nIt should be noted that if more than one volume matches this wildcard, the command will fail, because the wildcard expands to both filenames.\n", "Q: Outlook quick-steps functionality on Mac In Outlook 2010 on Windows, I use the quick steps functionality a lot to automatically sort incoming messages to different folders. The good thing is it applies these rules on subsequent messages as well. For example - if I don't want to be part of a conversation, I create a rule called \"Mute\" which will move that message to a folder called \"Muted\" and Mark as Read. All future messages with the same subject line automatically get moved to the Muted folder. I have several such folders like Follow-up, Hold, Archive etc. All new messages automatically flow to those folders. It helps me keep everything organized.\nI had to move to using a Mac and I'm sorely missing this feature in Outlook 2011 for Mac. Is there ANY app out there (free or paid) that mimics the quick-step feature on Mac with support for Exchange?\n\nA: Not in Outlook, the 2011 outlook is a lousy rewrite of Entourage and 2015 Outlook X is just a new UI looking like 2013. \nIf you want similar functionality you need to use Apple Mail and plug-ins like MailHub. Please know that Mailhub is a for pay plug-in, but you can test drive it. Personally I have completely given up on Microsoft at this point in time as there are so many missing functions in their Outlook, from accepting a proposed time change in calendar, no ability for Quick-Step, even worse no rule (they track the reply and link it, so you might figure I can pick that up and write rule that moves e-mails after reply as an example) NO not Microsoft. \nAs I said Mailhub and a couple of plug-ins make life better. \n", "Q: iMessage - Why is someone prompted to pick one of my connected iMessage contact points?

Then connect your iPad and open iTunes. Select your iPad in iTunes then select the Books tab and make sure Sync Books is ticked and All Books selected. Then sync your device.

It was running Yosemite, but I wanted to do a fresh install, as initially I didn't have the password.\nI created a 2nd partition and installed a clean Yosemite on to it. I then wished to use that partition, so I \"erased\" the original partition in Disk Utility, so that it would let me erase it. \nOnce I did that, the \"-\" button was selectable, but it will not actually delete the original partition, or modify the 2nd one at all.\nI believe part of this is due to the the fact that the startup disc partition is on bottom and not on top, therefore I wouldn't be able to drag the partition to expand it to the max capacity of my computer. \nThat's all i'm trying to do. I realize that what I did was actually the long way (and pointless) to the results i'm trying to get. But how can I do this? I'm not worried about losing any info, as to me this comp is brand new. However, I don't have a USB stick with more than 8g, so I can't create a bootable disc for Yosemite, and pretty much need to install from app store download.\n\nA: If the machine still boots, go to the App store and \"purchase\" Yosemite (its free).  Now boot the machine holding COMMAND R and boot to internet recovery.  If you see a poorly animated spinning globe instead of an Apple logo then you are on the right track.  Now you have can reformat the whole drive and do a clean install of Yosemite.\n\nA: As for the Yosemite bootable disk, it should be possible to make one from the Yosemite installer app - Be sure that you have downloaded it, not installed it. I think 8Gb should be enough actually.\nFor the stubborn Partition, I like to use Linux for this. Any Linux Distro should be suitable, because it has GParted most of the time. Format the stubborn partition to another format, such as FAT32.\nIf you only have one usb, Make the Bootable Yosemite installer and create an iso from the usb, then download YUMI and a Linux Distro. Use YUMI to create a multi-boot USB with Linux for partition editing and Yosemite installer to install Yosemite.\n", "Q: Is there a notification if someone is using Remote Management to observe my screen?

Now before trying it out I wanted to ask here if this method is advisable or if there is any other way of fixing my problem.\n\nA: Disk Utility doesn't check permissions for user home folders. To do this on systems later than 10.6 you will need to boot into recovery mode (or boot from a USB installer) and go to Utilities > Terminal, then type resetpassword. Here you will find the option to reset permissions for a specific user's home folder.\nAlternatively you can reset home folder permissions with Onyx, free from Titanium Software.\n", "Q: iOS8.1.3 will not update I have the iphone 6 and it will not update past the current OS 8.1.3\nThe process gets as far as the terms and conditions screen and will not go any further. \n\n\n*\n\n*Have tried turning the phone off and on but still the same. \n\n*Have also done the two button reset but still no joy.\n\n\nA: The next solution to try might be to backup/restore your iPhone.\nThe Apple Store can help you with this, but probably not free of charge unless your iPhone is under warranty.\nFortunately, you can do it yourself, but you'll need to be able to log into iTunes with the same Apple ID that is used to identity you on the iPhone on a computer, and you'll need to be able to connect to that computer using a USB adapter cable.\nIf you can do that, then here's a pretty good description of the process:\nhttp://www.uberphones.com/2011/05/restore-your-iphone-and-keep-homescreen-organized/.\n", "Q: How to mount remote shares that have the same name, and easily differentiate them in the Finder? We have three Linux development servers which are available through SMB/CIFS, and I mount them on my Mac (using an Automator script in my Login Items).\nThe problem is that the SMB shares are username based, so all three shares show up as the same name in the Finder. If one looks carefully in the Volumes folder, then of course they are given different names, but those names are arbitrary, based on the order of successful mounting, I suppose. And anyway, the different names don't show up in the Finder.\nI would like to be able to easily know which one is which - even a colored label would be nice, but I can't seem to be able to edit tags or labels directly on volumes.\nRight now I can do one of these two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open each of the \"username\" volumes, look at the list of folders inside, realize that these are not the projects I'm looking for, move on to the next folder.\n\n*Open the server through the \"Shared\" section in the Finder sidebar. But this attempts to re-connect to the server for some reason. So there is a delay before the volume opens.\n\n\nSo, what can I do to be able to tell which volume came from which server?\n\nA: Although tags cannot be edited directly from the finder for volumes, comments can.\nTherefore, I went into Side bar → Devices → Machine Name (which is where I can see all the volumes. In fact, it shows the /Volumes folder), and did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I added the name of the particular server as a comment to each of the volumes.\n\n*In the finder view options, I added the comment column so that it shows when the folder is in list view, and checked the \"always open in list view\" option.\n\n\nTherefore, now, whenever I open the volumes list I can see the comment and know exactly which share I want to open.\n\nPrevious to discovering this, I discovered that although volume tags cannot be edited from the finder, they can be changed through command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a dummy folder or use some existing folder in your own home folder. Change its tag to whatever you want the volume to have.\n\n*Get info on the volume you want to change, to see its current name. That is, if the share name is your username userX, and you have more than one such share mounted, one will be named userX, the next userX-1, userX-2 and so on. You can find out the name by getting info on the volume and looking at the \"Name and extension\" box.\n\n*Run the following commands from terminal to copy the tags from you dummy folder:\nxattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \"$(xattr -px com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags /Users/userX/dummyFolder )\" /Volumes/userX-N\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"$(xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /Users/userX/dummyFolder )\" /Volumes/userX-N\n\nReplace /Users/userX/dummyFolder with the full path of your dummy folder (you can drag it to the terminal window for that), and /Volumes/userX-N with the name of the volume that you verified above.\nI learned this method from this answer.\nNevertheless I prefer the first method I mentioned, now that I discovered it, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It displays actual textual information rather than a color I have to remember the meaning of (though of course I could go for a text tag rather than a color tag).\n\n*It requires no command-line access, only simple finder operations.\n\n*It doesn't change anything in the volume that isn't supposed to be changed.\n\n\nNote: Both solutions require that you do not remove the .DS_store file on the server.\n", "Q: Can't change color default folders yosemite 10.10.2 I've got a brand new mac with Yosemite 10.10.2\nand I dislike the blue color of the folders\nI'm looking for a proper way to change ALL folders's color\nI've seen that http://yukiyamashina.github.io/blog/2014/10/19/how-to-change-the-color-of-default-folder-icons-in-OS-X-Yosemite/\nBut I can't find the folder CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/\nIs this because I've got Yosemite 10.10.2 ?\n\nA: Try candy Bar, I use it to change my icons and it works all the time. \nIt's no longer supported by it's developers but the current version still works \nhttp://www.panic.com/blog/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/\n", "Q: Very slow to start processes or open applications I have a Mac Mini (Mid 2011, 8GB RAM) with Yosemite which is getting slower and slower.

I have also seen slow app launching due to bad font caches. \nI assume that you have let the system run for a while so that Spotlight can have a chance to update its databases. This can take a while, although on a relatively current Mac with an SSD drive, it should not take more than a few hours. \nIt is also possible that there are other cache's or background cleanup utilities that are not running properly. \nYou can try Onyx. Be sure to download the correct version of Oxny for your version of Mac OS X. Oxny is a GUI wrapper for a wide variety of command line tools to deal with these types of issues. After you run Oxny, you can expect the first startup time to be MUCH slower because various databases, caches and the like need to be rebuilt. There after, it should be back to full speed. \n", "Q: Bought a selection of songs off iTunes, they are \"greyed out\" won't play, can't sync them Hey so I bought a heap of songs off iTunes tonight.

When I run out of memory (free space less than 1 GB) the computer slows down and even hangs up.\nI suspect that this slow down is due to the impossibility of indexing to be written on the disk and due to a lack of space for the virtual memory.\nIs it possible to single out a place to be used only for paging and indexing?

He thought he was installing it with Boot Camp, booting with option held down shows 2 HDs (Windows and EFI Boot) and clicking on either of them just launches XP. So, option doesn't work, R doesn't work, C from the OSX CD doesn't work. It doesn't read the OSX CD from within XP. Apparently he overwrote my Mac OSX HD with XP. (I would love if this is not actually the case, but since neither HD selection launches OSX, it doesn't look good.)\nI want my Mac back! \nI've got a quad core Mac Pro w/ 3 HDs installed, I think it was running 10.6. Onhand I've got install CDs for 10.1 and Snow Leopard (which I had installed and then restored back because of app compatibility issues.)\nIf possible, I'd like to get XP off and restore to OSX. Timeline should have my backup on HD #3 but I can't get the machine to recognize the OSX install CD, let alone run an OSX recovery program. It asks if I want to format the disk. \nDoes it seem like it's possible to somehow boot back into OSX that I'm missing? \nCan I get OSX back without completing wiping the HD? (it probably already is wiped, I guess.)\nHow can I reinstall OSX if I can't get XP to read the OSX install disk? (It doesn't show it as an option to boot from the CD when restarted with Option key held down.)\n\nA: The first thing to do is to eject your CD/DVD and then power down the Mac and then disconnect any drives and accessories other than your keyboard and monitor.\nThen boot the Mac and as soon as you hear the fans start or the chime - hold only the option key down.\nThis should boot to a grey screen that lists any bootable OS that are connected.\nAt this point, see if you can see a Mac partition to boot to. Worst case, if you only see windows, try installing the DVD/CD and boot to disk utility. Don't erase things, just use it to see the partition scheme and report back what it shows. A cell phone picture of the window would be a good start to see what damage if any has been done.\nDon't agree to any prompts to reformat any drives for now. Also, consider paying for AppleCare to walk you through this reinstall or visiting a local genius bar. Sometimes having a thorough back and forth dialog is far better than posting updates to the internet which can take days or weeks to cover what 15 minutes of troubleshooting from a trained pro can accomplish.\nThe best case for you is that the system forgot that it has a Mac partition ready to boot and you can re-\"bless\" that partition and be back in business in 10 minutes. Worst case, you'll end up doing an erase/install per the guide here from Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3910\nOn second thought, that isn't the worst case. Worst case is you have a hardware error and have to triage and fix that before you can follow the steps that normal work to reinstall the OS of your choice. From the details, you certainly have backup media and possibly a data backup so even getting another computer to load your data is an option. You might be able to find a very inexpensive Mac Mini or such to keep running the OS of your choice if you don't want or need to move up to newer hardware.\n\nA: Apologies if you've already assured yourself of this.  \nIn my experience, holding down the various keyboard shortcut keys (particularly the Command-R \"Internet Recovery\" key sequence) works even without bootable volumes attached.

Luckily, third party apps can and do provide more customized interfaces to your contact database.\nI would start with a tool like Interact for setting up a more flexible default contact addition interface as well as extending concepts such as groups and smart parsing of contact details.\nThe time you save with one-tap contact addition and share sheet access to this app will more than make up for the expense and effort needed to have a better tool for contact management than ships with the OS.\n", "Q: iOS 8.1.3 Video Playback I have an iPhone 5s and ever since I updated to iOS 8.1.3 I can't play videos. Online videos, such as YouTube, look like they're playing (the progress bar/timer moves) but it is just a black screen. Videos that I have recorded using the iPhone camera just won't start (the first frame of the video shows up on the screen, but no playback happens). Is anyone else experiencing this? Any ideas on fixing it?\n\nA: Resetting all settings fixed the issue. Still not sure what caused it.\n", "Q: How can I bookmark the left page of a PDF in Preview? In Preview, Command-D will allow you to bookmark the current page of the PDF for later reference.  However, when viewing the PDF in two-up mode (Command-3), it will always bookmark the right-hand page.  How can I bookmark the left-hand page for those times when it's that page precisely that I want to bookmark?\n\nA: I do not know how to do that with Bookmarks, but I use a work around till Apple does something.\nInstead of bookmarks I use Highlights and Notes (alt+cmd+4)\nThen I place a Note on appropriate page (left or right) or anywhere.\nThe advantage is I can make comments in the note.\nExample:\n\n", "Q: Xcode 6.1.1 writes too much data to disk Recently I noticed that Xcode writes too much data to the disc. Within just 40 hours it wrote more than 13GB to the disk. \n\nI restarted Xcode to see what actions cause this insane data transfer. I noticed that typing just one character makes Xcode write 40-50 MB of data onto the disk. As I have an SSD this makes me very \"uncomfortable\" using Xcode. \nHow can I find out where the data is written and why it is written?\n\nA: My guess is that you have a normal Xcode installation and you can confirm this with Instruments or fs_usage\nYou'll want to let it finish downloading any documentation and close project windows that you don't work on to focus on the background file IO.\nsudo fs_usage -w Xcode  | grep -v Terminal\n", "Q: Is there a program that will let me move an item from my Dock to my Menu Bar? And I don't mean like StatusDock, which will move it to the menu bar but also keeps it in the dock. I'd prefer it to just be gone from the Dock. Any way you can do this?\n\nA: Removing the Dock Icon\nThere is a way to remove the icon from the dock; the only problem is that you also lose the menu for the application, which is a slight drawback depending on the purpose of the application itself.\nI, personally have never tried StatusDuck, perhaps when combined with the removal of the dock icon, it could be exactly what you're looking for.\nAs far as removing the dock icon itself, here's the process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the application in the Applications folder (⌘ + click Dock Icon)\n\n*Right-click application\n\n*Click Show Package Contents\n\n*Edit the Info.plist inside the Contents folder\n\n*Modify/Add the LSUIElement key so that the value says YES\nNote: LSUIElement may change to Application is agent (UIElement)\nIf you would like the application to show the dock icon again, modify the value to NO and save the .plist file.\n\n\nIt is worthy to mention that using an application like StatusDuck could help you access the application as a status item. You will just have to test it out.\nStatusDuck:\nhttp://www.statusduck.com\n\nA: If you are wanting a way to change a Dock based app to a Menu Bar app, you are out of luck. But if you are looking for an alternative way to deal with apps focused on the Menu Bar there maybe a solution.\nTake a look at XMenu (Scroll to the bottom of the page.)\nXMenu acts as a launcher for apps, folders, documents, etc. It will allow you to recreate something like the Apple Menu of the Classic Mac OS. \nYou may know the following, but worth restating: \n\n\n*\n\n*Non-running apps in the Dock can be removed by dragging the icon out of the Dock until a \"Remove\" popup appears over the icon. (This is the current behavior in Mac OS X 10.10) \n\n*The Dock preferences allow you to hide the Dock so that it is mostly out of the way. \n\n*Many utility type apps have a preference setting to change them from running in the Dock to the Menu Bar \n\n", "Q: Should the Windows 10 Technical Preview work in BootCamp 5.1 on new Mac Pro (Desktop) Microsoft released the windows 10 technical preview .

Does anyone know if it should work with the version of bootcamp 5.1 on this mac pro? I know i couldnt run windows 7 because the drivers werent written for it.  Apple doesnt specify Bootcamp and windows 10\n\nA: Yes, Windows 10 works fine in Boot Camp, but the Boot Camp Support Software doesn't really launch correctly. In compatibility mode, it seems to work but I haven't extensively tested whether the settings actually make a difference. Technical Previews are generally 'buggy' too so problems may not solely be due to Boot Camp.\n", "Q: AppleScript in OS X 10.10 to Resize Safari window and take Screen Shot of that window and repeat with multiple sizes I would like to build an AppleScript Application that when run will do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Safari and navigate to a specific URL, or a line delimited file, or CSV.

When I want to save a document for the first time using Save As, in the 'Where' box I have 'Documents' showing. When I click the arrows to the right, I thought all Word folders would then appear but they don't—only 'Recent Place' appears. The only way I can get round this is to save the document in a 'Recent Place' then go into 'Finder' and move it into the correct Folder before I forget where I put it.\n\nA: If you click the disclosure triangle next to the filename, you'll see a Finder-like window. That will let navigate to any folder (or disk) that you want.\n\n\n\nA: The arrows normally navigate between folders you've already visited.  Try clicking on the \"Documents\" folder in the left-most pane of the \"Save...\" or \"Save As...\" dialog box.  This should expose your Documents folder.  \n \nAlso: play with the set of icons just to the right of the left and right arrows (triangles, really) just above the left-most pane of this dialog box. \n", "Q: Can I decrypt single EncFS files? I had a directory encrypted with encfs by MacFusion. I deleted some encfs file from there (something like .encfs6.xml, can't remember). I still have files and remember the password.\nNow when I want to mount this directory as encfs one, encfs wants to create new encrypted volume there. Can I somehow force it to open existing instead of creating new one?\n\nA: The .encfs6.xml file contains metadata that describes the encryption of the user's files. This is the one file that shouldn't be deleted and the short answer is to say that encryption is impossible without it.\nEncfs works by using a passphrase to make a key (potentially low entropy because it's derived from user input) that is used to encrypt another machine-generated (high entropy) key that is used for file encryption. That key is stored encrypted inside .encfs6.xml as <encodedKeyData> like this:\n<encodedKeyData>\nAVE9837475fv...VoE93845ee\n</encodedKeyData>\n\nIn theory, if you have that data and you know the passphrase used to encrypt it and you know all the ciper parameters used than you could decrypt using another tool such as OpenSSL. You'd need to look at the source code for encfs to work out exactly what it does and in what order but it would be possible to decrypt using another tool.\nBut you really need the parameters contained in the .encfs6.xml file to be able to decrypt, even if you plan to do so without the encfs software. So it's kind-of pointless because, if if you had that information you could reconstruct the xml file by hand and use encfs anyway.\n", "Q: How do I remove my visa from the App Store which has been declined?

I had a Apple developer program account. I was the company owner, and I had a user account. I lost control of it a couple of years back, when Apple got broken into and suffered one of their data breaches. I lost control because of all the password resets, new challenge questions, and tools like Xcode logging in with old credentials.\nThe company is out of business and I abandoned the account due to all the problems caused by Apple corporate. However, when I log in with my email address, its still attached to the non-existent company under the abandoned account. I'd like to contact Apple support and have my email address separated or disgorged from the company and the abandoned account.\nTrying to find a support contact is a labyrinth of rabbit wholes that lead nowhere. I visit the website (both Apple and the Developer), go to Support, try a Contact Us link, follow it for a while, and then I realize I've been punk'd because there is no way to contact them following the path I went down. For example, I start at Apple's How To Contact Us traverse through Manage your Apple ID and it ends in a dead end.\nQuestion: How do I contact Apple support to have the email address separated from the non-existent company and abandoned developer account?\n-----\nMy apologies for asking this question. One would think this would be a relatively easy endeavor, but its not. I'm fairly certain Apple is actively trying to keep folks from contacting them.\nI challenge anyone to start at Apple's How To Contact Us, and traverse through Manage your Apple ID, and actually end in a way to really contact Apple by email (preferred).

The job runs every hour and it works well.\nExcept the other day there was a power failure* and the rdiff-backup job was interrupted. The next time launchd ran the script, rdiff-backup failed and logged it's failure to the path specified in the plist. launchd, noticing the abnormal exit code, stopped trying to run the script.\nAnd I had no idea for six days. \nObviously I don't want a notification of the exit code every time the script finishes. What can I do to be notified only of abnormal exits?\n(*) turns out my UPS battery was passing the self-test when invoked, but didn't actually have the ability to power even a minimal load for more than 3 seconds.\n\nA: The traditional approach, e.g. with cron jobs, is to pipe standard error to a program like mail that's smart enough not to send you empty mail. The difference with launchd, as you've discovered, is that the mechanism for redirecting standard error is giving a StandardErrorPath for it to be written to, which isn't as convenient for this purpose as ending your crontab entry with | mail ….\nMy usual solution is to have a wrapper script check the StandardErrorPath and notify me if there's a problem. This can either be part of the same launchd job, so the checking happens before the next scheduled run, or you can have a separate job that just manages the error logs (maybe using a QueueDirectories key).\nI think you could also, for example, use a named pipe as your job's StandardErrorPath, but I've never actually tried that.\n", "Q: curl fails on OS X with SHA1 mismatch I'm experiencing problems with homebrew in OS X 10.10.2 and it seems that curl is causing them:\nbrew install gdal\n==> Installing dependencies for gdal: giflib, lzlib, proj, libgeotiff, ge\n==> Installing gdal dependency: giflib\n==> Downloading https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/giflib-4.1.\n######################################################################## 100.0%\nError: SHA1 mismatch\nExpected: 4900c1066c954c77f0590d954a6f8a6b77f55cec\nActual: a2fd3379ea944f6b2f97fb0f79b7b85cb3e14d0b\nArchive: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/giflib-4.1.6.yosemite.bottle.2.tar.gz\nTo retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.\nWarning: Bottle installation failed: building from source.\n==> Downloading https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/giflib/giflib-4.x/gifl\n######################################################################## 100.0%\nError: SHA1 mismatch\nExpected: 22680f604ec92065f04caf00b1c180ba74fb8562\nActual: a2fd3379ea944f6b2f97fb0f79b7b85cb3e14d0b\nArchive: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/giflib-4.1.6.tar.bz2\nTo retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.\n\nSomehow curl creates files that are way too small:\nls -al /Library/Caches/Homebrew/\ntotal 16\ndrwxrwxr-x   5 root    admin  170 Feb 10 20:57 .\ndrwxrwxrwt  15 root    admin  510 Feb 10 20:46 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  24 xxxxxx  admin  816 Feb 10 20:57 Formula\n-rw-r--r--   1 xxxxxx  admin  635 Feb 10 20:57 giflib-4.1.6.tar.bz2\n-rw-r--r--   1 xxxxxx  admin  635 Feb 10 20:57 giflib-4.1.6.yosemite.bottle.2.tar.gz\n\nAny thoughts?\nEdit 1:\nI have tried https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60223 but that didn't work.\nwhich curl\n/usr/local/bin/curl\n\nPath:\n$PATH\n-bash: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Users/xxxxxx/.rvm/bin:\n\n\nA: Sourceforge is down, try later.

I have a recent model (bought 1-2 years ago) Airport Extreme that, until yesterday, has worked flawlessly.\nStarting yesterday, my wireless speeds have tanked. I first suspected my ISP, but that doesn't seem to be the problem - my speeds seem to be fine through my wired devices (albeit subjectively - I haven't measured), just not the ones connected via Wi-Fi.\nMy setup is:\n\n\n*\n\n*A cable modem with a CAT-6 cable to the Airport Extreme.\n\n*A CAT-6 cable from the Airport Extreme to a cheap 8-port switch.\n\n*CAT-6 from the switch to a wall patch panel, which runs under the house to ports in 4 other rooms (where my wired devices live).\n\n\nThe devices that are wired (Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Xbox One) all seem to perform fine - I can stream video, download game updates, etc. at decent speeds. My Macbook Pro, Android phone, iPod and iPad are all affected by the slowness, though.\nThinking there was maybe some sort of priority given to streaming packets at some level, I also tried loading the Netflix player on my Macbook (connected via Wi-Fi), but that was also slow, leading me to believe that Wi-Fi, specifically, is the problem.\nSome other pertinent details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a 200Mbps plan via Time Warner, and a very recent cable modem (the model name/number escapes me) capable of close to 400Mbps. I've achieved the full speed of my plan regularly until yesterday. Nothing in my setup changed, so this almost certainly can't be a result of anything I've done.\n\n*Strangely, when I reset all of my internet hardware (modem, Airport Extreme, switch) and open a page in a browser on my Macbook, I briefly see fast Wi-Fi speeds. Within as little as a few seconds, though, my speeds drop severely (in the neighborhood of 0-5Mbps). I've even seen the same drop over the course of an online speed test - I can actually watch the \"speedometer\" needle gradually droop down to almost zero.\n\n*I need to try connecting my MBP straight to my cable modem to troubleshoot further - I'm sure that will tell me more - but the adapter cable I ordered is still in the mail.\n\n*I'll try a factory reset on the Airport Extreme tonight or tomorrow, but it would be nice to avoid that if possible.\n\n\nAre there any common issues that can explain this? Any standard troubleshooting steps that I may not have considered?\n\nA: 1. Wireless interference\nThe most common cause of what you describe here is a common wireless\ninterference problem.\nThis probability is pretty high if your network loss of performance\nwas closely related with the move of wirelessly connected\ncomputer or of pieces of furniture made of metal or glass (these cause\nmany radiofrequency reflections).\nIf you want to check this cause of your problem, download\niStumbler. Let it run for 10 minutes at the time when you have network problems. Then sort your neighbours network\nby decreasing signal level. If your channel is the same one as one of your strongers neighbours, then change it for a channel which isn’t among their channels.\nI have investigated very complex wireless interference problems since more\nthan 10 years with this exceptionnal quality software.\n2. Use of the wrong network interface\nThe second most popular culprit for this kind of problem is the use\nof the wrong network interface due to the infamous Automatic network\nconfiguration.\nTo check pretty quickly if you are in this case, the easy method\nis to make a new Network location (which in fact is not a location,\nbut a configuration) where the unique active interface will be\nyour wireless one (No BlueTooth, no Ethernet…). Make all the other\ninterfaces inactives (Make Service Inactive in the little dropdown menu).\nThe worst case I saw was a MacBook connected through the wireless network\nbut the one coming from the iPhone which was left configured as a hotspot.\nI let you imagine the nightmare connection since the iPhone was fully\nused… because the network on the MacBook was bad. In fact this was a 3G\nphone connection overloaded…and shared.\n3. Uninvited wireless scroungers\nIn urban environment, the third most popular culprit for your kind of\ntrouble is someone who either unwillingly or willingly connected to your\nwireless network.\nThis is a potential problem if your wireless network is open, is using\none of the fake security functions named WEP or WPA, is using a weak\npassword like 123456 or password on WPA2.\nTo detect this, use first iStumbler once more.\nAnd if you want to go further, check directly on your Extreme Base Station\nwho is connected on it. There is no better and clearer way to see these\nscroungers.\nDon't change your password at random as long as you didn't start a correct analysis. This won't help to understand a problem you might have\nto face repeatedly as long as you don't see it and kill it. For example, if you are using a fake security function, a neighbour who was able to get your password in 6 seconds, will do the same with any password.\n\nA: Here are two things to check.  \n1). Do you have any encryption on your WiFi network?  If so, I would recommend changing the password/key and using one that is at least 16 characters long and contains at least three of the four types of characters (lower case letter, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters like \"!\", \"@\", \"#\", \"$\", \"%\"...).  \nOne of your neighbors could have hacked into your WiFi account and could be downloading large amounts of data.  If you have Airport Utility 5.x, you can see a list of DHCP clients.  \nI am also a fan of DHCP reservations.  It allows you to more easily spot devices that aren't normally connected to your network.  \nYou can also try MAC address filtering to further enhance your networks security, although I personally find it too much of a hassle. I would suggest that you enable the Guest network for friends to connect to when they are at your house.  They'll have access to the internet, but not your local devices.  \n2) If you have old, legacy WiFi devices that don't support 802.11n, they could be slowing down your network, although not as much as you are reporting.  Enabling the Guest network and using that for slower devices could be a way to help the main network.\n", "Q: Different Graphics Switch options on Yosemite I'm used to see this checkbox in the Energy Saver window:\n\nWhen I turn it off it will switch to the discrete GPU.\nNow I'm using a program (gfxCardStatus) to switch between GPUs as I wish, and when I opened the Energy Saver window again I saw that the checkbox was replaced by this:\n\nWhich I saw some saying that was the way it was before the automatic switching feature.\nI'd like to know how this second screen can be enabled without using this program, because my discrete GPU has some issues and I'd like to leave it always on the integrated. \nAlso, I'd like to know if the meaning of \"Higher Performance\" is the same of unchecking the checkbox in the first screen, that is, to force the discrete GPU.\n\nA: On a Mac with dual switchable graphics (iGPU and dGPU) the general setup is as follows:\nBoot uses usually dGPU with limited, basic capabilities since the drivers aren't loaded yet. Once the GUI arrives the drivers for both iGPU and dGPU are available, full acceleration for both is available and the power management kicks in.\nFor graphics performance and power management Apple deems fit a rather simplistic scheme:\nThe default checkbox you see without gfxCardStatus means:\niGPU is used as default but anything requesting \"real graphics power\" leads to switching to the dGPU. Depending on the version of the operating system or the application this request could be quite arbitrary (e.g. just a simple Java stub with demanding graphics or a badly written app).\nInfluencing these settings leads to the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*checked \"Automatic Switching\" =  defaults to iGPU switchable to dGPU\n\n*unchecked \"Automatic Switching\" = defaults to dGPU not switchable to iGPU\n\n*checked \"Better Battery Life\" = defaults to iGPU not switchable to dGPU\n\n*checked \"Higher Performance\" = defaults to dGPU not switchable to iGPU\n\n\nSo, in effect, yes, \"Higher Performance\" is the same as unchecking the checkbox in the first screen, that is, to force the dGPU.\nOnly using hacks – like gfxCardStatus – it is possible to get into the state of forcing more iGPU and better battery life (compared to – sometimes badly working – \"Automatic Switching\"). All the configs Apple seems to offer are more graphics power: force more dGPU and therefore force worse battery life.\nIt might be possible with a hack or maybe even to cleanly force the appearance and availability of the choice you seek in SystemPreferences. \nBut for your alluded usage scenario gfxCardStatus is the best and cleanest option available. If your system is still usable.\nAlternatives:\nCody Krieger's original gfxCardStatus is no longer under active development fot some time now. It is not the only option: \nA newer/forked version (its development also ceased now) would be Steve Show's forked gfxCardStatus.\nPlease note: these versions of gfxCardStatus are a fine example for wisely choosing which version to use. The versions available have different options, abilities. The newest version might not be the best choice for what you want to achieve.\nA seemingly similar desire as yours, avoiding gfxCardSatus, led to the development of gpu-switch\nSo that option might be the part of this answer that comes closest to your question.\nFinally some precognizing: the point \"because my discrete GPU has some issues\" might need a more detailed approach. \nIf it is the AMD RadeonGate dGPU for MacBook Pro 8,2, 2011, I'd suggest lobotomising the dGPU with software out of the system. A complete guide for that would be here: GPU Problem. Further pointers to mitigating hacks for the most common issues for badly designed and manufactured MacBook Pros in the past are listed also in the announcement of ceased development here: https://github.com/steveschow/gfxCardStatus\n\nA: It seems you have some of your wording backwards.  The integrated card is the low power card that is built into the motherboard of your computer.  The discrete card is the higher power card that has been added (by Apple) to a socket on the motherboard of your computer.  Integrated consumes less power, while discrete consumes more power.\nIf you are using gfxCardStatus and you choose integrated only mode, will only run on the integrated card.  There are some applications that will not work, or will not work well if you select this mode.  Also secondary displays will not work in this mode.\nIf you are choose discrete only mode, this forces the computer to use the discrete, higher powered graphics card.  In this mode your computer you can use external displays and run any application.  You will be consuming more power then necessary in some cases, and can thus expect shorter battery life.\nIf you are certain that you have something wrong with your discrete card, and you switch to integrated only mode, you will not be able to run a second display.  You probably should have Apple look at the computer and repair the discrete card.\n", "Q: Apple ID password vs iCloud password - better to be the same or different? I have too many passwords to track on too many devices. With my apple devices & services, it would be easier for me if both my iCloud and Apple ID passwords were the same.\nShould this be ok or is it bad security practice? Is there a recommendation? What do most people do?\n\nA: First, you usually don't need a different Apple ID for iCloud:\n\nWe recommend that you use the same Apple ID for Store purchases and iCloud. Using multiple Apple IDs might be confusing and might cause issues with accessing purchased content or using some services.\n\nIf you do have two Apple ID's, Apple has this to say about reusing passwords:\n\nAvoid using your Apple ID password with other online accounts.\n\nPassword reuse is problematic because all your security depends on the \"weakest link\", the less secure –or more exposed– service. Once that service is compromised, all your services are.\nXKCD has this to say about the subject:\n\nOn the matter of remembering passwords, XKCD –sorry, again– has some iconic graphical input, analyzed and validated here by the people at InfoSec SE.\n\nIn a nutshell, passwords must be difficult to guess and easy to remember, and he proposes the use of passphrases instead of short, complicated passwords.\nYet others think that \n\nThe Only Secure Password Is the One You Can’t Remember\n\nwhich is my philosophy by the way.\nIn order to achieve this apparent nonsense, you use a Password manager, (iCloud Keychain, Keepass, 1Password, LastPass), and generate different random secure passwords for every service. You only have to remember one master password –where you could apply XKCD's idea.\nPeople have different opinions on how secure password managers are; if you are a bit paranoid or have very sensitive data you may want to have an eidetic memory instead, although one known cryptographer and security expert advocates the use of at least one –not cloud synced, though.\n", "Q: Finder folders have no triangle to twirl I am running 10.9.5 and some folders in list view have no triangles by the subfolders.

I have my Dropbox folder in the partition. I have tried using it in the past formatted as exFAT. This was unsatisfactory in that it would not stay indexed in OS X, and there were other issues. \nI have now formatted the Data partition as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Then on Windows 7, I have a trial version of Paragon HFS+ for Windows installed.\nHere is my issue. OS X creates a bunch of files in Dropbox ending in com.dropbox.attributes. There is at least one of these almost for every file in Dropbox. From OS X these do not sync to the Dropbox server and are hidden. However, in Windows they are visible and sync to the Dropbox server. \nI would like to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hide them in Windows 7\n\n*Prevent them from syncing to the Dropbox server in Windows 7\n\n\n(By the way, I have already tried running a command in Windows that hides all of these files.  It only worked temporarily. As soon as Dropbox was back up and running they re-appeared.)\nPlease let me know if you need any more information or clarification. \nUpdate: \nI appreciate the input, Rich. After looking here more closely, I can see how it is pretty much a lost cause without Dropbox's fix for it. By my post I was curious if hiding or making them marked as \"system files\" would make a difference or to see if there were other ideas. I had tested the possibility of running a bat file on startup that did the following (hide and mark them as a \"system file\"):\nattrib +S +H *.dropbox.attributes /S\nI learned quickly that the issue is that Dropbox in conjunction with Windows 7 actually creates the com.dropbox.attributes files and that it is not OS X that creates the files. The extended attributes of OS X cause Windows to create them. So, they get created anew every time Dropbox runs in Windows. I will plan to file a bug report. \nIt is too bad that partitions between OS X and Windows don't play nice. My Data partition at home between two Linux distros and Windows 7 works beautifully, no such issues. Between OS X and Windows the extended attributes of OS X (in conjunction with Dropbox of course) seems to be the main culprit. This was the case when I tried to use this Data partition formatted as exfat. Who knows, maybe one day all OSs will be compatible with all formatting types and work well together.   \n\nA: There is nothing that you do about this other than try to hide them.   It occurs because one file system doesn't support extended attributes.\nThere have been quite a few posts on the dropbox forum and I suggest you file a bug report with dropbox.  They'll claim it is normal behavior but they still need to find a fix.\n", "Q: Clone hard disk of old macbook to new macbook? I have a MacBook mid 2014 with Yosemite on it.

If you get a successful boot it will either be 10.6 or 10.10, and at this point I'd strongly suggest making a USB installer for Yosemite rather than simply running the install application. One good reason for doing this is if you have a disk failure or upgrade to an SSD it will save time otherwise wasted performing an Internet Recovery, and you can be sure of having a proper \"clean\" install.\nIf you can't boot into any OS try holding  Opt ⌥   at the startup chime, in case the Yosemite installer successfully created a recovery partition.

Select the image and press ⌘ CMD+i, or right click on that image and choose Get Info menu item.\n\nImage from cultofmac.com\nQuickLook plugin\nIf you weren't on 10.9 - this lightweight QuickLook plugin called qlImageSize which can be found on GitHub lets You check the image size on the quicklook window title. I don't have any that work on 10.9, but perhaps this will help you if you wish to search for a similar one or report 10.9 compatibility to that project for improvement.\n\n\nA: From the command line, if you have Imagemagick 7.x installed (for example through homebrew or the installer), then you can use the following command to quickly display the resolution and similar information of multiple images in a directory (if you are still on the older Imagemagick 6.x, then the command is just identify instead of magick identify):\n$ ls\na.jpg\nb.png\nc.png\n$ magick identify *\na.jpg JPEG 550x309 550x309+0+0 8-bit sRGB 29.4KB 0.000u 0:00.000\nb.png[1] PNG 1912x827 1912x827+0+0 8-bit sRGB 2.17MB 0.000u 0:00.009\nc.png[2] PNG 311x262 311x262+0+0 8-bit sRGB 185KB 0.000u 0:00.000\n\nOr if you only need the resolution:\n$ magick identify * | cut -d' ' -f1,3\na.jpg 550x309\nb.png[1] 1912x827\nc.png[2] 311x262\n\nSpecifying -verbose will give you even more quick information which you can grep in case it's needed:\n$ magick identify -verbose c.png\nImage: c.png\n  Format: PNG (Portable Network Graphics)\n  Mime type: image/png\n  Class: DirectClass\n  Geometry: 311x262+0+0\n  Units: Undefined\n  Type: TrueColor\n  Endianess: Undefined\n  Colorspace: sRGB\n  Depth: 8-bit\n  Channel depth:\n    red: 8-bit\n    green: 8-bit\n    blue: 8-bit\n  Channel statistics:\n    Red:\n      min: 0 (0)\n      max: 255 (1)\n      mean: 154.515 (0.60594)\n      standard deviation: 66.9006 (0.262355)\n      kurtosis: -0.83131\n      skewness: -0.468887\n    Green:\n      min: 0 (0)\n      max: 255 (1)\n      mean: 148.544 (0.582527)\n      standard deviation: 77.5386 (0.304073)\n      kurtosis: -1.18136\n      skewness: -0.438364\n    Blue:\n      min: 27 (0.105882)\n      max: 255 (1)\n      mean: 176.548 (0.692343)\n      standard deviation: 62.2995 (0.244312)\n      kurtosis: -0.971188\n      skewness: -0.584194\n  Image statistics:\n    Overall:\n      min: 0 (0)\n      max: 255 (1)\n      mean: 159.869 (0.626937)\n      standard deviation: 69.2078 (0.271403)\n      kurtosis: -0.754397\n      skewness: -0.568073\n  Rendering intent: Perceptual\n  Gamma: 0.454545\n  Chromaticity:\n    red primary: (0.64,0.33)\n    green primary: (0.3,0.6)\n    blue primary: (0.15,0.06)\n    white point: (0.3127,0.329)\n  Background color: white\n  Border color: srgb(223,223,223)\n  Matte color: grey74\n  Transparent color: black\n  Interlace: None\n  Intensity: Undefined\n  Compose: Over\n  Page geometry: 311x262+0+0\n  Dispose: Undefined\n  Iterations: 0\n  Compression: Zip\n  Orientation: Undefined\n  Properties:\n    date:create: 2015-02-11T15:20:41+00:00\n    date:modify: 2015-01-28T10:04:15+00:00\n    png:iCCP: chunk was found\n    png:IHDR.bit-depth-orig: 8\n    png:IHDR.bit_depth: 8\n    png:IHDR.color-type-orig: 2\n    png:IHDR.color_type: 2 (Truecolor)\n    png:IHDR.interlace_method: 0 (Not interlaced)\n    png:IHDR.width,height: 311, 262\n    signature: 35b3a0e9c50c785bece1ceff5a202823922cc78c2740cf9e0ff30d6143c89fdf\n  Profiles:\n    Profile-icc: 3276 bytes\n  Artifacts:\n    filename: c.png\n    verbose: true\n  Tainted: False\n  Filesize: 185KB\n  Number pixels: 81.5K\n  Pixels per second: 2.716MB\n  User time: 0.000u\n  Elapsed time: 0:01.029\n  Version: ImageMagick 7.0.10-34 Q16 x86_64 2020-10-09 https://imagemagick.org\n\n\nA: The fastest way is to have the resolution details visible all time ;)\nCheck out the step below:\n\n\n\n\n*COLUMN VIEW\n\nA: The simplest way from the command line is to use the built-in file command:\nfile ping-pong.png\n\nOutputs:\nping-pong.png: PNG image data, 380 x 343, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\n\nMore metadata will be displayed if available.\nThis will also work on Linux systems.

I was bothered with poor wifi on the MacBook for some time, while other devices worked just fine in the same room. Sometimes I would take my MacBook and go to another room to see if wifi works better on it and it did. This morning I got pretty annoyed how I could not open a news article in my room, but could stream 1440p videos on Youtube no problems just outside the room. So I grabbed my desk out of the room and to my surprise it still would not work properly. However as soon as I unplugged the external monitor, the wifi works just fine. After a few 'try and see' I worked out that wifi works fine when the brightness on the internal screen is on. I have no idea why it works like this and I am probably wrong with my guessing.\nMy problem is to have wifi work while the internal monitor remain none of the brightness. \nWhen researching on this topic I found this and looked into it. However I never shut the lid so it's not a case here. Apart of that question I could not find anything close to my problem. So I wonder if anyone had a similar issue and any possible solutions?\n\nA: You should try to do a PRAM reset. You do it by holding command + shift + P + R on the MacBook keyboard on start-up, when it does the boot sound the second time, stop holding the keys. This should solve.  Even though I suggest you to use an ethernet cable with your MacBook lid closed. If your setup isn't near your modem try using some powerlines. Here  you have a link for some pretty good ones.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-PA4010KIT-Powerline-Adapter-Starter/dp/B00AWRUICG/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&dpID=31IYBNuPwFL&dpPl=1&keywords=powerline&pi=AC_SY200_QL40&qid=1436666780&ref=plSrch&ref_=mp_s_a_1_1&sr=8-1\n\nA: The problem is caused by the MacBook being closed, because the antennas aren't transmitting properly. If you open your MacBook while having it connected to the external monitor you'll see that Wi-Fi will work properly.\n", "Q: Where should I place shared folders on an OS X Server? What is the appropriate/reccomended location in the drive hierarchy to place the folders shared by the users accessing the server (as fileserver) ?\nIs it in /Groups /Users/Shared or ~/Documents/ ?\nOr should I create a separate folder in /Users for each group ?\nIs there a document/webpage that supplies instructions about that ?\n\nA: Generally, the shared folders for a group should go in /Groups/groupname/.\n/Users/Shared/ is more designed for local users to share, though there's nothing stopping you from using this too other than it is non-standard.\n\nA: I add to the correct answer from grgarside that documentation from Apple can be found here http://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/4.0/\nI have to say the documentation is good but not excellent so here is a little \"recipe\" for the most common setup.\nA common practice is to create users, to create groups, to assign users to groups. (one user can belong to none, one, many groups of course) and finally to give groups access to shared folders.\nWhen a group is created from the Server application check the option  Create a shared folder for this group. As you click Ok to confirm the group creation the folder is created as well into /Groups\nDon't create yourself the folders inside /Groups as this (may) mess things up (this happened to me).\nYou finally go to the Sharing pane and add the folders inside /Groups to the list of shared folders.\nEach shared folder will be automatically set to be read-writeable by its group.\nFinally you turn file sharing on.\n", "Q: MBP late 2008 HDD and SSD setup I just upgraded my old MBP to SSD and put my old HDD in my optical drive space for a duo-HD setup. I am running Yosemite on the SSD.\nI wanted to use my HDD as a Window 7 setup. However, when I go into boot camp to do this, my computer shuts down and hangs. Is this because of the boot sequence of optical drive comes first? Or is this due to something else?\nCan I not run windows on the old HDD?\n\nA: If you're simply wanting to dedicate your old HDD to Windows 7 duties you don't need to use Boot Camp to do it. Simply partition and format the HDD as FAT (Windows will insist on it being formatted as NTFS when installing), reboot your Mac while holding alt/option and insert your Windows install media. You will then be able to install Windows without further issues.\nBoot Camp is only necessary when dual-booting from a single drive. OS X requires a GPT partition to boot from whereas Windows 7 expects an MBR partition. Boot Camp creates a hybrid partition table that works for both systems, but this process isn't necessary if each system has its own dedicated drive.\n", "Q: Mount combo (USB/COM) device I've bought this simple navigator that works fine on PC using the software released by the company but there is no mac version for it.

The catch being, which column will have to be skipped over will be different every time.\nMaybe there is a way to \"mark\" a column to be ignored, with the help of a checkbox, perhaps?\nOr is there an even easier, more obvious way that has eluded me?\n\nA: In practice, you could sum each column and then sum just the the sum row.\nThat way, you can delete the sum of the column to be skipped when needed and it should be clear about which of the columns is ignored.\nA more general solution will be tricky since it's programming in conditional values or conditional functions that are much harder to maintain, debug and be confident your math is correct as you use the tool over time.\n", "Q: \"Evernote Premium\" text is hovering on my screen, despite Evernote app being closed I have some text hovering over my screen, in all my spaces, for at least the past 2 weeks.

Try again later I am trying to install an app form App Store and getting \"This item is temporarily unavailable. Try again later.\" Tried to install the app on different macs (with the same icloud ID), but still getting the same problem. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: If your \"try again later\" is minutes or even a few hours, you might just have to wait for the web service to complete the transaction scheduled for that app.\nYou could use the developer's contact information / support site to see if they are in the middle of a release - the developer knows when the product is released for sale and/or a price change which can cause this error temporarily.\nLastly, you can contact Apple Store support to have them investigate whether it's a problem on their end with the app in question or whether it's a problem with your AppleID / store account. If so, they can tell you if it's on Apple's end to fix or if you have to fix it.\nBasically, several things could be broken and you'll need to work through them one by one to reach a solution.\n\nA: This may happen after switching your AppleID country.\nYou may be able to resolve this by signing in again, e.g. by clicking on the \"Purchased\" tab and clicking \"Sign in\".\n", "Q: Touch ID doesn't work first thing in the morning? Here's a weird one.\nI have an iPhone 6 Plus, and the last phone I had was the iPhone 5 so this is the first device I've had with Touch ID. I'm using Apple's leather case and no screen protectors or anything.\nI use it as an alarm clock and so sometimes when I wake up I notice there's something like an email I need to see immediately.\nWhat I've noticed is that when I first wake up, Touch ID doesn't let me in. Like, it doesn't even recognize I'm touching it. I don't get the \"try again\" like I'm using the wrong part of the finger or wrong finger, the screen just turns off after a few seconds like I'm not doing anything. I have to unlock using my keycode. If I quickly lock my phone and try again it still doesn't work. If I try a few minutes later it works fine.\nI don't think this is a hardware or software flaw, my guess is that there's something about my hands first thing in the morning that the Touch ID sensor has problems with but I can't imagine what. \nDoes anyone else have this happen or know why it happens? Or is it just me?\n\nA: Probably (maybe? possibly?), your finger looks \"dead\" first thing in the morning. Touch ID uses both capacitive sensing,  which is activated by the slight electrical charge running through your skin, and radio frequency sensing which does not respond to the dead layer of skin on the outside of your finger -- the part that might be chapped or too dry to be read with much accuracy -- and instead reads only the living tissue underneath. This is why you can't unlock a phone with someone's dead finger.\nSo, one theory is that your finger, when you're first waking up, isn't in quite the same state as your finger later in the day, on the day when you set up your touch ID.\nBut, this could all be inaccurate.\nHow to test?\nIdea 1. Try massaging your fingers first thing in the morning before trying to unlock the phone. Maybe getting the blood flowing in your finger will make it look right.  \nIdea 2. This one would be very interesting. Next time you wake up and your finger isn't working, unlock your iPhone and then use your finger to set up a new Touch ID. Then, the next day, see if your early morning finger can unlock the phone.\nVery curious to hear your results :-)\n\nA: Just started happening to me on my new 6.  Tried setting up new print and still did not respond.  Took off the new .case that barely covers a bit of the bottom and Surprise, it worked.  I will try again tomorrow am.  I think it is related to contact area and skin temp.\n\nA: Never had this problem particularly in the morning, however, I was also unsatisfied in general, sometimes it just didn't work well. However, I registered my thumb multiple times with separate profiles (e.g., cold, slightly wet, and normal warm thumbs), and now it just works like a charm.\n", "Q: How to uninstall individual Office365 components in Mac OS X There is [un]surprisingly little or no useful information I could find on uninstalling individual components when you install the full Office365 suite on your Mac.\nAll I want is Word and Excel, and want to get rid of the rest.

I am a junior-level developer beginning to work on a project that requires me to use Apache 7.0.x, and I'm running Yosemite with a Windows 7 VM. When I did some research on how to get Apache, I discovered that Mac comes with Apache pre-installed. However, it seems that the version is 2.4. Since Apache runs on JRE, it seems to me that I should be able to have Apache 7 so long as I have Java 7, but the version numbers are throwing me off.\nWhy is the versioning so far off, and what do I need to do to be able to run apache 7 on my Mac? Developing on my Windows VM is an option, but I prefer to keep everything on the Mac side.\nEDIT:\nIt seems that I misunderstood: what I need is Apache Tomcat (Wikipedia), which I now embarrassedly know is something different than the Apache HTTP Server ‘httpd’ (Wikipedia). If I have further issues I'll update accordingly.\n\nA: The best option for you will be install package manager HomeBrew and then run in the terminal:\nbrew install tomcat\n\n\nA: I prayed to google and it told me that you can install Tomcat 7 under Mountain Lion and Mavericks, but apparently Java does not come with Yosemite.  \nThe answer to my prayers was found at Installing Tomcat 7.0.x on OS X\nYou can also find more answers with Installing Tomcat 8 on OS X 10.10 Yosemite\n[And I am already flagellating myself over a link only answer]\n\nA: After clearing up my misunderstanding (I needed Apache Tomcat 7, not Apache 7 (which doesn't even exist)), I was able to install Tomcat easily by following this walkthrough.\n", "Q: Racoon - Invalid Major Version 32 I'm playing around with StrongSwan to setup a VPN connection between two mac's on Ubuntu and OSX.

Hold these keys until the computer restarts\nand you hear the startup sound for a second time.\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\nAfter resetting NVRAM, you may need to reconfigure settings for speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, and time zone information.\n", "Q: Why are my earbuds making dolphin noises? What I'm hearing...\nOf the three vocalizations dolphins produce, my iPhone 6 earbuds have started making two: whistles and clicks. This clip is the closest I could find to the sounds I'm hearing. Now of course, these noises only approximate dolphin-y noises. The whistle sounds more electrical, the clicks more mechanical, than the organic noises of actual mammals. But they do share many aural traits with dolphin vocalizations, so it's a quick way to explain what I'm experiencing. Some of the traits held in common are pitch, note length, and note frequency. I'll visualize their amplitude over time with some rudimentary ASCII charts.\nTime →\nAmplitude ↑\nWhistle (pitch is high):\n_--````````````------________\nClicks (pitch is Mid-range):\n_- _- _- _- _- _- _- _- _- _- _- _-\nWhat I've learned so far...\n\n\n*\n\n*These noises are noticeable when there's no other audio. I usually hear them before I make a phone call or start listening to a podcast. \n\n*The whistles stop if I unplug my standard-issue earbuds, letting the cord dangle. The clicks pretty much stop then as well.\n\n*Jiggling the cable—whether it's plugged in to the iPhone or not—does nothing to influence the noises. I've tried jiggling the cable at all the junctures where I suspect a weak connection might form without avail.\n\n*My attempts to decipher the language of dolphins have yielded no clues into a semantic interpretation of these noises. (Okay, this last one's a joke. But my question is genuine, asked in good faith.)\n\n\nWhat I'd like to know...\nWhat is the explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA: It's not a driver/software/audio card issue, because the dolphin noises don't occur with other headphones or when playing music through the speaker (via Buscar above). It's probably a bad ground (via soulshined above), but without stripping the wires and testing each connection, it's impossible to say for sure.\nI went to the Apple Store with a Genius Bar appointment for another issue (cracked iPhone screen) and asked them about it. Apple replaced my headphones for free.\n", "Q: Open Terminal.app but hold open?

We have employees who are issued both an iPhone and an iPad. \nThe iPads are on Verizon and have unlimited data. \nThe iPhones are on AT&T and have limited data. \nThe problem happens when they are using the iPads and lose service. The iPads automatically switch on the iPhones hotspot and start using it. This is causing the users to go over their AT&T data limit when using their iPads.\nIs there any way to stop them from automatically switching over to the iPhones data? \n\nA: The feature you are describing is called \"Instant Hotspot,\" though you will not see that phrase in the UI of any of your devices.  Instant Hotspot allows Macs and iOS devices to use the \"Personal Hotspot\" feature of one an iOS device to provide internet connectivity to a Mac or another iOS device, without the need to switch on the Personal Hotspot feature on the host iOS device.\nIn order to use Instant Hotspot, each device must be signed into the same iCloud account.  That's it.  There is no switch to enable or disable.  Just sign into the same account.\nIt seems impractical to ask your users to use separate iCloud accounts for their phones and iPads... so your best solution may be to call up AT&T and ask that the Personal Hotspot feature be disabled on the phones... thus ensuring that the iPads will stick to their native data connections.\n\nA: I have the same problem and have been talking to Apple. It is caused by the iPhone and iPad having the same username and password to iCloud. The only way I got around this is by turning off Bluetooth on the iPad, which stopped them creating the hotspot but still allowed my car kit to work on the iPhone. \n\nA: I found this same probm - BUT I have wifi only for the ipad and Verizon for my iphone.  Tricky. I turned off Bluetooth on both.  OK now.\n", "Q: On Macbook Pro, how to tell if my hard drive access speed is a bottleneck to my current computer performance? I'm considering giving my 2010 Macbook Pro an upgrade.  Whether upgrading its 500 GB hard drive to SSD drive is a priority depends on how much it bottlenecks the computer's performance.  Is there a reliable and quantitative way to measure this?\nUpdate:\nCurrent system configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X 10.10.2\n\n*Macbook Pro 17\" (,id 2010)\n\n*Memory: 8GB\n\n*CPU: 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 512 MB\n\n*Hard drive: 500GB SATA disk\n\n*About this Mac > System Report > Hardware > SATA/SATA Express > ... Rotational Rate: 7200 ...\n\nA: With Yosemite, we're noticing an somewhat, but not totally, subjective slowdown to all aspects of the OS, despite the minimum 4 GB RAM.\nAt our school we are actively replacing any faculty member's MBP's internal HDD with a SSD if they complain of 'slowness' and they can demonstrate it concretely. This can be in the form of a slow startup; slow-loading apps; frequent SPODs; anything which gets in the way of teaching. Stock MBPs use slower 5400 RPM drives, which is where some of the problems originate. Even updating to a 7200 RPM drive can help alleviate the perceived slowness.\nGranted, some of the slowness can be attributed to never restarting the MBP, ever; having the ENTIRE Office '11 suite of apps open at startup; few free GB on the HDD; and similar user issues, but we've found the complaints go away when the HDD is replaced with something faster.\nThe only complaint we get after the swap is that the SSD we offer is usually 1/2 the size (or less) of the stock HDD, forcing users to move their iTunes libraries onto external disks or actually cleaning out the cruft from the HDDs. To alleviate this, we put the removed HDD in an inexpensive USB external enclosure as part of the deal.\nGo for the SSD upgrade. You won't look back.\n\nA: \"I would like to know if hard drive access speed is a bottleneck to my system currently.\"\nOf course! There are two aspects to a disk storage system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bus speed\n\n*Storage medium speed\n\n\nOn ANY given bus, e.g., SATA, SATA2, SATA3, a mechanical HDD will be an order of magnitude slower than an SSD for a given link speed. The secret is to always use an SSD that features at minimum the same link speed as the disk controller. It can be of benefit, however, to use an SSD (or HDD if you're financially challenged) that features a faster link speed than its host.\nFor example, I'm using a Crucial M500 960 GB SSD in my MacBook4,1. The SSD is a SATA 3, 6 Gb/s drive, whereas the MacBook has a SATA 1.5 Gb/sec controller. The drive performance is marginally (!) better due to its higher internal processing speeds than would be a 1.5 Gb/sec SATA SSD on the same system.\nMechanical hard disks are painfully slow compared to their SSD counterparts. In ANY computer system, the HDD and its attendant controller will be the biggest bottleneck. As such, to ensure best performance, you should use the fastest storage medium possible.\n", "Q: Logic Pro X 10.1 update button does nothing I have Logic 10.0.7 and got a notice to update to 10.1.

I have a photo, but not sure how to post it here.\n\nA: Unless you bought a very old iMac, its external display port is most likely mini-DVI.

But I succeeded with the second newest backup.\nSince the restoration, the Spotlight icon has disappeared from the corner of the menu bar, and cannot be activated with keyboard shortcuts. The same problem exists whether I start in safe mode or from a fresh account. \nThe .app file still exists in CoreServices, and indexing appears to continue, as I am able to conduct searches through finder windows. I have tried emptying all the caches, restarting SystemUIServer and the menubar itself. \nI have never, to my knowledge, instructed an application or the computer to hide Spotlight from the menubar. And though I doubt this is the issue, it is interesting that when I select in Onyx the option to hide it, and then deselect it, there’s a short little flash in the corner where the icon should be as if it tries to start for a moment but for whatever reason crashes. \nIt appears from the console that every second it is trying to load when this happens: \n\nfile:///Users/SRF/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Spotlight_2015-02-11-163022_MacBookPro.crash\n2/11/15 4:30:46.173 PM    com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.Spotlight[1951]) Service exited due to signal: Trace/BPT trap: 5\n2/11/15 4:30:46.173 PM    com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.Spotlight) Service only ran for 0 seconds.

remove .plist files from your user library preferences.\nIf it is not functional, then you will need to reinstall Yosemite from the recovery partition due to the application being corrupt. \n", "Q: Is it possible to get font size in any apps in OS X? I want to get font size (and font family, if possible) that is used in any Mac applications. For example, in Calendar.app, you can find that the date is bold and bigger than any texts that is displayed on the app. \nIs is possible to investigate the font in any texts in any applications in OS X? Or is there any app like the Chrome extension WhatFont, (which displays the font information including size and family under the cursor)?\n\nA: WhatFont is not as magical as it seems - it's simply surfacing information already present in the web page coding (the font being used) in a way that is easy for non-technical users. There is no program that I am aware of that will identify fonts under the cursor when the information is not already available.\nMyFonts has a service called WhatTheFont! where you can submit a screenshot and it will try to identify by matching your image against known samples in their database.\n", "Q: How do I use an \"intersection\" symbol in word?

I clean up and only delete certain texts. When I do that the name and group of texts does not fall into the chronological line up, it stays at the top. Does that make sense? Why does it do that?\n\nA: Totally concur... On my old 4S, when I would delete some but not necessarily ALL of some messages in a conversation, that conversation would drop in my messages to its proper place, based on the date of the that last text.\nWith 6S, someone from 6 mos ago can send you a text.  After you reply and delete it, that message thread from 6 mos ago stays on top.\nWith the old 4S, they would drop down to their proper place based on date of last text.\nThat's a big bummer about the new iPhones versus the old ones.  And it makes it easy for something important to fall off the radar.\n.\n", "Q: Why do symlinks sometimes vanish in Xcode? The source files of interest are on a network share hosted on a Win7 machine, but the symlinks are created on this Mac using ln -sf\nThese are .h files, and sometimes one or more of them are not found by the C++ compiler.  I get an error like foo.h is not found, when I can see it and read the (linked-to) contents using Finder.\nMy work-around is to copy the file instead of symlink to it.  Then I find that the other files (symlink .h files in the same directory linking to files in the same source directory; just like the \"bad\" one) have no problems.\nWhich one(s) are affected will vary, too.\nAny idea what could be causing this?  It started when updating Mac OSX to Mavericks, which has different CIFS network code.  It still happens with Yosemite.\nNote that the symlink does work on the Mac in general; I make it on that Mac, and even when it's having the error in Xcode I can see the file contents resolved as expected in the Columns view in Finder, or with cat on the bash prompt.  It's only Xcode's compiler's problem.\nMore Specifics\nThe files are part of a “framework” and the link (example)\ncd /Volumes/There/blah/blah2/blah3/blah3/CocoaPods/Pods/BuildHeaders/Cheeseburger\nln -sf ../../Cheeseburger/Burger/head1.h\n  ⋮ a bunch of files in same path, head2.h, head3.h, etc.\n\ncd ../../Headers/Cheeseburger\nln -sf ../../Cheeseburger/Burger/head1.h\n  ⋮ etc.\n\nI'll get an error finding head5.h, and the others work fine.  \n\nA: Symlinks are often destroyed by some archiving tools, especially by those built into some versions of PHP, for example. Try to pack and unpack an archive and check if symlinks are still alive.\nAlso, symlinks won't be saved on NTFS or similar non-mac filesystem.\nPlease check if symlinks get broken after you access the drive from Windows computer.\n", "Q: User file very big my users file in macbook air 11\" is 30 GB. How can I free up some of this storage space? I can't upgrade to Yosemite until I have more free storage.\n\nA: Run a utility like the excellent (and free) Disk Inventory X, this will show you which files are consuming the most space and you will then be able to decide what needs to go to make space. If you find it useful consider making a small donation - it's been around for a few years and proven invaluable at times ;-)\nYou should also think about upgrading your drive size. If you don't have enough room to install Yosemite you probably don't have enough space for the system to \"breathe\" properly - there should always be a few GB free for temporary system files (swap files etc.)...\n\nA: *\n\n*Back up your Mac (start a Time Machine backup and continue to investigate)\n\n*Open finder and select the Macintosh HD and press Command 2 and then Command J (this selects list view and then make sure \"Calculate All Sizes\" is checked for that finder window. Optionally check use as defaults if you want all finder windows to show you sizes of files and folders.)\n\n*Click on Size and then wait for the system to add up all the sizes in each folder.\n\n\nDon't delete things yet, but use the triangles next to folders to dive down and see what areas large files exist (10 GB or larger).\nOnce the backup finishes you can make decisions on what to delete or move to another drive temporarily. Post a new thread if you need help running Disk Utility or if the files are in trash, etc... Also, be careful to not delete system files if you don't have a plan to reinstall your OS.\n", "Q: What does hidden windows mean? Mission control supposed to show everything running on Mac. The definition for Mission Control given by this website also confirms that (see the screen shot shown bellow.

What am I missing?\nEDIT: Apple support page says Mission Control is the quick way to see everything that's currently open on your Mac. Does this mean hidden windows are closed? What does actually hidden windows mean?\n\nA: You shouldn't take a tag description on a web site not affiliated with Apple as a feature description. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100 for how Apple defines Mission Control (emphasis mine):\n\nMission Control is the quick way to see everything that's currently open on your Mac. To use Mission Control, do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Swipe up with three or four fingers on your Trackpad\n  \n*Double-tap the surface of your Magic Mouse with two fingers\n  \n*Click the Mission Control icon in the Dock or Launchpad\n  \n*On an Apple keyboard, press the Mission Control key\n  \n  \n  In Mission Control, all of your open windows and spaces are visible, grouped by app.\n\n\nA: \nMission Control is the quick way to see everything that's currently\n  open on your Mac.\n\nThe above statement from the Apple help page WAS true, but now it is OUTDATED. Mission Control used to show all open windows including hidden ones, but Apple excluded hidden windows from the list in the recent versions of OS X. But the documentation is not updated yet.\n(About your 2nd question: Hidden windows are not closed windows, they are open ones, but you cannot see them until you make them unhidden.

How do I see windows3,4,5 of TextEdit in desktop2 in a similar/same manner as Application windows?\nPossibly a duplicate of How to modify app expose to show only open windows of current application on current desktop?\n\nA: It is simple. You don't. \nI have MAC 2 months and Iv heard UX of MAC is gorgeous so I went for it. But for some strange reason MAC has 95% of UX realy awesome as I would expect the top UX to be BUT, there are still those 5% :( And I am not talking about some hard to use UX elements or hidden tasks. Those 5% are everyday usage UX errors MAC has. And when I say error I mean it, its not like I prefer Windows or Linux way, its that human has some \"limitations\" and for many tasks the \"best\" UX already exists but in Apple there sits some UX manager (propably few of them) and he thinks like this: \"Hmm, we have to differ on as many levels as possible so we are not the same as competition\" - so they take that UX, tweak those 5% of it, so it looks different.\nHow do I know that? Well ofc, I dont, but is there any other logical explenation for that and theese other examples:\nApp window control buttons on the left side? Yes its briliant - your mouse moves are limited, so your work is faster. It takes a while if ur not used to it, but it is realy good idea and its faster. But now - what will those 3 buttons acutually do? Quit app / minimize app / maximize app? Noooo, that would be too easy for everyone, lets make it different, lets make close button to close only \"windows\" of the app not entire app and lets leave the top bar of app hanging there so everyone can switch to it and be confused where is his focus, cause he sees the app below but it doesnt have focus right...? Minimize? Yea, it does minimize - did they notice, that minimize and close does the same thing? (It actually doesnt - but the result is the same, so \"why....?) Nope they didnt. And maximize? No, why would someone want to maximize, lets make it fullscreen, cause thats the button every person needs, right...? But one brave manager raised hand and said: \"But there are still ppl who actually want to maximize the window\". \"Hmm, ok lets keep it there with some wier shortcut, BUT lets not maximize to cover all screen, I think it is better to maximize only what we think is the best for the user. With more windows opened at once, its gonna be so messy but we dont care about it.

The problem characters are these: []{}|\\\nOn my SE Mac keyboard, I use these combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*[] - any alt + 8/9 \n\n*{} - any alt + shift + 8/9\n\n*| - any alt + 7\n\n*\\ - any alt + shift + 7\n\n\nWhen in Bootcamp, it behaves like a Swedish PC keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*[] - right alt + 8/9\n\n*{} - right alt + 7/0\n\n*| - right alt + >\n\n*\\ - right alt + ?\n\n\nI have tried numerous keyboard settings without any difference.\nI was able to switch control and command using a register key but I have found no way to switch the combinations above.\nIs there any way to fix this?\nAs I understand it, US keyboards  do not have this problem since the above keys maps the same way on Mac and PC keyboards. I really envy that...\n\nA: You can probably get what you want by creating a Windows layout with the Apple mapping. The tool for making such things is at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx \n", "Q: Boot Camp only detects two out of three monitors Setup: brand new MacBook Pro with Retina Display plus two 27\" Thunderbolt displays. So, three displays in total, which works like a charm in OS X.\nUnfortunately, when boot-camping into Windows 8.1, it detects only two of these: the one on the MacBook and the (first) external one:\n\nNote that interestingly, the devices plugged into the secondary external monitor still work - e.g. all three cameras are there.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: From http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154\n\n\n*\n\n*How many Apple Thunderbolt Displays can I use with a Mac in Windows 7 or 8 with Boot Camp?  \n\n*Most Mac computers can support one Thunderbolt display using Windows. The iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and Mac mini (Late 2014) can support two, and the Mac Pro (Late 2013) can support up to six.\n\n", "Q: Can you dictate Emoji on iOS? iOS (and presumably OS X) understands the underlying Unicode descriptions for Emoji icons. When reading iMessages back to you, Siri can use these descriptions to translate Emoji into words.\nFor example, Siri is able to describe all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n* is read aloud as \"happy face with open mouth\"\n\n*❤️ is \"red heart\"\n\n* is \"sushi\"\n\n* is read as \"poop\"\n\n\nIs there a way to do this in reverse? That is, when I dictate to Siri or keyboard Dictation, translate what I say into an Emoji? Something like:\n\nLet's go to the movies exclamation point emoji happy face with open mouth\n\nand iOS would dictate that as:\n\nLet's go to the movies! \n\nI've tried various command words but have not been able to find a way to do it. It may not be possible. Does anyone know for sure?\n\nA: No, you can't.\nBecause there is 2 different keyboard sets, what can't be mixed in one dictation process. That could be the same like you'll try to dictate on 2 different languages in one time. That's hard enough.\nBut... It's just now, and who knows what kind of updates we will get with new iOS versions and new devices.\nBy the way. You can use some common text emotions on english keyboard. At least one:\n:-)\nAll that you need to say, it's just: \"Smiley\".\nTwo more I know of the top of my head:\n:-(    =   'frowny' \n;-)   =   'winky' \n\nA: As of iOS 16, this is now possible. Using either Siri or Keyboard Dictation, you can say the Unicode name of the emoji followed by the word \"emoji\", and iOS will dictate that as the actual emoji instead of the words.\n\n*\n\n*\"red heart emoji\" dictactes as ❤️\n\n*\"sushi emoji\" dictactes as \n\n*\"poop emoji\" dictactes as \n\nAt the time of writing, longer emoji names, such as \"happy face with open mouth\", may not dictate properly and can choose the wrong emoji.\n\nA: Some of the emojis, which has ASCII version can be written via dictate. Say e.g. colon right parenthesis and it will turn to :) emoji. This is list for punctation dictation. You can dictate punctation in any other language too.\nYou have to say spacebar too at the beginning to separate it from the text.\n\nA: Using text replacement (General>>Keyboard>>Text Replacement>> you can type various key combos and get emoji characters.\nFor example you can type keys for:\nexclamation point right paren <> and get \nor\ncolon hyphen rt. paren  \nbut sadly, dictating these does not work.\n\nA: We have added support for emojis using dictation in our iOS app \nplease check our app \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speech-to-text-voice-to-text/id1160943124\nMore emojis will be included in the coming releases \nYou tube video : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0gTHtV-73k\nThanks\nP.S i have worked on this app \n", "Q: OS X Yosemite takes ages to restore I have bought MacBook Pro with OS X Yosemite two days ago. After I transferred my files through Windows sharing I come to know that Disk utility didn't install properly as it says damaged or incomplete. So I had to restore is as new. \nFirst time it took more than 8 hrs because I slept after 5 hrs of wait. \nThen again I had to repair because I didn't find iMovie, iPhoto etc because it was in purchased items in iTunes but it also take ages and also I stopped migration through apple app because of same problem, took ages. \nSo I was afraid if data was saved somewhere so I restored again. I started at 3pm and it's 6.46 and it's not even half of it and saying 33 hours left. I followed Youtube videos, they says their repair takes just half an hour! Need help in a detailed and easy way. What does it mean by boot? \n\nA: there might be a better solution (below), but a slow internet is a slow internet.  it will just be a less painful download.  read the steps to see what you think and if it works for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*so boot into the ailing os \n\n*if you don't have the yosemite installer, download  via the app store.  yes this might still be slow, but should be resumable and you can do other things while it goes.\n\n*download disk maker x, this is a prog that takes and osx installer app and makes an installer usb stick with the full os  on it.\n\n*run diskmaker x and get an 8 gb usb stick and point it to the yosemite installer.  be careful you choose the right disk to erase.\n\n*then just boot off the usb stick and it will install from the local installer files.\n\n\ni use this program and depend on it to make installers for various machines\n\nA: I would strongly advice you to visit the apple store for them to fix your Mac.\nBut if you insist doing it your self:\nTurn off your mac.\nHold the cmd and the r and turn the Mac on by pressing the power button. (keep holding the cmd+r.)\nNow you will get this:\n\nFirst Run the Disk Utility application to Repair your disk. (do not Erase anything).\nNext run the Reinstall OS X.\nIf you deleted the recovery for some reason, you need to use the Internet recovery to get it:\nImmediately after hearing the Mac boot chime, hold down Command+Option+R – if you see the Apple logo you waited too long and need to reboot and try again.\nYou should now have a working Yosemite after waiting minimum a hour or much more depending on you Internet speed.\nIf you have erased Apple applications like iTunes ect.. then follow this instructions how to get them back.

I use Firefox. \nIt first happened maybe a year ago when my son sent a little home video taken on iphone. There was this slow dirge-like repetitive music playing in the background--loudly, too, so that I couldn't hear the voices on the video. When I lower the volume, the background music also decreases, along with sound on the video.  \nThat continued for several months and happened for videos from the web as well. It then stopped for a couple of months and today it's back.  Watching SNL iconic episodes on Yahoo.\nI should add that this same tune plays continuously, whether a video is playing or not. So I keep the volume muted when just using the web.\n\nA: So, music always plays when you have web browser open, regardless of any videos?\nMaybe.. check if there are tabs open, try to close them one after other if you would find if one of those has background music. Chrome and some other browsers might show an icon indicating if a tab is playing music.\n", "Q: Making directories list first in terminal with `ls` Is it possible to make the default of Terminal such that when I use the ls command it lists the directories first and then the files?\nI figured out that this can be done by using coreutils and the command gls --group-directories-first, but I was wondering if there was an OS X native way to do this without coreutils.\n\nA: The short answer is no. The ls shipped with OSX is not the GNU ls therefore it doesn't have the same options. \nBut you can get a similar result with :\nls -al | sort -k1 -r\n\nPs: I agree that it's far from perfect :) \n", "Q: Two iPhones, buth synced but with different contacts I have two iPhones and I would like to have them nicely synced calendar and task, but to keep different contacts. One is an office phone and I would like not to have my private numbers etc. Currently, on my old phone I have mail + contacts synced with Google, and Calendars, Reminders on iCloud, same as on my MacBook Air.\nCan I sync some data but not all of it?\n\nA: Only way I can think is to set up as 2 [or more] groups - so the contacts are there but not in your 'current' list.  \nThat's how I logically separate my business from personal contacts.\nUncheck the groups you don't want to see on each phone\n         \n\nA: Sign up for a free iCloud account to store your private contacts. \nCalendars and tasks can be synchronized to both devices and only turn on contact syncing for the one device \n", "Q: Cannot download picture from iCloud Photo Library \nCannot Download Photo.\n  There was an error downloading this photo from your iCloud Photo Library. Please try again later.\n\nWhat does this mean?  It happens all the time.\n\nA: I have experienced the 'error downloading try again later message' of my iCloud photos, it has been quite a while since I could access full resolution photos, I only get blurry photos.\nHad no idea what was going on or how to fix the issue, by chance I have in my case.  I only had the 5GB storage option and I kept getting messages to upgrade the amount of storage,  I chose to $1.48 a month option 50GB.\nStraight away the iCloud was uploading over 900 photos which made me realise why I was getting errors accessing my iCloud photos, they weren't there yet, only the low res thumbnails. All the issues I had are gone I just had to have larger storage and then allow the photos to upload. In all cases make sure and check you allow time for uploading.\nThe conclusion I come to is that if I get close to storage capacity iCloud stops uploading and all I see are the thumbnails photos which are not my full resolution iCloud photos.\nAll is good now.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I worked with the Apple engineers. Here was their answer. I deleted Clean My Mac 3 and it now works perfectly!\nFrom Apple:\nEngineering has noted that you may be using a 3rd party cleaner application which could be contributing to the issue. These apps are like CleanMyMac3 or Dr. Cleaner. If you are using these, please remove them and see if the issue goes away.\n", "Q: PHP version shown in command line differs from phpinfo(); in localhost:8000 I started my OS X PHP test server by typing\nphp -S localhost:8000\n\nI updated my PHP on OS X to 5.6 and when I check the version through the command line by typing:\nphp -v\n\nIt tells me that I have \"PHP 5.6.5\"\nWhen I start my PHP test server and look at the index.php file that has the phpinfo(); function, it tells me that I still have version 5.5.14 that comes with OS X.\nWhat can I do to get my PHP version on localhost:8000 to reflect that change?\n\nA: The new version of PHP needs to be in your $PATH and the path to the new version of php needs to be listed before /usr/bin. If the new version of php (the executable) is installed in /usr/local/bin/ you should be in good shape, otherwise you need to either  link the new php executable there (ln -s /path/to/newphp /usr/local/bin/php) or add it's location to your $PATH (export PATH=/path/to/newphp:\"${PATH}\") (<- add this to your ~/.bash_profile).\nOne other possibility to check... is the new version of php named php? It's possible that it will be named something like php5 or some such thing. If so you'll need to create a a link or use that name on the command line.\n", "Q: Can I move my logic board between different models of MacBook Air? If I take out my logic board in my MacBook Air 2011 11-inch i5 2 GB RAM and put in a MacBook Air 2011 11-inch i7 4 GB RAM, will it work? If not why?\n\nA: Yes, it will work.\nThe only thing you need to understand is that logic board is a determinative component in a MacBook and all the other parts (like flash drive, Wi-Fi module, etc.) just connected to it. But all of them are completely changeable.\nSo if you got two MacBook Air 11\" 2011 you can interchange their parts in any order you want.\nJust don't forget to use credible disassemble guide.

I'm trying to help a sight impaired and somewhat physically impaired person. They have an assistant that uses the Macbook Pro while he watches on an external monitor.\nThe only thing is that for the sight impaired person to see what is going on while the assistant is working the resolution (mirrored) is so low, meaning bigger fonts, that it makes it difficult for the assistant to work on the Macbook Pro in that environment.\nWhat can we do to remedy this?  Is there any software to make a mirrored external display bigger than the computer?\n\nA: No, what you're asking for doesn't even make sense. If you want the display to be mirrored, then what's on the external display has to be exactly the same as what's on the internal display. What you need is a new external display with a larger physical screen size.\n", "Q: IPad mini MD531LL/A and MD528LL/A What is the difference between Apple iPad mini MD531LL/A and MD528LL/A I want to purchase a new iPad and I don't know what this means is there a difference between the two?\n\nA: The part numbers you refer to are not actual model numbers, but indicate which country the part would be sold through and hence the pricing and warranty country of origin.\nMD531LL/A appears to be the original iPad mini (Late 2012) Model: A1432 WiFi only, white, 16 GB with resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels and an 2.4 GHz Apple A5 CPU.

I get a ton of spam every day and it makes me crazy that to mark it a spam or delete it I have to select the email, which opens it and loads all its images.\nWe all know spam emails contain distant images that are used for tracking, and opening the email is bad as it marks my email address \"active\" to spammers.\nMany email clients have an option to prevent loading external images by default, is there a way to do that with Mail.app?\n\nA: Mail.app > Preferences > Viewing > uncheck \"Load remote content in messages\"\n\nYou will then have this banner at the top of each message that contains remote content (just in case you do want to see the images):\n\nAside: I still see the occasional image in a message when looking through my spam folder. As best I can tell when I \"view raw source\" the spammers are including the image in the message text itself (there is a large block of text that looks like gibberish to me), but I'm not an expert on what is going on there. It might just be a bug in this feature.\n", "Q: Can you scan a document directly, instead of an overview scan first? It honestly really annoys me that every time I have to scan a document it requires me to do an overview scan. Isn't there a way to skip that part if you just want to scan A4 color/B&W using Image Capture on OS X. \nI've got a Canon MG5300 printer, although this is irrelevant as an overview scan is required on every printer.\nIf this can't be accomplished natively, a (great) third party app would be sufficient.\n\nA: You may be able to configure the scanner so that pressing the button on the console automatically sends the image data to a folder on your computer, without going through Image Capture.  \nAnother option, since you asked about third-party apps, is Vue Scan which is well-supported, and can scan without first doing a preview.\n(edit to add) yet another third-party app would be Paperless, which while technically is more of an archiving solution, it also will scan directly to its library without a preview. \n", "Q: Yosemite Spotlight Calculator suddenly stopped working I use Spotlight's Calculator feature occasionally, but I've noticed that it has stopped working recently.

So i want to be able to listen to some music files in a given folder (be it a complete album or just a collection of various songs) and once i'm done listening and close iTunes i want  all the files that i just listened to be gone from iTunes library.\nI want to be able to do it with iTunes, because I can control iTunes with apple remote and with alfred remote.\nAnd if it is not possible, maybe there is a workaround to achieve similar results? \n\nA: http://www.macworld.com/article/1049828/listenonly.html\nmay be out of date of course ... this link takes you to an article that seemingly explains how to do what the OP requires ...\n\nMake sure you can see the iTunes window, specifically the Source\n  column, along with the song you wish to listen to. Hold down the\n  Option key and drag the song file into an empty spot in the Source\n  column. iTunes will create a new playlist containing the dragged song,\n  but it will not add it to the library. When you’re done listening,\n  just delete the playlist. The original file will be untouched, and\n  once the playlist entry is gone, iTunes will no longer be aware of the\n  song, either.\n\n\nA: As you might have feared based upon the countless other disappointing Apple-related answers, the answer to your question is \"You can't\". You cannot play a file in iTunes without adding it to your library as well. Moreover, a converted version of your file is generated and copied into your iTunes library folder.\nSeeing as how you have Alfred working for you, and are otherwise willing to consider workarounds, I would suggest these potential [partial] workarounds: \n\n\n*\n\n*Associate each desired file type with a batch process to stream the desired audio through a third-party podcasting application to a specific address, and launch iTunes with the proper arguments to play the streaming audio from the appropriate address.\n\n*Associate each desired file type with a batch process that modifies the file before launching iTunes, so that, once another partial solution is found, all files launched in such a way are easier to target programmatically, eg:\n-- prepend or append some distinctive string to the filename\n-- for mp3s, modify some rarely-used ID3 tag value\n\n*Deleting the converted file that iTunes automatically creates when adding audio files to its library. (Obtaining the exact name with no margin for error may prove challenging however, nor will it remove the file's entry in any external library inventory file if there is one.)\n\n*Settle for programming some process to merely uncheck the box in iTunes next to the file, which will prevent it from being played unless you explicitly ask for it to be played. (This will not stop the file from being synced to your iPhone or iPod though, and I am not sure if its unchecked nature on your computer will prevent it from being shuffled in on your iPod.)\n(Also keep in mind that Automator (included with OS X in the Utilities Application folder), particularly its \"Watch Me Do\" feature, may offer some key functionality in creating executable shortcuts to actions you take manually, which may in deed provide an important part of the solution to your endeavor.)  \n\nA: \nI want to be able to do it with iTunes, because I can control iTunes with apple remote and with alfred remote. And if it is not possible, maybe there is a workaround to achieve similar results?\n\nVLC, the Media Player is a well known media player for multiple operating systems, and can do what you want. It can be used as a simple media player to play a folder of mp3s, can be controlled by an Apple Remote (The physical IR remote), has multiple Alfred2 workflows, as well as native remote control abilities, with plenty of iOS/Android remote apps.\n", "Q: Late 2008 Apple Aluminium MacBook complete reinstall I have a pretty  old Aluminum Macbook (late 2008).

Is there a way to install Yosemite directly??\n\nA: If you have a spare 8GB (or bigger) USB drive (or an external hard drive, or even an unused partition on your internal hard drive), you can download the Yosemite installer from the App Store and use it to create a bootable Yosemite installer. Here are Apple's detailed instructions for doing so.\n", "Q: Mac Won't Boot. Help needed I use top-notch MBPRO15 Late 2011 with the latest OSX and all the recent updates installed.

When installing a new app, and even though i have space left in my home screen, why does it create a new screen and create the icon there?\nIs there any configuration to, when installing a new app, the icon be created to fill the space in already created screens? \n\nA: New apps are never installed to the first screen.  Instead, they are put in the first open space available from the second screen onward.  If there is no open space for the app, then a new screen is created.\nThis does seem like something that could easily be turned into a preference; and, there may be a jailbreak setting already.

Is it possible to release an update to an iOS app on iTunes Connect only to certain countries, while the app has been available worldwide?

How can others on my network view the page that I'm hosting? \n\nA: The easiest method is to find the IP address assigned to your computer by your local network. This is found in the Network section of System Preferences. Other people can access your local webserver by typing that IP address into their browser.\n\nA: Go into Terminal and run hostname. If your web server is running on a non-standard port (you'd access it by, for example, localhost:8000), you'll need to use that port when connecting to it, but otherwise you should be able to just type in e.g. myhostname.local.\nIf this works on your computer but not another one on the same network, it means your network is set up to prohibit connections like the one you're looking for, and you'll have to look at your router for a way to disable it.\n", "Q: MAIL attachments turn to zero kb i have configured my Google APP email account on my new MACbook Pro (OS x 10.9.4). \nit was working fine for couple of days but now any attachment that i try to save it get save with ZERO size. \nNote: this problem is only with Encrypted Folders. \nif i download the save attachment to unencrypted folder, there is no problem encrypted\n\nA: Google APP email uses Google designed Encryption.\nTo set it up you need to use the Google Apps Message Encryption Quick Start Guide.\nFor the Attachment settings see the Google instructions  Attachment compliance setting\nBasically what it means is you have to tell Google APP how to handle the attachments.\nTo configure Attachment compliance settings for your domain or organizational unit:\nSign in to the Google Admin console.\nFrom the dashboard, go to Apps > Google Apps > Gmail > Advanced settings.\nIn the Organizations section, highlight your domain or the organizational unit for which you want to configure settings (see Configure advanced settings for Gmail for more details).\nScroll down to the Attachment compliance section:\n    If the setting's status is Not configured yet, click Configure (the \"Add setting\" dialog box displays).\n    If the setting's status is Locally applied, click Edit to edit an existing setting (the \"Edit setting\" dialog box displays), or click Add another to add a new setting (the \"Add setting\" dialog box displays).\n    If the setting’s status is Inherited, click View to view the inherited setting, or click Add another to add a new setting (the \"Add setting\" dialog box displays).\nWhen you're finished with your changes, click Add setting or Save to close the dialog box. \n\n", "Q: Recover photos from the iTunes backup of a dead iPhone My wife's iPhone 4 just died: it won't turn on and doesn't charge.

The other two pin plug in and USB plug in only allows one to work at a time. Is it possible for both of us to watch a movie using separate headphones on MacBook Air??\n\nA: You need a Y cable splitter to connect 2 headsets.\nMost come with single audio control but there are some with dual audio volume. If you already have audio volume control on each headset then no problem.\nSince you have the headsets already with different plugs you will have to get appropriate cable splitter for that.\nI did some search for you.\nFirst the USB male to 2x Female splitter like this.\nOne you use for your USB Head set.\nFor the second headset you need another adapter like this.\nThose do not have Volume adjustment, so hope there is no problem with that :).\n", "Q: IMessage not activating and can't select number to receive I got a new SIM card and now I message is not working.

Someone in US is sending 25 dollars as a gift to me in Ireland, how would I know when I recieve it? And can it be done in the first place?\n\nA: Apple Store Gift Cards can only be redeemed in the country of purchase.\nTo make iTunes purchases, you must use the store for the country you are physically located in. (You might be able to use a different Country store front, however it is a TOS violation you you can eventually have problems with your account); \nTo make iTunes purchases, you must have an iTunes account for that country store.\nTo make an account for that country store,\n- you must have an iTunes Gift Card specific to that country and and a mailing address in that country.\n- Or you must have a credit card issued from a bank in that country and a billing address in that country.\nhttp://store.apple.com/ie/help/gifting\nI hope that it helps a litlle. \n\nA: You would need a US iTunes store account to redeem it.

I only want them on my iPhone.\nIf I do the 'Delete account' thing as advised in one video, I am worried iMessage might not work on my iPhone either.\n\nA: You can do either. \nDisabling your Apple ID in iMessage will allow you to quickly re-enable it if you choose to use it on your Mac at a later time. \nDeleting your iMessage/Apple ID account from iMessage preferences on your Mac will not affect iMessage on your iPhone.

The AirPort in this particular room is transmitting at a higher power than needed, and its bleeding onto some areas where its unwanted.

The button doesn't respond. The button hasn't responded in months. What can I do to turn on wi-fi and how do I get the button to respond? Did I accidentally click something somewhere that makes the Wi-fi button never respond?\n\nA: Simply don't use wi-fi to backup. Use a USB cable. Even if wi-fi backup is enabled, you can always plug your iPhone into your computer and initiate a backup via USB.

There is no \"Invite People\" link/button...\nWhat setting do I need to change? Yes, I've got iCloud setup. Do I have to upgrade to the new iCloud storage? \nEdit: more details: iPhone 5s. iOS 8. I think it's maybe because I have zero contacts in iCloud?\nEdit: more details: When I create a new shared album, everything seems fine. I can add people to share with, or even delete the album. But the original album that prompted me to ask this question does not allow me to either add people to share with, nor does it allow me to delete the album. Something is special about it. Should all albums be equivalent, or is there a special use case for special albums that can't be shared nor deleted? The album name is \"Family\". I suppose the answer to my conundrum is that this album is specifically tied to people I add to my \"Family\". Not sure exactly how to do this but I suppose they also have to have iDevices. \n\nA: I had this problem on an albums other than the Family album on a MacBook Air. It turned out to that the \"To:\" line was hidden whenever Photos.app was running on an external display. When I put Photos back on the laptop screen the control would re-appear.\n\nA: I can invite anyone to my shared albums whether they have AppleID or not just by typing their SMS or email address into the invite field.\nI've seen the app freeze, so power off your iPhone and then try going back into Photos as soon as it restarts. If that doesn't work, post a screen shot of your attempt and I'll see if something else makes sense to try.\n\nA: Per your second edit, it is indeed a special folder created by family sharing.\n\nThe whole family can contribute to the family photo album.\nNow collecting and sharing family memories is easier and more fun.\n  When Family Sharing is turned on, a shared album is set up\n  automatically in the Photos app on all family members’ devices. Then\n  everyone can add photos, videos, and comments to the album and be\n  notified when something new is added. You can add or view photos and\n  videos from iPhoto on your Mac, and from Photos on your iPhone, iPad,\n  or iPod touch with iOS 7 or later.\n\n\nA: If it is titled Family, IOS only lets you add people who is listed under \"Family Sharing\" (settings>icloud>family>'Add Family member'). If you don't want to share everything you purchase from the App Store or iTunes store (which is what family sharing is all about), then create a new shared album with a new name.

As far as I can tell, this command works, and I can check the result using sudo xcode-select -p. Further, I have CLTs installed in /usr/bin, so that e.g., which g++ shows /usr/bin/g++. Still, if I switch to the older Xcode version, the package won't compile. Interestingly, find below the output of g++ -v for the two different versions of Xcode:\nFor Xcode 6.1.1:\ng++ -v\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.56) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin14.1.0\nThread model: posix\n\nFor Xcode 4.6.3:\ng++ -v\ncouldn't understand kern.osversion `14.1.0'\nUsing built-in specs.\nTarget: i686-apple-darwin11\nConfigured with: /private/var/tmp/llvmgcc42/llvmgcc42-2336.11~182/src/configure --disable-checking --enable-werror --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2 --mandir=/share/man --enable-languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-prefix=llvm- --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/$/-4.2/ --with-slibdir=/usr/lib --build=i686-apple-darwin11 --enable-llvm=/private/var/tmp/llvmgcc42/llvmgcc42-2336.11~182/dst-llvmCore/Developer/usr/local --program-prefix=i686-apple-darwin11- --host=x86_64-apple-darwin11 --target=i686-apple-darwin11 --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nThread model: posix\ngcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)\n\nSo my questions are:\nWhat does the message couldn't understand kern.osversion 14.1.0 refer to? Is this something I should be worried about?\nWhy does it continue to show\n--prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2\n\nin the output of g++ -v after selecting the older version, pointing to the new Xcode package, even though I changed the Xcode path using sudo xcode-select -s PATH?\nWhat is your preferred way of having multiple versions of Xcode, each with their own set of CLTs, installed at the same time?\nIt'd be great if someone could clear things up.\n\nA: You are on to the best way to manage things.\nHave your build script call xcode-select to choose the compiler and headers you prefer each project to compile against. I've not had any issues having three versions of Xcode running thusly.

There's a few apps that keep prompting me for incoming network connections, which I prefer to deny, but whenever I open these programs, I'm re-prompted to Allow/Deny incoming network connections for them.\nIs there a way to permanently Deny an application so that I am no longer prompted?\n(I'm currently using Yosemite)\n\nA: No not really, when you open a program whatever core process it calls into action are run every time. One of which will, in your case, checks on the various permissions it has to make or accept outgoing/incoming connections. The act of double clicking and opening the application (even after choosing to deny such privileges) will overwrite/trash your past decisions to DENY incoming/outgoing connections simply because you gave it permission to open (not when you ACCEPT though - in this case any previously accepting connections will not continue to ask for your permission).\nUnless there is a setting within the application's \"Preferences\" or you change some code within the \"Contents\" of its bundle then it is highly likely that it will prompt you every time.\nBTW these permissions requests are meant to alert and pop up every time to keep users from making \"permanent decisions\" (AKA turning off popup notification and permission requests). Without the popup requests, switching permissions settings back and forth would become a much more difficult task and more than likely need the help of a genius bar rep to switch them back and forth (for the not-so-savvy users at least).\n", "Q: Battery issue - backup problem? I recently bought a new iPhone 6, because my iPhone 5 had some weird battery issues: when I was on 3G or 4G, the battery would literally go down from 50% to 10% in like 10 minutes. On the Wi-Fi, it was pretty OK. \nRight now, with my new Phone, I was expecting way better battery results. But weirdly enough, it's still pretty bad, though the phone is new. \nI went to the Apple Store a couple of weeks back with my iPhone 5 and the guy told me that it may be a software issue (related to my backup, which I put on my iPhone 6) and not a hardware issue (don't worry I didn't buy the new iPhone just because of that).\nAnyways, I was wondering if that could be a logical explanation?\nAnd then, I would like to try completely factory restoring my phone to check but there are some settings like the wifi passwords, etc. that I'd like to keep...how can I transfer them without the backup?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: You should first make a full backup and restore the new iPhone to factory default. Don't worry about your settings, it's stored in the backup so you can place it back if you miss something. Or you could try this fix on the iPhone 5 first.\nProblem resolved?\nIf the problem is gone you shouldn't place the back-up back, as something might be damaged inside. You can now manually download every app and add the Wi-Fi settings.\nUnfortunately: You cannot put any part of your back-up back, as it's damaged somehow.\nPlease\nPlease don't worry about Wi-Fi settings. You can always ask everyone for their passwords (at least in my circles) they're given out pretty easily. You rather have a fully functional phone and battery rather than all Wi-fi passwords, don't you?\nPlease note I didn't add an answer to when restoring to clean default does not fix your issue.\n", "Q: Google Maps on iPhone wont update map orientation as I cycle Goole Maps on my iPhone have has stopped changing the orientation of the map in cycling mode. \nThe first image is a screengrab of Apple's maps.

Is there anyway to force/change/reset the profile image that shows up for an Artist in iTunes?\n\nA: If you've added custom artwork to an Artist, it will replace the individual Album Artwork that iTunes had previously set.\nTo clear it, you need to clear each affected album - which can be done as a bulk selection, using shift/click to select all its tracks [but doesn't work if you select more than one Album]\nthen  \n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd/I to Get Info  \n\n*Artwork Tab  \n\n*Select the Custom picture  \n\n*Delete or Backspace  \n\n*OK  \n\n*File Menu > Library > Get Album Artwork\nYou can do the last step once only, after resetting all the tracks you need to clear the Custom picture from.\n\n\nA: No, when there are artist photos, they are downloaded from the iTunes Store.

The notification center clearly posts its alerts visible on my screen faster than my iPhone alerts me. \nDoes the path of my incoming texts change when I have the Messages.app configured to sync with my phone or does the Messages.app just alert faster, or is something else going on? \n\nA: As you are active on your compy, it gives you first opportunity to answer from there. Only if you don't bring Messages to the front does it then ping the phone.\nPersonally, I like it - I can type a heck of a lot faster with 8 fingers than 2 thumbs ;)\n& now it can do SMS too, fabulous.\nBTW, if you don't like it, I've never seen any option to change that behaviour. It may auto-switch if you start answering on the phone instead, but I haven't specifically checked for if it does that.\n\nA: I believe the delay is intentional, in order to give you a chance to answer the message from your computer first before your phone alerts you with the same message.\nNote that if a message comes in and you answer it from your computer right away, your phone will never alert you (even though if you check the phone later, the message will be there in your history).\n", "Q: Using Launchbar to make Popclip appear PopClip is a Mac app that adds the iOS functionality of a bunch of options showing up above selected text. PopClip automatically appears every time I select text, and that's annoying, so I want to trigger it from the keyboard instead. I'm trying to set up Launchbar to launch an Applescript to cause PopClip to appear next to selected text. \nThe Applescript I'm using is tell application \"PopClip\" to appear. However, when I press ↩ with the text selected in Mail and \"Show Pop Clip.scpt\" selected in Launchbar, nothing happens. And when I press ⇥ as Obdev (the Launchbar developer) recommends here, I don't see an option to \"Run\" as they suggest. \nHow can I use Launchbar to make Popclip appear?\n\nA: With Launchbar you can run scripts in the background by pressing Option+Return, rather than just Return. This works for me, whereas Return by itself did not. \n", "Q: Install MS Office (home and student edition) on more than one Mac?

After installing it in the Cydia you can assign Actions to the Events. For example you can assign this workflow:\nAnywhere > Build > Scheduled > Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat 12:00 AM > Save > Done\n\nNow select:\n12:00 AM > Lock Device\n\nAlthough this workflow just locked your device and does not restrict the usage after the 12:00AM, it acts like an alarm.\nThe other tweaks that can do the restriction are: AppCap, Parental Controls.\n", "Q: How to access GPS data from command line on jailbroken iPhone Are there any binaries available via the command line to get information  from the GPS on a jail broken iPhone? I've searched through Cydia and haven't found anything, but I wouldn't imagine this would be something brand new that hasn't been developed.\nHas anyone come across anything that can do this?\n\nA: I've come along something very similar a while ago but there was no package needed. I'll try my best to explain how it worked. Firstly, an iTunes backup is required. Next, you will need to access that backup on your computer. There was a program for OS X (and probably for Windows too) that could read these backups. In the backup, there is GPS data that can be accessed but is useless without the other program. It is called iPhone Tracker. Also, another option that I have not tried is this. Other than these two methods, I am not sure of any other methods. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Making music and photos available to Apple TV I have a double story house with the modem upstairs and an Apple TV downstairs. I also have a USB hard drive with an iTunes library and iPhoto library on it. At the moment every time I want to use the libraries I have to plug my USB drive into my MacBook.\nI've recently discovered that my modem has a USB port on it, and I can plug my USB hard drive into that. Can I plug my hard drive into that port and make the libraries accessible to both my MacBook and Apple TV?\nIf possible I don't want to have to keep my MacBook turned on all the time. I.e., it would be nice to just have the USB hard drive plugged into the modem and access my library on the Apple TV without my MacBook being turned on.\nIn researching this answer I've read a lot about Apple's AirPort Extreme and how it can do something like that. But unless that's my only option I would rather not spend an extra $200 if I don't have to.\n\nA: This is similar to another recent question: Is Apple TV intelligent enough to stream directly from a NAS?\nAs @tubedogg says, you need iTunes running on a Mac/PC in your network to share local files.  You can only remove this requirement if you buy/stream everything from the iTunes store.\nUnless you hack your ATV.\nYou can run something like PlexConnect on it to stream content from a local Plex server, but again you need a Mac/PC running a Plex server, so it's not that different than requiring a Mac/PC running iTunes.\nI think there might be an XBMC hack (for ATV2 only) that will allow you to stream from a NAS/UPnP device, which might work with your modem's USB port, but I doubt it will work from the AE's USB port.  The AE's USB port is best used for a Time Machine drive, which is a great backup strategy, but off-topic.\nSo, if you haven't bought everything from the iTunes Store (or haven't used iTunes Match to make a copy of all your music available to you from the \"cloud\"), you do need to keep a Mac/PC running iTunes to access your personal content, regardless of where your USB drive is plugged into.\n\nA: Home Sharing functionality operates through iTunes itself. If iTunes isn't running (even if the MacBook is), your iTunes library isn't available on the Apple TV. So plugging the hard drive into the modem won't do anything.\nNote the above is answering your question about your current setup. Purchasing an Airport router would change this answer, but you asked if your current setup would allow functionality like the Airport allows.\n", "Q: How do I prevent my mac's wifi from ever (not just once) seeing a particular wifi network? So here is my dilemma- I'm addicted to the internet and I don't want to have the option of using it in my home except for particular times. \nOn my own network, I plan to change the password to something long and unmemorizable and write it down and leave it somewhere else (say the coffee shop) /tell it to a friend etc so that I can have the option of using it- then tell my key chain to forget the network's password. Problem solved!\nThe only issue is that my upstairs neighbors have a network and I know the password! If only I could delete it from the keychain in my head, but I can't. I can ask them to change the password, and will, but it's not their problem and I feel silly doing so. Plus even if they do it'll take them forever.. \nSo my question is: Is there a way to prevent my computer from using a particular network, forever - so that my computer sees it and automatically ignores it? \nAny help much appreciated!\n\nA: What about something even easier? There's a great app for OS X called Concentrate that will block distractions for you for periods of time. In particular it'll block your access to apps when you want to focus so you can stop surfing Ask Different when you should be studying. Have it block Chrome, Safari and Firefox and any other apps you find distracting and you might find that's easier than trying to have WiFi but not have your computer connect to it.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Network, and click on Advanced. Go to the Wi-Fi tab (if you're not there by default), scroll through the list of networks until you find the one you want to forget, select it, and then click the minus sign at the lower left of the list of networks.\n", "Q: Making a default window size and preview size for folders on a Mac I work for a photography company and we have just switched to Mac for showing our photos directly to our clients when they come to our booth. The change to Mac has changed how we show our photos. We are like a roller coaster ride where it takes your photo and you walk up to a booth to view them.\nOur problem is that I want to show them in a folder with a size just below fullscreen and in cover flow (with a BIG preview size). The trouble is that customers are the ones who are using them and so they will close to the window. I have 4 Macs open to customers at a time with hundreds of viewers in a weekend.\nWhen I reopen the folder it has been saved in cover flow but the folder window is smaller (nowhere near fullscreen) and the size of the preview to folder ratio is very small for the preview size I want (again this is in cover flow). \nI want to be able to change this default sizing like I can for cover flow always defaulting. I know it would just take 10 seconds each time to resize, but a year from now that will add up to hours.\nAlso, what would be even better is if they close the window that it will automatically reopen it or reopen a specific window?\nThis is not in the program \"preview\". This is when I am viewing folders (read only) and they need to be viewed well in cover flow.\n\nA: One way of doing that is to use the \"Use as Default\" in the View Options after you have adjusted the size.\nGo to View in Menu bar then select show View Options.\nNow adjust the size to your liking then click Use as Defaults.\n\n\nA: You can use an AppleScript to automate reopening the Finder window when it is closed. To implement this:\nOpen Script Editor (in the Applications > Utilities folder).

Copy and paste the following path into the small box that appears:\n~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts\n\nName the file Reopen Finder Window.scpt and click Save.\nCopy this file onto all of the computers where you want this to work, in the same folder. (The ~ character means the current user's home folder, so this path will work on each computer correctly without changing it.)\nThe following steps need to be done on each computer where you want this to function.\nIn Finder, find the folder you want to always open, and go up to its parent folder. Right-click on the folder you want to always open, highlight Services at the bottom, click Folder Actions Setup... and a new window will appear.\nIn the new window, find Reopen Finder Window in the list, click on it, and choose Attach. Close this window by clicking the red X in the upper-left corner.\nNow, anytime the Finder window showing the contents of that folder is closed, it will automatically reopen.\nWe can also modify the script to ensure the window is sized correctly every time, but I would need to know what resolution you are using to do this. (Go to the website What is my screen resolution for a quick check of this, if you do not know what it is.)\n\nA: To get a smaller New Document window in Fireworks, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new document window.\n\n*Go to Fireworks/Preferences/General: and under Document, deselect \"Open new document in tabs\". Under Window, also deselect \"Use Applicatioan Frame\".\n\n*Resize the window to what you want, then under Window, select \"Use Application Frame\".

While I was upgrading my early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro's HDD to an SSD by the instructions on iFixit, I think I broke my camera cable. When I tried to talk to my friends on Google Hangouts later that day, my computer didn't detect the camera. There wasn't a \"no signal\" error or anything; the computer just had no idea that the camera exists (but for the record, the microphone still works fine). That was a few months ago, and the camera's never come back since then.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to definitively prove that the issue is that I broke the camera cable with an overzealous pull? If it does happen to be a software issue despite all my troubleshooting efforts till now, I'd very much like to know.\n\n*Assuming the issue is that the cable broke near the socket, what's the least dangerous way to fix it?\n\nA: There is a wonderful site \"ifixit\" that has answers to that question.\n\nThe camera cable socket is very fragile. Do not apply any upward force\n  to this socket, as it may break off the logic board.

How do I fix this? I'm trying to delete the program it came from but it says that it's 'in use', but when I pull up the task manager all that shows up are finder and Microsoft Word. Any word on how I can delete the covert adware/malware?\n\nA: So after downloading Vuze a while back, I wound up with api.mybrowserbar redirects and a bunch of stuff pointing at some thing called Spigot, deterministically finger banging my bandwidth and internet experience in general.\nSorry, this assumes some knowledge of the command line and file structures.\nThe solution, grep is your friend.\nOpen Terminal and navigate to /Users/YOUR_COMPUTER_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome\nYOUR_COMPUTER_USERNAME must of course be replaced with your computer username, you can retrieve it by running the whoami command in your terminal.\ngrep -rnw '.' -e 'spigot'\nand\ngrep -rnw '.' -e 'api.mybrowserbar'\nget in there and remove that shit.\nIn the most annoying case, their genius software made itself the default restart page for whenever chrome unexpectedly crashes.

Of the units that reach out to the web, the Mac Pro, Mac Mini, or MacBook Pro 17, has NOT been affected. *Not going to give hardware specs as I'd be on here all day. This has only affected a MacBook Pro 15(2013 model) via Google Chrome. \nPart of my job is finding and ending problems such as this, so I've done a bit of research on the issue and this is what I have come up with, I certainly hope it helps someone:\nIn this case, certain Chrome 'Extensions' appear to worm there way into the Extensions list. Heres a small list of extensions that install without user consent: \"Amazon Shopping Assistant by Spigot\", \"Domain Error Assistant\", \"Ebay Shopping Assistant by Spigot\" and \"Slick Savings.\" In my case, I narrowing my logs down to an extension called \"domain error assistant\" being the first installed without user consent. The yahoo search engine appeared relentlessly even after all browser cache was deleted.\nMy Fix? Save bookmarks, etc. Trash ALL extensions, Remove Chrome, reinstall Chrome. Its been good for over a month now.\nGood Luck!  \n\nA: I had the same problem in Safari using Mac OS, and I found the problem was caused an extension called Any Search that got installed in the browser when installing some other app. I removed it, and it solved the problem.\n\nA: I had a similar issue and it was resolved once I removed the \"Emoji keyboard\" Chrome extension. \n(My problem was limited to Chrome, I think)\n\nA: Go to Activity Monitor, and you'll see a list of all the tasks your computer is running. Find the program that the adware came from, select it,  and click the Quit button in the top left corner of Activity Monitor's toolbar (the button with an octagon with an X in it, not the red \"close window\" button). That should stop the program so you can delete it.\n\nA: Check your extensions for anything by Spigot and either run AdwareMedic or follow the instructions on the site that hosts AdwareMedic. Or use Apple's plagiarized article.\n\nA: I'm aware that this thread is a little bit old, but I just faced the same problem after having installed Vuze. \nWhat I did was delete an extension called \"Quick Browse\", and now everything seems to be back to normal. \nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I ended up using the terminal to delete it, and whatever it is, hopefully is gone (it no longer hijacks my browsers).\nEDIT: I used the commands rm -rf to delete the original file.\n\nA: I have had the same problem and I discovered a program that had piggybacked into my system called Yahoo Search Set.  Uninstalling that program, restarting the computer, and then manually removing the Yahoo Search URL from my homepage setting did the trick.  I have found references to another software called \"Spigot\" that may do the same thing.  Go to \"Uninstall Programs\" in your control panel and look the list over.  If you see either of these listed, uninstall them.  If they are not there, look for any other program listed that you are not familiar with.  Check those programs out by doing search on \"what is\" plus the program name and you should find information about whether the program is legitimate.  If it is not something you want or need and not something that is part of another function like printer function software, consider uninstalling it. That is how I found and decided to uninstall Yahoo Search Set which cured my problem.\n", "Q: I have an iPad mini 2, with ios 7.2, can i manually upgrade to 8.1.2 and still jailbreak it? I just bought my wife an iPad mini 2, ( it was still factory sealed) it has 7.2 on it and I'd  like to know if I can still update it to 8.1.2 and jailbreak it. I know downgrading from 8.1.3 can no longer be done but what about upgrading from older firmware to 8.1.2? It's this still possible even if apple is no longer signing it?\nThanks,\nOcha\n\nA: No, you cannot. Apple is no longer signing the 8.1.2 update, as can be seen in the chart at The iPhone Wiki.\n\nEdit: The screenshot got partially cut-off, but the upshot is that all devices that support 8.1.2 were listed under the same item, and all stopped signing on 10 February 2015.\n", "Q: Difference between the M7 and M8 coprocessors? What's the difference between the M7 and M8 coprocessors? I've been unable to find a clear answer online. On the iPhone 6 webpage, Apple simply states:\n\nWhen you’re in motion, the M8 motion coprocessor continuously measures\n  data from the accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, and a new barometer.\n  This offloads work from the A8 chip for improved power efficiency. And\n  now those sensors do even more, measuring your steps, distance, and\n  elevation changes.\n\nIs the only difference the ability to track data from the new barometer?\n\nA: As you noted, the M8 coprocessor is able to collect data from the new barometer in the iPhone 6 series phones as well as the iPad Air 2, which provides a measure of relative elevation for floors climbed.\nWe may also speculate that it is more accurate and power-efficient, although whether accuracy improvements are up to the sensors or the M8 is hard to prove (software improvements would also come into play here, as CoreMotion attaches a confidence value to measurements, which could be tweaked in software).\nHowever, Phil Schiller raised another point during his presentation that many people seem to have missed: the M8 chip is now also able to recognize cycling activities. This new capability is reflected in the updated CoreMotion API, as detailed here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreMotion/Reference/CMMotionActivity_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/CMMotionActivity\nThe M7 only recognized stationary, walking, running, automotive, and unknown. The M8 adds the cycling property to the list.\nIt is worth mentioning that iOS 8 does not make use of this functionality, and that the iPhone 6 does not write cycling data to the Health app on its own. You will need a dedicated app for that.\n\nA: The M8 provides a cycling activity category as well as stairs ascended and descended. The M8 can also measure relative altitude using the barometer chip.\n\nA: As an end user, the difference is what device they are embedded. The barometer is additional data that might help with stairs and hill climbs, but I don't have good data on that living in the flat midwest portion of the US.\nI get measurably better quality step data from my iPhone 6 (M8) than I do from M7 class devices, so presumably it collects more data for the same (or less) energy usage or is otherwise superior in sensing motion and discerning foot falls from riding a bike or other vehicles.\nSpecifically, the error of over reporting is lessened. The M7 gave me more credit for more steps than I took whereas the M8 gives me less extra credit, but still over estimates my actual step count slightly.\nSince we can't obtain these devices in isolation - it's not really possible to reverse engineer the details of the chip implementations, but we can do empirical experiments and collect data about the same person moving with both devices attached to their body and compare the output of both systems. Also since iOS 8 runs on both hardware suites - the difference is likely how the firmware directs the devices to use power and the native abilities of the chipsets that causes differences in the data they generate.\n", "Q: How do I connect 2 iCloud accounts to a single iCloud Photo Library I am trying to have all the photos from both my iPhone and my wife's iPhone linked to the same iCloud Photo Library so from both of our devices we can have access to the same Photos without needing the same iCloud account on both devices.\nIs this at all possible or is there a workable work around that will get the same functionality?\n\nA: You need to have an iCloud id just for photos - Login on both devices using a (perhaps new) iCloud id which your photos will 'live' in. Turn off mail, contacts, calendars and reminders and notes on both devices for this shared iCloud id. So from now on, to apple's iCloud servers, it appears both iPhones are owned by the same \"person\".\nAfter this, set up your mail id on your iPhone and your wife's mail on hers so you have access to your individual email accounts (you can also active contacts, calendars and reminders for this account so they appear on your respective iPhones).\nNote: You will be sharing the same iCloud photo library, but also the same iCloud Safari passwords and wallet - but if you are sharing with one another all photos taken from your iPhones then this is (perhaps) a moot point...\n\nA: Simple answer - Family Sharing\nYou can both then share the same apps, books, music & photos.\n", "Q: About repairing permissions in the mac mini If one uses several different programs including the mac disk utility to repair permissions on the computer maybe 3 or 4 times in one day can this 'hurt' the computer or can one use these utility programs many times with impunity?\n\nA: You can run \"Repair Permissions\" as often as you want. All it does is accessing a lot of files/folders and comparing their permissions to a master list known to the OS. In theory this puts a bit more wear and tear on the hard drive (assuming no SSD), but in practice you will get bored of rerunning \"Repair Permissions\" every few minutes before any negative effects show up (unless the drive was defective already anyway).\nOTOH, if you need to run \"Repair Permissions\" every few hours because permissions get changed so often, you might have a problem worth looking into.\n", "Q: Reading RSS feeds in native iOS 8 If I click an RSS feed in Safari on iOS 8, ie. from this page, the Podcast app is mysteriously opened, showing the feed as if it were a Podcast. The feed cannot be read however.\nI would expect the feed to open in Safari itself, since it has the same \"Shared Links\" section as Safari on OS X. But there seems to be no way to use this section for reading RSS feeds.\nI can't even delete the Podcast app either, as it seems to be an integrated part of iOS now.\nSo how can I read RSS feeds using native iOS functionality (save from installing a third party RSS reader)?\n\nA: It is apparently not possible to subscribe to a feed unless the page is coded to include that feed as an alternative to viewing the page.\nIn other words, if I visit (just by way of example) Daily Mac Tips, I can click the Bookmark icon at the bottom of the Safari window, then the @ (Shared Links) tab, then Subscriptions at the bottom, then Add Current Site at the bottom. New stories from the RSS feed on this site will now appear in the Shared Links tab in safari. The fact that Safari knows about the RSS feed for this site is a result of the way the site is coded.\nHowever, there is no way to manually add an RSS feed to this list in iOS. So, from a page like you gave as an example, where there are links to various RSS feeds, the above steps don't work. The site is not coded to let Safari know about the RSS feed, because there are a couple dozen to choose from, and none of them are specific to the page you are viewing.\nYou can long-tap on an RSS feed link and copy it, then paste it into a third-party app of your choice, but there is no way to subscribe to it in Safari unless the site is set up as described above.\n(Regarding it opening the Podcasts app by default, Apple has apparently reassigned handling of feed URLs to the Podcasts app, presumably because they don't have an RSS reader and have removed manual subscriptions from Safari.)\n", "Q: Should I disable Virtual Memory on SSD in OS X Yosemite? Should I, or do I need to, disable memory swapping when my OS is installed on an SSD? I run OSX 10.10.2 with 16GB of memory. Currently, Activity Monitor reports I have 16GB of virtual memory allocated, with 0Bytes actually being used. 5,28GB of Memory is in use.\nI understand that it's beneficial for the longevity of as SSD to reduce the amount of write-actions to it, which leads me to believe it's also beneficial to not have a swap-file on that drive. If I really need one, can I move it to my internal HDD? If so: how?\n\nA: For how to do that, I recommend this excellent sophisticated answer: How can I move virtual memory swap files to a different drive or partition?\nBut keep in mind that your SSD does NOT wear out as bad as most youngsters tell you. In fact, I experience HDs breaking a lot more often than SSDs. Besides, your computer only swaps if it's really necessary as it comes with enormous memory access speed penalties. And even if it was: I'd prefer keeping the swap on the SSD rather than moving it to a slow HD. \nBut always keep in mind: Storage media are expendable parts.\n", "Q: How to Determine What's Using Filling GPU's Video Memory? I have a system with integrated graphics to which OS X has assigned 1.5gb (out of 16gb) of RAM, however iStat Menus is currently reporting this at around 95% full, even though I'm not currently running anything that should be making much of a demand of the GPU.\nOf course it's possible there's something I'm not aware of that has been using the GPU, but only restarting has completely cleared it. I was playing Civilisation V yesterday, but even while playing it didn't fill my video memory, and that was over 10 hours ago (my computer hasn't been asleep since then, as I'm still running through a large initial backup of a huge volume).\nI'm just wondering if there's an easy way to determine what's using up all this video memory, similar to using Activity Monitor to track main memory? If it happens again I'd like to figure out what's at fault so I can avoid the problem in future and/or report any memory leaks or similar issues.\n\nA: There is a tool available to check a lot of graphic card parameters: OpenGL Drive Monitors\nYou may download it at Apple developer. You need a developer account though. Search for \"Graphics Tools\" and then download \"Graphics Tools for Xcode - Xcode 6.1\". Open the .dmg and copy \"OpenGL Drive Monitors\" to your Application folder.\nYou can't track down graphic memory usage of individual apps though.\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: Will my device's location be shown in Find My iPhone if it is connected to iTunes? Two days ago I lost my iPhone 5s. It could have been stolen.\nI've reported it to my carrier and police yesterday as stolen.\nI got Find My iPhone enabled, but when I login to iCloud there is no information (the device is shown as offline). I hope someone will start my phone, therefore…\nIf the person who stole/found my iPhone will try to connect it to iTunes and try to restore the iPhone, will Find My iPhone show me the location of the phone? I'm a little scared because I found a way to disable activation called iCloud Bypass.\nIf it possible I will not find my phone, but if my iPhone sends me its location during the bypass process or even if someone will try to restore the device in iTunes, I will find a thief. Does anybody know anything about that Find My iPhone functionality?\n\nA: Set it to Lost Mode on https://www.icloud.com/#find \nIf anyone ever tries to reset the phone it will have to go online to activate.\nAt that point, Lost Mode will kick in [possibly with a location] \nThe phone is a brick to anyone else, without your login details. \nDon't erase it remotely, send a message to it, perhaps informing the current \"holder\" that it's locked & how to contact you or the police to report they \"found\" it.\nThieves are finally getting the message that stealing an iPhone is pointless.

I see the answer for printing from an iPad to a Windows enterprise, but I just want to print from an iPad Air to my home printer (HP Officejet Pro L7590) that is running on my network from a Windows desktop.  Is there a solution simpler than Presto?\n\nA: The L7590 does not provide Airprint capabilities and can 't be added.\nIf you run Windows you can try to enable AirPrint - like described here (I haven't tried it my self, because I'm running OS X, so I can't comment on how good it is): http://www.airprintactivation.com/ - then the printer(s) setup on your PC will be available in iOS\nIf you run OS X you can download a more less free AirPrint enabler: http://www.netputing.com/handyprint/ - then the printer(s) setup on your Mac will be available in iOS\n\nA: The HP Officejet Pro L7590 is not AirPrint enabled, however you can print to it using the HP ePrint app.\n", "Q: Sending MMS with WiFi only iPad Air When trying to send a picture to a non iMessage contact on my iPad Air (WiFi only) it says that MMS must be enabled. Am I not able to send MMS on WiFi only?\n\nA: That would be correct.\nIf you are trying to send a pic to your contact that is not on iMessages, then it would use the MMS system (the phone system) to deliver it.\nThat has little to do with WiFi but with how else should it deliver it without knowing the other persons WiFi connection. The iMessages would use the other person phone number as identification to deliver a MMS.\nIf you use any other communication system like Skype, Twitter, Facebook ..., both parties have to be on it, so the messages/pictures flow occurs using that app.\n", "Q: How to know when phone was last rebooted? Occasionally I get the message about TouchID needing my password after reboot. Problem is, I haven't been rebooting. So I'm concerned my phone is rebooting itself in my pocket without me knowing it. I want to know for sure if my phone is rebooting by itself, or if the TouchID message is just erroneous. How can I find out if my phone is rebooting?\niPhone 5s, iOS 8 (latest)\n\nA: There appears to be an app called \"System Status Lite\" that is capable of displaying the system uptime (which should be the time since the last reboot).

Once you have the app open in finder you can right click the name of the folder at the very top of the finder window that opened and it will show the path to the app. \nAlternatively you could right click the app in the finder window and click \"Get Info\" to show a panel like this with the path to the app:\n\n\nA: Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and look in the 'persistent-apps' array:\n    \n", "Q: Encrypt folder on Mac without dmg file so that the contents can expand in size I want to encrypt some folders on my Mac.\nI know there is a way of doing it by making a dmg file, but I also want to keep editing those folders. So I just want to encrypt that folder while being able to add more things in the encrypted folder.

I've finally figured out how to install Windows without any stray network connection errors or invalid .iso file errors, but I've run into a bit of an issue. The Windows partition doesn't have any drivers. Its' resolution is 640x320 and I don't even know if I can change that. I've downloaded the Boot Camp drivers for my machine (Late 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" with Retina Display) and I'd installed the Windows-run partition with those drivers in the .iso, but somehow none of those drivers were installed.\nI'd downloaded them again to my Macintosh HD partition, but I can't copy them to my Windows HD partition because of file system incompatibilities or whatever. At that point I'd decided to copy them to an NTFS flash drive, then copy them from that drive to my Windows HD partition, but I'm still not allowed to do that. I'm given the not-allowed cursor when I attempt to drag the drivers folder over. I'm pretty sure I can launch Setup.exe in Windows HD if I can figure out how to copy those files over and everything will be okay, but I can't figure out how to do that.\nOne last thing I'd tried (the first) was to connect to Ethernet via Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. This did not work and I'm assuming that's because I don't have an Ethernet driver, either. I couldn't even connect to the network.\nI've never been through so much trouble just to play a game from The Sims series. Why can't they hurry to the release of a Mac version? :(\nThanks for reading.\nEdit: Basically Boot Camp wouldn't allow me to create a bootable USB drive without some network error or claiming that I was trying to install from an iso which wasn't a Windows iso, when it was -- in fact -- a Windows iso. To avoid that I'd opened Microsoft's bootable USB creation tool (on my Windows-run server) to create the bootable USB drive on my flash drive. After that I'd copied the Boot Camp files over from the 'BootCamp5.1.5621' folder I'd downloaded from Apple's support site. I'd then chosen the following configuration in Boot Camp.\n\nAfter starting the operation my Mac had restarted and I was greeted with the 'Starting Windows' message. I'd installed Windows to the appropriate partition, then booted Windows to see that I didn't have any drivers at all.\nI know it doesn't make much sense, but that was the configuration and my Mac did boot the new Windows partition properly.\nEdit: I've found a workaround.\nI've used my Windows 7 VM within VirtualBox to copy the files over after creating a shared folder to /Volumes/Untitled (Untitled was my Windows HD). I'd copied the files from my OS X desktop (also had a shared folder between OS X and the VM for my OS X desktop) which was where I had the Boot Camp drivers, then copied them over to the Windows HD disk. Now I'm going to boot Windows again and try to launch Setup.exe from the Boot Camp drivers folder. I'd still like a better solution, though. All answers welcome!\n\nA: Probably your Boot Camp partition is hosed and couldn't be removed simply.\nSo i would try to reinstall Windows 7 with your pre-made (Microsoft's bootable USB creation tool!) thumb drive.\n\n*\n\n*Attach the Windows 7 installer thumb drive to your Windows server,  format it if necessary (FAT32) and create the bootable Win7 install thumb drive again with the Microsoft tool.\n\n\n*Download BootCamp5.1.5621 on your server\n\n\n*Extract BootCamp5.1.5621.zip\n\n\n*Copy the extracted files and folders ($WinPEDriver$, AutoUnattend.xml, BootCamp etc.) to the root of the thumb drive.\n\n\n*The file/folder structure in the root of your thumb drive should look like this:\n\n\n\n*Detach the thumb drive from your server\n\n\n*Attach the thumb drive to your Mac\n\n\n*Reboot your Mac and immediately hold the alt/option button until you see the boot menu\n\n\n*Choose your thumb drive as boot volume\n\n\n*Try to reinstall Windows 7.

In many decent text editors this works fine (for instance Sublime Text 2). They also keep the | position visible when text is selected btw.\nThe default behaviour of OSX apps, however, is that they ignore the fact that the cursor is currently at the start of the selection, and moving it to the right should remove the selection there. Instead,  ⌘ ⇧→ always extends the selection from its end until the end of the line, no matter where the cursor currently is:\nActual result:\n\nAAA {BBB CCC\nDDD EEE FFF}|\n\n\n\nIs there any way to make also native OSX apps behave the expected way?\nI'm on OSX Yosemite 10.10.2 but I think this issue has been there as long as I can remember.\n\nA: Mac doesn't use the cursor position if you have a multiple text selection, it considers the cursor is at 'all selected text'. \nYou can see this demonstrated if you use  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   ←  instead of  → \nAdding to the selection with  Shift ⇧  includes the previous selection.\nNot a fix, but a workaround might be  →  which would move the cursor to the end of your current selection, simultaneously deselecting it, then  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   ←   to select to the beginning of the line.\n\nA: So, the way I see it, text navigation on OS X works (and is expected to work) like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate per line (or document, i.e. huge chunks of data):\ncmd+arrow keys : moves by lines (left/right for lines, up/down for the whole document). Hold shift to select\n\n*Navigate per word (i.e. small chunks of data):\nalt+arrow keys : moves by word (left/right). Hold shift to select.\nSo to achieve your \"expected result\" you should press the right arrow first to get it to the end of your current selection and then cmd+shift+ ←  to select the line leading up to it.\nWhen you already have a selection: \n\n\n*\n\n*using the alt key combo's above will increase/decrease the selection based on direction (always modifying the end-point of your previous selection, presuming that you've missed the end point slightly). Same goes for adding single characters with shift+arrow keys only.\n\n*the cmd combo's increase in both directions, presuming you're after selecting big chunks of text anyway.\n\n\n\nUpdate\nLong story short: what you want isn't really possible.\nIf you look at the list of available system key bindings by running\nplutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict -o -|pl|grep -v noop:|ruby -pe '$_.gsub!(/[^ -~\\n]/)' | grep -i selection\n\nYou'll see that even though you can bind custom keys to all selection functions \n~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict \nthere is no such function that achieves your requested behaviour (since this behaviour is not built into the system).\n", "Q: Is there a way to group iCloud calendars so I can turn on/off several at once?

CoreStorage Volume (Group) non-destructively. The same is valid for non-CoreStorage partitions with on-board tools. AFAIK for the latter only iPartition and gparted work. Therefore you can't easily reclaim empty space with a lower start block and an arbitrary size and add it contiguously to existing CoreStorage or non-CoreStorage volumes.  \nOr with other words: You can expand volumes (CoreStorage or non-CoreStorage) from the ending block to higher block numbers but not from the starting block to lower ones.\nYou have 2 options though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recreating a larger second CoreStorage volume\n\n*Creating a new partition in the empty space and adding it as physical volume to your second Logical Volume Group. This will scatter your second Logical Volume Group over several Physical Volumes (PV2 & PV3 - the latter build in the empty space) on the same drive but might be unavoidable if another partition like your Recovery HD or a Data volume exists between LVG1 and immediately before PV2.\n\n\nBoth methods require you to backup/move the content of the second Logical Volume to another volume and its deletion afterwards.\nFor both methods force-backup all your data.  \nThen boot to an external thumb drive containing a bootable system or to Internet Recovery Mode (hit altcmdR immediately after the start-up chime)\n\n\n*\n\n*open Terminal.app in the menubar (Utilities/Terminal)\n\n*enter diskutil cs list and diskutil list\n\n*enter diskutil cs deleteVolume LV2UUID to delete the second Logical Volume\nin your case diskutil cs deleteVolume 976CA58C-E8FF-492A-9968-6FEF64C58A31\nNow the 2 different methods divert:\nRecreating a larger second CoreStorage volume (recommended): \n\n\n*\n\n*enter diskutil cs delete LVG2UUID to delete the second Logical Volume Group\nin your case diskutil cs delete 4793C4C8-0F56-4673-A2B6-98B15403CD33\nYour second Logical Volume Group will be converted to a classical volume with the name \"Untitled\".

It would be helpful to aid in demonstration in a class setting for me. Do you know if any such app exists that does not require an external pen i.e. using mouse or trackpad to draw.\n\nA: Check out Snappy App - it allows you to grab any part of your screen and float it above the screen - then you can draw on it, change its transparency, shrink it down, whatever. There's a free version which does more or less all you'd want and the in-app purchases are very cheap (you need an in-app to draw on things).\nI've also just recently been introduced to https://presentify.compzets.com/ which takes a different approach but might also meet the requirements.\n\nA: If you are looking for a screen annotation app that is unobtrusive and fast, check out DemoPro . DemoPro lets you configure hotkeys to draw on the screen, which is very convenient if you are doing live demonstrations. It also includes a countdown timer which can be useful for breakout sessions, exams, etc.\n\nA: This software does exactly that http://ink2go.org/ allows the user to draw on any application. It also allows for screen recording and other features. I suggest if you are looking for other alternatives to search for \"screen annotation software for mac\" that gave me more precise results.\n\nA: Screenink is also another app that will take a screenshot for the moment and allow you to draw on that, annotate and save.\n\nA: A friend uses Highlight. \nYou have to define your own hotkey to turn it on and off.\n\nA: I've been looking for a nice mouse highlight tool for 2 hours and find something different but really nice!\nhttp://screenbrush.imagestudiopro.com/\nWith the free version, you can easily draw on your screen and also highlight the screen with the shift key.\nIf you're still looking for a cursor highlighter I've found Mouse Locator App  (http://www.2point5fish.com/)\nBut it's not very polished and has few configuration options\nWhen I found Screenbrush it already made my day and stop searching, but I read on a forum post somewhere that if you change your search query to \"mac Screen annotation software\" you will have more results, maybe it helps in finding a better Cursor highlighter app.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Based on what you were looking for.

Genius - bought install DVD for 64-bit :-o  So I guess that's why it won't install.\nGoing to try suggested method of creating ISO from W7 store-bought DVD on Windows machine just for giggles and see what happens.  Then probably go buy the correct DVD for 32-bit  :-(  Thanks for the info :-)\n\nA: The problem you encountered occured before the Boot Camp drivers are installed. So, the drivers are not the problem. The correct drivers for Macs can be found at Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems. In your case, the drivers can be downloaded from Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. Also, the drivers can be downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant. By the way, I used the same drivers to do a clean install Windows 8 (64 bit) on my iMac7,1 (20-inch, Mid 2007).\nYour actual problem is with the DVD itself. As you might guess, it came with two ways to boot. You need to remove one of them. You are using a Windows 7 DVD. I was having the same problem with a Windows 8.1 (64 bit) DVD. The procedure to repair should be the same.\nI used a windows 8.1 machine and a copy of the program oscdimg.exe from Microsoft. The procedure should work just as well using a Windows 7 or 10 machine.\nTo begin, you will need to copy oscdimg.exe to your desktop. There are many web sites where a copy of this file can be found. I used oscdimg.exe Version 2.55 (x86). If you want to be sure you are using the same one I used, follow the steps below.\n\n*\n\n*Go to the web site The Windows® Automated Installation Kit (AIK)\nfor Windows® 7 and download the iso. This iso file is 1.7 GB in\nlength.\n\n\n*Open the file Neutral.cab. If you are using a Windows 7 machine, you\nwill need to burn the iso on to a DVD. The instructions can be found\nhere. Open the new DVD to find the Neutral.cab file. It is\nfaster to copy the Neutral.cab file to the desktop before opening\nit. If you are using a Windows 8.1 or 10 machine, right click on the iso\nicon and select Mount. Neutral.cab will be one of the files in the\nopened folder. (Note: Opening the file can take a while.)\nOne way to avoid burning a DVD would be to copy (or download) the iso file to a machine running OS X. The iso file can then be mounted by double clicking on its icon. Neutral.cab will be one of the files in the opened folder. You will need to copy Neutral.cab back to a Window machine. I tested this using OS X 10.6.8. I assume this procedure would work using any newer version of OS X.\nAnother way to avoid burning a DVD would be to copy (or download) the iso file to the ~/Downloads folder of a machine running Kubuntu (or perhaps some other Linux). The following commands can be used to extract the Neutral.cab to the ~/Downloads folder. You will need to copy Neutral.cab back to a Window machine. I tested this using Kubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.\ncd ~/Downloads\nmkdir windowsiso\nsudo mount -o loop,ro KB#AIK_EN.iso windowsiso\ncp windowsiso/Neutral.cab .\nsudo umount windowsiso\nrmdir windowsiso\n\n\n\n*Using a Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 machine, extract oscdimg.exe from the\nNeutral.cab cabinet file.

Rename the extracted file to\noscdimg.exe. (I did verify the correctness of this procedure by\ninstalling the entire package and binary file comparing the\ninstalled x86 and x64 oscdimg files with F1_oscdimg and F3_oscdimg,\nrespectively.)\nNext, make a new Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 installation DVD, follow these steps.

Me and my partner have a Mac Pro in our house, each with our own user account. We both use iTunes, have iPhones, our own Apple IDs, and each have a subscription to iTunes Match.\nHowever, for some unknown but frustrating reason, Apple only allows any one device to be connected to only one iTunes Match account, and in this case a device includes Macs. It simply won't let us enable iTunes Match on a second user account!\nWe both want to use iTunes Match, but I don't know how to make it work. Purchasing a second Mac for one of us to use isn't an option -- even ignoring the cost we only want one desktop computer. However, I do have a headless Mac Mini that I use as an always-on server, which might help.\nIs there anyway I can set things up so that we can both use iTunes Match?\nMy current thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use some kind of method or software to automatically keep two copies of my music library in sync: one on my Mac Pro, the other on the Mac Mini server. Have the Mac Mini's iTunes Library be tied to my iTunes Match account. My partner can keep using the Mac Pro. Note that for this to work the two synced iTunes libraries would need to share music, playlists, and (if possible) even statistics. Any change that happens on one would have to be transferred over to the other in manner that works with iTunes Match and allows it to upload the changes.\n\n*Figure out some way to combine our two libraries together (we have the same music collection anyway), use one iTunes Match account, but set it up so that we can access our music collection on both user accounts. Note that we'd still need to continue using our individual Apple IDs for most things on the phone, including for Contacts, Notes, Reminders, etc. Furthermore, we each have our own playlists and statistics so I'm not really leaning towards trying this.\n\n*Maybe there's a third option I haven't thought of...?\nI haven't undertaken any of these yet, because I honestly don't know if any of them are possible, which one is the path of least resistance and pain, or if there's a better option I don't know about.\nAny solutions or guidance anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: There's a kind of easy way to solve this as I found out recently. All it involves is using the same credit/debit card details on both iTunes accounts.\nYes, a little bit of a nuisance and there's no logic at all as why it would be this way but it solved it for me with my Macbook that I share with my daughter. 2 separate Apple ID's and 2 separate iTunes match accounts on the same Mac but she just pays me in cash if she buys something...\n\nA: If you're willing to go the two Macs route you might want to look into using\nRsync and either cron or the new lauchd.\nFirst I'd suggest doing a\n\nman rsync \n\nRsync will allow computers to mirror the iTunes libraries-- even deleting old files.\nCron is outdated, but, it allowed you to schedule a task at a time.\nLauchd is a .plist file -- which can run a script either periodically or in response to changes in a directory.\n", "Q: Not able to see the archive option Just got a new mac.

I then purchased 2 x 4 GB strips of RAM that were manufactured by PNY. Specifically, DDR3 RAM which is compatible with 1333 MHz and 1066 MHz.\nOnce I inserted the RAM into my system after removing the previous RAM, it failed after working for only 5 minutes. However, shortly after, the system rebooted and continued to do this until I shut down the computer on the 4th boot. I then reseated the RAM and ran the system again only to receive the same results. Now that I have replaced the old RAM, the system is working fine.\nDoes anyone know why this might be happening? Note: this RAM is brand new. \n\nA: Remove one of the 4 GB strips of RAM so that you are only using half of the total 8 GB that you say you purchased. Does the system run stable? If not, replace that strip of RAM with the one you removed. If the system is still not stable, remove that strip from the slot and insert it into the other slot. If this still does not solve the problem, you may want to try a different brand of RAM. \n", "Q: Can't burn newly created playlist to CD with iTunes 12.1 I just want to burn some music for my Mom to a CD-R.  I've done this multiple times. If I check MP3 CD box, I receive message stating all music is not MP3, and it won't allow. If I check other option, Data CD or DVD, it copies but if I insert into CD player, message is, \" No Audio.\" \nThis can't be this hard.\nAny help is appreciated.\nI have OS 10.7.5\nThanks\n\nA: If you go to View Options and selected Kind, you'll be able to see which of the tracks isn't an MP3. You can then convert it/them to MP3 and replace the originals in your playlist with the new ones. \n\nA: Does your Mom have an MP3 CD capable player? How many tracks are you trying to burn to the CD?  If you burn it as a standard audio CD, it will hold a little over an hour of music. If you burn it as an MP3 CD, it will burn as many MP3 files as can fit on a 650 MB CD-R. When you say you check other option to burn it as a Data CD, and you insert into a non-MP3 capable CD player, you would get a message that there is nothing to play. Otherwise, the way I would do it is this:  Insert a blank CD-R then drag the MP3 files directly onto the disc using Finder.

Tap on it and then tap Never to prevent them from being deleted automatically.\nNever or two minutes are your only options, though.\n\nA: If you want to have recording outside of iMessage (i.e. as an mp3 or whatever), then press and hold the recording in iMessage. A menu will appear with Copy, Save, More.... Select Save and your recording will now be in the Voice Memos app. From there you can tap the share button to send as email attachment, or you can get it from iTunes when you connect your phone to a computer. \nIn iOS 13 and above, you can select “copy” from the context menu. Then go to the Files app, tap and hold on some blank area inside one of your folders, then tap “paste”. An audio file of the message will appear.

If my negotiated link speed is 3 GB (instead of 6 GB), does this still mean I'm using SATA III on my early 2011 Macbook Pro 17-inch laptop?\n\nI ask because I'm currently upgrading my HDD with an SSD for this early 2011 Macbook Pro 17-inch model; does my negotiated link speed affect what kind of SSD's I should consider?  For example, are there any SSD's that I would need to steer clear of?\nAlso, can someone explain the difference between installing the SSD in the main drive vs. the optical drive?  What is the difference exactly and how can I take full advantage of it to maximize the performance of my early 2011 Macbook Pro?  For example, if I put a Crucial M500 into the main drive bay, would updating the optical drive bay as well make absolutely any difference in my performance?\nHere are a few links I considered (and a few others like it), but it did not help answer my specific questions: Is there a way to tell if I can use a SATA III SSD in my early 2011 MBP 15\"? and What is an SSD drive's negotiated link speed?\n\nA: Think of it as the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\nYes, there is. You need to look at the specs on the speed of each of your drives. Check in the About this Mac in your toolbar and go to more info, System report, the the sata section under Hardware. \nIn terms of the optical and main drive bay's, it doesn't matter which you use if both are capable of the same speeds. In most cases dealing with older models, the traditional hard drive bay provides the better speeds than the optical. I've read before that the optical bay will not always match the traditional bay.\nI'd put my SSD in the main bay and your secondary drive in the optical. You can configure which drive to boot from within System Preferences if you choose otherwise.\nI'd def put my OS and your applications on the fastest drive and use that to boot from. If you are using a regular hard drive to place in either of the bays then I'd also recommend you put all you media and other large less accessed files on that (especially if storage space is a concern or for some reason you are concerned about read/writes on your SSD). \n\nA: I have done a similar thing with a 13 inch macbook pro 2012. I put a  Samsung 840 EVO 120GB 2.5 inch Basic SATA Solid State Drive into the hdd bay and moved the hdd to the optical drive bay.  Works great and much faster booting etc.  From memory, I don't think it's an issue using a SATA III (6Gb/s) in a SATA II (3Gb/s) environment or vice versa, it's just that your speed will be limited by the lowest speed connection and that would basically mean that you are wasting money on a faster drive but getting a slower connection.\nHowever there may be an issue with your connection - see this link\n17 inch Mac Pro SATA issues\nI don't think putting 2 ssd drives would make much difference as long as you put your OS on your fastest (ssd) drive with your Application folder.  You can then put all your other files on you hd.  There are various ways to set this up one way is discussed here \nSSD and HDD setup in MBP\nalthough there are other ways (google will produce other results).\nI so seem to remember having trouble booting up from the optical drive bay though, so if memory serves correctly, I would suggest keeping the OS on the drive that you will be putting in the hdd bay (so presumably the ssd drive) \n", "Q: URL not opening on iPhone 5s via Wi-Fi We are accessing an URL (https://mobimytravel.wipro.com/APIMapper) but it is not opening in iPhone 5s & iPad using Wi-Fi but the same URL is opening in 3G. \nThis URL is opening in Android & other different iOS phones using Wi-Fi. \n\n\nA: You are trying to access the accountservices.wipro.com site.\nIt looks like they certificate has expired.\n\naccountservices.wipro.com uses an invalid security certificate.

I tried connecting also with my iPhone and before I entered the password I got a messag/e that \"MyWirelessNetwork\" is not connected to the internet. How can I solve this issue\n\nA: The first step is to run the Wireless Diagnostic from the Mac since it's easy. There are iOS diagnostics, but you'll have the best luck determining why OS X won't connect to the network. From there, the iPhone issue will likely be solved, but if not you'll have a smaller problem to solve.\nOption click your WiFi icon in the menu bar (place it there in network settings if it's absent) and then select Wireless Diagnostics.\n\nA: yeah sure you can,read the tutorial below, it exactly helps you out\nhttp://www.techtweetz.com/how-to-create-wifi-hotspot-on-windows-7-8-1-10/\n", "Q: Does FaceTime work if I purchase my iPhone in Saudi Arabia then move countries? I purchased an iPhone 6 with FaceTime from Saudi Arabia. Can I use FaceTime while I am India because someone told me that if you purchase an iPhone in Saudi Arabia the FaceTime does not work anywhere.\n\nA: This blog-post claims, selecting a different country in the settings while setting up your account already does the trick.

Does it mean that all data stored in (2) is also deleted? If not, how do I delete all my data from (2)?\n\nA: From my understanding, once you migrate to iCloud Drive, your old 'Documents & Data' storage is converted & no longer exists in its old location.\nMavericks/iOS 7 can't see iCloud Drive & Yosemite/iOS 8 can't see the old Documents & Data, migrated or not.\nRefs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/en-la/HT201104  \n\n*http://support.apple.com/en-la/HT201385  \n\n*http://www.cultofmac.com/296334/psa-shouldnt-upgrade-icloud-drive-ios-8-yet/  \n\n*http://www.howtogeek.com/203304/everything-you-need-to-know-about-using-icloud-drive-and-icloud-photo-library/\n\n\nA: I spoke to Apple support, and they confirmed what was said in the accepted answer -- when you upgrade from \"Documents & Data\" to \"iCloud Drive\", the data is moved, not copied. Hence, deleting your data from iCloud Drive means that it's gone from both locations on Apple servers.\n", "Q: Why is saying verification required on my iPhone 5c?

I have even tried putting in my card number and stuff and it just says that I have entered a wrong number but when I look at my bank account it shows that it took out $5.97. How do I make it stop so I can update my apps?\n\nA: Apple's servers are responsible for deciding if your device and account are in proper standing to make a purchase.\nOne of two things is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*your device is not working properly - most likely due to having two accounts and/or wrong date or other software corruption\n\n*your account on the server needs adjusting\n\n\nWith the little information you provided, more triage is needed to know which. You could get a second iOS device and wipe it clean / update it. If you can sign in and make one purchase there - try entering your card and verification details once there. Then making a second \"purchase\" which could even be a free app download, you will know if the problem is in Apple's side or on your device. \nAlternatively, you'll have to start changing one thing on your iOS device and re-testing. If you have a backup, you could erase all content and settings and then set up the device making sure the date/time are correct and then repeat the steps above.\nIf not, make a backup and then start here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/iphone/features/\nYou'll either use the Apple ID support link or perhaps try checking the status of the App Store or another link that grabs your eye - posting a new question here with update and details on your issue.\n", "Q: How do I really (dig) flush the DNS cache on OS X 10.9? I'm on OS X 10.9, according to support.apple.com I can flush the cache with\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nUnfortunately this does not really refresh my DNS cache at all, also not like this:\ndscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nE.g.\n$ dig www.example.com|grep CNAME\nwww.example.com.    83955   IN  CNAME   example.com.\n\nIf cache were cleared it would be showing a number close to 86400, 3600, 300 or 60 are the TTL values offered by my domain name provider).\nIf I add @dns-host to dig it works as expected:\n$ dig @ns0.transip.net www.example.com|grep CNAME\nwww.example.com.    60  IN  CNAME   GITHUBACCOUNT.github.io.\n\nI also tried the other commands on that page. In the meantime I work around this by ssh'ing onto one of my servers and check things there. But I'd like a proper way to really refresh all DNS cache on my Mac.  How can I do that?\n\nA: The effect you're seeing has absolutely nothing to do with the caches on your computer.\nInstead what you're seeing is that your recursive DNS server (i.e. typically your ISPs DNS server or Google DNS or similar) has taken the original TTL value and subtracted the amount of time passed since it retrieved these records from the authoritative DNS server.\nFor example let's say that you own example.com and have an authoritative DNS server set up that when queried gives you that CNAME with a TTL of 86400. Then at some random point in time, your ISPs recursive DNS server is asked by someone else for www.example.com and retrieves those records. It caches that information.\nNow you come along issuing the dig command without the @ parameter - this means that the request uses the server listed in /etc/resolv.conf, which is typically your ISPs recursive DNS server. Now you get the response back with TTL 83995, which means that 86400-83995=2405 seconds has passed since it originally retrieved those records.\nNowhere in this process is your standard, local macOS DNS cache involved, so mDNSResponder and dscacheutil is not going to change anything at all.\nThe reasoning behind this is that the authoritative DNS server has essentially stated that \"this information is valid for 86400 seconds\". The recursive DNS doesn't know if the authoritative DNS server has since been changed to give out new information, so it can only tell you that the information is now valid for a slightly smaller amount of time.\n", "Q: Emptying the trash failed with \"can't copy\" on Yosemite While using empty stack securely under Yosemite, it halted with the message:\n\nYou can't copy the item InfoPlist.strings because its name is too long or includes characters that are invalid on the destination volume.\n\nWhat's the matter and, more important, what can I do about it? \nPS. It might be that the InfoPlist.strings is located on an MS-DOS (FAT32) partition on an USB disk.

Currently I have an older style Timecapsule 2GB, the flat type, connect to my cable modem, and distributing network to my apartment both through cables (Xbox, PS4, Apple TV) and WIFI (everything else).\nI want to move this to a different room and in its place put a newer Airport Express thus having three base stations to provide wireless access to the network.\nReading the article leaves me with three concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the Timecapsule to a different room and ask it to join the WIFI network set up by the Airport Express\n\n*Hook up nearby equipment (a computer and a NAS) to the Timecapsule, and thus spread the network to those units as well?\n\n*Still continue backing up my iMac and MacBook Pro to it, without changes (provided I keep its name)\n\n\nI read this article: Wi-Fi base stations: Extending the range of your wireless network by adding additional Wi-Fi base stations and it has this section:\n\nWirelessly Extended Network (802.11n)\n\n\n\nI understand the part about being nearby, but the webpage mentions base stations as the unit you can use to extend and I'm not sure if a time capsule counts as a \"base station\" as it also mentions other types, so my question is, with the above setup, and the existing time capsule being the unit on the right, can I hook up a computer and a NAS to it using cables, and access them while connected to the left apple router over WIFI?\nThe setup would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftmost apple unit, connected to the cable modem with yellow cable, would server my Xbox, PS4, tables, MacBook Pro, iMac, using a combination of WIFI and cabled network\n\n*Rightmost apple unit, old time capsule\n\n*A server-like computer + a NAS connected to the time capsule using cables\n\n\nSo, in short - is the Time Capsule capable of working as a true Airport Base station?\n\nA: Yes - Time Capsule is a fully functioning Airport and you can bridge, extend or perform any other function of Airport networking as needed without regards to there being a hard drive inside the unit.\nYou needn't worry about changing the network topology and having Macs not find the backup. Even if you actually change the name of the Time Capsule or change the password needed to mount the drive - once you remove the old \"Time Capsule\" backup as a destination from each Mac, you can add it back with the new name and/or password and the system will know it's the same volume and continue backing up just as it left off - no duplication or other ill effects will ensue due to you changing the names / networking.\n\nI do exactly as you propose/describe with one change. I have a new AirPort Express that wirelessly extends (dotted lines) my network and I hard wire it (solid line) to the Time Capsule that used to provide wireless extension. I then turned off the wireless on the TC and run it in bridge mode (it's basically a gigabit ethernet switch now that provides three ethernet connections for two servers and a NAS) so that it's part of the network and still accessible as a backup volume.\n", "Q: How to create a private distribution list [group mailing list] in Mail.app? I know I can make a group in Contacts, and send a message to the group. Is there a way to hide the list of recipients?\nI have this setting in Mail prefs:\n\nI don't know any other setting to tweak. This setting does not stop addresses being shown.\n\nA: Send to yourself - some mailers won't send if there's no 'To' recipient\nMail.app actually will, so you could optionally leave the To field blank - though I'd test that your ISP allows it through as well, before relying on that.\nThen send to the group as BCC\nBCC stands for Blind Carbon Copy, as opposed to CC which is just Carbon Copy\ni.e. the recipients are hidden from each other.\nShow/hide the BCC field from the View menu, or  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   B  \n\nThen enter your Group name in the Bcc field; click the drop-menu or hit  Enter  once it's recognised.\nThe pref you mentioned - \"when sending to a group, show all member addresses\" - switches between showing the field as \"my Group\" or \"Fred, Barney, Wilma\" etc\n\n\nA: Another way to do this is to utilize the \"Contacts\" software to set up the Email, as is explained under \"Help\" for \"Contacts\", and then under \"Show Topics\" and then under “Composing” and then under \"Create Groups\" and then under \"Email a Group\"...\nFor me, the first option worked, but the second one did not work (names of all the Members of the group were displayed in the \"To\" field of the Email addressed to the group). I haven't yet tried the third option...\nAbsent that approach, in “Mail” software (version 9.2) under “Addressing”, in which, if the first box is not checked, the Email addresses are supposedly not displayed; however, that approach did not work, for me, and this additional step was successful in avoiding the display of all the addresses...\n", "Q: Can a wired (ethernet) Mac act as a WiFi access point? A MacPro '10 running 10.6.8, connected to the network via Ethernet. \nIf I'd like to add a webcam is a router required or can I set up direct access? i.e. can AirPort act as an access point?  \n\nA: Yes, you can do that.

In the image of an OSX Yosemite 10.10.2 Finder window below, you can see that the content of the 'blog' folder has been most recently modified. However, the 'Date modified' sort of the parent folder 'D' is not showing the 'blog' folder at the top of the list.\nWhy is this, and is there a way to sort the list as I intend? I seem to remember it was fine in previous versions of OSX.\n\n\nA: Modification dates for folders are only updated when the folder's contents are edited, not the folder's contents' contents. In other words, you probably edited something in the DES folder, which changed the modification date for the DES folder, but you didn't create, remove, or edit anything directly inside the blog folder since 2015-01-06.\n\nA: Any chance you've mucked around with the custom date/time formatting in System Prefs, as described here?\n", "Q: Mac NetInstall does not send booter on specific devices Using Mac Server on 10.9, with only NetInstall working (we use InfoBlox for DHCP) I can successfully NetBoot to our only image from a iMac Pro (Core2Duo), but not from a MacBook Pro (Intel i7, ~2012).\n\n\n*\n\n*I captured the NBI on the newer MacBook Pro (Deploystudio Netboot Set)\n\n*Both devices list the boot image in the boot options menu at startup.\n\n*Both devices allow me to SELECT the image.\n\n*Both devices send a BSDP ACK[SELECT] to the server.\n\n*Server sends both devices at least an ACK pktsize 300 to the correct IP.\n\n\nThe MacBook Pro decides, after all this, that it will just boot to the regular local disk, which is not what should happen. Whereas the main iMac boots to the network disk (Apple Logo with mini spinning globe).\nDoes anyone have any ideas why the MacBook Pro does not boot, considering it is communicating with the server?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Although using only NetInstall. My problem was cause by the fact that the Netboot image (folder)and files inside of it had incorrect permissions (for instace the booter files had no access to the everyone group.\nAfter I fixed the entire folder permission manually Netboot worked.\nI hope this helps you.\n", "Q: Mac Encrypted HDD Please help! Hi everyone I have encrypted a partition of an external hard drive from the mac desktop.\nI pressed that key button then pressed memorable and it changed my entire password unknowingly.\nI need help.  All I know now is that its 12 characters long.\n\nI have loads of pictures and videos on there from when my kids were born. Please someone help me I beg you.\nAlso please don't tell me its impossible because nothing is impossible.\n\nA: You could see about getting a quote from a data recovery team to attempt to reverse engineer your situation. Since you are fairly certain that the key is 12 characters long, that significantly reduces the number of passphrase that must be attempted to unlock the volume.\nAlso, paying a professional to do this means you are only renting the equipment and/or software to try each combination rather than needing to fund that yourself.\nSince the encryption takes time and is reversible, it clearly is possible to brute force this, but I would get a quick feeling for how much of the drive is encrypted by saving the output of diskutil list and diskutil cs list and then ejecting the drive and powering it off until you can get it in the hands of a pro.\nAlso, you do have to re-type the entire password manually and then confirm the operation, so perhaps you just had a normal software error and didn't establish the encryption. Best of luck with the recovery. Losing data is no fun and having  baby pictures only on one drive is not something I ever like to confront - yet it does happen and the pain is awful in most cases to lose those artifacts of the time and memory.\n", "Q: Application folder is empty I am using OSX - Snow Leopard on my Mac.\nI could find the Application folder is empty, please help.\nThank you!\nRegards,\nKrishna\n\nA: As stated by Tom. you may be looking in the wrong Applications folder.  There are 2 - the main one is in the root directory so all users can access them: There are various ways to see root - I use shift-command-c  from a finder window - you should see all your drives/network/servers etc.  Click on main OS drive, probably called Macintosh HD and the main App folder will be there. You will also see the Users folder.  If you delve into there, you may well see another, possibly empty Application folder.

BT mail worked fine on my iPhone and PC but NOT on the iPad.   Solved the issue by simply deleting the 'Mail' app and reinstating from the app store .. re-entered email and password and away it went fine.

I finally tried Command+R to attempt Time Machine(none were available), Disk Utility but \"Repair Disk\" was greyed out, and finally tried to reinstall Mac OS X but when it was close to completion, again, it showed Macintosh HD is damaged. \nI bought an external hard drive hoping to save my school work from Macintosh HD. \n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility>External Hard Drive>Partition>GUID Partition>Mac OS\nExtended \n\n*Ran OS X Installer and selected my External Hard Drive as the target. Near completion, it gave me the option of transferring my\ninformation from another drive. I selected the first option (Mac\netc), but when it came to loading my internal drive, it didn't load.\nI let it run for several hours but still to no avail so I skipped the\nprocess and finished registering. \n\n*When my Mac loaded, it showed the message that Macintosh HD is damaged. Please back up your files immediately. \n\n*I loaded Finder, but Macintosh HD is not listed under devices. \n\n*I loaded Disk Utility and at first it showed my Macintosh HD with my 69GB/500GB...but then it disappeared after I clicked on Verify\nDisk. \n\n*If I unplug my External Hard Drive, Mac shows a grey screen with a folder and question mark.\n\n\nIs there anyway of recovering the data on my Macintosh HD now? \nIf I don't replace the hard drive and just continue to operate using my external hard drive will that work? I am not sure whether it's better to just get a Thinkpad or repair/replace the internal hard drive. \nI appreciate all help and advice you can offer! Thank you \n\nA: I wouldn't suggest continuing to use an external drive for your MBP, apart from anything else it's just not practical.  \nIt seems like your internal drive has or is just about to fail.  Have you/can you check it's SMART status from disk utility?  Either way, I would suggest not worrying about trying to verify or repair it - just try and get your important files copied over to your external HD/other back up disk whilst you can still get some access to it.\nReplacing a HD in a MBP is actually quite easy, ifixit: https://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_13%22_Unibody_Early_2011 has good instructions.  \nI have replaced a HDD in a MBP 2012 and would rate it as moderately easy.  Hdd are fairly inexpensive these days and tools to do the job properly are available readily from Amazon for only a few quid.\n", "Q: Screen sharing without allowing others to access my account? I sometimes work from home (MacbookPro-10.6.8) and would like to screen share with my iMac(10.9) at work. The screen-sharing is easy enough, but I share an office with several other people. To put it nicely, my coworkers haven't grown up yet... When I work remotely they are able to see what I am doing, then go to my desk, take control of my mouse/keyboard, make changes to my code \"as a prank\", etc. It's quite frustrating to say the least. Is there anyway to screen share without allowing someone else to have direct access to my work?\n(Someone mentioned to me that there's a way of having a dummy user's account show up on the iMac while I'm working on my own account, but they weren't sure how to do this-and I can't seem to find anything about it. Any ideas?) Thanks!\n\nA: Yes - the Apple Remote Desktop app allows you to curtain the controlled computer to lock out anyone that's physically at the computer while you work remotely.\nYou could also set your work Mac to boot to a harmless account that auto logs in and is not an administrator. When you use OS X screen sharing (as opposed to Remote Desktop) it will ask you if you want to share screen with the \"dummy\" user and you can decline and start your own session that isn't visible locally.\nTry the second unless you want to invest in the Remote Desktop tool or can't add a second user due to work constraints.\n\nA: You can try to disable the Monitor\nhttps://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor\nI don't know if it really works remotely and it disables only the Monitor and does not lock the Screen. \nAnother option is TeamViewer, with TeamViewer you can switch the monitor of the remote computer to a black screen. The Action is called \"Show black screen\", together with \"Disable remote input\" the remote computer is completely locked, check the TeamViewer documentation for more information.  \n", "Q: Admin vs firstname and lastname I've been using OS X since Lion. I'm a sole user of my Mac.\nWhen I log into the Mac, I log in as Admin. Also, in System Preferences, under Users & Groups, the Current User is listed as Admin. However, in Finder, under /Users, there's a folder with a cottage icon on it, named my firstname and lastname\nAlso, when I run get_current_user() in PHP (inside a XAMPP installation), I get my firstname and lastname\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the relationship between Admin and firstname and lastname ? Are they the same? \n\n*Why is it that Mac thinks the current user is Admin , but PHP thinks that the current user is my firstname and lastname?\n\n*Under System Preferences, why isn't my firstname and lastname listed anywhere?\n\n*What's the significance of Users listed in the Users folder? Are they different than users listed in System Preferences under Users & Groups?\n\n*Does the concept of a unix-like root account factor in anywhere here?\n\n\nA: OS X uses a short user name and a long user name.\nThe short name is the home folder shown in /Users/xxxxx and the long name is only shown for programs and settings that know to request the long name to display. Any where you get to enter a user name, you can choose to use either the short or long name.\nTo see this in practice, you can either use terminal:\nwhoami\nwhoami | id\n\nThe first will print your short name and the second shows your ID and your user numbers and internal accounting.\nThis is covered in several Apple support articles - best being: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548\nI would recommend you make a back up and have someone to check your work if you try changing the short name. It can cause old backups to get erased (since the new folder gets backed up and doesn't \"save space\" like other Time Machine backups do) and can cause your account to not work where you'd need to reset the setup manually and create a third admin account to patch things up.\n", "Q: Photos on my iPhone 5 (101) but only the latest (23) show up in iCloud My iPhone 5 has 101 photos (& 7 videos) but on my PC > iCloud Photos > My Photo Stream only shows the last 23 of those photos.  \n\nA: Photos in My Photo Stream are saved on the iCloud server for 30 days only.

I run geekbench on some computer on 10.10.2 get 7500,and on windows on same computer get 7200,does this mean OS X 10.10.2 faster than Windows 8.1 on same hardware?\n\nA: I personally feel that speed tests such as these are of theoretical interest but not of any value in the real world.  After years of faffing around with windows and comparing to Mac after I saw the light, speed issues become a moot point:\nWork flow windows: switch on-> wait 20 minutes for latest update to install->spend a further 20 minutes repairing the issues the update created->have a cup of tea to unwind->back to windows and with any luck the thing would work (about an hour total + time to complete initial intended task)\n:Mac OSX workflow: click mouse to fire up (1 second)->open app ->  good to go (about 4 seconds+time to complete intended task)\nIn light of this, who cares if 1 machine takes 1 or 2 more miiliseconds to \"theoretically\" complete a given set of CPU calculations?\n", "Q: Does anyone know of a todo-list app that can sync via USB between iOS and Mac?

Thanks! \n\nA: I've been looking for something similar, and it has proven quite difficult to find options. Everything's moving to the cloud.\nAppigo's Todo app seems to allow local sync, but that may be limited to Wifi sync (with both devices on the same network). Still, even something like that (which at least does not involve a 3rd party server) is hard to find.\nOmnifocus has a similar option that allows sync without a 3rd party server, but it requires you to run a webdav server on your mac (e.g. via server.app).\nI'd love to hear of other options!\n\nA: Look for \"Todoist\" on App store.  Not entirely sure about the USB connection though.  \nAlso not sure why you would want that?

For various reasons, I believe that someone has blocked me in iMessage, but I am not 100% sure.\nRight now, it shows the message is delivered.\nIs there a way to see if they blocked me, or if they have just not read it yet?\n\nA: There currently is no definite way to tell.\nHowever, if a person does not respond after a long period of time, they most likely have blocked you.\n", "Q: How to manage multiple Bluetooth mics on an iPhone? My car has Bluetooth integration, yet even when parked with the radio turned off, so long as the engine is running, the car's mic takes precedence over the very nice Bluetooth dictation mic I'd prefer to use. How can I force my iPhone to choose the dictation mic when parked without unpairing from the car?\n\nA: There is an order of precedence for Bluetooth devices connected to iPhone. See iPhone Bluetooth Pairing on StackOverflow:\n\n\nWhat determines precedence is the order they are connected for that session. The last connected device has the highest precedence and is the one used.\n\n\nTherefore, to ensure the dictation mic is used, connect it after your car connects. If it's already connected when the car connects, you would need to disconnect the dictation mic and reconnect it. (Turning it off and then on again should accomplish this, but without knowing what device it is, it is impossible for me to state this with any certainty.)\n", "Q: Cloudd wants to use the \"Local items\" keychain I opened my MBP and certainly the system gives the following warning \"Cloudd wants to use the \"Local items\" keychain\" and asks me for my keychain-password.

I'm trying to diagnose an intermittently slow command. When I run the command and see it hanging, I press control + t to get the PID, then in another tab, run diagnose [PID] - eg, diagnose 123. I've defined diagnose as a function in my zsh configuration:\n# See system calls of the process with a given PID\nfunction diagnose() { sudo dtruss -cade -p \"$1\" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dtruss_output }\n\nObviously, since I'm reacting when I notice a hang, I run diagnose several seconds after the process started. The output lists many system calls, but I wonder whether I'm missing anything important.\nDoes dtruss list commands retroactively? In other words, does the output of dtruss -p [PID] include system calls made by that process before dtruss was run?\n\nA: No\nI've just run an experiment to test this. I wrote and ran this Ruby script:\nputs \"going to read foo\"\nputs File.read('/tmp/foo.txt')\n\nsleep 5\nputs \"going to read bar\"\nputs File.read('/tmp/bar.txt')\n\nsleep 5\nputs \"going to read baz\"\nputs File.read('/tmp/baz.txt')\n\nAfter it started, I ran diagnose on its PID, as described above.

This is such a strange issue; I can't imagine a single advantage to intentionally disabling this functionality.\n\nA: Calling emergency numbers is prohibited in Siri to prevent accidental calls being made. You need to use the Phone app manually or the Emergency dialer on the lock screen to make calls to emergency numbers.\nHowever, in some locations, you can say something similar to 'call the police' and this will succeed as I believe Siri is more accurately able to understand what you are saying.\n", "Q: How do I turn on calculator in spotlight without enabling conversions?

I've disabled all of these options, leaving \"Calculator, System Preferences and Applications\" out of principle.

In the latter case, pressing TAB again either beeps again (because there are no such names at all), or displays a list of the choices. \nIt seems as though this behaviour introduces ambiguity whereas it seems like the entire point is to prevent ambiguity. I would like to remove the beep that happens when many files with the same prefix exist. It just seems like extra effort and it makes me feel like I did something wrong until I realize that I haven't.\nHow do I change the behaviour of terminal's TAB completion, specifically to only beep if no such file exist and show possibilities otherwise?\n\nA: You need to put this line inside ~/.inputrc file: \nset show-all-if-ambiguous on\n\nAfter this You'll get all posssibilities after first ⇥ TAB.\n", "Q: How to disable line break conversion in Parallels Desktop?

I'm trying to set up my Mac so that it will exclude files in a folder called 'XYZ' from the search results in spotlight only. The reason is because these files are mostly private, and I don't want them to pop up in a spotlight search. \nHowever, I still want to be able to search them in a finder window, where I have a little more control than in spotlight. (To be clear, search normally with alt+command+space, exclude folder from command+space). Any idea how something like this could be done?\n\nA: From my experience excluding a folder from Spotlight indexing will exclude the files/folders from showing up when you do a search in Spotlight (command+space) but will still allow you to open that folder in finder and use the search bar in the top right of finder to search within that folder only. I imagine that the search of an un-indexed folder means the OSX will search in real time, or temporarily index the folder to allow you to do a folder search that has been excluded from the main Spotlight index and then erase it when you close the Finder window.\nJust make sure once you've typed in your search word(s) in the search bar that you click the name of your folder/drive in the \"Search\" criteria in the grey bar that appears (as shown below).\n\nTo exclude a folder from appearing in the Spotlight search, and therefore from being indexed go to: System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy tab, then click the + and select the folder you want to exclude:\n\n\nA: OS X uses the Spotlight index for both the \"Spotlight\" search and \"Finder\" search.  I don't believe it is possible to exclude something from one, and not the other, as they are both technically \"Spotlight\" searches, just with different graphical representations.  \n", "Q: Dock Icon that activates PageDown Is it possible to create a mac OSX dock icon that activates the page down key? \n\nA: Here is a simple example:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontmostProcess to first process where it is frontmost\n    delay 0.01\n    key code 121\nend tell\n\n116 is key code for page up.

A simple fix is to open ~/.ssh/known_hosts in any text editor, remove the entirety of line 1 (as indicated by \"known_hosts:1\" in the error), save the file and try to connect again. This time, you will be prompted to add the key and it will be added automatically.\nThe known_hosts file stores keys for hosts to confirm that the host that you are connecting to is the host that is expected.

I forgot my iPhone 5 passcode when I was changing the code. A window appeared on the device screen saying that iPhone is disabled.\nI have Apple ID and password for it. After signing in to iCloud I have erased the device in order to remove the passcode from my iPhone but it still says that device will be erased when device will connect to internet. What would i have to do?\n\nA: Connect the device to a Mac over USB and restore it using Finder. Since you have control of the AppleID that locks that device, you only need to get it connected to a network again. You can also see the last backup date online and know how much data might be lost in a restore.\nOnce the restore process is complete, you can restore the backup or just set up the phone as new. The apps, data, passcode will all be erased.\n\nA: If the iPhone has ever been connected to internet on WiFi, go to the same place.  It will connect again and erase.\nIf it has a SIM card and a valid cell contract with data, and you had not turned off cell data, it will connect and erase as soon as it gets a reasonable cell signal.\nIf none of those, connecting to a MacOS device and setting it up as new will erase non-default  apps and data.  You can then login with your Apple ID and download any apps you’ve added from the App Store and any data that had been in iCloud.  Data that was only local will be gone.\n", "Q: How to simulate multiple mouse clicks while holding the mouse button? I want my mouse to rapidly auto-click when I hold the left mouse button and to stop as soon as I release the left button. How can I do this?\nI have searched for hours, I didn't find anything! Is there possibly a way to do it with AppleScript? Or if there's a free application that can do this, it's perfectly fine too.\n\nA: I made a solution for you.  Its got a few pieces, it might have taken me forever to come up with, and could probably use some polishing but its pretty darn close to what you wanted.  The only thing I cannot see us being able to accomplish is holding the mouse down to do it.  I couldn't find anything that would allow us to use the mouseup to turn off our clicking loop, so I used a toggle: Click once to start our crazy clicks , and click again to stop it (I used the middle click button as my start and stop)\nWe are using applescript, a command line tool for OSX called MouseTools, and an application called MagicPref to assign the script to one of our mouse buttons.\nonce you download and extract MouseTools, it is just a batch script.  I put it and my applescripts inside the same folder (I named the folder superclicks).  Now we just need to create a loop that clicks at the current location of the mouse, and a way to break out of that loop. \nHere are the two applescript apps we make:\nlaunch.app\nglobal thisFile\nset thisFile to (path to me)\n\nglobal thisFolder\ntell application \"Finder\" to set thisFolder to container of thisFile as text\n\n\n# Function to check current state / should we should stop clicking\non checkstate()\nlocal clickState\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists file (thisFolder & \"STOP_CLICKING.txt\") then\n        set clickState to false\n    else if exists file (thisFolder & \"CLICKING.txt\") then\n        set clickState to true\n    else\n        set clickState to null\n    end if\nend tell\nreturn clickState\nend checkstate\n\n#function to update state of clicking via text files\n#im sure there is a better way, but this certainly works\non togglestate()\nif checkstate() is null then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to make new file at thisFolder with properties     {name:\"CLICKING.txt\"}\nelse if checkstate() is true then\n    tell application \"Finder\" to make new file at thisFolder with properties {name:\"STOP_CLICKING.txt\"}\nelse if checkstate() is false then\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        delete file (thisFolder & \"CLICKING.txt\")\n        delete file (thisFolder & \"STOP_CLICKING.txt\")\n    end tell\nend if\nend togglestate\n\n\ntogglestate()\n#we dont really want 3 states so we'll toggle again after a reset\nif checkstate() is null then togglestate()\n\nif checkstate() is true then\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    open (thisFolder & \"clicking_script\")\nend tell\nend if\n\nclicking_script.app\nglobal thisFile\nset thisFile to (path to me)\n\nglobal thisFolder\ntell application \"Finder\" to set thisFolder to container of thisFile as text\n\n\n## Function to check current state / should we should stop clicking\non checkstate()\nlocal clickState\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists file (thisFolder & \"STOP_CLICKING.txt\") then\n        set clickState to false\n    else if exists file (thisFolder & \"CLICKING.txt\") then\n        set clickState to true\n    else\n        set clickState to null\n    end if\nend tell\nreturn clickState\nend checkstate\n\n\n# let the clicking begin\non crazyClick()\nset x to 0\nrepeat until checkstate() = false or x = 1000\n    do shell script ((POSIX path of thisFolder as text) & \"mousetools -leftClick\")\n    do shell script ((POSIX path of thisFolder as text) & \"mousetools -releaseMouse\")\n    set x to (x + 1)\n    delay 0\nend repeat\nend crazyClick\n\ncrazyClick()\n\nThese two scripts need to be saved as applications. Once you have those three items in your folder all you have to do is assign launch.app as a custom application to be launched for a particular click using MagicPrefs.\nWhen you activate the script it clicks like crazy until you activate it again, which breaks the loop by adding some empty text files to the folder. We used the text files as a simple way to have external variables.\nI have zipped all the files for easy downloading.\nIt might not be perfect but its definitely a good start to seeing what creativeness can be accomplished with automation.\n", "Q: How can I continue a partial, interrupted download of Yosemite? I was trying to download OS X Yosemite. It is very big - more than 5GB.\nThe download did not succeed due to some problem in internet connection.

I have downloaded an iPad app called LaunchPad in which you put sounds into buttons aligned in squares so they can be easily played. The problem is that this LaunchPad app only accepts .wav audio files and all my audio effects are in the .caf format and they are like a hundred sounds. Is there a program to convert multiple files (a whole folder of files) into another format?\n\nA: You can use ffmpeg (binary or install with Homebrew):\nffmpeg -i sound.caf sound.wav\n\nThis can be run on an entire folder using find:\nfind /path/to/folder/ -name \"*.caf\" -exec ffmpeg -i {} {}.wav \\;\n\n\nA: You can use afconvert:\nafconvert sound.caf sound.wav\n\nThis can be run on an entire folder using find:\nfind /path/to/folder/ -name \"*.caf\" -exec afconvert {} {}.wav \\;\n\n", "Q: What does an \"All\" nested group do in a \"Match All\" Smart Playlist? When creating a Smart Playlist, what does placing a \"All of the following are true\" nested group when the playlist is set to \"Match all of the following rules\"?\n\nI've tried reading through it logically a few times, and I always end up with it not actually contributing to the flow of the smart playlist. If all the items in the nested group have to be true, and all the items directly under parent must be true, it seems that this configuration would only serve as a way to group similar items to a user's preference.\nIs there a logical precedence that I am missing where having a \"match all\" nested group on the first level of a \"match all\" smart playlist makes sense?\n\nA: It appears to simply use Logical AND if you stack like that\neg\n\nvs\n\nUsing Any switches it to using Logical OR, so you could, with a bit of juggling get a combination of the two, AND & OR\nEdit - I found an example\n\n", "Q: Mail.app thinks I'm a new user My laptop locked up (black screen, spinning beachball), and after leaving it to see if it would handle whatever it was doing on its own overnight, I went and held the power button down to force it to shut down.\nWhen I brought it back up, everything seemed okay until I went into Mail.app ... which is asking me about my account information, as if I had never used it.\nI unfortunately don't have a recent backup.  I see that I still have a ~/Mail directory, which looks to have lots of my local folders defined.\nShould I go through with the 'new user' setup, to see if it finds my existing local mailboxes, or is there some other recommended procedure for this process?\nI'm running OS 10.6.8, and Mail.app 4.6.  (And before I get lots of comments, yes, I know they are old, and yes, I know that the newer OSes are free upgrades)\n\nA: I don't think Mail has changed too much from 10.6.8 to now, but you should take my advice with caution, since I don't have the old system at hand.\nBefore starting this process, quit Mail. Any time you want to do a new test or reset to the existing state, quit Mail -- don't go copying or restoring things while Mail is running.\nNow, copy your ~/Library/Mail and ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/Mail directory to a safe backup location. Also copy ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist. That should enable you to revert to the current status if something you try goes south.\nI'm not sure what the ~/Mail directory is (I'm pretty sure I never had that in 10.6.8), but make a backup copy of it too.  It might be worth comparing that to ~/Library/Mail, especially the timestamps; if you're like me, it's likely an old copy.\nKent observed many corruption issues can usually be traced to a single file (~/Library/Mail/Envelope Index in 10.6). After you have the backup safely tucked away, you could try removing that file from the actual directory before starting mail for what follows. I think it will be regenerated, though that could take a while for big mailboxes.\nI would then try setting up the user account. Either it will find the existing mailboxes, or destroy them. If it destroys them, you copy them back in from your backup, possibly delete the user, and try something else; or you can import the contents of those mailboxes. \nI don't have time to check it now, but this advice could probably be compared to advice for 10.6 by searching on mail issues for that OS. You could find out exactly where the various information is stored, I'm pretty sure.\n", "Q: May I remove Python.framework in $PATH enviroment variable? I recently upgraded Python (via downloaded .dmg files). Before, my $PATH looked like this:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nNow when I run the command: \n$ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\\n'\n\nthe following two lines are added:\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin\n\nI've noticed that my ~/.bash_profile has only the following content:\n# Setting PATH for Python 3.4\n# The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\n# Setting PATH for Python 2.7\n# The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\nSo, if the original versions are saved in their respective, python-specific .bash profiles, can I delete this content from my ~/.bash_profile?\nWhy would these duplicates be added to ~/.bash_profile in the first place?\n\nA: Unless the new items are causing trouble, I suggest leaving them as-is. Most apps will probably have their desired version of Python bundled with them, but some may not, and some may want the 2.7 framework rather than the 3.4 version. The only issue I can think of is if Python 3.4 is running and accidentally stumbles over the 2.7 files first because they are first in the PATH.\nAs for where they're coming from, they're coming from your .bash_profile. The lines you pasted from there show the two directories being prepended to the PATH environment variable. Since they don't get added twice, the Python installation edited your .bash_profile directly. Removing them will, no doubt, remove them from PATH, with questionable benefit.\nFinally, I would not recommend uninstalling both versions of Python. Keep at least the one that came with your OS. You might have some better control using MacPorts to install updated versions of Python, if you really need them. Again, you don't say if there's any real problem other than things looking funny, so it's hard to make recommendations.\n", "Q: iTunes NOT Using Gift Cards on File I have as my iTunes balance around $52. When my son, using the Family Share program, requests to purchase a song and I approve, it is bypassing the Gift Card balance and charging my credit card.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: From Apple's \"How iTunes Store purchases are billed\":\n\nHow are Family Sharing purchases billed? When you initiate a new purchase, it will be billed directly to the family organizer's\n  account, unless you have gift or store credit. First, your store\n  credit will be used to pay the partial or total bill. The remainder\n  will bill to the family organizer. iTunes Store credit on your account\n  isn't shared with other family members. So if the family organizer has\n  a $50 credit on their account and another family member initiates a\n  purchase, it won't deduct from the organizer's iTunes Store credit,\n  but will bill the organizer's credit or debit card. The family\n  organizer will get the receipts for any of their family member's\n  purchases.\n\nMore important legal verbiage about the iTunes Store at this link.\n\nA: I have the same problem.  It seems you need to redeem iTunes gift cards on the child's device NOT your computer or device. In other words whichever Apple ID you use to redeem the gift card is who can use it.   You have to go into iTunes Store on the device you want to use the gift card and use the redeem function. \n", "Q: How to import .eml files into Mail? I'm using readpst to extract emails from a bunch of old outlook .PST files.\nIt does a great job of pulling out all the emails .EML files, with attachments included.\nBut how do I bring these into Apple Mail?\nAny of the \"Import...\" options create a separate mailbox for each message.\nI want to be able to import groups of messages into a particular mailbox.\n(I know that readpst can also generate mbox files, which Apple Mail handles OK, but slowly; but this is not what I want to do.)\n\nA: If you put the exported e-mails (*.eml files) into a folder structure, then just select the outer folder as the import folder.\nThe test import I just did is like below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Apple Mail\" as the \"Import data from\":\n\n\n \n\n\n*Select the outer (root) folder of the e-mails to import:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Confirm the selection: \n\n\n\n\n\n*The imported .eml e-mails is now in an 'import' mailbox (only one mailbox) with the same folder structure as the folder the import came from:\n\n\n\nNow you can move all or selected e-mails from the import folder to the mailbox of choice. When all e-mails has been moved, just delete the 'import' mailbox.\n", "Q: \"Identical\" DMGs: one installs, one does not We've got a DMG from a vendor that we put on our web server for download. After download, the file on my Mac (OSX 10.10.1) is identical to the original file (did a hex compare), and the DMG mounts fine... but the installer inside the DMG will not work after download.\nTo put it a different way, I have two seemingly identical DMG's, both of which mount, but only one of which will actually run the installer in the image, once mounted.\nThe permissions were slightly different between the two DMG's after download. Changed them so they are now identical.\nWe've tried this on three Macs with at least two versions of OSX, and the results are the same.\nWhat else could be wrong?

Thanks.\n", "Q: Is there a security tools package for Mac OS X? I mean a package of tools like those in the Kali Linux distribution. \n\nA: The closest thing I know of is HackPorts.\n\nHackPorts was developed as a penetration testing framework with\n  accompanying tools and exploits that run natively on Mac platforms.\n  HackPorts is a ‘super-project’ that leverages existing code porting\n  efforts, security professionals can now use hundreds of penetration\n  tools on Mac systems without the need for Virtual Machines.\n\n\nA: While I am generally less-than satisfied with security testing on OS X, many Kali-inherited utilities run fine under OS X via HomeBrew, e.g., afl-fuzz, aircrack-ng, amap, argus, arp-scan, arping, binutils, binwalk, bro, capstone, cowpatty, crunch, ettercap, hachoir, hping, ideviceinstaller, ike-scan, ipv6toolkit, john, lft, libdnet, libimobiledevice, libnet, masscan, net-snmp, netcat, nikto, nmap, openssl, ophcrack, p0f, postgresql, pwnat, pwntools, radare2, reaver, ruby, sipsak, skipfish, sleuthkit, snort, socat, sqlmap, ssdeep, ssldump, stunnel, theharvester, usbmuxd, volatility, wireshark, zmap -- and many others.\nPrimary reason I mentioned postgresql and ruby above is because these can be time savers when installing metasploit-framework.\nThere are many missing utilities when compared to huge Debian repos such as Kali Linux or even larger community-driven repos like ArchAssault. However, some pen testers (and pen-test tool developers!) are using OS X as their primary platform, as seen in GitHub and other project repos such as Arachni, blacksheepwall, cookiescan, et al. Other key tools such as dirb, sslyze, and similar can be easily compiled under OS X. Ones that rely on interpreters such as Go, Lua, Python, and Ruby are often much easier than metasploit-framework to get working under OS X. Install Python modules through brew-pip for added benefits and tie-ins to HomeBrew and install Ruby modules via gem after installing it via HomeBrew and making /usr/local/bin a preferred path over /usr/bin.\nIn addition to what has been said so far, VMWare ESXi in VMWare Fusion Pro on OS X using a high-end, maxed-out-DRAM MacBook Pro makes a good virtualized environment for security testing and learning -- http://www.slideshare.net/c0ncealed/step-on-in-the-waters-fine-an-introduction-to-security-testing-within-a-virtualized-environment-39596149\nIn this way, I believe that OS X makes a good virtualization host for security testing, but one may want to rethink using it as a platform to target production-level attacks from. There are many reasons for this, but the primary being that critical security patches for client-aware tools are not quite as up-to date when compared to Arch Linux, Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, or even Debian. A secondary factor is that it has been historically easy to escalate privileges to root, with no way to add SELinux, GRSecurity, or DISA STIG hardening practices to OS X in the way one can with standardized Linux operating systems, such as RHEL or Debian. Some people do consider running OpenBSD or Ubuntu on Apple bare metal for these reasons and others. It is possible to run OS X under VMWare Workstation for Linux, but this is likely not an Apple-approved scenario.\nThere is also the Docker way, seen here -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC_vm1wc-AY -- which I am definitely going to test out\n\nA: Run Kali in a VM and get a supported USB 802.11 dongle and a USB ethernet adapter and forward both to the Kali VM. \nWhile stuff like aircrack-ng and Kismet might work on OS X, having a proper full Linux system makes pentesting a lot easier.\nTry it with stuff like VirtualBox!\n\nA: Open http://sectools.org/ and find the tools you want. Some of the tools are available for Mac. Good luck...\n", "Q: Iphone 4 won't turn on and home button does not work My iPhone is dead in black screen.\nI was walking on the street when it was the last time i used the iphone normally. The next time back home, i realized that after trying to use the phone again by pressing just once on the turn on/ wake button, the phone was dead.

Then i heard someone calling or sending me a message.\nI have watched and read lots of tutorials where most of them say it can be solved by pressing on both the home and turn on buttons at the same time for about 6 - 20 seconds... but my problem is that the home button does not work at all since long time ago. So i can't try that possibility :/\nHow can i get it back working? Any ideas?\n\nA: I went to a shop where there is a specialized department for iphone/ipad repairments (as suggested by @Tetsuiin). They told me the display was no longer working and it had to be replaced. They also replaced the home button. Now i got my iphone 4 back working like a charm again.\nBy the way, i have noticed that my battery lasts more time. Looks like this new display uses less energy ;)\n\nA: One thing I would recommend you doing is connect your iPhone to a computer and download Recboot from here. This tool allows you to go into recovery mode and get out of it should fix the problem. If not, restore from iTunes.\n\nA: Another solution a colleague did at my iPhone4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use medical alcohol at a very high percent rate, e.g. > 80%\n\n*Be sure your iPhone is switched OFF.\n\n*Take a pipette and pour a good amount of alcohol on your Home button, so the alcohol can creep in the slit. Do not drown it! The alcohol must NOT get in the dock connector!\n\n*Wait 3mins.\n\n*Start hitting and releasing the Home button at least 100 times, starting slow and with a little force, lessening force when it gets lighter...\n\n\nIf you are done and have the feeling, the Home button is fully functional again, let your iPhone lie on the table for 1-2h, power it on and - tadaaaaa! - you have your Home button back. :)\n\nA: Did you try doing hard reset your device ? Most of the issues are fixed by hard reset and Many people found that it solves minor bugs too. If you tried it and still facing then you might need to try to take it to Apple Care or just try installing firmware by entering into recovery mode with help of Recboot.\n", "Q: Caveats and which upgrade path from Mountain Lion My 2010 i7 iMac running off an internal SSD is currently on OS X 10.8.5.

I have opted instead to use Media Converter - a free application - with a preset (Re-wrap AVCHD for Quicktime - uncompressed Audio) to enable iMovie v9 to utilise the files. I also do not like the way the new iMovie utilises an iPhoto-esque hide inside way of dealing with movies. That it doesn't convert existing events just ices the cake. My preference is for how iMovie v9, Lightroom etc work.\nWith regards other software I have had to switch from Zevo (no longer maintained) to Open ZFS. The latter doesn't auto-mount the drives but the switch is a blessing in disguise. It is actively maintained and utilised less CPU for the same work.\nParallels is fine as long as you've updated to the latest version. MS Office is all good. The iLife and iWork suites update but leave behind the previous versions which is a nice touch. I am yet to find any issues. I am not a major user of iCloud other than appointments/reminders which is all good.\nPlease feel free to tag onto this posting with notes of issues you have found. iMovie is my only item of note.\n", "Q: Built-in display resolution resets when connecting to external monitor I have my Retina Macbook Pro's built-in display set to the scaled resolution \"more space\" in System Preferences. Whenever I connect to an external monitor (extended mode), the resolution resets to \"default\". I have to manually change it back to a larger resolution. Is there anyway to lock it on the correct resolution and prevent this behavior? \n\nA: I have got the same problem. It is not that big of a deal to change it everytime, but it still is pretty annoying.\nSometimes it doesn't happen, but most of the times it does.\nThis morning when I turned on my macbook, it started in my \"more space\" resolution.\nWhen I connected my second screen, display mirroring was turned on (something I never use and don't want). When I turned off display mirroring, my Macbook display went to the default resolution. I changed it back to \"more space\".\nThen I unplugged the second monitor. After my Macbook's screen went black, it returned in the default resolution again. I changed it back to \"more space\".\nThen I replugged my second monitor and this time it remembered my \"more space\" setting. I then unplugged the second monitor again and again it remembered by \"more space\" setting.\nIt seems as though it remembers the settings until I completely shut down my Macbook. Then, it reverts to the default settings (and sometimes randomly turns on display mirroring).\nI have to test this thesis more to see if I am correct.\n", "Q: Why did my Mac reboot into the \"Set up your new Mac\" screen after a power failure? I accidentally turned off the power strip that my iMac was plugged into while it was still running. When I turned it back on again, it put me at the \"Set up your new Mac\" screen, asking me to accept the Terms and Conditions and create a new user account.\nI held off on doing so for a while because I was afraid that setting up a new user would erase my home folder and thus all my data. After trying several times to boot normally and failing, I eventually gave in and created a new account under a fake name.\nOnce I was in, I was able to select and log in to my original account from the drop-down menu on the top right of the taskbar. Thankfully, my original user account and all my data was still there.\nWhat happened? Why wasn't I able to just boot normally after the power failure?\n\nA: At boot, it was having a problem in finding any users accounts, so it offered to create a new one.\nIn process of doing so, it repaired it self when it found out there are already users.\n", "Q: How can I retain geotagging information on my iPhone pictures? Most of my phone's memory (almost 11 GB's of it) resides in my pictures and videos. I want to clear most of it but not even my completely empty iCloud storage can handle all of it. Anyways, when you're looking at your photos and you zoom out into \"years\" and you click one of those years, a big map will pop out and you'll literally see every single place you've taken these pictures at. I think that's really cool since I went to a lot of places last summer and in general think it's a cool feature. Back to the point, is there any way I could save that location information when I export these pictures to my laptop? Would a copy/paste just be sufficient? I don't have a Mac either, so I don't know if it will be harder or impossible. And if it is possible, is there some sort of app that you can use on your laptop to pull up that same view you have on your iPhone and see everywhere you took your pictures?\n\nA: You can just copy those images. Those location information is coded into EXIF data. It will not be deleted upon transfer.\n", "Q: App Store not launching I have a Mac 2009 mid-model running OS X 10.9.4. When i click the App Store icon in the dock nothing  happens. And I am not able to download or update my applications.\nMy firewall is off.\n\nA: Since it is not clear what is not working I recommend following steps:\nTrash that Dock Icon, then go to Finder applications and start it from there.\nOr use iTunes to access it.\nOnce running right click and keep in Dock.\nPossibly just use Disk Utility and restore/Repair preferences settings.\nIf it still not working, try with new preferences files.\nFind them in  ~/Library/Preferences/\ncom.apple.storeagent.plist\ncom.apple.appstore.plist\n\nQuit all applications on your Mac, delete the two files above, and reboot your Mac.\nIf still not working use cmd+r to restore your OS installation..\n", "Q: Moving iOS Notes into OS X Notes I'd like to do a few things, either:\n\n*\n\n*Safely move my iOS notes to the OS X Notes app\nThat is, sync my existing notes with the OSX Notes app and then delete the couple of thousand notes from the iOS app. I assume this would be done via iCloud, but I'm not sure how to save my notes permanently on my Mac and subsequently delete them off my iPhone.\n\n\n*Mass email my existing notes into Evernote\nI've found plenty of suggestions on how to sync any new notes with Evernote or the OS X Notes app, but nothing about moving existing notes.\n(I've tried exporting them with iExplorer and CopyTrans but I instantly noticed that a lot of notes were missing, so it's not the most reliable option. And given that since iOS 7 you can't even see your notes count, I have no way of knowing if the number of notes that other exporting apps - such as PhoneView - show the real amount.)\nThe majority of them are important academic notes and I absolutely need to get them off my iPhone onto my Mac, but it seems a lot more difficult than it should be.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I just realised I have the same issue.\nBut using the new Dropbox feature to save app documents to your Dropbox.\n\nWhat's New in Version 3.7 • New Action Extension for iOS 8: save files\n  straight to Dropbox from your favorite apps\n\nI can now get all my iPhone notes over and into Notes.app on the Mac.

This is really handy because it allows us to keep most of the formatting from the original notes. The reason I do the conversion from html to text in the script is just to cleanly get the first paragraph, which will be used for the notes name.\nHope this helps. And note that this can be adapted to be used with any other way you choose to get the note text file onto your Mac, i.e email rule, Script Editor.app or like me Hazel as I find it is more responsive than the built in folder actions. \n\nHere is the adapted script for Hazel:\nset bodyText to (do shell script \"cat \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of theFile))\nset theName to paragraph 1 of (do shell script \"cat \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of theFile) & \" |textutil -format html -convert txt -stdin -stdout\")\ntell application \"Notes\"\n    activate\n    set theContainerFolder to container of first note\n    make new note at theContainerFolder with properties {body:bodyText, name:theName}\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Apple Yosemite Server configure secure website I am running Server 4.0.3 on a Mac Mini running Yosemite 10.10.2 and am having trouble with setting up a secure website.\nIn my DNS, I have a primary zone with a machine record for my website,e.g. www.abccompany.com. In the website settings on Server, in addition to the default website of Server Website and Server Website (SSL), I have my website, www.abccompany.com for all addresses on port 80. I can access this from both within my lan and from the wan.\nI have added an additional site for www.abccompany.com but as a secure website on port 443.

Also check whether you are using NAT, i.e., whether you connect to the Internet via NAT (check whether your router is configured to use NAT).  If you are, you will either need to configure port forwarding in the router, or find hosting for your website that is externally accessible from the Internet.\n", "Q: color picker magnifying glass missing I am running Yosemite and the color picker is supposed to have a magnifying glass.

I have got a MacBook Pro. I want to see all available drives on the computer. The computer cannot boot into OS X.\nI only know Windows PE Bootable drive. I have created a USB. How do I boot on a USB in Mac?\n\nA: Though it may be possible to create and boot a WinPE thumb drive on a Mac, the purpose of WinPE (or WinRE) is custom-tailored to the needs of admins/users of Windows systems/software/file systems.\nApple (and your Mac) provides its own measures to diagnose your hard- and software, so there is no need to create a Windows PE Bootable USB-thumb drive.\nDepending on your Mac and your installed system you may:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot to your Recovery HD (hit cmdR immediately after the start-up chime) \n\n*boot to Internet Recovery Mode (hit altcmdR immediately after the start-up chime).

For example, I want to calculate the running total in E column. I have an amount in E3. The spreadsheet will need to subtract the amount in C4 and add the amount in D4 to achieve the current amount.\nEverytime I've tried to do this I've received an error message.\n\nA: Just a guess: Try entering the formula without the = sign.\nThis sounds like the most irritating problem I had with Numbers: When you enter a formula, often it 'helps' by reformatting the = sign you entered into a pretty icon for an equals sign. Which I looked at and said \"This is where my formula goes\", so I entered \"=E3-C4+D4\" (or whatever your equation should be).\nThe problem is, now there are two (==) equals signs (because the iconic one really counted as part of the equation), and it gave me an obscure formula error.

My 5th gen. iPod is disabled because my son tried too many wrong passwords. How do I unlock it without a computer or iTunes. I just want to restore, there's nothing important on the iPod.\nI've already tried holding power button with home button at the same time.\n\nA: You need iTunes to restore an iOS device. It doesn't have to be your computer—any computer from friends/family will will do.\nIf Find My iPhone is enabled on the iPod and the iPod is connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can log in to iCloud and erase the iPod. Once the iPod is erased, you can sign in with your Apple ID to deactivate Activation Lock and set up the iPod as new.\n", "Q: Where did music scan go on my iOS 4.2 iPod Touch 2nd Gen?

I can't find anything about it. The slider used to be near the top. I only have the standard fast-forward/rewind buttons now.\n\nA: Have you tried tapping the album art while the music or podcast is playing?

For example on steam; \"Crusader Kings II\", \"The Talos Principle\".\nSo i have no ability to switch to another application like Safari when needed unless I quit the game. This is very inconvenient. \nI also tried Cmd+ H  and  Cmd+ Alt +H, they do not work either.\nCmd+ Alt +Esc force quits the game immediately.\n\nA: Command+Tab doesn't work because the game is running  in Full Screen. \nIn most games you can enable Window Mode within the game's Preferences and / or switch between Window Mode and Full Screen with a shortcut.\nAs for my experience, doing Command+M tends to do the trick.\n", "Q: How much data has been written to my SSD over its lifetime? Is there a Terminal command which will show me how many GB has been written to my SSD through the whole lifetime of the disk? I'm asking because I want to find out how many cycles have been done. SSD are able to do about 1000–2000 cycles depending on type.\n\nA: The original post mentions that SSDs have a 1000-2000 cycle limit, which over-simplifies the problem.  Individual cells in an SSD may have such a limit, but the SSD implements many different solutions: from over-provisioning and write-levelling to Sandforce's proprietary collection of de-duplication, compression, and data differencing techniques, which it calls \"DuraWrite\".\nBack to the original post: techniques like iostat, while relevant, show aggregate activity but it's very hard to work backwards to knowing how many program/erase cycles were performed for each cell, and from there, how much life remains on the SSD.  \nA useful recommendation might be to avoid filling SSDs to within 20% or so of their stated capacity, and to avoid deploying used SSDs without adequate backup.\nArs Technica has a couple of really useful articles on how SSDs work.  Most directly useful is this:  \"Consumer-grade SSDs actually last a hell of a long time\".

Since it's an iPad 1, I have had trouble finding information online.\nDid Google or Apple stop supporting the app? Is it finally obsolete? Is there another app I could use that works on iOS 5?\nJust to be clear, I did not tinker with my device. I did not change its parameters, I did not jailbreak it, it connects to the Internet just fine and I've tried the app on different Internet connections. Also, this is not a login problem, the app just refuses to let me browse videos, whether I'm logged in or not.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Solution (Seems Bullet Proof)\nNote: It is not a network issue, it is software.  Native YouTube App worked on 3st gen iPhone OS 5.1.1 on same network where iPad 1 OS 5.1.1 did not.\nI tried all suggestions found on internet and after 2 days I found no more options to try. This issue goes back years and no help from Apple! F..kng Frustrating!!! \nBut I learned enough from those suggestions to come up with this solution below.\nWarning: I have only tried this with (2) iPad1 (mine and a friend) which is why I wrote \"seems\" bullet proof.  Also, you must only use the PC which is tied to your device.  The native YouTube device will be repaired BUT not all of your other apps will be restored if you use a different computer. If this happens, then simply reinstall each app on your device through the app store. (When I did this on my friends iPad the apps had not lost their data...Woo Whoo!)\nLet's Get Started.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iPad 1\n\n*Download legacy OS ( In my case it was OS 5.1.1)\n\n*Easiest way is to open it in iTunes rather than save it to your computer\n\n*Plug your device in and open iTunes. \n\n*When your device appears, click on restore. It should now display the version of the OS you just downloaded.  (When I first tried this, iTunes wanted to upgrade my iPad 1 to OS6.1 which deletes the native iTunes app)\n\n*When the reinstall is complete iTunes should ask you if you want to restore or configure a new install. (tell it to restore the copy you saved in step 1)\n\n*Enjoy a fully functioning Native YouTube App, with Favorites restored as well.\n\n\nNo guarantees of course, but I hope this helps. \n\nA: YouTube has stopped supporting the native iPad YouTube app, but if you turn off YouTube in Settings -> General -> Restrictions you can watch YouTube videos in the Safari web browser by vistiting youtube.com. It can be a bit crashy though on the old iPad 1 browser.\nYou may also be able to install an older version of the YouTube app from the app store which will work on the iPad 1. (I think this depends on whether you've ever downloaded that old version of the YouTube app in the past on another device.)\n\nA: The app no longer is updating or working.\nI have an iPhone 4 on iOS 5.1.1 and kept it that way because I liked the native YouTube and native maps.  Tried to resynch, reboot, wifi, empty cache, etc.  none of it worked. Always got the same \"cannot connect to YouTube.\" stopped working about two weeks ago. Very sad. Really liked the layout, liked being ad free, and liked not having recommended videos.  Good ole YouTube had a simple \"most popular\" list and a simple search bar.  It was great while it lasted.  Current YouTube is so much worse.  \n\nA: I have an original iPad with the YouTube app. I have just tested it. It works !\nThe YouTube servers may be doing some dirty selection on guessed location.\nCome to Europe with your iPad and try !\n\nA: I have just restored my wife's Ipad IOS 5.1.1 and have now got a working Youtube app again complete with all old favorites. What a relief.\n\nA: I reset my wife's iPad 1 to factory defaults and now YouTube is working again.

Below is a list of steps that I want to take, but I first want to make sure that I'm not doing anything destructive, which is why I'm posting this question. :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*The Python.framework folder is located in /System/Library/Frameworks. Is it okay to remove it? Being under System I worry that I might break something.\n\n*Remove all Python related files from /usr/bin. In my case (and probably everyone else's), I'll be removing everything given by ls -l /usr/bin | grep python:\n\n\n*\n\n*python\n\n*python-config\n\n*python2.6\n\n*python2.6-config\n\n*python2.7\n\n*python2.7-config\n\n*pythonw\n\n*pythonw2.6\n\n*pythonw2.7\n\n\n*In my case I also have pip installed. The only reference to pip I found is in /usr/local/bin. To also uninstall pip I'll delete the files given by ls -l /usr/local/bin | grep pip:\n\n\n*\n\n*pip\n\n*pip2\n\n*pip2.7\nIs there anything else that I should be doing to do a complete and correct uninstall? Are there any dangers that I should be aware of?\n\nA: What you're doing is destructive. Each apple update can and will either break or re-introduce parts or all of the python files to are about to delete.\nWhy don't you simply change your path so that the homebrew version of the tool is used?\nThe danger of hacking the core OS is that it's tightly bound into receipts and software update by Apple and you risk compromising the stability of the system when you're modifying it. Generally the skill level needed to augment the path is far, far less than that needed to continually manage and troubleshoot a custom OS where you've removed components from outside /Applications .\n\nYou can delete the pip files from /usr/local/bin since they are not Apple or system installed and you can re-download them or re-install them with brew once you pick your version of choice there.\n", "Q: Remove Bootcamp when Boot Camp Assist will not I purchased an iMac from a buddy and recently upgraded to Yosemite so I am learning as I go about Macs.

I'm at a total loss and don't feel like I've answered anything. Would love to get more insight into this.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I discovered that my iPhone 5S was connected via Wi-fi. Once I disconnected it, control of everything in iTunes returned.\n\nA: According to your screenshot, your sort order is with the numbers (position).  I feel bad to ask, but what happens if you clicked on the header for \"Name\", \"Artist\" or \"Album\"?  Does that sort them by name, artist and album respectively?\n\nA: So here's what I did to shuffle the order of my playlist.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all the songs you want in the playlist\n\n*Edit all their info so they have a matching category (artist, album, grouping, etc.)\n\n*Create a smart playlist with the rule to include all items containing whatever matching info you chose.\n\n*Select the limit to [any number higher than the number of songs in your playlist] items option with items selected by random\n\n*Select OK\n\n*You should have a smart playlist with randomized order. You can now copy this to a regular playlist if you'd prefer not to use a smart playlist\n\nA: I finally found the easy way to do this - on the top right corner you have a drop down list often set to 'Songs' or 'Playlist'. Just enter this menu and you can see the option 'Sort by'. Select 'Playlist order'. That should do it!\n\nA: Go into edit and put say 1 of 5, 2 of 5, 3 of 5 and so on in compilation. It took me ages to work this out. Worked for me.\n", "Q: Contacts on iPhone 6 will not merge with Cloud I recently purchased and iPhone 6 and sync'd my data appropriately.  However, all of my contacts were apparently still associated with my old work email.  I have since moved on to another job and had to delete that email address - and with it - there went all my contacts.  Through the current contacts app, I only have anything I have added after I deleted that work email address.  I even tried resetting it from a previous backup from my computer, not iCloud.\nHOWEVER, when I go to text and type in a letter, all my old contacts show up as options with their correct names, etc.  So clearly this information is on the phone.\nIs there a way to get the contacts that are somewhere deep in the phone where the messaging software is accessing it, and then merge it to iCloud?  \nI've already tried turning iCloud on and off and remerging.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.\n\nA: The contacts can be cached on the phone hence why they show up if you search for them, although they are not going to be retrievable. The easiest way to get the contacts back will be importing the v-card files into iCloud.com/contacts under the settings, there is an import button.\nDid you have the email account synced to any applications that are on a computer? For example in a mail application or outlook application, digging through them might allow you to pull the card files up. \nAnother alternative is to go through the cache on the phone, and start typing them into the contacts application on a computer / iCloud, but thats a pain staking way to do things.\nOne theoretical way to get the contact files out of the unit would be to use a backup extractor, that can look at the database files of the cache, and pull the contacts out, you would have to do some searching to locate an application like this, although there should be some on the market (http://supercrazyawesome.com) \n", "Q: When did the colon character : become an allowed character in the filesystem? Just noticed it works on Maverick.. the colon character : is valid for file and directory names (I accidentally entered it for a filename in Atom).\nCan't find any reference to it becoming valid though (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System still marks it as invalid).\nIt works in the Atom editor.\nI can create a file called : with nano.\nThis works echo 'test' > : && cat :\nIn TextWrangler it only works if the file already exists but won't create it (with command line tools installed edit :)\nIs this new from Mavericks? Works in Yosemite? Before?\nEdit: A few more tests: \n\n\n*\n\n*TextEdit won't allow me to enter it and always replace it with -\n\n*Finder won't allow me to create a folder with the name :\n\n\n*A : file created via command line is displayed as / in Finder.. and double clicking it will open it in TextEdit. TextEdit will load its content but show the name / in the title bar.\n\nA: This change appeared at the beginning of MacOS X (i.e. MacOS X 10).\nThen the directory separator from HFS :\nwas changed to the directory separator of UFS /. Since then the Finder is in charge of making the following mapping:\n/ → :\n: → /\n\n\nA: This is due to the difference in command line and GUI.  As pointed out in the above comment, colon (\":\") is allowed in UNIX/BSD since the directory delimiter is slash (\"/\").  In the GUI, the delimiter is colon and slash is allowed as a character for a file.\nMac OS X interchanges those characters depending on where you view them.\nSo, if a file is viewed in command-line, it shows colon.  If it is viewed in the GUI (e.g. Finder or TextWrangler), it shows slash.\nIn other words: You could use TextWrangler to create a file named \"/\" and then later view that same file in command-line, where it would be displayed as \":\".\nGenerally, I would avoid using either of the characters, if not required by a specific naming convention.  In the end, it is a file name and does not affect the contents of that file. Using an underscore (oldskool) or a space character would be recommended.\n", "Q: Abnormal behavior of web browser in OS X I am using OS X  10.9.5\nWhen every I click in any browser, it creates a new tab with some site like \"www.detoxmymac.com\".\nIt seems that the computer is full of processes running while I run any browser. Consumes huge power. How can I stop it.\n\nA: In addition to running anti-virus software, as mentioned by Steve, above, you should check and clean out your browser's cache and extensions. \n(1) Safari\n\nSafari --> Help --> Installed Plug-ins\n\nHere, plug-ins called \"Quicktime\" and \"Flash\" are OK, and are not likely culprits.\n\nSafari --> Safari --> Preferences --> Extensions\n\nHere, think long and hard about whether you actually need the services offered by any extension here.  If you do, check you've got the latest and disable or delete the rest.\n\nSafari --> Safari --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Proxies\n\nHere, check to see if there are any proxies, which are instructions to visit some other site before going to the site you wish to visit.   Sometimes proxies are needed to get past restrictions put on you by your ISP, like the hotel you're staying at, but they're uniquely positioned to redirect you anywhere, and to pop open new web pages.  \n(2) Chrome\n\nChrome --> Preferences... --> Extensions\n\nCheck here for any extension you don't recognize.  Disable or delete anything you don't need.\n\nChrome --> Preferences... --> Settings -- > Search\n\nSet your search engine to something you recognize and trust.  If you're in doubt, use \"Google\" or \"DuckDuckGo\" or even \"Yahoo!\" and delete the rest.\n\nChrome --> Preferences... --> Settings -- > Show advanced settings... --> Network\n\nClick here to look at your proxy settings.  Unless you need a proxy because you travel a lot, or you live in a repressive country, or your computer is part of an enterprise network, you probably don't need a proxy.\n\nA: First, it is likely your Mac has been taken over by some malware, possibly from the website you mentioned.\nTry booting into safe mode, reboot while holding the shift key, eventually the Mac startup screen will show safe mode. Booting into safe mode can take a lot longer than normal due to all the disk/file checks run at boot, so just let it work.\nThis turns off a lot of things (pretty much everything that doesn't come with the O/S, and some that do). Once you are booted to the desktop try Safari then.\nThe problem with spyware and Malware it is often difficult to remove and anti-virus Apps don't always get rid of the damn things. MacWorld UK had an interesting article on A/V for the Mac here.\nProbably a good place to start. I would also Google that website and see if there is any malware specifically related to it with instructions to remove it.\nI would be really tempted to manually back up any documents needed, boot the Mac into recovery mode and wipe the drive and start over from scratch. It might be a bit less nerve wracking...\n", "Q: I can't create a second partition in Mac When I go to my disk utility, my main hard gives me results like this\n\nIt's showing capacity 499gb but only remaining 10mb. Now please see the second image\n\nWhat's happening with my Mac?\n\nA: Actually you have a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group on your physical disk named \"Macintosh HD\" containing a Logical Volume also named \"Macintosh HD\". The latter is the volume usually visible on your desktop (depending on your Finder settings). The Logical Volume Group already extends across your whole physical disk except an invisible EFI partition (200 MB) and an invisible Recovery HD (~650 MB).\nThe Logical Volume (499 GB with 456 GB free space) extends across your whole Logical Volume Group.\nAs a result you can't create a second partition (including the invisible partitions in fact a forth) because you have no unallocated space on your physical disk.\nTo create a second partition you have to resize the whole CoreStorage stack to create a non-CoreStorage volume or resize the Logical Volume to create a second CoreStorage Logical Volume first.\n"]
