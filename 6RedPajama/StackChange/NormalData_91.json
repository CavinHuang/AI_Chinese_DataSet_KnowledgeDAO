["Q: How can I set up Evolution to access a local mail box? Often, when I start up a new terminal, I get the message:\nNo mail for pwnguin, or You have 5 unread messages. I'm not terribly great with mail, but I do have a running instance of Evolution connecting to a Zimbra account. How can I set up Evolution to also monitor this local inbox?\n\nA: This answer follows the premise that you're using a mail spool, if its mbox format your mileage may vary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Evolution, then go to Tools -> Settings.\n\n*Click Mail Accounts -> Add -> Forward.\n\n*Type in a name in the Full Name field.\n\n*For the Email Address field, type in your login ID followed by @localhost. For example: lazypower@localhost Click Forward.\n\n*Click on the drop down list box and select Local delivery. If the Path field in the Configuration section isn't already filled in, you'll need to type in the location of your local mailbox. Using the login ID from above as an example, here's what would be entered: /var/spool/mail/lazypower Click Forward.\n\n*If you like, you can setup Evolution to automatically check this\nmail account. Click Forward.\n\n*You're not going to be sending mail with this account, so you could just leave everything alone in the Sending Email window. However, I change the Server Type to Sendmail. Click Forward.\n\n*Finally, enter a name for the mail account. The name \"Local Messages\" is a good choice. Click Forward and Apply.\n\n\nThanks go to this post I've verified the instructions locally. Works without a hitch.\n\nA: Try using localhost for all server names (incoming/outgoing mail server,etc) in evolution and then the usual usernames and passwords. The email address will probably also follow the username@localhost format.\n", "Q: Why was Qt chosen for unity-2d and Nux for 3d? I would just like to know the reason(s) behind this decision (Pros./Cons. of using Qt and NUX). Thank you very much and keep on the awesome work! Ubuntu rocks! :D\n\nA: Nux wasn't exactly chosen - it was created from scratch and is developed alongside Unity. For some information on what it is and the benefits see this posting from Unity developer Jason Smith. Also there is a question that goes into much more detail on the inner workings of Nux.\nQt has recently been praised by Canonical's Matt Zimmerman on his blog for being stable on ARM platforms as well as x86; for being cross platform; and for having a mature touch input system.\nI know this doesn't completely answer your question but it gives some insight into reasoning behind these decisions.\n", "Q: How can I share my desktop using Skype? I'm running Ubuntu Lucid Netbook Remix on my laptop and I need to be able to share my desktop for a Skype call. Does anyone know how to get this done?\n\nA: When you are in a video call, you can share your desktop by click on the video button (as in the picture) then click share your screen>choose what to share.\n\n\nA: With the latest version of Skype for Ubuntu, sharing your screen is activated differently.\nYou can either:\nIn a call: hit the + button in the call window > Share screens\nOr...\nRight click on a contact name > Share your screen... > Share full screen or Share selection\n\nA: With Skype 4.3.0.37 I have found that you - apart from finding the right menu item in Skype - also need to be on a connection with sufficient speed. Otherwise transmission will be very slow or freezes, as if congestion occurs.\nWhen I was on my private fairly low-speed ASDL connection screen sharing did not work, but when I switched to a fast university connection there was no problem with Skype screen sharing from my Ubuntu Linux to a Windows computer.\n", "Q: Disk failure is imminent (laptop hard drive, ~5 months old) There's another post about this, but I don't have enough 'points' to say anything on that thread.

What steps can I take to backup my important information, which is probably the home folder.  Please include steps to recover my data on the new hard drive as well.  It does me little good to have backups I can't use.\n\nA: If your hard drive has problems with SMART and fails to run tests you need to replace it, and soon. EXT4 didn't kill your hard drive, it had some kind of physical damage.\nThis link contains some information on cloning a hard drive, though I would suggest if possible you find a professional to help you (since it is a damaged - laptop - hard drive.) If you don't want to go that route you can use an external drive, get a new internal drive (install ubuntu on it) and copy your data to the external -> and then to the new drive.\n", "Q: What are the accessibility problems of Qt? Jonathan Ridell said in a blog post that there were accessibility problems with Qt. I would just like to know what those problems are. Thank you very much and keep up the excelent work. Ubuntu Rocks!\n\nA: I haven't done any development in Qt, but my gloss on the subject of accessibility there is that the concern might be a bit overblown.  My understanding is that while GTK has built-in ATK support, Qt has to use a 'bridge' component to tie its native system to the accepted Linux accessibility framework. \nUpdate -- I might have been premature in calling this issue overblown.  For instance, as user9237 says, it doesn't look like AT-SPI was really ever implemented.  So the trolltech doc quoted looks to be a bit \"optimistic\" .\nHere is an interesting blog post, unfortunately still a bit old, covering a lot of these issues : Qt/KDE and the state of free accessibility.  \nHere's Mark Doffman's code site for Qt AT-SPI.  Of which he says, \n\nThis project is a Qt plugin that\n  bridges the QAccessible API’s to the\n  AT-SPI 2 protocol enabling Qt\n  applications to be used with Orca,\n  Accerciser, and GOK.\n\nThe possibly bogus Trolltech/Nokia link:\n\nHere's what Qt docs say about Qt\n  accessibility (from\n  trolltech/nokia):\n\nAccessibility support in Qt consists of a generic interface, implemented\n    for a technology >on each platform:\n    MSAA on Windows, Mac OS X\n    accessibility on the Mac, and Unix/X11\n    AT-SPI >on Linux. Qt's accessibility\n    interface closely follows the MSAA\n    (Microsoft Active >Accessibility)\n    standard, which most clients support.\n    Other technologies used by Qt >provide\n    similar functionality.*\n\n\nA slightly newer document gives an overview of Qt accessibility. \nBy contrast, here's a quick run-down on accessibility interfaces  from the Gnome project:\nGAIL (GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library) is an implementation of the accessibility interfaces defined by ATK. GTK is a toolkit which is already mapped to ATK by the GAIL module. License, download and other information can be found here. The GAIL source code also serves as an excellent tutorial for advanced ATK usage. In addition, you may be interested in the GAIL Reference Manual.\n\nA: The quote in the first answer seems incorrect http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/accessible.html\n\"Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) on Windows and Mac OS X Accessibility on Mac OS X. On Unix/X11, support is preliminary.\"\nAT-SPI support was never implemented for Qt on Linux (because it would require writing CORBA bindings).  dbus AT-SPI is now available and could be implemented if someone had the time, sadly nobody has so far.\n\nA: Accessibility on Linux used to be a problem for Qt due to the AT-SPI support requiring CORBA.\nThis is now fixed: starting with Ubuntu 11.10, Qt comes with accessibility support based on the dbus AT-SPI. Accessibility is available for classic QWidget-based applications as well as QML applications.\n", "Q: \"Folder sharing\" says \"Share name is too long\"... for what? Most of the time when I share a folder from Ubuntu, the name field is made yellow and it says \"Share name too long\".  But even if I keep this name, it works fine.  So what is it too long for?  What is the limit?\n\n\nA: There is a bug in the dialogue. Add another character and you'll notice the warning disappears!\nThe warning is there because some systems that can access Samba filesystems also have fairly extreme filename-length limits. For example you can connect to a SMB server with Windows 3.11 which has the same file restrictions as DOS.\nSamba will still host the share but other people might not be able to see it. Similar rules apply if you stick restricted character (eg: a question mark) in the share name. Other POSIX systems will cope. Windows will fall over.\n", "Q: Multiple monitors, multiple workspaces? I connected my laptop to my LCD. Using the laptop display hotkey I can switch between different modes - only laptop monitor on, only LCD monitor on, both on and display the same view, both on and the desktop is stretched (divided).\nBut, I'm looking for something else - I would like to have two workspaces, one visible on the laptop monitor and the other on the LCD.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: It is possible to archive something similar using nVidia (prop) driver (Ge-Force graphics cards). It is called \"TwinView\". I only tried it once. You may want to read more here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174\nI was not able to achieve the same result using an ATI graphics card.\n\nA: In Gnome\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\nsudo gnome-tweaks\n\nin the workspaces tab under \"display handling\" select \"workspaces span displays\" which means all the screens to act together. (when you switch on one, others will switch to that workspace as well)\nyou can select whether all the screens act together or individually \nto switch between workspaces press ALT + CTRL +UP_ARROW/DOWN_ARROW.\n\nA: If I understand the question correctly, you would like to be able to switch workspaces independently for each screen, so that for example the left screen could be on workspace 1 and the right screen on workspace 3. This is supported by some window managers, most notably XMonad, and I personally find it extremely convenient in a dual-head setup. Moreover, it's perfectly possible to integrate XMonad with GNOME without sacrificing usability.\nOn my home machine I currently have a much simpler setup, with the default window manager. I like to have a music player visible on one of the screens at all times, so I just pinned the player to the visible workplace in order to emulate a “separate workspace”. This doesn't really solve a problem, but might be helpful anyway.\n\nA: I guess what we (or at least I) really want is to get the top & bottom panels on both monitors and have the bottom panel's application tabs only on the corresponding monitor.\nLooks like it's not there yet but we can vote for it on ubuntu brainstorm.\n\nA: This guy has a working xorg.conf for multiple cards multiple desktops using a displaylink usb adapter: http://mulchman.org/blog/?tag=displaylink\n", "Q: Unreadable characters in programs (graphic glitch) A picture is worth a thousand words...\nScreenshot (gVim) -\n\nScreenshot (LibreOffice) -\n\nThe Appearance Preferences dialog -\n\nAnyone know what causes it and how it can be fixed?\nIf it's relevant - the system runs on an AMD Turion and a GeForce Go 6100. I have a feeling it's got something to do with video memory. Although I could be wrong.\n\nA: Had a similar issue, this might help:\nFirst, check in Jockey that your graphic card's driver is up and running - sometimes it will show a green light but say \"not in use\". If that is the case, you need to completely purge you graphic cards driver and then re-install.\nI recommend not using jockey to install as, for some reason, that was what led to the bug for me.\nSee this thread on the ubuntu forums for more information regarding your graphics card and how to purge/re-install the drivers: \nForum post: Nvidia driver activated but not currently in use (11.04)\nPS: I would recommend reinstalling your graphic drivers even if jockey says it is fine, it seems like a gpu issue.\n\nA: I don't know if this is your problem or not, but I had a refresh problem with gVim when I was using Compiz until I did the following: Open CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm), then enable the Workarounds plugin, and in its setting, check the box for \"Qt Window Fix\".\n", "Q: Why can't I purge apache2.2-bin and apache2.2-common? I have tried to completely remove apache2.2 from my system. But the only thing that happens is that apt-get will remove \"apache2-mpm-prefork\" and install \"apache2-mpm-worker\".\nI have killed all apache processes and tried in both Synaptic. and apt-get from terminal. Why won't my system delete apache, and why will it install \"apache2-mpm-worker\"?\n\nA: Short answer: you need to purge the apache2 package as well as apache2.2-bin and apache2.2-common. \nExplanation: this package is a \"virtual package\" - if you have it installed the system will make sure that one of apache2-mpm-event, apache2-mpm-itk or apache2-mpm-prefork or apache2-mpm-worker is installed. Note that these four packages themselves each depend apache2.2-bin and apache2.2-common. \n", "Q: Problem deleting broken files on external drive i have a 500gb external drive (Maxtor One Touch) some days ago i moved some files from the destkop to it.\nthe operation failed (on the disk there are only 4 or 5 incomplete files ) and i can't remove those files.\ni tried through nautilus and from the command line but nothing..\nany idea?\nthanks\n\nA: Unmount the drive and run sudo fsck /dev/sdb1 -f , (seems sdb1 is the partition you want to check).\nIf it's a NTFS partition, run sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb1\n\nA: If you're able to hook it up to a different computer you can delete them that way or disk defragmentate the hard drive on a Windows computer.

You can also buy t-shirts and such to help support them.\n\nA: Another aspect is in the servers for businesses \n\nA: I was wondering about this question since \"if you are not paying for the product you are the product\". The best answer seems to be that they are making money from Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) support (as explained also in this article). In summary, upgrading is a major expense for large companies who may instead opt to buy themselves time with extended support for the version of Ubuntu they are running. By releasing new versions quickly you create an 'upgrade pressure'. Clever, and fair enough.\n\nA: Let's not forget Canonical makes custom distributions of Ubuntu for corporate customers!\n\nA: There's Landscape too - to manage multiple Ubuntu installations from one place.\n\nA: Firstly a lot of people work on Ubuntu in their free time (many of them programming, but also those of here for instance answering people's questions). Also some people donate to Ubuntu.\nHowever there is more to the story. Canonical Ltd. is a private company that created and continues to pay for Ubuntu. We know Canonical hadn't been making a profit, but Canonical was initially founded by multi-millionaire Mark Shuttleworth which meant it didn't have to focus on making money right away.\nHowever Canonical is now looking towards to making Ubuntu profitable. (After all, they have 600+ employees to pay every month!) There are some indications this has been successful. Their key revenue streams offer services around Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support services (mostly to business) alongside which they sell Landscape\n\n*Contracting services to businesses (for instance working with OEMs such as Dell, or helping Google with Chrome OS). As Ubuntu makes its way onto mobile phones and TVs then this will grow.\n\n*Ubuntu Software Centre's paid section (Canonical takes a cut of purchases)\n\n*The Canonical Store (selling physical Ubuntu branded items) - discontinued\n\n*Closed-source projects wishing to use Launchpad.net can purchase a license\n\n*Ubuntu One (online file storage and synchronization service) and Music Store (selling music from within Ubuntu) - discontinued.\n\n*Amazon referrals. When you search the Ubuntu Dash, you may see Amazon products (unless you have turned it off). Ubuntu takes a cut of these.[ref]\nAll of these are areas that Canonical hopes will grow.\n", "Q: Can't set permissions for USB drives? I'm trying to set permissions for folders on USB drives that I've mounted with Nautilus, but when I change the permission, it just changes right back again.  No error message or any other explanation.  I've tried \"Open as administrator\" and it still doesn't work.  How do I set the permissions so that they can be accessed as shared folders on the network?\n\nA: The problem is that your USB stick is probably using FAT(16/32) or NTFS as file system which doesn't support permissions. That's why they change back after edit in nautilus. If you want to use permissions with USB sticks/drives, you'll need to format it to any EXT formats (use either 3 or 4) using gparted (install with synaptic).\n", "Q: Performance cost of running Ubuntu from external hard drive A friend just complained to me about Ubuntu being slow. \nAlthough I've noticed a certain lack of snappiness with Linux vs Windows in the past, I really can't say I've had much to grumble about with the recent distributions of Ubuntu. That said, his objections seem much worse than the ones I used to have and I know that his current setup is significantly more powerful than my laptop. \nAnd then it turned out he is running Ubuntu off an external HDD hooked up via USB2.0. The HD enclosure is USB3.0 but apparently he can't manage to get it to boot on USB3.0 so he switched to one of the USB2.0 ports or whatever and that works, albeit not very well.\nNow I would expect USB to add some overhead to communication between the computer and the HDD; SATA is after all designed to get the maximum out of a hard drive, whereas USB is, well, universal. \nWhat are your expreriences with booting off external HDDs?\nEdit: Does anybody know just how much of a slowdown can be expected?\n\nA: USB 2 is rubbish. There. I said it.\nIt is fairly universal and it's allowed us to get a lot of extra hardware attached to our computers but for transfer speed, it's just no good. Around 20-30MB/s would be typical in my experience.\nMight not sound terrible but an average internal drive manages 70-100MB/s and a great SATA drive can touch 300MB/s. There are of course even better products but they're prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3 is far better but although we've had drivers in Linux longer than any other platform, they're still pretty buggy in my experience. You might ask him to try upgrading the kernel to 2.6.37 and then trying USB3. The last two kernels since Maverick's 2.6.35 has had a few USB3 changes. This similarly might not fix anything - Grub could equally be the issue.\n\n*eSATA would be the ideal for an external drive. I don't know what your friend's computer has in the way of ports (or what his external disk provides), but eSATA will wipe the floor with USB 2 (probably even USB3 in real-world tests). If he has it, use it. If he has a spare PCI-E slot, perhaps a little eSATA card might be a better bet (they're quite cheap).\nSeek time will probably be the biggest improvement over Firewire (and USB3). It doesn't matter too much for storing big media but when you're buzzing between lots of small files (like the Linux boot), it makes a huge difference.\n\n*Firewire might be an option if he has that option on the drive and computer... Firewire is often criticised for being slower than USB but spec for spec, it's actually a lot faster in practice for data transfer. Seek speeds are similar.\n\n*If he has a fast network adapter and some spare cash, a network-attached-storage device might be a nice option. You can get two-drive units quite cheap that can share their files over NFS. If you have gigabit connections at each end this can translate to a fairly steady 100+MB/s\n\n*Finally, if nothing else seems like an option... Ask him why he's being such a jessy and get him to repartition. You can resize the Windows partition non-destructively (ie it stays there all warm and happy, just a bit smaller).\nJust set aside ~10gigs for the core Ubuntu install and a base profile and then just symlink big media in from the external drive. Boot time and responsiveness will improve huge amounts.\n\nA: USB's speed is just one thing. The drive's speed (read,write and rotation) will count too, if you can use a SDD. If the drive and pc supports it, you should use eSATA as it's faster than us2 (but slower than usb3).\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot system freezing? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI have a problem with my Ubuntu 10.10 system which regularly freezes and can then only be switched off via the mains switch.

You can follow the suggestion in comment #3:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the mentioned PPA to your system (using a terminal):\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev\n\n*Update the package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n*Install the mentioned package:\nsudo apt-get install linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r)\n\n*Reboot and hope for the best.\n", "Q: What are the legal consequences of customizing the LiveCD? the organization I work at wants to create a custom Ubuntu LiveCD, the customizations are: Pre-installed programs, plugins, some device drivers, and aesthetics such as icons and backgrounds, as well as changing Firefox's homepage and removing unneeded packages.\nNot big changes, obviously, and we wish to distribute this custom image for clients to use as a bootable CD or USB stick in order to have a quick environment where all our tools are available instantly.\nWhat are the licensing and legal consequences of this? What if some of the programs or plugins that are to be pre-packaged are not GPL'd?\nI should finally note that we are not changing any code in the kernel or any other distro component.\nThank you for your time!\n\nA: You might want to look over the Mozilla Trademark Policy If I recall it has some interesting rules about what you may do if you choose to call the product Mozilla Firefox.\nOh, and I am not a Lawyer, please seek legal counsel before redistributing anything with other peoples Trademarks, Copyrights, and Patents.\n\nA: Start by reading the Derivative Distro Howto.\nYou can certainly make a distribution based on Ubuntu, and as far as I know there is no specific restriction on the live CD, so you can make derivative works based on it.\nThe code isn't be a problem: as far as I know it's all freely redistribuable software, Ubuntu doesn't have any specific rights to distribute that you don't also have. But the branding — trademarks and artwork — might be. The obvious thing you should check is what you may do with the Ubuntu artwork, and how you're allowed to use the name (it's trademarked).\nA typical example of artwork and trademark-related limitation is the Iceweasel saga. The Mozilla foundation wants only “acceptable” derivatives of Firefox to have the Firefox brand, so even though the software is free software (as in free speech), the branding is not. Although the Mozilla foundation was prepared to trust Debian to make only acceptable changes, such as security fixes, they were not willing to extend that trust to others. But the Debian Free Software Guidelines specify that the “license must not be specific to Debian”, so that people in your position know that they can make derivatives. Since no acceptable compromise was found, Debian does not distribute “Firefox”, it distributes “Iceweasel” with the same code and different branding.\nUbuntu is less strict on that point, so if you want to make a derivative, you do have to check whether you may retain the branding on any component you change (starting with the distribution as a whole).\n\nA: Regarding the GPL question, yes, you can bundle GPL apps alongside non-GPL apps, as long as the latter are not derivative works of the former and you don't break the terms of the GPL apps you do ship.\nSee the relevant entry on the GPL FAQ site.\nAs other people mentioned, you may also need to consider the Ubuntu trademark policy.  Which for your case probably just means labelling the CD as a remix of Ubuntu, not Ubuntu itself.\nFor the stuff you're talking about, it sounds fine, but typical IANAL qualifications apply.\n\nA: I think if you are re-distributing it for free you do not have to do anything. But if you are trying to sell it for commercial purpose you need to care about every packages it contain with there GPL/LGPL/MPL etc license terms. And you should have a third party license documentation, where you have to list all the package it is using and give the source link such as git/svn/http url for that packages. For example if you have 5000 packages in your CD, you should write them in your license document all 5000 packages.\nSee my another answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/88430/24988\n\n\n*\n\n*Correct me if i am wrong, i am not a lawyer.

I have a bunch of pictures I'd like to make into a basic slideshow, as a video (e.g. mpeg/avi). What software is available to do this?\nI started using PiTiVi based on recommendation in another question, which seemed nice at first. However, it's very unstable - just crashed my whole system! Regardless, it won't let me do anything over 10 seconds because the timeline keeps jumping back to the start any time I try and move/resize a clip.\nAll I need is to fade between some images. Anything out there?\n\nA: I for one really like Videoporama. The latest version comes with many effects, allows you to insert videos (or only parts of a video) too as well as audio (and edit audio).\nAnother similar tool is PhotoFilmStrip.  It uses the \"Ken Burns\" effect for the pictures transitions and you can also add music and captions to your photos. \n\nA: ffmpeg -f image2 -i image%d.jpg video.mpg\n\nThis command will transform all the images from the current directory (named image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc…) to a video file named video.mpg.\n\nA: You can try imagination from the repository.\nsudo apt-get install imagination\n\nImagination is a lightweight and user-friendly DVD slide show maker with\na clean interface and few dependencies. It only requires the ffmpeg encoder\nto produce a movie to be burned with another application.\nIt currently features over 50 transition effects. Exporting the slideshow in FLV format is supported as well.\n\nA: kdenlive works for me. You can install it from repo (sudo apt-get install kdenlive), but you can compile more codecs in with ffmpeg from source and kdenlive from source.\nIt looks a bit intimidating, but you don't need to know much to make a slideshow with it. First, put all the photos you want in a folder, then do Project → Add Slideshow Clip\n\nand select that folder (there are some options for transitions and such there too). \nThen, drag that clip down onto the timeline, e.g. to \"Video 1\", and click Render, pick a file name and format and Render to file.\nIf you also want music, do Project→Add Clip and pick a song and then drag it down to the timeline. Right click the audio clip at the end of the slideshow clip and Cut clip so you don't get audio after the slideshow is done. Then Render.\n", "Q: CVS vs SVN vs GIT vs anyother CVS is being used in my workplace and I've no much knowledge of cvs other than installing and creating cvs users and I heard developers share their project with eclipse or something like that. I'm asked to check for best repositories which offers advanced features giving the hints SVN and GIT. If any one using these repositories please short list their features and if possible with links of good installation guides and a bit information of what the eclipse to do with these repositories. \nThank you!\n\nA: You need to consider what kind of repository system your team needs to function effectivly. The main difference is between:\n\n\n*\n\n*Centralised Repositories - CVS, SVN, Simple File Server, etc\n\n*Decentralised Repositories - Git, Mercurial, Bzr\n\n\nI make this distinction now, because if you move from cvs to git, you will need to read up on what it means to have decentralised repositories. The new kinds of work-flows you need to develop will make development easier and more efficient for bigger teams, but the change in workflows will make your first attempts fail as you make assumptions about how it's supposed to work.\nHere in the Ubuntu world we use Bazaar (bzr) which is a very good decentralised system written in python and based on mercurial. It's fairly easy to set up a server and the commands and extensions available are well developed. Eclipse has a very good bzr plugin. Launchpad and GNU's Savana use bzr by default and it's my personal first choice.\nGit is also another fantastic repository system. Developed by Torvalds himself after his disastrous time with a proprietary system, GIT is lightning fast and only slightly harder to use than bzr. It's used by github, gnome and several other projects as their main repository system after using svn.\nBoth are available in the Ubuntu repositories, as well as a ton of extensions.\nI wouldn't use svn or any other centralised repository unless you have a very small team and know what you're doing.\n", "Q: How do you change Window Control Position in the Unity Panel?

Ayatana indicators have been designed with consistency in mind and one of the elements of a consistent UI is permanent position of indicators.

When I tried to login to the server via ssh, I could not. Instead, I got connection refused error. I tried to ping the machine and I got reply! So, the clear reason is that SSH daemon is stopped.\nAfter reboot, I was able to login to my server via ssh.

Some people said that this is caused by the SSH daemon trying to start before networking and they suggest to change ListenAddress in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to be 0.0.0.0. I think this is not the cause in my case, because my problem occurs after system is up and running.\nAny idea what is causing this?

Should I avoid using ssh reload and use ssh restart instead?\n\nA: You should check to see what happened just before SSH started floundering in syslog. If the networking subsystem died, that could explain why sshd started failing.\nI would also check /var/log/auth.log. It's sshd's log and it might give you a better error message.\n\nA: This appears to be the result of bug #687535, which was fixed recently in natty, and has been uploaded to both maverick and lucid as a proposed update.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/openssh/+bug/687535\nI'd encourage everyone to go there, try the test case (search for TEST CASE), and post your results both before and after installing the proposed fix. That will help the SRU team decide that verification has been done and release it as an update.\n\nA: In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, make sure that all yes and no options are in lower case. For example, if you set, PermitRootLogin No, ssh will not start. It actually has to be PermitRootLogin no.\n\nA: I just had the same problem on my 12.04 box. I.e. same symptoms. Alas, it always happened when I introduced the ListenAddress clause with the inet and inet6 addresses in sshd_config. In short, this appears to be a symptom of a malformed sshd_config - although the log files didn't state anything like that.\nTroubleshooting sshd\nWhat I find generally very useful in any such cases is to start sshd without letting it daemonize. The problem in my case was that neither syslog nor auth.log showed anything meaningful.\nWhen I started it from the terminal I got:\n# $(which sshd) -Ddp 10222\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config line 8: address family must be specified before ListenAddress.\n\nMuch better! This error message allowed me to see what's wrong and fix it. Neither of the log files contained this output.\nNB: at least on Ubuntu the $(which sshd) is the best method to satisfy sshd requirement of an absolute path. Otherwise you'll get the following error: sshd re-exec requires execution with an absolute path. The -p 10222 makes sshd listen on that alternative port, overriding the configuration file - this is so that it doesn't clash with potentially running sshd instances. Make sure to choose a free port here.\nThis method has helped me many many times in finding issues, be it authentication issues or other types. To get really verbose output to stdout, use $(which sshd) -Ddddp 10222 (note the added dd to increase verbosity). For more debugging goodness check man sshd.\n\nThe main advantage of this method is that it allows you to check the sshd configuration without having to restart the sshd on the default port. Normally this should not interfere with existing SSH-connections, but I've seen it. So this allows one to validate the configuration file prior to - potentially - cutting off ones access to a remote server (for example I have that for some VPS and even for physical servers where I need to pay extra to get out-of-band access to the machine).\n\nA: I had a similar issue with an Ubuntu 11.10 image on a Linode after restarting.  ssh service would produce in syslog:\nMar 18 06:31:33 servername kernel: init: ssh main process ended, respawning\nMar 18 06:31:33 servername kernel: init: ssh main process (3419) terminated with status 255\nMar 18 06:31:33 servername kernel: init: ssh main process ended, respawning\nMar 18 06:31:33 servername kernel: init: ssh main process (3422) terminated with status 255\nMar 18 06:31:33 servername kernel: init: ssh respawning too fast, stopped\n\nIt's a test box, and it had about 60 days of uptime, so somewhere along the way, I installed something that appended to the bottom of sshd_config:\nClientAliveInterval 60\nClientCountAliveMax 60\n\nCommenting those lines allowed ssh to start.\n\nA: got same issue, upper solution doesn't work, but I've solution for this.\nroot@imt:~# sshd\nsshd re-exec requires execution with an absolute path\nssh localhost\nssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Network is unreachable\n\nPath is ok as per document, so i run manually sshd.\nroot@imt:~# /usr/sbin/sshd \n/var/run/sshd must be owned by root and not group or world-writable\n\n/var/run/sshd permission is.\nroot@imt:~# ls -ld /var/run/sshd\ndrwsrwsrwt 2 root root 40 Jan  5 12:58 /var/run/sshd\n\nroot@imt:~# chmod 755 /var/run/sshd\n\nthen its fine. run ssh localhost and check.\nroot@imt:~# ssh localhost \nThe authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is 64:93:fd:ab:4c:f9:7b:8a:86:60:22:f7:56:fa:ea:cc.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n\n\nA: Ubuntu ssh would not start and syslog yielded\n\"init: ssh main process (2044) terminated with status 255\"\n/usr/sbin/sshd -Ddp   10222   \nSure worked for me  to determine sshd_config line error\n", "Q: How to control fan speed and temperatures on Asus A8Js laptop?

I have hundreds of passwords, since I use a different random one for each website/service.\nThey are all generated & stored with KeePassX, which can be synced to different computers and my android phone via dropbox (or ubuntuone).\nI know the database of KeePassX is secure (at least with a good passphrase). \nBut what about when I am copying the password into the clipboard (where it is stored for 5 seconds)? Can any program running in user-space access the clipboard and store the password? If so, how big of a security risk is this?\n\nA: Programs may have access to the clipboard, for example you copy some text from a webpage and paste it to gedit. This should never happen without user interaction, unless KeePassX has a security vulnerability which another malware (very rare on Unix systems) could then use. Don't use software which you don't trust.\nIf you want to decrease the probability that your passwords go to someone else, encrypt your home folder, swap and ram, use a good login password, disable user name list in login manager (like gdm). That way the only possible way to get access to your passwords is when KeePassX is running, ie. when you are logged in and have some old insecure programs running.\n\nA: To exclude KeepassX from adding passwords to the clipboard history, add KeepassX to the exclude list in \nsettings -> security and privacy -> files and applications\n\nThat way, KeepassX won't be recorded in ZeitGeist or the Dash and for example Diodon, will not add passwords to the history list.\n", "Q: Where is the start up file located?

I just discovered that I couldn't add more than 4 layouts for my keyboard. Googling revealed that it was a universal limit (at least for GNU/Linux) and the only way(s) to get around it was to use some hackish way with scripts. Is there really a technical reason behind this? If yes, what is it?\n\nA: I frequently write in English, German, Swedish and Chinese.  This is four, but I am learning Russian as well and would appreciate the extra toggle via the GUI.  Scripts is a workable resolution in the meantime:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10333055#post10333055\nOne might note that with Russian, one has the option of either the 'standard' Russian keyboard layout, or a much more convenient (for those of us learning) phonetic layout paired to QWERTY.\nAlso, many of us use some form of Dvorak, which also takes a position.\nHence, my computer looks like this:\nKeyboard layouts:\nUSA\nDvorak (programmer)\nSwedish\nGerman\nRussian\nRussian phonetic\nand there is an additional keyboard icon with an ibus toggle for Chinese Pinyin.\n\nA: Quoting Peter Hutterer (Red Hat employee working on X.Org):\n\nSome information about this feature and why it hasn't been implemented yet:\n  Te 4 group limit is forced by the protocol wire format. support for more than\n  4 groups can only be added by adding additional requests and events to XKB and\n  rewriting clients to switch to this new XKB version.\n  In addition, compatibility to the old protocol must be ensured so that current\n  XKB clients will still function correctly with the new XKB version.\nThis is both complex and very time-consuming. Volunteers to tackle this problem\n  are of course very welcome.\n[...]\nIt's encoded in some bits on the protocol, with the other bits being used for\n  other information. so you need extra bytes in the requests/events for anything\n  above 4, and adding extra bytes requires bumping the protocol. And then you\n  have to deal with those clients that only understand 4 groups and what to do\n  with them if a keyboard is on group 5.\n\nWhy we don't have a hack above this layer - I don't know... this must be the lamest limitation ever. :D\n\nA: The protocol sets aside two bits for keyboard switching.  This is two more than many people need.  Most of the users I have seen switching keyboard layouts use two; a local layout and and international layout.  The international layout usually handles composition of all require keys.  This leaves one excess bit.  I have seen users with three layouts, but usually one is never used.\nI would be interested in what you are doing that requires more than four layouts, and how you work with constantly changing keymapping.  I find it difficult to get users used to two layouts, even when it solved problems they have with internationalization.\n", "Q: How can I customize my bootloader to make it prettier?

My approach requires that I could specify several GUIDs for each user (one by each folder he has write access to).\nI need to start programming this admin and I still don't know wich approach would work, if any.\nThe question is: How to give arbitrary permissions to 20 folders or so, to a large number of FTP users?\n\nA: Will ACL work for you?

As you should never run Wine as root, how do you at least give it some privileges?\nAll I've found is that you should use \"Posix Capabilities\", but I haven't been able to figure out how exactly I can do this.\n\nA: You should be able to grant the \"bind to privileged ports\" capability to Wine with:\nsudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/wine\n\nPlease let us know if it worked.\n", "Q: Simple multi-seat I've asked about multiseat before. The answer (for 10.04) involved doing it the proper way (eg through gdm, multiple server layouts). The problem was that gdm needs to be patched or reverted to 2.20 for multiseat. It's an ugly hack that, worse than anything, will hold up future updates.\nAs a result, I didn't do anything. I still have a spare video card. I still have the monitor, keyboard and mouse all sitting waiting to jump into action. And I still want to be able to turn that into a simple desktop.\nMy needs don't seem complicated. I have a second video card, a USB hub and anything connected to that USB hub that I want to be dedicated to another X server. I don't need a login screen (I'm happy hard-coding in a auto-login and I'd be happy with the user starting the X server if that's possible).\nThis is so simple in my head that I only need two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I explicitly start an X server from the command line on an unused video adapter (by passing it whatever configuration I need to)?\n\n*Can I have this new X session load a desktop environment on load?\nThis seems like something you should be able to write in a little upstart script within 10 minutes. That would be perfect for me as then I'd have a nice start/stop control over the secondary desktop from the main desktop (that I want to leave unscathed!)\nI'm thinking something as simple as this for the payload:\nsu -u other_user -c \"startx -- localhost hardware-information\"\n\nAnd use .xinitrc to load openbox or something...\n\nA: Why don't you use X server layouts, but not gdm? Or if you need a login manager, use something that doesn't kvetch about multiple instances (or whatever the problem with gdm is).

For example, I want all avi files to be associated with mplayer in Wine\nmplayer /home/user/myvideo.avi\n\nEdit from Oli: I believe this this actually the inverse of what most people would assume from the original title. Unless I'm mistaken the user is using Total Commander in Wine and would like to launch a Linux-native player on the path. If I'm wrong, just rollback this edit.\n\nA: The Wine page has some detail on this.\nFirst you need winepath to translate the path.

The first like creates a file and writes #!/bin/sh to it, the second one appends something else to the file.\n\n\n*\n\n*To get this working\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the directory bin in your home directory, either in Nautilus or by typing\nmkdir -p ~/bin\n\n\n*Create a new file ~/bin/run_linx_program (where ~ is shorthand for \"your home directory\") and put these lines into it:\n#!/bin/bash\n$1 \"`wine winepath -u \"$2\"`\"\n\nYou can create the file by doing nano ~/bin/run_linx_program, or you can use the Text Editor. \n\n*Run chmod a+x ~/bin/run_linux_program to make the file executable, alternatively you can right click the file, open the properties, go to Permissions and set 'executable'.\n\nA: Unless you actually use or need history expansion, I recommend just turning it off by adding the line\nset +H\n\nin your ~/.bashrc. I've done that and am quite happy to never be bothered by event not found messages again.\nRegardless, history expansion is only enabled for interactive shells, so it won't affect scripts.\n", "Q: No Plymouth splash on startup?

When Skype starts and tries to sign in it is unsuccessful (it shows incorrect password, in red) every time (I have provided the correct password).\nI always have to click to show contacts in groups, it does not remember it. Every time I have to go to options and update some notification settings.\nI know all these things should be \"remembered\" by Skype - this problem started only recently. I don't recall fiddling with any permissions that could have likely caused that.\nDo you know what the problem might be? I uninstalled (marking for complete configuration removal) and re-installed Skype, but it still remembers my username (why??).\nCan I find Skype configuration files on the filesystem somewhere and change permissions for them - or even better - edit the files to set what I want?\n\nA: Rename your ~/.Skype folder to something like ~/.Skype-old.\nNow sign in to Skype fresh, and it will reset itself. You can now copy the contents from the old folder that you want to preserve to your new ~/.Skype folder :).\nYou can also check the permissions of the files in that folder to ensure that Skype can read and write them correctly. If they seem correct and you still get problems, try running a disk check, which might fix any errors with the file-system (just in case)\n", "Q: How can I get a java apps to use the GTK+ theme?

It has two operating systems installed - Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition. \nIt has GRUB to manage which operating system to boot up. Windows is default OS. And Windows fails to boot up without video card. I'm checking with ping to the ports which are shown as used by DHCP in my router. \nNormal boot of Ubuntu also fails and it restarts after a while. But when I choose (blindly, but checking HDD indicator and by counting button presses when GRUB menu appears) to boot second option of Ubuntu (rescue mode) it starts and I can ping it.\nBut when I try to connect to it through SSH, I'm getting \"connection refused\" error from putty.\nI've took out HDD from my laptop already and inserted it to WD Passport case so now I can connect it to other computer to edit configuration files.\nHow can I check if SSH server is working?\nHow to enable it in rescue mode? Or better, how to disable video card to be required while booting Ubuntu in normal mode?\n\nA: I'm partially guessing here - this would be a comment if it hadn't been too long for the box - but you could try: \nStarting the ssh deamon in rescue mode. \nI don't expect this to work, as it may depend on other services that haven't been started yet (rescue mode is a very low-level state with a bare minimum of services running), but it's the quickest:\n# /etc/init.d/ssh start\nAs you are working blindly you won't see any error messages, but you can obviously tell that it's working when you can ssh into the box.\nDisable the desktop and X server \nSince rescue mode works, I'm guessing that the terminal doesn't require a working video card. In that case you should be able to disable anything related to graphics (desktop and X server), and the system might boot to a normal mode terminal-only state. SSH might already be running by then, or you can start it with sudo service ssh start.\nI don't have Ubuntu desktop so I can't give details on how to do that, but I believe X server and/or the desktop manager is started as a service. Have a look in /etc/init.d and /etc/init, and see the second reply to this question for how to disable it.\nI don't know if this will work, but it might be worth a try.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nHave you tried to reformat your HDD since neither of your OS's are working? At least this way you'll have an interface. \nIf you install in low graphics mode (or rescue mode) it will install perfectley fine. Thats how I did it with gOS. \nTo change the resolution to a setting your monitor supports, add \"screens and graphics\" to your preferences menu and in the monitor settings under generic (or custom ) set to desired resolution. Do not set it to your video card, it will load with distorted graphics or not at all. \nHope this helps, you can email me if you have any questions. I had the same excact problem, my Nvidia crapped out on me on my HP Pavillion laptop. I reformatted and installed gOS in rescue mode and its working beautifuly now.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Preferences does not show usage, name, e-mail, current plan Ubuntuone is correctly synchronizing selected files between two computers running Ubuntu 10.10.

Recently I decided to test natty, so i download it and try to install it on VirtualBox (v4.0 - 3D Acceleration Enabled) but have problem in using unity (It says to change my desktop to classic...)\nNow I want to install it on my PC, so I came here to ask is it safe to do that?\n\nA: Sure! \nIt's safe when you resize your partition to have about 20 to 30 GB unused space. \nThen you install from scratch using this unused space, leaving your system untouched. Just don't mess up your partition names during this process.\nIf done right you'll get a dual boot system that way!\nThere should be an option within the installer to resize your partition during the install process if you start the installer from the live cd. Be careful when the bootmanager (grub) gets it's entries, not to mess it up. But even this would be easy to fix afterwards. \nBUT: \nIf you are not familiar with the install process I STRONGLY advise to try the whole procedure of the parallel installation on your Virtualbox disk (the one you already have a natty system running on) BEFORE running on your productive system! \nAlso remeber: Natty is still alpha status, so I would suggest a test run on a virtualbox disk in any case!\nGood Luck, Have Fun!\ncya, piedro\n", "Q: Run 64bit OS in Virtual Box from 32bit Ubuntu Is it possible to run Windows 7 64 bit from a 32bit ubuntu OS? \nI can reinstall Ubuntu as a 64bit OS, but would prefer not to if it is not necessary.\n\nA: For Virtual Box, here's the Virtual Box FAQ:\n\nNote that VirtualBox also supports\n  64-bit guest operating systems, under\n  the following conditions: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You need a\n  64-bit processor with hardware\n  virtualization support (VT-x or AMD-V)\n  \n*Since version\n  2.1.0, you can run 64 bit Guests while running a 32 bit Host. \n  \n*You must enable hardware virtualization through your BIOS\n  \n\nSo it depends on your CPU. Just having a 64-bit processor isn't sufficient, the CPU also needs hardware virtualization support. \nAs an example, the Intel i3 540 is listed as having \"Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x): yes\", so it should work there.\n\nA: From VB help:\n\nVirtualBox supports 64-bit guest\n  operating systems, even on 32-bit host\n  operating systems, provided that the\n  following conditions are met:\n1.-You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see\n  Section 10.3, “Hardware vs. software\n  virtualization”).\n2.-You must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM\n  for which you want 64-bit support;\n  software virtualization is not\n  supported for 64-bit VMs.\n3.-If you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating\n  system, you must also select a 64-bit\n  operating system for the particular\n  VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit\n  hosts incurs additional overhead,\n  VirtualBox only enables this support\n  upon explicit request.\nOn 64-bit hosts (which typically come\n  with hardware virtualization support),\n  64-bit guest operating systems are\n  always supported regardless of\n  settings, so you can simply install a\n  64-bit operating system in the guest.\n\n\nA: If your BIOS and processor support it, then yes. I'd suggest using hardinfo to check your processor's features. However you are better off using the 64bit OS as host anyway.\nEven if you processor supports VTx your BIOS may not (many HP laptops for example do not allow you to turn this on), so you have to know if your BIOS also supports it.\n\nA: I found that on my Ubuntu Lucid (32bit install) machine that it will complain that hardware virtualization is not turned on when it really is. The reason it does this is because the kvm module is loaded. I blacklisted kvm and kvm_amd and now Virtualbox loads up 64 bit guests on a 32bit host just fine. \n", "Q: Man pages offline for e-reader? Is there anywhere one can get a copy of Ubuntu's man pages in e-reader (preferably Kindle/mobi, epub can be handled)format?\n\nA: This bash command will dump HTML files for every man page on the system.  You'll need to install the groff package first, then cd to an empty directory and run:\nfor f in `ls -1 /usr/share/man/man*`; do n=`echo $f | sed s/[.].*[.]gz//`; man -Thtml $n > $n.html ; done\n\nThis will cycle through all of the files in the /usr/share/man directory, strip off the section number and the extension using sed, then call man to render the manpage to HTML (man -Thtml in turn calls groff, which is why you need it installed first), storing the result in an html file with the same name as the page.  It will take a while to complete, and groff throws some warnings about line breaks, but when it finishes, you will have all of your man pages in HTML format.\nMost e-readers can handle HTML files, but if yours doesn't, you can use calibre to convert the HTML files to mobi or epub or any other format you choose.\n\nA: all man pages are located at\n/usr/share/man\n\nBut they're compressed in .gz files.\nAlso there's a web where you can see all man pages online.\nI guess if you search a software who gives you the possibility to download all content of each page/link, you can create your own man-pages library for e reader \n\nA: You can ask to man to convert a manpage into HTML and then running a command to display it. So you can import a man page directly into calibre with (If you obtain something like command exited with status 3, install groff package):\nman --html=calibre YOUR_MANPAGE\n\nYou can also import you manpage to calibre database without running GUI:\nman --html='calibredb add' YOUR_MANPAGE\n\nOnce your manpage is in calibre, you can easily send them to your e-reader (I suggest to send them as .mobi format).\nNow, just iterate over the list of manpage you want to import:\nfind /usr/share/man/man[1-9] -type f | xargs -l man --html='calibredb add'\n\n", "Q: How to configure FTP server? I am using Ubuntu 10.04 as ftp server, when I upload file using Filezilla client, I always got \"550 Permission denied\".\nHow to configure my server?\n\nA: Probably you has to set the folder's permission for that folder properly\nFor example:\nIf you want to upload a file to folder \"testing\" using user \"MyUser\" you have to set write and read permission to MyUser in Testing Folder.\n\nA: Don't Use ftp. It is an insecure protocol because it passes login information in the clear. \nYou should use sftp. Install the package openssh-server\nBy default this allows root logins, so if you are exposing this system to the internet I would suggest turning off; /etc/ssh/ssh_config PermitRootLogin no\nThere is a good guide in the Ubuntu documentation; https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html\nIf you can work through the process of using ssh keys to login then disable password authentication then this will greatly enhance the security of your system.\nFor accessing this from non Linux systems I would recommend either using putty, or winscp\n\nA: The ftp server's settins are likely to be stored in a text file in /etc/name-of-ftp-server/settings-or-similar.conf Open that file with root permissions and edit it, be careful or you'll break your ftp server from working correctly.\nThe second thing is to check the permissions for the incoming (ex. /var/www or /var/www/incoming if you want to limit upload right to your www server) and outcoming (/var/www )folders which a ftp client would use.\n\nA: You should specify which ftp server you are using.\nPersonally, I recommend ProFTPd. There is a tutorial online on how to set up the server. This server is simple  - therefore great for beginners.\n\nA: I would recommend vsftp. It's easier than proftpd. Installation guides are here http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-Vsftpd-in-Ubuntu-45753.shtml or here https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/ftp-server.html for example.\n", "Q: How can I make NetworkManager ignore my wireless card? I do not want NetworkManager to list or manipulate my wireless card.

Both are accepted together separated by semicolons, for example:\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2\n\nThis is an extract from NetworkManager.conf manual:\n\nunmanaged-devices\nSet devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager when using the keyfile plugin. Devices are specified in the following format:\nmac: or interface-name:. Here hwaddr is the MAC address of the device to be ignored, in hex-digits-and-colons notation.  ifname is the interface name of the ignored device.\nMultiple entries are separated with semicolons. No spaces are allowed in the value.\nExample:\nunmanaged-devices=interface-name:em4\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2\n\n\nA: Use the following /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nThis way your interfaces from /etc/network/interfaces will be unmanaged by Network Manager, i.e. it will not try to do anything with them.\n\nA: According to Gnome Wiki, the syntax in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (in older versions it was /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf) is different than what I'd read Arch Linux Wiki. It should be:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:19:e0:57:86:af\n\nThis configuration makes NetworkManager oblivious to the existence of my wireless card, but still allows me to control it using other methods.\n\nA: Alternate KEYFILE method\nRegardless of which linux distribution is running, an alternate method can be used to tell Network Manager to stop controlling an interface. This is done by adding the following lines to the Network Manager configuration file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:\n[main]\nplugins=keyfile\n\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:11:22:33:44:55;mac:66:77:88:99:00:aa\n\nList the MAC address of each interface you want Network Manager to ignore, separated with a semicolon. Make sure that MAC addresses listed here are LOWER CASE (If there already is a section [main] with plugins=..., add the plugin keyfile to that list there)\nTo get the mac address of your device wlan0 use\nLANG=c ifconfig wlan0|grep HWaddr\n\nThis will show the mac of the device, something like\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr ac:51:4f:70:13:72\n\nRestart NetworkManager with\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart\n\n\nA: I assume you're on Ubuntu Desktop; if that's the case, right-click on nm-applet (I think on Natty you just click) and uncheck 'Enable wireless'.  The only caveat is that you'll have to do that every time you log in.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, it is in the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. But you may need to deal with the permissions.\n\nA: Just create a .sh file containing killall -q wpa_supplicant and execute it using cron when you log in.\n", "Q: Nonresponsive UI starting a few days ago; no obvious resource shortage The mouse stops and moves jerkily, and sometimes won't register clicks.

One of the problems with recommending Ubuntu to potential future users, especially those not particularly given to technical endeavours, is that there is a chance that upgrades will break their machine, and they'll have to pay or otherwise coerce some knowledgeable person into fixing them.\nIn my limited experience of running successive versions of Ubuntu since 8-something on a couple of different laptops, this chance is quite high.  I'm not sure if I'm just unlucky with the hardware that I'm using, or if it's a result of the higher-than-average number of packages I have installed, or if upgrades are just typically problematic.\nSo I'd like to know the likelihood, for a casual user, of doing a release upgrade, for example from 10.04 to 10.10, without experiencing any regression bugs.\nObviously this is dependent on the hardware that people are running.  Canonical seems to be making some efforts towards collecting data on this, for example with the \"I am affected by this bug\" checkbox on their issue tracker, and with the laptop compatibility reports, but I've not seen anything comprehensive.\nI'm hoping for an objective reference here, for example a study carried out by relatively unbiased individuals.  However, anecdotal evidence is probably useful too.\n\nA: I'd love for someone to come up with some more numbers on this, here's my little analysis:\nThere are around 100 bugs tagged \"regression-release\", that are of \"High\" importance. A further three are marked \"critical\", two of those affect a bunch of specific ThinkPad models.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a look at the regression tracker, note only the ones that are tagged \"regression-release\". \nThere are quite a lot of them, of course, but then the average bug affects only a few users (now that's a number I'd like to know). Note that pretty much all of the 'serious' bugs have to do with some specific piece of hardware, and thus wouldn't affect \"well supported\" hardware platforms. \n\n*Take the time to sort this list by importance and read some of the descriptions. To me at least, many of them appear very minor, or affect only a small set of users. But I can't be the judge of that.\nThe likelihood of a normal user experiencing a release upgrade regression is almost impossible to estimate. The hardware platforms vary immensely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the affected packages, this will give you an indication as to the likelihood of a regression affecting your specific configuration. You'll notice many of them are filed against 'linux', and most of those are driver issues. \n\n\nIn my experience, everything works perfectly all the time. See how worthless that information is. ;-)\nI fear that's all I've got. It's really not a problem that is discussed much, which is why I have to doubt it exists at all. People usually only investigate such things in detail, create comprehensive statistical analysis, if many users are affected; due to the way Canonical and the community test before they release, this appears to be rare. \n\nA: We do see a lot of discussion on this topic everytime a new release has come out. Most experienced users prefer a fresh installation to an upgrade, and indeed there always are some proplems from incomplete updates or from regressions that may not have come up when you had done a new installation. Still, this recommendations are not based on solid statistical analyses that would be needed to really tell.\nStefano Palazzo has already pointed out why it is difficult, or maybe impossible to perform such an analysis. Too many individual factors had to be considered as no system is set up like the other. We can only have a look at what people post in the support forums to get a vague idea what problems may arise.\nNo problems on upgrade\nOn a not too much individually adapted system where software was only installed from Ubuntu repositories and no proprietary drivers are needed there are only very few (if any) reports on defects after an upgrade. This leads me to believe that an upgrade of such a system is nearly 100% safe. Personally I never had any problems when upgrading such a system.\nUpgrade fails\nWhen proprietary hardware drivers or packages from sources other than the Ubuntu repositories were installed still, in most cases even this is very cleanly handled by an upgrade. However sometimes then an upgrade may cause problems where additional configuration/repair may be needed. We also have to consider those cases where both, an upgrade failed, and a fresh install after that did not work either because of unsupported hardware.\nSubjective factors from supporters or experienced users come in because they are more likely to have highly adapted and individually configured systems therefore being much more affected by adverse effects from an upgrade. This explains why for them it may be less time consuming to simply perform a fresh install.\nWhat to recommend?\nUbuntu allows to keep most of your individual settings even if you performed a fresh install. Also the time needed for a fresh install is in the range of 20 min. as compared to up to 2 hrs for an upgrade. Therefore a fresh install seems very attractive indeed.\nThis is especially the case for basic installations with only few additional packages where we don't have to do not much additional work. But it is exactly these systems that also would upgrade smoothly.\nOn the other hand, if your system is very individually configured with many additional packages loaded then you would probably save much time when upgrading. If you are unlucky and the upgrade failed you still haven't lost the option to do a fresh install but you may loose a lot of the saved time to find out if your system can be repaired or not.\nFrom a practical view, recommend an upgrade when:\n\n*\n\n*Many additional packages are installed\n\n*Individual settings outside /home need to be kept\n\nRecommend a fresh installation when:\n\n*\n\n*Proprietary drivers not provided by the repositories are needed for a running system\n\n*The upgrade failed\n\nThis is entirely my personal view biased by my opinion that it does not really matter much what you do.\n\nA: It's an interesting question, but also very hard to answer, among other things since \"trouble free\" is a quite subjective metric. \nBut we can try to triangulate some numbers:\nThe likelihood of having an upgrade (any upgrade) work perfectly for everyone is zero. \nThis is independent of which operating system we are talking about, it is merely a function of the enormous number of combinations of people, skills, use cases, hardware and software that exists in the world.\nSee for example \n\n\n*\n\n*PC World article \"Fix the most common Windows 7 upgrade problems\"\n\n*Cross-reference with \"How we test software at Microsoft\"\nMicrosoft employs 9,000 testers who test daily builds across thousands of hardware and software combinations for years before a major relase; probably noone else in the industry puts as much resources into testing as Microsoft does.\nThat doesn't stop problem upgrade \"Windows 7\" from returning 300 million Google hits (the numbers vary, that's what I'm getting at my location at the moment).\nApple presumably has a simpler job because they tightly control the very small number of hardware combinations their OS is intended to run on. Still, problem upgrade \"OS X\" is worth 8 million Google hits.\nUbuntu (and Linux in general) faces the same problems as Microsoft by targeting close to every hardware combination under the Sun; but unlike Microsoft they are doing so with a fraction of the resources of the major players. problem upgrade Ubuntu gives 21 million hits, while problem upgrade Ubuntu 10.10 is ~3 million.\nThese are obviously highly unscientific, rough and ready numbers (your Google numbers will probably be different - it varies with location, the exact phrasing of the search, and quite possibly the phase of the moon...), but I think the relative frequency of complaints can still be a better indicator than random guessing.\nWe need to weigh complaint frequencies against usage frequencies, hard numbers are again hard to come by. \nBut a random source close at hand says that Win 7 is used by 24%, OS X by 8% and Linux by 1.5% of some unspecified population. (I have no idea what Ubuntu's market share is of the Linux total, but it's almost certainly less than 100% :)\nCombining these numbers with my own subjective experience and a vast quantity of anecdotes, hearsay and urban legends, I'm comfortable in believing that\n\n\n*\n\n*No existing software can guarantee a trouble-free upgrade for everyone.\n\n*Upgrade troubles are more frequent among Ubuntu users than among the users of the major commercial alternatives.\n\n*But not massively so.\n\n\nPersonally I always wait a few months after a release before I do an upgrade (whether it's Windows, Mac or Ubuntu) so the worst bugs can be ironed out, and I mostly have a reasonable trouble-free upgrade. And it seems to be getting better at every release, at least on the kind of hardware I am using.\n\nTo future users I would suggest that unlike romantic partners, nobody will really mind if you flirt with several operating systems at the same time. \nSo as long as you can spare some room on your primary drive, you can install Ubuntu as dual boot and try out an extramarital OS affair at very little risk.\n", "Q: Wired and Wireless Network Issues with PPPoE I have got this issue with Ubuntu 10.10. I have been with Ubuntu 8.04 and then decided to try out Ubuntu 10.10 . \nI booted with a LiveCD and was able to configure the wireless network painlessly using the livecd. So happily I installed Ubuntu 10.10. As soon as Ubuntu came up it detected the wireless network and I was able to assign a static IP to eth1 (i dont use DHCP option on my ADSL router) and enter a wap key and use pppoeconf to configure the dialer. The net was on and I was able to surf the net. All hunky dory so far.\nHowever on the next boot the fun started. It did not detect the wireless network. I could not see the network manager icon in the systray. I used ifconfig and saw that the entry for eth1 was missing. I used ifup eth1 and it said that eth1 was already up . \nThen I installed wifi-radar. Wifi-Radar detected the wireless network. I configured wifi-radar for the detected wireless network , set the wap driver as wext and used the manual IP settings. However on clicking connect wifi-radar started looking for a DHCP IP , needless to say it failed. For the love of god I cannot understand why wifi-radar is using DHCP when I have specified manual settings . \nNext I decided to use the wired network to surf the net looking for a solution . So I plugged in the network cable from my modem , it detected the plugged in connection , I configured eth0 , used pppoeconf and connected to the net. Then I foolishly decided to reboot my PC. And wonders of wonders , the same problem appeared. I cannot see eth0 in my ifconfig anymore. I used pon to start the dsl-provider connection and it said something about network error or something . Now my ifconfig shows only lo , both eth0 and eth1 have disappeared. Can anybody help me on this? \nIs it a problem with ipv6 , if so how do you disable ipv6 on Ubuntu 10.10 ? OR is this is a known issue with Ubuntu 10.10?\nP.S.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried Linux mint 10 and had the same issue. On rebooting wireless network was not getting detected .                 \n\n*I have made myself the administrator so that there is no issue of rights or anything.\n\n\nA: In order for Network Manager to manage your wireless connection, your wireless interface must NOT be listed in /etc/network/interfaces. But pppoeconf adds it. So what you need to do is remove it.\nEdit /etc/network/interfaces by opening a terminal and typing\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nand delete the following lines:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet manual\n\nRestart, and you should be good to go.\n\nA: I happens to me every time I configure pppoe after a fresh install. After the reboot the network connections becomes unmanageable. You need to do the following:\nopen terminal and type:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nyou will find your connection there and changed managed=false to managed=true and then restart you system. You will be able to get your network up and running again \n\nA: Make sure you've read the Ubuntu documentation on Wireless troubleshooting, which is available at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide/\nI've recently had a relative with a similar issue on his laptop. It turned out that the wireless card was disabled, and Fn + F12 had to be pressed to turn it on (it may differ on your computer, e.g. a switch in front of the laptop). The command rfkill list should show \"no\" twice on Soft/ Hard blocked for \"Wireless LAN\".\n\nA: According to the questioner, using wicd solved the problem.\nsudo apt-get install wicd\n\n", "Q: Error after sudo-ing \"sudo: must be setuid root\" On a colleagues computer, everytime I use a sudo command, I get this error:\nsudo: must be setuid root\nI tried various things mentioned on the internet, like changing the permissions to 4755 from a live cd, but even this command from a live-cd \nsudo chmod 4755 /media/device/usr/bin/sudo\ngives the same error.\nEDIT: The colleague told me that he executed this command, god knows why :/\nsudo chmod -R 777 / or sudo chmod -R 777 He isnt exactly sure.\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot the computer,choose recovery console and type the following commands\nchown root:root /usr/bin/sudo\nchmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\n\n*Reboot the machine.\n\n*Also have a look at this link for fixing broken sudo.\n\nA: After executing sudo chmod -R 777 / I'd recommend to urgently reinstall the whole system from scratch. The command opens too much security holes, as any and every file on the system became readable (and writable!) by any user - including /etc/shadow, /etc/hosts, and even /usr/bin/sudo and /bin/ls themselves! Your system may look like a colander - every minute of using it means catastrophic risk and losses, especially when connected to the Internet. And fixed permissions to just sudo won't do anything at all.\nConsider also this question.\n\nA: It is just as much heavier to restore all permissions to the file system to the out-of-the-box install state, that it is more secure and faster to reformat partitions and reinstall the system than trying to undo a\nsudo chmod -R 777 /\n\ncommand. A system with 777 (rwxrwxrwx) permissions is just hopelessly broken. Any malware that attacks a security hole allowing execution of arbitrary code via browser can modify root-owned scripts and executables, while setuid's like sudo won't work if they are checking executable's permissions ...\nIn other words, on a system with world-writable 777 permissions browser cache is treated the same way the kernel image is. Simply nonsense.\nIn fact, sudo is checking its own permissions and they should be 4755\n(rwsr-xr-x), but your friend had reset permissions to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), which prevents sudo from running as it runs some security checks prior to starting your designated command.\nBut, anyway, sudo is pointless as you have already given world-executable permissions to any program on the computer, including possible malware in browser cache!\nFormat and reinstall is the safest way as your entire drive should be quarantined.\n\nA: Once you fix the permissions on sudo, then use sudo along with the same method to recursively fix the permissions (same -R parameter used to screw up the whole system in the first place, only on both the chown AND chmod commands) on /etc, /boot, /sbin, /bin, /dev, /proc, /sys, and /usr. That should mitigate the security issues at least to the point where the system is usable.\nThen again, a full reinstall would be easier should an attacker obtain control of your system (which they will if you're connected to the Internet at all while these permissions are being fixed), since it would be very difficult to take that control back otherwise.\n", "Q: How to change the binding of Windows key which runs Unity's Dash?

Basically you:\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the directory ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/\n\n*Place your script (written in Bash, Perl or Python) there.\n\n*Mark the script as executable using Nautilus or from terminal with chmod +x script_name\n\n*Nautilus makes environmental variables available to your script: NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS, NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URIS, NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI, and NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY\nThere are sample scripts located at (Help Ubuntu - Nautilus Sample Scripts) for e-mailing files, mounting an ISO file, setting files to read only, editing file with gedit ROOT priviledges, opening terminal at current location, etc.\nLook through the scripts and take one as a template for encrypting files, uploading to the cloud, compressing to backup or whatever you need to do.\n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04\nAt the date Ubuntu 18.04 was released Nautilus-Actions was/is no longer available. It also seems to have been superseded by a new program, called Filemanager-Actions, which otherwise looks identical.\n\nTo install this program, see this solution.\n\nNautilus Actions\nWe may define our own right-click context menu items with nautilus-actions .\n\n*\n\n*Run the Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool either from the Dash, or from a terminal with\n nautilus-actions-config-tool\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Action tab give your action a sensible label, e.g. \"Open in Terminator\" and choose to display this in the selection or the context menu.\n\n\n*Next open the Command tab to enter the commands to run\n\n\n*\n\n*Give in the full path to your command (/usr/bin/command_to_run) and program options.\n\n\n*After logging out and in again the right click context menu below will be displayed:\n\n\n\nA: If you want to be able to do something at any time, do like ulidtko says and use ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts.\nIf you want to be able to customize when you see it, install the nautilus-actions package, then go to System->Preferences->Nautilus Actions Configuration.\n\nA: TL;DR\nThe best solution for app developers is to use python-nautilus.\nCreate your python script (following examples and bad documentation) and copy it to the correct folder:\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions && cp script.py ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions\n\nDetailed Explanation\nLet's say you want to create an application that the user installs with a script or a .deb file, with that in mind I'll be explaining why I think python-nautilus is a better solution compared with nautilus-actions and the nautilus scripts.\nNautilus Actions\nThis is the only solution to offer a GUI and therefore makes it easy to create complex behavior, for example decide what menu entries to show if the selected file's mime-type is text/plain.\nThe main problem with this solution is that it is not easy (if even possible) to import the entries to another computer without the Configuration Tool and the user importing it, let's just say it would not be possible to do with a script.\nNautilus Scripts\nThis is the more straight forward solution, pick up a script, place it in a folder and done. This would definitely allow a install script or a .deb file to create a new entry in the context menu. What are the problems? Where do I start...\n\n*\n\n*It always appears under a Scripts sub-menu.\n\n*It doesn't show if you have nothing selected.\n\n*It doesn't allow you to decide if you should show the entry or not.\n\n*Does not allow Tooltips or different Titles. (maybe I'm being picky)\n\nA good app doesn't use shortcuts like this, because it ruins the user experience.\npython-nautilus\nNot as easy to create as the previous solutions, but offers the best of both worlds. Scripting and customization.\nThis solution allows you to create a python script that receives the files selected in nautilus and let's you decide if you wish to show a entry or not and what to do with that entry. It also allows you to create sub-menus and or cool stuff.\nThe drawback is the big lack of documentation and developers that just want to add an entry may find themselves losing a couple of hours to create a working prototype (In my research I found a solution based on C that was way more complicated than this).\nI normally use Visual Studio Code, while on Windows it offers a context menu entry Open with Visual Studio Code, it's lacking the same functionality on Linux, with the Python solution it would be easy to solve the problem. I think may apps in Linux could benefit from having a nautilus integration.\nHope this explanation helped you decide what to choose.\n\nA: This answer is outdated: a recently updated answer is this one.\nApp developers wanting to add their app's actions — see this page below, here and here.\n\nContext menus of Nautilus used to be customizable by Nautilus extensions. Be warned that this link leads to archived doc; Gnome devs removed that documentation and no longer support that kind of customization. It may still work though.\nYou can also place plain shell scripts under the ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts (~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts in early releases) directory, and they will appear in file context menu under Scripts submenu.\n\nA: One can Use python-nautilus extension as an alternative to nautilus-actions.\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install python-nautilus\n\nA simple example:\nimport os\n\nfrom gi.repository import Nautilus, GObject\n\nclass ColumnExtension(GObject.GObject, Nautilus.MenuProvider):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n    def menu_activate_cb(self, menu, file):\n         os.system(\"write here your simple bash command & pid=$!\")\n\n    def get_background_items(self, window, file):\n        item = Nautilus.MenuItem(name='ExampleMenuProvider::Foo2', \n                                         label='Name of your item', \n                                         tip='',\n                                         icon='')\n        item.connect('activate', self.menu_activate_cb, file)\n        return item,\n\nCopy this python script under ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions and restart nautilus. When you right click on the desktop and select your item, your simple bash command will be executed :)\n", "Q: DockbarX inside AWN, preview window shifted on dual-screen after shifting from single-screen I've been running dockbarx in AWN for sometime now. I started using dual-screens and started seeing a problem with the window preview. When I hover over the dockbarx icon to see the preview it appears on the other monitor.\nI'm assuming that this is due to it still thinking there is only one monitor. I was hoping someone new of a gconf-editor setting that I could set with the rest of my screen that changes my laptop from internal monitor to my dual-screen setup.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Not a fix, I'm afraid - I have the same issue; and I've found that selecting a new theme and applying it sorts it too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click handle of dockbar\n\n*Select properties\n\n*Choose a new theme\n\n*Apply\n\n\nA: DockbarX has some bugs when it comes to dualscreen since I have no change to test the code myself and have to rely on bug reports from others. I've heard about this problem before (with dockbarx in normal panel, not awn) but I haven't found a solution.\n", "Q: Can I virtualize a pre-installed Windows 7? I am considering buying a new computer with Windows 7 (64-bit) pre-installed.  Would it be possible to install Ubuntu (preferably 64-bit) dual-boot on such a machine, and then, using VirtualBox / VMWare, etc. under Ubuntu, make a virtual machine that \"points to\" the existing Windows 7 OS (without making a copy of it)?\nJust to be clear... at the end of this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would have a machine that dual-booted both Windows 7 (64-bit) and Ubuntu (64-bit).\n\n*If I choose to boot Ubuntu, I would then have the possibility of running a visualization of Windows 7 within Ubuntu.\n\n*There would only be 1 copy of Windows 7 on the hard disk.\n\nA: There is a section in the VirtualBox User Manual explaining how to use a real disk or partition in a virtual machine. \nI tried once, and it works. The only problem I had was the video card driver: when switching from the real installation to the virtual one and back, I have to disable/enable the GuestAdditions video card driver, if i recall well (it was long time ago).\n\nA: I have setup KVM (the default virtualization software for ubuntu) to bring up a windows partition that I can alternately dual boot into.  \nSadly, its not an awesome solution, as there are a few gotchas.\n\n\n*\n\n*It wasn't trivial to setup, I had to manually modify some partition permissions and such (but there are some decent articles on this you can google for)\n\n*As it only works with disks and not partitions, I had to use my main disk virtually.  So when it started up, I got the multi-boot GRUB menu, as if I was starting up the machine.  If I were to select the same OS in the virtual instance that I was running in the physical instance, it could cause serious problems with two OSes trying to mount the same partition.\n\n*You need to have free space on your drive to do any of this (to even dual boot).  Usually pre-installed windows instances don't leave any space for a 2nd OS, so you'd have to re-size or something just to get dual booting.\n\n\nMoral of the story: its possible, but I haven't found an easy, error free way to get it working.\n\nA: I'd say no (better not very easily, following Mussnoon comments), as Virtual machines set up their own (virtualized) hardware, and your pre-installed Windows 7 will be configured to work with the real hardware. Things can get messed if you do that. Plus the activation problems mentioned in my comment, and maybe even licensing related issues.\n", "Q: Access Officejet Pro L7590 memory card reader I can't manage to access my printer's memory card reader in Nautilus.

So when I try to access it in my browser via machine-name/new-file.php I am told permission denied and I have to go and chmod the new file.\nI am wondering if there is a way I can default the www-data user/group to have access permissions to new files so I don't have to keep chmod every new file?\n\nA: You could use ACL. To set up ACL for Ubuntu 10.10, first mount the file systems with the acl option in /etc/fstab.\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx / ext4 defaults,acl 0 1\nsudo mount -o remount,acl /\n\nThen make a group to which a user may belong for this purpose.\nsudo groupadd developers\nsudo usermod -a -G developers $username\n\nThe user needs to log out and in again to become a member of the developers group.\nOf course, do not do this if you have content in the /var/www directory that you want,\nbut just to illustrate setting it up to start:\nsudo rm -rf /var/www\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/public\nsudo chown -R root.developers /var/www/public\nsudo chmod 0775 /var/www/public\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www/public\nsudo setfacl -d -m u::rwx,g::rwx,o::r-x /var/www/public\n\nThen replace references to \"/var/www\" with \"/var/www/public\" in a config file and reload.\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\nIf we wanted to restrict delete and rename from all but the user who created the file:\nsudo chmod +t /var/www/public\n\nThis way, if we want to create directories for frameworks that exist outside the\nApache document root or maybe create server-writable directories, it's still easy.\nApache-writable logs directory:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/logs\nsudo chgrp www-data /var/www/logs\nsudo chmod 0770 /var/www/logs\n\nApache-readable library directory:\nsudo mkdir /var/www/lib\nsudo chgrp www-data /var/www/lib\nsudo chmod 0750 /var/www/lib\n\n\nA: I'm sure you have sorted this out already, so this is for anybody with similar request\nrun the \"change ownership\" command on your webroot folder:\nsudo chown manny -R www\n\nThis will make you the owner replace \"manny\" with your username, enabling you to write/read within www folder \n\nA: If your webserver cannot even read the files, it's very likely that the permissions of new-file.php are something like 600 (read and write for owner). Search for an umask setting in your FTP application, and make sure it's something like 007.\nIf your web application needs to chmod the files (or other operations which can only be done by the file owner), you need an other approach. If you're using Apache, you should consider using the itk MPM. With that module, you can make Apache run/open the files using the same user as \"ftpuser\".

I have followed instructions in this forum post, intended to mount the drive through Terminal: http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/forum/t-90514/how-to-recover-data-from-wd-my-book-world-edition-nas-device#post-976452\nI have identified the partition that I want to mount and recover files from as /dev/sd4 by running \"fdisk -l\" and getting this:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0001cf00\n\nDevice Boot Start End Blocks Id System\n/dev/sdb1 5 248 1959930 fd Linux raid autodetect\n/dev/sdb2 249 280 257040 fd Linux raid autodetect\n/dev/sdb3 281 403 987997+ fd Linux raid autodetect\n/dev/sdb4 404 121601 973522935 fd Linux raid autodetect//\n\nWhen I try to mount using: \"mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb4 /media/xyz\" I get the following error:\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb4,\nmissing codepage or helper program, or other error\nIn some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\ndmesg | tail or so\n\nAnd \"dmesg | tail\" shows me:\n[ 15.184757] [drm] Initialized nouveau 0.0.16 20090420 for 0000:01:00.0 on minor 0\n[ 15.986859] [drm] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: Allocating FIFO number 1\n[ 15.988379] [drm] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: nouveau_channel_alloc: initialised FIFO 1\n[ 16.353379] EXT4-fs (sda5): re-mounted.

What do I need to do to mount this partition and copy its contents? Does it have anything to do with the drive being part of a RAID Array (see question mentioned above)?\nMany thanks to any who can help.\n\nA: Sounds like the file system got corrupted somehow.\nYou can try \"fsck -t ext3 /dev/sdb4\" and see if that fixes your issues.\nAlso, make certain that ext3 is the correct file system, if I understand right fsck can corrupt data if you give it the wrong file system.\n\nA: Indeed the issue has been resolved by an answer from @Oli to another similar question that I posted here: Not enough components to start the RAID array?\nThe HDD was set up as having 4 partitions of RAID-1. This is probably why it could not be mounted. Having installed mdadm and having used it to \"assemble\" the drive I was able to see mount it via Disk Utility. \nSee the answer to my other question above for full details.\n\nA: I recently had an issue with my Western Digital My Book World Edition White light 2TB NAS (only 1 HD). It was working perfectly for a very long time when I moved and thought hey, why don't I set my stuff up right and put a static IP on this thing so all my computers can map to it everytime instead of having to discover it each time and see what DHCP IP was given. So I did that, and it worked. Then while I was in the configuration of the NAS, I saw that a system update was available. Dumb a$$ me decided to go ahead and get the latest update as that is supposed to be a good thing right? It is all automated and you can't really do anything except click the button, but after it did it's thing, my NAS was a brick. The bottom white light would stay lit for an extremely long period of time and then fade out and back. No luck getting it on the LAN either. Resets, reboots, prayers, user manuals; didn't help. Some research later, turns out I am not the only idiot who messed with a good thing and paid the price. The drive was still spinning so I had the joy of getting it out of the case. I could probably put it back together if I wanted to, but after this little experience with EXT3 and XFS file systems, I think I will be better off just shoving it into a bay on my Windows 7 box and farming it out (NTFS) from there. Not like 2TB is all that impressive in NAS size anymore anyway. \nNow that story time is over, here is what I found when trying to get the files off via an External USB enclosure connected to my Windows 7 Desktop: the drive has four partitions. Two of them are EXT3 and with a little messing around and a good application (EXT2FSD), I was able to read the two EXT3 file systems in Windows natively. I found the folders where my files should be but to my dismay, nothing is in them. Turns out, the fourth partition is where the good stuff is and it is setup as an XFS file system. It showed up as Raw though. \nThis is not easy to see in Windows. Raise Data Recovery offers paid software that can save your bacon or at least give you a glimmer of hope as you can try it free and at least see that your files are actually still there. Mine were not deleted or anything so my file structure is perfect. If you are looking for deleted files, it will do it as long as they have not been written over, but the menu tree may be a bit cryptic to go through. My files are still there and waiting for me in perfect form, but I am going to take my drive to a friends house who loves linux and see if Mint (it says it can see XFS) can see the data without forking over around 28 USD for the Raise software. Especially in my case where I am not trying to recover deleted files. I just need to read the damn partition cause my NAS went t!ts up during a firmware update (thanks again Western Digital). At least I still have a working 2TB Western Digital Green drive to shove in my computer when I get done pulling my files off and reformatting.\nHope this is not too late for you.\n", "Q: Hotkey to shut down from login screen? I used to run 9.04 on my server and used to be able to use Alt-T, Alt-S to shut the system down from the login screen. It was using a KDE login screen. Now I've upgraded to 10.04 and use the Gnome login screen and I can't see any keyboard shortcuts to shutdown the server. Is there a shortcut and if so, what is it? \nFurther info - I would normally shut down the server without turning on the monitor, which was easy using the keyboard shortcuts. Doing it with a mouse is not so easy without the monitor being on.\n\nA: It appears to be a missing feature. :-(\nThere is a bug filed for this issue: #505323, GDM's settings bar inaccessible with keyboard\nSee How do I subscribe to a bug for instruction on how to follow the progress of this bug. If you are already logged in to launchpad and ready to go, click \"This bug affects me\".\nIf you really need it, you can use a different display manager, kdm for the moment. Note that it has a big bundle of dependencies. You can also go ahead and ask a question here on how to set a keyboard shortcut that doesn't depend on gnome running. \nThere is a keyboard shortcut to shut down your system that is available all of the time, but it's rather tedious and complicated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+SysRq+(R, E, I, S, U, O).\nThat is, hold down alt and sysrq, then type REISUO, or REISUB to reboot. The SysRq key is the Print Screen key on most keyboards (on some laptops, it's Fn +Print, or Alt+Fn+Print)\nIt's not a completely clean shutdown either (although it's good enough). I'm sorry to say I think that's as good as it gets at the moment.\n", "Q: Laptop resumes from suspend while lid is closed I have a Dell Studio 15 and I am running Ubuntu 10.10.\nWhen I close my lid or select the suspend option, the machine suspends as indicated by the slowly pulsing power indicator.\nI'll put the machine in my bag and after a while it seems that the machine resumes, at least I think. When ever I go to get it, it's overheated and the system cannot resume. I am guessing that the processor resets in this overheat condition, but heat is still generated. This has happened about three times and I'm getting worried that I'll end up damaging the machine.\nHow can I diagnose why the system is resuming from suspend? Can I force it to never resume from suspend if the lid is down?\n\nA: Removing the lid's ability to resume from a suspended state might be helpful as a temporary hack (though is admittedly, not a solution). \n", "Q: Ubuntu/Windows XP - Joint systems \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to I remove windows but keep Ubuntu? \n\nI have a computer sectioned to run both Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows XP but as XP refuses to log in (If I select XP the log in starts with the Windows logo being shown on the screen for a few seconds before the screen goes blank and the page showing the option of selecting Windows or Ubuntu the re-appears), I would like to clear it completely from the system and just run Ubuntu.\nCan this be done, and if so, how do I proceed with doing it?\n\nA: Just login into ubuntu and run a tool like gparted where you can delete Windows's partition.\nAfter that you've to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and delete windows's entry\nJust like [this tutoria][1] say \n[1]: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToRemoveWindows#Further Operations\n", "Q: Is there a way to create a hidden account? For privacy reasons I want to create an account that is invisible to other users (even another administrator) and can be only reached by directly typing the user name in. Is that possible?\n\nA: Since any user needs to have a password entry in /etc/passwd the answer is No. Anyone with root access can see the contents of the file and therefore know about your user.\nEven if you use directory services such as ldap, the user has to be registered somewhere.\nWhen it comes to hiding from other desktop users, you can do some things to make it harder. Disabling the user list in gdm is one of them. You also probably want to put the home directory somewhere other than /home. But someone with a bit of knowledge might still be able to find out.\n\nA: You can have shell users without a home directory:\nuseradd --no-create-home new_username\n\nBut this probably won't cut it if you need to be able to log in with this user. As Carsten says, there's always going to be a trail back to the user at some point because the system needs to authenticate them.\nIf you're just trying to hide somebody from the login screen, that's fairly easy.\n\nA: The GUI tools ignore accounts with uid < 1000, which are reserved for system accounts.  Give the account an unused uid in that range and it won't show up in the gui tools.  Short of patching in a backdoor into the login program though, you can't hide it from the command line tools or direct inspection of /etc/passwd.\n\nA: A perhaps tangential but super-paranoid way to have a hidden user would be to have an encrypted partition (possibly on a USB stick or other portable device) with some combination of -- hidden files (a given), hidden scripts (to proxy or hide local and or internet data use), hidden OS/VM.  Note that if you're interested in covering your tracks, your might need to obfuscate your local file usage, memory data, and tcp/ip activity.\nencrypt-fs is included in recent Ubuntu releases.  Another option is something like   Truecrypt (which I have used but am not currently using) that allows you to do crazy things like \"[provide] plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: [via] Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.\"\n", "Q: Connectify-like functionality on Intel 4965 AGN wireless? I would like to use my laptop as an Access point, so that i can connect my phones through Wifi. I have done this my office laptop T410. I am having T61 with wifi module 4965. Connectify on windows does not support it. I am following these instructions \nto make achieve WAP capability on my T61 running ubuntu 10.10. \nThe link says something about \"master mode\", how do i put my T61 wifi-inter4965 in master mode. Can I install madwifi or atheros drivers on it? I am using galaxy S froyo, and it does not support Ad-hoc network. Has anyone tried to achieve this?\n\nA: It appears that the current driver for the Intel 4965 Wireless card does not support Master (AP) mode,\nhttp://bugzilla.intellinuxwireless.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1585\nHowever, it appears there is work on this. It is an issue of the Linux kernel (where the driver is now developed) to get support for AP Mode. \nAs a workaround for now you could get an inexpensive USB Wireless dongle that does support AP Mode. They cost between $10-$20.\n", "Q: Laptop suspend appears broken, what must I roll back? Question:  What package contains the subprogram responsible for the KMenu option \"sleep\"?\nBackground: I've been running KUbuntu 10.04.1 and I am completely updated.  Recently (within the past month), the \"sleep\" menu item has stopped working.  It just sits there waiting like I clicked nothing. I've check all of the logs in /var/log and nothing is added when I click sleep.\nI'm guessing that something I updated has bollux'ed things up, but I don't know which package contains the component that I need to roll back.  In the meantime, I've installed uswsusp, but s2ram & s2both don't ask my password when the laptop resumes -- which really bothers me.  So now that I've got a little time to track this down, I had to post -- any ideas??\nUpdate: I've messed around with the versions of acpi for quite some time.  It appears to be working.  If I run sudo /etc/acpi/sleep.sh it works and the computer suspends.  As above, it does not lock the screen first, but at least the damn thing suspends.  Oddly, sudo /etc/acpi/sleepbtn.sh does not work.\n\nA: I do not know yet how to solve this problem; however, to manually suspend and lock the screen in KUbuntu (and perhaps Ubuntu?) I've aliased a command which I'm sure others can use -- so I want to post it here.  I'm also going to reclaim the bounty and keep offering it until someone answers...\nIf you do:\nsudo qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock; sudo pm-suspend\n\nThis will first lock the screen and then issue a suspend command.  Although sudo isn't needed for the first command, you'll want to enter the password before the screen locks because you'll have to unlock it to gain sudo ability to suspend if you don't.\n", "Q: How to enable SSH server in recovery mode?

No doubt! :-)\nHowever I thought of a command line solution to execute an aliased command in sudo where there is no need to redefine sudo with an alias command.\nHere is my proposal for those to whom it may interest:\nSolution\ntype -a <YOUR COMMAND HERE> | grep -o -P \"(?<=\\`).*(?=')\" | xargs sudo\n\nExample\nIn the case of the ll command\ntype -a ll | grep -o -P \"(?<=\\`).*(?=')\" | xargs sudo\n\nExplanation\nwhen you have an alias (such as: ll) the command type -a returns the aliased expression:\n$type -a ll\nll is aliased to `ls -l'\n\nwith grep you select the text between the accent ` and apostrophe ' in that case ls -l\nAnd xargs executes the selected text ls -l as parameter of sudo.\nYes,  a bit longer but completely clean ;-) No need to redefine sudo as alias.\n\nA: Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc:\nalias sudo='sudo '\n\nFrom the bash manual:\n\nAliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and unalias builtin commands.\nThe first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The characters ‘/’, ‘$’, ‘`’, ‘=’ and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias ls to \"ls -F\", for instance, and Bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a space or tab character, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.  \n\n(Emphasis mine).\nBash only checks the first word of a command for an alias, any words after that are not checked. That means in a command like sudo ll, only the first word (sudo) is checked by bash for an alias, ll is ignored. We can tell bash to check the next word after the alias (i.e sudo) by adding a space to the end of the alias value.\n\nA: I have another nice solution, that adds a bit of trust too:\nUse bash completion to automatically replace words behind sudo with their aliases when pressing tab.\nSave this as /etc/bash_completion.d/sudo-alias.bashcomp, and it should automatically be loaded at interactive shell startup:\n_comp_sudo_alias() { from=\"$2\"; COMPREPLY=()\n  if [[ $COMP_CWORD == 1 ]]; then\n    COMPREPLY=( \"$( alias -p | grep \"^ *alias $from=\" | sed -r \"s/^ *alias [^=]+='(.*)'$/\\1/\" )\" )\n    return 0\n  fi\n  return 1\n}\ncomplete -o bashdefault -o default -F _comp_sudo_alias sudo\n\nThen log in to a new terminal, and you should be good to go.\n\nA: @WinEunuuchs2Unix: $PWD expands to the \"present working directory\". I think you want $HOME.\nAlso, for most situations, it's probably best to have a separate root .bashrc file. In fact, I'd make it a real file in /root, soft link to it in the user's home directory (e.g., .bashrc_root), and source it from the user's .bashrc file. If at some later time this privileged user account is no longer present, the root .bashrc file is still available for other users.\n\nA: If you type sudo -i and elevate to a sudo prompt (#) you won't have the aliases or functions you like to use.\nTo utilize your aliases and functions at the # prompt, use:\nsudo cp \"$HOME\"/.bashrc /root/.bashrc\n\nWhere \"$HOME\" is expanded into \"/home/YOUR_USER_NAME\"\n\nA: I have a different solution whereby you do not need to add sudo as an alias. I run Linux Mint 17.3 but it should be pretty similar to Ubuntu.\nWhen you are root, then the .profile is run from its home directory. If you do not know what the home directory under root is, then you can check with:\nsudo su\necho $HOME\n\nAs you can see, the home of root is /root/. Check its contents:\ncd $HOME\nls -al\n\nThere should be a .profile file. Open the file and add the following lines:\nif [ \"$BASH\" ]; then\n    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases];then\n        . ~/.bash_aliases \n    fi\nfi\n\nBasically, what this bash script does is to check for a file called .bash_aliases. If the files is present, it executes the file.\nSave the .profile file and create your aliases in .bash_aliases. If you already have the aliases file ready, then copy the file to this location\nRe-launch the terminal and you are good to go!\n", "Q: /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp has failed with an HP LaserJet p3005 Ever since 10.04, I can't print to an HP Laserjet P3005.

To solve the problem, I opened a terminal and entered the command:\ncupsenable \"queue-without-quotes\"\n\nBackground information which lead me to cupsenable:\nfrom http://www.openprinting.org/download/files/beh\n# Usually, if a CUPS backend exits with an error status other than zero\n# (for example if a printer is not turned on or not reachable on the\n# network), CUPS disables the print queue and one can only print again\n# if a system administrator re-enables the queue manually. Even restarting\n# CUPS (or rebooting) does not re-enable disabled queues.\n\n\nA: Try going to system, then printing, then right click the printer, choose properties, then click on policies on the left, then make sure the \"Enabled\" was checked. It worked for my HP laserjet 1320.\n\nA: check permissions for /usr/lib/cups/backend. seems like a fuzzy update broke them. assure that backend and executables within have a 755 permission.\n\nA: Try re installing or re-downloading the package or application.\n\nA: I have had problems with a HP LaserJet cp3505 and pdfs as well. Although in my case I was sharing the printer with CUPS on a Ubuntu 12.04 server and having problems on a Windows machine when printing pdfs. Using a generic postscript print driver for Windows machine solved my problems.     \nIf you are connecting directly to the printer, then maybe you could try installing a more generic print driver? One that is not specific to your model such as HP LaserJet Series PCL 6 CUPS (en).\nIf you are connecting to cups shared printer, then try the generic (or HP) postscript driver. Well that is something to try at least. Good luck.\n\nA: My problem may be related An HP P1102-w.\nFails with this \"Idle - /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp failed\"on every bootup.\nSolution; Delete the printer; reinstall the printer and start,stop, start again with the power switch. Works every time for me.\nSimplist of all is to delete the printer before shutting down Then power the printer on/off/on again when you want to use it. Install proceeds faultlessly and remains so until the next boot of the OS when you have to play the delete reinstal game again.\nThis is from personal experience.\n", "Q: How to control fan speed in Dell Inspiron 5010 (15R)? How can I control fan speed on Inspiron 15R? I installed i8kutils as instructed on ubuntuforums but don't know how to use it. Fan makes quite a noise and runs all the time. \n\nA: So doing the research on this, it looks like the way to control the fan is to issue the following command:\ni8kctl fan R L\n\nWhere R is the right fan mode and L is the left fan mode. The modes are as follows:\n0  turn the fan off\n1  set low speed\n2  set high speed\n-  don't change the state of this fan\n\nYou should install sensors-applet which contains an applet you can add to your gnome panel. This keeps track of the temperature of your cpu and system and you should certainly keep a track on it if you are going to change the fan speed. Once you've got the applet installed, you just have to right click on your gnome panel and click Add to panel... look down the list for Hardware Sensors Applet\n", "Q: How can I suspend using a keyboard shortcut, without administrator privileges? How can I set up a keyboard shortcut that I can use instead of clicking this menu item?\n\nI have read about various terminal commands for suspending which I could easily assign to a keyboard shortcut, but all have required the use of sudo. I am looking for a solution that I can use on a system where I do not have administer privileges.\n\nA: Same as above, but use this command instead:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend\" boolean:true\n\nSource: http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=16497311#p16497311\n\nA: For Ubuntu 15.04. and later you can use from the terminal\nsystemctl suspend\n\nThen create a shortcut in the settings/keyboard app with the same command.\n\nEasy!\nReason: Ubuntu switched from upstart to systemd.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the powermanagement-interface  package first, it provides the pmi command we will use to suspend.\nUPDATE: I looked at the source for pmi and the command it uses to suspend is:  \ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nIf you can't install pmi, replace pmi action suspend with that command in the next step. \n\n*Open up System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts, click on Add and put pmi action suspend as the command.  \n\n\n*Click on the newly created shortcut entry, and set the shortcut keys.\n\n\nA: With Ubuntu 16.04 LTS an newer I would suggest using systemctl instead because newer systems use systemd to control things.\nThe safe command to run is systemctl suspend which suspends the machine immediately unless some process is asking the system to stay powered (e.g. video player showing a movie, active CD burner, another logged in user doing anything, etc).\nIf you want to force suspend immediately and ignore all \"inhibitors\" simply add -i as explained by the output of the above command.\nIf you want to immediately lock the screensaver and suspend the system in all cases, you can run\nloginctl lock-session && systemctl suspend -i\n\nThis is better than using raw dbus to send messages because using loginctl and systemctl avoids hardcoding any info about your screensaver or session manager.\n\nA: systemctl suspend -i worked for me.\nMapped to super+d in the Keyboard settings custom shortcuts.\n", "Q: How can I use Unity 2d with another window manager besides Metacity?

Made a sad discovery today. I have Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. My client is in the ad business and she had a marketing competition task for me. She wanted me to visit websites of the competitors, and export the home pages as PDF. However, she wanted me to do so with embedded hyperlinks.\nAs it turns out, Firefox (and even the latest Chrome) on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS do not embed hyperlinks in PDF web page exports.\nSure, there are several Chrome and FF plugins that let you export as PDF, but what these do is connect to the URL remotely, generate the PDF remotely, and then force a download in your browser to download it from a remote location. That's not good for me, though, because some of these competitor pages require an initial login. That means that all I get back on the PDF printing from these FF or Chrome plugins is a login page.\nIs there a way to get around this problem, to fix the broken PDF printer on Ubuntu 10.04?\n\nA: The tool to use is called wkhtmltopdf, this tool is in the repositories but all compiled repository versions don't have the embeded link functionality due to the hackish changes to some qt libraries.\nSo install wkhtmltopdf from the repositories to get all the dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf\n\nThen download the static version from here. Unpack the file to your desktop and then move to bin:\nsudo mv Desktop/wkhtmltopdf-i386 /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf-static\n\nNow you can use the tool to generate pdf files with links:\nwkhtmltopdf-static http://google.com google.pdf\n\nFor your websites with the login requirement, you need to log in via firefox and then export the cookie file using the Export Cookies firefox plugin. With a cookies.txt you can then run:\nwkhtmltopdf-static --cookie-jar cookies.txt http://google.com google.pdf\n\nI know a lot of these needs to be done on the command line, but it's the best way to do it and you get a lot more control. wkhtmltopdf is quite a powerful tool.\n", "Q: TortoiseSVN (Subversion Client)?

Under Ubuntu I observe the same issue, but occasionally, usually it works and sometimes it can't find the network.\nDo you people think it's Ubuntu related, or is my network card broken?\n\nA: From your description I can only point to two possible failures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your network card is failing, as you guessed this is a hardware failure.\n\n*The cable is broken and you should try another cable.\n\n\nInstalling Ubuntu couldn't really have caused the issue, but sometimes these things coincide. Check your dmesg logs for clues, but I'm sure that you will need to replace the ethernet if it's a desktop and get a usb-ethernet dongle if it's a laptop.\n\nA: Are you using DHCP? If not, ensure you are not using an IP address that is already assigned to another box.\n\nA: Problem solved by re-establishing Windows contact with ethernet using an old PC.

I can continue playing a video after I Shift-Delete it. \nThere may be some special way to manually intervene and prevent this (by changing permissions),  but in my experience ,having only recently moved to Ubuntu,  I initially found this behaviour quite alarming (because it was so different to what I was used to)... \nI now like this feature...it has some nice advantages once you know that it behaves like this...  \nUPDATE: An example of what you want is possible easily seen (and done) in the /tmp folder...  You set read and write permissions to a group, so all members of that group can read and write... However, because the /tmp folder is owned by root (just another user)... and this other user has set the permission of the /tmp folder to 'sticky', only you (the owner) can delete files in /tmp  \nHere is a step by step example.. \n# To give a select group of users read/write/create access\n#   to a specific directory (and its sub-directories)\n# Fil deletion is only possible by the directory's owner, or by root.\n# Members of the group can create sub-directories.\n\n# create a primary user who will own the directory.\n  sudo adduser pri_user\n\n# create a group; for the exclusive use of this directory (+owner +root)\n  sudo groupadd pri_group\n\n# make the primary directory\n  sudo mkdir /pri_dir\n\n# set pri_dir's owner and group\n  sudo chown pri_user:pri_group /pri_dir\n\n# set pri_dir's permissions; the '1' is for the sticky bit.\n  sudo chmod 1770 /pri_dir \n\n# create users \n  sudo adduser nodel1\n  sudo adduser nodel2\n\n# Add users to pri_group\n  sudo usermod -aG pri_group nodel1\n  sudo usermod -aG pri_group nodel2\n\n# Note.

I have an Acer Aspire that I have dual booting XP and Ubuntu. \nOn the Windows side, the driver allows you to set how close your finger has to be to the edge of the TouchPad before it goes into scroll mode. In Ubuntu I don't have the option (at least in the GUI) to change the scroll area on the pad. \nIs there a conf file or other way to change this?

I see the usage of \"MiB\" as measure to represent the size in Ubuntu. What does MiB stand for? In particular the \"i\"?\n\nA: They are binary prefixes, corresponding to the more common decimal prefixes. (That's a good article which explains the rationale well.)\n\nA: There are two ways (in common use) of denoting orders of magnitude to make large numbers easier to read, first you can use a power of 10.\n10⁰ = 1\n10¹ = 10\n10² = 100\n10³ = 1000\n\nOr powers of two\n2⁰ = 1\n2¹ = 2\n2² = 4\n2³ = 8\n\nUsing these series as a base we arrive at the numbers 1000 and 1024 (10³ and 2¹⁰) for a kilo.\nThere are eight bits to a byte. So one kilobyte is 8×10³ = 8000 bits. Hard drive manufacturers use this method. In computer science, people usually use powers of two, so one kibibyte is 8×2¹⁰ = 8192 bits.\nThe difference only gets larger as the numbers get larger. Some have even mixed those two systems to get nice numbers to put on their packaging. This is why a 1.44MB floppy disk has neither 1.44 megabytes nor 1.44 mebibytes (they use 1024×1000).\nThe logic behind the i is that the terms are derived from the original si prefixes, kilo, mega, giga, but with the word binary put in in. So the i is the second letter of binary. The mnemonic for the kibibyte is \"kilo binary byte\", and \"KiB\" is pronounced \"Kibibyte\".\nAll of this is defined in the IEC_80000 Standard.\nNote that a mebibyte is not defined as 2²⁰, but as (210)2, although they are equal. A gibibyte is (210)3, a tebibyte is (210)4 and so on.\nPrefix       Bytes                      Prefix       Bytes\n1 Byte     = (2^10)^0 = 1               1 Byte     = (10^3)^0 = 1\n1 Kibibyte = (2^10)^1 = 1024            1 Kilobyte = (10^3)^1 = 1000\n1 Mebibyte = (2^10)^2 = 1048576         1 Megabyte = (10^3)^2 = 1000000\n1 Gibibyte = (2^10)^3 = 1073741824      1 Gigabyte = (10^3)^3 = 1000000000\n1 Tebibyte = (2^10)^4 = 1099511627776   1 Terabyte = (10^3)^4 = 1000000000000\n\nKeep in mind that, very often, the term kilobyte is used when the author means kibibyte. The binary unit was only introduced around 1999, as Randy Orrison points out.\n\nAs nealmcb found out in the comments, there is an official policy on this:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy\nIn summary, this policy reminds developers to either use SI or IEC prefixes, but to never mix them. It goes on to say:\n\nFor file sizes there are two possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*Show both, base-10 and base-2 (in this order). An example is the Linux kernel: \"2930277168 512-byte hardware sectors: (1.50 TB/1.36 TiB)\"\n\n*Only show base-10, or give the user the opportunity to decide between base-10 and base-2 (the default must be base-10).\n\n\n\nA: \nWhat does MiB stand for? In particular the \"i\"?\n\nSince no one actually answered this: \"MiB\" stands for \"megabinary byte\", which can be abbreviated to \"mebibyte\" (though this sounds kind of stupid, and I'd rather just stick with saying \"megabinary\").

disk. Check your computer's internal connections.\nIf it's not that, then you have serious issues which need to be reported as bugs (but check cables first). There is no answer really to such issues as if it is a bug, it just needs to be fixed by someone. See here for details:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\n\nA: This looks to be a harddrive error(because of ATA errors).  What worked for me when I had an error like this is loading to a bootable cd and runing \nfsck /dev/sda1\n\nThis fix the filesystem problem which was preventing my friends system from booting. \nI would also run smart test on the drive to see if it needs replacing.\n", "Q: Driver for a ATI Radeon xpress 200m graphics card? I am using ubuntu 10.10. where could i find my graphics card driver for my graphics card ati radeon xpress 200m. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There is an article in Ubuntu documentation web page about open source Radeon driver:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\n\nA: By default you should be using the standard radeon driver. If that isn't good enough, try the bleeding edge Xorg from the xorg crack pusher team. Performance with my Radeon x300 shot way up. The compiz window switcher now produces a 3d holograms as the screen flips around workspaces, and with a python module it can enlarge my screenspace without changing the resolution or dpi.\nBear in mind the stern warnings:\n\nPackages for those who think\n  development versions, experimental and\n  unstable are for old ladies. We want\n  our crack straight from upstream git!\n  Well, straight, we want it built and\n  packaged so we don't need to know what\n  we're doing, except that we will break\n  our X and put our computers on fire.\n\nAlso, Xorg windows start shaking if I haven't run apt-get upgrade recently.\nMay need to add yourself to the video group.\n\nA: No way for proprietary drivers (those downloaded directly from AMD), since AMD does not provide support for that graphic card. Open source ones shold be already up and running in your system (dmesg | grep -i radeon should provide you with some lines proving that the open source RADEON drivers are working)\n", "Q: Will the recent Intel graphics update be available for Maverick and when? with regards to the recent quarterly updates xorg/mesa/libva etc. Are they coming to maverick and when is this likely to happen.\n\nA: Your best bet will be to try the Xorg Edgers PPA.  This is usually very cutting edge material that will get you the latest and greatest graphics drivers.  Breakage may result when using this PPA, so probably not recommended for beginners or critical/production systems.\nTo add the PPA, run \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd cross your fingers...\n\nA: It's unlikely that these updates will come through the normal channels, as they could break the system along the way. Chances are however they will be available for installation at your own risk!!! through ppas.\n\nA: If the update is minor (eg o.5.1 -> 0.5.2), it may come through SRU (Stable Release Update).

Since I can't seem to open the Additional Drivers program? And how do I know what driver I need to install?\n\nA: For 12.04 and below\nThe internal name of the \"additional drivers\" program is jockey-gtk. There's a console version with the same functionality called jockey-text in the eponymous package. It should be installed by default.\nYou should be able to use\njockey-text -l\n\nto list the available drivers and something like\njockey-text -e xorg:nvidia-185\n\nto install one of the options listed. You should select the most appropriate driver listed.\n\nA: If you have a Nvidia graphics card:\nYou need to run\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nThen reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\nand you should have a working system.\n\nA: For 12.04 and below\nThe additional drivers program has a command line interface, jockey-text:\nUse \njockey-text --list\n\nto get a list of available drivers and their status, then use \n# the init lines are required only for graphics drivers\nsudo init 1\njockey-text --enable=DRIVER\nsudo init 2\n\nwhere DRIVER is the one you got from the list. For example:\njockey-text --enable=firmware:b43\n\nTo install the Broadcom B43 wireless driver.\nFor your graphics card, you will get a choice of the proprietary driver from the manufacturer and a free alternative. You have to either restart the display server (log out and back in) or restart the system entirely (recommended).\n\nA: After install nvidia driver you can regenerate xorg config for your nvidia adapter:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nAlso, you can download the driver from www.nvidia.com and install it manually:\nsudo sh ./downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-xxx.xx.xx.run\n\n\nA: For 14.04 and above\nsudo ubuntu-drivers list\n\nWill show all the driver packages which apply to your current system. You can then\nsudo ubuntu-drivers install      # on modern Ubuntu, or\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall  # on older versions.\n\nto install all the packages you need, or you can do:\nsudo ubuntu-drivers devices\n\nto show you which devices need drivers, and their corresponding package names.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One notifications?

If so, what is it?\nIn other words:\nHow can I do lock-session with tmux?\n\nA: I have the following tmux.conf lines:\n# Enable locking\nset -g lock-command vlock\nset -g lock-after-time 0 # Seconds; 0 = never\nbind L lock-session\n\nPressing [prefix] + L (capital) locks my session.\nRelated How can I lock just the current client?\n\nA: Put the following in the .tmux.conf:\nset-option -g lock-command vlock\n\n", "Q: System has gotten very slow of late. How to unearth the problem? I have been running processor and memory intensive tasks past 2 weeks. But, even after i stop the run, the system is pathetically slow.

I have scp'ed about 60L files from my server ( which is in the next room ) to the local system and it has been running since yesterday morning(30 hours and counting) . How to diagnose what is taking up so much of the available resources that Linux feels worse than Vista ? For now, i cannot restart the system as the scp operation is still running :( I checked System Monitor and it shows CPU1 and CPU2 usage between 20-40% [it keeps fluctuating].\nConfiguration : 64-bit AMD processor, 2 GB Ram. \nI ran top  to see the swap availability and this is what i saw > Total Swap : 4095992k . Used -> 198872k . Free : 3897120k \nRAM availability : \n1931136k total, 1493656k used, 437480k free, 753584k buffers\n. What could be , then, the reason for the pathetic performance ? \nThanks. \n\nA: There are three main issues which cause performance degridation, you can check for issues with these bottlenecks using the top command:\nProcessing (CPU)\nWhen your CPU has way too much to process, it tries to prioritise what items should be processed first and how busy the system should be allowed to get. This is complicated by multi-processor and scaling processor technologies but it's basically an easy thing to check.\nAs the processor gets busier the system will slow down in response.\nIO (Input/Output) aka Disk Activity\nThis is a key issue for modern machines with plenty of RAM and strong processors. The fact is, there is only so much bandwidth on the PCI bus and in-between all the parts of the computer. Copying files from the hard drive to the network causes slowdown in disk access and device access.\nAccessing files creates file caches in memory and uses processing power to generate protocols needed to shuffle the data to a different place.\nMemory (RAM)\nIf your computer ran out of memory, your programs would simply halt and/or crash. Instead the system starts putting lots of application data onto the swap partition. If you have a very intensive process that uses all of your ram, then you will find the entire of gnome and the ubuntu desktop will be saved to disk in the swap while the process completes.\nTrying to load another process will take time as the data has to be recovered from the swap area which is orders of magnitudes slower than ram. Even when your process has finished, there will still be large chunks of important system data in swap which will degrade performance when it's pulled back for use.\nObviously communicating with the disk causes i/o overhead and swapping is to be avoided if at all possible. This last item is the most likely cause of your issues and I'm sorry to say, there isn't much that can be done about it. Make sure your processes are really gone using the top command mentioned above and if they are, be patient with your computer as it tries to recover large chunks of memory from the disk just after such processes.\n", "Q: Getting a MIMO UM-710S USB Powered 7 Inch LCD Mini Display to work Am interested in a satellite 7-10\" display for my Thinkpad X201 (in addition to already running LCD and main laptop display). I've seen a bunch of mixed info regarding these devices which use Displaylink. Has anyone reliably gotten this to work? if so, how?\n\nA: You will need to install the xserver-xorg-video-displaylink package to get support for this class of devices (identifiable by connecting via USB and presenting a green screen on successful initialisation). The X server does not currently support hotplug events on the USB bus, so you will need to create an xorg.conf file to use such a device. An example xorg.conf file is included in the package (under /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-displaylink/examples).\nIf the above is not working for you, please file a bug against xserver-xorg-video-displaylink: there may be some variation between displaylink devices, which may not be handled completely by the existing driver (but any such lack of support is a bug to be fixed, rather than a result of user error).\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the group list shown on the application launcher? I just installed Unity, on Ubuntu 10.10, to try it out.  I've tried fiddling with a few things, but I can't work out how the applications are grouped and listed.\nI mean - if I click on the Applications in the launcher, we get the list of applications installed, with the option to narrow the selection by group. \ni.e. |Search box|All applications|Accessories|Games|Internet|Media|Office|System|\nMy question is where that list is generated - my machine is mostly for work, so the games have been uninstalled (and I get a \"there are no games on this box\" message, which is nice), and there's a stack of other stuff I'd like to see under a new group of \"work\" or something.\nObviously, a logical follow-up - how does unity know how to classify the applications into those groups?  Is it the info in the .desktop links to them?\n\nA: In System -> Preferences -> Main Menu you can select which menu groups should be shown, and which application should be in which menu group.\n(At least in default Ubuntu, but I guess it should accessible in Unity too)\n\nA: Unity uses .desktop files to categorize things. For the categories there's a field in each application's .desktop file, like this:\nCategories=Utility;Application;\n\nThis will tell it where to categorize the application. You can find more information on that here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\n", "Q: How to reset a password from kwallet? How to reset a password from kwallet?\nI've read about a kwallet GUI that could be installed from synaptic, but I found nothing. Actually, it shows a GUI asking me the password, so it must contain somewhere where I can change this password.\n\nA: Now in 2018 you can just download kwalletmanager5 by typing\nsudo apt install kwalletmanager\n\nThat manager allows you to create and delete your wallets as well as editing the password, provided you know the old password.\n\nA: If Kubuntu automatically created a wallet and it has no known password, it may automatically open during system login, and setting a password may then be possible.\nIf the wallet is closed, if you do not know the current password, it is not possible to \"reset\" it (this would be a security problem). It is only possible to remove the entire wallet and then kwallet should ask you to create a new password.\nIn order to delete the wallet, delete the file:\n/home/<user name>/.kde/share/apps/kwallet/kdewallet.kwl\n\nFor newer versions, the file to delete is located here:\n/home/<user name>/.local/share/kwalletd/kdewallet.kwl\n\nIf you do know the current password, or have it already open, then see Vaibhav Kaushal's answer below.\n\nA: To change the password for KDE wallet, you need to first have it running. If it is not running, start it. \nIn the system tray, you would find its icon. Click on the icon (left-click, not right-click). A new window would open with the list of wallets (by default there is just 1). Right click the wallet and you have the option to change the password. \nTo delete the wallet, you can follow what txwikinger said.\n\nA: Since this question was originally answered, KDE has apparently changed, and I'd like to update this article to keep it useful.\nAs has been pointed out, (through no fault of the O.P.) the original question was indeed unclear: it asked how to reset password but did not supply the motivation:\n\n*\n\n*Remembered password, just resetting\nDo I remember my old KDE Wallet password, but I just want to reset (i.e., \"update\") it, perhaps because it has gotten old or I just want to make a better one? (thus Vaibhav Kaushal's answer)\n\n\n*Lost password\nDid I lose my KDE Wallet password, and therefore the wallet must be deleted and re-created? (thus txwikinger's answer)\nUpdate known KDE password\nIf you do have a KDE Wallet icon showing in your system tray, Vaibhav Kaushal's answer will work.  But this system tray icon does not always show. (You can set that behavior after step 2 below, though, if you like.)\n\n*\n\n*KDE Launcher icon -> Settings -> System Settings (or systemsettings5 from the command prompt)\n\n*Personalization -> Account Details -> KDE Wallet\n\n*Way down in lower right (you may need to scroll down) click on the button, \"Launch Wallet Manager\"  (or again, perhaps, just from the command prompt, type kdewalletmanager5)\n\n*Now you are in the KDE Wallet Manager.\n\n*Assuming you have only one (default) wallet, that wallet will be called kdewallet.  That is the one that should be open in your KDE Wallet Manager now. If not, close any other wallets and open kdewallet.\n\n*Click on \"Change Password\" button to the right.\n\n*Continue with steps 9-12 in section below.\n\nRecreate KDE wallet because of lost password\ntxwikinger's method of deleting the wallet (by deleting the kdewallet.kwl file) no longer works (at least as of my Kubuntu 15.10 / KDE 5).  That is,  (even if kdewallet is running) deleting that .kwl file doesn't result in the kde wallet service now asking you for a new password.  For some reason (at least for me), the system just continues to ask for the (old) password, as if nothing changed.  A bit frustrating.\nNowadays it appears as if the effective way to completely delete a wallet -- so that now KDE Wallet Services does ask you for a new password for the new kdewallet -- is to follow these steps:\n\n\n*First do steps 1 through 5 above\n\n*File -> Delete Wallet,  and in the pop-up window, click 'Delete'.\n\n*File -> New Wallet\n\n*Name: same as before, kdewallet\n\n*Put in your new password twice, hit Enter. You're good to go.\n\n*Close wallet manager and KDE system settings.\n\n*Just a reminder: The next time you try to open something needing the wallet, you may be asked to supply the password again once, each time the KDE Wallet services is re-initiated.\n\n*User tip: Now get a good OFFLINE password manager.  I like KeepassX which works in Linux, Mac, Win.  Put your KDE Wallet password in there.  Back up the password manager's file regularly (I suggest a zero-knowledge cloud such as SpiderOak over Dropbox).\n\n\nA: When I encountered this error on Kubuntu 14.04 a year ago I deleted kdewallet.kwl manually and like Androclus it never prompted me for a new password.\nNow, after a fresh install of K16.04, experiencing the same issue, instead of deleting from the command line I opened the GUI for KWalletManager and deleted all of my wallets (not that I had to.)\nAfter doing so I attempted a wifi connection and was prompted for a new password.\n\nA: I solved this one out by making (from KWalletManager) a new wallet named 'afk' and replacing .salt file from the existing wallet, named 'kdewallet' with .salt file of newly created wallet named 'afk'.\nSo\ncd /home/afk/.kde4/share/apps/kwallet \nmv kdewallet.salt .kdewallet.salt;cp afk.salt kdewallet.salt\n\nAnd now the existing wallet named 'kdewallet' has the password for newly created 'afk' wallet.\nI've deleted the wallet named afk and everything seems to be just fine.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Second Life installer.sh How do I uninstall Second Life I downloaded the Second Life viewer from install.sh\n\nA: If what you mean is that you downloaded the archive from the Secondlife web site, extracted the archive and ran the install.sh script, it depends on where you installed the client when you run the install.sh script.\nIf you ran the script without sudo and elected to continue as such accepting all defaults\nthen the client will be installed in your home directory in a folder called .secondlife-install\njust delete this folder with the following command;\nrm -rf ~/.secondlife-install\nIn System > Preferences > Main Menu, on the left select the Internet group, on the right select the secondlife icon and press the delete button.\nIf you ran the script as sudo and accepted all defaults then the application will be installed in a folder called secondlife-install under the /opt directory, just remove this directory with the following command;\nsudo rm -rf /opt/secondlife-install\nAs usual just be careful with the commands.\nyou can remove the .secondlife folder in your home directory if you do not need it for another client or for retaining Secondlife settings if you intend to try the same or another viewer.\nIt may interest you to note that you do not have to run the install.sh script if you just want to try the viewer and then get rid of it, you can just run the secondlife script in the folder you extracted the archive to. just remember that a .secondlife config and cache directory is created in your home folder this can be deleted safely if you do not have another client that uses that same config and cache directory.\n", "Q: Can NetworkManager be used on a server?

Just that. I think it is an important feature to facilitate collaborative work.\nThis was reported as the wishlist bug #366271\n\nA: This is planned for the future but currently Ubuntu One doesn't have this feature.\nHowever, you should be able to do your own version control (through bzr, git and sync over the version control folders alongside the other synced files. In a folder that is version controlled using bzr, all of the version control information is held in the .bzr folder within the parent folder. As long as this is synced, the version control information should sync.\nI haven't tried this myself but it is probably the best solution until version control is implemented as part of Ubuntu One.\n\nA: This has been on our radar for a while now, yes.\nWe are going to approach releasing this incrementally (ie, probably expose un-deleting files first).\nI don't have a release date for versioning, but it's something we're building towards.

When you connect to a new SSID network via the network manager applet, the key for that network is stored in gnome-keyring under the \"login\" keychain.\nBut when you then change (edit) that network to be \"Available to all users\", the password moves somewhere else.  I'd like to know where, because if it's a PEAP network, that's effectively your Active Directory password.\n\nBackground\nI tick most WIFI networks as \"available to all users\" not to actually make them available (it's a single-user laptop anyway), but rather to prevent anyone from seeing my password for that network in clear text simply by right clicking on the network, clicking on security tab and ticking \"show password\".

He knows what he's talking about. ;-)\n\nYou can just install less.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rubygems and less\nsudo apt-get install rubygems\nsudo gem install less\n\n\n*The official documentation remarks:\n\nTo make gem work properly you should write gem's path to PATH add to ~/.bashrc:\n export PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n*You can then use the less compiler by doing\nlessc style.less\n\nI don't think there's a GUI like the one you've linked to. But since it only seems to be a very shallow gui on top  of the real less compiler, I don't think you'll have any problems using it directly. Type\nlessc --help\n\nto learn how to use it.\nIf you want your .less files to be automatically compiled every time you change them, you can use the -w option:\n~$ lessc test.less -w\n* Watching for changes in test.less...

You can bring them back to the foreground by doing fg, or fg 3 for the third process, to get a list of all of the jobs and their numbers type jobs.\n\nA: Bryan here. Developer of Less.app.\nI highly recommend AGAINST using the older version of LESS (the Ruby-based one). Less.js isn't just a javascript port of LESS, it's a ground-up rewrite that improves a ton of stuff, adds support for things that the old Ruby version doesn't have, and increases compiler speed by about 84%.\nRather than install the Ruby gem, install Node.js and run Less.js through Node from the command line. You'll still have all the -watch functionality, but you'll be using Less.js to do it, which means your life will be much better.\nAlternately, use Less.js as a script in the website you're creating. This will work for development. When you're done coding, simply copy the CSS that Less.js generates (from your browser's inspector) and place that into a file, add a .css extension, then remove the Less.js script tag from the HTML pages and substitute the CSS file you just created. \nEither way, use Less.js.\n\nA: To my knowledge, ruby less isn't updated enough to even handle the concatenation operator. \nFor those interested in a solution that compiles .less upon save for non mac platforms using less.js, you can check out this installation guide*. Though the tutorial is geared towards Windows users, I imagine if you can get Node.js on your system, the script itself will function the same. \n*Disclaimer: This tutorial is mine. Just thought people might want to see specifically what the poster above meant by \"Use Node.js\". I wasn't able to find any scripts online for using Node.js to compile LESS upon file save, so I cooked one up and thought I would share it. \n\nA: Under Ubuntu 11.10, you can simply issue a\nsudo apt-get install lessc\n\n\nA: you can install it the command line compiler in Ubuntu 12.10 as well:\nsudo apt-get install node-less\n\n\nA: There's also http://koala-app.com/.\nhttp://crunchapp.net/ was my favorite, but we have to thank Adobe for discontinuing AIR for Linux.\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu One deal with files changed on more than one computer? What happens if I edit a file on my desktop PC, and edit the same file on my synchronised laptop which is currently not connected to the internet?\nLet's say I have a file called \"jobs.todo\" in \"~/Ubuntu One\" on my desktop, and this contains the following:\nJob 1: description\nJob 2: description\nJob 3: description \nAs I have my laptop connected to the internet, this file will appear on both computers.\nI disconnect my laptop, and take it away with me on a journey. While I'm away, I think of another job I have to get done and add it to the file, which will now read:\nJob 1: description\nJob 2: description\nJob 3: description\nJob 4: description \nWhen I get home, I go back to my desktop and think of something else I need to get done, so I add this to the desktop computer's \"jobs.todo\" file, forgetting that I'd already altered this file on the laptop.\nThis file will read:\nJob 1: description\nJob 2: description\nJob 3: description\nJob 5: description \nand the file will be synchronised with the cloud soon afterwards, because the desktop machine is connected to the internet.\nSome while later, I start up my laptop, it connects itself to the internet wirelessly, and synchronisation with the cloud takes place.\nI suspect that the desktop version (with Job 5 in it) will be copied from the cloud, and I will lose the file containing Job 4, because the datestamp on the cloud's version of the file will be later than that on the laptop\n\nA: What will happen is that when the laptop goes online, the server will tell it it has a new version of the file, and client (specifically syncdaemon) will notice it has a new version of the file also. This is called a conflict, and resolution is up to the client; what syncdaemon does is rename the locally-changed file to originalname.u1conflict, and download the file from the server to the original name. If .u1conflict already exists, it will try with .u1conflict.1, .u1conflict.2, and so on.\nRight now nothing lets you know about the conflict; for 11.04 we'll be letting you know when they happen, and at some point (but not for 11.04) we'll be creating a little app that will help you resolve the conflicts. There isn't an automatic way of doing it, but we should be able to make it easy / userfriendly.\n", "Q: Can I make Compiz Scale plugin show minimized windows?

To that end, the below command will extract the package name from the deb and remove that package name.\ndpkg -r $(dpkg -f your-file-here.deb Package)\n\nNB: this does not confirm that the package being removed is the exact version described by the deb - be careful.\n\nA: Use -r with dpkg.\nSee this blogpost for more information.\n\nA: If your want to remove the package and all configuration files related to it:\nsudo aptitude purge packagename\n\n\nA: apt-get -y Potentially Dangerous:\nAlthough it's true that- sans GUI- our choices are:\n\n*\n\n*apt-get remove (or \"purge\") packageName\n\n*dpkg -r packageName\nWhere dpkg can be executed from a script without the equivalent of a \" -y \" switch, apt requires this to avoid user input.

In the former one, it will appear under local packages and in the latter one under other.\n\nA: To remove package_name, use dpkg with the -r (or --remove) flag:\nsudo dpkg -r package_name\n\nIf you have to force-remove it, add --force-all:\nsudo dpkg -r --force-all pkg_name\n\nUse -P (or --purge) instead of -r if you want to remove the configuration files as well.\n\nA: Open up Ubuntu Software Center (Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center) and search for the package you want to uninstall, and click on the Remove button:  \n \nOr from the command line:\nsudo apt-get remove <package-name>\n\n\nA: obviously, You can use the remove and force flags:\nsudo dpkg -r --force-all    'some_bad_package'\n\nbut in very many cases that won't help at all. Neither will it help in case of dpkg breakage to try any of the GUI tools like synaptic or even worse ones, since they all depend on dpkg . This is because dpkg is very opinionated on those often-occurring errors, leaving many users marooned.

By default is with super+Numpad-Arrows.\n\nA: I like Put to next Output with Ctrl + Alt + n\nenjoy it!\n\nPut at CCSM.\n\nPut to Next Output\n\nA: After install CCSM, to add \"put\" option, you must install too :\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\n\nA: On my machine (CentOS Linux 7) it worked out of the box:\nUse window key+shift+arrows this will move window quickly between monitors\nWorks on maximized as well as non maximized windows.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager \nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Run CCSM → Go to bottom (Window Management) → Go to \"Put.\"\n\n*Enable the plugin.\n\n*Configure shortcut for \"Put to next Output.\"\n\n*Log out and back in again.\n\n\nIf the plugin put doesn't appear in CCSM, install the compiz-plugins  package. (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins)\nEDIT: The required plugin package is now called compiz-plugins on 12.10 and higher. compiz-plugins-extra  is still used for 12.04.\n\nA: Alt+Ctrl + NumLeft/NumRight\nfor minimised window only (!) I found today in Gnome 3 @ Ubuntu 14.04.\ni.e., if you wan to move maximized window, you may\n'Win + DownArrow', 'Alt+Ctrl+ NumLeft/NumRight', 'Win + UpArrow'\nor try to bind it..\n\nA: Addendum: If the solution with Put plugin doesn't work.\nTry to disable some features you don't use that may interfere.

I am trying to copy a .tar.gz file from a remote host. If I mount that host using Krusader and copy it takes a lot of time. However, if I use rsync, it is about 5-6 times faster. How come? Is there a way that I can take advantage of this speed while still be using Krusader (or a similar tool)?\n\nA: \nif I use rsync, it is about 5-6 times faster. How come?\n\nA few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync uses a clever algorithm to compute a binary diff between two files on different machines and to send only the differences\n\n*it tries very hard to keep the tcp pipe totally full, whereas sftp or other protocols can sometimes stall waiting for earlier data to arrive\n\n*rsync is smart about gzipping files that are likely to benefit from it\n\n\nTo say more means knowing more about the specific situation and what you're comparing it to.\n\nA: Rsync was made specifically for speed and conservation of bandwidth. There a GUI front end for rsync called grsync.\nsudo apt-get install grsync\n\n\nA: Another thing that might be of interest: \nIf the remote machine is running a rsyncd daemon, rsync is able to transfer data without using ssh encryption which is likely to be much faster, at least over gigabit ethernet or even faster connections (even fast cpus today can only encrypt/decrypt about 30-40 megabytes/second on standard ssh settings (on one core), whereas gigabit ethernet should be able to transfer about 90 megabytes/second).\n", "Q: How does the Software Center keep track of packages? How does the Software Center keep track of installed packages? In which files/database?\n\nA: dpkg (Software-Center is a graphical front-end of dpkg) keeps track of the installed packages in /var/lib/dpkg/status.\n\nA: From what I can tell, it uses xapian databases located at /var/cache/software-center/xapian. \nFrom a quick read over the code here, specifically the 'rebuild_database' function, it looks like the above are built/re-built from the apt cache (using the Python-apt wrapper, which in turn uses libapt-pkg).\n", "Q: Why have both /mnt and /media? It seems to me that having both /mnt and /media is a little redundant. Is there any tangible difference between the two that I'm not aware of?\nIs there a standard that most people follow for where to mount things, e.g. use one for certain types of devices, or is this completely subjective?\n\nA: Another important difference not mentioned yet is that devices mounted under /mnt will not appear in Nautilus' left pane, whilst those mounted under /media (as well as auto-detected devices that are not mounted yet) will.\nSo for example, if you don't want a certain partition to appear in the \"Devices\" subsection of Nautilus' left pane, you should create a subdirectory for it under /mnt, write an entry for said partition in your /etc/fstab (or do it through the Disks utility) and assign the newly created directory as its mount point:\n/dev/{block_device_name)   /mnt/{descriptive_name}   {fs_type}   {mount,options}  0 2\n\nEven better, add the noauto mount option in fstab/Disks and then your partition won't appear in Nautilus nor will it be mounted (preventing accidental mess with its files)! So for example, in the case of a dual-boot with Windows you could have:\n/dev/sda1   /mnt/win7   ntfs-3g   rw,user,noauto,gid=100,uid=1000,nls=utf8,umask=002   0 0\n\nin your /etc/fstab, and hence have your Windows partition not showing up in Nautilus (but still accessible through the mount command if you ever need it).\nHere is a screenshot I made with a liveUSB, showing all three cases:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*auto-detected devices not mounted (\"16 GB Volume\" /dev/sdb1)\n\n*devices mounted on a /media subdirectory and showing up in Nautilus (\"iso\" /dev/sdb2)\n\n*my Windows partition /dev/sda3 mounted on /mnt but not showing up in Nautilus left pane (it would be the same if it wasn't mounted since I have an entry for it in my fstab).\n\n\nOn the contrary, I want my shared data partition to show up in nautilus, so I assigned a /media mount point to it and set the auto mount option, so I can just click on Data and access it from the GUI.\nTo me this is THE big difference between those two directories, that I learned about when trying to do just what I explained ;-)\n\nA: This thing goes deeper:\nI like to keep internal drives mounted on /mnt, and external removables on /media.\nThis post illustrates a difference in functioning, where /media blocked access to certain system and user processes, (because of the default limiting umask attached to any drive that is mounted) where as /mnt acted like the host filesystem.\n\nA: As I understand it, /media is for mounting things like optical drives and other temporary media, where /mnt is usually for permanently attached storage (generally internal disks).\nOf course, you can also mount a device anywhere you want... the /mnt and /media directories are more conventional though.\n\nA: The new standard is that /media is where the system mounts removable media, and /mnt is for you to mount things manually.\nSee the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS) for details.\n\nA: /mnt was already accepted as a place to manually and temporarily mount external media.  The /media directory was created as a place under which multiple media, external or otherwise, could be automatically mounted.\n", "Q: Doesn't boot after installing fglrx for ati 5650 I'm a complete noob here, I recently bought an HP 3161 with an ATI 5650 hd card, when I installed 10.04 LTS everything was working fine until I was prompted to activate proprietary driver fglrx, after I did this I couldn't reboot (not even in recovery mode) until I reinstalled 10.04, what can I do?\nI would appreciate any help since I haven't been able to find anyone with the same problem, thanks.\n\nA: In addition to the solution below, if you ever have this again, you can simply uninstall fglrx via terminal. I had a similar issue with my 4670 and fglrx. After I installed it and activated the driver, it would not boot.\nFollow this Natty Installation Guide (there may be other methods around).\nOnce that is done, run:\nrm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nand if you are logged in as your own account on terminal, just add sudo.\nGood luck! :)\n\nA: If your hardware specs are like mine (Intel/ATI Radeon HD 5650, switchable graphics), then know that the fglrx driver currently does not support systems with switchable graphics, and not much can be done about it now since the driver is proprietary.\nYour only option is to use the open source radeon driver (which currently doesn't support 3d acceleration AFAIK), or wait until fglrx is updated to support switchable graphics.\nUPDATE\nAMD has released an updated driver \n (11.5 as of this edit) that finally supports switchable graphics. I highly recommend using the instructions for your version of Ubuntu.\nI used the instructions for 11.04 Natty and Catalyst 11.5 and the installation was smooth and successful. I suggest reading the page thoroughly before proceeding so that you know how to recover in case something doesn't go well.\n", "Q: What is the best file system on top of LVM encryption? On my (early SSD) laptop I normally choose to put everything in an encrypted LVM because I'm a bit paranoid. :) I assume that all of the great performance features of the file systems such as ext4 assume a lot about the distribution of data that simply isn't true when there's an encryption layer on top. To that end, what is the best file system on top of a layer of encryption? Is it JFS since it \"does less\" and there for is computationally less expensive?\n\nA: dm-crypt doesn't depend on LVM. It can encrypt any block device, like CDs, even swap space.\nIt supports a bunch of modes of operation, some of which impact performance more than others, and all of which interact differently with the file system. The encryption doesn't necessarily operate using the same block size as the device itself: the XEX-TCB-CTS mode of operation (XTS) deliberately uses blocks that are not evenly divisible by the hardware block sizes, for example.\nHowever, in reality, the overhead from the encryption is so large that it doesn't make any difference at all. I therefore recommend you choose your file system based on reliability considerations. \nAs maaartinus points out, if your CPU supports the AES-NI instruction set (cat /proc/cpuinfo to find out), encryption will be fast enough that it may make sense to test different filesystems. However the differences between various filesystems should still be comparable to using no encryption at all, and the usual advice would hold. I still recommend to choose a file system based on considerations of reliability, not speed. \n", "Q: How to eliminate/deactivate Ubuntu One account?

Both the downgrade and cancel options are available in the Account area. Click on \"View/Edit\" and you will find links to downgrade or cancel your subscription. \n", "Q: What do \"Unamplified\" and \"100%\" mean when describing \"Output volume\"? Ubuntu's sound preferences dialog (the one you get to by clicking on the little speaker icon in the indicator applet) has a couple notches on the slider, one marked \"Unamplified\" and one marked \"100%\". And the thing doesn't stop at 100% either.\n\nSo what does 100% mean if it doesn't mean either \"the signal without amplification\" or \"as loud as I can make it\"?\nWhere do I want it set if I want the strongest signal sent to my speakers without danger of clipping?\n\nA: You are seeing this because your sound card supports amplification beyond the normal range of the actual volume. Unamplified is the normal maximum, the next marker (100%) represents the maximum amplification that your sound card supports (ie how much your sound card can amplify sound on it's own), and the highest one (the unmarked end of the slider) is the amplification that is available from pulseaudio (on top of what your sound card supports).\nThe safest is Unamplified%, but 100% (the second marker) might also be safe depending on the volume of what you are playing and your speaker quality. If you are playing very low volume audio files, and you don't want to use normalization, you can use these features to your advantage.\n", "Q: Window management shortcuts?

I downloaded the N64 emulator off of the Software center a while ago, and I was doing OK with using the keyboard.  Then a friend of mine gave me the brilliant idea of getting a USB controller.  So I got it and it was working fine with the Mupen64Plus, the GFCE Ultra NES, and the ZSNES emulators, until I got the rom for Turok.  The controls are different in that game than the others, and utilizes the four yellow \"C\" buttons that would be on a N64 controller. The Logitech (F310 if it might be useful to know) I got, looks much more like a PS2 or PS3 controller... four buttons on the right, 2 360 directional sticks that push down as a separate button, etc..\nSo Turok uses the four yellow \"C\" buttons as the main movement for it's character.  I don't have so many buttons so I started to mess with using the \"U\" and \"V\" axis 360 directional stick.  \nAll of a sudden, the controller started to manipulate the cursor, and before I knew it the mouse arrow was sliding to the top left corner of the screen.  It wouldn't interact with the controller anymore, and the mouse itself, when moved, would move with great resistance back to the top left corner of the screen.  \nMy immediate solution solution was to unplug the controller from the USB.\nNow, every time I plug the controller back in, it sends the cursor flailing into the corner of my screen.\nI've looked up getting all sorts of \"jscalibrators\" and other junk from the Software center and I've typed stuff into the terminal from other forums, postings that asked similar questions, but it's been totally hit or miss... mostly miss.\nI can't quite figure out what to tell the computer to do to stop thinking the gamepad is the mouse. I been get so frustrated about this over the past two days, I've been taking afternoon naps after researching and fighting for a few hours. \nLogitech support hung up on me before even connecting me to a human.\nHow do I keep the controller from thinking it's the mouse?\n\nA: You need to look at your xinput configuration:\nxinput -l\n\nYou have your gamepad plugged in and it's probably configured under the Core Pointer, not only that but instead of the inputs being button 8, 9 etc. they've been configured to the x/y axis by mistake.\nUse xinput to remove the gamepad from the core pointer.\n", "Q: How to control order of startup items in Gnome? How would you control the order of startup items in Gnome?\nFor example on my system I have a program called Tilda that requires that Compiz be loaded so that transparency will work, otherwise if it isn't I have to manually close and reopen the program once it is loaded for the transparency to work.\nI have tried using the startup applications, and editing the launcher to add sleep 3 && tilda but this doesn't seem to work.\nSo is there anyway to control the order of startup items so that programs that require compiz or some other feature like the notification area(for dock only setups not using the gnome-panel)?\n\nA: You have the right idea using the command sleep 3 && tilda, but that doesn't work.\nIf you look in ~/.xsession-errors you probably find the following error message:  \nsleep: invalid time interval `&&'\nsleep: invalid time interval `tilda'\nTry `sleep --help' for more information.\n\nThis is because the command is not executed like it would be if you ran it from a terminal.\nThe workaround for this is to change the command to bash -c \"sleep 3 && tilda\".\nMore detailed information on session startup ordering: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1119945.\n\nA: Open gedit (or any other text editor you might like) and paste in the following\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile [ -z `pgrep compiz` ]; do\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\ntilda\n\nSave it as .tildastart.sh in your homefolder.

It will ask for confirmation of each command you will try to execute.\nPlease note that this is nothing more than a proof-of-concept hack; I doubt it can really be any useful in this form. If you will have to confirm each and every command you type, you will very soon acquire a habit to automatically hit \"yes\" after each command.

I'd like to build a machine running Ubuntu and using the new Sandy bridge (i5 2500 specifically) intel cpu's. I heard that 10.10 doesn't have the best support (or simply won't work) with the new cpus and 1155 mobos. I'm assuming that 11.04 will have support but do the alpha's have it already? Or will I have to wait? Also, I plan to use the onboard Intel graphics (H67 mobo), will there be support for this or will I still need to use a graphic's card?\n\nA: I got the Asus P8P67 Pro and core i5 2500K.  I plugged in my old hard drives and it booted right up.  The only problems I have found so far are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't suspend with the USB 3 enabled.  Unloading the xhci_hcd module resolves that.\n\n*No ACPI temperature monitoring, so I had to load the pkgtemp module.  Contacted ASUS about fixing this in future bios rev.\n\n*No fan control.  Contacted ASUS, hopefully they will tell me what chip drives the fan and I can patch lm-sensors to interface with it, or they will add proper ACPI FAN support in the next rev of the bios.\n\n*After overclocking, the bios supplied cpu frequency table is wrong.  The auto oc option set the base clock to 3.4 GHz with 4.3 GHz on turbo boost, but the ACPI P-state table claims it runs at 5.8 GHz.  Contacted ASUS and awaiting bios update.\n\n\nThis is all with Maverick.  I will do some more testing with Natty.  The one time I did, suspend seemed to work fine without having to unload the USB 3 driver.\nFYI, I had an Athlon 64 5000+ Black Edition with dual cores before.  That took 22 seconds to build e2fsprogs.  New setup takes under 6.  I am also using my existing Radeon HD card.\n\nA: This is Michael Larabel of Phoronix. Sandy Bridge CPU and Cougar Point chipset support under Linux is quite good, sans the graphics bugs and small other hiccups (as pointed out in my articles and already in this thread, don't expect your motherboard to necessarily have LM_Sensors support, there may be some SnR problems, USB3 is generally fine but under some scenarios can be iffy, etc).\nIn terms of the graphics problems I have noted that some people say is due to a system mis-configuration on my part, that is not the case. Intel's Jesse Barnes is able to reproduce the most severe issue I reported of stability problems / tiling corruption when the system endures enough load. This doesn't seem to happen to everyone or they don't realize it as the system must be under lots of load, but it's happening with at least select ASUS motherboards. I'm waiting on a new board from Intel to see how that goes and how the Linux graphics performance is once everything is working.\n\nA: It is still very bad. ATI catalyst does not work. Even the newest downloaded version. Kernel 3.0-rc5 still did not help. There was a package called acpi_call, that did not work either. After setting \"acpi_osi=linux pci=noacpi\", it booted normally. I don't know if the fancontrol I installed as service, is working or not, but it runs much cooler than its default setting.

Open Daemon Tool in Windows and see if you can convert .mdx to .iso. \n\n\nA: With the package iat, available from the standard repositories, it is possible to convert a .mdx file, to an easy mountable .iso file.\n\nA: You can use CDemu:\nhttps://cdemu.sourceforge.io/about/libmirage/\nafter installation just run:\ncdemu load 0 your_image.mdx and it will appear as CD-ROM you can mount.\nYou can also use GUI of your choice like gcdemu.\nAll of them are available in this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~cdemu/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\n", "Q: How to add sound to NotifyOSD?

How do I best update lm-sensors to work with recent hardware?\nI have a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.10 server, and get the following:\n$ sudo apt-get install lm-sensors\n$ sensors\nNo sensors found! [...] \nTry sensors-detect [...]\n$ sudo sensors-detect\n[...]\nDriver 'to-be-written':\n  * Chip \"Nuvoton W83667HG-B Super IO Sensors\" (confidence: 9)\nNote: there is no driver for [this sensor] yet.\nCheck http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Devices for updates.\n\nThe link tells me that this chip is supported from kernel 2.6.36 (while Ubuntu 10.10 is using 2.6.35) or by using a standalone driver.\nWhat is the simplest way to update lm-sensors?\n\nA: These are the primary alternatives:\nWait it out: If you don't consider sensor readings critical you may just wait for the next Ubuntu release, which may include support for the chip by default. \nStandalone driver: If you don't want to wait, a standalone driver may be the best option, as it makes minimal changes to the rest of the system. See below for how to install it.\nUpgrade the kernel: This is somewhat more risky, as you will be running an unsupported and untested combination of Ubuntu version and kernel version - upgrading the kernel may fix the sensor support while breaking something else. Upgrading the kernel may also work just fine, as long as you are prepared to roll back in case it doesn't.\nThe simplest way to upgrade the kernel is to use one of Ubuntu's prebuilt kernel packages, see ubuntu.com kernel builds for instructions. \n\nInstalling a standalone driver\nRead the Ubuntu compiling HOWTO, install compiling tools:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nDownload the source code for the driver\n    wget [.h, .c and Makefile files]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile, install and load the new module.

Okay, in my GUI, Ubuntu only allowed me to set a resolution for 1360x768 and 1024x768 even though I know darn well my P76 monitor is capable of 1280x1024.\nSo, after a little investigation I used cvt and xrandr to figure out that I can add these lines to my /etc/gdm/Init/Default file (first four lines are actually one line, I've just split it for readability):\nxrandr --newmode 1280x1024  109.00\n                 1280 1368 1496 1712\n                 1024 1027 1034 1063\n                 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024\n\nNow, that works fine, I find that the login screen is actually in 1280x1024.\nHowever, when I actually log in, it reverts to 1024x768 which is a serious pain.\nThe output from xrandr shows:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 4096 x 4096\nVGA1 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mmx0mm\n   1360x768       59.8  \n   1024x768       60.0* \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0  \n   640x480        59.9     59.9  \n   1280x1024      59.9  \n\nso I'm guessing that it's the fact the preferred resolution is 1024x768 (since that has the * next to it) that's causing my reversion to that resolution. Executing:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024\n\nfrom a terminal window fixes it but I'd prefer an automatic solution.\nHow do I set the preferred resolution to be 1280x1024 (if that is indeed my problem)? \nCan this be done with another xrandr command and should this be in /etc/gdm/Init/Default or somewhere else?\n\nA: First, you should try to change the resolution using System->Preferences->Monitors, and then reboot. It's likely that it's stored somewhere and it will be restored it at login.\nIf it doesn't work you can add the xrand command to the items in System->Preferences->Start up Applications.\nYou will only need to add the last line:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024\n\nThe files is /etc/gdm/Init/Default are executed when the gdm (the login window) starts, not when a session loads.\n", "Q: Wireless will not connect with an AzureWave chipset I have installed Ubuntu 10.10 on the same machine as my windows setup.\nHowever, it will not connect to my wireless network.

Can we start an IPv6 FAQ and checklist for a (*)Ubuntu home user, covering both hardware and software?\nThe answers can cover the following areas:\n\n\n*\n\n*ISP readiness.\n\n*Home router readiness and configuration.\n\n*(*)Ubuntu configuration.\n\n*Since when has ()Ubuntu been IPv6 ready? (Do we really need the latest version of ()Ubuntu?)\n\n*How to configure LAN and cross-LAN services (SSH, /etc/hosts, etc.)?\n\n*and more.\n\n\nA: The following question covers much of the same ground, but is not *ubuntu-centric:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/1634/ipv6-for-home-users \n\nA: Randomly generated private IPv6 address range:\nhttp://www.simpledns.com/private-ipv6.aspx\nCheck your IPv4/6 connectivity:\nhttp://test-ipv6.com/\n\nA: SixXS provide a very helpful FAQ to various aspects of IPv6: http://www.sixxs.net/faq/\nThe Linux Kernel itself has IPv6 support since Linux 2.6 - at least since 2004. Most applications shipped with Ubuntu support IPv6 at least since Ubuntu 10.04 (This is the first version, with which I played around with IPv6). Normally you don't have to configure anything to work with IPv6, I just does.\n", "Q: What filesystem should I choose for netbook? I`ve an EeePC netbook. What filesystem should I choose for Ubuntu installation?\nI also want to make a partion accessible for ubuntu and win. What should I choose?\n\nA: For system (Ubuntu) ext4 -- it's default choice in Ubuntu and I think the best for all use.\nIf you want access a partition from both Ubuntu and Windows, best solution probably is NTFS or FAT32 (native Windows filesystems with r/w support in Ubuntu).\n\nA: To acheive what you seek would involve a compromise in one way or the other, as for whether the compromise is acceptable probably depends what you intend to store on the shared partition.\nThere is not to my knowledge any filesystem that supports all the features you have come to expect on filesystems of each OS.  The primary reason for that is each filesystem was built with a specific platform in mind (NTFS/FAT32 for windows, EXT3/4 for linux).\nThat said there are ways to get some level of shared acess and we come back to what you are storing.  In general your best options are probably FAT32 or maybe NTFS, Linux support for these are more mature and in Ubuntu by default unlike windows support for EXT3/4.  If like when I was dual booting the main files shared on that partition are such as media files or other non sensitive data, etc the loss of permissions are probably less of a big issue for you.  That may also be similarly true if you are the sole person with direct access to the machine in question.\nAnother concideration may however be which system you use the majority of the time, there may be something to be said about choosing a filesystem format that best supports the OS you use most often.  Though I don't know enough to recommend the EXT3/4 support options that can apparently be added to windows, if they are not sufficiently mature data loss could be a risk.  Do your research before trusting any software with that level of filesystem access.\nOf course another question is do you need a fully shared file system, how much data are we talking and could such as a USB flash drive be used to hold this data?  That would eliminate the permissions issue down to looking after the physical device.\nThat should give you a few options to consider, I advise having a think about what you need doing your research of the limitations and benefits of each option and select the one which best suits your situation.\n", "Q: Software to burn CDs and DVDs I have been trying to use Brasero to copy CDs , but it asks for toc2cue and cdrdao installation, I tried K3b and it says K3b can not copy multi-tracks. Can anyone suggest a software which would not give me hard times (something like Nero but free). Thanks!\n\nA: I recommend sticking with Brasero. I presume you're trying to burn a non-standard disk image format and that's why Brasero is asking for cue2toc and cdrdao. You could just install those packages and be on your way:\nsudo apt-get install cue2toc cdrdao\n\nAlthough I admit that this is a paper cut in usability and you should report it as a bug here:\nhttps://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+filebug\nPlease explain exactly what you're trying to do, with what kind of files and what makes it different from burning normal iso files.

This is resolved by editing /etc/apt/sources.list and changing every occurance of intrepid into jaunty. You can do this manually or use wojox' oneliner (which requires perl to be installed). Note that we assume that the jaunty repos are still up, which they were at the time of writing.\nsudo perl -p -i.intrepid -e 's/intrepid/jaunty/' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNote - Ubuntu provides mirrors to old releases: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Intrepid\n\n*Update the package list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install update-manager-core\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\n\n*Run do-release-upgrade which will handle the update to the next version properly (and make sure being on ssh is not a hindrance). Keep in mind that although we changed the source list earlier, we are still on the version we started out. So in my case, I had to do step 4 three times. Be sure to reboot between each upgrade. Note that in case of doubt on your current Ubuntu version, you can always issue\ncat /etc/issue\n\n\nA: It may not work because you you have to go in chronological order. 8.10 > 9.04 > 9.10 > 10.04 and 9.04 is EOL as well.\nsudo perl -p -i.intrepid -e 's/intrepid/jaunty/' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\nA: I haven't tried this, but it may be possible, instead of doing a manual upgrade, to switch your /etc/apt/sources.list from using \"http://*archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\" to using \"http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\". Then try the normal path of using do-release-upgrade. The updater will likely complain that you're not using an \"official mirror\", but go ahead with it. Once you're at 9.04, you can switch the sources.list back to the official mirrors and upgrade to 9.10 and continue normally, maybe.\nI am worried that do-release-upgrade will just bomb out since it doesn't know about the EOL releases at all.\n", "Q: Error when I try to compile the kernel 2.6.37 I have downloaded the kernel 2.6.37 from kernel.org.\nI have tried to compile it but I get an error:\n$ make menuconfig\nscripts/kconfig/conf --silentoldconfig Kconfig\n***\n*** Configuration file \".config\" not found!\n***\n*** Please run some configurator (e.g. \"make oldconfig\" or\n*** \"make menuconfig\" or \"make xconfig\").\n***\nmake[2]: *** [silentoldconfig] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [silentoldconfig] Error 2\nmake: *** No rule to make target `include/config/auto.conf', needed by `include/config/kernel.release'.

I just got my laptop's battery replaced and read a bit about how to prolong it's life. Most people say that the best choice is not to charge it will 100%, but rather to 60-80%. My battery is quite powerful (8 hours declared), so it's okay for me to charge it like this, and I mainly work plugged in.\nIn Windows which ships with the laptop I can see the way to set the threshold, and there is even the auto mode, where system decides itself how much to charge.\nIs there something like this in Ubuntu?\n\nA: For IBM Thinkpads there exist a module tp_smapi to control charge thresholds. It you fix the start charge threshold at 60% and stop at 95%, the battery will charge upto 95% and stop charging (It will not discharge either). Once the AC power goes off the laptop will discharge but will not start recharging, even if plugged into AC, till the battery has discharged below 60%. Its  useful feature to increase battery life as Li-ion batteries are best stored at 40%. If you don't often go off AC power the battery will remain at 40-60% as per threshold set by you and hence last for a long time. I'm not aware if the same module would work for other laptops as well.\nSam - IBM Thinkpad - R52/R60. \n\nA: You can install Dells Airplane manager(Download) when you battery is 80% charged open it and enable airplane mode so now the laptop will not charge and run off ac power.\n", "Q: How do I control Front and Back volume independently with cloned stereo signal I have my 7.1 soundcard set to stereo and plugged in two stereo thingies (a. my desktop speakers b. my stereo) to the front respectively rear plug. Now I would like to an easy way to mute/volume control them independently - gui if possible. \nIf I set my soundcard to 4.0, the pulse audio mixer gives me sliders for front and back but the problem is that's the input signal. so if i mute the front there and I'm listening to stereo everything remains silent. But what I'd have liked in that scenario would be the front to be silent and the back playing the full stereo signal.\nIs there a way to do that or something similar? \n\nA: The mixers that ship in Ubuntu are all very flimsey in my opinion but there are a couple of good options that are simple to install.\n\n\n*\n\n*ALSAMixer is usually the first port of call for telling people how to fix muted channels, etc but it's a fairly robust text-mode mixer. I would suggest this over the GUI alternatives (gnome-alsamixer as one example) because they lack polish and that makes them harder to use.\nIf it's not already installed, it's as simple as:\nsudo apt-get install alsamixer\nalsamixer\n\n\n\n*padevchooser is another option. It's a lot more than just a mixer - it's a whole suite of tools for managing pulseaudio. Rather than being console-based \nsudo apt-get install padevchooser\npadevchooser\n\nWhen it's running you should see a new icon in your Notification Area (near the clock). Click it and select Volume Control. Under Output Devices you should be able to manage the volumes on a per-channel basis.\n\nYou might want to add padevchooser to your list of start-up applications (in System -> Preferences)\n\nA: You need pavucontrol:\napt-get install pavucontrol\n\nThis is basically pulse audio advanced controls featuring single channels mixing.\n", "Q: Does \"CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=x\" affect to all compilations made with make?

What 'other media' is this referring to, and how is the installation of wireless hardware handled. Does Ubiquity attempt to recognise the computer's wireless device and install the appropriate drivers or does it just dump a 'proprietary wireless driver module' into the kernel and be done with it? How does it react if the computer has no wireless card?\n\nA: Install This third-party software\nThird Party are ALL software that does not come normally recommended (100% free software) with Ubuntu in the CD/DVD. For example the Flash and MP3 are proprietary (Until a better software emerges which i have high hopes like Lightspark and Gnash). Wireless, Video and other proprietary drivers are also taken as a third party. They are in the repo like Nvidia and Broadcom but they are still proprietary. So basically if you install all Third Party it will include all the NEEDED drivers and software to have your Ubuntu running in top shape for any type of normal use.\nThe third party depends in what hardware you have for the third party drivers it will install. The rest of mp3, flash and such will always get installed.\nI will add that wine is not in the third party since a standard user would not need to use this (Am not the standard ;) ).\nIf you select Download Updates While Installing it will search in the repositories for any update available up to that day.\n\nA: The \"Install this third-party software\" checkbox does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It installs ubuntu-restricted-addons much later on in the main install process.  This currently includes gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly, flashplugin-installer (Adobe Flash support), gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad, gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg, icedtea6-plugin (Java and the browser plugin for it), and gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3 (MP3 playback support).\n\n*It asks the Additional Drivers (jockey) program to enable any drivers that can be automatically installed.  Currently this is limited to just the Broadcom wireless (binary) driver.\n\n\nIf the computer is not connected to the Internet, the install will complete successfully; however, the following will happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your location will not be automatically determined on the 'Where are you?' page.\n\n*The set of locations you can look up by typing in the box on the 'Where are you?' page will be limited to just the cities that represent a timezone (Oslen database locations).\n\n*If you have checked the 'Download updates while installing' box, this step will be skipped.\n\n*If you have selected a language without full language support shipped on the CD, the language support packages will not be downloaded as part of the Ubuntu installation process.\n\n", "Q: How to run game on one monitor and have programs on other monitor still visible? How can i make programs on second monitor still visible while playing game (Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory)?\nI know that i can use windowed mode, but playing in windowed kinda feels different, like game has a lot of tiny video lags.  \nEDIT1: I am running gnome on latest ubuntu, and while one monitor has game on it and other is completely black (my notifications are set up so they pop up on second monitor) i can see notifications (libnotify and skype).\n\nA: Windowed is as good as I've got, I'm afraid but to be fair, doing it any other way will be just as laggy because the system is rendering more. It's overlaying your game on a desktop as well as the other uncovered desktop and those applications, so yeah, it's a little more intensive and that's going to hurt in-game performance.\nCoincidentally, I also use Compiz to make certain screen-sized windows render with fullscreen hinting (so they show above the panel, without window decoration). You can do this by opening CCSM (compizconfig-settings-manager), heading down to Window Rules, enabling it and entering a rule for your game's window.\nThis won't help performance, it'll just make it look how you'd expect. \n\nA: Somehow was possible to make start programm in one of screens.\nBut how to get mouse go out of game?\nAnother way to try would be using 2 computers and one set of PC controlers (mouse/keyb) using programm Quick-Synergy. With it u can move mouse to end of screen and control other PC.\n\nA: If you want to juice the last bit of performance out of your Ubuntu gaming setup install fluxbox and run your games from that. It may lack the cute bells and whistles that you're used to, but it will have better performance. That said: windowed is as good as it gets.

Even then, the disk's sysfs directory is still present in /sys/bus/scsi/drivers/sd and you need to manually echo 1 > delete to make sure the SCSI device is unregistered. Without it, replugging the disk back in does not work.\nSo my question is - is there a program that can detect when a physical disk that's been device mapped is no longer responding and perform the necessary cleanup?\n\nA: I am not aware of a program to do that for you however I had a device at one stage which would periodically end up in this state by suddenly disconnecting itself.  It would reconnect fine after manually going through the steps you describe above, my solution relied on noticing that when it happened the mount point did show as empty though the system still believed something was mounted.\nMy solution, put a simple empty file onto the drive the presence of which could then be checked for by a shell script and automatically clean up.  I no longer have the drive or the full shell script but I can give you a basic example how to create your own and you can add in the commands you had to run in order to clean up manually when you did that.\nNote in this example I will use /mnt/externalhd as the mountpoint and presume that the file we are looking for is named .isonline in it's root filesystem.  You could check for the presence of an existing file on the drive also assuming that it will not ever change during operation.  Note that the if statement also checks for the /dev entry so we dont create a loop of cleanups while waiting for the device to reconnect, finding and using the disks correct /dev/disk/by-uuid/* entry would be more accurate however and essential if the order of connection of your devices may vary a problem I fortunately never had.\nif [ ! -e /mnt/externalhd/.isonline ] && [ -e /dev/sdb ]; then {\n   # This line optionally logs the disconnect to a file for your records.\n   echo \"`date '+%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S'` OFFLINE: /dev/sdb disconnected, cleaning up\" >> /var/log/externalhd.log\n\n   # Do whatever you need to do to clean up the bad unmount and enable reconnection\n\n   # Optionally log the completion of the cleanup process\n   echo \"`date '+%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S'` CLEANUP: /dev/sdb cleanup process completed\" >> /var/log/externalhd.log\n}\nfi\n\nI hope that helps, I am a little fuzzy on the commands I had to run to complete the full cleanup and it seems that I deleted the old script when the drive itself finally died.  Once you have the script set up with the commands you need to run to clean up your drive they will be the same ones you use when doing it manually though you should drop the sudo part from them.\nThe script can then be run via cron to do a regular check for a bad unmount and automatically clean up whenever one is detected.  Assuming that the script is saved in /home/user/cleanumount then the following steps can add a cron job for it the example will run the check every 5 minutes.\nFirst run the following command:\nsudo crontab -u root -e\nYou may be asked to select a text editor from a list by pressing a number from a menu if so simply choose your preferred editor by pressing the corresponding number.\nThen add the following two lines to your crontab (The top line is an optional but recommended comment so you know what it does).\n# Run /home/user/cleanumount every 5 minutes to cleanly unmount /dev/sdb after sudden disconnects\n*/5 * * * *    /home/user/cleanumount\n\nThen save your file and exit the text editor the new crontab will automatically be installed and loaded into the cron daemon.\nIn the event that 5 minutes is not frequent enough you can adjust the first part of the line, change it to a simple * to run every minute or for example */2 for every 2 minutes */3 for every 3 minutes and so on.  More detailed information on the crontab can be found by running man 5 crontab\nHope you find that useful, that is unless some other clever person comes along with a nifty tool to make all this information I wrote out for you redundant if so fantastic :)\n", "Q: How to Fix Firefox when it freezes completely after open it? \nFirst time ever today Firefox Version 3.6.13 freezed for me on Ubuntu 10.10 64bit.\nI open Firefox normally but then nothing respond on the GUI.The only thing I can do is close it.\nWhen Closed I try to re-open but the application still runs on the background\nSo I have to kill it manually along with Firefox-bin from the System monitor or kill pid command ..\nI don´t know what caused this..I suspect Addons or maybe a proxy setting with polipo.\nI also installed DockbarX this morning but it seems ok with Chromium now.\nSame story after rebooting,\nSo I left it as it is to find a solution from AskUbuntu\nWhat can I do now? Where do I check the Logs to locate the problem?\nHow do I get back my working Firefox without Re-installation ?\nAny Suggestion is welcome.\n\nA: It sounds possible you have a problem with an Add-On causing an issue.\nI would suggest attempting to start firefox in safe mode with all your addons etc disabled and see if that stops the application freezing on startup.  You can do so by running the following command.\nfirefox -safe-mode\nYou should then get a dialog box with several options make sure that Disabled all add-ons is checked and click on Continue in Safe Mode.  There are other options there to reset certain settings and features that you can also try if it turns out not to be an Add-On conflict.  If that resolves the issue remember safe mode only applies for this session so you will now want to resolve which add-on is causing firefox to freeze.\nFirst while in safe mode go to Tools > Add-Ons and disable all installed Add-Ons there that will make firefox run with no Add-Ons next time it is started in normal mode.  At that point close firefox down and start it in normal mode to ensure it still runs without freezing and that all Add-Ons are indeed disabled.\nYour next course of action if this is all working still is to attempt to enable each Add-On you have in turn, restarting firefox in between each to identify the Add-On which is causing firefox to freeze note it could also be a combination of Add-Ons so in the event that enabling only one at a time does not cause the symptoms next try these steps.\nAfter running through every Add-On singly start enabling all your Add-Ons again restarting with each you enable until you produce the freeze, at that point you know that the last one you activated is conflicting with one of the others enabled prior.  You can then use the safe mode trick to disable the others and try each of those candiates combined with just the last suspect Add-On you enabled to find the responsible pair of Add-Ons.\n\nA: The cause was indeed a specific add-on. In my case it was an add-on called MEGA which supported downloads from the MEGA cloud drive service. I suspect the reason is the change of the URL.\n\nA: At last!! My Firefox was back very quickly after I input this safemode command  \nfirefox -safe-mode\n\nBut after uninstalling completely a couple of addon (Agoogle applications tracker and flash downloaders)\nI checked my System Monitor and it was still running heavily (68%)\nI was still missing the icing on the cake\nThen I remembered this ¨amazing¨ startrek transporter animated persona that I wore from   yesterday, this one combine with the ugly add-on made firefox run at 100% and freeze. \n`\n\nBad Firefox Personas could slow your overall Operating System performance/speed \n\nNow I´am back to normal 10% system resource with both chromium and Firefox\n running at the same time.\n I´ĺl post the Firefox console error here:  \n\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 13.04, and I solved it after I uninstalled unity-webapps-facebookapps and unity-webapps-youtube.\n\nA: Same happened to me on with firefox 40.0\nThe whole window was grey after startup, even in safe mode, all the time.\nThe only thing which helped was pressing the (non-visible) reset and OK button after starting firefox in safe mode.\n\nA: I deduced it was the last extension I installed, duckduckgo.  As much as I love the search engine the extension was not working well with Firefox 56.02 for some reason.  Got rid of it and decided to just use it as my default search engine instead. :)\n", "Q: How can I change focus when a game locks it? I am playing Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, and when I play it in windowed mode, I can't change focus from the game to something else (Alt+Tab doesn't work).\n\nA: I had similar experience with Unreal Tournament 2004. Eventually I have found that pressing Esc (thus switching to game menu) released keyboard grab and I could alt-tab.\nUnfortunately, lot of games seem to not behave in a desktop-friendly fashion, exclusively grabbing keyboard and mouse during the action. This effectively disables any interaction of the user with the desktop: he can't use his window manager (alt-tab is the most common example), he can't use his desktop-wide keyboard shortcuts (e.g. control music player), he can't answer IM, etc.\nIt looks like there is no clean solution to this issue, except that redesigning affected games themselves. (Though some hacks with forbidding keyboard grabs using LD_PRELOAD may be relevant).\n\nA: You can try to assign a shortcut to a script like this: \n\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# by desgua\n#\n# To unmap a  windowed game\nxdotool search --class gedit windowunmap\nexit 0  \n\nchange gedit for the name of your game \nStep by step instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*We will need XDoTooland Compiz (You can install these from the software center or by clicking here)\n\n*Make a file .unmap.sh in your home folder.\n\n*Paste the script mentioned above into it:  \n\n*Make it executable (Here's how to do that).  \n\n*Open Compiz (Menu > System > Preferences > CompizConfig Manager)  \n\n*Go to Commands and add ~/.unmap.sh to one command   \n\n*Then go to Keybindings and make a shortcut for it.  \n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+X, where X is a number from 7 and up, will switch you to a different user's X session (if you have kernel modesetting, which is supported only by open-source drivers).\nFor example, I usually run ioquake3 in a different user account without compiz and autostarted apps and stuff. If I log in to my main user account first and then log in to my gaming account, I can switch to the main account from the game by pressing Ctrl+Alt+7 and back to the game by pressing Ctrl+Alt+8.\nThe main drawback in this method is that you'll have to enter your password each time you switch, regardless of any settings, and not all games survive this. Windows games are particularly naughty in these cases, even in Windows they tend to screw up the display and/or input if they lose focus.\n\nA: I haven't tried this with that specific game, but Ctrl+G frees up the mouse for a lot of games.\n\nA: I found one way, it works for Wolf:ET, it may help with other games too, if you turn on gameconsole (usually tilde key) game will release mouse lock (in windowed mode).\n", "Q: sqlite-ruby gem problem I am trying to get my ruby on rails up and running but i can't seem to install sqlite3-ruby gem .

You may need\n  configuration options.\n\nany solutions ?\n\nA: Okay, so I think I have to post something since I'm telling folks they are incorrect.  \nIn the case of sqlite-ruby libsqlite3-dev should do it.  \nTo be clear the ruby-full pseudo package only installs all of the \"components\" for an almost all option ruby installation.  It does absolutely nothing for dependency satisfaction for gems containing binary components.  \nTo find out what dev packages a gem requires you can occasionally check the gem's specfile or the page on rubyforge.  If it complains about a specific file not being found a little creative googling (the word provides often helps) should help you locate the -dev package that is required.  \nAnother useful site for this type of thing is ubuntu package search: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?mode=exactfilename&suite=intrepid&section=all&arch=any&searchon=contents&keywords=sqlite.h \nAnother point worth noting is that Ubuntu is siding with Debian on this one and trying to prebuild packages titled ruby-gemname or similar into aptitude to simplify package management and track gem changes.  This does break some of the requires in some ruby scripts.  I have quite the rant on that topic, but I digress.  \nIf you install libsqlite3-dev and it still doesn't work - ensure you are using the correct architecture gem (this is not necessarily automatic, maybe a future feature would be great gem developers).  \nIf you have that library installed and you are sure the architecture on the gem is correct, post what file it hangs on, and I'll see what I can dig up.\n\nA: Make sure you have sqlite3 v3.6.16 or greater installed. Gem needs 3.6.16 or greater to compile sqlite3-ruby.\nYou can check the version of your sqlite3 by first running which sqlite3 and then /path/to/sqlite3 -version.\n", "Q: Why can't clamdscan scan anything?

So either I'm missing something or there's a real problem here.\n\nUpdate 3\nI've submitted this as a bug report on Launchpad\n\nA: Elsewhere, I've seen that AppArmor or SELinux can cause problems for clamdscan. \nIf you run sudo aa-complain clamd and the re-scan works, that's probably your issue. (Be sure to re-enable it with sudo aa-enforce clamd.)\nTo temporarily disable SELinux, which I haven't run on Ubuntu, you can try \necho 0 > /selinux/enforce .    We can follow up with that if you're running SELinux.\nupdate: Here's a very interesting thread from launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/clamav/+bug/450250 .\nI would follow Jamie Strandboge's comments there to eliminate AppArmor profiles as the culprit.\n\nIf these aren't applicable the hack that springs to mind is piping a directory to standard output via tar, and feeding that into clamdscan (which is a variation on what you've mentioned for a single file).  I think that would look something like :  \n tar -cvf --to-stdout /somedirectory | clamdscan -  \n\n\nYou should be able to get the most recent packaged version of clamav from the Ubuntu Clamav team from their ppa : https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-clamav/+archive/ppa\nAlso, from the ClamAV site:  \"If you are going to submit a bug report, always check it against the latest development code .\"  (Assuming you haven't already done this) You'll have to pull that code manually from their Git repository and compile it. \nFor bug reporting on the Ubuntu packages, please see  http://askubuntu.com...how-do-i-report-a-bug  .\n=======\nOne thing to note, is that as far as I can tell, it is clamscan and not clamdscan which is supposed to just work unproblematically in your home directory.   \nUbuntu presents some possible complication (with the very desirable security increase) by having apparmor turned on by default. \n(clamdscan requires the clamav daemon to be running -- clamscan, more of an ad-hoc user-oriented package, does not.  With the additional features of clamdscan/clamd, there is added complexity overhead.)\nYet, against that, the bug for clamdscan and apparmor mentioned in the bug from this post should have been corrected by the time of the current package.   \n\nUpdated\nattempts to reproduce and resolve\nI don't think I can completely reproduce your environment or control for user error (definitely mine and possibly yours), however I've reproduced what I think is the same issue under the same version of clamav you have.  \nAdditionally, I've downloaded the latest code from the git repository, compiled and installed it, and still have the issue.   \nI don't have SELinux, but I do have AppArmor.   Have I correctly accounted for that?  I'm not 100%.    I still get the permission denied errors after turning off AppArmor though.  \n=======\n", "Q: Are there plans for handwriting recognition? This is a big feature when it comes to putting Ubuntu onto tablets. Currently, Netbook edition works great for that purpose and the pen digitiser is perfect, but the handwriting would be a real dealmaker (especially for my business - we could actually move to Linux) to compete with the Windows one.\nCellWriter exists, but that only handles character and keyboard input (but I don't know about multitouch on the keyboard). It also needs to handle print and cursive, because character mode can be slow and uncomfortable (unless you're writing passwords). Lastly, CellWriter needs to have some default letter shapes rather than having to be trained from the start.\nThere is a software package called MyScript (by Vision Objects) that handles all four modes (keyboard, character, print, cursive) plus calculator and fullscreen, but it's only free as a trial. Still, it would be nice to see it in the For Purchase section and the trial in the free section of the Software Centre.\nThe only other ones are for Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.\nWhat would really make a difference for us is the integration of some formal API with the OS that can automatically activate when running on a tablet to pass ink data to whatever recognition system is installed, and have something available (however rudimentary) to use it.\n\nA: Ubuntu keeps all it's plans in a system on launchpad called blueprints, each feature or plan is carefully laid out and given a time line. Searching this database I can find no release targeted specifications for handwriting. But I did find this user created specification back in Boston-UDS 2007:\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/handwriting-recognition\nPerhaps it's time for you and others to pick this up and beat the drum so Mark and the Platform team will take the lack of handwriting recognition as a problem that needs fixing in the next release.\nNow Ubuntu is based on Gnome, and checking Ubuntu functionality at this level wouldn't be complete without looking for gnome solutions. For that I come across this project called CellWriter:\nhttp://risujin.org/cellwriter/\nGnome plans are not firm on the matter of hand reorganisation, so it's not likely we'll get leadership in putting the functionality into Gnome by default. My best advice would be to try CellWriter, if it does the job then push for it's inclusion by default by creating or modifying the blueprint and keeping at the issue through the release cycle.\n", "Q: What is the impact of the nolapic parameter on a multiprocessor laptop? I have an Asus X71SL with an Intel Dual Core T3200 processor. Any kernel version after 2.6.35-rc2 won't boot up on my machine without the nolapic kernel parameter at bootup. I have already reported this as a bug, but this is the only thing keeping me from updating to 10.10 or 11.04 when it'll be released. \nShould I just use the nolapic parameter as a default and move on (and in the meantime try to resolve the bug) or is there a big performance/other trade-off?\n\nA: I don't think there are any limitations under that mode. All It will do Is make one of your processors work, not all of them. Basically, with nolapic it just uses one processor than the number installed.\n\nA: My machine is an Asus F50SF and the following helped:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your BIOS settings\n\n*Navigate to Security > I/O Interface security\n\n*Change New interface card to LOCKED and save the settings.\n\n\nVoilá!

Mark Shuttleworth recently blogged about the decision to include the Qt libraries in the 11.10 release, with a followup from Jono Bacon.

Or, alternatively:\nWhat is the closest I can get to this?\n\nIf my laptop ever gets stolen, I want it to do everything in its power to phone home. Prey only kicks in after an internet connection has been established, and I don't trust a thief to figure out how to connect to wireless networks in a foreign operating system.\n\nA: First thing probably would be to make sure that wifi was enabled and up at boot then drop a bash script into the start-up programs that will search for and attempt to connect to avaliable networks. I haven't been able to find one that does that \"specifically\" but I found this Bash script for wireless which will output a list of available essid's if you then loop through those with this\n    ifconfig wlan0\n    iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_ID key WIRELESS_KEY\n    dhclient wlan0\n\nmight take a bit of \"bashing\" to get it to work smoothly and you might want it to repeat the operation every few minutes. Plus it would be good to have the ability to switch on and off the script depending on whether you are traveling or not.\nHope this gives you some idea's. \n\nA: If your laptop has an internal PCI or even a spare PCMIA slot, I would go with a nice little 3G modem, preferably one that can do estimated-GPS.\nThe extra hardware means you can not only practically guarantee a connection for lockdown and evidence collection, but you can get a location.\nThen on boot (via a little upstart script) have it dial out to a server of yours looking for a stolen file. If the remote file says it's stolen the script would then get its GPS, take pictures with the webcam and upload all that to my server. And then it would lock down my personal files. And then perhaps start a double-tunnelled SSH session to my desktop so I could interactively manage it.\nThe cool thing is, I dont think this would be that expensive or hard to manage.

I doubt\n  this solution is still valid]\n  \n*Lock the installed version in Synaptic\n  \n*Install pavucontrol in Synaptic\n  \n*Open the program with padsp xvidcap\n  \n*Click on the recording button (red circle)\n  \n*Run pavucontrol, go to the Recording tab and there choose Monitor of Analog Stereo Internal Audio\n  \n  \n  Done!!\nTo record with sound, the program has always to be run with padsp\n  xvidcap (for example from ALT+F2). To run it always like that from\n  the menu: run alacarte, go to Sound and video, then to XVidCap\n  Screen Capture > Properties and where it says Command put padsp\n  xvidcap.\n\nI would add this:\nThe above is to record system sound, that is, whatever is coming out of the speakers, which can be of a song or movie of our hard drive or pendrive played by Totem, of a Flash music video of a website played by Firefox.\nNevertheless, sometimes it can be necessary to record the microphone sound, for example if we want to make a video tutorial to explain how a program works. In this case we put xvidcap in recording state, run pavucontrol and in the Recording tab we put Analog Stereo Internal Audio (without \"Monitor of\").\nIf we only want to record sound (without video) we can run from ALT+F2 gnome-sound-recorder. The first time probably it will be configured to record from the microphone. To record the system sound we run with ALT+F2 gnome-volume-control, go to the Hardware tab and in Profile we put Analog Stereo Output (it's also possible to do this running pavucontrol and using the Configuration tab).\nBut when we finish we have to put again Analog Stereo Duplex in the Profile of Hardware of gnome-volume-control (or of Configuration of pavucontrol), so we can still choose the origin of the sound when recording with xvidcap.\nNB: sometimes, to change from Analog Stereo Duplex to Analog Stereo Output it may be necessary to change first to Off, close, open again and then change finally to Analog Stereo Output. The same for the opposite change. If not, the computer may \"not notice\" that we have applied the change.\nTaken from this post on Ubuntu Forums\n\nA: You need pavucontrol - from here, you can set Xvidcap to record from your internal audio.\n\nTo get XVidCap to be detected, you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*first record a dummy video (I know, an annoying extra step)\n\n*find XVidCap in pavucontrol, change it to record from the internal audio\n\n*Stop recording in XVidCap, delete the dummy video\n\n*Now record as normal\n\n*You will not need to do this again if you keep your system on hibernate/sleep instead of restarting, but pulseaudio will not remember your settings if you restart your system.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work, try recording the audio in the background with gnome-sound-recorder, and then adding it to your video using Kdenlive, Pitivi, or Openshot.\n\nA: For 64 bits: angel-de-vicente.blogspot.com/2011/03/screencasts-with-xvidcap-in-ubuntu-1004.html :\nIn order to install it in my x86_64 system I just have to use the --force-architecture option to the dpkg -i command.\nangelv@vaso:~/Desktop$ sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i xvidcap_1.1.7jaunty_i386.deb \nBut when trying to run it I see that there are some i386 libraries missing. In order to easily install them I use the getlibs script.\nangelv@vaso:~/Desktop$ padsp xvidcap\nxvidcap: error while loading shared libraries: libtheora.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nangelv@vaso:~/Desktop$ getlibs /usr/bin/xvidcap\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nAbout getlibs: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474790\n\nA: After a video is recorded xvidcap offers to play it immediately. But if you click on the \"Play\" button the video is not reproduced.\nThis problem happens at least in Ubuntu 10.04 because by default it doesn't have installed mplayer, the program that xvidcap uses to play the videos when pressing on the stated button.\nThere are 2 solutions:\na) Install mplayer from Synaptic.\nor\nb) Go to preferences (right clicking on the name of the file, for example test-0000.mpeg, and then cliking on Preferences), then to the Commands tab, and then in the \"Multi-Frame Capture Commands\"' \"Playback Command\" replace mplayer with totem and click on OK. Then right click again on the name of the file and click on \"Save preferences\".\n\nA: I struggled with this on 64bit Ubuntu - The downloads offer only i386 architecture, and I wasn't keen to force the architecture.\nIt's relatively simple to compile the offered source, and that also works with the padsp wrapper as per Friendien's answer.\nDownload the xvidcap-1.1.7.tar.gz file from the Sourceforge project above.\nExtract the file (tar -xzf) then cd into the folder and run ./configure.\nAt this point you may have to install some extra software - I installed glade (for libglade2.0) and libxmu-dev.\nOnce configure has run, do\nmake\n\nThen \nsudo make install\n\nRun it (as suggested) with \npadsp xvidcap\n\nand it's all good to go (for me, Ubuntu 11.04 64bit).\n\nA: Another option, not to have to change once and again between Analog Stereo Duplex and Analog Stereo Output neither limit the sound source for xvidcap, is to leave Analog Stereo Duplex and use also pavucontrol when we want to change the source of the sound for gnome-sound-recorder. Like the stated for padsp xvidcap, to change where we want to record the sound from, we put gnome-sound-recorder recording, open pavucontrol and in the Recording tab we put the desired option. In this case there is no need to use padsp (xvidcap needs it because it was designed for OSS. What padsp does is to connect OSS with PulseAudio, as shown in http://linux.die.net/man/1/padsp ).\n\nA: You can install Audio Recorder to record audio from the microphone or from the system: https://launchpad.net/~osmoma/+archive/audio-recorder\n", "Q: Will 11.04 ship with Nautilus 3?

According to this answer, .local .cache and .config are, by convention, configuration storage locations adopted by Gnome and Ubuntu.  \nAre .gnome .gnome2 and .gconf therefore legacy configuration directories, or are they supposed to co-exist?\nAnd does the adoption of dconf alter these dot-file application config conventions?\nFinally, what is the relation of the gconf-editor data settings to these directories?  Do .gnome/.gconf contain the same info that gconf-editor accesses? \nUpdates: \nXDG has been pointed to as the reason for .cache, .local, and .config.  \nThis question on dconf advises that dconf will be the replacement for gconf,\nas documented on Gnome.org . \nFurthermore,  João says that dconf is the\n\nGNOME technology used to store\n  application settings. [...] dconf is\n  the GNOME3 replacement for gconf which\n  has not been maintained for some time.\n  dconf is also expected to bring\n  performance improvements over gconf\n  (relevant for applications startup).\n\nI expect, based on that that there will be a somewhat anarchic migration path from gconf settings to dconf.  I would love to hear any additional perspectives.\n\nA: The proper phrasing should be that .local, .cache, etc are part of the XDG Base Directory Specification of FreeDesktop, http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html.\nThe XDG Base Directory Specification is a standard, and is followed by KDE and other compliant environments. \n\nA: .local, .cache, and .config are part of the FreeDesktop Base Directory Specification. They should not actually be hard-coded but instead use the environment variables (i.e. $XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CACHE_HOME, and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME). There are GLib and Python wrappers for the spec that may be helpful as well. Here's an example in Python:\n>>> import xdg.BaseDirectory\n>>> print xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_data_home\n/home/andrew/.local/share\n>>> print xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_config_home\n/home/andrew/.config\n>>> print xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_cache_home\n/home/andrew/.cache\n\n.gnome and .gnome2 are indeed deprecated and should not be used. These were used by libgnome's gnome-config module.\n.gconf does indeed contain the settings that gconf-editor accesses as xml files.

If a file is open for reading (say, by a shared library with its contents loaded in memory), you really don't want those contents over-written unexpectedly.  So, I believe the normal way (ie when data=ordered) is to write the data to disk, update the inodes/metadata, point the directory entry to the new file, but leave the old file in-place and allocated until all references to it are removed (that is, all processes have released any file_open handles).\nIn that case, shred/wipe might force an fsync, but the old file is still very much active which means it won't get shredded.\n\nA: Ext[234] always does update in place.

These will make the configuation easier.\nsudo apt-get instapp padevchooser pavucontrol pulseaudio\nNext run padevchooser from a terminal or Applications > Sound & Video > PulseAudio Device Chooser\nThis will load a small application to your system tray area near your clock which enables you to quickly configure and control pulseaudio.  The first thing you need to do is configure the machine you was to recieve sound to advertise it's devices over the network then the sending device needs to be configured to add discoaverabe devices to the local sound server.\nWith that done and the remote devices showing up on the sending machine first use the device chooser icon to open the volume control from the menu.  Next start skype and have it begin playing audio, starting the Skype Test Call will work for this when it does you will see skype appear in the list on the playback tab.  Next to it above the meter bars on the right will be a drop down box showing the device selected for the audio to be played here you can select the remote vevice you would like the sound to be sent to.\n", "Q: How to configure xvfb?

After that, I unmounted and mounted back my USB. Then GParted -> Devices -> /dev/sdb on my case, and then Partition -> Format to -> fat32.

I have changed ownership of my localhost file on /var/www/ and its sub folders and given it permission 777. However, whenever I add a new folder in it the new folder does not automatically get that permission. How can I give a folder 777 permission forever so that if I add a new folder or file it gets the same permission?\n\nA: You should edit /etc/apache/envvars as root with your editor of choice.\nExample: ALT+F2\ngksudo gedit /etc/apache2/envvars\nGo to the end of the file and add a line umask XXX.\nWhere umask is the binary opposite of the desired permissions value.\nFor 774 this would be 003.  For 777 bad idea it would be 000.\nSave.\nRestart apache.\nExample: sudo apache2ctl restart\nThis will only affect files/folders that are newly created by the apache user.\nAdditional note, read and write is 6 in the user, group, or anyone slot.\n\nA: You can use the recursive option any time.\nsudo chown -R username /var/www\n\nA: As others have already mentioned, giving 777 permissions on /var/www is a really bad idea, especially in production.\nA better solution would be to give write permissions only to the users who needs to modify the files. One of the ways to do that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new group\n\n*add the user(s) who needs to modify the data in /var/www to that group\n\n*recursively change the ownership of /var/www to that group\n\n*set umask on /var/www so all newly created files are owned by the group we've created.\nAnother option would be to use ACL, again, to give write permissions only to users who need them.\nHere are detailed instructions on serverfault.\nGenerally, the webserver or other network services or system user accounts should have no write permissions to the files served by the webserver, as this opens a possibility of arbitrary code execution.  \n\nA: Permissions for newly created files are set by umask\n\nA: Also, some \"out of the box\" solution is to configure your http server to use different folder. If You use Apache, simply edit it config files. This way You do not have to change permissions for /var/www witch can be bad idea (potential security issues).\nAnd umask is answer for Your question. It can be used to restrict default privileges for newly created folders and files. And distribution developers tend to use it to restrict access to some system folders.\n\nA: I think you want to have write access to /var/www to modify files and dirs. I think the best solution is to install apache2-mpm-itk and in the virtual host config file add /etc/apache2/sites-available/default:\n<IfModule mpm_itk_module>\n    AssignUserId your-username your-group\n</IfModule>\n\nand run chown your-username\\: /var/www -Rv this way apache for that virtual host will run with your UID/GID and you will be able to edit files. Even files created by PHP will have your UID/GID\n", "Q: Gnome doesn't start after libdbus update Yesterday I updated dbus library via apt-get.

One way to use it is to link the command to a keyboard shortcut; then, any time you press the key, a new tab will open automatically.\nI took this approach because frequently I'm looking not only for the translation but also for the pronunciation as well.\nIn addition, you might want to check translate-shell out, it is a command-line utility that interfaces with many translation engines.\n\nA: Setting up and configuring the 'translate highlighted text' script\n\n\n*\n\n*To be able to use the script, firstly install libnotify-bin (so the script can send desktop notifications), wget (to retrieve the translation from Google) and xsel (which is used to get the currently highlighted text). In Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc. install them using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install libnotify-bin wget xsel  \n\n\n*Next, copy the script code below:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  \nnotify-send --icon=info \"$(xsel -o)\" \"$(wget -U \"Mozilla/5.0\" -qO - \"http://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=auto&**tl=en**&dt=t&q=$(xsel -o | sed \"s/[\\\"'<>]//g\")\" | sed \"s/,,,0]],,.*//g\" | awk -F'\"' '{print $2, $6}')\"  \n\nand paste it in a new file - let's call it notitrans (well, you can call it whatever you want, but that's how I'll refer to it from now on).\nIn the script above, replace tl=en with the language into which you want the text to be translated, for instance tl=ru for Russian, tl=fr for French and so on.\nAfter you're done, save the file in your home directory and make it executable using the following command:\nchmod +x ~/notitrans\n\n\n*Place the script in your $PATH - for instance, to copy the script to /usr/local/bin/, use the following command:\nsudo mv ~/notitrans /usr/local/bin/\n\n\n*To be able to use the script, you can assign it a custom keyboard shortcut. Doing this depends on your desktop environment. \nOn GNOME (and Unity), you can do this by going to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts, where you'll need to click \"+\" to add a new keyboard shortcut. Here, enter any name you want for the new custom shortcut and \"notitrans\" as the command:\n\nAnd finally, assign a keyboard shortcut to the newly added command by clicking on it and then holding down the keys you want to assign to it. Make sure the keyboard shortcut is not already in use!\nOptional: variations of the 'translate highlighted text' script\n\nDisplay the translation with Zenity (which allows the text to be copied) instead of using desktop notifications:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash  \ntext=\"$(xsel -o)\"  \ntranslate=\"$(wget -U \"Mozilla/5.0\" -qO - \"http://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=auto&**tl=en**&dt=t&q=$(echo $text | sed \"s/[\\\"'<>]//g\")\" | sed \"s/,,,0]],,.*//g\" | awk -F'\"' '{print $2, $6}')\"   \necho -e \"Original text:\" \"$text\"'\\n' > /tmp/notitrans  \necho \"Translation:\" \"$translate\" >> /tmp/notitrans  \nzenity --text-info --title=\"Translation\" --filename=/tmp/notitrans \n\nFor this to work, make sure Zenity is installed on your system. On Ubuntu, install it using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install zenity\n\nDisplay the translation in a desktop notification AND automatically copy the translation to the clipboard:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ntext=\"$(xsel -o)\"\ntranslate=\"$(wget -U \"Mozilla/5.0\" -qO - \"http://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=auto&**tl=en**&dt=t&q=$(echo $text | sed \"s/[\\\"'<>]//g\")\" | sed \"s/,,,0]],,.*//g\" | awk -F'\"' '{print $2, $6}')\"  \necho \"$translate\" | xclip -selection clipboard  \nnotify-send --icon=info \"$text\" \"$translate\"  \n\nFor this to work, make sure xclip is installed on your system. On Ubuntu, install it using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\n\nA: Google Desktop Translator is a Java application that runs on Ubuntu if Java was installed. The file you downloaded obviously is designed to install and uncompress from Windows or (see Javier Rivera's comment) may be another third party Windows program. Both will not work in Ubuntu.\nDownload the appropriate .zip file directly from Google with this link:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-translate-desktop/downloads/list\nUncompress the files, open a terminal, cd to your installation directory and run\njava -jar google-translate-desktop-0.52.jar\nThe program window should now open:\n\nUnfortunately in version 0.52 this window has no decoration and cannot be moved, but there is full translation functionality. For quitting or for program settings a status icon is generated in the GNOME panel. Windows decoration is present in the beta version only that has a slightly reduced functionality.\nIf you're not experienced on your Ubuntu or feel uncomfortable to install anything from external sources you may consider to use Google's Web-frontend for translation instead.\n\nA: You tried to run a Windows program. Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure all the files and subdirectories from the ZIP archive are in a folder.\n\n*While in that folder, right-click on google-translate-desktop-x.y.jar, and click Properties, then Permissions.\n\n*Make sure \"Allow executing file as program\" is checked.\n\n*Close the dialog, right-click on the file, and under Open With, click your Java Runtime.\n\n\nEDIT: You may have downloaded windows only freeware.

When I fire up remote desktop on Windows and connect to my server (Windows Server 2008), the fonts look pretty smooth.  I just installed Ubuntu 10.10 yesterday and when I use rdesktop to connect the fonts look terrible.  \nI've looked at all the settings but had no luck.  Maybe there's some secret switch, or do I need to use a different client?\n\nA: Using remmina one can also enable font smoothing. \nTL;DR : Choose the Best (slowest) \"Quality\" setting in the Advanced Tab when editing the RDP connection.\nLonger answer:\nWhen editing an RDP connection, there is a \"Quality\" setting under the Advanced tab. It can have one of the values Poor, Medium, Good or Best. Under Prefrences/RDP one can configure properties for each of these Quality settings like this:\n\nBy default only Best has \"Font smoothing\" enabled, so choose Best or configure the Quality setting you want to use to include Font smoothing.\n(Testing using remmina version 1.2.0-rcgit-26 (git rcgit-26) from a ppa on Ubuntu 14.04)\n\nA: Use one of the following experience options:\nrdesktop -x 0x8F mywinserver   # modem default + font smoothing\nrdesktop -x 0x81 mywinserver   # broadband default + font smoothing\nrdesktop -x 0x80 mywinserver   # LAN default + font smoothing\n\nFrom http://katastrophos.net/andre/blog/2008/03/10/rdesktop-connect-to-windows-vista-with-cleartype-font-smoothing-enabled/\nFonts will be better\n\nA: Perhaps not completely helpful, since Wishi has already suggested it, but for the record, there's no reason that Remmina should be displaying \"terrible\" fonts.  You won't get Cleartype, sure, but they should still be slick and readable.\nHere's a screenshot from my Windows 2003 box :\n\nThat's running 16-bit colour, though.  In order to try that, go to the settings page in Remmina and change it from 256 colours to 16-bit :\n\n\nA: Use the latest freerdp and give it the parameter -x 80. This is the user experience flag which enables everything that freerdp supports, so it should be identical to being directly on the box. (or at least it is for windows7).\nThese flags are documented by Microsoft here:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240476\nI still have to enable font smoothing each time I reconnect to my windows 7 box and haven't found a way around that yet.\nedit: xfreerdp flags kan be read here http://linux.die.net/man/1/xfreerdp\n\nA: My guess is that you want to check out remmina (http://remmina.sourceforge.net/) which has quality options for RDP 5.

While making screencasts I always end up with a file having poorly synced audio and video streams. This is not container specific as this happens with all the formats - ogg, mkv, avi, mp4 etc. I guess this has something to do with ffmpeg. \nAfter searching on Internet, I found that this can be fixed using itsoffset switch in ffmpeg. I also tested it and it works. But the question is how do I find exact lag between audio and video streams in seconds:milliseconds?? I tried ffmpeg -i but it always shows delay to be zero.\n\nA: Do you know what a clapper is? It's an old device used in movie making and looks like this:\n\nThis is used by the editor to sync the video and audio together. You need this because there is nothing about audio and video streams that really allow a computer to work out how out of sync they are.\nYour best course of action is to work out why your recording is going out of sync. It sounds like your computer might be underpowered (conjecture as I don't know how powerful your computer is). If you can't solve the syncing problem, then use a clapper (or make one) and then trial and error your way into syncing it back up.\nOf course this only helps with fixed sync issues, if you have progressive sync issues then you can use the time signature to resync the streams and this is something the computer can help you with. Is suspect that's what ffmpeg is trying to do.\n", "Q: Better alt+tab for Gnome? Is there any Alt+Tab module for gnome that make it behave more like it is in Windows 7?\nEdit: By how it behaves more like Windows 7, I mean when you press Alt+Tab you can also, when you have those keys pressed in, navigate through the windows with the arrow keys\n\nA: You can customise window switching using CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) .\nIf you launch CCSM, you will find the relevant options (highlighted) in the 'Window Management' section. The 'Switcher' options are all a variation on the traditional Alt+Tab behaviour but they are much more customisable and you can use any keyboard shortcut you want.\n\nYou can enable them by ticking the checkbox next to the option. Click on the option to configure it. To get Alt+Tab behaviour you need to set the keyboard shortcut for the 'Next Window' action to Alt+Tab.\n\nTo set the keyboard shortcut, click the button to the right of 'Next Window' and follow the dialog to grab the key combination that can be Alt+Tab, Super+Tab or any other combination you prefer.\n\nYou may use any number of these window switchers but you must use different keyboard shortcuts so that they don't conflict.\nAs for:\n\nmake it behave more like it is in Windows 7\n\nI have never used this operating system so I don't know how it behaves. I assume it is a window switcher with eye candy - this is what these Compiz Plugins provide.\nNote: you need to run Compiz (desktop effects) for this solution to work. This requires the appropriate drivers and a sufficient graphics card to work.\n\nA: With Compiz (the the well known window manager with composition), you may use any key/mouse combination (not only alt-tab> to switch between windows (there are many plugins included with Compiz that may change the behavior).\nTo install Compiz (supposing that your video card is compiz-capable):\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager\nOnce installed, goto \"System\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\", and start playing with it!\n\nA: I think that\n\nbehave like Windows7\n\nmeans to allow browsing through available windows (after Alt+Tab is pressed) using arrow-keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, mouse etc.\nI have tried to solve this but the only compiz module (compiz=window manager in Gnome) which supports this feature is the shift switcher (maybe ring switcher supports it to). \nIt seems that the traditional window switchers (flat overview of windows composed in a table, without animations) such as Static App. Switcher or App. Switcher don't support this behavior. \nTo set up those switchers in Gnome (compiz), use CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) (might be necessary to install it). For details about CCSM see the answer of dv3500ea.\nOn the other hand, you could try kde4 which supports this feature.\nOr you can use Gnome-Shell  which also supports this app-switching behavior.\n\nA: I'm not a fan of compiz, so I have another solution that has worked fine for me for years.\nIt's a little app called \"Super Switcher\".\nMake sure you get the .6 version, errors will occur on the .5 version.\nIt works great on laptops. All you have to do is hold the Super down and ← or →. To move a window between desktops, Shift + Super + ← or →. \nSo easy.\n\nA: I searched and searched for an answer to a similar question and wasn't satisfied with anything I found until I came across this on this blog.  Simply execute these commands in a shell:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications \"[]\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications-backward \"[]\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows \"['<Alt>Tab', '<Super>Tab']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows-backward  \"['<Alt><Shift>Tab', '<Super><Shift>Tab']\"\n\nThe result is that you will be able to switch between all windows (including those from the same app) with alt+tab (and alt+shift+tab) much like in Windows.\n\nA: Try compiz-settings-manager... there you have some options to chage between windows.... don't know if you'll think it behaves like Windows 7, but give it a try and customize it to your like.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 11.04 work on my old pc? It has an old SiS based graphics chip with 64mb memory, there were never 3D drivers for them. Ubuntu 10.10 doesn't even boot on it and my laptop, a Lenovo N200 with intel 9something graphics 128mb so I'm really worried. Broadband prices don;t come cheap in South Africa so the download has to be worth it. I can wait for the shipment but I've since orderd 10.10 and it hasn't come, so I don't know if I'm barred from using that service since I've been sent a disc every release. \n\nA: You should mention your system configuration in little more detail. Anyways the minimum system requirements for running Ubuntu (from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements) are\n\n\n*\n\n*1 GHZ processor\n\n*1 GB RAM\n\n*15 GB Harddisk space\n\n*Graphics card and monitor capable of 1024 by 768\n\n\nBased on the specs for your laptop, that I found on internet, it is well above the minimum requirements. So you should have no problem running Ubuntu 10.10 or Ubuntu 11.04 on it. If you cant boot Ubuntu using live CD on your laptop then it is some other problem and you can ask question about it here.\nIn my experience Ubuntu runs easily on machines with lot less capable hardware. I ran Ubuntu 9.10 on a Pentium 3 with 384 MB of RAM but XUbuntu ran a lot better on that machine. So for your old PC I would suggest you install XUbuntu. Its UBuntu with different Desktop Environment i.e XFCE which is a lot lightweight than GNOME or KDE. From the same webpage I mentioned above the minimum hardware requirements for XUbuntu are\n\n\n*\n\n*256 MB Memory\n\n*2 GB of disk space\n\n*Graphic card and monitor capable of 800 x 600 resolution\n\n\nAs you can see this is not much to ask for. \nGood Luck\n\nA: Yes - it ought to run. \nHowever - you may have some issues running the graphical install. If you can still download it (haven't checked) get the alternative text based installer CD. It's much easier to fix video issues with a full system - than it is during a broken install process.\n\nA: Just as a point I have been trying the same setup and had the flashing graphics issue as Steve mentioned above.\nWhen logging in switch to Ubuntu Classic (No Effects)\nThis seems to solve the issue.\n\nA: I have been installing Ubuntu on older PC's for a few years.  I find there is a difference between what you need to install versus what you need for a satisfying user experience.  For example, I installed Hardy Heron on an old Pentium III box, with 512 MB of RAM, and 64 MB onboard graphics. It seemed like it was strong enough but, While there wasn't any problems installing from the CD I burned from a downloaded ISO file, running it was a different story.  It would frequently hang, especially with OPEN OFFICE word processor (30 page project) and Firefox browser open (I think had 4 tabs open) at the same time.  Could this be an issue of not having enough RAM?  It very well could be, but system monitor showed only about 75% of RAM being used at the time.  I was working on a research paper at the time, and lost quite a bit of work because the only thing I could do was restart.  So my point here is, you need to provide the hardware environment that Ubuntu will run well in, not just focus on what you need to install.  I'm thinking that for Ubuntu 10 you need a Pentium 4 at LEAST 1.8GHz, with at least 1024MB of RAM and an Nvidia Geforce MX series at least.  Also, please use a HD at least 40GB; while smaller drives will work, I would worry about running out of space, which from Windows experience can be devastating.  Ive had better luck incidentally, with Intel System boards and chipsets than other makes.\nI am all for finding ways to keep using older computers.  I have never liked the idea of throwing something like a computer away simply because it's considered obsolete.  I think there are a lot of users who really do need more power, but there are a lot of other people who only have basic needs which are easily met by an older computer, but they can't afford to buy a new system.  Meanwhile, I've seen piles of old computers 12 feet high that will be scrapped, and there are people who don't have anything to use; I think it's an obscene example of waste.\n\nA: Have a look at this. You will be able to run Ubuntu on 64 MB RAM with a window manager. \nYou could try LXDE instead of IceWM if you want a prettier computer. Take a look at this if you do, it will show you how to do it.\n\nA: It is doubtful that you will get hardware acceleration for your graphics card.\nHowever, not all are lost. You can use Unity 2D, which does not require 3D acceleration.\nAs far as I understand, Unity 2D will be available as a fallback if a computer does not support 3D acceleration.\nRead more about Unity 2D (+video).\n\nA: You may want to try Lubuntu, which needs as minimum 96 MB of RAM.\n", "Q: .bash_login not executing I've put a .bash_login file in my $HOME-directory but it doesn't execute.

When it is executed as interactive non-login shell it reads .bashrc. Commonly it is the second case i.e when you run gnome-terminal bash is run as non-login shell. Applications->Accessories->Terminal is a menu entry for gnome-terminal.\n", "Q: \"$MAKEOPTS\" ignored, why? I have defined \nexport MAKEOPTS=\"-j4\"\n\nin my ~/.profile file.\nBut when I do a compilation with make, this option is ignored.\nI've consulted the GNU Make manual but it says nothing about this variable. Is it standard or only it works in certain distros? \n\nA: export MAKE=\"make -j4\"\n\nThis will help invoking child make processes, but I'm afraid this wouldn't help with direct invocations, like just make all. Though a shell alias may help with the direct ones, so:\nMAKEFLAGS=\"-j4\"\nexport MAKE=\"make $MAKEFLAGS\"\nalias make=\"make $MAKEFLAGS\"\n\n\nA: I'll be honest, before today I'd never seen MAKEOPTS.\nMAKEFLAGS I know of but after some research, MAKEOPTS appears to be Gentoo- (and its children) specific.\nAnd if it's not in the manual, it can hardly be considered standard by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nA: Add\nMAKEOPTS=\"-j4\"\n\nto /etc/make.conf (create it if it doesn't already exist).\n", "Q: How to change Gnome-Terminal title? I have several instances of terminals running in my working environment, what I would like is to set a specific title for each one, in order to have a clear idea what purpose the specific terminal serves i.e. Apache, editing_ini, postgres etc...\nOf course from the command line.\n\nA: Ward's answer is great if you want to set your title based on what host you're on etc every time you open a terminal. If you just want to quickly set a title though, you can just run echo by itself:\necho -ne \"\\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\\007\"\n\nor make a simple function (inside your ~/.bashrc), say termtitle\ntermtitle() { printf \"\\033]0;$*\\007\"; }\n\nwhich you can run with termtitle some title here.\n\nA: If you use the Vim editor, you can also enable this option in your vimrc:\n:set title\n\nwhich is disabled by default. It will set cool terminal titles showing the filename which you are editing at the moment and some other things.\n\nA: Argh, so many answers...\nI tried wmctrl, which almost worked, except I couldn't get it to change the icon title, at least not permanently.\nThe problem is that the PS1 in Bash in Ubuntu sets the title.\nThe default PS1 is\n\\[\\e]0;\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ \n\n... which sets the title in the first escape sequence: \\e]0;\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\nThus, there are two solutions:\nSolution 1: simplify PS1, then use PROMPT_COMMAND\nChange PS1 to something simpler:\nPS1=\"\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ \"\n\nThen use the PROMPT_COMMAND:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\\007\"'\n\nSolution 2: directly modify PS1\nSimply modify PS1 with new title:\nPS1='\\[\\e]0;newtitle\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nNotes on escape codes\nNote that (borrowing from wjandrea's comment below this answer):\n\n*\n\n*\\e or \\033 is the escape (ESC) character, which starts an escape sequence.\n\n*] starts an operating system command (OSC).\n\n*For an xterm, 0; means \"set the title\", and\n\n*\\a or \\007 is the bell (BEL) character that terminates the OSC.\n\nMore info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Escape_sequences\n\nA: Another way of changing the title of gnome-terminal is by using gconftool-2; this changes the initial terminal title for the profile selected, so you could have different profiles associated with titles such as 'Apache', 'Editing', etc. You would then launch gnome-terminal with the appropriate profile to get the terminal title you had specified. This is in contrast to gnome-terminal --title \"name\" which changes the title per terminal, but doesn't affect the initial title specified in the profile.\nYou could use the following command in a script to set the name of the terminal for a profile, and you could have the name of the terminal change at certain times in the day to remind you of things:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/title --type=string \"Apache\"\n\nThis is for the default profile, but you could set the title for other profiles as well by changing, for example, Default to another profile like Profile0:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Profile0/title --type=string \"Editing\"\n\nI thought this way of changing the title is of use because of the way it could be used in scripting, or just as a quick command-line way to set the title for the profile. Note that sometimes you have to relaunch the terminal with the specified profile for the gconftool-2 setting to take affect. The complete settings available for gnome-terminal can be listed with gconftool-2 -R /apps/gnome-terminal.\n\nA: To display only the current working directory in the title, try this in your '.bashrc' :\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0; ${PWD##*/}\\007\"'\n\nor\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;$(basename ${PWD})\\007\"' \n\n\nA: Another solution is to use xdotool to simulate keystrokes, maybe useful in scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a keyboard shortcut in gnome-terminal:\nEdit > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Terminal > Set Title\n\nFor example assing the Shift+Ctrl+Y.\n\n*Install xdotool if you don't have it already:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*The following sequence of commands (that you can use also in a bash script) will set the terminal/tab title (escape the spaces with \\):\nxdotool key ctrl+shift+y \nxdotool type My\\ new\\ fabulous\\ title\nxdotool key Return\n\n\n*[optional] You can also use xdotool to e.g. open a new tab and set the title with the above commands, using:\nxdotool key ctrl+shift+t\n\nConsider adding a sleep time before and after opening a new tab, e.g. sleep 1 (to wait for 1 second).\nThis is not the most elegant solution, but it worked for me! The previous answers did not work in my case. I use gnome-terminal in Ubuntu 14.04 and I wanted to make a bash script.\n\nA: For the sake of completeness, I would add that you can also set the gnome-terminal title using this command: \nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -N \"MyWindowTitle\"\n\nYou'll need to install the package wmctrl  first.\n\nA: Works on Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04\nThis answer is simpler than most others. To use it, you would just type:\ntitle \"My new title\"\n\n*\n\n*Easier to remember than most other answers.\n\n*The accepted answer and others do not work on modern versions of Ubuntu (from 16.04 on up).\n\n*This answer doesn't require 3rd party packages like wmctrl and xdotool.\n\n*Version 2 allows running multiple times in the same session.\n\n\nOne-time function creation\nCreate the title function in your ~/.bashrc file:\nfunction title() {\n    # Set terminal tab title. Usage: title \"new tab name\"\n    prefix=${PS1%%\\\\a*}                  # Everything before: \\a\n    search=${prefix##*;}                 # Eeverything after: ;\n    esearch=\"${search//\\\\/\\\\\\\\}\"         # Change \\ to \\\\ in old title\n    PS1=\"${PS1/$esearch/$@}\"             # Search and replace old with new\n}\n\nSave the ~/.bashrc file. After opening a new terminal tab use:\ntitle \"Special Projects\"\n\nor:\ntitle Special\\ Projects\n\nA phrase with spaces must be wrapped in double quotes (\") or each space must be escaped with \\.\n\nA: This worked in my Gnome Terminal 3.18.3.\nEdit your .bashrc file and add this function\n# Update gnome terminal title\nfunction termtitle() {\n    # take argument\n    TITLE=$1\n    shift\n    # update title\n    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0; $TITLE \\007\"'\n}\n\nDon't forget to source your .bashrc file\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n\nAnd then you can simply update you'll be able to change terminal title like this:\n$ termtitle \"MariaDB CLI\"\n\n\nA: Alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are other ways however, you can also issue\ngnome-terminal --title=\"SOME TITLE HERE\"\n\nThis might not give the desired effect since there is a big chance that your .bashrc overwrites that behaviour.\n\n*Bringing us to the last method, which I shamelessly ripped out of my .bashrc.\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\\007\"'\n\nAs an extra reference, this is the particular line in my .bashrc\nPROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \"\\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD/$HOME/~}\\007\"'\n\nYou may also need to comment this code out in your ~/.bashrc\ncase \"$TERM\" in\nxterm*|rxvt*)\n    # JEFFYEE REMOVED because it makes commands to title() not work\n    #PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n    ;;\n*)\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: If you are a Ubuntu user, you can change the title of a gnome-terminal tab using the HUD.\nWhile in the gnome-terminal, hit Alt to bring up the HUD, type the first few letters, e.g. \"tit\", hit enter and type in your new title.\nThis is a very quick method and avoids using the mouse.\n(UPDATE: In newer versions of gnome-terminal, this was removed.

I initially only setup eth0 and added the eth1 card when I needed it.  eth0 was working find until I added eth1, now, can't get any connectivity on eth0 unless I pull eth1 out of the box.  The configuration on each system is as follows:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n      address 192.168.200.94\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      network 192.168.200.0\n      broadcast 192.168.200.255\n      gateway 192.168.200.253\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n      address 192.168.101.64\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      network 192.168.101.0\n      broadcast 192.168.101.255\n      gateway 192.168.101.254\n\nAgain eth0 worked fine until I added eth1.

You should then be able to update via Synaptic or Software Center.\n", "Q: JFS vs. EXT4 vs. EXT3 \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the best way to partition, and what is the best file-system for a new Hard Disk? \n\nI've got a 2TB external HD on which I save valuable data. so far I'm using NTFS as my file system, but I find it quite slow because I've got lots of files there. (700GB of videos, 20GB of music, etc.)\nI want to encrypt some of the files (personal) and not the whole partition, and I would like the partition to run smoothly and not as laggy as now. \nI read about JFS and EXT4 and EXT3 but each of them has got pros and cons. Can someone explain to me which one is the best for my needs?\n\nA: Before ext4 came out, I switched my mythtv backend to JFS for all of it's drives simply because JFS offered the best speed vs. CPU usage when dealing with files that were 1G of larger.  This was especially true when comparing delete speed with ext3.\nThe one area I have seen some question is dealing with lots and lots of files being open at the same time.  Supposedly JFS does not do as well in this scenario as some of the other options, but for my application (storing lots of video files, with very little concurrent access) this isn't an issue.\nI have not compared things with ext4, since I don't really feel like rebuilding the machine at this point, so YMMV.\nOf course, the disclaimers of \"if it isn't NTFS, Windows won't read it\" apply.\n\nA: If you need to be able to access the disk from Windows, then you need to stick with NTFS, otherwise go with ext4.\n\nA: I have no issues with EXT4. It is what Ubuntu comes with as the default Journaling File System. It cannot be read on Windows, though.\nAs for JFS, It is a 64-bit File System. It will also not work On Windows, So If you are busy Dual-booting then NTFS will have to do.\nThey both have No Limits on Space (Well, Not for a while at 16 Petabytes for JFS and 16 Terabytes on EXT4) But It depends on user Preference :)\n\nA: I'd also like to add XFS to the mix.  I found it a bit more responsive especially with large files.  Ability to expand file system, and do a fs check without unmounting is pretty slick.  \nThough if you want to use Linux + Win, you're stuck on NTFS.\n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4313 takes ages to connect I'm having issues with my broadcom BCM4313 wireless adapter.

Is there a way I can build and run it on my own system, or would I have to pull the entire Ubuntu source code and integrate my patch into that, then run a test installation?\n\nA: There are a couple ways to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install ubiquity and edit the code on your machine (in /usr/lib/ubiquity/*).  Then just run it and play around.  It will adjust some global machine settings, so be prepared for your language or keyboard to change as you select values.  And remember you probably don't want to repartition your hard drive as you're using it (it actually won't let you).  But you can partition a thumb drive easily enough.\n\n*You can burn a Live CD/thumb drive easily enough and run it.  During installation, you can do the same trick and edit ubiquity's files in /usr/lib/ubiquity (Alt+Ctrl+T to bring up a Terminal).  You may need to kill any existing instances of ubiquity and restart it:\nsudo pkill ubiq\n\nubiquity --automatic # automatic because that's what the Live CD uses\n\nYou could also use a virtual machine to test, but that has always been more work than it's worth for me.  I usually just use method #1.\nThose are the easiest ways.  You could also grab the Ubuntu source, edit it, build a new package, install it, and then play with it.  But you indicated you wanted to avoid that.\n\nA: Just install the package, Insert the patch and In a Terminal run:\nubiquity\n\n", "Q: Cross platform file/disk encryption \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to encrypt external hard drive to be readable on any OS? \n\nAnyone know any program that works in Ubuntu to encrypt files/disk? I'm looking for something that will ask you for a password to open files when you plug in the pendrive/portable hard disk. If possible, is there any program that can run in both Ubuntu and Windows 7?  \n\nA: You can encrypt a file using GPG: http://www.linuxdynasty.org/how-to-encrypt-file-using-gpg.html\n", "Q: Error when running ./configure on Ubiquity source I have added a patch to the Ubiquity source and am attempting to build and install the package to test it, however I get the following error when I execute ./configure,\nchecking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config checking pkg-config is at least version\n0.9.0... yes checking for PANEL... yes checking for CHEESE... no configure: error: Package \nrequirements (glib-2.0\n        gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0\n        gobject-2.0\n        pygobject-2.0\n        cheese-gtk) were not met:\n\nNo package 'cheese-gtk' found\n\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you installed software in a \nnon-standard prefix.\n\nAlternatively, you may set the environment variables CHEESE_CFLAGS and CHEESE_LIBS to avoid \nthe need to call pkg-config. See the pkg-config man page for more details.\n\nThis is a truncated version - there's far more that came before this, but this is where the error occurred.\nI have no idea where to start with this. I tried checking man pkg-config, but that didn't really help, except I now have a vague understanding of what pkg-config is supposed to do. None of the packages listed as being missing can be found by apt-get. I got cheese (different from cheese-gtk apparently) installed, but that hasn't helped. I would really appreciate some help troubleshooting this.\n\nA: Install libcheese-gtk-dev, and it'll work. Also, when building from source, it's a good idea to run apt-get build-dep <package-name> before building from source a package that is also available in the repositories (including any third-party repositories you have activated). This will pull in all the packages upon which the building of the package is dependent. Thanks to Jorge Castro's comment and andrewsomething's answer for this.\n\nA: As you have already found out, you needed the libcheese-gtk-dev package. In the future, you can save yourself the headache of matching pkg-config checks with Ubuntu packages by using sudo apt-get build-dep ubiquity This will install all of the build dependencies for the package.\n", "Q: Why does Unity hide the menubar? Why does Unity hide the menubars by default, instead of showing them in the free space across the panel?\n\nA: One of the design goals of Unity is to reduce the clutter of the desktop, another is to use space more efficiently.\nWe hide the menu by default in Unity because the menu provides no useful information to which you can refer just by looking at it, but it puts a lot of detail on the screen which is visual clutter. So, we've taken the view that the menu is there if you need it (by moving the mouse to it or pressing Alt) but otherwise isn't in your view.\nMany modern applications are doing without a menu altogether, so in our view, this is a step towards the future, and it will encourage application developers to think about their interfaces and make them more usable by design rather than depending on the crutch of a menu.\n\nA: The conventions of FireFox and right click expediency particularly for organizing and deploying bookmarks directly contradicts Unity's conventions with no right click capability in the top menu bar.  \nIt is laudable that when driving a VW you shouldn't have the cockpit of a 747, and ap. screen real estate should not be overwhelmed by perverse permuted excessive controls and menus, leaving no space for actual content but ... this should not be at the expense of real functionality. \nThere are ways to get around the bottlenecks but it is manually laborious. Our custom developed aps suffer by default in Unity from forced exile to the top bar and must be repatriated back to their originating window to restore functionality and visibility (as custom aps the visible existence of the menu provides mnemonic aid to obscure menu items and, however infrequently, they are essential and used). \n", "Q: Persistent LiveUSB fails to install Nvidia drivers I have live Ubuntu (tried also Mint and Kubuntu, same effect) on a USB stick with persistence enabled. My laptop is however very noisy (VGA still on max?). I solved this problem before back with Mint 7 Gloria like:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nCtrl+Alt+Backspace (restart xserver). VGA then behaved reasonably.\nI can not reproduce these steps anymore with latest Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Mint.\nCan the problem be that I'm on a LiveUSB? Is it normal, then when selecting \"Additional Drivers\" for nVidia they always fail to install (those proprietary)?\n\nA: Yes, you can not install system packages from live usb installation. – João Pinto Jan 20 '11 at 21:31\n", "Q: Troubles with Acrobat Reader within Firefox?

I am able to enjoy all of the compiz desktop effects with screen resolution set lower than native, which is 1920X1080.  As soon as I switch to this resolution, when I go to change a wallpaper, the screen turns to colored lines or freezes.  All other effects work fine.  It is only the changing of wallpaper that causes this.  I have read that the ATI Xpress 200 GFX card is no longer supported by Linux, but there must be a way to rectify this one problem.

I normally do all my installs via PXE server, but I'm building a custom CD for kvm installs that are not on the same vlan as my PXE server.  I would prefer this CD was as small as possible and it fetched packages from the network like netinstall mini.iso CD does, but netinstall doesn't mount /cdrom like the server install CD does.  I need the cdrom for preseed.\nI've got my custom server install CD working, but it is still ~700MB.  Trying to modify \"dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz\" gives me no love as it complains that I've got a corrupt Packages.gz no matter what I do.  I'd rather the preseeded mirror was used rather than CD once it gets the cdrom setup.

When I log into my user account on Ubuntu 10.10, there is a unsatisfying delay before my system becomes usable.  Even launching a terminal, I have to wait a few seconds before the bash prompt appears.   During this start-up period, the top process seems to be dropbox.   I'm not sure what it's doing exactly (functionality is still fine as far as I can see), but I do know it really doesn't need to be doing it while I'm waiting for desktop to appear.  (This is the standard Ubuntu with Gnome desktop, by the way.)\nWhat I would like to do is to be able to have a static or even dependency-based delay for dropbox to start.  It would be nice if it waited for, e.g., 10 minutes, or for my browser tabs to load and a typing pause.  Then it could churn away on file status or cache-chewing, and I would be happy.  \nIs there a way to do this?   Thanks!\n\nA: I found myself having the same problem recently and the way I fixed it is a mixture of the two answers, the reason being that Dropbox would rewrite the launcher dropbox.desktop entry in ~/.config/autostart/ whether I had it ticked to start on startup or not. \nSo here are the steps you can take if you find yourself in a similar situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Untick the box to start on system startup (see first pick on Onalemon's answer)\n\n*Create a file that will be your custom application launcher in ~/.config/autostart/. You can use\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/theNameOfYourCustomLauncher.desktop. \nWhatever you want to call it, just don't call it dropbox.desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*paste in the following code using your own settings for the Name and the X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=NameOfYourCustomLauncher\nGenericName=File Synchronizer\nComment=Sync your files across computers and to the web\nExec=dropbox start\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=15 \nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=dropbox\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;\nStartupNotify=false\n\nAll that is left is for you to create a new startup launcher:\nI'm using the Gnome Shell, so I can just go to Applications ➜ System Tools ➜ Startup Applications or run gnome-session-properties on terminal and fill in the text boxes:\nName: NameOfYourCustomLauncher\nCommand: dropbox start -i\nComment: YourComment\n\nAnd that's it! After a restart it worked just fine.\n\nA: Delaying autostart with inbuilt delay option \nThis one works without the need for a script or sleep. Open your dropbox autostart entry in a text editor:\ngedit ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop\n\nAppend the following line to the file:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=foo\n\nwhere foo is the time in seconds you want to delay the application launch by, for instance\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=60\n\nwould delay the application start by one minute.\nSave the file, relog and you should see the effects.\n\nA: First, disable Dropbox from starting on login.\nOpen up the DropBox preferences and uncheck Start Dropbox on system startup: \n\nNow we will manually add Dropbox to the list of applications that run on login.\n Open up System ➜ Preferences ➜ Startup Applications and click on Add to add a new entry.  \nUse Dropbox for the name and bash -c \"sleep 10m && dropbox start -i\" for the command, and then click Add to save it.\n\nThat's it, now Dropbox won't start until 10 minutes after you have logged in.\n", "Q: Strange booting problems This is on Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition 64-bit.\nYesterday I installed kubuntu-desktop to give it a a try. I liked it, but decided to uninstall it. I followed these instructions: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome\nIt all went smoothly until I restarted. Now, after the splash screen (which changed back to the default one instead of the one I had before, which was caused by installing ATI drivers), the screen goes black and nothing happens.

I have a Reliance broadband + mobile broadband connection. It connects fine, but the only problem is it takes more than 2 -3 mins to get the connection started. If I plug in the USB datacard, the network manager applet dothes not show up the mobile broadband connection immediately. It takes a good 2-3 mins to detect the connection before I can select Reliance connection from the dropdown list.\nIs there any way of getting a shortcut of that connection on the desktop or on the panel?\nThanks,\nSayantan\n\nA: It takes time to boot for your modem too, don't forget. If it connects automatically its as fast as it gets (probably). Set up automatic connection. removing pin helped me since i'm not afraid to lose modem.\n\nA: You can create \"connections\" in Network Manager (right click on its icon, Edit Connections) which would allow quick access to some connections you will likely be repeatedly using.\n\nA: As from your question i can understand that you are asking for a faster way to start up the internet. Does data card's active light is on immediately when plugged into the computer.If yes then there might be a bug in the data card's software.Report the problem to ISP, they might correct by providing an update.If no, there might a problem problem with your hardware.It might be your usb port or data card etc.Try plugging the data card in other usb port. \n\nA: With mobile broadband there is also the possibilty that network aquisition is simply slow the time to start up and fully negotiate a 3G cellular data connection can range from as little as a few seconds to several minutes depending on a range of factors.  Signal strength and quality is often a big one as is interference, you can often get an idea of signal strength from the device itself or a mobile phone using the same network though that says less for quality.\nHave you a mobile phone on the same network if so try taking the phone removing it's battery and cold starting it to get it to completely lock onto the network from scratch as soon as it loads hit the web browser and see how long it is before you manage to load a major website.  Count the time from pressing the power button to the page load as in general terms mobile phones have hardware to handle the network side that will be setting up while the software is still booting too.\nIf you have a poort signal this could be a fact of life the connections for mobile broadband can take longer than phones also sometimes as the latter are often deliberately run at lower data rates etc than the full mobile broadband data service by for example not using all the channels leaving less to test for usability in the connection negotiation.\nIf however all looks good for siganal and using a mobile phone to do it then the problem is likely the USB modem or perhaps the USIM contact your ISP they should be able in most cases to provide a new sim for free and if it is under 12 months old the modem too most likely.  Trying another USB port might help preferably on a different hub (generally the front ports on a computer are a different root USB hub in hardware to the rear so swap them over.  That will only apply however if the problem appears to be slow detection of the hardware not a connection matter.\n\nA: If as you say this works well in windows 7 I would make sure that windows 7 connection information was copied to the Linux connection manager. This may or may not include dns servers or domains, security types and network ID\n\nA: On the network connections, edit your mobile broadband connection. On it have you ticked on the check box to connect automatically on the top? If not, check this box.

The standard Ubuntu tool pops up a dialog to ask where I want to save the file, I would like a tool that doesn't ask and just saves on the Desktop or wherever as 00001.png 00002.png etc.\n\nA: Shutter is quite impressive, with lots of features, but still requires user interaction to capture the window that currently has the focus.  I.e., when Edit->Preferences->Keyboard->Capture with selection is enabled, and \"Window\" is specified, Shutter still waits for the user to select the desired window, instead of automatically capturing the window that currently has the focus.\nFor fully automatic screen captures I found that scrot works perfectly, both for full screen captures, and capturing the current window (via the -u option), as described here:\nhttp://www.khattam.info/save-screenshots-in-ubuntu-automatically-when-printscreen-key-is-pressed-2009-05-12.html  The only (very minor) issue I saw with scrot is that it cannot take more than one screen shot per second.  But since it seems to take longer than a second to complete a screen capture anyway, this doesn't seem like much of an issue.\nI enabled scrot (after installing it via Synaptic Package Manager) by changing my <Print> and <Alt><Print> hotkey bindings to do full screen and current window captures (respectively) and it works perfectly, as described here: How can I restore default keyboard shortcuts?\nIn gconf-editor I set them to save to the /tmp directory by specifying these associations under apps->metacity->global_keybindings:\n\n\n*\n\n*run_command_screenshot -> Print\n\n*run_command_window_screenshot -> <Alt>Print\nand these associations under apps->metacity->keybinding_commands: \n\n\n*\n\n*command_screenshot -> /usr/bin/scrot '/tmp/Screenshot-%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S.png'\n\n*command_window_screenshot -> /usr/bin/scrot -u '/tmp/Screenshot-%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S.png'\nI did not have to restart anything for these changes to take effect.\nI am running Ubuntu 10.04, Gnome Desktop 2.30.2.\n\nA: As for scrot - in order to take screenshots more frequent then one per second I suggest using the following command bound with Key Shortcut:\nscrot ~/shots/'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.png' -e 'TMPSCRN=$f; mv $f $${TMPSCRN%.png}-`date +%3N`.png'\n\nsince scrot doesn't support %N as nanoseconds it is quite good workarround.\nNote that, here in example nanoseconds were shrinked into miliseconds using first 3 digits from nanoseconds pattern expression: %3N. Local variable $TMPSCRN was used because string manipulation on shrot $f filename variable I found myself hard to implement yet impossible.\nIf you'd like to take the shots in .jpg format, you need to replace all occurances of .png with .jpg\n\nA: Shutter  has an option to automatically save screenshots, incrementing the filename each time.\nEdit ➜ Preferences ➜ Main ➜ Save :\n \nTo make Shutter take the screenshots when you hit PrtScr,\ngo to Edit ➜ Preferences ➜ Keyboard and check the Capture checkbox: \n\nIf you don't want the Shutter window to pop up every time you take a screenshot, go to Edit ➜ Preferences ➜ Behavior and uncheck Present main window after taking a screenshot :\n\n", "Q: Are there any goals for the update manager behavior with Unity?

The solution I found which has worked through 9.10 - 10.10 is detailed here.\nMounting Windows SMB File Shares Using Cifs \nits a bit of an old post but it still works for me probably the most important part is adding the package smbfs as without this (which isn't installed by default) fstab wont be able to mount the shares.\nHope this helps\n\nA: For 11.10, my system found the GoFlex Home 3TB automatically after clicking \"Browse Network\" in the file manager.  Seamless.  (I don't know what AFP volumes are, but Ubuntu apparently does.)\nAlternatively, I was also able to mount it as a CIFS drive by editing /etc/fstab, using general mount instructions on the net.  \nI'd only recommend this for people who are comfortable with manually editing their home network and using the terminal.  Particular for this NAS, some key steps were:\n1) Edit my router to always allocate the same IP number to the GoFlex (compared to the default where the number could change upon reboot--for safety, I also edited the GoFlex configuration to always request the same number).\n2) To keep spaces in fstab from being confused as the mountpoint/type/options/etc, replace the device name GoFlex Home Personal to the character escaped Goflex\\040Home\\040Personal.  \nReferences:\nhttp://www.openstora.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=675\nhttp://www.thatsquality.com/articles/mounting-windows-smb-file-shares-using-cifs\nhttp://en.kioskea.net/faq/2287-fstab-adding-spaces-in-the-mount-point-path\nWrite Speed:\nCIFS seems faster, but I'll admit I haven't tried every combination/option possible.  Comparing the manual CIFS mount to the automatic AFP volumes, on my admittedly slow wired connection (on my generally slow machine, reading from an ntfs partition), music files wrote over cifs at 10MB/s and over AFP at 3MB/s.  \nNote: 3MB/s was a write to 'GoFlex Home Public' which can be accessed by my TV as a DLNA drive, so the GoFlex might be indexing or recognizing the files as media.  If so, that could explain the delay.  Transferring photos via AFP goes at 5MB/s.\n\nA: I know it's different hardware but I recently bought a Netgear Stora which I had the same issues with, i.e. Netgear said it was compatible with Linux but really meant that I could access it with a browser.\nI managed to get fstab configured to mount the drives during boot (your mileage may vary due to the different hardware).\nI blogged about it here (mainly so that when I pave my system for 11.04 I'd not have to trawl the web again!) but the content is similar to Allans link (wish I'd seen that earlier in the week!)\nHope this helps :-)\n", "Q: Copy all bridge traffic to a specific interface I have a bridge/switch set up an a machine that has multiple ports. Occasionally, I have a vm running through virtualbox, and I'll have it use a virtual adapter and then I add the adapter to the bridge. I have heard that some switches can copy all the traffic they see to a specific port on the bridge, usually for network monitoring. I would like to be able to run some windows based network tools. I do not want to run Windows on the actual hardware, because it would be lots of work to duplicate my setup in windows, so I was thinking if I can copy all traffic to a port, I can send it to a VM with windows. How can I set this up? I think this might be ebtables area, but I don't know ebtables well enough to know for sure, and it always seems like (from my understanding of ebtables) ebtables does something with the traffic (drop, accept, etc), but never copies it.\n\nA: I think that daemonlogger \n will do want you want.  \n\nIt is capable of operating in two\n  modes: sniffing packets and  logging\n  them directly to disk (files are\n  automatically rolled over  after 1GB\n  of data), or in a \"soft-tap\" mode\n  where it mirrors packets  on another\n  interface.\n\nIt is is the repository, so sudo apt-get install daemonlogger will get you started.\nSyntax would be similar to \nsudo daemonlogger -i <input_interface> -o <mirror_interface>\n\nwhere the arguments are explained as \n   -i <interface>\n   Set interface to grab data from to <interface>.\n\n   -o <interface>\n   Disable logging, instead mirror  traffic  from  -i  <interface>  to  -o\n   <interface>.\n\nThe biggest caveat is that you need to make sure that the destination port is capable of receiving the retransmitted traffic.\nIf you need more specific configuration guidance, you'd need to give more details on your bridge and interface setup.  \n\nA: I do not believe this is possible with a Linux-based software bridge (at least, not in its current version). If it were, it should be an option in the brctl utility.\nYes, many physical Ethernet switches have some kind of a mirroring/monitoring capability, which would allow you to designate an interface within the bridge to send all traffic to. It sounds like this would be a good enhancement for situations like yours.\nEdit: you may be able to use a traffic control rule to accomplish this.\n", "Q: How to programatically manipulate application windows? Anyone know a library, preferably for ruby or python, that will let you access a list of open applications and let you manipulate them? All I really want to be able to do is change their geometry and minimize or close them. I've been messing around with ruby-gnome2 a bit but haven't found anything for manipulating windows other than the ones of your own process.\nI'm using 10.10.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this would be using wmctrl. You can read man wmctrl to see how to use it.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nYou could basically bind the command line to a 'Window' class and add methods to it that use wmctrl commands in the background.\nclass Window\n    @@windows = []\n    def self.windows\n        @@windows\n    end\n    def self.get_windows\n        @@windows.clear\n        `wmctrl -l`.split(\"\\n\").map do |str|\n            @@windows << self.class.new(str.split(' ')*)\n        end\n    end\n    def initialize window_id, desktop_id, client_machine, window_title\n        #set up object here\n    end\n    #add other methods here\nend\n\nThat should be a good starting point. It's not tested or anything but you should be able to work it out from here. You could now add instance methods, eg. change_geometry, which could utilise the -r <WIN> -e <MVARG> option.\nYou should familiarise your self with pipes and IO in general before doing this.\nPerhaps when you have accomplished what you need to, you can distribute this as a ruby library and package it for Debian/Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use the Extended Window Manager Hints spec to tell the WM to change some windows. This is the trick that wmctrl uses. \nUsually you need to use XLib to use EWMH, but for python there is this nice project: PyTile. It's a python program to tile the windows. Not only is it a nice example, it has wrapped the most important functionality into one class. Just download the source and take a look at Probe.py, it does most of what you ask.\nThis example maximizes all the windows:\nimport Probe\n\nprob=Probe.Probe()\nwinlist=prob.get_window_list()\nfor win in winlist:\n    prob.window_maximize(win)\n\n\nA: Hey there,\nhave a look at wmctrl. It's not an actual library, but a command line script that allows window manipulation via command line switches. You'd certainly be able to call it via system.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nI use it in many shell scripts, and sometimes perl scripts using system()\nhth\n", "Q: Why doesn't desktop unlock screen accept my password? To unlock a my computer after waking it from standby or screen saver I sometimes have to enter my password many times before it's accepted. What's wrong with it?\nUPDATE:\n\n\n*NOT a wireless keyboard - a plain wired Dell RT7D50 USB keyboard and the laptop's built-in keyboard, same behaviour.\n\n*All the dots do appear.\n\n*Sometimes switching language to a different and back to English seems to help.\n\n*There are no problems with keyboards in any other case - only when entering the password in wakeup unlock dialogue. For example when I install applications or reconfigure something and the system asks to enter the password - it is always accepted immediately.\n\nA: please check your keyboard's settings.May be changing a different setting for keyboard might solve your problem.\n\nA: If we are dealing with a wireless keyboard my first suggestion would be to check the keyboard batteries and replace them to be sure.  Then you would be advised to repair the keyboard with the reciever in case of interference that has appeared on the channel, this is truye even if it previously worked fine as the local radio environment may have changed with new emission sources etc external to your home.\nThe fact it does eventually work makes me think the info being sent is getting messed up somehow thus suspecting a wireless keyboard happens more with them.  If it was a bad keyboard setting it would be consistent till the setting were changed I suspect.  The other possibility with both a wired or wireless keyboard a defective keyboard or key is possible try testing each of the keys used in the password yourself.  Perhaps by typing it out a few times is any of the letters/numers/symbols sometimes missing or altered?  If so you could try cleaning the keyboard but the chances are a replacement will be needed fortunately they are cheap.\n\nA: Do you have a sticky key? This could be your problem, I had a malfunctioning 'a' on My Laptop keyboard that kept sticking. Try another Keyboard maybe?\n\nA: Do you have Sticky Keys enabled?\nNot a physically broken key like MichealH suggested, but the software option under\nSystem->Preferences->Keyboard, Accessibility, Simulate simultaneous keypresses.\nI had that enabled, and was also in the habit of waking the computer by pressing Shift.\nIf that's the case, either press something else, or get in the habit of pressing Shift two or three times, whichever works.\n\nA: If changing language helps, then it would be the language settings changing your keyboard layout. Make sure you check the same keyboard is used for both languages. For example the @ symbol on a US keyboard is different to a european keyboard. Many of the puncuation keys have also moved between layouts.\n", "Q: After login in the desktop remains blank I have installed Ubuntu 10 last night and finished all upgrading stuff, in the time when updates are applied I downloaded a torrent file.

For example, a recent paper cut I've worked on involved changing the string \"Reboot Anyway\" to \"Restart Anyway\" when gnome-session detected applications still running during restart. When I greped for the offending string, I found not only the string on the Gtk button, but identical strings in a long list of .po files which I later learned contained translations. \nThe format of these translations of along the lines of\nmsgid:Reboot Anyway\n<translated text>\n\nChanging the text of only the button would results in a discrepancy between the text on the English button and the translation, and changing the msgid line would result in a similar situation. How should I raise the issue that new translations are needed? I know this is a trivial problem in this example, but there are other such bugs that involve rewriting entire paragraphs of text.\n\nA: You should just create a patch that changes the string in the code, and the rest should be taken care of for you.\nWhen the package is built, the translation template (the gnome-session.pot file) will be regenerated and will pick up your changed string. The template will then be uploaded into Launchpad and the new strings will be exposed for translation there. The old \"Reboot Anyway\" translations will be marked as obsolete.\nSince it is such a visible string, I would strongly encourage you to let the Ubuntu translators know about this, to make sure they are aware of the change and that this string does not unnoticedly become untranslated. You should simply send an e-mail explaining the change to the ubuntu-translators list.\nYou might have already done that, but this is a really visible change, and one that will mean we'll have to carry diverged translations in Ubuntu, so I'd also encourage you to talk to the upstream gnome-session maintainers to see if the change can be accepted there first, which will make the process a lot easier, both for packagers and translators.\n", "Q: How to prevent ubuntu to change theme automatically \nPossible Duplicate:\nDesktop forgets theme? \n\nSuddenly after restart my default theme turned into a theme like this, \nEvery time i change the theme it gets changed into a custom theme like this\nCan somebody tell me how can i find the cause of this problem\nThanks\n\n\nA: A short sleep in /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-settings-daemon fixes it:\nExec= bash -c \"sleep 2; /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gnome-settings-daemon\"\nAlso see: Bug #574266\n", "Q: How to change my mouse wheel scroll rate?

The setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on this location.\n\nTherefore an application that needs /home or even subfolders like /home/user/Music to run needs to be considered to have a bug.\nNevertheless, there may be applications that look up standard directories as defined by xdg-user-dirs, as BTW does your system when you change locale.\nIt may most likely be safe to simply rename standard folders in your home, but it is a much better idea to notify xdg-user-dirs the way lukasz already pointed out to avoid unwanted side effects from applications that rely on existing standard paths.\n", "Q: Open or convert .cdr files? I have a scanned image, and it's in Corel Draw (.cdr) format (~6mb). Is there a way to open it, or convert it to something that I can manage? I tried http://filespazz.com/ a few times, but it didn't work due to some timeout error.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Another option is to try imagemagick convert utility,Imagemagic can be easily installed using software center or synaptic.\nSince the document is scanned it should be a bitmap which imagemagick can handle, only the version of the .cdr would be a concern, you did not mention the version of the cdr file so you may just try imagemagick, at your terminal in the directory where the .cdr file is located, run the convert utility like this;\nconvert image.cdr image.png\n\nthis will convert the .cdr image called image.cdr to a .png image called image.png file that you can easily use, probably vectorize by tracing in inkscape if you wish.\nSee the imagemagic documentation on the convert utility if more control over the output is needed. hope the output is satisfactory.\n\nA: Very simple and fast solution .cdr files could be open in libre office draw (actually it is default) Libre office draw has perfect save as for example to .png Than GIMP. Enjoy\n\nA: Source.\n\nIn order to work with CDR images you need to install some delegates\n  for ImageMagick. In order to convert CDR files you need to install\n  uniconvertor for CDR delegate:  \nsudo apt-get install python-uniconvertor\n\nList of all delegates:\nconvert -list delegate\n\nBy default it outputs:\ncdr =>          \"uniconvertor\" \"%i\" \"%o.svg\"; mv \"%o.svg\" \"%o\"\n\nThen run:\nconvert image.cdr -flatten -thumbnail '512x512' image.png\n\nOr with zoom cropping:\nconvert image.cdr -flatten -thumbnail '512x512^' -gravity center -crop 512x512+0+0 +repage image.png\n\nI convert to .png here, but you may choose your own output format.\n\n", "Q: Two gedit plugins clash. How to change shortcut keys, or enable/disable a plugin Gedit has two plugins from Gnome's Gedit Plugins page which I both particularly want...  \n\n\n*\n\n*Multi-edit  \n\n*Control Your Tabs\nHowever they both vie for the same shortcut keys: Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown  \nI can see two possible solutions, and maybe there are more,,,(there usually is :)   \nThe best solution may be to change the shorcut keys in Multi-edit to Shift+Ctrl+PageUp and Shift+Ctrl+PageDown... but I've very little python knowledge, and how to do it escapes me..   \nThe simplest method (for me) is to just toggle them on/off via another shortcut-key. I know the command to toggle the Multi-edit feature on/off (but not the entire script)...  Basically, for this option, I need a command to toggle a Gedit Plugin on/off..\nEither, or both (,or other) solutions would be appreciated...  \nUPDATE: I'm looking for a command-line command (vs, a menu command),\nand/or a 'fix' for Multi-edit's python script.  \nNote: The  'Edit Shortcuts' plugin does not show the Multi-edit plugin... (so I can't do it that way)\n\nA: I wrote the following python script (download) that enables/disables the Multi-edit plugin:\n#!/usr/env/python\n\nimport re\nimport commands\n\nactive_plugins = commands.getoutput(\"gconftool --get /apps/gedit-2/plugins/active-plugins\")\n\nr1 = re.compile(r'multi_edit')\n\nif r1.search(active_plugins):\n    # Disable multi-edit plugin\n    active_plugins = re.sub(\"multi_edit,|,multi_edit\",\"\", active_plugins)\n\nelse:\n    # Enable multi-edit plugin\n    active_plugins = re.sub(\"]\",\",multi_edit]\", active_plugins)\n    \ncommands.getoutput(\"gconftool --set --type=list --list-type=string /apps/gedit-2/plugins/active-plugins \"+active_plugins)\n\n\nTo toggle Multi-edit with a keyboard shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*Save the script as toggle-multi-edit.py in your home folder.\n\n\n*Open up System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts.

If your MP3/MP4 files still do not work, you will need to download the restricted codecs pack. Search for these in Google and use the above command to install them once you find out what the file-name is. I.e., type in sudo apt-get install [filename].\nDVD playback is the same as above, you will need the restricted repositories. Again, once you locate them, just type in the above.\nEDIT:\nAll of the above, and indeed many other countless codecs and programs can also be installed through the Synaptic Package Manager. To access this, click Systems > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager.\nThis can be a bit of a headache though, as there are many, many things available, and if you do not know the specific program name or keywords for it used through the search function, it can be difficult.\n\nA: My solution was to go to Tools > Preferences > Video, make sure Enable video and Window decorations were checked, then set the Output drop-down menu to X11 video output (XCB).\nSee this answer for more information.\n\nA: Try xine or VNC media players, My personal choice is xine because it uses very little resources.

I'm normally using ch_FR. \n(You might want to print the keyboard layout.)\nEdit: I repost my comment which has actually solved the problem\nI got it! With I guess normal fr_CA, (if I add it by \"By Language\" with French in the first dropdown and Canada in the second).\nYou have to enable a Compose key:\nYou hold the compose key simultaneously with Alt Gr (left of space bar) and push ; to get the ~ (it will not yet show up) then you hit n to get ñ. Sometimes it's a bit buggy and you have to hit the tripple key combo twice before hitting n.\nFor ¡ you use compose key + shift + ! (1) and for ¿ it would be compose key + shift + ? (6). Again sometimes you'll have to hit the tripple key combo twice .\n\nA: At least in Natty, the “Canda French (legacy)” layout has most of what you want; the \"¿\" is right alt + shift + \"-\"; right alt + \"ç\" gives you dead ascii tilde (so you go right alt + ç + n to get ñ). Not sure how to get ¡, however; depending on how often you use it, know that in GTK apps using the default input mechanism typing ctrl + shift + u followed by the unicode codepoint followed by whitespace will enter that unicode character, so ctrl+shift+u a1 space produces a “¡”.\n\nHowever, more interesting is the “Canda Multilingual”, which seems (from me just looking at it for a little while) to have all the same main keys as the french legacy keyboard, but with a lot more right-alt variants:\n\n", "Q: The simplest workspace switcher?

About a week ago I used the windows installer to install Ubuntu to an extra hard drive I had because I've heard so much about it. Since [I guess] Wubi is meant for people with limited disk space who want to dual boot, it only allocates 30G of space to Ubuntu. \nMy situtation is that I have an extra ~170G of disk space that isn't being used, since I'm not dual-booting from one disk. Is there a way to make Ubuntu use that free space without reinstalling.\n\nA: Wubi is great for experimentation of Ubuntu. If you really want more than 30 GBs of space you might want to consider actually dual-booting. The thing is that Wubi uses Windows' native filesystem and is very susceptible to the corruptions and downsides of it. To be using Ubuntu heavily enough to warrant over 30 GBs of usage... it might be worth your while to take the plunge and just install it.\n\nA: Since you cannot resize while Ubuntu runs, I would suggest Deleting the leftover space and making it mount as /home.\nOR\nBoot up the Live CD and Boot the Partition Editor. Grow the partition using the GUI.\n\nA: installing would allow you to use the disc space And hear are some ubuntu uses ext4 file system. ubuntu can run at full speed. easer to manage when on two different partitions,\n", "Q: Add Windows 7 to boot menu    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1          13      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS   - system restore\n/dev/sda2              13        4674    37436416    7  HPFS/NTFS  - Windows 7\n/dev/sda3            4674       58843   435116032    7  HPFS/NTFS -  data storage\n/dev/sda4           58843       60802    15728640   83  Linux - Ubuntu 10.10\n\nInitially I installed StartUpManager.

Why is ufw firewall included in Ubuntu, when it is not enabled and pre-configured by default? Most users don't even know it is there, because no GUI frontend is provided.\n\nA: In Ubuntu or any other Linux the firewall is a part of the base system and is called iptables/netfilter. It is always enabled.\niptables consists of a set of rules on what to do and how to behave when a packet if going out of coming in. If you want to explicitly block incoming connections from a specific IP, you will need to add a rule. Actually you don't need to do so. Relax. \nIf you want good security from anything, remember don't install random softwares from anywhere. It might screw up your default security settings.Don't run as root ever. Always trust the official repos.\nI think what you wanted to ask was that if the UI is installed or not?\n\nA: Out of the box, Ubuntu ships with no TCP or UDP ports open, hence the belief that there's no reason to run Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) by default.  I agree, though, that having ufw disabled is a strange decision.  My reasoning being that inexperienced users are feasibly going to install things like Samba, Apache and such like as they experiment with the system put before them.  If they don't understand the implications of this, they will expose themselves to malicious bevaviour on the internet.\nExample - I've got my laptop configured with Samba which is fine in my home network protected with WPA2.  But if I take my laptop to a Starbucks, I might not think anything of it, but that laptop is now advertising my shares to all and sundry.  With a firewall, I can restrict my samba ports to only my home server or peer devices.  No need to worry as much now about who might be trying to connect to my laptop.  Same goes for VNC, SSH, or a huge number of other useful services my laptop might be running, or trying to connect to.\nUbuntu takes a very on/off approach to certain elements of security, a philosophy I can't agree with.  Security might be technically on or off, but by layering elements of security over one another, you end up with a better system.  Sure, Ubuntu's security is good enough for a large number of use cases, but not all.\nBottom line, run ufw.  Better safe than sorry.\nUncomplicated Firewall has a number of graphical front ends, but the simplest is Gufw.\n\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nHere, I'm allowing all traffic from specific server VLANs in my corporate environment and I've added a rule to allow the necessary ports for a reverse SSH session to bounce off this machine.\n\n\nA: Also, gufw can provide a GUI front-end.  (It isn't really more intuitive than ufw on the command line, to me, but it does give you a more visual reminder of what is there.) I agree that the firewall is not advertised well at present.  If I were to guess, I'd say this is to prevent new users from shooting themselves in the foot. \n\nA: In contrast to Microsoft Windows, an Ubuntu desktop does not need a firewall to be safe on the Internet, since by default Ubuntu does not open ports that can introduce security issues. \nIn general a properly hardened Unix or Linux system will not need a firewall. Firewalls (except of certain security problems with Windows computers) make more sense to block internal networks to the Internet. In this case local computers can communicate with each other over open ports which are blocks towards the outside by the firewall. In this case, the computers are intentionally opened up for internal communications which should not be available outside the internal network.\nThe standard Ubuntu desktop would not require this, hence ufw is not enabled by default. \n\nA: Because: passwords or crypto-keys.\nThis is IMO the correct answer, and thus far, quite a different answer than the others. ufw is disabled by default for the convenience of the majority of Ubuntu users who know that passwords are an important form of protection to provide privacy and restricted control. The majority of Ubuntu users will \"vet\" software by installing from Ubuntu-approved repositories and be careful about other sources, in order to minimize risks in general, not just risk related to ports. By doing so they go a long way to minimizing the port-related risk which was already small because they use \"normal\" passwords and very small if they use hard-to-brute passwords or crypto-keys.\nSome of the risks cited such as Samba file server, Apache HTTP server, SSH, VNC on a Starbucks (public) WiFi would typically be eliminated by hard-to-brute passwords on the host. \nufw \"breaks\" software, as a firewall should, which is the reason why it is disabled by default. To test this on a fresh install of Ubuntu, server A, install ssh and login from another machine, client B, on the same local network and you will see it works immediately. Logout. Then go back to server A and sudo ufw enable. Go back to client B and you will fail to ssh to server A.\n", "Q: LiveCD mounts the partitions, but it doesn't see any I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 from Live CD.\nI can access the partitions already created ( two NTFS and one ext3 prepared ), but when I'm trying to install, at the step where I should select the partition, I don't have from where to choose.\nThe list is empty, as you can see in the screenshot below:  \n\nMy HDD is @ S-ATA. \nMotherboard: AsRock ConRoeXFire-eSATA2\n\nA: \"I can access the partitions already created\" -- does that mean you mounted them?\nThe installer doesn't like your volumes mounted - gparted will error.\nI suggest setting up a new partition table with the installer, as long as it not gonna mess up your Windows partition.\n\nA: $ mount  \n\nwill show you all your mounted partitions\n$ umount /dev/[sda*]  \n\nrepace [sda*] with your disk/partition identifier. \nwill umount your partition. \numount the partitions to get access to them in the installer. \nOr right click the partitions in nautilus and click umount them to make them available in the installer. \n", "Q: Shutdown / restart does not complete Sometimes when I try to shut-down or restart, I get an error saying:\nA program is still running: Unknown Not Responding\nIt gives three choices\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock Screen\n\n*Cancel\n\n*Reboot anyway (or Shutdown Anyway)\n\n\nWhat should I look for?\nIf I could configure it to always assume that I want to shutdown anyway, then that would be great.\nThanks\n\nA: Try running \"xlsclients -a\" (or \"xlsclients -la\" for more detail). The output is a little cryptic so you might consider installed a useful utility called wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nYou can then run \"wmctrl -lv\" which will list the graphical apps running. What's nice about wmctrl is that the output includes the title of each graphical app so for example a firefox process might show up as \"Ask Ubuntu - Stack Exchange - Mozilla Firefox\".\nThe hex value included in the first column of the wmctrl output is the window ID. This can be used to kill an application using the standard xkill command which will look up the process id corresponding to the window ID and kill it. For example:\n  xkill -id 0x024000e9\n\n\nA: This usually happens when there is an application still running and using the CPU. At the same time you do not close it and you restart or shutdown.\nYou have to wait for some time and it will close by itself until the process is finished - otherwise it means the application is not responding.\nWhat is the name of the application that repeatedly does this?\nTry to cancel it when you get this problem and try to run sudo reboot from terminal and edit your question to include the output - this may help in finding a solution.\n\nA: As others have said, the command line commands sudo reboot and sudo halt, will always reboot or shutdown the computer without asking any questions. Those commands will send all running programs a TERMinate signal and shortly afterwards KILL any process, which did not already quit. This means that you will loose unsaved work (as if all programs crashed.) Therefore, you should only use sudo reboot after closing anything you care about. (Even if you have saved your work, applications are likely to have not yet updated their configuration files.)\nThe GUI shutdown command works differently by design. I does various checks prior to the actual shutdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is any other user logged in?\n\n*Are any (GUI) applications running? (If yes, tell them to save all data and quit)\n\n\nOnly if the answers to the questions above is No, it will continue like sudo reboot. An application, which is busy (with saving or something else), is never forcibly stopped, unless you confirm to reboot anyway.\nIn your case, there appears to be a strange application still running. Ubuntu doesn't know its name ('Unknown') and the application does not responded to the \"Quit+Save, because the user wants to reboot\"-command. This should never happen, and as a safety measure, Ubuntu will not reboot.\n", "Q: Triple monitor setup with an ATI Radeon 4200? I have a relatively new Powerspec computer (i5 quad core processor, about a year or two old) and just grabbed a new relatively inexpensive ($40?) graphics card. It has 1 DVI, one VGA, and one HDMI output. \nI have two (different type) monitors plugged into the DVI and VGA slots, and they work great. However, I cannot seem to be able to get a third monitor in the HDMI slot to work. I can see the monitor (and monitor info) show up in display settings. However, if I try to switch the monitor to 'on' and click apply, nothing happens.\nAnyone have the slightest idea what the problem might be? (It's a Radeon graphics card FYI; if I remember right I think it was the Radeon 4200?)\n\nA: Sorry, based on the information in your question your card doesn't support three monitors.\nThe AMD/ATI technology for driving more than two monitors from the same card is called Eyefinity, but it is only supported on certain cards, see AMD's Eyefinity FAQ.\nIn brief, you need \n\n\n*\n\n*one of the Radeon models listed in the FAQ (all in the 5000 and 6000 series) \n\n*and the card must have a DisplayPort connector.\n\n\nThe DisplayPort must be used for the third monitor.\nIn addition, AMD does not officially support Eyefinity on Radeon cards for Linux yet.

I am not a basic user of computers, but frankly I have never done a partition of a hard drive. But I decided to shrink the only HD in the computer by 25GB for Ubuntu, however I realized that Ubuntu will partition the HD. However, I am stuck with a 25GB partition that I can not use, at least I think so... Can I use the partition when installing Ubuntu (version 9.10) or can I make the partition apart of the rest of the drive again? When I try to delete it, Windows 7 (the only OS at the moment) prompts me stating that it is an extended partition and will be inaccessible if I do so.\nHelp?\n\nA: Have a read through the community documentation here, if the empty partition is formatted as NTFS you will need to change it to ext3 or ext4 to install Ubuntu on. \nThe Win7 partition should be clearly labelled as such when you open GParted to view your hard drive and if you do not select it for formatting it will remain untouched by the installation of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use this partition for ubuntu.

Most of these applications use the same backend and thus most work and effort from different projects is pooled into few similar resources. So the .m4v video that plays fine in Totem will also play fine in Banshee, Songbird, Amarok, Boxstream, Kaffeine, etc. There are different backends as well, of course; the fact remains, however, that most projects work together on the ability to read file formats - it's merely the interfaces and ideologies of application developments that are different.\n\nA: Every video player mentioned in What video players do you recommend?.\n", "Q: Re-mouting the old home partition after a fresh install Thanks to this thread I know now that I should've done this during the installation part.

I rather keep my data on that partition but if that is not option I still want to move my home folder. My system partition is just too small to host the home directory. \n\nA: You can do 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot live CD, find what drive is current home and your old home (you can use nautilus) then open fstab on disk (not live CD) that is on /media/<your-roots-UUID>/etc/fstab (you can find UUIDs with df -h ) and switch the mount points\n\n*you can copy old home to the new location and vice versa (in that case make sure you copy also the hidden files so you get configs too and encrypted folder if you have one)\ngood luck!\n\nA: I cannot test this, but I think it's worth a try. Without logging into X, switch to a console CTRLALTF1. Log in, make a directory to store your current home directory, and then modify the account to move the current home directory. \nsudo mkdir /mnt/tmp\nsudo usermod -d /mnt/tmp/$USER -m $USER\nlogout\n\nLogin again without X.

The first commands just gets your current setting, which is likely false:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'true'\n\nregards,\n\nA: As mentioned in the comments, the solution mentioned above doens't work for Ubuntu 11.10.

I've recently installed Ubuntu on Oracle's Virtualbox.  Now I want to install the guest additions.\nI started up my Ubuntu guest OS, clicked \"Devices\" and chose \"Install Guest Additions\". Nothing happened, and I don't see the CD icon on my desktop.\nHow can I make this work?\n\nA: I think the right way to do this right now (2020-Apr-27) with the newest stable Ubuntu (20.04) and the current Virtualbox (6.1.6) is to just do the following:\nsudo apt install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11 virtualbox-guest-utils\nI just did that and it worked.\nI guess this won't get a lot of attention down here but at least if somebody searches for 20.04 they might be able to find some more recent information. ;)\n\nA: The virtualbox-guest-additions package has to be installed. Furthermore, it may appear that nothing has happened, but all the \"Install Guest Additions\" button do is mounting the cdrom. You should open the File manager (Nautilus / Dolphin), select the \"CD device\" and run the installer.\n\nA: \nIf you have trouble installing Ubuntu in a VirtualBox VM, because the installer window does not fit the low resolution screen size, you can move the window with Alt+F7.\n\nInstalling Guest additions from the repositories\nIn case we have installed the OSE edition of Virtual Box from the repositories we can add the guest additions from the repositories in the guest. This will install guest additions matching the Virtual Box version as obtained from the repositories. It is not recommended to install these in newer releases of Virtual Box as obtained from the Oracle repository (see below).\nAlternatively we can install the package virtualbox-guest-additions-iso in the host Ubuntu. \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nThe .iso file with an image of the OSE edition of the guest additions CD will install in the host directory /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso. Mount this .iso file as a CD in your virtual machine's settings. In the guest you will then have access to a CD-ROM with the installer.  \nInstalling Guest Additions from Virtual Box Manager\nIn case the Guest Additions fail to build we may have to install the Linux kernel headers (see How do I install kernel header files?) or build-essential  tools in addition. It is also recommended to have dkms  installed (see below - Note 4). You can run this command in a terminal to install both:\nsudo apt install build-essential dkms\n\nSelecting Devices -> Install Guest Additions (or press Host+D from the Virtual Box Manager) the Guest Additions CD .iso will be loaded but not installed in your guest OS. To install we need to run the installer script VBoxLinuxAdditions.run as root or from the Autorun Prompt (see below).\n\nGNOME Shell\nTo install the Guest Additions we will have a CD icon on our desktop as soon as the virtual drive is mounted:\n\nNext step is to run the autorun.sh script (as root) on this mounted CD by opening the drive and clicking on the \"Run Software\" button. This will build and install the vbox kernel modules needed.\n\nUnity\nThe guest additions is mounted as a virtual CD visible on the launcher:\n\nIn case the system is set up to autorun a CD it should just open the following autorun dialogue (if not select the CD symbol, choose open, then choose Open Autorun Prompt)\n\nAfter having entered your credentials for root access the guest additions will build as seen from the terminal output:\n\nPress Return to close the terminal.\n\n\nNote 1\n  Guest Additions need a reboot of your guest OS to take effect.\nNote 2\n  In some systems the Virtual Box Guest Additions CD icon may not be shown on the desktop, but will be accessible from the Places menu. If the CD still was not there you may have to manually add the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso as a CD-ROM in the Virtual Box Manager Storage menu.  In an Ubuntu host the disk image is in /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso. \nNote 3\n  In some systems (e.g. when running Xubuntu guests) we may not have an Autorun Prompt for the mounted CD. Then we can install the guest additions by opening a terminal on the mounted guest additions .iso to run sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run. In Lubuntu or Ubuntu Server guests we additionally need to install the GNU C compiler (gcc ) and the make  utility in the guest system to be able to compile the guest additions.\nNote 4\n  Running DKMS in the guest OS will keep Guest Additions installed after a guest kernel update. It is not a prerequisite for Guest Additions but if used it should be installed before we install the Guest Additions.\n\n\nInstalling Guest Additions from a Terminal\nIn case Guest Additions are not installed properly we may not be able to boot to the GUI. In this case we need to boot holding the Shift key to access the Grub menu where we access a root shell as depicted in the following question (we do need to mount the filesystem read/write to proceed):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I boot into a root shell?\nThe Guest Additions .iso file needs to be installed on /dev/cdrom from the Virtual Box Manager (see above). We then may install Guest Additions by typing the following commands:\nmount /dev/cdrom /mnt              # or any other mountpoint\ncd /mnt\n./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nreboot\n\n\nRemove Guest Additions\nIn case something went wrong with installing the guest additions, or the guest OS can not boot after installing we may have to remove the additions. This can also be done from a root shell by running an uninstallation script located in the guest /opt directory.\ncd /opt/<VirtualBoxAdditions-x.x.xx>/\nsudo ./uninstall.sh\n\nReplace x.x.xx with your current version of guest additions.\n\nA: Within the guest operating system, install the package virtualbox-guest-dkms.  For example, using the Terminal application, type sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms.\n\nA: For Lubuntu 16.04 users inside Ubuntu 16.04 Virtualbox\nAfter trying many of the main-stream generic instructions I found Lubuntu specific instructions:\nInstall Virtualbox Guest Additions onto a Lubuntu Virtual Machine\nFirst step: Install required software\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install make gcc\n\nNext, use Virtualbox to download the Guest Additions, then select \"Install Guest Additions\" from the Virtualbox menu.\nIf the VBOXADDITIONS cd does not pop up in File Manager, Use File Manager to open the contents of the VBOXADDITIONS cd, then open a terminal there, by going to File Manager's menu and selecting 'Open Current Folder in Terminal'\nsudo sh VBoxLinux*\n\nreboot and enjoy!\n\nA: Here are the manual steps to install VirtualBox Guest Additions kernel modules inside the VM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO file, e.g.\nwget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.20/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.20.iso -P /tmp\n\n\n*Mount the ISO file:\nsudo mount -o loop /tmp/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.20.iso /mnt\n\n\n*Run installer (add -x after sh to debug):\nsudo sh /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nTo find the right version of ISO file, check it at: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/\n\nIf you're using Vagrant, installation is much simpler by following these commands:\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest\nvagrant up\nvagrant vbguest\n\n\nA: The standard \"virtualbox-guest-additions\" package on the .iso provided by Oracle, has general tools for different Guest Operating Systems...  \nHowever, Ubuntu has its own dedicated Ubuntu-specific Guest Addon package(s)...\nnamed virtualbox-ose-guest-dkms and ..-x11 and ..-utils .  \nThese 'virtualbox-ose-guest-*' packages  are DKMS aware.. \"(DKMS is a framework designed to allow individual kernel modules to be upgraded without changing the whole kernel.)\" \nHere is the link to a question I asked 5-6 months ago on this issue... How can I get Compiz to work in a VirtualBox VM\n\nA: If you have the guest additions .iso, mount it in VirtualBox via the guest OS settings. Then start the guest OS and run the vboxwindowsadditions-x86 or amd64 exe.\n\nA: Here are the steps I ran which finally worked, but as user named 'pcworld' stated above it may have been the case that only the last command was actually required. I'll never know, but I want to share in case this helps anyone else:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nAnd don't forget to set your VirtualBox instance to use like 128MB video ram and Enable 3D Acceleration under the \"Display\" settings section for your instance, for good performance.\n\nA: This worked for me for a Ubuntu Server 14.04 guest VM (no GUI):\nEdit: also works with Ubuntu Server 15.04 and 16.04\n1) Install dkms. From the guest run:\nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\n2) From the VirtualBox VM window menu select: Devices --> Insert Guest Additions CD image...\n3) Use blkid to identify the CD-ROM device. From the guest run:\nsudo blkid\n\nOne of the lines in the output should look like this:\n/dev/sr0: LABEL=\"VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.16_95972\" TYPE=\"iso9660\"\n\nThe first part (/dev/sr0) is the name of the CD-ROM device.\n4) Mount the CD (replace /dev/sr0 by the device name found above):\nsudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom/\n\n5) Run the Guest Additions installer:\nsudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\n6) Reboot the guest.\n\nA: The procedure is quite simple. \nIn Virtual Box menu select Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image....\nThe following popup will appear on your Ubuntu desktop :\n\nSelect Run and Guest Additions will automatically be installed.\n\nA: You could also try the following (this worked for me after I had to reinstall the Guest Addtitions after Update Manager killed them). Solution found here:\nhttp://www.unixmen.com/install-guest-addition-in-ubuntu-1010-maverick-meerkat-fix/\nIn summary:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-x11\n\nThis found and updated the correct version of the VirtualBox Guest Additions and my system seems to work properly again, and I'm assuming this will also work if Guest Additions are failing to install from the menu item.\nOne other thing of note. I originally tried to run this under the fish shell - make sure you're using bash (i.e. type \"bash\" into the terminal before you start).\n\nNote on more recent systems, the command has been changed to \nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-x11\n\n\nA: Open Ubuntu in VirtualBox. Open FireFox and go here:\nhttp://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/\nFind your version of Virtualbox and click the link to open it.\nDownload your version of VBoxGuestAdditions (iso):\nOpen it in Archive manager and extract files.\nRun: sudo VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nReboot.\nThis works if you can't open the iso file in VirtualBox (ISO9660 error).\n", "Q: How to upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04?

Gnome and other services try to find all sorts of .files, write to them, read from them and so on. E.g. .ICEauthority. They are not found (yet) because at that moment the home is still encrypted. I do not have automatic login set, since that has known issues with encrypted home in Ubuntu.\nWhen I go trough the following steps, there is no problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*boot up the system.\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1, login.\n\n*run ecryptfs-mount-private\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F7, done.

I have several folders of video files that need to be renamed to something uniform, eg: foldername.videotypexvideonumber.avi. I have looked at creating a shell script to make this easier. The mv command seems to be the best way to do this.\nHowever, every guide/tutorial/manpage I've seen says that when I rename a file I have to also include the file extension. This would normally be fine, but some folders have videos of multiple file types, eg .mkv and .avi and even some .rmvb files.\nSo, what I need to know is if there's a way to rename files through the terminal without having to specify the file type when doing so - basically so that the extension stays the same, regardless of what it is before renaming.\n\nA: It would help to know exactly what you want to do, but you can certainly do this. Learning about BASH parameter expansion is probably pretty necessary.\nDepending on what you what to do, you may need to separate the extension and the filename, or maybe not.\nI'm going to suppose you've already cded into the folder with the files in question. \ncase 1: suppose you want to change the string \"bad\" to \"good\" in every file name; then you can use a simple substitution, i.e., you can do something like:\nfor file in * ; do mv \"$file\" \"${file//bad/good}\" ; done\n(Do make sure that there is no change that changing bad to good will overwrite something already there.) That'll work regardless of extension.\ncase 2: Suppse you need to add \"new\" before the extension, whatever it is, then you can do:\nfor file in * ; do filename=\"${file%.*}\" ; extension=\"${file##*.}\" ; mv \"$file\" \"${filename}new.${extension}\" ; done\nThe extension will remain the same, whatever it was.\nI'd give more advice, but again, I really don't know what you're trying to do, exactly.\n\nA: Quick answer: \nYou can't do that since extensions are part of filename.\nLong answer:\nYou can use a graphical interface to do advanced renames as purrr or gprename\nBUT!\nIn your batch renaming script you can use the following techniques of filename splitting: \nFULLFILENAME=\"/home/user/video/myvideo-release.xvid.128kbps.avi\"\nDIRNAME=$(dirname ${FULLFILENAME})   #-- /home/user/video\nBASENAME=$(basename ${FULLFILENAME}) #-- myvideo-release.xvid.128kbps.avi\nFILENAME=${BASENAME%.*}              #-- myvideo-release.xvid.128kbps\nEXTENSION=${BASENAME##*.}            #-- avi\n\n\nA: [temp] λ = ls\ntest.doc  test.rtf  test.txt\n[temp] λ = for f in *; do mv \"$f\" test2`echo \"$f\" | sed 's/[^.]*//'`; done\n[temp] λ = ls\ntest2.doc  test2.rtf  test2.txt\n\nThere might be a more elegant way to do it but it works\nReplace test2 with anything you want a counter or something.\n", "Q: How to increase the signal power of a wi-fi card?

I can't seem to get a straight answer on this. I would like to add a 3rd display onto my laptop + external monitor setup. While my current setup (Thinkpad X201) has an open VGA port (am using the laptop's display + displayport with external monitor) it appears that I can't drive 3 monitors natively. \nI would like to explore what my alternatives are to get another display into the mix. I've found lots of references to displaylink but nothing absolutely confirmed to work.\n\nA: A user reports it working on Ubuntu 9.04 after compiling some packages: http://mulchman.org/blog/?tag=displaylink \nedit: apt-cache search displaylink returns xserver-xorg-video-displaylink - X driver for DisplayLink devices...it wouldn't be included if it didn't work.

But, there is another (similar) check in\nxf86ClaimFbSlot() (xf86fbBus.c) that, when claiming a frambuffer slot,\nmakes sure no PCI slot has been allocated, I guess thats the reason why\nthe displaylink driven device must be registered first (as primary screen).  \n\nOn another thread the green screen problem is attributed to using DirectFB\ndiscussion here: http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/BNQl8iH957oQe619QVek\nthey indicate that it worked, if slowly.  but the box in question was a 266MHz monster so...\n", "Q: How can I run an executable from a CD when it doesn't have the executable bit set?

Windows can't read EXT4, but there are tools which can.\nExt2Read is a pretty good tool to use.  It has helped me grab files off a non-bootable linux partition in the past. http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/\n\nA: This is probably the simplest most comprehensive guide you're going to get:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5702815/the-complete-guide-to-sharing-your-data-across-multiple-operating-systems\nIn short: \n\nThere is a relatively pain-free Ext2/Ext3 driver for Windows called Ext2Fsd. Just download it and install it like a normal Windows program. When you get to the \"Select Additional Tasks\" stage, check all the necessary boxes for your setup (I chose to check all three). Once you're done, however, you'll get an error message.\n  To fix it, navigate to Ext2Fsd's install location (C:\\Program Files\\Ext2Fsd by default), right click on Ext2Mgr.exe, hit Properties, and check the \"Run as Administrator\" box under Compatibility. Then, double click on it to set up your drive. Double click on your Ext3 drive, click the Mount Points button, hit Add, and select a drive letter for your drive. I chose to create a permanent mount point for the drive so it's always mounted. You can choose whatever you want at this stage. Once you're done, you should be able to browse your Linux drive from Windows Explorer just as you would any other drive.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Since, presumably you wish to access data files, another way to do this is to use an NTFS partition exclusively for data.  As you note, Ubuntu natively accesses such a partition.  Similarly, Windows has no trouble accessing the files either. [grin]  I have used this method for some time on a dual-boot system, and use precisely the same data files with both Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: Reading specific file fails - how to identify the problem?

If it isn't the disk you can look into sar, iostat, hdparm, and dtrace?\nhttp://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/badblockhowto.html\n\nA: It was a problem specific to my setup. I connect my USB hard disk via a USB cardbus adapter, which has two USB ports. If on the other USB port I connect a wireless adapter, my hard disk stops working randomly. So, the problem in my case turns out to be insufficient power supply to my cardbus USB adapter.\n", "Q: Can multiple reboots fix any problems? Maybe I'm wrong but more than once it happened to me that some problems suddenly got fixed after a number of turn-on/turn-off cycles. \nI also read somewhere that this was even recommended in some other OS's (Windows).\n\nA: If a reboot fixes a problem, it's most likely faulty hardware, or a faulty driver for that hardware. Without any more details, it's hard to even guess what hardware or driver it could be.\n\nA: I've certainly had single reboots help. Sometimes my hacking into running services requires a fresh start and that works for me. Kernel upgrades usually need a reboot to take too.\nMultiple reboots only help if the system has to reboot in order to do something  that  in turn needs a reboot to take.\nI have seen this first-hand with Windows but never with Ubuntu. Linux distributions are somewhat better at being able to push system-wide updates from a live session and load them all on the next boot.\nIf you find you need multiple power cycles to get something working, it's probably a sign of a deeper issue.\n\nA: I want to ask which kind of problems can be fixed by reboot?\nwhat I believe is reboot will help to kill unused applications that is run in the background. for example, some time you run an application and you close it this application somehow will still in the process doing nothing if you restart your OS this application will be killed, and that sometime happened with me even in Ubuntu, I close firefox but the process still work.\nIf that what you mean I agree otherwise I don't think so.\nI hope that help\n", "Q: How can I get the Rhythmbox visualization window back in Rhythmbox?

This should isolate \"can't log in with ssh\" issues from \"ssh-copy-id is broken somehow\" issues.\nEdited to add:\nyou can get around some of the issues of not being able to pass any additional arguments  to ssh by creating or adding to a file called ~/.ssh/config:\nHost shortname\n    HostName ec2-0-0-0-0.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n    Port  8882\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nonstandard.name\n    User ubuntu\n\nman 5 ssh_config for details\nWith roughly this setup, I got the script to work by just issuing ssh-copy-id shortname\n", "Q: Indicator Menu Replacement for notification area? I'm looking for a Indicator Menu, that replaces the notification area. Any Systray Icon should be in a Identicator Menu, because on Netbooks the Application Menus and the Systray Icons overlap sometimes\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you are not looking for a menu but for a GNOME applet that will integrate into a panel and display these icons in an expandable menu-like view. There is no such applet that I know of, but you state that you need this in order to solve space problems on a netbook. If so, I'd suggest creating a second panel, moving the \"panel notification area\" (aka systray) there and setting the panel to a small size and autohide somewhere on a screen edge.\nAlternatively, you could also move any other elements from your main panel there -- I generally create an auto-hiding application launcher on the right screen edge where it does not take away space and is easily reachable by \"throwing\" the mouse to the top right corner.\n", "Q: Can't modify files in my shared folder (virtualbox, guest is Ubuntu, host is windows 7) I'm using virtual-box. The guest is Ubuntu. The host is Windows 7. I have a shared folder (shared by the host and the guest).\nThe problem is that in the guest (Ubuntu) I cannot rename/delete/edit the files in the shared folder. For instance, after I edit the file and try to save it I get the following error message:\n\nCould not save the file fileName. Unexpected error: Error renaming temporary file: text file busy\n\nIn the host (Windows) I can rename/edit/delete without any problem. What can I do?\n\nA: You may suffer from bug #34813, where access to shares on Windows systems is broken. Access to files on Ubuntu hosts is not affected.\nTroubleshoot Shared Folders in Virtual Box\nTo investigate if your shared folders are setup correctly you may go through the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Install the latest release of Virtual Box.\n\n\n*Make sure Guest Additions meet your VBox release.\n\n\n*Not define shared folders as read-only if you need write access.\n\n\n*Guest users need to be in the group vboxsf for auto-mounted shares.\n\n\n*Mount temporary shares with option rw and appropriate uid for write access,\n(e.g. sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000 sharename mountpoint)\n\nA: How did you mount that shared folder?\nI had the same problem but with power of fstab I finally manage to freely access my shared folder - just have added the line:\n//shareIP/sharedFolder mountpoint smbfs rw,umask=777,uid=linuxUID,username=winUsername,password=winPassword,auto 0 0\n\nNow you can reboot your OS or just do sudo mount <mountpoint>.\nSomehow with \"native\" vbox sharing I could not achieve this - not even access shared folder although it was visible.\n", "Q: Installed indicators not showing up I have installed a couple of indicators from the The OMG! Ubuntu! Guide to the best indicator applets around.\nFor some reason, however, none of them are showing up besides the sound, e-mail and Dropbox indicators, which were already there.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I think they are regular programs that you have to start manually or make them auto start when you login.\n\nA: hasen_j is right. i had the same problem and figured out that it's a regular application indeed. To try, just hit alt+F2 and type Indicator on the laucher, you'll see your available indicators, start one and it'll appear in the indicators area. put it on the startup applications if you want them to start on ubuntu startup. :) \n", "Q: Are personal settings overwritten during distribution upgrades? For example, in moving from Maverick to Natty, Banshee replaces Rhythmbox as the media player. But if I had installed a player different from either one of these, and uninstalled Rhythmbox, how would the distribution upgrade behave? Would it still install Banshee? What if I simply uninstall and then reinstall Rhythmbox? Will it upgrade to Banshee?\nMonths ago, on the Lucid to Maverick update, I got impatient and made the upgrade a week or two before the final release. At that time, the new Ubuntu font was not implemented, so I downloaded and installed it by myself. When I upgraded to the final version, of course I had the font, but it was not set up as it should have been, with the correct font sizes. I fixed them manually later. I suppose that this happened because the system \"considered\" this to be a personal setting which should not be changed.\nMy main question is: How does the system \"know\" whether I want to use a particular setting as the default, thus upgrading it according to the new version, or if that setting was actively set by me and, in that case keeping it intact?\n\nA: From a technical viewpoint, all the files in your home directory will not be touched during an OS update. This fact contains the answer to your question: Since, under Linux, programs generally store their settings in hidden directories under ~/, the settings will be kept.\nHowever, only retaining the settings does not mean that nothing will change for you: If, during an update, app A is replaced by B , the settings from ~/.asettings will still be there, but there's no program left to work with them. Your \"user experience\" will be that A and everything you configured there are lost, and you'll have to start configuring B instead (or simply install A manually again).\nAnother problem arises when programs change heavily, for example when KDE moved from version 3 to 4. It may well be that a program changed so fundamentally (consider Amarok 1 vs Amarok 2) that the old config files, although still there, are ignored.\n", "Q: What can I change with gtkrc-2.0? We can change breadcrumbs and the sidepane color, but what else can be edited with gtkrc-2.0?\n\nA: You can change the appearance of virtually all widgets, the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file overrides the settings of whatever Gtk theme you are using. For this reason, it usually is best to modify the theme directly (They are located in ~/.themes/ and /usr/share/themes/) or else whenever you change your Gtk theme (System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Themes -> Customize... -> Controls) it will be overridden by ~/.gtkrc-2.0.\nFor more information on Gtk theming, check out the Gtk Theming Tutorial. \n", "Q: Why would a hard disk be invisible to Grub? I just installed a new SSD in my system, and I'm having numerous problems trying to boot from it.\nWhen I try to boot, the boot-loader-loader (Intel Matrix Storage Manager) skips right over it and tries to boot from the second drive. I installed Grub to the MBR on the second drive, pointing it to the boot files on the SSD. Unfortunately, the SSD is invisible to Grub. Running ls from the Grub rescue prompt shows only the second drive. However, if I boot from a LiveCD or flash drive, I can see and mount the SSD. I believe this is a BIOS problem, but I'm still curious.\nHow can my SSD show up in Ubuntu but not Grub? What is the difference between the way Grub finds filesystems and the way Ubuntu does?\n\nA: You are correct that this is a BIOS problem. GRUB (by default) uses BIOS interfaces to access drives, so GRUB will list all drives that the BIOS presents to it. Why your BIOS isn't able to access the drive I can't say, but you have a few options for working around your BIOS's limitation.  \nYou can create a separate partition for /boot, putting it on a drive that the BIOS can read from. /boot contains all of the files that need to be read before the linux kernel is loaded and can use native drivers to access devices rather than relying on the BIOS. Or you can use GRUB's native drivers with grub-install --disk-module=foo /dev/sdX, where /dev/sdX is a drive the BIOS can boot from and foo is one of \"ata\", \"ohci\", \"uhci\",or \"ahci\" depending on how the drive is connected (PATA, different versions of USB 1.0 or SATA respectively). All but \"ata\" require grub 1.99.\n\nA: https://wiki.debian.org/BootUsbWithGrubRescue#fnref-cc4ac999f61993f95475230c2d5041100779799e\n\nUse the nativedisk command to tell Grub to load its native disk and USB drivers\n\nUsing nativedisk, all your USB devices will be detected by GRUB using GRUB's own drivers instead of data from BIOS. Once this is done, you can use ls normally inside the grub> console and all of your USB devices will be listed.\n\nA: I recently installed an SSD of my own and had my share of problems. The eventual solution was to use RAID as the SATA driver in the BIOS instead of AHCI or IDE. Setting up actual RAID disks wasn't necessary.\nThis way, my BIOS correctly recognized all my drives and I was able to boot to Ubuntu from the SSD. This worked on my Abit IP35 Pro motherboard. Might be worth a shot.\n", "Q: Is there a Unity-like global menu applet for gnome-panel? In the top panel of Unity there's the Title of the window, and when it's moused over, a global menu pops up. Is there a similar indicator for 10.10?\nI've found the Indicator Applet Appmenu and Window controls for the panel, but I'm looking for one that works similar to the titlebar/global menu indicator. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The only part that is handled by the indicators is the menus themselves.  The window title and the window controls are all handled by Unity itself.  So to do that specific effect you'd need to write an applet that did it.\nBut, there was something similar done on UNE back when it used GNOME Panel.  You might be able to use the applet there and get some of the same effect.  Or at least start you on your path.\n\nA: I think your best shot is this one: \nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/11/install-gnome2-globalmenu-in-ubuntu.html\n", "Q: Can I change from Mint Lxde to vanilla Ubuntu from the command line or do I need a fresh install? I have installed Mint LXDE 10.04 on my netbook, but would prefer the standard Ubuntu. Would it be easy (one or a few commands) to get the computer to the same state as it would have if I did a fresh install of Ubuntu, or should I just do the fresh install?\n\nA: It won't be easy. Even if they use the same package manager and mostly the same packages there are lots of differences between the two distros, so changing the repositories and doing a dist-upgrade will likely leave you with a broken system.\nDo the fresh install.\n\nA: Linux Mint and Ubuntu use the APT .deb package manager and share repositories.  \nTheoretically it should be possible to move from Mint LXDE to \"vanilla\" (GNOME) Ubuntu. Installing GNOME Ubuntu requires that you install the ubuntu-desktop package, which should then download everything else required. Removing Mint and LXDE may be a little more difficult; you would have to know exactly which packages to remove. The installation of ubuntu-desktop may suggest the removal of some 'conflicting' packages, but may not suggest the removal of everything which should be removed. Mint provides several additional pieces of software which you would have to remove.  \nIt may be easier in the long run to do a fresh install of Ubuntu. If you have partitioned your drive such that you have your /home folder on a separate partition, you could just install Ubuntu to your / partition and preserve everything in /home.\n", "Q: Tasksel cannot be installed I am trying to install tasksel in order to install LAMP but for some reason it always gives me this error:\nE: Unable to locate package tasksel\nroot@TheShop:~# sudo apt-get install tasksel\nReading package lists...

Other than for Windows in Ubuntu there are no fancy utilities provided from printer manufacturers to print photos. I am aware of Gnome Photo Printer and of Photoprint, the first being easy to handle, the latter having more options. However I wonder if there are any other or maybe even better alternatives (including plugins) to perform the following tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print photos in the best photo-resolution the driver offers\n\n*Adjust paper size for standard values of photo papers\n\n*Choose paper tray if the printer has more than one\n\n*Print out multiple photos on one page including mixed sizes (grids)\n\n*Multiple prints with same settings\n\n*Borderless printing if the printer is capable of this\n\n\nAny additional options like pre-processing for color correction or noise reduction would be nice to have but are not so essential.\nAccording to this spec it seems not to so easy to accomplish the simple task of printing photos.\n\nIndeed all applications I have gone through have major drawbacks that make printing photos almost impossible.

Alas, I am not willing to pay $40 for a basic feature I expect to just work.\n\n*Windows: Ooops - everything works fine! But I want Ubuntu to do this!\nAfter half a pack of ink cartridges and half a pack of photo paper cards I am getting tired of testing. At least Gimp and Picasa looked promising but both don't keep their promise when it comes to printing. I'd already be happy to quickly print a few photos with EOG if bug #80220 was fixed - but it's still on \"wishlist\".\n\nA: I just searched for a simple way to print multiple photos on one page and found that LibreOffice Draw was the best application for my requirements.\nYou can select the resolution, the page size and even the individual image size, you can place the images manually or in a grid.\nAll the other programs I tried (including but not limited to: geeqie, gthumb, imagemagick, photoprint, gimp) didn't work for me.\n\nA: F-Spot can make some of the things you are asking for (though not all)\nOn the other hand, and though this is not an answer to your question, but eventually, and hopefully, it will be. There's a project called DarkTable, which is being developed as a substitute of Lightroom. The print interface, however, is still in the list of future features, but it's promising. More info: http://darktable.sourceforge.net/features.shtml\nEdit:\nWhat about gthumb?:\n\n\n*\n\n*Up to 600 dpi\n\n*No standard sizes, but customizable ones\n\n*Paper tray selection in the print dialog (cups, I think)\n\n*Can do grids, but you can't mix grid sizes (you can mix photo sizes, but within the cell grid -meaning they will be adjusted to the cell size, but you can't select each image's size-)...\n\n*Guess you can print several times with same settings (you can't save settings, tho)\n\n*Can't test the borderless, as my printer is not capable of doing such a print :(. GThumb's dialog does allow you to set margins to 0, but I can't test it...\n\n\nTry Geeqie, too...\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlimited dpi\n\n*Same as before, you can customize paper size\n\n*You can't select paper tray (a workaround is print in Postcript, open the .ps file and print with the printer settings dialog customized to your likings)\n\n*You can print images in a grid, too (all cells same size, as before)\n\n*You can keep the settings for several prints\n\n*Again, can't test the borderless printing, but it allows you to set margin to 0... so maybe?\n\n\nHave you tried Digikam? \n\nA: I suggest digiKam software. I think it has most of features one photographer may need.\nGood luck,\n\nA: You can Try showFoto (install it from the software center).\n\nA: Have you looked at shotwell? (I havent looked down through everything so forgive me if it doesnt have what you want)\n\nA: Picasa maybe?\nOrganize\nManage your photos in one place, and find photos you forgot you had\nEdit\nEliminate scratches & blemishes, fix red-eye, crop and more\nCreate\nTurn photos into collages, slideshows and more\nShare \nUpload seamlessly to Picasa Web Albums to share with friends, family & the world\nAnd much more.\n\nA: You can give a chance to the VAP.\nhttp://qvap.ru/screen.html\n\nA: Darktable?\nPhoto enhancement sofware with print option.\nmenus: lighttable - darkroom - tethering - map - slideshow - print\n", "Q: How to access Ubuntu One server side logs for my account? I would like to have info (time, filename, and user when having shared folders) about file changes, uploads, downloads...\n\nA: The syncdaemon.log (in ~/.cache/ubuntuone/log) provides that info too. If you want to have access to server side logs, you should contact U1 team at https://one.ubuntu.com/support/contact/\n", "Q: Repairing after running rm -rf /* I accidentally ran rm -rf /* on my Ubuntu 10.10 and cancelled the command quickly. I was not root and didn't use sudo but a lot of my files were deleted. The system has become less responsive and I am not sure how to fix it. For instance, I reinstalled firefox and it solved many firefox issues but right click is very sluggish. Deluge keeps on pulling up CPU usage (1 core) to 100%. Shutter is also a bit weird in terms of responsiveness.\nIs there anything I could do to repair everything? Like reinstalling every installed package and Ubuntu files?\n\nA: You can use this script to reinstall all your packages, it's a little hackish as I couldn't find the dpkg control mechanism without hacking around in python:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor PACKAGE in `dpkg --get-selections | grep install | awk '{ print $1; }'`; do\n  sudo apt-get --reinstall install $PACKAGE\ndone\n\nSave that to the file reinstall.sh, then execute by running bash reinstall.sh from the command line. This will take a while, but it will reinstall everything.\n\nA: You can make a backup of all your installed packages, then a clean install and then a restore process.\nFirst, from a computer with all the applications preinstalled, retrieve your installed packages list and redirect the output to a file called packages.txt.  Save this package list somewhere so that you can use it for the restore process.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > packages.txt\n\nTo restore all the applications from your list, you must follow a three step process very carefully.\nsudo dpkg --clear-selections \nsudo dpkg --set-selections < packages.txt \nsudo aptitude install\n\nYou will be prompted to install all the new applications in the list.\nAnother example of what this process allows you to do is create a baseline of all the applications after a clean installation of Ubuntu.  Let’s say you would like to remove any applications installed since the clean install, perform the exact same process, and any package not defined in that list will be removed.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > clean-install-package-list.txt\nsudo dpkg --clear-selections\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < clean-install-package-list.txt \nsudo aptitude install\n\nThe very first command of --clear-selections marks all currently installed packages to the state deinstall.  When you restore the list of applications using --set-selections, only packages omitted from the list will remain in the deinstall state.  Aptitude will honor the deinstall state and remove the extra packages, leaving you only with packages from the list. \n\nA: \nI was not root and didn't use sudo but a lot of my files were deleted. \n\nYou most probably have deleted only your personal settings. Create a new user and log in as that user, and check if it's all OK. It should be.\nIf this is the scenario you can move your files and not-missing-config-files to the new user folder.\n\nA: I fixed the issues by doing a fresh install.\nAs @d4n13l suggested, my system had taken a hit in responsiveness and more than just my files were gone.\nI feel like @Martin's approach is something one should go after doing a fresh install for installing previous packages that you had. I had very few of them, so I installed them again from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nThanks to everyone for looking into this. :)\n", "Q: What is the difference between ./ and sh to run a script? I have written a simple script. \nWhen I runsh <myscriptname.sh>, i got the correct output, but when I run ./<myscriptname.sh>, I got an error.\nWhat is difference between when I do sh and ./?\n\nA: The difference you do is, \n\n\n*\n\n*with sh, you're running a program that will interpret the lines in your script just as it you would have typed them on the interactive prompt of the terminal,\n\n*with ./ you're making a shortcut assuming that the script is just right here in the current directory you're sitting in AND it will be executable (because for instance you issued chmod +x myscript.sh), saving you invaluable time for future times :-)\n\nA: When you run any script by passing the filename to the script interpreter program, you are running the interpreter program with the script as an argument passed into it. For example this would look like the process 'sh' with the argument 'filename.sh'. The sh interpreter is opening the file.\nOn the other hand if you run the script itself, the system calls out to the interpreter program specified and feeds in the scripts contents. In this case the process looks like 'filename.sh' with no arguments.\nYou should make sure you have a bang line:\n#!/bin/bash\n# bash script here\n\nA bang line is the very first line in the script and starts with the same two characters #!, these are what the system reads when it tries to execute the script and then the system passes the the script to the program immediately after. Note that this line isn't anything to do with bash and works just as well for python and perl, even though they're very different languages. You would use #!/usr/bin/python for example and then follow it with python code.\nOnce you have your script, make sure you have set execute permissions:\nchmod a+x filename.sh\n\nThen you can run the script as its own process:\n./filename.sh\n\nOr put the file into a known location with a nice program name, like /usr/sbin and run from anywhere:\nsudo cp filename.sh /usr/sbin/program-name\nprogram-name\n\nAnd this is really the practical benefit of using the bang line with the right permissions - it's all about deployment. It's very hard to get users to run a script if they have to remember what program to run the script with. Remember to give a full path to the script every time they want to run it. Where as putting it in /usr/local/bin for example, and making it executable, can save an awful lot of grief for people trying to use your script. These programs then become available to all users on the your computer.\nIt's also good for identification. If you go into the top program, a script run without the bang line will just have the name of the interpreter i.e. bash, perl or python. But if a script is run with the right permissions, then the name of the script shows.\nNote: If you want to distribute a script that's accessible to everyone, then please create a man page and a deb package to install it. We need to reduce the number of random scripts online and increase the number of debs which can be uninstalled.\n\nA: The short version:\n\n\n*\n\n*sh is the command-line interpreter (dash).Running sh my_script makes dash interpret the script.\n\n*./ tries to find out which interpreter to use, by looking at the first line. E.g. #!/bin/bash, or even #!/bin/ruby (as opposed to running ruby my_script).\n\nA: There are three main reasons you might be getting an error:\n\n\n*\n\n*the file is not executable\nrun chmod +x <myscriptname.sh> to fix that\n\n*the partition does not allow running scripts (is mounted \"noexec\")\ncopy the script to /usr/local/bin\n\n*the #! line has an error\nmake sure the first line is #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash\nIf your first line looks right, but still isn't working, make sure the file doesn't have DOS line endings.\nThe error would look something like this:\n$ ./myscript.sh\nbash: ./myscript.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nYou can fix it by running dos2unix <myscriptname.sh>, or if you don't have that,\nperl -p -i -e 's/\\r\\n$/\\n/' <myscriptname.sh>.\n\nA: And the answer is that sh is name for very popular shell. But outdated and replaced by others. Nowadays sh is linked to others shells installed on machine. e.g. I have bash putted there. Running any shell from sh usually trigger some 'compatibility' mode with original 'shell' behavior.\nSo solution is quite simple. Look what's behind sh command (ls -al /bin/sh), and put #!/bin/whatever_you_find_there as first line (or if there is something like that in your script edit it).\nAnd alternatively there may be some bug in script itself. Like dependence that is met by sh, but not interpreter that is actually used.\n\nA: mkdir ~/bin ; cp myscript.sh ~/bin/\n\necho \"export PATH=\"$PATH:/home/$USER/bin\" >> ~/.profile ; source ~/.profile ; \n\nNot /usr/sbin, that's for non-essential administrative tools, /usr/local/bin is a better choice if you don't want to have a ~/bin/, but avoiding sudo as much as\npossible is advisable.\n", "Q: What does the kernel message `CPU0 attaching NULL sched-domain.` mean?

Whenever I am typing in Arabic, the cursor skips to the beginning of the line because if it were written from left to right, that would be where I last typed.\nHow can I fix that?\n\nA: Your software is considering the space character to be ltr and text rtl. In this situation the jumping cursor behavior is correct, at least according these bidi guidelines (section 24 which is ... educational). Thus, you need to instruct your software to insert the space at the correct bidi level.\nFor OpenOffice.org I found these instructions to work, even though they are quite old. In short, go to Tools > Options, select Language Settings > Languages and in Enhanced language support turn on Enabled for complex text layout (CTL). Now you should see the LTR and RTL paragraph icons on the toolbar (to the right of the text justification icons), choose the one that works for your text.\nOther software might not have this setting available (I couldn't find anything for firefox).

If they are being rotated, then you probably have a working anacron, so please check your setup and let me know how it differs from mine.\nThanks in advance, ...\n\nA: Now this is strange, because since Karmic the /etc/cron.d/anacron has looked like this:\n# /etc/cron.d/anacron: crontab entries for the anacron package\n\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n#30 7    * * *   root   test -x /etc/init.d/anacron && /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d anacron start >/dev/null\n30 7    * * *   root    start -q anacron || :\n\nas the job was moved to upstart.\nReinstalling anacron should then do the job (back up your existing configuration first of course).\n", "Q: Gtk warning when opening Gedit in terminal Previously, I need to clear documents history, so I Googled and found this:\nhttp://www.watchingthenet.com/ubuntu-tip-clear-disable-recent-documents.html\nI did the step, and then when I opened gedit in root terminal, I've got this:\nroot@dellph1-desktop:/# gedit\n\n(gedit:8224): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_bookmark_file_load_from_data: assertion `length != 0' failed\n\n(gedit:8224): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to store changes into `/root/.recently-used.xbel', but failed: Failed to rename file '/root/.recently-used.xbel.FP7PPV' to '/root/.recently-used.xbel': g_rename() failed: Operation not permitted\n\n(gedit:8224): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to set the permissions of `/root/.recently-used.xbel', but failed: Operation not permitted\nroot@dellph1-desktop:/# \n\nAnd it's happpened in user terminal:\ndellph1@dellph1-desktop:~$ gedit\n\n(gedit:9408): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_accel_label_set_accel_closure: assertion `gtk_accel_group_from_accel_closure (accel_closure) != NULL' failed\ndellph1@dellph1-desktop:~$ \n\nI really hope someone helps in this case, thank you.\n\nA: Use this\n(nohup gedit 2>/dev/null &)\n\nThis runs gedit in the background in a sub-shell, with nohup. Hence, the error messages are handled by nohup, and closing the terminal wouldn't affect gedit. A simpler way would be:\ngedit &> /dev/null\n\nThis just discards any error messages from gedit.\n\nA: I'm recommending that you not use gedit via the root user. Try and use gedit through sudo instead.\nReinstalling gedit won't help, I believe you need to undo the damage done by following the guide.\n", "Q: What's a good tool for creating .epub format e-books? I have seen a  question here about reading .epub but I would like to create my own easily from a GUI, what is available for Ubuntu? Even if I have to download something outside the repository, as long as it installs easily and works well, I would also like the software to be able to support the use of .svg images and tables.\n\nA: I'm listing a couple of options that I've installed and used. I'm not sure of the extent of svg support, but I believe there is svg import support.  Sigil is the one I'd try first.  ecub is free but not open source.  Jutoh is commercial (though inexpensive if I recall, and it has a trial mode for the first 20 docs), but it might be worth looking at just because of its interesting implementation (not necessarily a knock against it).  It is supposed to be feature-rich, though I found it too slow on my machine at the time.     \nSigil -- A WYSIWYG ebook editor.\nJutoh -- \"epublishing made easy\"\n\nAs was mentioned before, Calibre can also work at bridging formats.

I'm running Virtualbox 4.0.2. It is not virtualbox-ose.\nI'd like the guest OS to have an IP address on my local network so that I can run server software and access this from the host OS.

I have a Windows PC (don't worry, I almost never use it) that sometimes gets used for playing games and audio/video.\nIs there a way I can stream the audio output from that PC over the network to my Ubuntu machine? Both PCs are on the same network, so they can reference themselves directly via their local IP addresses.\n\nA: AirFoil would probably be the best option. It's essentially a plugin for iTunes It's a whole-system audio redirector   that'll let you stream any audio to a whole host of destinations including Linux. It does come at rather a steep cost for a \"utility\" though: $25.\nFailing that you might be able to run a radio-streaming app on your PC (these are ten-a-penny) and pick that up on your Ubuntu machine with a supported player. I'm fairly sure Banshee and Totem can pick up the audio.\nI'm not sure these will handle more than two audio channels (or if that's even an requirement) but start your search with ShoutCast or its GPL brother from another mother: IceCast\n\nA: If you don't mind paying, there's a product called Airfoil made by Rogue Amoeba to do just this. The setup requires an application to be installed on both machines. The Airfoil for Windows application will allow audio streaming to any Airfoil Speaker application (.deb here).\nNote that the Linux application requires mono 1.2.6 or higher, and a full license of the Windows application is not free (currently $25). There is a free trial version available.\n\nA: IceS-ne for Windows (based on ices 0.4 + new features):\nhttp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-search.php?key=ices-ne&pushbutton=Search\n\nA: I've altered a program found on internet and created WLStream. It enables you to stream audio from a Windows output device so Pulse Audio will be able to play it back on a Linux host. The communication between the two is done with plink from Putty. There's a delay in the audio stream caused by the network, I'm sure if you alter the privilege on the TCP packet sent from plink or change your router's configuration as you would for VOIP it'll reduce the audio's stream lag but my research didn't go any further. WLStream can be compiled using Visual Studio 2017 and there's a pre-compiled from the last version here.\n", "Q: How do I run VirtualBox on 2.6.38? I tend to run newer kernels than most people, partially for fun, partially for bug testing, partially for masochistic fulfilment. A couple of days ago I installed 2.6.38-rc1 and VirtualBox's DKMS module would no longer compile.\nI'm not new to VirtualBox throwing spanners in my kernel experiments but is there any way to make it compile?\n\nA: The new Kernel has moved linux/autoconf.h to generated/autoconf.h (hint). I don't really know the technical reasoning for this but anything that includes this in the VirtualBox host module source, needs editing.\nThankfully fixing it is just a case of swapping out the strings:\nsudo find /usr/share/virtualbox/src/vboxhost -name '*.h' -exec perl -pi -w -e 's/linux\\/autoconf/generated\\/autoconf/g;' {} \\;\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nOf course this change might not be permanent in the Linux Kernel. Things could go back and that would squiffy your ability to compile in the future so if you need to do the opposite in the future, here it is:\nsudo find /usr/share/virtualbox/src/vboxhost -name '*.h' -exec perl -pi -w -e 's/generated\\/autoconf/linux\\/autoconf/g;' {} \\;\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n", "Q: How to sync folders selectively across computers? Is it possible to select which folders (outside the ubuntu one folder) are being synced to each machine ?\nFor instance i'd like to sync a data-heavy folder with most of my PC's but not with my netbook.\n\nA: Yes.\nIn 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) you'll be able to use the “Ubuntu One Control Panel” to select which folders to do this in a nice graphical way.\nHowever, the functionality has existed in the backend since at least 10.10. The act of selecting a folder to sync is called “subscribing” the folder, and is distinct from creating / deleting it (which is what is exposed via Nautilus).\nMeanwhile you can access the functionality via u1sdtool: to list all the folders syncdaemon knows about, enter u1sdtool --list-folders; then you use the folder ids listed there to enter the id in u1sdtool --subscribe-folder=folderid (or --unsubscribe).\nThe default behavior is for syncdaemon to subscribe to folders automatically when they are created; you can change this by editing /etc/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf (or ~/.config/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf to do it per user) and add a line udf_autosubscribe = False to the [__main__] section.\n", "Q: Share folder with mac guest on a linux ubuntu host I am trying to share a folder on VirtualBox with a guest OS X, I tried to share the folder through VirtualBox but it doesn't show up in OS X.

Before you see the login screen or between entering your password and getting to a usable desktop?\nIf before, bootchart may help.\nIf after, you should also have a look in the file .xsession-errors for any errors.\nAnd try disabling programs via System->Preferences->Startup Applications and log out and in each time, until you see which one makes a big difference.\nAnother option is the audit subsystem.  Before logging in, switch to a virtual console (e.g. press Ctrl+Alt+F1), then log in, and run auditctl to make it record every process starting and finishing.  Then press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to the graphical login screen, log in, then run aureport to print the information out.\nYou may also be able to put strace -e trace=process > /tmp/startup.log 2>&1 into your startup configuration files somewhere, e.g. edit /etc/gdm/Xsession and change eval exec $command to eval exec strace -e trace=process $command >/tmp/startup.log 2>&1.  Whether Xsession is the right place will depend on when the slowness is happening.\n\nA: In addition to bootchart, which looks to be in the repositories, gnome-system-log is very useful for checking all your system logs.\n", "Q: Can I connect to my company's Exchange server through Kontact?

Also would like to avoid installing GNOME if possible.\nConnecting to Exchange 2010 and I don't have access to change anything on the Exchange server\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Recently I changed from Windows to Ubuntu. I had the same problem.\nAfter a long search I founded DavMail ( http://davmail.sourceforge.net/ ).\nIt is a gateway which transfers all of the exchange messages to your local email client.\nOn the website everything is explained for Thunderbird (I'm using it as well) but maybe it is also possible with Kontact (KMail).\nIf you start using DavMail keep a look on the log-files. It can grow very hard (mine was more then 7Gb before I noticed, I clean these every day now by putting the following in Crontab: \"@reboot > /var/log/davmail.log\" ).\n\nA: Yes it's kinda almost 100% possible.\nRequires latest stable kdepim which is currently kdepim 4.6.1.\nAnything from kdepim 4.6.0/kmail2/kontact2 will work.\nWorks via davmail, nd with akonadi resource davgroupware/davical.\nYou can use the old version to only send/receive email, if that's all you interested in, that's been working for ages. Yes all this requires OWA enabled on server.\nFor me exchange contact sync is working 100% both ways.\nexchange calendar sync is only working from Exchange pushed down to kontact. Not sure why.\nLDAP/GAL lookup is working.\nBe warned, new kontact/kdepim is very buggy still although with a lot of TLC can be made to work nicely. \nYou can also disable davmail log file, so no need to rotate it/clean it.\n\nHOWTO\nDavMail Settings:\nMAIN\n  # what is not specified here is otherwise default\n  OWA: URL to exchange server\n  Trash keep delay (POP): 1\n  Sent keep delay (POP): 1\n  Calendar past events (Caldav): 1\n\nkontact => Mail => Configure KMail => Accounts => Add => POP3 Email Server\nName: Exchange Mail\nIncoming mail server: localhost\nUsername: DOMAIN\\username\nPassword: ThePassword\nCheck enable interval mail checking: 5 minutes\nAdd SMTP server\nExchange\nOutgoing mail server: localhost\nServer requires authentication: check\nUsername: DOMAIN\\username\nPassword: ThePassword\n\nkontact => Calendar => Add Calendar => DAV groupware resource => DAVical => \nName: Exchange Calendar\nHost: 'write anything here, doesn't matter you will edit it later'\nInstallation path: 'write anything here, doesn't matter you will edit it later'\nuncheck use SSL\nClick next, next and finish\n\nThen edit the resource and set the following:\nRemote calendar access protocol: CalDAV\nRemote URL: http://localhost:1080/users/emailaddr@blah.com/calendar/\nUsername: DOMAIN\\username\nPassword: ThePassword\n\nClick Fetch and OK\nRefresh every 30 minutes\nkontact => AddressBook => Add Address Book => DAV groupware resource => DAVical => \nName: Exchange Contacts\nHost: 'write anything here, doesn't matter you will edit it later'\nInstallation path: 'write anything here, doesn't matter you will edit it later'\nuncheck use SSL\n\nClick next, next and finish\nThen edit the resource and set the following:\nRemote calendar access protocol: CardDAV\nRemote URL: http://localhost:1080/users/emailaddr@blah.com/contacts/\nUsername: DOMAIN\\username\nPassword: ThePassword\n\nClick Fetch and OK\nRefresh every 99 minutes\nkontact => settings => Configure Kontact => Contacts => LDAP Server Settings => Add Host\nHost: localhost\nDN: ou=people\nAuthentication: Simple\nPort: 1389\nBind DN: DOMAIN\\username\nPassword: ThePassword\n\nClick OK\nTick localhost\nkontact => Mail => settings => Configure KMail => Composer => Configure completion order => and set LDAP to first\n\nA: I don't know if this might help you pinpoint the solution to your issue, but by default, Exchange 2010 will not connect to any client which is configured to connect using unencrypted connections. If Kontact has an option to encrypt the MAPI traffic (I assume it connects via MAPI like evolution) it might connect. I'm also interested in knowing how a DAV product could connect to Exchange 2010, since the last version to support DAV access was Exchange 2007.\nRegards.\n\nA: Davmail works fine for me with kubuntu natty. I recommend you change the log-file location (I chose ~/.davmail.log) and set all log settings to WARN (not DEBUG) as otherwise the log-file grows incredibly fast.\nTo set-up Kmail/Kontact etc. load up Akonadi configuration and add a resource DAV Groupware. In my case DAVical was the type I required, but the setup was looking in the wrong place by default. I had to change it to http://localhost:1080/*Exchange-subfolder*/\nI can sync my contacts (CardDav) and calendar (CalDav) this way. For mail though, my Uni provides an IMAP server so I use that instead.\n\nA: Davmail will only work if IMAP is enabled on the Exchange server. The only other way is to use Evolution with the evolution-mapi plugin. But as you are saying, you use Exchange 2010, I am not sure, if mapi supports Exchange 2010. \nI am connecting to Exchange 2007 with mapi plugin using Evolution without issues.\n\nA: Davmail will only work if OWA is enabled, not IMAP.  Using OWA, you can connect using either IMAP through Davmail or POP through Davmail.  Using IMAP, you'll not have to bring down the entire email, but just the header information; however, this does take some time when you click on an email to view it, since it will then have to download the email.  POP will bring down the entire email folder to your local device, making it slower to check your email (as it downloads every email to your local directory), but much quicker to view email contents (since it's already on your device).\n\nA: Use IMAP and in there put your companies web outlook URL in there.  Then in username put domain\\username.  Under connection settings choose Authentication and set type as NTLM and hit Auto Detect.  That should give you port but switches Authentication back to Login so switch it again to NTLM and you should be good.\n", "Q: Encrypted home folder - How to home folder after 10.10 reload?

I have run into a problem in that when an ARP request is issued to the device while it is streaming data to the server, the request is ignored, the cache entry times out and the server stops receiving the stream.\nSo, to prevent the server from sending ARP requests to these devices altogether, I would like to add a static ARP entry for each, something like\narp -i eth2 -s ip.of.the.device mac:of:the:device\n\nBut these \"static\" ARP entries are lost if networking is disabled / enabled or if the server is rebooted. Where is the best place to automatically add these entries, preferably somewhere that will re-add them every time the interface eth2 is brought up?\nI really don't want to have to write a script that monitors the output of arp and re-adds the cache entries if they're missing. \n\nEdit to add what my final script was:\nCreated the file\n /etc/network/if-up.d/add-my-static-arp\n\nWith the contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\narp -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.4 00:50:cc:44:55:55\narp -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.5 00:50:cc:44:55:56\narp -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.6 00:50:cc:44:55:57\n\nAnd then obviously add the permission to allow it to be executed:\nchmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/add-my-static-arp\n\nAnd these arp entries will be manually added or re-added every time any network interface is brought up.\n\nA: /etc/ethers\n\nThis file must contain:\nmac    ip-address\n\n\nA: Take a look at the scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d.

Often, crontab scripts are not executed on schedule or as expected. There are numerous reasons for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*wrong crontab notation\n\n*permissions problem\n\n*environment variables\n\n\nThis community wiki aims to aggregate the top reasons for crontab scripts not being executed as expected. Write each reason in a separate answer.\nPlease include one reason per answer - details about why it's not executed - and fix(es) for that one reason.\nPlease write only cron-specific issues, e.g. commands that execute as expected from the shell but execute erroneously by cron.\n\nA: In many environments cron executes commands using sh, while many people assume it will use bash.\nSuggestions to test or fix this for a failing command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try running the command in sh to see if it works:\nsh -c \"mycommand\"\n\n\n*Wrap the command in a bash subshell to make sure it gets run in bash:\nbash -c \"mybashcommand\"\n\n\n*Tell cron to run all commands in bash by setting the shell at the top of your crontab: \nSHELL=/bin/bash\n\n\n*If the command is a script, make sure the script contains a shebang:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nA: If you are accessing an account via SSH keys it is possible to login to the account but not notice that the password on the account is locked (e.g. due to expiring or invalid password attempts)\nIf the system is using PAM and the account is locked, this can stop its cronjob from running. (I've tested this on Solaris, but not on Ubuntu)\nYou may find messages like this in /var/adm/messages:\n\nOct 24 07:51:00 mybox cron[29024]: [ID 731128 auth.notice] pam_unix_account: cron attempting to validate locked account myuser from local host\nOct 24 07:52:00 mybox cron[29063]: [ID 731128 auth.notice] pam_unix_account: cron attempting to validate locked account myuser from local host\nOct 24 07:53:00 mybox cron[29098]: [ID 731128 auth.notice] pam_unix_account: cron attempting to validate locked account myuser from local host\nOct 24 07:54:00 mybox cron[29527]: [ID 731128 auth.notice] pam_unix_account: cron attempting to validate locked account myuser from local host\n\nAll you should need to do is run:\n\n# passwd -u <USERNAME>\n\nas root to unlock the account, and the crontab should work again.\n\nA: Different environment\nCron passes a minimal set of environment variables to your jobs. To see the difference, add a dummy job like this:\n* * * * * env > /tmp/env.output\nWait for /tmp/env.output to be created, then remove the job again. Now compare the contents of /tmp/env.output with the output of env run in your regular terminal.\nA common \"gotcha\" here is the PATH environment variable being different. Maybe your cron script uses the command somecommand found in /opt/someApp/bin, which you've added to PATH in /etc/environment? cron ignores PATH from that file, so runnning somecommand from your script will fail when run with cron, but work when run in a terminal. It's worth noting that variables from /etc/environment will be passed on to cron jobs, just not the variables cron specifically sets itself, such as PATH.\nTo get around that, just set your own PATH variable at the top of the script. E.g.\n#!/bin/bash\nPATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\n# rest of script follows\n\nSome prefer to just use absolute paths to all the commands instead. I recommend against that. Consider what happens if you want to run your script on a different system, and on that system, the command is in /opt/someAppv2.2/bin instead. You'd have to go through the whole script replacing /opt/someApp/bin with /opt/someAppv2.2/bin instead of just doing a small edit on the first line of the script.\nYou can also set the PATH variable in the crontab file, which will apply to all cron jobs. E.g.\nPATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n\n15 1 * * * backupscript --incremental /home /root\n\n\nA: I had some issues with the time zones. Cron was running with the fresh installation time zone. The solution was to restart cron: \nsudo service cron restart\n\n\nA: Absolute path should be used for scripts:\nFor example, /bin/grep should be used instead of grep:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n0 0 *  *  *  /bin/grep ERROR /home/adam/run.log &> /tmp/errors\n\nInstead of:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n0 0 *  *  *  grep ERROR /home/adam/run.log &> /tmp/errors\n\nThis is especially tricky, because the same command will work when executed from shell. The reason is that cron does not have the same PATH environment variable as the user.\n\nA: My top gotcha: If you forget to add a newline at the end of the crontab file. In other words, the crontab file should end with an empty line.\nBelow is the relevant section in the man pages for this issue (man crontab then skip to the end):\n   Although cron requires that each entry in a crontab end  in  a  newline\n   character,  neither the crontab command nor the cron daemon will detect\n   this error. Instead, the crontab will appear to load normally. However,\n   the  command  will  never  run.  The best choice is to ensure that your\n   crontab has a blank line at the end.\n\n   4th Berkeley Distribution      29 December 1993               CRONTAB(1)\n\n\nA: If your crontab command has a % symbol in it, cron tries to interpret it. So if you were using any command with a % in it (such as a format specification to the date command) you will need to escape it.\nThat and other good gotchas here:\nhttp://www.pantz.org/software/cron/croninfo.html\n\nA: I was writing an install shell script that creates another script to purge old transaction data from a database. As a part of the task it had to configure daily cron job to run at an arbitrary time, when the database load was low. \nI created a file mycronjob with cron schedule, username & the command and copied it to the /etc/cron.d directory. My two gotchas:\n\n\n*\n\n*mycronjob file had to be owned by root to run\n\n*I had to set permissions of the file to 644 - 664 would not run.\n\n\nA permission problem will appear in /var/log/syslog as something similar to:\nApr 24 18:30:01 ip-11-22-33-44 cron[40980]: (*system*) INSECURE MODE (group/other writable) (/etc/crontab)\nApr 24 18:30:01 ip-11-22-33-44 cron[40980]: (*system*) INSECURE MODE (group/other writable) (/etc/cron.d/user)\n\nThe first line refers to /etc/crontab file and the later to a file I placed under /etc/cront.d.\n\nA: === Docker alert ===\nIf you're using docker, \nI think it is proper to add that I couldn't manage to make cron to run in the background.\nTo run a cron job inside the container, I used supervisor and ran cron -f, together with the other process.\nEdit: Another issue - I also didn't manage to get it work when running the container with HOST networking. See this issue here also: https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/issues/144\n\nA: Cron is calling a script that is not executable.\nBy running chmod +x /path/to/script, the script becomes executable and this should resolve this issue.\n\nA: It is also possible that the user's password has expired. Even root's password can expire. You can tail -f /var/log/cron.log and you will see cron fail with password expired. You can set the password to never expire by doing this: passwd -x -1 <username>\nIn some systems (Debian, Ubuntu) logging for cron is not enabled by default. In /etc/rsyslog.conf or /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf the line:\n# cron.*                          /var/log/cron.log\n\nshould be edited (sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf) uncommented to:\ncron.*                          /var/log/cron.log\n\nAfter that, you need to restart rsyslog via\n/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart\n\nor\nservice rsyslog restart \n\nSource: Enable crontab logging in Debian Linux\nIn some systems (Ubuntu) separate logging file for cron is not enabled by default, but cron related logs are appearing in syslog file. One may use\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep cron -i\n\nto view cron-related messages.\n\nA: If your cronjob invokes GUI-apps, you need to tell them what DISPLAY they should use.\nExample: Firefox launch with cron.\nYour script should contain export DISPLAY=:0 somewhere.\n\nA: Line written in a way crontab doesn't understand. It needs to be correctly written. Here's CrontabHowTo.\n\nA: Cron daemon could be running, but not actually working. Try restarting cron:\nsudo /etc/init.d/cron restart\n\n\nA: Writing to cron via \"crontab -e\" with the username argument in a line.  I've seen examples of users (or sysadmins) writing their shell scripts and not understanding why they don't automate.  The \"user\" argument exists in /etc/crontab, but not the user-defined files.  so, for example, your personal file would be something like:\n# m h dom mon dow command\n\n* * */2  *   *  /some/shell/script\n\nwhereas /etc/crontab would be:\n# m h dom mon dow user   command\n\n* * */2  *   *  jdoe   /some/shell/script\n\nSo, why would you do the latter? Well, depending on how you want to set your permissions, this can become very convoluted. I've written scripts to automate tasks for users who don't understand the intricacies, or don't want to bother with the drudgery. By setting permissions to --x------, I can make the script executable without them being able to read (and perhaps accidentally change) it. However, I might want to run this command with several others from one file (thus making it easier to maintain) but make sure file output is assigned the right owner. Doing so (at least in Ubuntu 10.10) breaks on both the inability to read the file as well as execute, plus the afore-mentioned issue with putting periods in /etc/crontab (which, funnily enough, causes no error when going through crontab -e).\nAs an example, I've seen instances of sudo crontab -e used to run a script with root permissions, with a corresponding chown username file_output in the shell script.  Sloppy, but it works. IMHO, The more graceful option is to put it in /etc/crontab with username declared and proper permissions, so file_output goes to the right place and owner.\n\nA: Building off what Aaron Peart mentioned about verbose mode, sometimes scripts not in verbose mode will initialize but not finish if the default behavior of an included command is to output a line or more to the screen once the proc starts.  For example, I wrote a backup script for our intranet which used curl, a utility that downloads or uploads files to remote servers, and is quite handy if you can only access said remote files through HTTP.  Using 'curl http://something.com/somefile.xls' was causing a script I wrote to hang and never complete because it spits out a newline followed by a progress line.  I had to use the silent flag (-s) to tell it not to output any information, and write in my own code to handle if the file failed to download.\n\nA: If you edited your crontab file using a windows editor (via samba or something) and it's replaced the newlines with \\n\\r or just \\r, cron won't run.\nAlso, if you're using /etc/cron.d/* and one of those files has a \\r in it, cron will move through the files and stop when it hits a bad file. Not sure if that's the problem? \nUse:\nod -c /etc/cron.d/* | grep \\r\n\n\nA: Although you can define environment variables in your crontable, you're not in a shell script. So constructions like the following won't work:\nSOME_DIR=/var/log\nMY_LOG_FILE=${SOME_LOG}/some_file.log\n\nBIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin\nMY_EXE=${BIN_DIR}/some_executable_file\n\n0 10 * * * ${MY_EXE} some_param >> ${MY_LOG_FILE}\n\nThis is because variables are not interpreted in the crontable: all values are taken litterally. And this is the same if you omit the brackets.\nSo your commands won't run, and your log files won't be written...\nInstead you must define all your environment variables straight:\nSOME_DIR=/var/log\nMY_LOG_FILE=/var/log/some_file.log\n\nBIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin\nMY_EXE=/usr/local/bin/some_executable_file\n\n0 10 * * * ${MY_EXE} some_param >> ${MY_LOG_FILE}\n\n\nA: When a task is run within cron, stdin is closed. Programs that act differently based on whether stdin is available or not will behave differently between the shell session and in cron.\nAn example is the program goaccess for analysing web server log files. This does NOT work in cron:\ngoaccess -a -f /var/log/nginx/access.log > output.html\n\nand goaccess shows the help page instead of creating the report. In the shell this can be reproduced with\ngoaccess -a -f /var/log/nginx/access.log > output.html < /dev/null\n\nThe fix for goaccess is to make it read the log from stdin instead of reading from the file, so the solution is to change the crontab entry to\ncat /var/log/nginx/access.log | goaccess -a > output.html\n\n\nA: Logging Permissions\nA very simple crontab, won't execute because /var/log/ is not writable by luser account!\n* * * * * /usr/local/bin/teamviewer_check >> /var/log/teamviewer.log 2>&1\n\nSOLUTION: create the file as root and chmod to 777\nThanks to the previous suggestion of enabling cron logging in /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf, leads to syslog entry (No MTA installed, discarding output), then thanks to \"(CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)\" error in the syslog installing postfix in local mode, tail /var/mail/luser, /bin/sh: 1: cannot create /var/log/teamviewer.log: Permission denied\n\nA: In my case cron and crontab had different owners.\nNOT working I had this:\nUser@Uva ~ $ ps -ef | grep cron | grep -v grep\nUser    2940    7284 pty1     19:58:41 /usr/bin/crontab\nSYSTEM   11292     636 ?        22:14:15 /usr/sbin/cro \n\nBasically I had to run cron-config and answer the questions correctly. There is a point where I was required to enter my Win7 user password for my 'User' account. From reading I did, it looks like this is a potential security issue but I am the only administrator on a single home network so I decided it was OK.\nHere is the command sequence that got me going:\nUser@Uva ~ $ cron-config\nThe cron daemon can run as a service or as a job.

In my case, just as for that commenter, it was the root user of a DigitalOcean box.\n\nA: On my RHEL7 servers, root cron jobs would run, but user jobs would not.  I found that without a home directory, the jobs won't run (but you will see good errors in /var/log/cron).  When I created the home directory, the problem was solved.\n\nA: The default .bashrc files on UBuntu 16.04 (and many other versions) have a built in mechanism to not do anything if they are not an interactive shell. \nThis can prevent the file from being sourced correctly inside a script that is run by cron! To prevent this, comment out the following lines from the top of your .bashrc file:\nUbuntu 16.04\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nUbuntu 12.04 and some other versions\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\nSo long as these are left in if cron runs a script which sources your .bashrc file you won't actually get any of the environment variables you are used to inside your terminal!\n\nA: Insecure cron table permission\nA cron table is rejected if its permission is insecure\nsudo service cron restart\ngrep -i cron /var/log/syslog|tail -2\n2013-02-05T03:47:49.283841+01:00 ubuntu cron[49906]: (user) INSECURE MODE (mode 0600 expected) (crontabs/user)\n\nThe problem is solved with\n# correct permission\nsudo chmod 600 /var/spool/cron/crontabs/user\n# signal crond to reload the file\nsudo touch /var/spool/cron/crontabs\n\n\nA: Cron daemon is not running. I really screwed up with this some months ago.\nType:\npgrep cron \n\nIf you see no number (i.e. cron's main PID), then cron is not running. sudo /etc/init.d/cron start can be used to start cron.\nEDIT: Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service\nutility, e.g.\nsudo service cron start\n\nEDIT: Also you could use systemctl in modern Linux, e.g.\nsudo systemctl start cron\n\n\nA: Permissions problems are quite common, I'm afraid.\nNote that a common workaround is to execute everything using root's crontab, which sometimes is a Really Bad Idea. Setting proper permissions is definitely a largely overlooked issue.\n\nA: Script is location-sensitive. This is related to always using absolute paths in a script, but not quite the same. Your cron job may need to cd to a specific directory before running, e.g. a rake task on a Rails application may need to be in the application root for Rake to find the correct task, not to mention the appropriate database configuration, etc.\nSo a crontab entry of\n23 3 * * * /usr/bin/rake db:session_purge RAILS_ENV=production\nwould be better as\n\n23 3 * * * cd /var/www/production/current && /usr/bin/rake db:session_purge RAILS_ENV=production\n\nOr, to keep the crontab entry simpler and less brittle:\n23 3 * * * /home/<user>/scripts/session-purge.sh\nwith the following code in /home/<user>/scripts/session-purge.sh:\n\ncd /var/www/production/current\n/usr/bin/rake db:session_purge RAILS_ENV=production\n\n\nA: Crontab specs which worked in the past can break when moved from one crontab file to another.  Sometimes the reason is that you've moved the spec from a system crontab file to a user crontab file or vice-versa.\nThe cron job specification format differs between users' crontab files (/var/spool/cron/username or /var/spool/cron/crontabs/username) and the system crontabs (/etc/crontab and the the files in /etc/cron.d).\nThe system crontabs have an extra field 'user' right before the command-to-run.\nThis will cause errors stating things like george; command not found when you move a command out of /etc/crontab or a file in /etc/cron.d into a user's crontab file.\nConversely, cron will deliver errors like /usr/bin/restartxyz is not a valid username or similar when the reverse occurs.\n\nA: The most frequent reason I have seen cron fail in an incorrectly stated schedule.  It takes practice to specify a job scheduled for 11:15 pm as 15 23 * * * instead of  *  * 11 15 * or 11 15 * * *. Day of the week for jobs after midnight also gets confused M-F is 2-6 after midnight, not 1-5.  Specific dates are usually a problem as we rarely use them * * 3 1 * is not March 1st. If you are not sure, check your cron schedules online at https://crontab.guru/.\nIf your work with different platforms using unsupported options such as 2/3 in time specifications can also cause failures.  This is a very useful option but not universally available.  I have also run across issues with lists like 1-5 or 1,3,5.\nUsing unqualified paths have also caused problems.  The default path is usually /bin:/usr/bin so only standard commands will run.  These directories usually don't have the desired command.  This also affects scripts using non-standard commands. Other environment variables can also be missing.\nClobbering an existing crontab entirely has caused me problems.  I now load from a file copy.  This can be recovered from the existing crontab using crontab -l if it gets clobbered.  I keep the copy of crontab in ~/bin.  It is commented throughout and ends with the line # EOF. This is reloaded daily from a crontab entry like:\n#!/usr/bin/crontab\n# Reload this crontab\n#\n54 12    *   *   *   ${HOME}/bin/crontab\nThe reload command above relies on an executable crontab with a bang path running crontab. Some systems require the running crontab in the command and specifying the file.  If the directory is network-shared, then I often use crontab.$(hostname) as the name of the file.  This will eventually correct cases where the wrong crontab is loaded on the wrong server.\nUsing the file provides a backup of what the crontab should be, and allows temporary edits (the only time I use crontab -e) to be backed out automatically.  There are headers available which help with getting the scheduling parameters right.  I have added them when inexperienced users would be editing a crontab.\nRarely, I have run into commands that require user input.  These fail under crontab, although some will work with input redirection.\n\nA: The script filenames in cron.d/, cron.daily/, cron.hourly/, etc., should NOT contain dot (.), otherwise run-parts will skip them.\nSee run-parts(8):\n   If neither the --lsbsysinit option nor the --regex option is given then\n   the names must consist entirely of upper and lower case  letters,  dig‐\n   its, underscores, and hyphens.\n\n   If  the  --lsbsysinit  option  is given, then the names must not end in\n   .dpkg-old  or .dpkg-dist or .dpkg-new or .dpkg-tmp, and must belong  to\n   one  or more of the following namespaces: the LANANA-assigned namespace\n   (^[a-z0-9]+$);   the   LSB   hierarchical   and   reserved   namespaces\n   (^_?([a-z0-9_.]+-)+[a-z0-9]+$);  and  the  Debian cron script namespace\n   (^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$).\n\nSo, if you have a cron script backup.sh, analyze-logs.pl in cron.daily/ directory, you'd best to remove the extension names.\n\nA: If you have a command like this:\n* * * * * /path/to/script >> /tmp/output\n\nand it doesn't work and you can't see any output, it may not necessarily mean cron isn't working. The script could be broken and the output going to stderr which doesn't get passed to /tmp/output. Check this isn't the case, by capturing this output as well:\n* * * * * /path/to/script >> /tmp/output 2>&1\n\nto see if this helps you catch your issue.\n\nA: cron script is invoking a command with --verbose option\nI had a cron script fail on me because I was in autopilot while typing the script and I included the --verbose option: \n#!/bin/bash\nsome commands\ntar cvfz /my/archive/file.tar.gz /my/shared/directory\ncome more commands\n\nThe script ran fine when executing from shell, but failed when running from crontab because the verbose output goes to stdout when run from shell, but nowhere when run from crontab.  Easy fix to remove the 'v':\n#!/bin/bash\nsome commands\ntar cfz /my/archive/file.tar.gz /my/shared/directory\nsome more commands\n\n\nA: I had a problem with a script that called grep with a regular expression. Some regexs worked when the script was called from crontab while others did not, e.g. [[:print:]] did not work. It turns out that the environment variable LANG has an impact on character sets like [a-z] or [[:print:]]. When I pasted my LANG environment variable into the top of my crontab, i.e. \"LANG=en_GB.UTF-8\", the grep regular expressions all worked fine when the script was called from crontab. HTH.\n\nA: If crontab mentions something like run-parts /etc/cron.daily, then run-parts may be refusing to run your script. In my case the script in cron.daily did not start with #!/bin/sh.\nI discovered this by putting my script in a directory by itself and running run-parts against that directory.\n\nA: This happened to me recently: I had two lines that modified PATH, like this:\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/home/ernesto/bin\n\nThen, later in the file:\nPATH=$PATH:/some/other/path\n\nas one would typically do in a shell-interpreted context. However, $PATH seems to not have been expanded, causing all my jobs to fail. The solution is to put everything on a single line.\nEdit:\nSince I didn't want to wait until the next normal iteration of anacron to verify my jobs worked correctly, I ran:\nanacron -fnd \"jobname\"\n\nWhere \"jobname\" is the job identifier specified in anacrontab. This forces jobs to be run by the same anacron process, sequentially, and without delay.\n\nA: Another Gotcha:\nWhen you type crontab -e and save inside the editor, it won't have any effect. You have to exit the editor for it to add or update according to your changes (e.g. use :x in Vim).\n(crontab -e effectively runs \"edit cron file; update from cron file\" so it's blocking on the editor until you close it.)\n\nA: My crontab only worked when I was logged in as user.\nI found the solution suggested here on Unix & Linux SE\nWhat was the problem is that the scrips were in my home directory which was encrypted. So it will be unmounted and unavailable when I was logged of. You can use the command mount to see if your home directory is mounted for encryption.\nI fixed the problem by putting my scripts in the /usr/local/bin folder.\n\nA: After hours found out the problem where, I was editing the shell script from Windows (notepad++), where the file was originally located in a Linux server and I've missed out the new line character.\nSince I was using Notepad++ to edit the file, I had to do the EOL Conversion to Unix in order to get the new line character, and it worked perfectly.\nHope it helps! \n\nA: Another caveat: \nTry not to put your cron scripts in a user's home directory.\nI just had a problem where everything seemed good, but just after a while - probably a few hours after I log out, the cron jobs stops working, and these messages appear in the log:\nSignature not found in user keyring\nPerhaps try the interactive 'ecryptfs-mount-private'\n\nMy home directory, at least as far as I know, is not encrypted. But still, moving those scripts outside of the home dir solved the problem.\n\nA: I once was working on a shared server with lots of restrictions. \nAll the answers here (PATH, SHELL, bash -c,...) could not get my script to work in the crontab. \nIt did work perfectly when I put the command in a little script file with the PATH, SHELL, and shebang rather than in the crontab itself. I did have to change the permissions to 700.\n\nA: If running scripts within /etc/cron.* directories, make sure your scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*are executable,\n\n*match the Ubuntu/Debian cron script namespace (^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$).\n\n\nSo for example if you've script with extension (such as .sh) won't work.\nTo print the names of the scripts which would be run on hourly basis, try:\nsudo run-parts --report --test /etc/cron.hourly\n\n\nA: I had some issues with using sudo in a cron. \nBasically I wanted to run a command as a specific user and I tested first, at the command line, su, which returned the error This account is not available. Using sudo, the command ran without errors.\nHowever, when running from cron, the sudo command returned the following error: sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo.\nI later found that using runuser and specifing a shell for the command to run, works.\n\nA: Sometimes cron is working just fine but the script or command you want it to run just fails silently, causing you to bark up the wrong tree.\nIn such cases I find it useful to wrap the target within another short script, which outputs some visible debugging code (including output of date) and use redirection to ensure I get some evidence to inspect.  If the target is a script, wrapping around a sh -x can help further.\nThe crontab entry (always edit with crontab -e) could look like this:\n00 14 * * * (sh -x /tmp/my_wrapper_script) >> /tmp/debug.log 2>&1\n\nInspect /tmp/debug.log and its timestamp.  If it's empty, non-existent or the timesamp isn't shortly after 14:00 (in this example) you may have a cron issue, otherwise you need to debug the actual target action and cron is working just fine!\n\nA: You used:\n*  *  * * * DISPLAY=:0 /path/to/your/app\n\nbut it failed because your ~/.dbus directory is owned not by you but by root.  Check it:\nls -l ~/.dbus\n\n\nA: Crontab Permissions\nThere are two files that control the permissions for crontab: /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny. If there is a cron.allow file, then the user or users that need to use cron will need to be listed in the file. You can use cron.deny to explicitly disallow certain users from using cron.\nIf neither files exist, then only the super user is allowed to run cron.\nWell, that depends on the system specific configuration to be exact. Most configuration do not allow any users to run jobs, while some systems allow all users to run jobs by default.\n", "Q: Unsubscribe Ubuntu One Folder doesn't work I have two system and a handful of synced folder (all outside the u1 folder).

I have a media/file server running Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, connected via cable directly to a DSL router, which also acts as a network switch.\nThe router uses DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses. I'd like to keep it as such, if possible. I have friends come in and it's easier for them to connect.\nFrom my desktop (Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx) I connect via wireless to the router. I can ping the media server and ssh into it using it's IP, but it fails when I use the hostname.\nWhen I ping and ssh wirelessly from my Netbook (Crunchbang Linux), it strangely enough works using the media server's hostname.\nThat said, I believe it may not be a router configuration issue, but something on my desktop I have to configure.\nI tried turning off the firewall, on both sides (sudo ufw enable/disable).\nWhat else can I check or try? Thanks :-)\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install winbind\nYou probably want to add 'wins' where it says \"hosts:\" in /etc/nsswitch.conf\n\nA: You can also sudo apt install samba\nThis has an auxillary result of making the hostname available across the LAN.\nInstructions on ubuntu.com\n\nA: If you can set up the machines to receive the same IP address every time, for example by using the MAC address in the router, or if you can set up static addressing on each machine, then you can create a hosts file that will enable the functionality.\n# sample /etc/hosts\n#\n127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain   localhost\n::1     localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6\n\n192.168.1.1 router.example.com  router\n192.168.1.201   machine1.example.com    machine1\n192.168.1.202   machine2.example.com    machine2\n192.168.1.203   machine3.example.com    machine3\n\n\nA: Using hostnames requires the name service resolution to be properly setup, since you are using DHCP that should be automatically managed by your router.\nCheck /etc/resolv.conf (it contains the DNS configuration).\n", "Q: Online folder ordering different than my PC? The folders are shown online (by web browser) sorted by Capital letter first then by lower case. This is not the case with Nautilus 2.30.1. For example;\nonline:    Apple Frog Mat bean cool dog\nnautilus:  Apple bean cool dog cool Frog Mat\nThis makes it difficult to cross reference.\n\nA: Apparently Ubuntu's version of Nautilus is intended to sort case-insensitive, contrary to most linux application defaults. A google search brought up a thread that I believe holds your solution:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=34699\n\nI have since done a lot of digging around... and found the real source of the problem.  Nautilus (and ls) uses the computer's LOCALE settings to determine how to sort file/directory listings, in particular, the LC_COLLATE variable. By default, and for whatever reason, Arch overrides the preferred language settings by inserting its own LC_COLLATE variable in /etc/profile:\n  export LC_COLLATE=\"C\"\n  Simply commenting this one line and restarting the computer will set LC_COLLATE back to the encoding specified by LOCALE in /etc/rc.conf.  In my case, en_CA.utf8.\n  My files and directories are now sorted alphanumerically case-insensitive\n\nIn your case, I think you want LC_COLLATE=\"C\" instead.\nI also found this relevant askubuntu post:\nNautilus sorts the Name-column \"mysteriously\".

I had Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 \n160 GB HDD, 1GB RAM,INTEL DUAL CORE\nOne of my friend told that UBUNTU is also a better OS and is an open source programme and u can use alternately both Ubuntu or VISTA,\nso I downloaded the disk image for Ubuntu 10.10 and burned it on a CD.\nI played it first on Windows Vista so it asked some 3 options of that I chose an option which downloaded Ubuntu Cd helper ,then I selected the first option something 'demo and install' it said to reboot the computer I reboooted it by selecting option reboot now and finishing it,after the computer was restarted.it asked me options for selecting Ubuntu or Windows Vista,I selected Ubuntu, I saw ubuntu is started which was the least time I could see a new Os is started, then I tought I should install it.\nAfter selecting install it ,there came an option to drag  option window's vertical line to right or left to increase or decrease the partition for ubuntu  and on another side where something 'NTFS' was written I thought it must be for windows I dragged Ubuntu to maximum(5.23GB) left 37.3 GB for NTFS dev and I continued forward, left it for some process going on, the ubuntu was installed I think ,it also asked for some softwares to be installed I let them be installed and let all process finish after looking some features of Ubuntu.\nI wanted to go back to windows vista but when I restarted computer it didn't asked me an option for selecting OS 'Ubuntu' or 'Vista' as it had asked me before. it directly started Ubuntu and asked for same options of software to installed ,I removed the CD and Tried again but still I couldn't see anything for Vista,when I checked properties of 'File System' it was written that 2.3 GB is covered and rest 157 GB is free,\nI am scared that I have deleted all the data of Vista and Vista OS too,Can I get my VISTA BACK?,it is ok if I don't get anything of Ubuntu,I had many of important files too in my vista.is really my pc been formatted completely,?\nfrom last week I am searching for its solution on Internet I am frustrated a lot, many of the contain particular solution but for before versions of Ubuntu,I just want My vista and vista files back .One of the solutions also contained inserting DVD of vista and some procedure but my DVD player isn't working but CD player is working.I hope some of my Internet friends come to me as a saviour please.\nAnd one note I don't know what is GRUB or all other stuffs as I am knowing very bit of installing OS.\n\nA: If you had really important files in your Vista partition, then stop doing anything. If you had erased your files, each time that you write to you're disk recovery will be harder. Go to some professional that can help you to recover the files.\nIf the files are not so important, i.e. you don't want to pay to recover them, the first thing to do is to know what exactly had happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Please insert the Ubuntu CD again and boot your computer.\n\n*When asked choose to Try Ubuntu (not install it).\n\n*When Ubuntu has finished loading, go to the System Menu-> Administration->Disk Tool\n\n*Please give us the info from that screen. Specially the layout in the right side.\n\n*If you hit the Print Scrc key, it will take a screenshot of the screen. If you can post it here it could be very helpful.\n\n\n\nNote that this is not really an answer, but this is too many information for a comment. It's likely that askubuntu is not the best place for this kind of problem.\n\nA: After looking at this image, seems like you have deleted your Vista partition.\nYou will need to run some specialized software to recover your files. I have found a nice tutorial. I have in the past get great results with foremost recovering data from damaged disk. Take a look at the tutorial.\nAfter you had recovered your data you will need to reinstall Vista. To be able to do it you will need a CD or DVD with it. It's possible that you're computer included such a disk. If you don't have it, you should be able to get it from the manufacturer (usually with a cost) or download it from the net (caution: this can be illegal on some places even if you have paid for your windows). Installing Vista is quite of the scope of this question, and it can overwrite your Ubuntu install (you can avoid it if you're careful). Look for some tutorials in the net, and make a copy of all your important files in Ubuntu before starting.\n---Following---\nAfter recoveting the partitions you should be able to open them from Ubuntu. Go to the Places Menu and you should be able to see an item there for the partitions. Click on it and copy all the important files to some other place, like a USB disk. Then you should reinstall Vista. It's nearly impossible to recover the old installation, as it's too likely that some vital files for the SO are corrupted.\n\nA: It sounds like you used WUBI to install Ubuntu in a dual boot configuration with Vista. It also sounds like you resized your existing NTFS partition to make space for Ubuntu. \nAs it doesn't ask to choose which OS to load, perhaps the boot loader (GRUB) did not install, do you remember that step, and what you chose? The default values would install GRUB in the MBR.\nWUBI has an option to install without repartitioning, and probably recommended for newbies, but let's see what we can fix. \nCheck if you still have your Vista partition\nIn Ubuntu, press ALT+F2 (both at the same time) and run gnome-terminal, then enter this command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt will list all the drives in your PC, and their types. Check for a NTFS type partition. \nYour options\nYou could update GRUB so that it recognizes both Ubuntu and Vista again. From the gnome-terminal, update grub with this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should force grub to rescan for other OS's and add them to the menu. If it does not find Vista, then the Vista partition has something wrong.\n(more info on this here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto)\nFinally, you can boot with a Live CD and backup your files from Vista, and then reinstall Vista. There is a guide here on recovering data.\nAlways read the instructions and pay attention to the details! Accidents like this can easily happen if you just plough ahead\n", "Q: Revert audio configuration to defaults I messed up the audio on my 10.10 installation. I had a problem of having no sound when plugging in the headphones and following many different solutions for that problem I (de)installed several packages. Now I have no sound at all.\nI don't want a solution on how to fix my headphone problem. I just want to reset all audio-related setting and packages to the after-installation state (where at least the speakers were working).\nI found several places where it is said that there is no global reset-to-after-installation possibility. Or that on could use apt-get clean, but even if this would remove all non-standard audio-packages, I don't know which packages I would have to install in order to get the standard audio-packages.\n\nA: It may well be that in your case only a minor component of the sound system (mainly ALSA and pulseaudio) is missing that could be reinstalled or reconfigured easily. To tell this you should exactly know what you have done, what you have removed and what you may have installed as a replacement. From what you write in your question this unfortunately seems not to be the case.\nWhat to do if we removed all or part of the sound system?\nRestoring the sound system would in theory be possible by reinstalling all sound related packages including their default system wide settings, but to my experience a fresh install of Ubuntu is much faster, safer, and easier. Take care to keep your settings and data in your /home directory untouched. You may have to reinstall some additional packages but you will see that even these will have kept your individual settings from your untouched /home.\nIs it only a wrong user setting?\nIf you only changed settings and configuration files but did not remove packages there may indeed be a good chance to recover your system. You can easily find out if your sound problems come from a wrong user setting or from system wide settings by looking at sound in the guest account or by creating a new user account. In case this new user has sound you will find all default settings in the new user's /home. In some cases wrong pulseaudio settings in a user's home can be removed by renaming/deleting ~/.config/pulse (~/.pulse in older releases).\nmv ~/.config/pulse ~/.config/pulse.old\n\nOf course this will not help when system-wide settings are broken.\n\nA: I'm here because I assumed the entire machine would use the same audio settings in /etc/pulse. That always worked in the past. I never imagined ~/.config/pulse would generate itself without my knowledge, with busted settings that sound horrible. Seems like a bug.\nIn any case, the accepted answer is a little confusing. Here's what I recommend, four steps:\n\n*\n\n*Check or add your settings at the bottom of /etc/pulse/default.pa for example, maybe you want to activate load-module module-echo-cancel\n\n*cd ~/.config\n\n*mv pulse pulse-old Hide the broken config, so pulseaudio can't find it.\n\n*pulseaudio -k Kills pulseaudio and it restarts automatically.\n\nThis should bring back your systemwide settings!\n\nA: Synaptic has got a history function, but would probably take hours and hours to \"undo\" the changes. And wouldn’t be guaranteed that it works afterwards\n\nA: I used Ubuntu for about 3-4 years.\nIn my opinion, just try loging in as root user and open any audio/video file. Check your headset now. If it works, just login into a normal account again. The problem might have been fixed. It worked for me twice. Sometimes my headset port has these difficulties. Try this.\n", "Q: XFCE shortcut problem Every time, when i hit k button in a terminal window in vim, so it happens fairly often, it invokes the Find pop-up. I could not find where this can be turned off.\nI do not have this problem at home where I also run 10.10.\n\nA: That should be either a function of the window manager or the terminal emulator.  You didn't say which terminal emulator you are using, but most have menus to handle keyboard shortcuts.\nFor the window manager, click on the Xfce icon on your panel (has the X with the mouse), then go to Settings > Keyboard and click on the \"Application Shortcuts\".  You can remove the shortcut with the \"- Remove\" button.\nIf you do not see the entry listed there, then it is likely the function of the terminal emulator.  Let us know which emulator you are using and we can give more info for you.\n\nA: I had similar problem for days. \nWhen I pressed \"B\" key while writing commands in terminal, set title dialog appears. It was so boring. \nFinally I realized the problem. It's because of \"Editable Menu Accelerators\". I hovered the related menu item (in this case Set Title) and changed the shortcut from \"B\" to another combination. \nBackspace removing the sortcut.\nFor more: http://docs.xfce.org/faq#editable_menu_accelerators\n", "Q: Weird glitches in Inkscape rulers I have a weird glitch when working with Inkscape.

Apparently it's fixed in version 0.48.1.\n", "Q: Can I safely add secure login to a bootable usb created from a live cd I created a persistent usb installation from a 10.10 live cd using the \"Boot Multiple ISO\" utility and their \"PDL Casper-RW\" creator.  I really like it, have made several changes to the install, and now find myself using it on the go more than I expected to. I would like to add a password and force login to the default user to add a little security. Is there anything unique or special about the Live-CD environment that would prevent this or make it difficult. If not what is the easiest way to do it so as not to miss something and break my stick? \n\nA: As far as I know, the LiveCD environment is not meant to be changed so much. Yes you can add files, as in the persistent data storage portion. However, most of the programs and files are kept in a squashfs file system, which does not easily allow any change. I can't remember whether the configuration files and password files would be in the persistent storage or the squashfs system.\nThe LiveCD environment, although it is faster, doe snot easily allow changes of programs, or even update thereof. When you update a deb file, it is actually ADDED to the persistent storage portion of your disk.\nWith my experience of the USB-based Linux installations, I would rather have a full installation of Linux on a USB disk, from which I boot, just as if it was an external hard disk over USB. I then have a full access to all the files in an ext4 file system, for example, and I easily can replace any file I want, be it program, DEB module, data or config. It is a bit slower, but better if you plan on using it on a regular basis, not only to deo some boots here and there.\nIf you want to go ahead with a full installation, you just have to remember that the GRUB must be installed on the right device (/dev/sdb, for example, NOT SDA), and it should be the master boot record of the disk, not the partition. Also I found with experience that not all USB keys are created equal. Some are giving me more headache than others. \nMake sure you have a good backup of all data files you have on your computer internal hard disk before proceeding. I overwrote the boot record of my hard disk once, and it was once too many. I learned the lesson. \nUPDATE:\nSince Linux use swap file partition, you should manually partition the USB key you use, and have no swap partition. Because of its nature, a swap partition will cause too many read/writes on the USB key, which may shorten the lifetime of the key on this part of the storage area, eventually causing problems.\n", "Q: Mounted drives appearing twice in lists I have mounted a couple of network shares with my etc/fstab file - it works great, just like it's supposed to, but unfortunately every mounted drive keeps appearing twice!\nWhen clicking one of the duplicates, an error is shown; Unable to mount: [mountname].

You can install the additional pulseaudio utilities:\nsudo apt-get install paman padevchooser paprefs pavucontrol pavumeter\n\nCheck the input tab in pavucontrol and make sure its not muting your mic. You can also play with the configuration tab in case that is wrong, but note your initial setting first.\nKeep in mind what arochester and Joao are saying, make sure pulseaudio is selected in the skype audio options.\n\nA: I have an Acer Aspire netbook and had exactly the same problem - microphone worked for recording, would not work with Skype, only PulseAudio input available on Skype so I couldn't manually provide the microphone name.\nAbsolutely weirdly what worked for me was to go to my PulseAudio volume control for the input on the microphone and make sure my left and right channels were not at the same level.

When I changed it in Recording Tab it resolved my issue. Good luck!\n\nA: I had issues on some laptops where Skype would not use the internal microphone, but rather use the microphone input jack. Check the options dialog in Skype if there are multiple microphone choices and try different ones.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my Samsung N150 Plus netbook using 11.04. I found that my sound preference settings had changed after a reboot or update. \nOn my system the internal or external mic's do not register at all in the 'Input' tab of 'Sound Preferences' unless the profile setting in the 'hardware' tab are changed from 'analog stereo output' to 'analog stereo duplex'. Once the profile is set to duplex, I can see the internal mic and any external mic's I plug in on the 'input' tab and it works fine assuming nothing is muted and volumes are correctly set.\n\nA: Just would like to confirm what glenatron said. I have acer aspire netbook and with the same issue with skype on ubuntu.  I tried putting the right and left mic channels at different levels as glenatron said but they would always move together.  This was solved when I clicked on the padlock icon which locks/unlocks the channels together. I was then able to slide one channel independently of the other and the mic now works with skype. Exlpanation? Not sure but it seems since my acer netbook has only one mic input point, putting the too channels on the puvacontrol at same level may have created some conflict or sent inaccurate signal.\n\nA: If lsusb shows your USB device is present, make the USB microphone the preferred device in system settings.\nSystem Settings > Multimedia > Phonon > Audio Recording > Recording > Prefer (until the USB device is listed first)\nThat worked for me and Skype.\n", "Q: DVD-RW disc not recongnized Initially there was data on the disc and Ubuntu recognized it.

How do I do that.\n\nA: Try setting the users password as root user i.e \nsudo passwd user-name\n\nI just tried it and set my password to \"a\"\nadnan@adnan-ubuntu-vm:~$ sudo passwd adnan\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\nadnan@adnan-ubuntu-vm:~$ \n\n\nA: sudo pam-auth-update --force\n\nNavigate to passwdqc password strength enforcement and click ok to save the change.\nNow you can set the password to whatever.\n\nA: If you have created the user and you want to give security code to your account then just try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal.\n\n*Write passwd on terminal.\n\n*Now enter the password.\n\n*retype the same password as above.\n\n\nI hope it works for you!!\nThank you!!\n", "Q: How to list currently not installed packages? I'd like to output a list of all currently not installed packages (they are visible in Synaptic for example) using only shell commands. How do I do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: This should be it:\naptitude -F %p search '!~i'\n\nThis will list all packages currently not installed (including virtual packages and packages that have only their configuration files installed). If you don't want virtual packages (that's what Synaptic shows as Not installed), extend the search pattern to:\naptitude -F %p search '!~i!~v'\n\nYou probably need to install aptitude, as it's no longer part of the default installation as of Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: This isn't fast, but it will work:\napt-cache pkgnames | xargs -i1 dpkg-query -f '${Package}\\n' --show '1' 2>&1 | perl -lne 'if(/matching (.*)$/){ print $1 }'\n\nWarning: This prints all packages, even meta-packages and virtual packages.\n", "Q: Resizable screen mode for VirtualBox behaves strange with Ubuntu as guest I have Ubuntu both as guest and as host. I use VirtualBox 4, just downloaded from the official repository. After installing the guest extensions, I got this strange problem:\nWhen I activate the resizable screen mode with Host + C, the GNOME desktop won't resize with the screen. Only the wallpaper gets stretched. I use no desktop effects and haven't changed any driver options yet.\nAny ideas how to fix this? Here is a screenshot of the guest machine, demonstrating how it looks like after changing the resolution:\n\nI know how to use scalable mode, but I guess I forgot some configuration in the guest machine to make it work.\n\nA: Virtual Box Scaled Mode (Host+C)\nVirtual Box has the option to run in \"scaled\" mode. This means that any screen size will be enlarged or reduced by the same factor as the host windows size changes. The scaling also effects desktop elemets that may be rendered distorted then:\n\nVirtual Box Non-Scaled Mode (Host+A)\nWhen Guest Additions are installed (see this answer), and only then, we are also able to fit the guest desktop to an altered host windows size. Desktop elements will then be rendered correctly to fit into the virtual desktop size.\n\nPressing the key commands switches the given feature on or off.\n", "Q: I would like to create a log of all commands typed in terminal I would like to have a log of all command that are typed on the terminal.\nI have check \"script\" but this generates a file with the commands and the responds all together. Is there a way to have the commands only?\n\nA: Everything a user types into the terminal by hand is saved into ~/.bash_history, where ~ is shorthand for the currenly logged in user's home directory. Note also that files beginning with a . are hidden; in Nautilus, you can show them by hitting Ctrl+H.\nTake a look at it by typing\ncat .bash_history\n\nTo view your history, annotated with sequential numbers, type\nhistory\n\nYou can execute commands you see there again by typing !2129, for example, which would execute command number 2129 as shown by the history command. \nNote that the history command shows you up to the second logs, wheras .bash_history is only saved after you log off from the terminal.\nLittle piece of interesting information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Commands that begin with a space are not saved to .bash_history. If you run a command like rm -R mydir/, you may want to prefix it with a space to prevent accidentally running it again by hitting the up-arrow.\n\n\nAs Joāo says, the size of the saved history can be controlled with export HISTFILESIZE=5000.\n\nA: If you are using the defaullt shells all the commands are already logged to $HOME/.bash_history .\nThere are several environment variables which affect the history keeping, you can read about those with:\ninfo bash\nType: / HIST\n\nIf you want to apply the setting to all users edit /etc/profile.\nExample:\nexport HISTFILESIZE=5000\n\n\nA: You can also use CTRL+R in the terminal to search your history.\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL+R\n\n*enter search terms (e.g. type 'sudo apt-get')\n\n*press CTRL+R to cycle through each match\n\n\nA: If you mean you want a log of all commands you run in an interactive shell, see BashFAQ 88 - How can I avoid losing any history lines?\n\nA: I wrote a function for this:\nfunction begin_install_log() {\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]\nthen\n    echo \"No arguments supplied\"\n    HIST_NUM=\"\"\nelse\n    HIST_NUM=$(history|tail -n 1|awk '{ print $1  }')\n    HIST_NUM=$((HIST_NUM + 2))\n    OUTPUT_FILE=$HOME/environment/ansible/.install_cache/${1}\nfi\n}\nfunction capture_install_log() {\nif [ ! $HIST_NUM ]\nthen\n    echo \"run 'begin_install_log' first\"\nelse\n    history|grep -A999 $HIST_NUM|awk '{$1=\"\"; print $0}' >> $OUTPUT_FILE\n    HIST_NUM=\"\"\nfi\n\nUsage:\n$ begin_install_log some_file_name\n$ blah\n$ blah\n$ blah\n$ capture_install_log\n\nYou will of course have to change the OUTPUT_FILE variable to suit your needs.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Comprehensive book on Kile Finally, I have decided to migrate from Office to Latex. That is why I have chosen Kile as an editor, for many reasons. \nThat's why I need a comprehensive book or would be even perfect if there is a video training course on Kile. The reason is that I have never worked with it before. \nCould you help me to choose a good starting point on learning Kile,please?\nThank you.\n\nA: If Kile's interface is what you're interested in, then its online documentation is a good starting point. You can find it on Kile's sourceforge page.\nIf, however, you'd like to learn more about LaTeX itself, then I highly recommend the LaTeX companion (available on amazon) or, available online, the Not So Short introduction to LaTeX (1).\n", "Q: How do you resize a live partition? I saw the question : Is it possible (aka safe) to resize a partition while the system is running?\nShort answer : yes, but they don't explain how.  How do I resize my partition while the system is running.  Gparted doesn't offer me other option that mouting the partition.\nThanks\n\nA: It is filesystem and partition dependant, different flesystems and partitions will use different methods. AFAIK it's usually used on lvm partitions. If you are using Gparted, the safe thing to do is to umount it first.\nUsually you use lvextend and resizefs in lvm partitions. You can find more info on their man pages. Again it's not a good idea to do with \"normal\" partitions.\n\nA: First you have to expand the underlying block device.  If you are using a conventional partition on a single hard disk, this is not possible.  LVM and mdadm can expand the block device, then you can run resize2fs to expand the fs ( assuming it is ext[234] ).\n\nA: It really depends on the filesystem you are using but in most cases the answer is to use a livecd (Since it comes with gparted) but it is highly NOT recommended to resize a mounted, usable partition.\nPlease note that (at the time I'm speaking ubuntu 11.10 \"Gparted 0.8.1\") Gparted  can't manage partition in the LVM it self...\n", "Q: How should I display units in my application? There is inconsistency in how various operating systems display file size units.  Windows shows base 2, MacOSX shows base 10.  Does Ubuntu have guidelines for this?\n\nA: Ubuntu does have a policy for this.  The basic gist is as follows:\nUse base-10 for network bandwidth (e.g. 6 Mbit/s or 50 kB/s) and disk sizes (e.g. 500 GB hard drive or 4.7 GB DVD).  When using base-10, follow the SI standard for prefixes (e.g. kB, MB).\nUse base-2 for RAM sizes (e.g. 2 GiB RAM).  When using base-2, follow the IEC standard for prefixes (e.g. KiB, MiB).\nThere is the library libkibi, available starting with Ubuntu 11.04, that provides helper functions for formatting sizes appropriately.\n", "Q: Google Talk Plugin in GMail on MacBook 2,1 I'd like to use the chat section in GMail to make phone calls.

In the GMail chat settings, I've tried selecting \"Default Device\" for the microphone, as well as \"Internal Audio Analog Stereo.\" No matter which setting I try, none seem to work. \nAs I said at the top, this is only a problem in Ubuntu; it works just fine in OSX and Windows (which means that yes, my Google Voice account is properly configured).

However, FUSE virtual filesystem mounts are one of the rare exceptions.  FUSE virtual filesystems are normally restricted to the user who mounted them.\nIn this case, the gvfs-fuse-daemon command (run as part of your desktop session) created this mount, belonging to you, and no-one else can access it, including root.\n", "Q: Shortcut for Resolution Change using NVIDIA Back several ubuntu versions ago I could resize the screen using Ctrl + Alt + - (For higher resolution) OR Ctrl + Alt + + (For lower resolution).\nNow they do not seem to work. How can I add them again for resolution change.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this feature is gone since Bullet Proof X. However:\nYou can create short cuts (System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts) to change your resolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a look at System → Preferences → Monitors to see your available modes, in my case there are four, from 640×480 up to my native resolution\n\n*You can now use xrandr -s 0 to xrandr -s 3 to change to one of them.\nIt's not exactly the same as the old +/– business, but it works rather well.\nTo add a short cut, in the Keyboard Shortcut settings, click add, choose a name, like 'First Resolution', a command like xrandr -s 0, and hit Apply. Then click the short cut cell, where it says Disabled and press, for example, Ctrl+Shift+Alt+0 (my preference).\nNote: this works on any graphics card, not just NVidia's. \n", "Q: Is there any way of changing the font size of the tabs in Chromium?

I got the standard messages saying that .ICEauthority could not be updated, nautilus could not be started and 'There is a problem with the configuration server. (/usr/lib/libgconf2-4/gconf-sanity-check-2 exited with status 256)' [This was copied from internet, I do not know if the versions and status number make up but it was at least an error message involving gconf-sanity-check-2]. So I found that people had gotten the same problem when installing veetle so I assumed veetle was the cause of the problem. What I did was to remove vlc (because this should fix the issue, according to different threads). When removing vlc I got an \".ICEauthority\" file (it was not there earlier) but still no desktop. This apparently was because of some permission issues so I ran chown alpha:alpha /home/alpha which made the trick - and here I am.

Can you expand on what the problem was and how you solved it?\nAnyway, changing wrapped-passphrase's group from root to alpha won't make any difference, as the group doesn't have any permission.\n\nA: This answer may be a little bit late, but I just encountered a very similar problem, and found a simple fix. Check the permissions of the .Private directory under /home/.ecryptfs/[user]; the mode should be 700. I'm not sure that mode 700 is exactly correct, but when the problem occurred for me, I found that the executable bit for that directory was not set, and I expect that's what prevented mounting the decrypted home directory. Of course the directory owner should be correct as well, but in my case it was.\nFor me, somehow the directory permissions had changed \"spontaneously\" while my home directory was mounted. I find that quite troubling, but at least I know what to do to fix the problem easily should it occur again.\n", "Q: Wireless Driver for HCL ME (Realtek rtl8191sevb)?

Worse the installer is all over the place with debian errors, inconsistencies and a couple of security issues. It worries me that users and being recommended to install this package at all.\nCheck what kernel driver is currently loaded by using lsmod, if you can find ath9k or ath9k_htc in the list, then that's what it's called. Use that exactly name. If that still doesn't work, then it's very likely that because the htc is a non-standard driver, the hostapd just don't know how to deal with it.\nBut I think it's probably more likely that the driver is really the ath9k driver with new firmware.\n\nA: If you read the sample hostapd.conf file, \"ath9k_htc\" is not a valid driver name for hostapd. You cannot just put anything after \"driver=\". Read the sample hostapd.conf, there you will find the valid driver names that you can use.\nAdditionally, AP functionality for the ath9k_htc is provided as a patch and is experimental (very fresh), besides you need new firmware, which means: downloading compat-wireless, applying the patch, compiling and installing. I don't think that .deb installer has AP functionality.\nI invite you to visit wireless.kernel.org for more information.\n\nA: Like user10699 said, \"ath9k_htc\" is not a valid driver option for hostapd.conf. You want to use \"nl80211\" instead. The driver option for hostapd is more about how to communicate with the kernel module, versus what the underlying driver actually is.\nA couple other things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're running kernel/compat wireless 3.0 or greater. AP mode for ath9k_htc was added then (and is still considered experimental).\n\n*Check what firmware you have. It should be htc_9271.fw (found here once kernel.org is brought back up).\n\n", "Q: Redmine install from repos is having macro problems I installed Redmine from the Ubuntu repos and have tried reinstalling it, but I am still having a problem where text is not being replaced thoughout the Redmine install.

I am relatively new at using Linux and have just installed a fresh(ish) copy of Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS Minimal install running on a HyperVM VPS.\nHow would I enable ACL? I have a question on Superuser which resolved the problem I was trying to solve on a virtual machine running Ubuntu Server 10.10.\ndf -T yields /dev/simfs of type reiserfs - What would I put in fstab to mount ACL for the file system? At the moment this file is blank.\nafter running sudo mount -o remount,acl / I get mount:permission denied. Any suggestions?\nEdit\nMarked as solved as from all the research that I have done it's been concluded that I am unable to use ACL's on a VPS due to permissions.\n\nA: Reiserfs simply doesn't have support for access control lists. At least not according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Metadata\nEDIT: As grawity points out in the comments, it appears to have support for so-called POSIX ACLs, despite what that wikipedia-page says.\nThe permission denied message is a bit odd, then. I suspect the VPS adds some restrictions regarding that. Have you tried adding the acl option in /etc/fstab, and then rebooted?\nEach line of the /etc/fstab file has six fields separated by whitespace (excluding lines that start with #, which are ignored). On the line where the second field is /, add ,acl to the end of field 4. E.g. if field 4 just says defaults, change it to defaults,acl.\nAfter you've rebooted, run mount, and check if it has been mounted with the acl option.\n", "Q: Trying to make file executable on USB, but the permission doesn't \"stick\" \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to 'chmod' on an NTFS ( or FAT32 ) partition? \n\nI'm using LastPass as my password manager, and I use Sesame for multifactor authentication. On Windows this was no problem, but I alternate between Windows and Linux computers, so I need to have Sesame available for both cases.\nOn my laptop I'm running Ubuntu 10.10, and I downloaded the 32bit LastPass Sesame (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS) and moved the files (an executable and a .bin) to my USB device. As instructed, I tried to run chmod +x sesame on the executable (whose name is sesame).\nI tried this from the terminal window, but when doing an ls -la afterwards I noticed that the permissions on the file hadn't changed a bit. I tried doing the same adding sudo at the start, but that didn't make any difference either (and I didn't get any kind of error message or anything). I also tried doing it the \"graphical\" way, by right-clicking on the executable in Nautilus > Properties > Permissions, and trying to check off the Allow executing file as program check box - the checked marked only disappeared again after a second.\nIf I moved the same executable to my hard drive, it worked very fine to make it executable (and execute it).\nI'm not really experienced with Linux, so I suspect I'm missing something obvious. Might it have something to do with the USB being fat32 (but I thought files on a fat32 partition should be executable by default?), and if so - what are my options?\nAnd just to have said it: it works very fine to run the Windows version of Sesame using Wine, but it's a bit of a hassle (at least if I need it somewhere Wine isn't already installed).\n\nA: You can't chmod fat32 files... . only linux filesystems \"accept\" linux permissions.\nEasiest way would be to execute it from your home folder, for instance.... Copy it there and chmod it, then execute it as you were trying before, but at the new location.\nAlso you can check this: How can I run an executable from a CD when it doesn't have the executable bit set?. Basically, it talks about knowing if the file is really a binary one or it's a text script with the .bin extension. If this is the case, you can execute it with bash, python, ruby or whatever.\n\nA: See this answer. You basically can define permissions when mounting the device. In your case, you would do something like:\nsudo mount -t vfat -o rw,user,umask=000 /path/to/device /path/to/mount/dir\n\nFor a permanent change, you can add this to your /etc/fstab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of your device using sudo blkid.\n\n*Add the mount line to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=your-uuid /path/to/mount/dir vfat rw,auto,user,umask=000 0 0\n\n", "Q: show underlined menu items by default in the previous releases of ubuntu menu items were underlined by default so i didnt have to press Alt to show them. however in maverick one has to press Alt to view them. how can i set ubuntu to show underlined menu items by default?\nis there a setting in gconf-editor?\n\nA: As per Ubuntu bug 403691, try editing your .gtkrc and adding:\ngtk-auto-mnemonics = 0\n\nThe .gtkrc file to edit will either be in ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkrc or your current theme's gtkrc, e.g. /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.\nI'm guessing you need to log out and back in for it to take effect.\n", "Q: Can't get bonding and bridging to work for KVM I can't for the life of me get bonding and bridging to work for the KVM setup I'm building. I'm using a fresh install (not an upgrade) of Ubuntu Server 10.10. I have 4 NICs on the same subnet (two intended for each of my two VMs). I'm trying to achieve the setup that Uthark describes here.\nBut following his guidelines didn't work for me. My eth0 and eth1 did not come up, and \"brctl show\" showed that br0 didn't have any interfaces (the bond). I assumed it didn't work because he's using 10.4, and this article says there's a recent change in bonding:\n[I can't post more than one hyperlink per post because I'm a newbie.]\nI had to use this article to get my interfaces to work at all on the same subnet, which is why I have the post-up lines on some of my interfaces:\n[I can't post more than one hyperlink per post because I'm a newbie.]\nI installed ifenslave and ethtool.

The bond0 would continuously cycle same as shown in your snippet. The version of IOS needed wasn't supported on that model Catalyst. Just something to check...\n", "Q: Upstart, one job definition to start and one to stop Hi i just discoverd ubuntu upstart (etc/init/* scripts).\nAnd i would like to use it to run a particular application.\nThis app is run via a command line, but there is an argument to start an instance of the app and another argument to stop it (let say 'start' and 'stop')\nIs there a way to use upstart for that ??\n\nA: It should be as simple as creating a file /etc/init/myjob.conf:\ndescription    \"My Job\"\n\n# start conditions for automatic start\n# stop conditions for automatic stop\n\npre-start exec /path/to/program start\npost-stop exec /path/to/program stop\n\nYou should then be able to do sudo start myjob to start and sudo stop myjob to stop.\nSee http://upstart.ubuntu.com for some more info.\n\nA: If all you want to do is start/stop the service at boot time.. then drop your script in /etc/init.d and run\nupdate-rc.d yourscript defaults\n\nOr if that complains\nupdate-rc.d yourscript start 20 2\nupdate-rc.d yourscript stop 20 0\nupdate-rc.d yourscript stop 20 1\nupdate-rc.d yourscript stop 20 6\n\nBoth of which will add it to the bootup/shutdown.\nNote that this means it will run as root.. so you may want to make sure the script switches users to your user or another one that you want this program running as.\nUpstart is meant to replace such scripts if at all possible. The motivations for this are faster boot and a more clear encoding of the information needed to know when to start/stop a service. It achieves the faster boot specifically by only having to read the contents of /etc/init to get started, which is especially beneficial when you add in ureadahead to the boot process, as the less random tiny script files ureadahead has to cache, the more it can spend time on important things like libraries and programs needed to start the system up.\nI'd bet that the script you're running does a few things to setup the environment, then runs the program in a daemonized mode. Your upstart job should seek to replace the script's logic, not just run the script.\n\nA: I guess you'll want it to start or stop on different events, so it'll be easier to set up two different jobs.\nIf the same events toggles your app, then you could set up a job with a script that checks wether it's running or not, and hence starts or stops your app.\n", "Q: Randomly displayed flashing lines, no response to all shortcuts, just power off.

For this, I use a script that, amongst other things, sets system-wide proxy settings:\necho \"export http_proxy=http://myproxy:3128/\" > /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh\necho \"export HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy:3128/\" >> /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh\nchmod a+x /etc/profile.d/proxy.sh\n\nI can confirm that the variables are set correctly when checking in a shell. Most programs respect this setting and use my proxy. Firefox, however, does not. When I open its network connection settings dialog, however, it is pre-set to \"use system settings\" for the proxy. \nWhat does Firefox expect here? A differently-named variable? Can I set something in FF's prefs.js?\n\nA: According to a listing of commandline options there is no explizit option for a proxy. As you found out also neither http_proxy nor something alike works. I would suggest to first create a profile:\nfirefox -CreateProfile foo\n\nNext you can use sed or whatever tool you like to write user_pref(\"network.proxy.http\", \"YOUR_PROXY\"); user_pref(\"network.proxy.http_port\", PORT); to prefs.js. Now Firefox should work fine with those proxies.\n\nA: Firefox just can't do the standard thing and use environment variables (though to be honest this is partly justified as the standard thing doesn't allow for proxy autoconfiguration files). The preferences for static proxies are\nuser_pref(\"network.proxy.http\", \"wwwproxy.example.com\");\nuser_pref(\"network.proxy.http_port\", 3128);\nuser_pref(\"network.proxy.type\", 1);\n\nThere's a Firefox extension to use $http_proxy and similar environment variables: Environment Proxy.\nRecent versions of Firefox supposedly use the usual environment variables by default, or if the proxy type preference is explicitly set to 5 (“Use system proxy settings”), but it doesn't work for me with the version in Ubuntu 10.04.\nuser_pref(\"network.proxy.type\", 5);\n\n\nA: You say 'proxy', but your examples indicate you probably mean 'HTTP proxy' specifically.  However, if you also have access to a SOCKS proxy, which does not forbid HTTP traffic, you could use the tsocks tool:\ntsocks firefox\n\nonce you have configured /etc/tsocks.conf suitably.\n", "Q: What would be most efficient PC configuration for professional non-linear video editing? I'm a broadcaster with editing experience in Final Cut Pro and some Avid work. Over the past few months, I have been eagerly awaiting the Linux FOSS release of Lightworks, an award-winning non-linear video editor. On their website Lightworks Beta release, it mentions that the program can make use of your GPU for faster and smoother computing. With that being said, what would be the best system components to purchase individually so that I may assemble my own custom professional desktop editor? \n\nA: First of all, I can see you are interested in hardware.\nFortunatelly for you, Ubuntu is ready to edit the majority of digital video files with several software and the required codecs, which can be easily installed.\nUnfortunatelly, when the thing is related to \"High Definition Video\" the task may be so difficult.\nHowever, I am also waiting for the first release of LightWorks, which has already been released for MS based systems. However, you will have a few choices in ubuntu, other than LightWorks which are working pretty fine, such as: kdenlive, openshot and a few more.\nBut we were talking about hardware configuration. And for that I may suggest you to reach the best of two items in your bundle:\n1.- The best MicroProcessor you can pay for (starting from core2duo), and...\n2.- The best Graphics card (VGA, HDMI, DVI) you can get with less money. (from 512 MB will be good, 1 GB great!)\nThere are people which says that File Transfer Bus will be the most important thing in the architecture of a good CPU but, what would a fast FTBus be good for?, if in the case of non linear editing systems, the most important is not how the system reads the files in the hard drive, but the way the things are drawn in the screen. And I am refering to those portions of video that should be pre-rendered in order to perform a preview of the final video.\nI think that the rest of the items in the bundle (motherboard and its architecture, hard disk drives and its size, and a few other accessories) can be added when needed.\nHowever, if you find interesting, I extend you an invitation to follow my search of a good architecture (hardware and software) for the \"Editing High Definition Video in Linux\" thread that I am documenting in the next link:\nhttp://ultimateeditionisrael.freeforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=89&t=618\n\nA: Not exacly an answer to you question, but even so worth taking note of. Kdenlive is able to use proxy editing and this way you can edit hd footage with no exeptional hardware. Only the final product is rendered at full hd and that takes some time, in my case 3 times realtime. Btw it has an amazing set of effects.\nRinus\n", "Q: How to make in CLI check for updates to be happening every 4 weeks and install them automatically without going to Software sources? I have a set of custom commands I run on my computers after I install them. How do I make Ubuntu check for updates every 4 weeks and install them automatically on check?\nI would need this done via command line so I can set it up for usual users when I set up their computers.\nThe first command will make the update manager check for updates every 2 weeks because they not always come so much and to save the bandwidth of the Ubuntu servers.\nI also need to set it so that users don't need to click to install updates since it's tiring every time I help a friend set up a computer.\n\nA: If you mean update everything \"updatable\", i.e., update ALL your packages, I guess you could cron (within the root cron) than every 28 days apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y is run.\nSome people have problems with crond jobs because of a restrictive PATH setting. Should you have any problem you can define your PATH at the very beginning of the crontab -e file (as suggested in CronHowto)\nAlso, to check that everything is going OK, I'd log the results, like this:\nroot@PORTATIL:/var/log$ crontab -l\n* * */2 * * /usr/share/myupdate.sh > /var/log/myupdate.log\n\nmyupdate.sh could be as simple as this:\n#!/bin/bash\n#Testing updates\necho \"$(date) Crond myupdate sarting.\"\napt-get update -y\napt-get upgrade -y\necho \"$(date)Crond myupdate finished.\"\n\n\nA: First, enable automatic updates like this:\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nYou then need to edit its configuration, type \nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\n(replace nano with your preferred text editor if you want)\nThe file looks like this:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n        \"Ubuntu maverick-security\";\n//      \"Ubuntu maverick-updates\";\n};\n\nThe // means this line is a comment and won't be considered by the program, remove the strokes to include stable release updates in addition to security fixes. Also, replace maverick with the version of Ubuntu you're running.\nTo set the interval at which the system checks for updates, edit the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic file with a text editor:\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"14\";\nAPT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"14\";\nAPT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"14\";\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"14\";\n\nIn this example, the system is updated every two weeks.\nFor a more detailed explanation, see Automatic Updates in the Ubuntu server guide. \n\nNote that papukaija's answer is talking about the interval at which the Update Manager dialogue pops up on your screen, I'm guessing that's not what you wan't, but I'm not sure. :)\n\nA: You can change the interval between the time when update-manager is run by opening gconf-editor (for example with Alt+F2 and typing gconf-editor). Then locate /apps/update-notifier. \nThe interval is defined in key regular_auto_launch_interval where the value is number of days. I think that this method doesn't affect the non-graphical automatic updater (unattended-upgrades).\nPlease note that Ubuntu may not automatically install security updates due to a bug.\n\nA: I put gconftool -s /apps/update-notifier/regular_auto_launch_interval --type int 1 and its opening every day showing i have not installed updates. Does it open if theres no new updates? So then making auto update every 4 weeks would not make this pop up? So then just how to make with CLI to auto install updates every checking every 4 weeks? THats what i want. By not going to Software sources and doing it with mouse. And doing so its possible couse it cant be put more then 2 weeks in there.\n", "Q: How do I execute a file from a FAT USB drive? I'm trying to install a portable app onto my USB drive such that it is compatible with both Ubuntu and Windows (specifically, a program called eToys). Support is already built into the app for both operating systems - there's etoys.sh for Ubuntu and etoys.exe for Windows. I decided to install onto a FAT drive since that can be read from both systems. This works fine for Windows, but for some reason I cannot execute etoys.sh on Ubuntu.\nThe problem is not with the file - when the whole folder is copied to the local hard drive, the app works great in Ubuntu. But when I try to execute it from the USB, it opens the file in a text editor.\nI then tried to run it from a terminal, but I got the message Permission denied.\nI've had the same problem with other executables as well.\nIs there an easy way to execute things from a USB stick?\n\nA: Mounting the device with -o mode=<value> should work\nmode=value\n\nSet the mode of all files to value & 0777 disregarding the original permissions.  Add search  permission  to  directories  that have read permission.  The value is given in octal.\n\nA: I actually found a great solution at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1665289 that fixed the problem.\nBasically, it says to run the command \nsudo sed -i -e 's|showexec|\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00|g' /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon\n\nand that will prevent disks from auto-mounting with the showexec option.\nI don't like to answer my own question, but this worked for me and I hope it helps other people too.\nfor ubuntu 18.04:\nsudo sed -i -e 's|showexec|\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00|g' /usr/lib/udisks2/udisksd\n\n\nA: Ultimately, the issue seems to be that udisks mounts the filesystem with the showexec option, preventing any file that don't end in .exe, .bat, or .com to be run.\nA related question (how to give custom mount options to udisks) can be found here: How to configure to record data to pendrive instantly? Turns out that you can use udev configuration to do that.\nIs setting default mount options for udisks really not possible? proposes another solution based on udisks-glue, but it seems less convincing, as it ultimately rely on udisks, so that it seems that you can add options, but not remove them, and in particular showexec is still there). \nIn any case, I tend to prefer that to patching a binary file.\n\nA: None of the solutions shown worked as far as I could tell to get a program I wrote as a Linux terminal program to run in my FAT32 partition, but changing the filename of the program to include .exe extension did work (thanks for the tip), all I did was rename filename to filename.exe for the terminal program I was trying to execute on a FAT32 partition, and then un-mount it, re-mount it and set the disk permissions to allow execution, then go to filename.exe and set its permissions and then the check mark would stick rather than turn back to a minus, and when I set the path and entered ./filename.exe at the terminal prompt the program ran as it should and shows the command line including filename.exe as entered, although the Ubuntu file directory shows the file as MSDOS/Windows it does run as a Linux program.\n\nA: Because of limitations of the FA32 file system, you can't.\nNow, you can cheat:\n\n\n*\n\n*either call sh etoys.sh instead of ./etoys.sh\n\n*if you want, you can even create another script (that would lie on your hard drive, for example) that simply calls your script on the USB drive:\n#!/bin/bash\nsh /media/USB/etoys.sh\n\n\nA: You can use umask=000 mode:\numount /dev/sdb1\nmount -o umask=000 -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1\n\nSource: wiki.linuxquestions.org, section \"Mount options for fat\" in mount(8).\n\nA: So I found a much simpler (and safer solution).\nUse gparted to format the USB FAT32 and then us Partition=>Manage Flags to set the following flags: boot, lba\n\nA: On Windows volumes, it is most often possible to simply rename shell scripts, 'shell.sh', as 'shell.sh.bat' so that the executable nature from one environment's volume file system (Windows) is in inferred in the other (Linux).\nOnce renamed, nothing special needs to be done on reboots.\nOnly if live system immediate use is needed, is it usually required to re-register the file and its volume, with a simple remounting, when this rename or an edit to the file content itself is made.\nThis remount can be done two ways, either:\n\n*\n\n*For a removable/USB volume simply eject it and reinsert it, otherwise turn the system off and then back on (ie. a reboot, which \"kills\" the \"live\" system).\n\nor\n\n\n*Use commands to umount and mount (naively, i.e. as \"usual\") the volume.\n\n\nA: Try this, but I'm not sure it will work:\n\n*\n\n*Open the USB stick in the file manager\n\n*Right click inside the window and select 'open in terminal'\n\n*Type in the terminal window the following: sudo chmod +x etoys.sh\n\n*Try to execute the file or by double clicking it or by typing the following in the same terminal window: ./etoys.sh\n\nA: If the syntax is bash...\nbash yourscript\n\n", "Q: How to run TurboTax online?

We can't make any guarantees that you won't run into problems though.\nhttps://turbotax.intuit.com/login/start.jsp\n\n\nA: Why would a Web-Application not support an Operating System? AFAIK, if something is not supported, then it is the browser (and generally, only one Browser is mentioned in that context). What I could think of is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Those people are simply biased towards Linux and block any access from it.\n\n*They are using a plugin or special software that is only supported by Windows or Mac and therefor block access from Linux (I doubt it)\n\n\nIn any case, you should get a User-Agent-Switcher. With that little plugin, you can fake your Browser and/or Operating System so that the website does not know that you are running Linux. It is kind of sad that people have to resort to those methods.\nA firefox agent switcher can be obtained here:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/developers\n\nA: I installed Wine in Ubuntu:\nsudo aptitude install wine\n\nThen download firefox for windows and install under wine.\nNext download and install flash 9 or 10 for windows under wine.\nNow open the wine version of firefox and turbo tax online will think you are using windows - works every time.\n\nA: If it really isn't platform specific (doesn't use IE specific Javascript or Active X), you can install the User Agent Switcher addon in Firefox and fool the website into thinking you are on another platform.\n\nA: *\n\n*Get Chrome (I'm running Chromium\n9.0.597.107 (75357) Ubuntu 10.10).\n\n*Download the User Agent Switcher\nExtension and install it.\n\n*A new button appears on the top right.  Click it and select Internet Explorer 8.\n\n*Go to TurboTax and sign in.

Can it be a delay after startup somehow? \n\nA: I think the reason is that gvim has to load more libraries than vim. If you're using a gnome environment, some of them - but maybe not all of them - are already loaded. gvim needs to load a vim session and then wrap it too.\nThen again, it could depend on your .vimrc (even though you say vim loads fast).\nOne workaround could be having one and only one instance of gvim running and doing something suggested here, namely \nalias gvim=\"gvim --remote-tab-silent\"\n\nwhich will open all new files in the same instance as a new buffer.\n", "Q: Connected wireless connection, but no wlan0.

So, to fix the problem, you'd:\nsudo conky -d\n\ninstead of\nconky -d\n\nAlso, the eth1 / wlan0 problem is specific to Broadcom drivers (and is supposed to happen with them)\n\nA: What you need to do is load up your conky script into a sext editor, and search and replace wlan0 for eth1. also look for other scripts that the main script calls and do the same as this is reasonable common with conky.\n", "Q: How do I disable Ubuntu One? I do not use Ubuntu One but that Ubuntu One ribbon keeps appearing when I open some folders. As I don't use Ubuntu One and don't intend to use it in near future, is there a way that Ubuntu One support completely goes away from my laptop? Something like apt-get remove u1-support so I no longer see that ribbon nor the preferences menu entry?\n\nA: You should go to Software center or Synaptic and uninstall the ubuntuone-client pakage if you want to remove all of ubuntu one(including gnome integration).\nif you want to remove just the ubuntuone gnome integration(right click menus,applets etc)  then just remove ubuntuone-client-gnome .\n\nA: You can uninstall the packages, yes. Ubuntu One involves two bits running on your computer: the Ubuntu One file sync client or syncdaemon, and desktopcouch backed by a CouchDB that replicates with the Ubuntu One CouchDB. If yo want to completely remove both, a quick way of doing that would be\nsudo apt-get --purge remove .*ubuntuone.* .*couch.*\n\nIf all you want to do is disable the file synchronization daemon, however, you can simply disable the service in ubuntuone-preferences, from the Services tab:\n\n\nA: You should try : \nrm –rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\nrm –rf ~/.cache/ubuntuone\nrm –rf ~/.config/ubuntuone\nrm –rf ~/Ubuntu\\ One\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntuone-client* python-ubuntuone-storage*\n\nIt should remove dependencies and the ribbon (hopefully) with the config files been removed.\n\nA: the ubuntu one help site has this helpful page if you want to get rid of it ...\nHow do I completely remove and reinstall Ubuntu One?\nJust don't reinstall I guess\n", "Q: DynDNS updater?

I've renamed this to reflect what I've learned. The details below track the issue.\nORIGINAL POST:\nI'm trying to install a set of OpenType Helvetica fonts. The font installation is failing because the \"Thin\" fonts are described in the font properties as \"Light\", triggering a \"this font is already installed on your system\" error.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I open either font in KFontView, the font name is \"Helvetica, Light\".\n\n*When I click on File Properties and go to the \"Information\" tag, the \"Font.Weight\" is \"Light\" for both fonts.\n\n*When I open up the fonts in FontForge, the Thin font says \"Thin\" and the Light font says \"Light\".\n\n*When I save the thin font as an sfd file from FontForge and open it in Kate, the string \"Light\" can't be found.\n\n*When I open up the thin font binary (oft) in Kate the string \"Light\" can't be found.\n\n\nI'm pretty sure I want to change the font.weight property of the Thin files to be \"Thin\" so that a) I can install them and b) their metadata will be correct. But for the life of me I can't figure out where the font properties on the properties dialog are even stored; much less how to change them.\nThe only potential solution I've come up with so far (and I haven't tried it) is to install the Thin fonts, go into the font-config database to correct the names, and then install the Light fonts. Aside from being a PITA and presumably losing my changes if I have to reinstall the fonts, this just seems like a Bad Idea.\nI'm happy to provide more information as requested.\nREVISION (27 JAN 2010)\nAdditional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is strictly a Qt or KDE issue. Moving the fonts into /usr/local/share/fonts and then calling \"fc-cache\" installs the fonts just fine. These fonts still don't appear in the KDE Font Installer, however.\n\n*Looking (lightly) at the source code, the font metadata that is messing up KDE is possibly stored in the UDS. There are too many generic terms for Google to be much help; so I'm not sure if the UDS is owned by the filesystem (ext3), the Qt toolkit, or (not likely) by KDE.\n\n*KMail treats fonts like MS Office on Windows. It hides all but the font family from the user and expects to find just bold, italic, and bold italic styles. It's not much use for testing this issue.\n\n*OpenOffice is better in that it shows the font families in the toolbar but shows all the styles in the text properties dialog. Unfortunately this code appears to be buggy; changing the style to anything other than the basic bold and italic didn't work.\n\n*Scribus treats fonts properly. After running fc-cache Scribus worked perfectly.\n\nA: It sounds very much like an error in Qt/KDE and should certainly report it:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\nhttps://bugs.kde.org/\nOtherwise, nothing you try is going to help if the Qt font indexer has a problem with this font. Make sure to include details and steps to reproduce.\n\nA: For anyone having a similar issue—I had it with Candara Light, which KDE kept insisting was Candara Regular—open the font in FontForge and make sure that the font's OS/2 Weight Class has the correct setting. (Detailed instructions are below.)\nNote that internally, i.e. in the font file, this setting is a pure number. This would explain why the OP couldn't find the string 'Light' anywhere in the file itself: what appears in the actual file is the number '300', not the string 'Light'.\nMore on Weight Class\nThat Weight Class is a number is documented e.g. here (look for usWeightClass). In principle it can be any integer between 1 and 999, but FontForge restricts it to be a multiple of 100. According to both FontForge and the linked document, the correspondences between these numbers and verbal descriptors ('Light', 'Regular', and so on) are as follows:\n100 Thin\n200 Extra-Light\n300 Light\n400 Regular\n500 Medium\n600 Semi-Bold\n700 Bold\n800 Extra-Bold\n900 Black\n\n(The linked document also includes 950 Extra Black.)\nIt seems that the verbal descriptor is added by FontForge for user convenience.\nThe following fact is an additional confirmation that this setting is internally a pure number: if the same font is opened in a different font manager, what is shown is just the number, without the verbal descriptor. For example, open the same font in the Typograph font manager. (I'm running this under wine; Typograph is a commercial product, but you can download it and use certain features—like the ones I'm about to describe—even without buying it.) Right-click on the font, select Properties, select the tab called Metric, and look under 'Windows metric data'. There will be an entry called 'WeightClass'. This will be a pure number, the same number as the number that appears in FontForge under OS/2 Weight Class.\nHow to change theOS/2 Weight Class in FontForge\nOpen the font in FontForge. In FontForge's menu bar, select Element, then Font Info… In the window that opens, on the left, select OS/2. In the main area, make sure the Misc. tab is selected, and look at the Weight Class field. Change it as necessary, press OK at the bottom of the window, and then generate (not save, generate) the font anew. (In other words, in FontForge's menu bar, select File, and then Generate Fonts…)\nIn my case, Weight Class was originally set to 400 Regular. But then I changed it to 300 Light, and this fixed the problem for me.\n", "Q: Priority for HTTP over SSH on server My file server on the internet runs OpenSSH, where users upload and download files using scp or WinSCP. At the same time, the server runs some web applications (http), which need higher priority.\nIs there a way to give HTTP priority over SSH file transfer? If not, can I limit SSH bandwidth for incomming connections?\n\nA: What you're looking for is called traffic shaping, which can be done (for instance) with wondershaper or trickle. Here is a nice article from linux.com summing up how to use trickle to achieve throttling on a single process or on services via trickled.\n\nA: SCP/SSH packets normally have a bulk TOS. So i think you should raise the TOS of TCP packets from port 80 using iptables TOS target. Then the standard tc-pfifo-fast priomap will do the right thing.\nPlay around the following:\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --sport 80 -j TOS --set-tos Maximize-Throughput\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j TOS --set-tos Maximize-Throughput\n\nOr actually, may be you should try to tune the QOS on your router and not on your server: change the QOS where the bottleneck is.\n", "Q: How do I add a repository from behind a proxy?

The launchpad's beta feature allows to create ubuntu packages using recipes. I got them to work, and I am now able to use them for packaging my project.\nHowever, I have little trouble with the ./debian/changelog file. I need to fill it in with a distribution name ([package name] ([version]) [distribution]; [urgency]). Let's say I put \"maverick\" there. Then I request a build using the recipe. I choose to build it both for maverick and natty. As the result, the natty package in tha PPA will have it's \"distribution\" field set to \"maverick\", which looks invalid (actually, it seems only the changelog will have this incorrect information, but I got aware of that fact, when the notification e-mail I got stated my package was released for natty, but it also said: \"Distribution: maverick\").\nIt this OK? I am not even sure whether it is incorrect, but if it is, then how do I use the recipe, to build a package for many ubuntu series, using one changelog file?\n\nA: In this context, the distribution field is irrelevant. Look in the official Ubuntu archives. Of course, you'll see that the top changelog entry will have \"unstable\" as the distribution for many packages. Likewise, all uploads that make it into the updates repository are actually copied over from the proposed repository. So a package in maverick-updates will actually say maverick-proposed in the changelog.\nThe importance of the distribution field depends on the tools that make use of it. For instance, if you use dput to upload to your PPA with: ~<your_launchpad_id>/<ppa_name>/ubuntu/\nthe distribution field in the changelog determines for which release the package will be built. But even this can be over-ridden by uploading directly to release you want  with:\n~<lp_name>/ppa/ubuntu/<ubuntu_release>\nLaunchpad's build from branch service uses the ability to copy a package from one PPA series to another. It doesn't actually care what is in the changelog for this. So the way you are currently doing things is correct.\n", "Q: How do I mount a Windows Live SkyDrive account as a partition?

First installation failed at the partitioning stage, next I tried manual partition that also failed. I finally went to Gparted LiveCD to see what I could do.    \nIt allows me to shrink the NTFS, create a swap partition, create a partition in the remaining space. If however I try to format the empty partition as ext3 or ext4 it fails, the drive disappears from Gparted and I have to reboot. When I come back in, the blank space is there with no file system.    \nIf I try to format the new partition in NTFS or Fat32 (as a test) it works fine and Windows can see it.    \nI even tried creating a FAT32 partition, doing and Ubuntu install to that disk, allocating almost all of it to Ubuntu (thinking I could use the small remainder as a shared disk), it started the install but failed after several minutes of copying with a warning about can not fsync (something) and something about RW problems.    \n(clarification because based on comments I thoroughly confused the issue, I didn't actually try to install to the FAT32, I just thought that it was odd that Gparted was successful in creating it, so kept the FAT32 which I thought was ok then let the installer shrink it and do whatever it wanted which was of course creating a ext4 beside the shrunken partition. This was an academic exercise since nothing was working anyway and thank all for pointing out my mistaken wording)\nAt this point I can't install Ubuntu because there seems to be now way to create a suitable partition.\n\nA: This sounds like you have a physically defective drive, or a defective live cd. The installer uses libparted to do it's formatting/partitioning work, so if that has a corruption then it could cause the disk to fail to partition in both gparted and the installer.\nWe will need more logs to see more of what's going on. Please report gparted errors and if possible, run from the command line.\nOn installing on FAT32, the problem is that Linux requires a modern file system with linking, per file permissions, etc. Windows file systems like FAT and NTFS never had these features and so it's not possible to install Ubuntu on them.

I don't think that it's good for the Linux desktop to be too fragmented, forks should rejoin the main projects and thus make Linux a better experience. \nSo if at some point in the future the community / Canonical has to decide between Unity and Gnome-Shell how hard would it be to merge the two projects?\n\nA: They certainly have plenty of differences both on a technical and functional level. They're also focussed on separate (though similar) creative directions and they're both very much in development and not final. It could easily be years before either settles with something that proves itself to work well.\nAt any point, ideas might traverse the void. This has clearly happened several times over already, nothing wrong with it and while it helps an on the interface-ideological-level, it does nothing to help developers unite behind a common programming language or compositor.\nI think it'll probably end with one solution \"winning\" (through progress on helpful features) and being adopted by the other camp but then again, there are few types of developers more stoic than FOSS developers. This might even take something like Wayland (essentially a replacement for X with its own compositing layer) coming along to mix things up.\nI wouldn't put a bet on either breaking far away from the other. At least, not until the underlying tech changes.\n\nA: Consider that Unity and Gnome Shell (aka Gnome3) share almost the entire operating system stack. The part that is vastly different is the shell part, the visual elements. I'm afraid when it comes to the shells, they are impossible to consolidate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome Shell is based on JavaScript and the developers are strictly rejecting any code that isn't javascript.\n\n*Unity is based in Python, C and Vala, it used to use the same compositor as Gnome Shell, but moved to Compiz because it was too slow.\n\n\nMore likely there will be a feeding of ideas between projects. Each project will get some things right and some things wrong. The project with the better sense of design, humility to accept what users want and ultimately the team with better economics (more developers) will develop faster and better over time.\n\nA: Seems unlikely.\nMost of unity is based upon compiz, while GS has built itself a new toolkit (based upon Mx) and stack, along with a new WM.\nGS could more easily emulate Unity than the reverse, and I wouldn't  be surprised to see skins that did this, but they probably aren't going to integrate.\nFundamentally this is an issue of Window Managers. Gnome built its own WM (really a port of Metacity to Clutter with many improvements improvements) and GS is a plugin to Mutter. JS is used for pretty much all of the interface elements while C is used in the libraries (Mutter is in C). JS is integral to the experience (not a bad idea considering how much effort is being put into JS research so things should rapidly improve, not that they NEED to).\nUnity took an existing WM and extended it and built an interface around it (very similar to GS) but used existing toolkits hence it is more difficult to create gl contexts in Unity unless you use Qt (I assume they will eventually move to it completely). Unity is a good choice for Canonical since they want to create a unique environment since it reuses so much but by not following upstream closely they risk always being behind the tech curve in gnome (again, another reason they will probably move to Qt).\nSo, if you could convince Gnome or Canonical to give up one of their WMs you might be able to get a merge, but what's the point? Let them create 2 different desktops and lets see which is better.\n", "Q: Can 'avahi' handle IP address lookups as well as host name lookups? Ubuntu uses 'avahi' to perform host name lookups on the local network, which allows me to find other computers just by adding '.local' to the name, e.g. laptop.local or desktop.local.\nHowever, avahi does not seem to perform reverse lookups for the IP addresses of computers on the local network. So when applications look up IP addresses for local computers, a request goes out to an Internet DNS server on the Internet which returns NXDOMAIN (name does not exist).\nIs it possible for avahi to perform reverse lookups for IP addresses? If it is, how do I do it?\n\nA: Yes, avahi supports reverse IP address lookups for the .local names that are registered on the local network. However, most of the commands for performing test queries contact DNS servers directly without using avahi. In order to confirm that this is working at the command line, you have to use the getent hosts command instead of nslookup, dig, or host.\nFor example, you can look up an IP address using the following commands:\n$ nslookup 192.168.0.1\n$ dig -x 192.168.0.1\n$ host 192.168.0.1\n$ getent hosts 192.168.0.1\n\nOnly the getent hosts command will return the corresponding name because it is the only command that uses avahi to perform the reverse lookup.\n(Actually, this also applies to looking up names, but it is usually simpler to just type ping hostname.local which performs a name lookup using DNS or avahi and checks connectivity at the same time.)\n\nA: dig also could perform reverse DNS lookup using avahi:\ndig -x 192.168.0.1 @224.0.0.251 -p 5353\n\nA: There is an avahi command for it: avahi-resolve-address. E.g.:\navahi-resolve-address 192.168.0.1\n\nOr, an equivalent variant:\navahi-resolve --address 192.168.0.1\n\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu OneConf be avaible in 11.04? Will OneConf be in the next release?

Prefer to delay one cycle to let ubuntuone guys working on that and having a sweet OneConf into Natty!\n\n\nA: Sadly, probably not. Right now even desktopcouch (which OneConf uses) isn't on the CD, and as far as I'm aware no further work has been done on OneConf in quite a while: the last commit to the project was in October 2010, so it's not looking good.\nNevertheless, there is still hope; you can keep track of the state of things better if you subscribe to the natty blueprint that revisits the issue.\n", "Q: Recover Ubuntu grub without LiveCD - Can't boot with Ubuntu LiveCD after install Windows I installed Windows after installing Ubuntu. But Ubuntu is still intact in its partition.\nI'm trying to run the Ubuntu LiveCD to recover grub, but the LiveCD no longer works. It stops the boot process and does not load completely.\nI can not run Ubuntu in live mode to recover grub.\nIs there any way to recover the grub/grub2 without the LiveCD?\nEdit:\n[Important] I've downloaded a new Ubuntu 10.10 ISO. I also did the MD5 check. It's all right. Then, I recorded this .iso and still can not load the LiveCD to the end.\n\nA: The easiest way would be to indeed create a new LiveCD or even a LiveUSB.\nFailing that, you can configure the Windows bootloader to boot Linux. Then, you can use your installed Linux to re-install grub to the MBR.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows (section 2) for information on how to perform this task.\n\nA: I could not recover the grub, but I found the problem.\nIn some machines, the Ubuntu 10.10 LiveCD has a bug. The problem is that the regular ISO still has the error, though a bug fix is available. But the MinimalCD is clean and works fine.\nI did this process and managed to install Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 32bit smoothly. It is also valid for other versions.\nThe bug:\nIf you're using a regular ISO, and you can not continue the boot process, you can see the bug as follows:\nWhen the boot process stops or freezes, you need to press \"F6\" and \"Esc\".

You can find if there's an existing LoCo team in the directory. I recommend you contact them and let them know that you're ready to start planning events at your school.\n\n*Throw a release party!!\n\n*You can run an Ubuntu Jam\n\n*You can run an Ubuntu Hour\n\n*And of course, you can all particiapte on Ask Ubuntu by asking more questions and answering them - the site is still relatively new and we could always use questions that new users are running into so we can help build a good list of answers.\n\n", "Q: Temperature indicator for gnome panel Is there an indicator (a.k.a applet, launcher) that I can embed to my gnome panel which shows my cpu, gpu, hdd etc. temperatures?\n\nA: sudo apt-get install sensors-applet\n\nThen when you right click the panel, and go to \"Add to panel...\" and add a \"Hardware Sensors Monitor\", you'll see something like this:\n\nAnd yes, as luri points out, you'll also need to set up lm-sensors for this:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nGo through that and find out what modules need adding (you can have it write to modprobe directly in the last step) and then you should be good to go.\n\nA: sensors-applet will do the trick for you. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors sensors-applet \n\nYou should then do sudo sensors-detect so that lm-sensors is configured (it will scan sensors in your hardware).\nThen simply add \"Hardware Sensors Monitor\" to the panel. Then, within the context menu, you will be able to configure which sensors will be shown, units, update interval....\n\nA: You can also check the latest indicator-sysmonitor build (.deb), 0.3.

I would like to be able to launch it/ kill it from command line.\n\nA: Even when some applications uses the terminal to monitor the process of a software, there are some other programs that simply run and returns the control to the terminal. So you can close the terminal keeping the application running.\nThat way, pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal, won't stop the application.\nYou can use the \"killall\" command to stop the program when you face that condition in a program.\nIn example: if you are running kdenlive and it stops responding or you wish (as you say) to close the application using a command in the terminal, just drop a line like:\nkillall kdenlive\n\nYou can do this with any other application, but if you are running more than one instance of the program which is going to be killed, all the instances of the program are going to be closed.\nIf you -in example- drop the: killall nautilus in order to close the file browser, you are also closing the main browser that is used for the Desktop management.\n\nA: Short Version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the Exec command for your app by grepping the applications directory\ngrep 'Calculator' /usr/share/applications/*\n\n\n*Start the app\ngcalctool\n\n\n*Kill it by hitting Ctrl+C\n\nFirst, find out where your application is. A few directories are in an environment variable $PATH, so that you don't have to type the whole directory.\nOne way to find your app is to open the Menu Editor (right click on the Applications Menu and select Edit Menus) and find the app's command.\nThe calculator, for example is gcalctool at /usr/bin/gcalctool (use the whereis command to find the exact path of an app). Since /usr/bin is in the PATH variable (type echo $PATH), you can run it in your terminal by typing gcalctool. \nIt's now running in the foreground. You can pause it by pressing Ctrl+Z, resume it in the background by typing bg,or resume it in the foreground by typing fg. You can also use fg to raise an app to the foreground.\nIf you do this with multiple apps, you can use jobs to get a numbered list of all of them, and then use, for example, fg 3 to raise one of them. \nAn App that is in the foreground can be killed with Ctrl+C or Ctrl+\\ (if it doesn't react to the former).\nA universal way to find your app is to open the File Browser, go to Filesystem → usr → share → applications and to find your app there.\nYou'll see a bunch of .desktop files, which you can drag into a Text Editor (or use cat) to read. This is a piece of the Calculators .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Calculator\nComment=Perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations\nExec=gcalctool\nThe Exec entry is what you're interested in here. It's the same you would see if you went to the Menu Editor, just quicker. You can grep the files to search them for your app, if you can't find it.\nIf the app doesn't have a .desktop file in the applications directory, you have to know it's command of course.

I'd rather not do that.\nIs there a workaround for this so that I can get roughly the same functionality I'd get using Outlook for Windows?\n\nA: You'll need to use the MAPI plugin for Evolution. \nsudo apt-get install evolution-mapi\n\nI've been able to use this successfully at a previous place of employment where the only source of mail was an Exchange Server. To my knowledge contact syncing did not work - but calendar and mail services worked properly.\nDuring the setup I needed to use the IP address of the exchange server (you can find this out by contacting your local IT or running a dig against the mail server's domain) as well as including my domain for the user login ( eg: DOMAIN\\user). After setup of the account I needed to restart evolution for the sync to take place.\n\nA: Evolution is supposedly capable of connecting to Exchange servers, but I have tried with OWA and MAPI both with older and new Exchange servers to no avail -- if Evolution by some odd chance is able to connect, it crashes... Thunderbird is now my default mail client. \nBut that doesn't fix connecting to Exchange, for that you could use Davmail (http://davmail.sourceforge.net/). Davmail works as a gateway between the Exchange server and your local mail/calendar/contacts client. Davmail connect to exchange and provides local interfaces that Thunderbird and Evolution  can understand; for mail, contacts, calendar etc. And it does so really well, although a little slow at time!\nGood luck!\n/N\n\nA: It's pretty simple -- you can't.\nI'm in a similar situation at my job.  DAVMail is pretty wonky -- sometimes it makes so many requests the system locks my account and I have to call tech and have them unlock it.\nSometimes it just doesn't sync.\nThe MAPI plug-in is even worse -- it just randomly plain doesn't work.\nRunning IE in Wine is a not-so-decent-but workable solution, but honestly, Outlook on Windows is the only piece of software that works correctly with Exchange.  Even Entourage (the old Mac client) uses the DAV interface (just like DAVmail) and the new Outlook for the Mac requires the latest versions of Exchange as well.\nBalls vendor lock-in\n", "Q: If I downgrade gwibber, will it still work with twitter?

However, I use twitter quite a bit, and I'd hate to be hit with OAuth problems. Will this be safe?\n\nA: What version are you downgrading to? \nI believe maverick-updates has a backported OAuth fix. Either way, it's had several version bumps since maverick-proper.\nIf it's before Maverick, again it may have been backported in the updates repo but I can't say for certain.\n", "Q: 2.6.37 (or 2.6.36) Ubuntu Kernel in Maverick. Is this possible and where can I get it? Is it possible to get a newer kernel with the ubuntu patches applied (as a deb + related packages - such as headers, since this machine would be best not compiling the kernel for time restraints)? I'd prefer a ppa, if one exists.\n\nA: I build my own kernels. Following the \"old fashioned way\" from the Ubuntu help page makes it a doddle. Most of the time is spent waiting for it to compile (it's big -- 6GB over 80,000 files once compiled). Don't be scared by that. It's a good learning experience.\nOther people may suggest \"mainline\" builds but these are only kept up to date for the latest version of Ubuntu. You can usually just pull these back but pair that with GCC version mismatches and other undesirable things, it's usually just easier to compile it yourself.\nI've gone over the steps at least five times on here already, so here's a link to my last effort.\n\nA: There's a PPA for mainline kernel builds.  You can read all about it on the wiki.\nThe easiest way to get a more recent kernel is to grab the appropriate deb for your hardware from launchpad and install it.\n", "Q: How can I connect to my Amazon EC2 server using a desktop client I've already setup an Amazon EC2 instance running 10.10 and am able to connect to it using the ssh command provided by Amazon. I noticed there is a 'Terminal Server Client' and a 'Remote Desktop Viewer' included with Ubuntu, and I was wondering if it's possible to use either of these to connect to my server. It would be a far more convenient than typing out the rather long ssh command (after first navigating to the directory in which my key is stored).\nI've had a few tries at connecting with both of them, but the problem is I don't know what I should be putting in the fields since all the documentation provided by both Amazon and Ubuntu assume I already know what I'm doing with servers.\nUpdate: From reading the answers it seems I've left out a crucial piece of information. I wish to administer my server using a terminal. My question is about making the connection process as simple as possible.\n\nA: I think you're asking how you can shorten the following command:\nssh -i ~/path/to/your/ssh_key.pem \\\n   ubuntu@ec2-79-125-64-190.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com\n\nThat can be accomplished with with edits to ~/.ssh/config.\nThe following example ssh config stanza might be helpful:\nHost myec2server\n  IdentityFile /home/USERNAME/ec2/ec2-keypair.eu-west-1.pem\n  User ubuntu\n  HostName ec2-79-125-64-190.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com \n\nNow, you can just type ssh myec2server. see man ssh_config for more ssh_config tricks.  You can then combine that with another of the answers here and create a launcher with the command:\ngnome-terminal --execute ssh myec2server  \n\nAlso related, is a new-ish EC2 feature import-keypair that allows you to upload your own public keys.  Then, you can launch new servers with keypairs that you use elsewhere.\n\nA: You tend not to run desktop instances (that is the full X/GDM/Gnome stack) on server. That graphics stack eats tons of RAM and that very much equates to money when you're talking about EC2.\nIn short, I think if you're trying to VNC in, you've probably the wrong end of the stick. You certainly can install X et al on a server and then you can install TightVNC (or other) to provide graphical access over network... But if you're just trying to administer a system, learn to use the console and live without it, or use a webmin solution.\n\nA: Can you not just make a launcher?

I removed the software I wasn't using like Evolution and Gwibber.\nNothing happened. The updater will simply not update this software since you don't have it. It's ok then.\nAfter, for a major upgrade to 11.04 for example, I don't know if everything will come back.

I was wondering if there are any GUI alternatives to the Network Manager. It seems, I always run into problems with it (unstable connections, wrong icon shown, wrong notifications, etc.).\n\nA: I know of wicd, but it feels ugly.\nLatest version is 1.7.4, released on 2016-01-25.\n\nA: The alternative being investigated by Canonical is called ConMan, or the Intel/Moblin Connection Manager:\nhttp://moblin.org/projects/connection-manager\nIt's got a couple of great features that can recommend it above network manager, but it's also got some integration issues with the normal FreeDesktop setup. I believe people are working on the ubuntu packages and integration:\nhttps://launchpad.net/connman\nYou can see why the two are still being worked on here:\nWhy are two indicator-network versions being worked on?\n\nA: I wrote a very simple python script to manage network, vsnm -- Very Simple Network Manager. I have described how it works here and source code is here.\n\nA: Wicd works but as other mentioned is ugly and clunky. If you need VPN support, you will also need to setup KVpnc which is just as ugly.\nhttp://home.gna.org/kvpnc/en/index.html\n\nA: I had to switch to WICD a year ago because of a specific issue on my network card. Its a little clunky, but not that bad. You can switch to WICD in 2 minutes, try it, and then make a decision. Also, for VPN you can also use vpnc, which is what I used.\nDetails are here:\nSwitching to WICD\n\nA: I am using nmcli from time to time, which is (I guess) a Fedora/Redhat CLI interface to NM. It allows listing wireless networks and existing connection and connecting to them, if the connection was already created (and, in my case, is available to all users - for some reason it didn't shows non-system connections in list).\nIt worked when I bricked the configs so nm-applet was unable to connect to NM via dbus.. however lack of ability of adding new connections is a problem, maybe will write a hack for this and finally rule the GUIsh part of NM out for good.\n\nA: Try Wifi-Connect for wpa/psk AP, open, and two phase authentication networks like eduroam. Plus wired eth0 eth1/2/3/4/5/6/7 and usb from mobile phone etc.\nThe scripts (no binaries) use busybox udhcpc, and dhcpcd as fallback if available.\nWifi-Scanner-2 supports 8 wireless interfaces for simultaneous scanning with results shown in tabbed yad gui. Provides mode and driver options.  random mac generator for scanning and again for connecting.\nWifi-Scanner-2 menu options include wpa_cli, auto-connect, saved-profiles with ssid+mac, eth1 eth2 usb0 wired connections.\nhttp://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?mode=attach&id=112794\n\nA: For people looking for NM alternatives in 2021, wicd is no longer maintained and getting dropped from several Distros.\nOne working alternative is ConnMan as given by this answer.\nI want to add to that answer that if you want a GUI systray interface to ConnMan, use cmst.

I did try manually but had problems. It is not a deal for experienced users like many of you here, but a big issue to a new one like me.\nI hope those clever programmers of Unity not force me to use their UI.\n\nA: Well, first of all, if you'd like Gnome on your netbook, you could technically install Ubuntu on it (no Netbook Edition).\nIf it's already there, you can just log out and choose the 'Gnome' session at the login screen. And maybe follow this guide to make it fully customizable.\n", "Q: Is there any way of adding Chinese characters to AutoKey? Each time I add Chinese characters to AutoKey and set an autokey.

It should be possible to make it support Unicode, however this would require changes to the source code.\nSince Autokey does not support Unicode, it does not support Chinese either.\n", "Q: How can I hard reset a USB device? I have a USB device (a modem) that is really finicky.  Sometimes it works fine, but other times it refuses to connect.  The only solution I have found to fix it once it gets into a bad state is to physically unplug the device and plug it back in.  However, I don't always have physical access to the machine it is plugged in on, so I'm looking for a way to do this through the command line.\nThis post suggests running:\nsudo modprobe -w -r usb_storage; sudo modprobe usb_storage\n\nHowever I get an \"unknown option -w\" output.  This slightly modified command:\nsudo modprobe -r usb_storage\n\nFails with the message FATAL: Module usb_storage is in use.  If I try to kill -9 the processes marked [usb-storage] before running they refuse to die (I think because they are deeply tied to the kernel).\nAnyone know of a way to do this?\nNOTE: I cross-posted this on superuser.com as I didn't know which was more appropriate.  I will delete and/or link whichever one is answered first.  \n\nA: Your modem driver might still be loaded.\ncheck with \"sudo lsmod\" which modules are using  usb_storage or any other usb modules.\nYou have to \"sudo modprobe -r the other modules\" first.\n\nA: Try to close any relevant service and afterwards try to remove  the dependencies first.\nThere is always the cruel way of rmmod but i don't suggest because it could crash your system\nYou could also make a script that disable usb power on such cases\n", "Q: Why do the interfaces show ipv6 address along with ipv4 I have manually specified only ipv4 address for my interfaces. But all the interfaces automatically show inet6 address as well. Does it mean that ubuntu starts an ipv6 tunnel by default. If it does, isn't it dangerous, as ipv6 assigns public ips for all LAN clients. I only have a firewall on my NAT router, and my clients, who's interfaces show ipv6 address, do not have firewalls. Here is a screenshot:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 34:dc:47:2e:ad:13\n          inet6 addr: fe80::28cf:38ff:fb7b:da19/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:5783 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:6098 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:1\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\n          RX bytes:2961324 (2.9 MB)  TX bytes:1573757 (1.5 MB)\n          Interrupt:46\n\nNote: For privacy reasons I have modified the HWaddr and inet6 addr values.\n\nA: The IPv6 address shown is link-local - this means that it is not publically accessible outside of your LAN, but is an automatic address assigned for communicating within your local network. For people to be able to access your computer via IPv6, there would need to be a public address on the interface & for it to be routed.\n\nA: IPv6 addresses are shown because IPv6 is enabled on network interfaces by default. The only way this would matter (I believe) is if the network you were connected to supported IPv6.\nI don't believe that Ubuntu would create a IPv6 tunnel to anything, it just leaves the protocol active on that interface. If IPv6 is available on your network, and the IPv6 side does not employ NAT, than there is the possibility that it is directly connecting you to the Internet.\nIn that case, if you were worried about your security, you could disable IPv6 using CYREX's answer.\n\nA: Try:\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\nYou can also change the ALL part in the line to specify eth0, eth1... the one you actually want to change that.\nNOTE: You NEED to be root to do this.\n", "Q: Which daemons can be stopped from loading at boot time?

It completely depends on your system and what you want to do with it. I don't know that anyone can give you a perfect answer.\nThe best thing, if you really want to streamline your boot process, is to study each of those daemons. Google each one of them, find out what they do. Then disable it. Try to boot. Use your system, see what works, what doesn't. Can you live without that daemon? Did it break your boot process? Re-enable it if you need, move to the next one.\nWhat's great about this is you'll break your system several times. In turn, you'll have to figure out how to fix it, and you'll have an even better understanding of how Ubuntu and linux work. Then you can come back here and answer lots of questions ;p\nOh, and, backup. Always backup.

I know from previous questions in various forums that Okular has this feature, but I prefer not to drag KDE dependencies just for this.  \nIs there an alternative that would work nicely in Gnome, without too many dependencies?  I don't mind using PPAs, building from source, using old X-style tools or writing small scripts - But I need something that is known to work and won't clutter my setup too much.\n\nA: As I noted in a comment, it would help to know if you have a particular editor in mind you want to use along with it.\nThe gedit-latex-plugin adds a built in PDF preview to gEdit, and I gather it supports SyncTeX forward/reverse searches. Certainly that's what jumps to mind to me when I think of something for GNOME users.\nThere are other LaTeX editors with built-in previewers that support SyncTeX jumps such as: TeXworks, Texmaker, TeXmakerX. These are all Qt-based rather than GTK-based, but still, none of them require KDE or its libraries like Kile/Okular do. (gummi is GTK based and has a built in previewer -- a live updating one at that -- but I don't think it supports synctex...)\nAs the other answer notes, evince is supposedly getting this feature, and people are working on the necessary plugins for interaction on the editor side. I gather it uses DBus for interaction--a big mistake if you ask me--but like you can't figure how it works. However, there is an older version of evince in the Arch Linux User Repository which has patched to provide SyncTeX support more directly. I've never tried compiling it on Ubuntu, though theoretically it should be possible. I have used it on Arch though, and it works fine.\nI personally, however, use MuPDF as my viewer for LaTeX composition, which I choose because it's the fastest PDF viewer I know, and the only one fast enough for the live-updating-preview script I use with Vim as my editor.\nWhile MuPDF doesn't support SyncTeX directly, I hacked together some xdotool scripts that provide partial SyncTeX support. Basically, for forward search, the scripts call synctex from vim to figure out what page matches the spot in the source, and then sends the appropriate keystrokes to MuPDF to jump to that page. I do this with a vim script, but with bash, something like this might do the trick:\n#!/bin/bash\n# mupdf-forward.sh\n# usage mupdf-forward.sh <line number> <column number> <tex file> <pdf file>\nSEARCHLINE=\"$1\"\nSEARCHCOL=\"$2\"\nTEXFILE=\"$3\"\nPDFFILE=\"$4\"\nPAGEFORWARD=0\nPAGEFORWARD=\"$(synctex view -i $SEARCHLINE:$SEARCHCOL:\"'\"'\"$TEXFILE\"'\"'\" -o \"'\"'\"$PDFFILE\"'\"'\" | grep -m1 'Page:' | sed 's/Page://' | tr -d '\\n'\")\"\nif [ $PAGEFORWARD -gt 0 ] ; then\n   xdotool search --class MuPDF type --window %@ \"${PAGEFORWARD}g\"\nfi\n\nIf you have the newest version of xdotool (newer even than the one in the Maverick repos), you can kludge up a similar kind of reverse search by having xdotool read the page number that MuPDF is showing from its title bar, call synctex, and then send the appropriate command to the editor to jump to where the code for that page is (--not nearly as precise as you'd get with a real SyncTeX-compliant PDF viewer, but not too shabby for something as lightweight as MuPDF).\nAnyway, you can read about and download the scripts I actually use for vim in this blog post. But if you want to use a different editor, you'll have to adapt the idea as necessary.\nBut hopefully the situation with evince will straighten itself out sometime soon too.\n\nA: Simply use Evince, the default document viewer for GNOME and Ubuntu.\nSince GNOME 2.32 (found in Ubuntu 10.10 and the upcoming Ubuntu 11.04), Evince supports SyncTex.

In contrast to the compose-key method it allows the input of any UTF-8 character. E.g., Ctrl + Shift  + U 263a +Space yields ☺.\nOf course, I use the compose-key method whenever applicable.\n\nA: You can use compose sequences which are more usable than the Alt+num method in Windows.\nFor more see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GtkComposeTable\nFor example, Compose + t + m = ™\n", "Q: Unable to dual-boot Windows 7 and Kubuntu 10.10 I have installed Windows 7 and Kubuntu 10.10, but the boot menu isn't displayed, and the computer boots into Windows 7 directly. \nHow to fix this?\n\nA: You most probably installed Windows last.

Pinging stuff is totally dead.\nI have absolutely no idea on how to proceed from now. What should I do?\n\nA: It's perfectly normal, as by default, all connections are made through your VPN. You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can configure you VPN server to let connections to the outside go through the VPN\n\n*you can configure you client to only use your VPN for connections to other machines in the private network\n\n\nA: Eraser is correct with regards the 2 configuration setups. The control to change this is buried in the config panels of the Network Manager Open VPN setup (There is a checkbox with an option like \"Use this connection for all routing\" which, when unticked, will allow you to connect to the Internet through your normal connection and only use the VPN for IPs configured on the VPN network).\nAlternatively, depending on the interface (not sure which type you're using), there should be a \"Only use VPN for these addresses\" checkbox with a text input to specify an IP range.\n\nA: The network connection through the OpenVPN should work.

These have been detected during a scan and now your drive is read only. You need to run fsck against your main root partition while the partition isn't mounted or read only. It's read only so you should just have to run fsck.\nIf it's possible to run the LiveCD, you can use the gui tools to fix the issue, you can do all this using the System > Administration > Disk Utility once you're booted into the LiveCD desktop:\n\nOnce you've run the checks, make sure your disk isn't full (delete some stuff if you have to) and then reboot.\n\nA: It seems your filesystem has problems, and has mounted itself in \"read only\" mode. There could be a lot of causes.\nI'll go out on a limb and suppose that you have only one root filesystem. Try to reboot like this:\nshutdown -r now -F\n\nThis will mark the filesystem as \"dirty\", and check it on reboot. It doesn't guarantee that it'll fix it, but could help.\nYou could also try to remount the root filesystem in RW mode. Try this as root:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nAnd check if you can write something in /tmp. If you can't, there's not much we can do with the data you provide.

In reading some the questions I find some commands I am not familiar with. I will run a man page on the command and reference the other questions entry to get a better understanding of the command. One was about using chkconfig. Sometimes the command line I reference has a switch that is not referenced in the man page. My question is am I missing something or is there an additional set of information that references more than the man page?\nHere is an example:\nchkconfig  --level 3  squid off\n--level is not listed in the man page. Using the man I would've used chkconfig --edit and worked it that way. Clearly using --level would be the better choice in this instance but it is not listed as a choice in the man page.\n\nA: Sometimes you can find more help with chkconfig --help, info chkconfig, or apropos chkconfig.\nOn this, if you compare the man page for chkconfig on Ubuntu with any other, you'll see that the --level switch seems to have been replaced with the --set switch. While chkconfig on Ubuntu may still use the --level switch, it is not given in the man page, or it is an alias to the --set switch. (The Ubuntu-native equivalent is the update-rc.d command.) \n\nA: Manpages are created by developers. If they add a new feature, it's possible that they forget to update the manpages. The nice thing about open source applications is that you can take a look in the source itself. In the case of chkconfig, you can get the source from http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/maverick/chkconfig. You do not have to understand the language fully, but it can give you an idea.

Ubuntu uses init scripts (man 5 init). Ubuntu's chkconfig manpage is written by someone from SUSE (see the Author section). The Redhat version of the manpage is written by a Redhat developer.\nAgain note that manpages are written by humans. The Internet often contains more extensive guides on commands.\n\nA: You may try info, this will at times give more information than man, as to whether there will be more information on the specific command you would have to check, it is just useful to note that there is another command that gives information about applications and this information is sometimes different, so there may be something there that is missing from the other, as implied, info will at times just use the man pages when it does not have its own.\nExample of difference:\nman uniq gives less than info uniq\nIn fact at the end of the man page it says this:\ninfo coreutils 'uniq invocation'\nshould give you access to the complete manual\nExample of the same, In your case:\nman chkconfig same as info chkconfig\nThe thing here is that you are not just interested in the one command chkconfig so you can use info just to see if you get useful pertinent additional information over the man pages on other commands of interest.\n\nA: Sometimes you will also find useful additional informations in /usr/share/doc.\nDocumentation in the info files can be searched for a string in case you don't know the file description needed to invoke the info command:\ninfo -k 'searchstring'\n\n\nA: There might be some information missing from man pages though I would expect these are rare.

I like RememberTheMilk as a to-do list thing. It syncs well with my android phone, which is important. However, there doesn't seem to be a simple option for syncing RTM with my Ubuntu desktop. I currently use Getting Things Gnome! which is OK, but not ideal: syncing has to be done manually (AFAIK) and weirdly, the extra features of GTG are annoying: since RTM doesn't support subtasks, I'd rather not have the option of subtasks on my desktop to-do widget.\nI can sync RTM with my google calendar and use that through thunderbird, but this had some weird effects: for every day where I had a to do item with a deadline in the future (i.e. every day) I had an all day event in my calendar for that event: doubleplus suboptimal.\nSo is there a better option? Preferably one that fits with thunderbird, since that's where all my other organisational shenanigans are taking place.\n\nA: Tasque  is a simple to-do application for GNOME that has Remember The Milk integration.

I would like to connect to it from my Ubuntu desktop running 10.04. \nI have Remote Desktop Viewer installed. The laptop doesn't show up in the \"nearby\" list but I can see the machine in the list when I go to Machine->Connect and press Find in the resulting panel. Selecting the Mac results in a wait and then a pop up error panel stating: Avahi resolver failure: Timeout reached\nSo my question, is there an easy way to connect from Ubuntu to Mac? If not with Remote Desktop Viewer, then what is the \"preferred\" method?\n\nA: I'm fairly certain that Vinagre, the built in VNC viewer tool has excellent avahi (also known as mDNS or ZeroConf) support.  Bonjour, which is Apple's version of Avahi is, from memory, reasonably compatible.  I've used it both for iTunes library sharing from Mac to Ryhthmbox and VNC sharing - at least back in the days I still used Macs (about two years ago).\nHowever, just to rule out a bug in Vinagre, try the (I think) even better Remmina to see if it can connect :\nsudo apt-get install remmina remmina-gnome\n\nYou can also see what's being broadcast on your network with avahi-utils.  You can install it with\nsudo apt-get install avahi-utils\n\nThen see what's running on your network with \navahi-browse -a\n\nI should also add that Avahi just advertises the conneciton.  You'll still need to know the password to connect - that's set in the Mac settings.  From this older blog post :\n\nAnd you don't need to use Avahi at all if you already know the IP address of the Mac itself.  Just stick it into a new connection profile on either Vinagre or Remmina and you'll be able to specify the password and connect that way.  As I say, Avahi just advertises the service across your local network.\n", "Q: Can I install on 2 separate storage devices?

This changes the breadcrumb buttons temporarily back to the old-style address bar, allowing you to copy the path.\n\nA: In addition to dragging the icon, there are a few ways to get the full path without nautilus (or thunar, konqueror, et al.).   You would then triple-click or click-drag and copy, potentially saving this in your clipboard manager*, and paste it where you need.\n(pastie, klipper, glippy, glipper, anamnesis)\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use find in a directory above your file.  (If you don't know where it is, start where your shell drops you, [generally] in the top of your home directory.)\nfind . | egrep filename \n\n*You can use locate to get the filename.  (Run sudo updatedb if that hasn't been done recently.)\nA more realistic example of using find would be something like :  \n$ find | egrep askubuntu | grep txt\n./askubuntu-temp.txt\n./drDocuments/web/meta.askubuntu.txt\n./other/stuff/askubuntu.txt.iteration.1\n./other/stuff/askubuntu.txt.iteration.2\n[...]\n\nTo cut out the ones you don't like, e.g.: \nfind | egrep askubuntu | grep txt | egrep -v iteration\nfind | egrep askubuntu | grep txt | egrep -v 'iteration|meta|other'\n\nlocate is used much the same way, though grep is frequently more necessary:\nlocate myfile | egrep home | egrep -v 'mozilla|cache|local|bin|\\.pyc|test' | grep \\.py\n\nThis isn't the most efficient way to type this, but usually if I've lost a file, I do this iteratively, adding grep clauses as I go. \n\nA: Easily done in python using os.realpath() function:\n$ python -c 'import os,sys;print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' ./VirtualBox\\ VMs/                                      \n/mnt/HDD/VirtualBox VMs\n\nFrom a related answer,you can also use readlink\n$ readlink -e ./out.txt                                                                                                  \n/home/username/out.txt\n\n\nA: If you simply copy a file in Nautilus, then the full path is copied.\nThen paste it in the terminal. \nBy simply pasting you get:  \nfile:///home/juan/2017/agenda20170101.html\n\nIf you right-click and choose \"Paste filenames\" then you get:  \n'/home/juan/2017/agenda20170101.html'\n\nwith the quotes as shown.\nThis differs from Windows, that copies the file content instead of its name.  \n", "Q: What do I select for \"GRUB install devices\" after an update?

I'm assuming the wrong answer could render my system unable to boot.\nHere's the debconf dialog:\n\nHere's the window and text that is displayed when selecting \"help\" :\n\n\nA: In your case, the correct selection is /dev/sda, the first one. It's the first and only hard disk in your system, whereas /dev/sda1 is a partition on that hard disk. You can install grub on a partition, but it's a \"BAD idea\".\nIf you had multiple hard drives and partitions, first find out where your root partition is:\nlsblk\n\n(See also: How do I find out what hard disks are in the system?)\nYou can then install grub on that hard drive. Look for devices labeled \"disk\" (e.g. \"sda\", meaning /dev/sda) to install grub into the master boot record (every physical disk device has only one MBR, no matter the partitions).\n\nA: This issue was still present when I upgraded Ubuntu 16.04 after a fresh install. To fix it, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The selection of /dev/sda is correct, so press Spacebar for the first option.\n\n*An asterisk appears for the /dev/sda option, signifying successful selection.\n\n*Then press Tab key to highlight the 'OK' button and then press Spacebar key to select the OK action.\n\n\nAfter this, the installation should proceed smoothly.\n", "Q: Is it a bad idea to run SELinux and AppArmor at the same time? My corporate policy says that Linux boxes must be secured with SELinux (so that a security auditor can check the 'yes, we're extremely secure!' checkbox for each server).  I had hoped to take advantage of Ubuntu's awesome default AppArmor security.  Is it unwise to run both Apparmor and SELinux?  (If so, can this bad idea be mitigated with some apparmor and/or selinux tweaks?)\n\nA: The Linux Kernel provides the Linux Security Module interface, of which SELinux and AppArmor are both implementations of. (Others include TOMOYO, Smack, ...) This interface is designed currently to only allow a single LSM to be operational at a time. There is no way to run two simultaneously, so you must choose one. There has been discussion from time-to-time about how to \"stack\" multiple LSMs, but this has not been done yet.\n\nA: I wouldn't use both.\nBoth SELinux and AppArmor do the same basic thing: limiting access to files and folders to only the applications that really need access.\nBut both implement this idea in very different ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*SELinux attaches a label to every file in your filesystem and limits the access of an application to certain labels.\nFor example: Apache can only use files and folder labeled explicitly as web files, and other applications can't.\n\n*AppArmor accomplishes the same thing without using labels, it just uses file paths.\n\n\n(This is a very very basic explanation of how SELinux and AppArmor operate.)\nIf you were to use both they would probably get in each other's way, and I really see no need or advantage to using both.\n\nA: You cannot run both at the same time.  Each of these are \"Major\" LSMs, and it is not possible to stack two major LSMs at once.  ref.\n", "Q: Why am I getting this error while using gedit? \n(gedit:4778): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_ref: assertion `object->ref_count > 0'    failed\n\nWhat does this error mean?\n\nA: This is a harmless message that you will see popup when running most gtk applications on the command line.

The iso's size is 5-20Mb, but the actual install size is of course larger.\n\nThe Minimal CD downloads packages from online archives at installation time instead of providing them on the install CD itself. \n\nJust to add that the final install size can be reduced down to 600MB which will mean a command line system. The same page includes instructions to install low disk space demanding CLI and GUI systems but check the used disk space before continuing from command line system to GUI system.\n\nA: If you have Internet access, you could do a netinstall.  Loading either billix or netboot.me would facilitate that process, and fit on a 512MB flash drive.\n\nA: One possibility is to download and install Madbox 10.10.01 which is a lightweight remix based on Ubuntu 10.10 (32-bit.)

I'm trying to enable dual monitors in Ubuntu. This is working fine, but every time I do it, desktop effects is disabled. I think I've found the reason why, though:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Multihead/\n\nAs with the GNOME XRandR configuration\n  method, setting Virtual to too large a\n  value may result in a loss of hardware\n  acceleration, and thus an inability to\n  use Compiz and its desktop effects.\n\nWhen I use the GNOME monitor applet, or the Monitors configuration in the System menu, the default xrandr settings puts the second monitor to the right of the first, and, as I found with this bug, for most monitors this creates a virtual desktop larger than the maximum 2048 horizontal resolution needed for hardware acceleration on my netbook hardware.\nSo, it seems like if I can modify xrandr's default settings so that it places the new desktop above or below (north or south of) the main LVDS display, then hardware acceleration, and therefore compiz will continue to work. Can anyone tell me, what is the easiest way to achieve this?\nUPDATE: \nI have confirmed that multihead support with desktop effects and hardware acceleration works when I move the external monitor display north of the main LVDS display. Right now this involves the following process: plugging in the external monitor, starting the Monitors configuration menu, desktop effects are disabled automatically (and all of the windows on my workspaces are moved to the first workspace), repositioning the external display so that it is north of LVDS display and clicking apply, and then navigating to the Appearance menu and telling it to reenable desktop effects. Is there a simpler way do this?\nUPDATE 2:\nOK, so I thought that perhaps the GNOME Monitors configuration screen was trying to be clever, and might be disbling desktop effects. So, I just tried using the xrandr command-line client instead, as follows:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --above LVDS1\n\nWhen I do that, desktop effects are still disabled, and I need to manually reenable them. This, despite the fact that hardware acceleration works, and there is never a point where hardware acceleration stops working because the horizontal dimension of the virtual display is too large. So what program is trying to be clever, and is turning off desktop effects when it doesn't need to? And how do I make it stop?\nIf there were a way to re-enable desktop effects from the command line, which I could then put into a script along with the proper xrandr invocation, I would accept that as a workaround.\nUPDATE 3:\nOK, here's my script to enable a second monitor with desktop effects.

I'm not looking for an emulator. I would like to install Windows from within Ubuntu so that I can boot into Windows when I restart my computer. I would install Windows normally but my USB ports are shot and I don't have any optical drives. I'd appreciate any help.\n\nA: If you install Windows, after installing Linux, the windows installation will wipe out your MBR (Master boot record). I think which ever way of install windows (after installing linux) by using a CD, USB, or PXE boot, you wont be able to restore your MBR... Which mean you will not get a ubuntu boot menu (grub or grub2 depends on your version of ubuntu), to select the OS you wish to boot into.\nNow you will have to use ubuntu live cd, or some other live linux cd to boot into linux and restore grub.   \nBut since you donot have USB or CD support. I think the only way is, if you motherboard supports PXE boot. So back to your question, to install windows without USB or CD room, follow link A, link B, link C. Then boot into linux using PXE boot again, restore grub. All the best, it looks too much of tricky work to me. \n\nA: The crazy vmware idea should be doable using raw hard disk access. I did the opposite thing (installing Ubuntu on HDD partition while running Windows using Virtualbox). It was crazy, highly dangerous, yet worked. Even to the point of installing grub on the linux \nI will try this out, and let you know of the results. But for starters, this is how it should work :\n\n\n*\n\n*Run VBox, mount a RAW Partition using vmdk files\n\n*Install Windows inside the VBox.\n\n*Run grub-update, and grub-install to undo anything that Windows might have done to your MBR\n\n\nI will be using Windows xp for my tests, so it might vary.\nAlso another option would be find a way to insert an ISO boot menu into GRUB. I've been looking around for this but it seems that BURG has that option. So, you can boot into the Windows ISO file, and install Windows from there. (Again this is untested, but it is a possibility)\n\nA: Hm. To begin with, you aren't getting anywhere without a windows iso. Hope you backed up that windows cd.\nHere's a long shot possibility. Use a virtualization method that claims to be able to go from vm to physical. I think vmware offers a paid version of their software that will do this. The rest is obvious. Install windows, copy to real partition using vmware.\nWhat will not work is using any ole vm software (like VirtualBox) and just copying the files over. For starters, I think ntldr will be broken. Secondly, a lot of the drivers will be specific to the vm, and will break once exposed to your hardware.\n\nA: I'm afraid you can't do that. While there is Wubi for the opposite situation, there's no way to boot the Windows installer other than from an optical drive or a USB disk.\n(edited out, see comment)\nYou could connect an external (optical) drive via USB (try to use an extension card to provide you with an additional USB port).\n", "Q: How to update to OpenOffice.org 3.3?

I have a netbook with Windows on the second partition and Xubuntu (/ and /home) on the third partition. I selected to encrypt my home folder during installation. The performance of the netbook is adequate for the small machine that it is, but I'm looking to improve performance. I could not find much information about the overhead (CPU or drive) associated with home partition encryption. I ran the following, writing to my home partition as well as the the mounted Windows partition:  \ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/dummy bs=512 count=10240 \ndd if=/dev/zero of=/media/Windows/dummy bs=512 count=10240\nThe first returned 2.4MB/s and the second returned 2.5MB/s.

I'm not sure if the different filesystems will make any difference (/ and /home are ext3).\nUpdate 1 \nI don't know why I didn't use /tmp instead of the mounted Windows folder. Only /home is encrypted, so /tmp is unencrypted ext3. The results of the dd as above are astounding:  \n~: 2.4 MB/s  \n/tmp: 42.6 MB/s\nComments please?

A good summary answer here suggests that performance penalties are only noticeable on small/netbook (Atom) processors and SSDs. \n\nA: dd is NOT a good way to measure HD performance. There are to many variables involved and any good test would need to be done numerious times anyway. \nEncryption generates an overhead especially on the \"lesser\" cpu's that are in netbooks. They are cheaper for a reason after all.\nWhile I do not have data on drive encryption, I did do tests on https vs http for a webserver and the cost is substantial but not lethal. HOWEVER, your home dir tends to be a mess with programs writing to their hidden directories at random constantly. See Firefox for one bad boy in this regard. This is a constant slight slow down on a netbook that is already slower and often as standard has a slow HD. \nRun it again with bonnie++ another user recommended but this time, do it with TWO different users, one with an encrypted HD, the other without. Make sure both home dirs are filled the same. \nThat gives you a far more accurate test. I would not be suprised to see about 20% performance hit or more. That is what my web server did when asked to encrypt everything it put out. And you are reading and writing encrypted data.\n\nA: While encryption for sure will add overhead, encrypting the home partition should not have a big impact on your system's performance. Most of the programs you run are read brom /bin or /usr, and most of the regular system writing is in /var or /tmp.\nOnly your user files are in /home, so you will see impact if processing large files, which I usually put on separate partition anyway, keeping my home for documents only.\n\nA: I have been using the encrypted home directory feature for years and I can tell you that while it behaves fine under normal circumstances it will bring your machine to its knees when doing any kind of intense file operations.\nI have a quad-core Pentium i7 with 16GB of RAM from System7.  By any measure it is a lightening fast laptop with a SATA 7200 RPM drive. Just today when I was unzipping a file with 20,000 small text files in it (take 10 minutes), my system is essentially unusable.  Everything that touches the file system has a 1-2 second delay...including the web browser.  My experience is exactly that of the OP -- the encrypted home directory is about 15x slower than unencrypted.\nI didn't think anything about it because I am so used to it (this is my 4th laptop).  On the wild chance that somebody has a tip on how to improve it, I thought I'd search here.\nI encrypt my home directory because I HAVE to.  If you don't have to...then don't.\n\nA: Transfer speed is hardly a sufficient metric to assess the overhead of encryption: it might simply be that the bottleneck is your hard drive's IO capacity. You might also want to look at CPU usage, it might (or might not) be different whether you use encryption or not.\n", "Q: How to change CapsLock key to produce \"a\"?

But this would in my case mean that instead of writing an a I would  write nothing.\nPositive -> I don't have to rewrite a whole line, but only one character\nNegative -> It's not that obvious that I hit the wrong key, as a missing character is not perceivable as an upper-case line of text.\nI would therefore prefer a possibility to map CapsLock to a . Thus when hitting CapsLock an a character would be written.\nPositive -> If I hit CapsLock instead of a I get the output I actually wanted to type.\nNegative -> If I hit CapsLock in any other context I will get an a character. As I don't ever intentionally use the CapsLock key this would not really pose a problem. (I think, or does it?)\nMy Question:\n\n*\n\n*So how do I change  to a ?\n\n*And is there any case where this could be dangerous/provoke unwanted behaviour?\n\n\nA: Specifically, I don't know how to change CapsLock to a, because I don't remember the keycode. I'll find it a little later. But generally speaking, you can use xmodmap (and .Xmodmap) to change your keymappings. The first time GNOME detects your .Xmodmap file, it'll ask if you want to always load it, and then you're set.\nI also think caps lock is silly. However, the key position is useful. I like mapping it to the Control key. I use control a lot, and it's tiring for my pinky to be constantly reaching down in that awkward position. And as I later found, historically Control is where Caps Lock is currently. Anyway. Create a file in your home directory called .Xmodmap with the following lines:\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Control_L\n\nTo make these changes take effect right this instant, run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap.\nYou can find keycodes on your own using xev. Turns out the keycode for a is 38, or hex 0x61. So instead your .Xmodmap could be:\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = 0x61\n\nI highly recommend reading through the man page, lots of interesting stuff.\n\nA: After looking at man xmodmap, it turns out there is an idempotent way to define this:\nclear Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Caps_Lock Control_L\n\nAfter restarting X, you should be able to run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap repeatedly without getting any \"bad keysym\" errors.\nUpdate: Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be portable and idempotent.\n", "Q: Grub fails to install I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 on a work PC (32bit) to be dual-booting with Win XP.\nMy partition layout is:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda\n\n*-- sda1 - 250gb ntfs WinXP\n\n*/dev/sdb\n\n*-- sdb1 - 160gb ntfs\n\n*/dev/sdc\n\n*-- sdc1 - 161gb ext4 (this is where ubuntu is\n\n*-- sdc5 - 4 gb swap\n\n\nI tried following the suggestion of the answer to this question, but get the following in the terminal as a response:\n\nroot@ubuntu:/# sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n   sudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu\n   /usr/lib/grub/grub-mkconfig_lib: 38: cannot create /dev/null: Permission denied\n   /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for /boot/grub (is /dev mounted?).\n\nHow should I proceed?

What I want is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I plug in my headphones, I want the sound to be un-muted and set to a specific volume level. \n\n*When I unplug my headphones, I want the sound to be muted (or set to a specific volume level).\n\n\nSetting the volume levels isn't the problem, but I somehow need to do this when un-/plugging the headphones, so I'm looking for a way to get notified of those events.\nI quickly found /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 to indicate whether headphones are plugged in or not, so I tried to monitor it using inotifywait and change the volume level based on modified notifications. Unfortunately inotifywait failed because proc isn't an ordinary filesystem.\nAre there other ways to do this (maybe via PulseAudio)?\nAudio device: Intel HDA, audio codec: Conexant CX20585.\n\nTo summarize what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ear Candy: didn't run at all on my system.

The following C program, based on this article, should be able to detect your headphones being plugged or unplugged, after which you can perform whatever actions you want.  \n#include <linux/input.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    int fd = -1;\n    char name[256]= \"Unknown\";\n    struct input_event event;\n\n    if ((fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY)) < 0) {\n        perror(\"evdev open\");\n        exit(1);\n    }\n\n    if(ioctl(fd, EVIOCGNAME(sizeof(name)), name) < 0) {\n        perror(\"evdev ioctl\");\n    }\n\n    printf(\"The device on %s says its name is %s\\n\",\n            argv[1], name);\n\n    read(fd, &event, sizeof(struct input_event));\n    printf(\"Event type is %d\\n\", event.type);\n    printf(\"Event code is %d\\n\", event.code);\n    printf(\"Event value is %d\\n\", event.value);\n\n    close(fd);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThe program takes one argument, which should be a path to the input event device for your headphones.  This is /dev/input/event7 for me, but you may have to try a few to find which it is on your system.  You will need read permissions on that device.  The program will print the name of the device, and the type, code, and value of the first event before exiting.\n\nA: Check dmesg and other log files. Probably plugging in/out fires some particular messages.\nThen, you could use a daemon to parse that log file and detect the events. I think you know what to do from this point :)\n\nA: If you do\namixer sset 'Speaker' playback 0%\n\nthe speaker volume will be muted but headphones will carry on working. Unplugging the headphones means no sound. Which is almost what you want...\nHowever...\nIf you alter the volume control the 'Speaker' volume setting will be set up again. This is because pulseaudio tries to be clever with setting volumes (See http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/PulseAudioStoleMyVolumes for more information). We can stop it from messing with the volumes though.\nOpen /etc/pulse/default.pa\nand find the line\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nand change it to\nload-module module-udev-detect ignore_dB=1\n\nRestart pulseaudio.\nkillall pulseaudio\n\nNow if you mute the speaker volume changing the master volume will not affect it.

I bet drobo\ndoes the same thing.\nFrom the man page.\n   CONTAINER  is  different again.  A CONTAINER is a collection of devices\n   that are managed as a set.  This is similar to the set of devices  con‐\n   nected to a hardware RAID controller.  The set of devices may contain a\n   number of different RAID arrays each utilising some  (or  all)  of  the\n   blocks  from  a  number  of  the  devices in the set.  For example, two\n   devices in a 5-device set might form a RAID1 using the  whole  devices.\n   The  remaining  three  might  have  a RAID5 over the first half of each\n   device, and a RAID0 over the second half.\n\n   With a CONTAINER, there is one set of metadata that  describes  all  of\n   the arrays in the container.  So when mdadm creates a CONTAINER device,\n   the device just represents the metadata.  Other  normal  arrays  (RAID1\n   etc) can be created inside the container.\n\nYou also may be able to convert a RAID 1 MD array into a RAID 5.

I certainly would not issue commands I do not understand but one never knows what can happen.\nI heard that some OS allows the administrator to place some limit on user processes to mitigate the effects of fork bombs, is this protection in Ubuntu by default or would a person with sudo privilege have to set this? If so, how?\n\nA: You can easily limit the amount of processes that can be spawned in Ubuntu and most other Linux distributions by modifying /etc/security/limits.conf\nsudoedit /etc/security/limits.conf\n\nThen add this line to the bottom of that file:\n*    hard     nproc     nnn\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*hard sets the limit at the kernel level so that it cannot be changed without rebooting.\n\n*nproc is the maximum number of processes per user.\n\n*nnn is a number that you should calculate for your system by:\nps aux -L | cut --delimiter=\" \" --fields=1 | sort | uniq --count | sort --numeric-sort | tail --lines=1\n\nThe above command will list all processes for all users including threads, sum them up and list the user name with the largest amount of processes. To be on the safe side, open as many applications as you normally need before running the above command and then double that number for safety.\nAfter this limit is put into place, you'll need to reboot, but it will affect each non-root user on the system. So if a fork bomb is executed by any non-root user it'll have that hard limit.\nGroup and wildcard limits do not apply to the root user by default.\nUse the literal username root in the rules if you want to apply a rule to the superuser.\nAlso, if you're not looking to restart any time soon, you can use sudo ulimit -u 800 which will place the restriction only on the running session but can be easily circumvented by a fork bomb with sudo privileges!\nAfter restart, whatever is in /etc/security/limits.conf will then be used.\nSome additional information about fork bombs: They aren't malware or anything dreadful. They typically consist of something as basic as a script that calls itself twice - thereby growing its presence on the machine exponentially. Even though they have a small memory footprint given the rapid pace they multiple they quickly fill all available RAM and the machine freezes or reboots. The only danger is loosing unsaved information. I would classify a forkbomb much more as a prank than malicious software.\nAn important reminder:\nYou should rarely ever execute anything in command line when you aren't 98% certain of its action. If you can't read the commands you're executing - don't do it. This applies double to unreadable chunks of hex/base64 characters, which can be used to obscure all sorts of nastiness.

I am using dual boot (Vista and Ubuntu). There aren't any problems related to heat and fan while using Vista. However with Ubuntu, the laptop overheats and the fans make noise. I tried to solve this problem with cpu scaling but that doesn't work. Should I update the BIOS? \n\nA: Yes, your first option would be to update the BIOS. Dell produces updates quite often and they solve issues such as powersaving related ones.\nThe most common reason why a computer overheats in Linux is that the DSDT tables of the BIOS are buggy for Linux. Some users have gone the extent of fixing the DSDT tables themselves, such as at HOWTO Fix A Buggy DSDT File\nHowever, I recommend to apply the latest official BIOS update and check again.\n\nA: I had this same problem, on the same laptop model.\nThe issue is with the opensource driver. When I replaced the default opensource driver with the FLGRX driver my idle temperature dropped by about 30 degrees. The fan is coming on because the laptop is so hot, With FLGRX driver the laptop will run much cooler and so the fan will spend a lot more time off or at low speed.\nThe opensource driver is probably doing permanent damage to your hardware by causing it to overheat.\nThere is a launchpad bug for this.

I had to do this with a game called Tibia which is a CPU hog on Ubuntu, its now limited to 50% CPU with cpulimit.\n\nA: Additionally - you can try installing CPULIMIT and control the beast's cpu consumption. I had this problem with my DELL N5010 & I couldn't do anything with the fan speed. Installed CPULIMIT and throttled the Video conversion utility. I am able to get things done without my Laptop crashing - though, the speed is compromised. Well - I guess it is about to be the case - and better than looking for a fan replacement (or whatever else).\n", "Q: Flash Breaking Pulseaudio? Since posting this question, it has been revealed that the problem was with mpd — not Flash. Here is the question I posted in an attempt to find a fix.\nEvery time a Flash object with sound (such as a video) loads in my browser (Chromium or Firefox), it seems to break Pulseaudio. Further Flash content will play just fine, but other software, such as MPD, will not be heard. I can reset this problem by ensuring that no instance of Flash are running in my browser and running pulseaudio -k, but the problem just comes back as soon as another Flash object initialises.\nIn being a little more specific, if I have sound playing (such as with MPD) and load a Flash object, sound continues to play but Flash doesn't output any sound. If I stop playing sound and then load the Flash object, Flash gets sound and seemingly takes control of Pulseaudio until pulseaudio -k.\nMay or may not be related: When Flash doesn't get to output sound it tends to crash Chromium. I can't say if this is only when Flash gets control of Pulseaudio or not, as it doesn't always crash.\nI'm running the latest version of Flash, just downloaded and installed from Adobe's site using their 32-bit deb. I have tried flashplugin-installer but the problem is the same. Running Ubuntu 10.10.\nAny idea how I can fix this, or why it's happening? Does it matter that I'm running mpd as root?\n\nA: The problem to solve is to get the Music player Daemon to play properly with pulseaudio\nYou can check that your copy of MPD includes PulseAudio support by running mpd --version and making sure \"pulse\" is in the list of supported outputs. this is the case on Ubuntu now so it is just a matter of getting mpd to work well with pulseAudio.\nRead more here;\nhttp://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/PulseAudio\nHopefully you will be pointed to something that can help you to configure MPD with pulseAudio.\n", "Q: Virtualbox Guest (Win 7 host) locks up on network access I've got Ubuntu 10.10 installed on a virtual machine (VirtualBox).

I understand there is a safer, more targeted way to troubleshoot AppArmor's possible contribution to an issue than completely stopping the service and tearing down AppArmor profiles.  Can someone give me the details, and the advantages of the better approach?\n\nA: Here's what I was thinking of (from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor ) -- \"complain mode\" .  This doesn't address the issue of relative merits or consequences of this versus other debugging methods.  \n\nWhen debugging, it may also be useful\n  to put apparmor into 'complain' mode.\n  This will allow your application to\n  function normally while apparmor\n  reports accesses that are not in the\n  profile. To enable 'complain' mode,\n  use:\nsudo aa-complain /path/to/bin\n\nwhere '/path/to/bin' is the absolute\n  path to the binary, as reported in the\n  'profile=...' portion of the 'audit'\n  entry. Eg:\nsudo aa-complain /usr/sbin/slapd\n\nTo re-enable enforcing mode, use\n  'aa-enforce' instead:\nsudo aa-enforce /path/to/bin\n\nTo disable a profile:\nsudo touch /etc/apparmor.d/disable/path.to.bin\nsudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/path.to.bin\n\n\nWhen troubleshooting then, if there is something broken that appears to be related to a spooky permissions problem ('Hmm, looks like access control, but it's not a Unix permissions problem, or an NFS issue, or PAM issue, or a media mounting goof, etc. -- perhaps it's AppArmor.'), Kees Cook points out  that best course of action is too check your system logs.

You can only do this as root and if you do it as non-root it will simply print the list of known networks without refreshing.\n", "Q: Display workspace's number? is there a way to somehow display the number (or identifier) of the current workspace in ubuntu 10.10?\n\nA: You could use Indicator-Workspaces:\n\nScreenshot from omgubuntu.co.uk\n", "Q: Missing Dropbox indicator-applet icon, how do I get it back? I'm currently running Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit and wanted to change my Dropbox indicator-applet icon to make it look more uniform with the other icons. I found this suggestion of a PPA and package to try and followed these instructions: How can I change Dropbox's indicator applet icon?\nThis worked fine, however, after deciding that I didn't like those icons I uninstalled them via a sudo apt-get autoremove monochrome-icons-extra then did a ppa-purge on that PPA. I then stopped and started Dropbox and at that point was missing an icon all together. I can click in the empty space where the Dropbox icon should be and get the drop-down menu, so I know Dropbox is running. I also confirmed this buy running dropbox status and it returned idle. I tried rebooting but that didn't make a difference, the icon still wont show up.\nNext I tried reinstalling Dropbox via sudo apt-get --reinstall install nautilus-dropbox, that had no effect. I then tried to completely remove everything and reinstall. To accomplish this I did the following:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove nautilus-dropbox\nrm ~/.dropbox ~/.dropbox-dist ~/.dropbox-dist-new\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dropbox*\n\nI then went to dropbox.com and downloaded the latest .deb and installed it that way and the icon was still missing, ARGH!\nThrough a little research, I discovered that the PPA installed the icons to to /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/status/22/dropboxstatus-*.svg and that's how it changed the icons. The images aren't there any more (having uninstalled the PPA), but when I checked on my laptop where Dropbox is working fine, there aren't any other icons in that location, either.\nWhat is going on and how do I fix this?\n\nA: From what I can gather the icons are in /usr/share/icons/[theme]/[resolution]/apps/dropbox.png.  \nYou can confirm that you have them in that location by running find /usr/share/icons/ -name 'dropbox.png'.\nIf they are missing on your machine and present on your laptop, then you can just copy them over and that could just fix it.\n* update *\nThe status icons are in \n/usr/share/icons/[theme]/status/[resolution]/\nThe names of the default status icons are\n\n\n*\n\n*dropboxstatus-busy.png\n\n*dropboxstatus-blank.png\n\n*dropboxstatus-busy2.png\n\n*dropboxstatus-logo.png\n\n*dropboxstatus-idle.png\n\n*dropboxstatus-x.png\n\n\nI hope that helps you narrow down the search.\n\nA: Going by the info found in this dropbox update and the subsequent OMG! Ubuntu! article regarding that update, it would seem the files you need are (should be) in\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/status/\n\nAlso be sure that your per-user setting doesn't ruin things. Check (I think it should be that one anyway) :\n~/.icons/hicolor/22x22/status/\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have dropbox installed or anything, so this is mostly assumptions combined.\n\n*Depending on your theme, I guess it is possible that the values from hicolor get overwritten.\n\n*That update link at the beginning also contains a tar that holds the icons incase you need them.\n\n\nA: i used the dbus-launch method to get the dropbox icon back (see here:\nDropbox icon in tray is missing)\n. However i appended --exit-with-session to the dbus-launch command.\nThis way i achieved that the dropbox icon is still visible after logount and login. Without that option i got it only when i completely rebooted the system.\nHere is the complete command:\ndbus-launch --exit-with-session dropbox start -i\n", "Q: Use webcam to sense lighting condition and adjust screen brightness Is there a way to have my webcam sense lighting conditions and adjust screen brightness accordingly?\n\nA: Take a look into the RedShift project, which changes the screen temperature based on your geographic location as F.Lux was formerly doing.\nhttp://jonls.dk/redshift/\nInstructions on installing and how to use are well documented in the website and, depending on your hardware and monitor you can feel your eyes like \"refreshed\" by the nice effect which is achieved by RedShift.\n\nA: To add the PPA, press Ctrl+Alt+T on keyboard to open the terminal.

Follow these instructions to choose the font (first select UTF-8 and then the combination of characters you need, Extended Latin, Latin+Cyrillic+Greek etc).\n\nA: You should install the console-data package.\nIf you've already installed this package, reconfigure it using \ndpkg-reconfigure console-data\n\nAnd select the correct keyboard disposition.\n\nA: There is a program unicode_start that puts the console in Unicode mode.\nIn addition, the console can support a codepage of 256 (or 512) characters only at any given time, so you need to make sure that you have loaded a console font with the appropriate characters.\nThe Linux kernel maintainers do not accept patches for better Unicode support on the console because the console is to be used as an emergency interface. What needs to be done is write a terminal emulator for the Linux framebuffer that undertakes the support for Unicode. Something like a 'getty' replacement. This aspect of open-source development did not receive yet much attention.\nAnother deficiency with the existing Unicode of the Linux console is that you cannot use dead keys.\n", "Q: Network Manager Applet menu freezes and does not respond Since the latest update in Ubuntu 10.10, the nm-applet has started doing some strange things.

A fix has been issued for Natty, but is not in the Maverick repos yet.  So Ubuntu sees the newer version in elementary-desktop, uses that instead of the canonical one and, hence, the bug.  \nThe solution is to roll back the version of network-manager-gnome to the 0.8.1+git.20100809t190028.290dc70-0ubuntu3 from 0.8.2+git.20101123t161608.f143e76-0ubuntu1\nThis can be done from synaptic by searching for network-manager-gnome and then clicking 'force version' in the package menu and selecting the 0.8.1 version.\n\nA: No need to force it anymore, that have taken 0.82 out.

Click the forward button and check your Separator, usually Space.\nlook below and see if the structure looks OK then you can select finish. gnumeric will neatly place the copied text into the spreadsheet recreating the table there for you, \nThe table can now be copied from gnumeric and pasted into your Openoffice.org writer document, or you can paste from gnumeric to calc first and then format, then it is a simple matter of copying and pasting the formatted calc table in writer.\nIf the tables are complex and have wrapped text in the headings then you can copy the headings first, individully or the whole row, paste them and fix them up in gnumeric then copy the data section and paste under the headings.\nThis may seem a bit long but it is much better than retyping the data or pasting text directly into a word processor that often times will need tedious editing to look good.\nIf you do not mind a bit-mapped table you can use the Snapshot tool in Adobe Acrobat Reader to Marquee select the table area and paste it into your word processor, on many occasions when you do not care about editing the table this will work.\n\nA: I would argue the industry standard for PDF tables extraction is Tabula\nhttps://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula\n\nA: You can also install Acroread in your system and have all the functions of the software on it.\nhttp://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/\nIn synaptic insert the next software sources:\ndeb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu maverick partner\ndeb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu maverick partner\n\nThis can be done by opening \"System/Administration/Synaptic Package Manager\" (enter your password when required).\nIn synaptic go to Settings/Repositories and click the \"Other software\" tab and you will get a window like this:\n\nClick the \"Add\" button and enter the software sources that I previously provided you, one line at once.\n\nWhen finished, perform a refresh by clicking the \"Reload\" button or by dropping the next command in a terminal (NOTE: this command can only be done with Synaptic Package Manager closed)\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, again in synaptic, perform a search for \"acroread\" and mark it for install. Apply the changes and enjoy.\nNOTE: If you opted to use the terminal to install, just add the repositories to the software sources, close synaptic and run the next in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install acroread\n\n\nA: Okular has a \"Copy table\" tool\n", "Q: What Activities Stop Computer from Sleeping I generally set up power hungry servers with a fairly short timeout before they're supposed to suspend or hibernate, but they seem to occasionally go to sleep during file transfers, ssh sessions, etc. What sort of activities are considered \"activity\" of the sort that will keep the machine awake?\n\nA: As someone above has posted in a comment, it seems to be mouse or keyboard activity that keeps the machine awake. I'm not marking this answer correct, as it's not really mine, and I can't guarantee it's accurate at this point.\n", "Q: Linux Kernel won't update to 2.35.25 My recent linux kernel version is 2.35.24. Yesterday, there was an update which is 2.35.25 but after the update, my kernel version is still stuck at 2.35.24. Is there any option to get it to 2.35.25?\n\nA: Did the update install?\nThere are lots of reasons why a kernel update would refuse to install, perhaps your machine is blacklisted because of known issues.\nTo find out what kernels you have installed, use this command:\nls /lib/modules/\n\nTo find out which one you're using, use this command:\nuname -r\n\nWhen you boot, you can press [Esc] to get the grub menu, what does the grub menu show. You can select any of the installed kernels from this list too. You can show this list while booted like so:\ncat /boot/grub/grub.cfg | grep echo\n\nIf it's not there and it's not installed, attempt to install it from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.32-25-generic\n\nIf the version is installed, but not listed, then you might have a configuration issue, and you should be able to run this to fix it:\nsudo update-grub2\n\n\nA: There may be those that disagree, but, I have found that going into Synaptic, searching for Linux...\nmaking sure the headers and image for the set you are wanting are installed (and have been installed in the correct order)\neg for the Kernel you want would have:\nheaders ...\nheaders for your bit config\nimage for your bit config\nIf all are not there, find a source and install all 3 in THIS ORDER\nthe headers for all (the 'deb' would say all.deb)\nthe headers for you bit configuration (32 or AMD64)\nthe image for your bit configuration (32 or AMD64)\nupdate grub2\nrestart, checking to see which version you are running, at that time..\nIf running the correct version, and you don't want to go back...\nYou can simplify some of what is next with 'ailurus' but, basically, if nothing else,\nOr:\nGo back to synaptic and remove the other 'older' kernels.AFTER MAKING SURE YOU HAVE NEWER ONES RUNNING!!!\nBriefly:\nRe-install the newer kernel in the correct order.\nRestart\nMake sure all three of the newer kernel parts are up in Synaptic.\nUpdate Grub2\nRestart.\nCheck again to make sure the 'newer kernel' is up...\nIf you then want, get rid of older kernels through Synaptic or other package.\n", "Q: Is this a kernel panic? \n\nwhat's the meaning of all that mess?\n\nA: It's what's known as a \"kernel oops,\" a superset of kernel panics. If this is a new installation of Ubuntu, the problem is most likely due to corruption of the installation media.\nIf it's not a new installation, try loading an older kernel by holding Shift during boot to access Grub's boot menu. If that starts up alright, you can report a bug by running ubuntu-bug linux-image-2.6.35-24-generic.\n", "Q: How do I disable the \"Fn\" keys on a laptop? I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to disable the fn key on my laptop?\n\nA: Check your laptop's BIOS. Most of the BIOS handles how to change (or remove) functionality of those special keys. I have just done this in order to change the order of [Fn] and left [Ctrl] keys but I remember there is an option to cancel the [Fn] key.\n\nA: I recently had a similar problem with CapsLock and fixed it with xmodmap\nYou would only have to find out the code for fn, perhaps you will find it in the man page of xmodmap.\nUpdate:\nRefering to thinkwiki.com the keycode for fn should be 227 and the keysym F35\nSo the xmodmap syntax to disable fn could be remove Lock = F35\nI have not tested it.\n\nA: Press Fn+Esc will toggle between enabling/disabling Fn-key functions.\nYou can also press Ctrl+Shift+T.\n", "Q: Why is there no 64-bit release of the Netbook Edition? Why is there not a 64-bit version of Ubuntu netbook edition around? Now that there are 64-bit Atoms around, I think it would make sense (more CPU registers etc)..(?)\n\nA: I imagine it's probably because the 64-bit Atoms are a more recent phenomenon, and the Ubuntu folks just haven't gotten around to it. However, if you really wanted a 64-bit version of the Netbook Remix, I think you could get it - as long as you're willing to do a bit of extra work.\nIf you downloaded and installed the Minimal 64-bit Ubuntu installation and then installed the ubuntu-netbook and ubuntu-netbook-default-settings packages, you would effectively have a 64-bit version of the Netbook Edition.\nI've always run into a couple \"interesting\" issues when installing from the minimal system, but I think that might be your best bet until they release the official version.\n", "Q: How do I download the command-line emacs instead of the GUI one? I used sudo apt-get install emacs to download emacs. I expected the command-line emacs to start when I ran emacs but instead the GUI emacs started.\nHow can I download the command-line emacs?\n\nA: The command-line emacs is installed along with the GUI.\nTo run it, use the -nw option. An explanation from man emacs:\n\n-nw, --no-window-system\nTell  Emacs  not  to  use its special interface to X.  If you use\nthis switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1) window,  display\nis done in that window.\n\nSo run the following command to use emacs from the command-line:\nemacs -nw\n\n\nIf you don't want to have to type emacs -nw, you could create an alias.\nPut the following line in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases:\nalias emacs=\"emacs -nw\"\n\nYou can add this alias in one line by using I/O Redirection::\necho alias emacs=\\\"emacs -nw\\\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: If possible, delete the old version of emacs, then reinstall the version without X. The * on the end of the command is important and will save you from a world of pain.\napt-get remove emacs*\napt-get install emacs-nox\n\nYou can also specify the version of emacs without X to install, such as emacs23-nox or emacs24.nox rather than installing the alias package.\nSure, you can mess with bash aliasing or pass in -nw, but when you use sudo, or emacs is summoned by git, you'll see that X window once again.\n\nA: That would be emacs-nox I believe.  This is the meta-package that currently points to emacs24-nox . \n\nDescription: The GNU Emacs editor\n  (without X support)\n\nSo, just as before but with that package:\nsudo apt-get install emacs-nox\n\nor alternatively\nsudo apt-get install emacs24-nox\n\n\nFor cases like this, where you wonder what's in what package, try this : \napt-cache search ^emacs \n\nthen\n apt-cache show <whateverpackage>\n\n\nA: You already have installed it.\nJust run emacs with:\nemacs -nw\n\n\nA: I think I accidentally downgraded a post without intending to. emacs -nw is the correct option.\nI just get tired of the vi/emacs flame warz. If the original post didn't mention vi, then mentioning vi doesn't help.\nBesides, emacs has a vi mode in it - viper-mode.\n", "Q: Do I need to install a bootloader while upgrading a virtual machine? I have a virtualization server which is having a few virtual machines running at top of it. All this was done using Ubuntu server edition with KVM and using virt-manager on SSH connection.\nThese VMs are Lucid 10.04 64 bit Vms. When I upgrade them via\napt-get upgrade  on an SSH connection in between the ncurses screen, it asks me if it should install a bootloader and to select Yes or No for it. \nI have no clue what should I select here and I cancel the upgrade.Since it is a production machine I can not specify any thing like this. So let me know what will be a correct.\n\nA: This depends on how the machine boots. You'll need a boot loader if your machine is not set up for 'direct kernel boot'\nYou can check this by opening virt-manager, looking at the properties for the virtual machine, and selecting the 'boot options' configuration panel. If the 'Kernel path' setting is set (it's under the 'Direct kernel boot' drop-down), then the OS will be loaded by KVM, and you don't need a bootloader.\nIf this is empty, then you will need a bootloader to load the kernel from the virtual disk.\nYou can also check this parameter with virsh:\nvirsh dumpxml <virtual-machine>\nthis will dump the KVM configuration data for the machine. Look for the <os> tag. If it has a <kernel> tag, like this:\n\n    <os>\n     <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-0.11'>hvm</type>\n     <kernel>/var/lib/libvirt/images/vmlinuz-2.6.32-29-server</kernel>\n     <initrd>/var/lib/libvirt/images/initrd.img-2.6.32-29-server</initrd>\n     <cmdline>root=/dev/vda console=ttyS0 ro debug nosplash</cmdline>\n     <boot dev='hd'/>\n    </os>\n\nThen the kernel will be loaded with KVM, and no bootloader is required. If there is no <kernel> tag, you need a bootloader.\n\nA: KVM hosts full installation of other OS, thus you have to have \"the usual stuff\" you have on system, and that includes bootloader, that will boot when KVM starts to run image/partition when your KVM tries to start that VM.\nIn your case, I would test exactly how everything happens as no amount of reading will fix your production server instantly if you manage to corrupt something.\nMaking backup of working VM files is also a good idea.\n", "Q: Format password protected USB flash on ubuntu My flash disk is password protected. When I plugged it into my Ubuntu machine I didn't see the flash disk appear, but when I plugged it into Windows I can see the drive but can't open the drive. It gives me the option to \"format\" but when I click on \"format\" it says \"password protected\".\nIs there a way to format my drive and back to the original?\n\nA: I don't have any experience with password protected flash drives but most probably password protection is a software feature and not the hardware one. If that is the case then you can run gparted on ubuntu and delete the current partition(s) on your flash, then recreate a partition(s) and format it to your desired file system.\nTo install gparted use:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nyou can then run it System->Administration->gparted\nUpdate:\nYour disk may be failing, try running \nsudo badblocks -v /dev/sdb \n\nif the ouput from this command says zero bad blocks then try write mode test to make sure that your disk is fine. Use \nsudo badblocks -v -w /dev/sdb\n\nfor write mode test.\n", "Q: Building a .deb file, install dependencies too I am part of a small team that develop an intranet web app. We want to a method of easy installation, so we were thinking about how apt-get works, especially with installing dependencies.\nOur app has many dependencies (PHP5, PostgreSQL, FOP etc) but we need control over who has access to the installation.  With this in mind we started looking at building our own .deb file. It looks like I can define the dependencies in my control file but when we try to install the .deb file using dpkg, the dependencies are checked, fail and the installation stops.\nWhat I did then was to run a apt-get -f install command to run the installation again with dependencies, but I don't want to do this.\nSo here's the question, is there a way that a .deb file can install the dependencies automatically, just like and apt-get install abc would?\nBasically we want to make the installation as simple as possible, therefore we don't want the end user to be running any command that isn't absolutely necessary.\n\nA: Gdebi\ngdebi installs a deb package and its dependencies. To use it run:\nsudo gdebi package.deb\n\nIn newer versions of Ubuntu, this is not installed by default, so you will need to install it from the repositories.\nSee man gdebi for a full list of options.\ngdebi is the command line equivalent to the graphical tool of the same name that used to be included by default in Ubuntu. The command for the graphical tool is gdebi-gtk and has similar functionality:\n\n\nA: Now, this is already handled by Software Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-Click on any deb file will launch Software Center\n\n*Press install and it will download dependencies\n\n", "Q: Chinese font with no smoothing got set as default after installing Chinese Languge Support (how to disable it?)

After that, type in a terminal\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot.\nFYI: This changes the so-called scheduler to 'deadline'.\nSource: http://techtitbits.com/2010/04/get-rid-of-freeze-ups-during-disk-io-activity-in-ubuntu/\n================================================================================\nAnother Possibility would be to lower dirty_ratio settings.\nTo test it, type in a terminal:\nsudo bash -c \"echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\"\nIf this helps, make it permanent by editing your sysctl.conf:\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\nAt the end of the file, add the following lines:\nvm.dirty_ratio=10\nvm.dirty_background_ratio=5\nSave, close and reboot. Done.\n\nA: Are you using Ubuntu One? I'm experiencing similar problems with U1 after boot.\nYou can try opening System Monitor (should be under System > Administration) at boot and see if ubuntuone-syncdaemon (or another program) is hogging the hard disk. Or better yet, download a program called iotop, and run it from Terminal right after boot. It'll show which program is responsible for the high I/O wait.\n", "Q: Change swap memory size after adding RAM? I ordered some addon RAM a few days ago to install on my Ubuntu 10.10 stationary computer and while giving it some thought, I remember that I previously did change the SWAP memory file size on a XP computer after doing a RAM upgrade in the past. \nShould I change the SWAP memory size (increase?) after installing more RAM into my computer?\n\nA: The swap partition is used to\n\n\n*\n\n*move temporarily running programs that are not active,so that to make space for the programs being used.\n\n*for hibernation, where your entire RAM is copied to the swap partition. \n\n\nTherefore, if you will be using hibernation, you should have a swap at least as big as your RAM, and a bit more just in case.\nA rule of thumb is to make a swap partition as big as twice your RAM but not go over 3GB (because you will be wasting space).\nIt is OK to create a second swap partition and have them both active. Linux uses them as if they were a continuous swap partition, so it is fine.\nTypically, if you have over 3GB of RAM, then you will notice that Ubuntu will not have a use of your swap. Run the free command and notice the value for Swap: + used. In most cases it just stays to 0.\n\nA: Only if you think you are going to need it.  If you are going to hibernate the machine, you need the swap at least as big as your ram.\nMore Info can be found at this Ubuntu FAQ on Swap Space .  It also talks about how to change/add space.\n", "Q: File Permissions on files copied from USB do not match File Permissions of files I create in Ubuntu When I create a file in Ubuntu, it creates with only read/write permissions for the owner. But if I copy a file from a fat32 USB drive, the file permissions give read/executable powers to Owner,Group and Others.\nHow do I make files copied from a USB drive adopt the same file permissions as other files in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Unix-like ownership and permissions are not compatible with fat or ntfs filesytems.  If you need your permissions to stick when copied to another drive, better format it with an ext* type filesystem.  If it's a flash drive, better yet with ext2 to reduce writes to the drive.  The downfall is that it will render the drive unreadable in windows (and unbootable if you use it for instalations).  Another way is to make an archive (.tar.gz) with the file(s) and copy the archive, that way you'll preserve the permissions.\n\nA: To set permissions for copied files that come from a non-Unix filesystem such as FAT32 use\nrsync --chmod=CHMOD source destination\nwhere CHMOD is your desired permissions for the copied file(s). Replace CHMOD by e.g. 0644 will give read/write access to the owner and read-only acess to all other users. For further copy options see rsync manpage.\n\nA: The best answer that I can give you is to use a UNIX/Linux based archival tool, like tar(1) or cpio(1).  That will preserve the date and permissions of the file(s), but the archive file itself we don't really care about. tar cf /media/stickdrive/foobar.tar path/to/my/file\n", "Q: Problems with certificate with wget and github lately Lately, I have received errors while using wget against github on ubuntu 10.04. \nERROR: certificate common name `*.github.com' doesn't match requested host name `github.com'.\nTo connect to github.com insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.\n\nDoes anyone know why this error ocours and how to fix it (without --no-check-certificate).\n\nA: Apparently, github.com is no longer using a wildcard certificate, and they use a certificate specifically for github.com.\nYou need to obtain the new SSL certificate for github.com and put that in your system's certificate store, in /etc/ssl/certs.\nYou can get the new certificate using the command\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect github.com:443\n\nIn any case, the certificate is\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\nD03DXDfrYYjxmWjTRdO2GdbYnt1ToEgxyA==\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nOnce you put it in /etc/ssl/certs, wget will recognise it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu chroot “No such file or directory” I have a web application where I create some folders on my server and put executables there. Then I try to run them with chroot but I get a message that access is denied there.\nI tried chmod -R 777 blah blah.... and then I get a message that the folder or the file that I call (sudo chroot mydirectory myfile_inside_Mydirectory) does not exist. This happens only when I call chroot on folders created by the web server. My web application is in php and I use:\nshell_exec(\"cp -R /var/www/comp/prison/bin $dir\");\n\nshell_exec(\"cp -R /var/www/comp/prison/lib $dir\");\n\nshell_exec(\"cp /var/www/janitor.out $dir/janitor.out\");\n\nshell_exec(\"sudo chmod -R 777 $dir\");\n\n$process = proc_open(\"sudo chroot $dir janitor.out\", $descriptorspec, $pipes);\n\nsudo does not need password.\n\nA: Well I finally found out that I copied the required libraries on wrong folder, because when I tested chroot for first time I was on a 32bit Ubuntu Machine, while my server is 64bit. So, I copied the required libraries and bin/sh at the proper folders at my directory that I would like to jail and it worked just fine. :D Thanks you all!\n\nA: What kind of file is janitor.out? If it's dynamically linked, you'll also need the linked libraries, which on their turn might need other libraries as well. You can use the ldd program to check which shared libraries are required. For example, the output of ldd /bin/ls:\n    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffac983000)\n    libselinux.so.1 => /lib/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f8adda8f000)\n    librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007f8add887000)\n    libacl.so.1 => /lib/libacl.so.1 (0x00007f8add67e000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8add2fb000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f8add0f7000)\n    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8addccc000)\n    libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f8adced9000)\n    libattr.so.1 => /lib/libattr.so.1 (0x00007f8adccd4000)\n\nAnd ldd /lib/libacl.so.1:\n        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffd462f000)\n        libattr.so.1 => /lib/libattr.so.1 (0x00007f4e348aa000)\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4e34527000)\n        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4e34cd6000)\nIf one of these libraries are not satisfied, the program will report \"No such file or directory\", even if the program itself exist.\n\nEdit: the following more likely the problem in this case. I'm keeping the above answer because it could be helpful to someone with the same error message.\nYou are running:\nsudo chroot $dir janitor.out\n\nThis will cause the chroot to search for janitor.out in $PATH (/bin, /sbin, ...). You need to prefix janitor.out with a slash in order to run janitor.out, located in the root of your chroot:\nsudo chroot $dir /janitor.out\n\n", "Q: Fonts DPI problem in Firefox and Open Office I have changed fonts DPI from 96 to 85.

The directory is quite large (around 100000 files). ls piped to head takes an awful long time to complete.\n\nEdit:\n\n*\n\n*Filesystem is ext3.\n\n*limiting the number of files in the folder is not worth the effort, since this is going to be a rare \"clean-up\" operation and files are generated by a 3rd party software. \n\n\n*Using file modified time, instead of the creation time provides and acceptable solution.\n\n\n\nA: Another way if found of doing things today might be relevant to your performance issues:\nI=0; ls -cr /dir/ | while read file; do I=`expr $I + 1`; echo \"$file\"; if [ $I == 100 ]; then break; fi; done\n\nThat should in theory start outputting a lot faster but I guess it depends where the lag is coming from. It could just be taking ls a long time to sort the files.\n\nA: You say that \"ls piped to head takes an awful long time to complete\".\nThe cause of this is not ls, but the number of files in your directory.  If you have 100,000 files in a single directory, any way of solving this problem would have to get information about all 100,000 files before it could even think about sorting them or printing any output.\nIf it's taking too long, the real solution is to split the files over multiple directories.\nIf you can't spread the files over several directories, is there any way you can narrow down the number of files to consider?  e.g. if the file names include a date, maybe you can include a wildcard so the system doesn't have to sort 100,000 files.  Or maybe they're sequentially numbered? (This may or may not help, but is worth trying.)\nHow many times are you trying to do this?  Maybe it's worth saving/caching the output for re-use.\n\nNow, a question.\nAre you sure you mean \"creation time\" and not \"change time\"?  Most tools can only display \"change time\", not \"creation time\".\nGetting \"creation time\" is a very new thing, which requires an ext4 filesystem, and some tools that aren't easy to install.\n\nIf you want change time\nChange time (ctime for short) means the time the attributes of the file last changed.\nls -c sorts by ctime.\nYou want the output in ascending order, not descending, so you need to reverse the output with the -r option too.\nSo you could do it like this:\nls -cr | head -n 100\n\nA longer solution to the same problem using stat:\nfind . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -exec stat -c $'%Z\\t%n' '{}' \\; |\n    sort -k 1n |\n    cut -f 2 -d $'\\t' |\n    head -n 10 |\n    sed -e 's/^\\.\\///'\n\nbut that runs slower than ls -cr on my system.\n\nIf you want modification time\nModification time (mtime for short) means the time the contents of the file last changed.\nls -t sorts by mtime.\nChange ls -cr to ls -tr (best option) or change stat -c $'%Z\\t%n' to stat -c $'%Y\\t%n'.\n\nIf you need creation time\n(crtime for short)\nThis is harder.\nFirst, ensure the directory is on a filesystem that is formatted using ext4.  You can use tune2fs -l <device name> to check this.\nThen, there is a new stat format called %W, which can help you here.  To get it, you'll have to download a version of GNU Coreutils released in October 2010 or after, extract it, compile it, and install it.\nThen, depending on your kernel, this might work (haven't tried it).\nfind . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -exec stat -c $'%W\\t%n' '{}' \\; |\n    sort -k 1n |\n    cut -f 2 -d $'\\t' |\n    head -n 10 |\n    sed -e 's/^\\.\\///'\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*stat read crtime from ext4\n\n*a Ruby script to access crtime on Linux\n\nIf you get errors about \"'$\\t'\nThe '$\\t' notation requires bash or zsh: it will not work in dash or sh on Ubuntu.  If you really need to use those shells, you will need to change any \\t to Ctrl+V, Tab and remove the leading $ from just before the opening quote.\n", "Q: Motion eye webcam and micro doesn't work I'm having problems with my motion eye webcam and my microphone. it doesnt work on Ubuntu... i already tested it with cheese, empathy and pidgin, but ubuntu doesnt recognize it.\nMy system:\n\n\n*\n\n*sony vaio vgn fz21s \n\n*RAM: 2GB\n\n*graphics: nvidia geforce 8600m gs \n\n*cpu: intel centrino duo 2.2 ghz \n\n*harddrive: 320 gb\n\n\nA: we need more information about your hardware in order to understand exactly what it is and how it's failing to work, you can follow the instructions in the question here:\nI have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into?\nIt's likely at this stage that the makers of your webcam have not provided any documentation or drivers to get your hardware working.

You can do this in /etc/updatedb.conf under PRUNEPATHS. You can also prune file systems (like nfs, if you so desire).\n\nA: On one of my systems that acts as a backup server, mlocate.db hit 9GB.  The solution was to exclude the backup directories from locate, since I had no need to search them.\nI did this by adding the backup directory to PRUNEPATHS in /etc/updatedb.conf.\nRunning sudo updatedb then reduced it to 1.6MB (and saves a huge amount of time indexing all of those files).\n\nA: 800MB sounds pretty much.

Although I am not a professional programmer, I have written a program or two. Yet, nowadays every engineer and scientist learns to program a bit as well, and as such I am used to writing programs in Python, C and MATLAB. Now I want to give back a bit to Ubuntu and its great folks and fix a bug!\nI had a look at the list of the bitesize campaign and had to find that most of them are not that easy for me to fix as I suspect they require a lot of time to get into the matter, and I do not have that. Still I discovered this one and it looks manageable and like a cool feature to me. \nAs I have never written a patch or released a program to the wild before though, I have no idea where to start. What should be my first step to tackle that problem? \nBottom line: Where and how do I start fixing that guy?\n\nA: Answering this question can get long and complicated, so I am instead going to point you to resources available instead of rehashing them here.\nDocumentation\n\n*\n\n*Getting Set Up for Ubuntu Development\n\n*How to Fix Bugs\nTutorials\nWe run events throughout the cycle to help people just like you, specifically we run Ubuntu Developer Week in IRC, which is a live tutorial and Question and Answer workshop. There's one coming up at the end of February if you want to join in!\nHere are two logs from a past session to give you an idea:\n\n*\n\n*Getting Started in Ubuntu Development I\n\n*Getting Started in Ubuntu Development II\nPlaces to Find Opportunities\n\n*\n\n*Harvest - this tool goes through all the patches and packages in Launchpad (and even looks in other distros) for patches. Many of these can be snagged, applied, tested, and then fixed in Ubuntu and then sent upstream.\n\n*Cleansweep - List of patches sitting in Launchpad that someone has attached to a bug report. These could be useful or not, they still should  be looked at though.\n\nGetting Help\nContacting the MOTU on the mailing list or IRC is a good way to get help for individual problems you run into:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Contact\nFeedback\nWe've spent a lot of time reworking this documentation to be as easy as we can, if you would take notes on your experiences and how we can improve this stuff it would be very useful to know how to make it suck less for people like you.\n\nA: Jorge's generalized answer is a great introduction to jumping into Ubuntu development, but let's try to look a little closer at you specific issue...\nApport's main upstream developer and Ubuntu maintainer are one and the same. This simplifies things for you a bit. Instead of having to learn about packaging and patch systems, the easiest path here is to work directly on the upstream code.\nApport's development is hosted on Launchpad. It uses the bazaar distributed version control system to manage its source code. The first step towards fixing your bug is to grab the source. If you haven't used bazaar before, the bazaar in five minutes tutorial is a good place to start.\nInstall bazaar with:\nsudo apt-get install bzr\n\nPull apport's source code:\nbzr branch lp:apport\n\nNow you can get started hacking. As with most VCSs, when working with bazaar, it is a good idea to only make one change per commit. You should also make your commit messages informative. It makes your changes much easier to review. When you are ready to make your first commit, run:\nbzr commit -m \"My commit message.

Where is my purchased music? On my Maverick laptop I have synced some folders like Pictures and Documents. Also I have some purchased Music.\nWith Natty Narwhal Ubuntu One just syncs the Ubuntu One folder. What's wrong?\n\nA: As of Natty subscription to synchronized folders is no longer automatic. You will be prompted as to which ones you want to synced on signing in to an existing account, and if and when you add additional synchronized folders. However not all of that work is done in Natty right now, so until then, go to System > Preferences > Ubuntu One, go to the “Cloud folders” tab, and select which ones you want synchronized.\n\n", "Q: Square in calendar on random day I'm running Unity on Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition here.\nIn this screenshot, there is this small orange square on the calendar which I presume is supposed to mark the present day of month.\n\nStill, it seems to highlight a random date, which can be set by any user.\nIt is worse: even if I set it to the current day of month, it doesn't get updated when the clock hits 12AM.\nSo, I would like it to highlight the current day, update itself automatically, and keep normal users from changing it.\nIs it possible ?\nThanks a lot!!\n\nA: You're running into this bug.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I subscribe to a bug?\n", "Q: Are Ratings & Reviews going to be in Maverick?

There are two possible ways to remap the command key with that setup (choose only one):\n\n\n*\n\n*VMWare Fusion for Mac has an option in Preferences > Keyboard and Mouse to choose which key combination to map the command key to (it's mapped to the windows key by default).  If you do it this way it applies to all of your virtual machines.\n\n*You can remap the Windows key in Ubuntu (which is what the command key does by default in VMWare Fusion).  Open Keyboard Preferences, then go to Layouts > Options > Alt/Win key behaviour.  Select \"Control is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)\".\nWhichever solution you choose, remember to disable VMWare's own keyboard shortcuts in VMWare preferences, otherwise VMWare's shortcuts will take precedence over the ones in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Drive reporting incorrect free space So I swapped my shiny SATA SSD for an even shinier PCI-E SSD. I run my core OS on the SSD because it's silly-fast. I did this on my old SSD so I created a new EXT4 partition and then just dded the data across (sorry I don't know the exact command I ran anymore) and after reinstalling grub, I booted onto the PCI-E SSD. At first glance everything had worked perfectly and things were running faster than ever.\nBut then I noticed the free disk space on the new, larger drive: it was almost exactly the same as it was on the other disk... A disk that was half its size.\nSo it looks as if I've copied the files across incorrectly and it's copied some of the filesystem metadata along with it.\nTools like du and Disk Usage Analyzer come back with the correct figures. Things that look at the partition (and not the files) seem to think the drive is 120GB\nI've been using this drive for a week now so it's way out of sync with the old SSD so dumping the data and starting again isn't a job that fills me with joy but two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to fix my filesystem so it knows what it's really on about? fsck e2fsck and badblocks all seem to be able to scan it without finding a problem with it.\n\n*If I do plug my old SSD back in, copy the data off my PCI-E on to it and then copy it back onto a fresh filesystem (eg juggle the data around), what's the best way of doing that? I obviously want to keep all the permissions and softlinks where they are.\n\nA: The tool you used dd isn't a file copy tool, it's a disk copy tool and it copies byte for byte. This means that every piece of information, including meta data about the amount of space in the partition on the drive, has been copied.\nYou need to do a full backup of your files, format the drive (including a full parition format) create a new ext4 root parition and swap drive and then copy the files over.\nOnce you've copied the files, you need to chroot over to the new system and run the update-grub command to install the boot system on the new drive.\nOr you could just run a new install of Ubuntu and put your files back.\n\nWhat Oli did to fix this\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted to a LiveCD and selected \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Mounted my SSD and also another disk (to copy to)\n\n*Ran\nsudo rsync -ax /media/ssd /media/backup-drive/ssd-backup\n\nThis takes a long time. I did some cleaning up before copying but still had 35GB and while I was getting write bursts of ~120MB/s, it took a while. rsync won't give you output by default but you can add --progress if you want a perverse amount of detail (although it moved too fast for me to really read it -- and probably just slowed things down).\n\n*I tried to nuke the drive but was getting \"device busy\" issues from palimpsest (Disk Utility) so I ran the installer! In the installer I just told it to create a nice filesystem using the whole SSD drive and then ran killall ubiquity after it had started copying files.\n\n*Then I nuked all the files that the installer had copied in, then I copied back the backup files:\nsudo rm -rf /media/ssd/*\nsudo rsync -ax /media/backup-drive/ssd-backup /media/ssd\n\n\n*Then I rebooted and found my UUID had changed (obvious when you think about it) so grub2 had no idea where to boot from and blew up so I headed back into the LiveCD. If you're following this as a guide, I suggest you skip this step ;)\n\n*Reinstall grub! I followed the help docs and followed the chroot option. You might find you need to edit your /etc/fstab while you're in there.\n\n*Reboot and you should be done. I'm back, I've got a metric \"oodle\" of free space. Huzzah.\n\n\nA: Actually it is OK to dd the whole disk into another one. But then you need to resize the partitions to fill the new, bigger disk. You can use the awesome gparted disk partitioning tool to do this. They have their own LiveCD, too.\n\nA: I assume you are doing something like:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda98 of=/dev/sda99\n\nwhere /dev/sda98 has a size of 12GB and /dev/sda99 is 25GB in size.\nObviously these names are wrong, but you get the idea.\nWhat you have done is to move not just the data but the entire file system, including all of its metadata describing what's free and what's used, to the new partition. It has lot's of free space but that free space hasn't been incorporated into the file system on /dev/sda99 so its hidden at the end of the partition and completely unusable.\nThe solution is to resize the file system located in the partition:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda99\n\nit works on EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4 file systems.\nYou should make a backup first.\nThis will tell the file system to expand into all available space on the partition, incorporating the new space into the file systems's metadata so files can be stored in it.\nYou can't copy a bigger partition to a smaller partition with dd unless you tell it to only copy so much with the count parameter. dd does a bit for bit copy of everything in the source partition to the target partition, in this case it tries to copy all of the hidden/invisible space to the smaller partition along with the original contents. It has no idea or care about what it is copying--it needn't be a valid file system at all.\n\nA: I had this problem when resizing a Linux EX2 partition using Paragon Partition Manager in Windows.  Fortunately I had two EX2 Linux partitions, each with Linux distributions on them.  I was able to boot into the Linux partition that had not been resized, and then used Gparted to shrink and then expand again the partition that had not properly allocated the free space to the filesystem.  This worked perfectly!\n", "Q: How to convert VCD to DVD? I have lots of VCDs which I want to convert to DVDs. Can you suggest me a software with GUI which would do it for me?\nThanks.\n\nA: I suggest qdvdauthor or dvdrip as gui based. But i HIGHLY suggest using console tools like ffmpeg, mencoder and similars. They do a fast, excellent job.\nYou can also MAKE an iso of a vcd with acetoneiso, brasero (Which comes by default in Ubuntu) or k3b (Which comes by default in Kubuntu) and then burn it like dvd with something like devede.\nRemember that you can not make a video with higher quality than what it has in the beginning. In your case you cant make a vcd quality movie have a dvd quality. It is like a dvd quaility trying to have a blue-ray quality.\nAll the tools i suggested can be found in the ubuntu software center or synaptic.\nIf you are going to use all the tools for that then you should first make the vcd to iso and then test it by viewing it with vlc. If all is good then burn it with devede which will make it into dvd format (With an optional menu) and you can just burn it and watch it in your media player.\nUs the following in console to have them all installed:\nsudo apt-get install vlc devede acetoneiso ubuntu-restricted-extras mencoder ffmpeg\nThis should have you ready to transform anything to dvd.\nRemember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the ISO from the source. In your case a VCD. You can use acetoneiso or brasero for it.\n\n*OPEN the iso with VLC to watch it and see how it all came out. If good then open with DEVEDE\n\n", "Q: How to reach a host in the same network by hostname? I have a network which connects a couple of hosts.\nI would like to be able to reach other hosts from one of them using the hostname.\nI just discovered the \".local\" domain, which is available through avahi and /etc/nsswitch.conf.\nBut it's not set up this way on my servers.\nAnd I don't want to create an entry in my dns server.\nIs there an other way to do so ?\n\nA: An alternative is to add an entry in your /etc/hosts file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/hosts\n\nAn entry takes the form 123.123.123.123 host.domain or just 123.123.123.123 host.\nIf you do that, you can now for example ssh host and it will connect to 123.123.123.123\n\nA: Your /etc/nsswitch.conf should already have this for mDNS (avahi):\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n\nJust install avahi-daemon on the machines you want talking to eachother, and you should be set to use HOSTNAME.local like this:\nssh yourmachine.local\n\n\nA: I found another solution.\nUsing the file, /etc/dhccp3/dhcient.conf\nThere is a line starting like this, send host-name\nThis could be modified to\nsend host-name 'server1'\nThis solution look nice, but i don't know if the every machine which use the same dns will see my \"server1\" hostname.\nAnother bad side to this solution, i need to specify the hostname here and in the /etc/hosts\nI just know that this file (/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf) is not a script, so i can't use a environnement variable to fill this line correctly.\n\nA: You can let dynamic DHCP add the entry in DNS, instead of yourself.\n\nA: if using avahi-daemon, you may need to copy ssh.services into /etc/avahi/services. On mine,\nsudo cp /usr/share/doc/avahi-daemon/examples/ssh.service /etc/avahi/services/\n", "Q: How to compute PID cpu load? Please help me to find a reliable way to compute (in a bash script) a jboss PID cpu load. \nTo be specific, I don't know how to aggregate /proc/[pid]/stat fields to obtain the load a specific process makes on a multiple cpu 64 bit env. Ubuntu.\nThanks a lot,\nXander\n\nA: The tool that interprets the /proc/[pid]/stat information is ps, this tools allows you to get the cpu load of any single process on the system:\nps S -p [pid] -o pcpu=\n\nTo monitor using this command, you can use watch: \nwatch ps S -p [pid] -o pcpu=\n\nThis command outputs a percentage of total cpu use of the agregate of all child processes.

Then they stopped being intermittent, and I always had these boring gray windows. I tried finding a workaround uninstalling the nvidia drivers and downloading newer ones from Nvidias site.\nI uninstalled them but couldn't shut down the xserver to command line. If I did /etc/init.d/gdm stop the system just hanged. I tried booting into recovery mode, but after a whole bunch of startup output my screen goes to sleep (eg no output).\nLastly this has escalated so now I don't get any image when I boot into a normal Ubuntu session\n\nA: You don't say if you are using the latest nvidia Drivers, which would be useful in order to give you an answer. But assuming that you have the latest nVidia Drivers installed, try setting up your nVidia Settings by dropping the next in a terminal:\nsudo nvidia-settings\n\nAfter entering your password the nVidia X Server Settings window will appear, and after adjusting the parameters that make your screen look as you wish, click on the \"X Server Display Configuration\" in the left pane, then just save your changes by clicking the \"Save to X Configuration File\" button.\nAfter that, a soft reboot of the X will be enough but if you reboot your machine will also do the trick. In order to soft-restart the X, press the [Ctrl][Alt][F1] in order to go to the console (text only) mode and drop the next command:\nkillall5\n\nPlease make sure you save all your open documents prior to do this because of the system is going to close down your session without allowing you to save anything.\nLog in again and see the changes. If your configuration remains, it's time for a hardware reboot. Do it and check.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: either that you can drop the single nvidia-settings command in the terminal, it won't allow you to save the changes. Do it as suggested and let's see what happen.\nJust a question: which window's decoration manager are you using? your problem sounds more like a problem with Emerald or something. Sorry if my answer isn't what you expected.\n", "Q: Technical differences between ways in which UNIX and Windows \"mount\" devices Question from which this arose is here: What does it mean to mount something?\nSince asking about which is \"better\" or which \"worse\" can lead to subjective and argumentative answers, I'd like to know about the technical differences between the two.\n\nA: Basic technical differences between Unix mounting (single tree) and Windows drive letters (multi forested):\n\n\n*\n\n*The Unix root file system allows for other file system to be placed inside it, giving it a branched structure from a single point.\n\n*The Windows drives allow for multiple root file systems, but don't allow any other file system inside.\n\n*Each Unix mount point has group/owner/all permissions for reading, writing and access.\n\n*Unix mount points can be removed and added through commands, including reading to custom locations for testing and fixing.\n\n*Windows drives have a natural list of available partitions/drives which is easily visible from the desktop and reflected directly in the file system structure.\n\n*There is a fixed limit to the number of drive letters available in windows, there s no such limit to unix mounting.\n\n*Network mounting is transparent and files from the network are placed in a location specific for the client machine.\n\n*Unix mounting allows for fusefs which provides interesting access to data. Generative folders which are not possible unless you have unix like mounting.\n\n*In unix A drive can be mounted into a specific location according to the booting operating system. In one os on the same machine a partition may be mounted to /media/backup and in another os it might be mounted to /home/\n\n*Any part of your operating system's files can be put onto their own mount. Either a different partition, disk or even network or cloud storage mounts. This enables thin clients to load their operating system from the network (nfs).\n\n*The chroot process allows you to change the root in a unix file system an effectively swap out the running system for a new one, without restarting. This is impossible with drive letters as they're all pre-assigned.\n\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list and may need to be cleaned up in the future.\n\nA: mount is just terminology. It has long roots and it ended up staying until today. Other obscure terms are patch (software patch, that changes the main software in a small way so as to fix a problem) which comes from the clothing industry. Or bug, a generic software defect, that comes from an actual bug that short-circuited the circuits of the first ever computers. Or daemon to describe a system service.\nWhen the original software was developed there was no market as we have today, so the codewords that the programmers chose ended up reaching the end-users. \nCurrently there is a process to remove these awkward words with more neutral and descriptive terms. For example, instead of daemon, we have service.\nDesktop environments such as GNOME are in the process of removing these obscure terms.\nUpdate: And to answer your question, all operating systems perform this task. It's just you got exposed to mount which might have confused you.\n", "Q: Tweak Conky Layout via a script I'm using a script in Conky in order to display my new gmail on my desktop.\nIt works beautifully, but is kind of ugly, and I'm not sure how to fix it.\nWhat I've currently got looks like this:\n\nAnd what I'd like is this:\n \nAny ideas for how to make that happen are much appreciated.

However, when I try this I get the following error upon boot:\nnfsmount: bad option 'fsc'\n\nWhy doesn't nfsmount permit this option? (It works fine when you mount manually with mount -o fsc after booting up.)\nI changed nfsmount to mount -t nfs in the file /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/nfs and then I ran update-initramfs -u to update the initramfs image, but it seems this still gives an error: \nmount: unknown nfs mount option 'fsc'\n\nMy guess would be that this is a limitation of the mount functionality in klibc. What would be the best way to address this? Does the nfsmount program need to be patched?\nSince this seems to be a limitation of the nfsmount tool in klibc, I was thinking that I could add /sbin/mount.nfs to the initramfs image and mount the nfsroot with this tool instead. I copied it into the folder /usr/lib/klibc/bin and I updated the script /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/nfs as follows:\nmount.nfs ${NFSROOT} ${rootmnt} -o nolock ${roflag} ${NFSOPTS}\n\nAfter booting the updated initramfs image, there is a long delay when mount.nfs is executed and then the following message is displayed:\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified  \nBegin: Retrying nfs mount ... Begin: Running /scripts/nfs-premount ... done.\n\nHowever, this message is displayed no matter what mount options I use, so it appears to be a different problem altogether...\n\nA: I finally manged to solve it. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add mount.nfs from Ubuntu 10.04 to the initramfs image (copy it into the /usr/lib/klibc/bin folder.)\n\n*Change the nfsmount line in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/nfs to:\nmount.nfs ${NFSROOT} ${rootmnt} -o nolock ${roflag} ${NFSOPTS}\n\n\n*Update the initramfs image with either mkinitramfs or update-initramfs.\nThis would enable the fsc option on the nfsroot for my Ubuntu 10.10 system. I have no idea why I'm not able to use mount.nfs from 10.10 though -- perhaps a regression?\n\nA: Recently I was building a new nfsroot based on 16.04 and decided to take another look at using cachefilesd for the nfsroot file system.  Yet again I stumbled on this post.  It helped to get me pointed in the right direction, and I ended up getting it to work but I believe I have a better answer than the one posted here.  \nWhile meanderix's steps could work I don't think its the best way.  So here are my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks create a new file.  I called mine fsc for file system cache.\n\n*Add the following content to your file:\n#!/bin/sh \nset -e\nPREREQ=\"\"\nprereqs () {\n        echo \"${PREREQ}\"\n}  \ncase \"${1}\" in\n        prereqs)\n                prereqs\n                exit 0\n                ;;\nesac\n. /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions\ncopy_exec /sbin/mount.nfs /sbin\nexit 0\n\n\n*Make the fsc file executable: \nchmod 755 /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/fsc\n\n\n*Modify /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/nfs as meanderix suggests.\n\n*Generate your initramfs. eg:\nmkinitramfs -o /fscinitrd\n\nThe difference and the real magic here is the /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/fsc file.  Particularly the copy_exec line.  When the initial RAM disk is created it will automatically add mount.nfs to the initramfs.  But wait there's more!  It will also determine the libraries needed and add them for you too.  That's really cool since on Ubuntu 16.04 I needed libtirpc.so since mount.nfs was dependent on it and this added those dependencies for me.  \nAfter doing this and configuring cachefilesd I now have file system caching for my NFSROOT and that's just awesome.\n\nA: The kernel has not been compiled with that module (CONFIG_NFS_FSCACHE in kernel config).\nAnd a link to a guide for that: Ubuntu Kernel/Compile\n", "Q: How to remove a package from the list of packages to be installed in apt-get?

In Totem the youtube plugin first loads all the video, taking a lot of time for a video of 5 minutes. Only when all the video is loaded it starts playing it.\nIs this normal?\n\nA: I don't use Totem with that plugin, but I don't think that is normal, because I develop an extension for Firefox, called FlashVideoReplacer, that loads YouTube videos with other plugins or standalone players and it doesn't require the video to be fully loaded before playing it.

When I try it with Nautilus, first I have to open the correct directory, copy the file, go to the other directory and paste it there. I was thinking of a better way and old KDE3 versions of Konqueror came to mind. It was possible to right-click on a file. The context menu had an option for copying, moving the file to some default directories. Furthermore you could select any directory under /. So for the above action one would right click on a file, select /opt first, a list of subdirectories will open, select /opt/quuz and so on.\nUsing GNOME there are only two possible values (home and desktop).

See: http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/installation-of-ubuntu-10-04/\nIt can be fixed by modifying the GRUB2 menu to point the Windows' entries to the correct disk partitions.

I happen to install model sim VHDL simulator on Linux. The manual says it only supports RedHat or Suse, but I just tried to install it on Ubuntu. And, I could install it without any problem.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is linux binary universal to all kinds of distribution? I mean, if I make a program on distrubution A, can I be sure it will run on any linux?\n\n*Why most of the commercial program vendor says the program is running on specific distribution? (mostly Redhat and Suse, not ubuntu)\n\n\nA: Both RedHat and SUSE have long enterprise Linux tradition and managed to get those packages produced and tested for them. As time passes, there will be more examples of packages that have been tested to work on Ubuntu. In fact, many such packages since last year come as tested to work with Ubuntu. As Canonical makes agreements with more vendors, there will be more Ubuntu-certified packages.\nFor your first question: If you want to make a program that runs on all distributions, create a static (compared to dynamic) executable. A statically-linked executable does not depend on the system libraries, therefore can work between distributions, as long as the architecture (such as Intel/AMD) is the same.\nHere is a program,\nint main(void)\n{ \n  printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nLet's compile as normal,\n$ gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld\n$ ./helloworld\nHello, World!\n$ ldd helloworld\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3cc3481000)\n...\n$ \n$ gcc helloworld.c -static -o helloworld_static\n$ ./helloworld\nHello, World!\n$ ldd helloworld_static\n    not a dynamic executable\n$ \n\nSo, what can you do with that VHDL program? Get the .rpm file and convert it to .deb using alien. Then, install. If it worked, you are ok. If it does not work, use ldd to figure out which library file is missing. On the worst case scenario, create a virtual machine for those other Linux distributions and run the program there.\n\nA: This is two questions:\nIs a Linux binary universal to all distributions?\nIt depends: \n\n\n*\n\n*If the program is using nothing outside the Linux kernel, it will be universal except for the 32- or 64-bit question. A Linux \"hello world\" (a minimalistic program that just prints \"hello world\" to a terminal window) could probably be independent of the distribution.\n\n*If the program is using any non-kernel library or service (which is most of Linux, the kernel is fairly small), there are differences in which libraries are included, which versions these libraries are and where they are located. So in this (most common) case distributions are not equal.\n\n\nWhy do many commercial programs say that they only work on one or a few distributions?\nBecause there is a very large number of Linux distributions, and nobody wants to test their program on all of them. \nA commercial vendor will normally say that they support only the distributions they have tested their software on. It may or may not work on other distributions, from the vendor's perspective the point is just that you can't complain if it does not work on a distribution they don't support.\nWhich distributions are selected for testing depends on what the vendor expects their customers to be using. Commercial/professional programs commonly pick enterprise distributions, possibly through a reasoning similar to \"people who paid for their OS are more likely to pay for our software\", possibly simply by counting the distributions used by their existing customers.\nSee also Mark Shuttleworth (the guy that is the reason we have an Ubuntu in the first place) on binary compatibility between Ubuntu and Debian - Debian is the closest distribution relative of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I second j-g-faustus' reply, but, you also need to be careful about the package format.  Even if the executables themselves are portable and all necessary libraries are present, different distros put files in different places and use different tools to manage installed packages.If the vendor packages their product as an RPM package, you will have to use a package like 'alien' to convert and install it under a DEB based distribution like Ubuntu.  \nIf they distribute their software as source code, then you may also be able to compile it yourself, at which point the executable will be tailored for your specific system (but the ubuntu package manager won't know about it). \n", "Q: I switched to a Debian desktop, how can I download my notes from Ubuntu One acct?

But I do not get how, I hope anyone can help.\n\nA: I think the source of the confusion is how Grub works. Grub typically attaches itself to the MBR of your hard disk, and it is the hard disk that you have setup in the BIOS to boot first. In addition, you can select that hard disk with F12 as you already have done.\nIn the MBR there is the starting point for Grub, which then points to a Linux partition that contains the rest of the Grub code. The Grub code resides in the /boot directory.\nSo what I can guess is that you installed Grub on the MBR second (160GB) hard disk, therefore Grub can only activate when you select to boot from the second hard disk in the BIOS. This might be fine for Ubuntu, but probably messes up with the Windows booting because of drive number changes.\nWhat I recommend is to put Grub/MBR on the first hard disk so that Grub takes over the booting of your computer. Then, you need to make sure that /boot is always accessible. Either the second hard disk is always there, or you can be a pro and create a separate /boot partition (about 500MB) and place it on the first/primary hard disk. \nIf you do not want to let Grub take over the computer, you can keep the Windows boot manager in charge (but you lose fancy boot options).

This is something that's been bothering me, and I would like to know if it's an issue that's known. OK, I have monitored the HDD temperature, for a couple of days, when running in Ubuntu and Windows 7. I have both OS installed on the same laptop, and I'm using Speedfan to monitor the hdd temp in Windows 7, and hddtemp to monitor on Ubuntu.\nWhen running on Windows 7 the HDD usually stay around 37-39. This is on the load of when just web browsing, watch movies, and programming. And when I do the same thing on Ubuntu the HDD will go to 40-42. Most of the time however it stay 41-42 degree. Btw, even when just idling in Ubuntu the HDD will go over 40 degrees.\nThis isn't a really big issue maybe since I read that HDD can handle temperature to at least 60 degree. However since the HDD is located just where I put my right palm, so it is quite disturbing at some times.\nIs this temperature the same for you guys which are running Ubuntu 10.10 on a laptop?\n\nA: The hard disk temperature depends on the ambient temperature, so it is not easily comparable.\nThere are other discussions on askubuntu.com that talk about powertop which is a tool to control the fine issues of power tuning. Have a look at it (search) to see if you can perform some optimisations for your laptop.\nThe reason why Ubuntu might be a little warmer for the hard disk is due to how often it needs to access the disk. There is a system option called laptop_mode, which you can set and see what temperature the disk reaches when idle. To do so,\n# Read the current value for laptop_mode\ncat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode\n# Set the laptop_mode to five, which reduces the accesses to the disk, letting it sleep more.\nsudo echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode\n\nWhen the system lets the hard disk to sleep for a little when idle, the hard disk goes in a lower power mode, and becomes cooler. However, this change of power mode has a small effect on the lifetime of the disk. You can use Disk Utility in the Administrative tools to find out how often the disk goes into and comes back from the low power state. \nRead more at\nTips to extend battery life for laptops and notebooks\n", "Q: Why is ssh-add adding duplicate identity keys? I have created a private/public SSH key pair using ssh-keygen. I use this to authenticate to remote servers. However, I find that when I log in, ssh-add -l already lists my identity key even though I have not added it! \nIf I use the command ssh-add it prompts me for my passphrase and loads my identity key. If I then list my keys with ssh-add -l, it now shows two identity keys! These are obviously the same as both have the same fingerprint, but their descriptions are different (the automatically loaded one is \"user@host (RSA)\" and the one added using ssh-add is \"/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)\").\nSo why does my identity key appear to be loaded without any action on my part, and why does ssh-add add the same key again? Obviously something must be doing this automatically, but what is it, and how can I stop it?\n\nA: Using ssh-keygen creates a key ~.ssh/id_rsa or ~.ssh/id_dsa. These are the default file locations for ssh keys and are read in automatically. Use ssh-add when you need to add extra keys.\nIf you don't want a default key simply name your keys something other than id_rsa. This can be done when generating ssh-keygen -f keyname or simply by renaming the file.\n\nA: Ubuntu keychain could be doing the initial load of your identity.\nMore likely, your ssh-agent itself is grabbing the identities it needs to make password-free ssh (and scp, rsync, sftp, etc) possible for the logged-in user. Ubuntu uses your desktop login credentials to allow the ssh-agent to load identities from any of the several default locations in ~/.ssh.\nJust like logging into a remote server, logging into your local desktop starts up the ssh-agent daemon.\nTry pgrep ssh-agent and kill it if you like to enter your passwords a lot. But requiring passwords all the time is less secure than trusting the agent -- remembering them, keeping them secure, shoulder surfers, keyloggers, webcam peeping, history files, typing them at the wrong prompt and revealing them to the wrong server/daemon, ... the list goes on.\n", "Q: Missing dependency when trying to install VirtualBox I wanted to install virtualbox-4.0 (or any other version)\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to System → Administration → Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*Then I marked virtualbox-4.0 for installation but i get this error:\nvirtualbox-4.0:\n  Depends: libqt4-opengl but it is not going to be installed\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If you do not mind installing the Ubuntu version of VirtualBox 3.2 instead of the latest 4.0, install virtualbox-ose (VirtualBox Open Source Edition) instead of virtualbox-4.0. virtualbox-4.0 isn't in the default repositories, you've possibly added a 3rd party repository which isn't compatible with the standard ones. If you cannot wait and really want the 4.0 version of VirtualBox, follow the instructions at http://www.webupd8.org/2010/12/install-virtualbox-40-stable-in-ubuntu.html.\nTo install the virtualbox-ose from Ubuntu, you need to remove virtualbox.org from your repositories. Run the next command to remove all lines containing \"virtualbox\":\nsudo sed '/virtualbox/d' -i /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAlternatively, remove the three \"virtualbox\" lines from your /etc/sources.list manually using a text-editor like gedit:\ngksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nRelated launchpad question: virtualbox-ose 4.0 needs packaging\n\nvirtualbox-ose in ubuntu 11.04 Natty and newer comes with version VirtualBox 4, no additional repositories are necessary.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Contacts Sync Error I have synced my contacts with Ubuntu One, however, an error occurred, and I have instead of 300 contacts over 1700 contacts and all are messed up.\nHow can I delete all contacts, and restart the sync process?

What can I do to make Ubuntu automatically mount an external drive when it is connected to an eSATA port?\nCurrently I must go to Home Folder ▸ Go ▸ Computer and click on the disk to mount it.\n\nA: Previously, when HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) was handling the hardware devices, you would follow the instructions found at http://vstone.eu/2009/04/hal-and-auto-mounting-external-e-sata-devices/\nHowever, current distributions use udev to handle hardware devices, which means that you have to do some work (I did not find instructions for udev and eSata).\nSo, what needs to be done is edit /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules and the section that says\n# Set eSATA port type for known eSATA CardBus adapters - first we want to ensure\n# the device is on a cardbus controller (upper PCI device) - then we check\n# vid/pid (lower PCI device)\n#\nSUBSYSTEM==\"scsi_host\", ATTRS{class}==\"0x060700\", GOTO=\"ata_port_cardbus\"\nGOTO=\"ata_port_cardbus_end\"\nLABEL=\"ata_port_cardbus\"\n# Mass storage controller: Silicon Image, Inc.

When you share a directory using samba, you can do this system-wide by editing the /etc/samba/smb.conf file (the advanced way) or by right-clicking a directory using Nautilus and selecting 'Sharing Options' (the easy way). However, while I can see what directories are shared system-wide by looking at /etc/samba/smb.conf, if I share directories using Nautilus, I do not know what directories that I (or other users) have shared.\nSo how do I list all the directories that have been shared by samba using Nautilus Sharing Options for all the users on a system?\n\nA: You are looking for /var/lib/samba/usershares/ which contains a directory full of different user's shares.\nSince one home folder can only ever be shared once, it makes sense to put them here in a central location. The directory is writeable by the sambashare group, so you need to be in that group in order to create a share.\nEach share is then owned by the user that created it.\n", "Q: No HDMI Audio with GeForce 9600GT and nForce board I've been trying to get HDMI with sound working for the last few days, and I'm a little bit out of ideas.

Remember that in the majority of the cases the audio hardware (mic and headphones) is good enough for almost anything but they can also have a failure. So you better check if your alsa mixer gives a response by doing this and check it out with some other hardware.\nIn my case I had to change from 2 different microphones to a proffessional Senheiser or Shure with an adapted 1/8\" stereo plug to a balanced canon line in order to have a good microphone source for the input.\n(AND I SAID: MY CASE, which means \"probably not your case\", so if you wish to downvote my comment please check that this answer won't probably fit your issue, but what I wish is to contribute my experiences, thank you.)\n", "Q: Error: package has no installation candidate I want to install nautilus-open-terminal on my 64 bit Lucid Lynx and I'm getting this:\nantonio@antonio-desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\nReading package lists...

Every respected dock out there (docky, awn, cairo dock) has these 2 important features that I really consider a must:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ability to re-size them (someone may like smaller or bigger icons than the default ones)\n\n*The ability to change their position (bottom, left, right)\nIn Unity (which let's face it, is a dock) I heard that it will not be possible even in the long run to have these features implemented. \nIn my opinion Ubuntu is reinventing the wheel here, because so far Unity doesn't offer a thing more than, for example docky (they are offering even less) and they are doing it the wrong way by not including some simple and very necessary options that I think everybody wants, that's why they are present in the other docks.\nIn Mac OS X, the Apple logo is in the left, the min, max, close buttons are on the left, but still you can resize and position your dock wherever you want. \nSo again, my question is: \nIs there any really plausible explanation why unity will not include these simple features? \n\nA: Question 1\nMark Shuttleworth answered a question on this topic on this very site:\n\nNo, the size and position of the Unity launcher are fixed. In future, they should respond to information we can discern on your preferred font sizes and screen size/resolution, but that's for a future date.\n\nIt's unclear whether it will at a point in the future be possible to change the size of the launcher manually.\nQuestion 2\nThis feature request was reported as a bug recently, but the request was declined.\nMark Shuttleworth answered:\n\nI'm afraid that won't work with our broader design goals, so we won't implement that. We want the launcher always close to the Ubuntu button.\n\nSee also: OMG Ubuntu - Ubuntu Unity launcher won’t be ‘moveable’\nSidenote\nThe Canonical Design Blog talks about why the Unity Launcher is not considered to be a Dock. One reason for this is the 'accordion' effect for large numbers of launchers - in a convential dock the launchers would just get smaller and smaller.\n", "Q: Sign out of Ubuntu single sign-on account in software center reviews Will the Ubuntu Software Center get an option to sign out of your Ubuntu single sign-on account?\n\nA: From what I'm reading in the Software Center Specifications, and from what I'm seeing as I'm exploring the Ubuntu Software Center on Natty (11.04), the answer is \"No\". \n", "Q: Application specific environment variable settings I'm trying to work around a known bug in Ubuntu 9.10, where using the scrollbar in emacs causes text to be highlighted, and the cursor to move.

Sometimes it may be needed that a user only has access to a certain application. Running the desktop environment then may be unwanted be it either for security reasons or for acchieving a better accessibility to the given application.\nIn these cases it may be desired to replace the desktop by an application that runs immediately after login.\nOther users should have a normal access to their desktops.\n\nA: Replacing Desktop By An Application\nDefine User Defined Session\nFirst we will have to define a User Defined Session that handles the special case when no desktop should be loaded. We will define this session by creating a custom.desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/ with a content similar to this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Custom\nComment=Custom Session to run ~./.xsession\nExec=/home/<username>/.xsession\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=<gnome-session-3.0>\n\nThis will tell GDM to run the script .xsession located in the HOME of the user <username>.\nOptional X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain is needed for a correct language translation in case we load Unity/GNOME desktop later (replace with gdm in 10.04).\nMake A Script To Start\nThis script ~/.xsession could look as simple as that:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nxterm\nlogout\n\nLoad Custom Session On Login\nIf we now define to load our session \"Custom\" during the given user's login at the gdm screen only the X-Terminal will be started and we will be back at gdm on exit. Next time we login as the user this setting will be remembered as default.\nRun Application That Need Windows-Managing\nOf course we are not yet able to run an application that needs a windows manager such as GNOME. To do this replace the .xsession script by something like:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ngnome-wm &\nfirefox\nlogout\n\nWe can see that the GNOME windows manager is now loaded but no desktop elements are present. This enables an application (e.g. firefox here) to start. \nBut take care what you do: If we minimize the application to the non-existent tray we will end up with a nice wallpaper to look at. Because of this it is very important to include logout at the end of the script to logout the session after the application terminated. There really is no other programm running to do this for you until you add one to your script. You deliberately replaced your desktop by firefox only (a bad idea).\nOf course we would also be able to start gnome-desktop or gnome-session (resp. options) from the script but this is what we already do by default.\n", "Q: How do you administer CUPS remotely using the web interface?

First, use System > Preferences > Mouse.\n\nSecond, install gpointing-device-settings so you can use System > Preferences > Pointing device. The advantage here is that you should be able to set different speeds for your different mice and touchpads.\n\n\nA: I'd say that this is because of the drivers for the mouse and the touchpad.

Let me add some context: I am currently using Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit (Desktop) on a relatively powerful stationary PC (Intel Core i7 920, 12GB ram). My purpose is highspeed imaging with a pointgrey Grashopper machine-vision camera (for research, PhD project). This camera is capable of 200 fps at full VGA (640x480) resolution. The camera is connected using Firewire (1394b) and the drivers and software from Pointgrey works great. I have developed a console C++ application that can grap a certain number of frames to preallocated memory and after this also save the grapped frames to harddrive. Currently it works fine but sometimes I am observing a few framedrops (1-3). When this happens I reset the experiment and repeat the recording and usually i am lucky the second time with no framedrops (the camera-driver has a internal framecounter that I am using).\nQuestion: I usually go to tty1 and use \"sudo service gdm stop\" to disable the graphical frontend. It seems to release some memory though that is not my main concern. My concern is CPU resources. Are there other system hungry modules that can be disabled temporarily such that the CPU gets less busy on Ubuntu 9.10?\nAt some point in the future I will update to 10.10. Should I perhaps option for the server edition instead?\nThanks.\n\nA: Depending on how long the experiment is you could temporarily hold back the other processes with cpulimit. You might have to experiment a bit to find out who the big users are before putting the brakes on them. The good thing is that once you have finished you can stop cpulimit and everything will be back to normal. One thing to mention you will have to do a bit of math as you have a quad core to take into account the %per core not difficult but it will make a difference to the result. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Software and scanner for scanning photographic slides? I am searching for software and hardware for scanning slides to import to digitize my old pictures..\nI have already a scanner working in Windows, but I would like to scan them directly in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10\n\n*Scanner: :ZOLID\n\n*lsusb output: OmniVision Technologies, Inc.

It's available for Linux, Windows, and Mac and supports MANY scanners with it's own drivers. Try the trial version to see if it works with your scanner (it puts watermarks on the scans, but at least you can see if it'll work for you).\nNot Free (in either sense), but a substantially better value and better service than you get from most paid-for software. \n\nA: I have just received a similar (branded OTEK Filmscanner FS500-2) scanner and also had trouble getting it to work (Windows 8 had no support for it but no surprises there).

Is it possible to reload the kernel using kexec after a kernel upgrade without doing a complete reboot?\nThe Ubuntu wiki RapidReboot page explains how to perform that using init.d commads, any fast way (i.e. a script) for doing that only on explicit request?\n\nA: That method IS the fast way that does it on explicit request.  First you load the new kernel with kexec, and then you reboot and the modified script launches the new kernel instead of actually rebooting.

This has been problematic for me in Ubuntu since I live in the UK but want the week to start on a Sunday (because that is the system my work use).

I find it baffling that an operating system doesn't have such a simple option that even my phones always seem to have had.\n\nA: You are looking for a locale override for the start of week feature of your locale.\nAs you mention, Evolution provides such an override. \nThe gtk+ library no longer provides a way to override the locale information for the start of the week, http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/2.21/GtkCalendar.html#GtkCalendarDisplayOptions\nGTK_CALENDAR_WEEK_START_MONDAY\n    Since GTK+ 2.4, this option is deprecated and ignored by GTK+. \n    The information on which day the calendar week starts is derived \n    from the locale. \n\nAdapting your current locale is not a difficult task, and you may have to go through this venue to solve the problem. That is, either change your locale to, let's say, en_US (start of week is Sunday) or modify your existing locale.\nTo modify your locale\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_GB\n\nand change the values for first_weekday and first_workday.

Is there a solution?\n\nA: By default the first user's account is an administrative account, so if the UI is prompting you for a password it's probably that person's user password. If the  user doesn't remember their password you need to reset it. To do this you need to boot into recovery mode (see also offical docs: RecoveryMode).\nBoot up the machine, and after the BIOS screen, hold down the left Shift key (note that for UEFI BIOS you might need press ESC instead). You will then be prompted by a menu that looks something like this: \n\nI've noticed on some systems that timing when to hit the left Shift key can be tricky, sometimes I miss it and need to try it again.\nHit the down arrow until you select the 2nd entry from the top (the one with the recovery mode in the description) and then hit Enter.\nNow you should see this menu:\n\nUsing the arrow keys scroll down to root and then hit Enter.\nYou should now see a root prompt, something like this:\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nAt this stage you should have a read-only filesystem. You have to remount it with write permissions:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nNow we can set the user's password with the passwd command. (In this example I will use jorge as the example, you need to substitute whatever the user's username is):\nroot@ubuntu:~# passwd jorge\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nType in what you want the new password to be at the prompt. After it's successful reboot the machine and the user will be able to log in with their new password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Recovery Mode documentation\n\n*Lost password documentation\n\n\n\nThere is concern about this being a security vulnerability. It is not. You need to have physical access to the machine to do this. If someone has physical access to your PC, they could do far worse than change a password. When it comes to physical access, the battle for security is lost. Be wary of who you let on your PC.\nEven setting a root password will not be successful, as one can simply boot with init being /bin/sh and have full root access. Again, given physical access, anyone with computer knowledge can do ANYTHING to your computer.\n\nA: I was having the same problem with my password and I tried everyone's suggestions but none worked for me. So I tried some of my own and this is what worked for me... \"Keep in mind I can NOT explain why it worked, all I know is it worked...\n\"10 Easy and Simple steps to Reset Lost or Forgotten Password\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot computer and hold the Left Shift Key down.\n\n*Select boot into recovery mode. \n\n\n*After a few seconds you should get the \"Recovery Mode Options\" screen.\n\nNote: (Here is the part I can't explain. After trying everything, and nothing working, I finally just started trying all the options here one at a time. When I tried the \"grub Update grub boot loader\" and then followed the rest of the steps all was well and password was reset.)\nSo before going to the \"root Drop to root shell promt\"selection,\n\n*Select \"grub Update grub boot loader\", and you should get this screen.\n\n\n*Select \"Yes\". Wait for it to go through the update.\n\n*Now select \"root Drop to root shell prompt\".\n\n*Now you should be at a root terminal with something like the following: youracctname@yourcompname:~$. type passwd accountname ( acountname  being the name of the account you are trying to change the password for ).\n\n*Enter new Unix password: \"enter the new password\".\n\n*Retype new Unix password: \"retype the same password you did in Step-8\".\n\n*It should confirm successful password change. type exit at the prompt and reboot.\nIf this does not work for you, try skipping Steps 4 & 5...\n\nA: Yes, you can change the old password via GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a single-boot (Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer), to get the boot menu to show, you have to hold down the Shift key during bootup.\n\n*If you have a dual-boot (Ubuntu is installed next to Windows, another Linux operating system, or Mac OS X; and you choose at boot time which operating system to boot into), the boot menu should appear without the need to hold down the shift key.\n\n*From the boot menu, select recovery mode, which is usually the second boot option.\n\n*After you select recovery mode and wait for all the boot-up processes to finish, you'll be presented with a few options. In this case, you want the Drop to root shell prompt option so press the ᛎ Down arrow to get to that option, and then press Enter to select it.\n\n*Once you're at the root shell prompt, if you have forgotten your username as well, type ls /home (small letters & not capitals). This will list all the user accounts in your set up.\n\n*To reset the password, type passwd username where username is the username you want to reset, for example, passwd mysterio in my case.\n\n*You'll then be prompted for a new password. When you type the password you will get no visual response acknowledging your typing. Your password is still being accepted. Just type the password and hit Enter when you're done. You'll be prompted to retype the password. Do so and hit Enter again.\n\n*Now the password should be reset. Type exit to return to the recovery menu.\n\n*After you get back to the recovery menu, select resume normal boot, and use Ubuntu as you normally would — only this time, you actually know the password!\n\nA: If you forgot the password for your Ubuntu system you can recover\nusing the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Turn your computer on.\n\n\n*Press ESC at the GRUB prompt.\n\n\n*Press e for edit.\n\n\n*Highlight the line that begins kernel ......... or linux ........, press e\n\n\n*Go to the very end of the line and add rw init=/bin/bash\n\n\n*Press Enter, then press b to boot your system.\nYour system will boot up to a passwordless root shell.1\n\n\n*Now issue the command passwd username\n*where \"username\" is the user for which you want to change the password.\n\n\n*Then you will be asked to give new password:\nEnter new UNIX password:\n1Source: ubuntugeek\nOther resources:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Documentation\n\n\n*Ubuntu Help\n\n\n*Psychocats\nFor Xubuntu 14.04 just follow the screens below. It's similar to some of the other answers.\nPress Esc, and choose Advanced options\n\nChoose recovery mode:\n\nThen choose root, and once you get the prompt type passwd <user_name>, to change the password.\n\n\nA: You can change your password if you have access to the file /etc/shadow (maybe with your root account, via sudo from another account, from recovery mode, or with a LiveCD/DVD). \nThis shadow password file has all the users and encrypted passwords (as well as other administrative information) for the system.  The fields are separated by : .  For example :\nYOUR_USERNAME:$6$lCu1.iVo$Q3nAL98jBLe5mMJ.0dBDd1Iquz41dDKsP3UdJ4X92gZPwwmQ0vdIEIY8EQxEcYACoMboYhovrpyq7Tm.DztQB.:15520:0:99999:7:::\nThe password is the second group of characters after YOUR_USERNAME, between the two colons.  You can replace this with a other password, for example, you could replace the existing password string (truncated for clarity): \n$6$lCu1.iVo$Q3nAL98jBLe5mMJ.0[...]boYhovrpyq7Tm.DztQB.\n\nwith    \n$6$8gMLdPVn$Ych6r5ysKRqhL9jOlg0UPe28KRuzo3TSYMShqb5pzACrE/A0oyDEBFefOgplbboeoe0T9ZqNz7u6Y8YWuQRkz/\nThe encrypted string represents \"hackme\".  This would be your new password.\n\nA: If Jorge's method didn't work for you, as it didn't for me, here is another method. I had to try something different because:\n\n*\n\n*My USB keyboard did not work at the root prompt ⋯ probably hardware either keyboard or mainboard. To fix I used an old PS/2 keyboard (the little round plug) and use that.\n\n\n*When I used passwd username to change my password, it failed because of a bad token or such. This called for drastic measures.\nThe Drastic Measures\nThis is a very dangerous thing to do! Jorge's method should be used; only do this in case that method doesn't work.\nDo this at your own risk. It did work for me on my 11.10 system.\nThe idea is to set the user's password to blank (or null) - this allows you to just press Enter at the Password: prompt.\nStill at the root prompt from Jorge's method, first remount the root file system as read-write by using this command:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you are a super-user on this system. Tread lightly.\nThen edit the password shadow file to remove the encrypted password for your username. Type in:\nnano -B /etc/shadow\n\nThe nano editor will display the contents of the file. Each line will have the form name:⋯:⋯:⋯… where ⋯ is a string or null (empty). One of the lines will start with your username. The first ⋯ after your username is your encrypted password. As an example:\nusername:$1$amFeNcjp$PprjCKEVk3UtzKwWfEMOY0:14920:0:99999:7:::\n\nwhere $1$amFeNcjp$PprjCKEVk3UtzKwWfEMOY0 is the encrypted password.\nCarefully delete the encrypted password leaving the all the \":\"s, so it looks like this:\nusername::14920:0:99999:7:::\n\nThen type Ctrl+O, press the Enter key to save, then Ctrl+X to close nano.\nReboot and you will have an empty (or null) password.  Be sure to use passwd username in a terminal to set  or reset your user password.\nSource for PS/2 workaround was here.\nSources for the drastic measures were here and here.\nNote on nano ― the -B option makes a backup of the original edited file, same name with a \"~\" appended.\n\nA: No, there is no way to retrieve the old password. \nYes, you can change the password without knowing the old one. The process is described on several sites on the net, easily found via a search on Google\nIf you do that however and happened to have used an encrypted /home directory for that username you are likely not to gain access to the files in your /home directory (and if you do then Ubuntu should be uninstalled...)\n\nA: If recovery mode is disabled, the method I would use is booting to a Live CD or USB. It could be the media you installed from or just another Ubuntu ISO you've downloaded and burnt. The process is fairly simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the Live media.\n\n*From the menu, open a terminal.\n\n*Find out the device name for your primary disk. sudo fdisk-l will list all partitions. Derive your partition from the list. We're looking for something like /dev/sda1 (which it will likely be)\n\n*Mount this somewhere so we can use it (obviously change the disk to the right one):\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n*Cross-mount things from the Live install so we can \"use\" the mounted disk (just copy and paste):\nfor d in dev sys run proc; do sudo mount --bind /$d /mnt/$d; done\n\n\n*Become root on the system by running sudo chroot /mnt. You can now do anything root can on the real install.\n\n*Set the password for the account:\npasswd username\n\n\n*Reboot and you're done.\n\nA: For me, on Ubuntu 16.04 VM installed in VirtualBox, when I boot into (with shift held before booting the VM) the root prompt, I always get Give root password for maintenance (or type Control-D to continue), finally I hit e at the GRUB menu with the newest recovery kernel selected in Advanced Options for Ubuntu\n\nand the hit Down scroll to the bottom, and see a line  \nlinux /boot/...  ro recovery nomodeset\n\nI scrolled to this line with Down/Up arrows, and moved to the end of this line of end, and changed ro recovery nomodeset to rw init=/bin/bash, and then hit Ctrl + x.\nThis will boot you into the system as root, and you can change your password as normal.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu does not come with an Administrative password. There is only one initial account, the user account, which can be used to execute administrative tasks. \nFor example, to get a root shell you run\n$ sudo -i\n[sudo] password for myuseraccount:         # here you type the user's password\n# \n\nA lot of people that have Unix background or experience with other distributions stumble on this issue quite often.\nThe command\nsu \n\nwill always fail because the root account is locked; it cannot be accessed directly or you cannot login directly to root.\nThere are great advantages in using the sudo facility. \n\nA: From the official Ubuntu LostPassword documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n*Hold Shift during boot to start GRUB menu\n\n*Highlight your image and press E to edit\n\n*Find the line starting with \"linux\" and append rw init=/bin/bash at the end of that line\n\n*Press Ctrl+X to boot.\n\n*Type in passwd username\n\n*Set your password.\n\n*Type in reboot. If that doesn't work, hit Ctrl+Alt+Del\nThis works for Linux Mint 14, too.\n\nA: In the boot GRUB menu, you may append init=/bin/bash to the kernel boot parameter to get a root shell.\n\nA: This is what worked for me.\n**PROCEED only if all the following step are familiar and know what happens in each step.**\n\n*\n\n*Boot using live USB\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\n*sudo nano -B /mnt/etc/shadow\n\n*remove the encrypted pwd following the user who's password you want to set it to \n\n*Save the file and quit nano\n\n*Reboot from HDD\n\n*login with the user who's password was set to \n\n*passwd <user who's password was set to empty>\nGo to beach!\n\nA: First, you have to reboot into recovery mode.\nIf you have a single-boot (Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer), to get the boot menu to show, you have to hold down the Shift key during bootup. \n\nFrom the boot menu, select recovery mode, which is usually the second boot option. \n\nAfter you select recovery mode and wait for all the boot-up processes to finish, you'll be presented with a few options.

You should then see a list of the users on your Ubuntu installation. In this case, I'm going to reset Susan Brownmiller's password.\nTo reset the password, type\npasswd username\n\nwhere username is the username you want to reset. In this case, I want to reset Susan's password, so I type\npasswd susan\n\nYou'll then be prompted for a new password.

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10\nFirst, when booting up - don't press the left shift key until the BIOS screen goes black and then immediately press and hold the left shift key.\nThen, after perhaps a minute and a number of lines of text scroll on the screen, I got the first menu, but with a couple of fewer lines - I chose the second line.\nThen I got the Recovery Menu - but when I chose Drop to Root Shell Prompt (bottom item) I was root but couldn't reset the password - because the disks were Read Only.  Type  exit\nand get back to the Recovery Menu\nThere was a choice (not shown on Jorge's screen shot) to Remount Read/Write  Used the down arrow to go to it, then left arrow to get to  and Enter - and it mounted the disk RW.\nThen again to Drop to Root Shell Prompt and I'm root and can write - so\npasswd username\nhad me enter the desired password twice - then    exit    to go back to Recovery Menu\nResume normal boot\nand everything worked fine with my new password!

(Older versions will refuse to resize a mounted partition).\nCommand line (any Ubuntu version):\nThere are three steps to this.\nStep 1.\nThe partition must first be resized. If you're using LVM, it's easy, and you presumably know how to proceed. If you're using classic partitions, it's a bit more complicated, and may require a reboot (though you never have to boot another system or live CD).\nThis is how I do it: Use fdisk to first delete the partition (the idea is that the data on disk will be preserved), then carefully recreate it with a larger size at the same position.\nExample:\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048     9437183     4717568   83  Linux\n\nCommand (m for help): d\nSelected partition 1\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\nCommand (m for help): n\nCommand action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\nSelect (default p): p\nPartition number (1-4, default 1): 1\nFirst sector (2048-10485759, default 2048):\nUsing default value 2048\nLast sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (2048-10485759, default 10485759):\nUsing default value 10485759\n\nCreated a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 10 GiB.\nPartition #1 contains a ext4 signature.\n\nDo you want to remove the signature? [Y]es/[N]o: N\n\nCommand (m for help): p\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048    10485759     5241856   83  Linux\n\nCommand (m for help): w\nThe partition table has been altered!\n\nCalling ioctl() to re-read partition table.\n\nWARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.\nThe kernel still uses the old table. The new table will be used at\nthe next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)\nSyncing disks.\n\nAgain, it is critical that the new partition starts at the same block as the old. The Id should also match (83 for Linux systems). Be prepared to lose all your data at the slightest typo.\nTo be on the safe side, you may also restore the boot flag (which according to Wikipedia is still required on some computers) by pressing a.\nSee the comment section for what to do if your swap partition is in the way.\nBy now it should be apparent why people recommend using a live CD. ;-)\nStep 2.\nAs fdisk helpfully reminds you, you must reload the partition table before proceeding. The safest way is to simply reboot; but you can also use partprobe or kpartx (more information).\nStep 3.\nOnce the partition is resized and the partition table reloaded, it's a simple matter of running resize2fs on the file system, and you can do this even when it's mounted as the root partition.\nExample:\n$ sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1\n\n\nA: I just did this successfully without umount, pivot_root, or temporary removal of the main partition, using parted 3.2 on Ubuntu 16.04, 4.4.0 kernel. To be cautious I did everything from a virtual console with networking disabled, and took a snapshot beforehand just in case, but the snapshot wasn't needed, so I could have just as well done this via SSH and without changing runlevels.\nDetermine partition size: parted /dev/sda1 print | egrep \"Disk.*GB\"\nOptionally switch to multi-user mode without networking (must be done from a console, not SSH):\nrunlevel     # remember the original runlevel\ninit 2\n\nOptionally take a VM snapshot to be cautious.\nResize partition:\nparted\np\nresizepart NUMBER SIZE\n# answer \"Yes\" when asked about resizing a live partition.\nq\n\nResize filesystem: resize2fs /dev/sda1\nIf anything goes wrong, you could restore your snapshot here.  If all went fine, return to normal runlevel (obtained above) - normally 5: init 5.  It may be better to do a full reboot at this point to make sure everything comes back properly (I had a date/ntp issue afterward).\n\nA: An easier solution - use growpart <device> <partition>:\ngrowpart /dev/xvda 1  # Grows the partition; note the space\nresize2fs /dev/xvda1  # Grows the filesystem\n\nAs always, back up your partition table (sfdisk -d /dev/xvda > partition_bak.dmp) just in case.\ngrowpart is part of cloud-utils. In case you don't have it, you can install with:\nsudo apt-get install cloud-utils \n\n\nA: Yes, you can shrink/move/grow an online root partition without any reboots (nor livecd, nor usbkey): consult this answer. It's very well written and easy to follow, although quite long and a little risky. So if you only want to grow your ext4 partition, you can stick to the conventional working resize2fs solutions. \nThe general solution I've lnked will work on any type of dedicated or VPS solution for instance.\nTLDR; this solution implies to pivot_root to tmpfs so you can umount safely your root partition live and fiddle with it. Once done, you'll pivot_root back on your new root partition.\nThis allows pretty much any manipulation on the root file system (move it, change filesystem, changing it's physical device...).\nNo reboot are required in the process, and this allows to bypass limitation of resize2fs not being able to shrink ext4 partitions.\nI have personally used this, and it works very well on debian system also, so it should work on Ubuntu. I'm very surprised not to see this in-depth solution a little more linked to the many question in stackexchange web sites that deals with the same issue.\nNote: Of course if you want to grow your partition, a simple resize2fs will be enough as stated in numerous places and in other answers here.\n\nA: It is possible to do a on-line resize of a ext4 filesystem, even if it's your root partition. Use the resize2fs command.\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda1\n\nEDIT: On-line shrinking is not allowed:\nroot@brunojcm-htpc:/home# resize2fs /dev/sda5 2654693\nresize2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nFilesystem at /dev/sda5 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required\nresize2fs: On-line shrinking not supported\n\n\nA: You could also just make use of GParted - as long as the partition you are resizing is not the one you booted from - else I suggest the live CD option is somewhat easier for newbies.\nGParted basically does all of the steps - just based on a GUI fronted.\n\nA: I would like to make an extension on the answer of @Søren Løvborg: extending the partition with a swap partition present.\nFirst the layout of the disk after extending it:\n$sudo parted /dev/sda 'unit s print' free\nModel: ATA VBOX HARDDISK (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 14336000s\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags:\n\nNumber  Start      End        Size       Type      File system     Flags\n        63s        2047s      1985s                Free Space\n 1      2048s      10485759s  10483712s  primary   ext4            boot\n        10485760s  10487805s  2046s                Free Space\n 2      10487806s  12580863s  2093058s   extended\n 5      10487808s  12580863s  2093056s   logical   linux-swap(v1)\n        12580864s  14335999s  1755136s             Free Space\n\nSo sda1 needs to be extended with the free space at the end of the disk, but the swap partition is in between them.

I've finally swapped my old CRT monitor for a LCD, so the next step it to optimise the PC power usage. It's using an AMD 64 X2 4600+ CPU which I know can trottle down, but seems to be running at a constant 2.4GHz.\nA while back I heard about Granola.

I know I tried installing cpufreqd and powernowd, but either caused Granola to be uninstalled.

I can see current speed with\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nand to time at each speed with\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state\n\nI'm assuming both cores run at the same speed.

Somehow gnome-open and xdg-open are now hopelessly broken. Setting my default browser in System -> Preferences -> Preferred Applications changes nothing. \nWhen I click on any link that points to a webpage, it opens a New Tab Page in Chromium (Or my Home page if I set one). Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: There are several ways to control what browser will open links, and a given application can also choose to prefer a different method, apart from the usual conventions.\nIf you are clicking on an html file from the desktop or from within Nautilus, you can control how the browser will open it by right-clicking on the HTML document and choosing properties.  \n\nFrom the command line, try sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser . \nThis uses Debian's alternatives system.   It will present you with a list of reasonable options from which you can choose to select.  \nTo see what is available to the alternatives system, you will use the --list argument on the target component.  For example:\n% update-alternatives --list x-www-browser\n    /usr/bin/chromium-browser\n    /usr/bin/epiphany-browser\n    /usr/bin/firefox\n    /usr/bin/firefox-4.0\n    /usr/bin/google-chrome\n    /usr/bin/midori\n\nThis can be different from the Gnome 'Preferred Applications' setting.  Another potential source of conflict exists if you have the BROWSER environment variable set.   You can see if you have anything defined for it by typing env | grep BROWSER . \nIt appears that xdg-open and gnome-open don't follow the settings in the alternatives list.  sensible-browser (which can be also launched via the command-line or from a script) does, but xdg-open and gnome-open should already be looking at the choice you made in 'Preferred Application.'

Press ctrl + c to\ncopy the location to the clipboard.\n\n*Press ctrl + l to open the location bar.\n\n*ctrl + v to paste the file's location followed by enter.\n\n\nIt's not as convenient as the Nautilus actions method, but it avoids installing a package that might in principle, have security issues.\n\nA: Jadonchristensen found a way to add \"Open parent folder\" to Nautilus' context menu:\n1) install Nautilus Actions from terminal: \n    sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions    \n\n2) run Nautilus Actions from terminal:\n    nautilus-actions-config-tool\n\n3) click on 'Add New Action' and fill the form as in the following:\n    label = Open Parent Folder\n    path = nautilus\n    parameters = %d\n\n5) save and exit\n6) then simply right-clicking on the search result and selecting \"Open parent folder\" will do the trick.\n\nIt would be interesting to know if it's possible to open the containing folder in a NEW TAB rather than a new window. \nIs there an option one can add to the nautilus command?\n\nSuccessfully tested in\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu GnomeShell Remix 12.04 AMD64\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 x64\n\n\nA: It's not possible with the default nautilus that is currently shipping with Ubuntu. If you'd like to see this feature, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask nautilus or nautilus-elementary projects to add the feature. (go to their project website to get in touch with them)\n\n*Ask a nautilus plugin developer (like me) to write a quick python plugin to add the option.\n\n\nA: The GNOME 3 Nautilus component in its version 3.10 (provided with Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr) has a new option \"Open Item Location\" in the item selection context menu of a search. It opens the parent folder of the selected item, and differs from jadonchristensen's Nautilus custom action (reported by scrondo) for the selection context menu in 2 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*The option \"Open Item Location\" is only displayed in the context of a search and in the Recent place (listing files recently accessed). The custom action is always displayed, but outside a search it will merely refreshes the content of the current folder. In the Recent place, it will not work as expected and will open the root directory instead.\n\n*In search mode, selecting \"Open Item Location\" opens the item's parent folder in the same tab, whereas the custom Nautilus action opens it in a new window except if a tab is already opened on the same location (in which case the focus will move on this tab).\n\n\nI do not know if there are some ways to configure the custom action so that its behavior matches the new \"Open Item Location\". It seems especially difficult for the Recent place, which is neither a physical folder nor the result of a classic search.\n", "Q: How are typical users expected to read the documentation in /usr/share/doc? I recently learned that there is a huge pile of documentation in /usr/share/doc.\nIt seems like much of it is gzipped so that it is not directly accessible without administrative privileges:\n$ gunzip examples/letter.tex.gz \ngzip: examples/letter.tex: Permission denied\n\nWhile one solution to this would be for every user to duplicate each item in their home directory just to read it, this arrangement hardly seems conducive to regular browsing.\nHow do normal people read this documentation?\nI am not inclined to believe that the typical user is expected to install and maintain a web server just to read local text documentation.\n\nA: First install apache2\nsudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc  \n\napache2-doc is the special case here. It allows you to browse your documentation /usr/share/doc/ through your web browser. fro http://localhost/doc/.\nThis does not work out right though. You need to change the configuration of Apache to get it to decompress and show the *.gz files as plain text. \nI posted on Stack Overflow to get a way to use Apache to show the content of *.gz documents in the /usr/share/doc/ directory. This is what was posted as possible solution. \nHere are those instructions in brief. It tells Apache how to deal with .gz files to process them as plain text and send them to the browser as plain text. \nsudo a2enmod headers   \nsudo a2enmod deflate  \ngksu gedit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default \n\nGo to the bottom of the file and find the section with Alias /doc/ \"/usr/share/doc/\"\nand change it to look like this. \nAlias /doc/ \"/usr/share/doc/\"\n<Directory /usr/share/doc>\n    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n    Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128\n\n    AddEncoding gzip gz\n    <FilesMatch \"\\.gz$\">\n      ForceType text/plain\n      Header set Content-Encoding: gzip\n    </FilesMatch>\n</Directory>   \n\nThen restart Apache:\nsudo apache2ctl restart   \n\n\nA: Most has been said and very nicely explained by jgbelacqua for use in terminal. Just adding this for people that are on a desktop manager:\nFrom a graphical desktop (here GNOME) the easiest way to read docs from /usr/share/doc is to (double-)click open the zipped files with your standard archive manager (here File Roller) from where you can (double-)click open and read them in your standard editor (here Gedit). No write permissions needed as long as you don't unzip the files.\n\nA: gunzip file.gz attempts to uncompress file.gz to file, removing file.gz. That is why you get a \"Permission denied\" error, you are not allowed to write in /usr/share/doc. To get the contents of a file, use gunzip -c file.gz or zcat file.gz.\nReading gzip-compressed textfiles can be done with zless. As it names might suggest, it is just less, but for gzip-compressed files.\nExample usage:\nzless /usr/share/doc/bash/NEWS.gz\n\nThe .gz suffix can be omitted as well:\nzless /usr/share/doc/bash/NEWS\n\n\nA: There are at least two issues here: \n\n\n*\n\n*reading the .gz files painlessly\n\n*permissions on the directories\n\n*(optional for tex files)\n\n\nFor #1, there are a number of applications that will cope with the gzipped files seamlessly.  A couple that you could use are less and vim .  \n less README.gz \n vim -R README.Debian.gz\n view Important.bits.gz\n\nview is an alias for vim -R, which just says to open the file read-only.   \nIn the old days, before less was installed on my system, I would use gzcat and pipe the output to another utility. Apparently, it is only called zcat now on Ubuntu, but you would use it like this, e.g.:\n /usr/share/doc/xpdf$ zcat changelog.Debian.gz  | more\n\nzcat is still available, and using it to pipe compressed contents somewhere can be useful in some cases.  (For situations with .bz2 files, bzcat is available.)\nFor #2, all of the files that I've seen under /usr/share/doc are in directories with other+rx permissions, meaning that all users can search the directories (e.g., list contents) and read files inside.  What you can't do (since only root has write permission by default), is to create files.   Because you are attempting to unzip into that directory, I imagine it is giving you permission denied because you have read but not write permissions by default. \nFor #3, I'm guessing you use .tex files more than I do.   But here's one way to deal with them without copying to home or a temp file.  For this, you are going to create a named pipe, but you can reuse that for your other tex piping and processing needs. \nIt should go like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*zcat or gzcat the text \n\n*... and pipe that to your TeX processor\n\n*... and send that to your Named Pipe (here, I'll call him pipey)\n\n*... and then in a separate screen grab your output from pipey \n\n*... and send that to a dvi display process. \n\n\nYou can obviously alter these steps if you use different or better utilities than the ones here.  \nMy example will use the mkfifo utility to create the named pipe, pipey .  The target file to process is /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.tex.gz . \nYou'll need two shell command lines available (via terminal, Alt+F2, or however).\nYou'll type in \nterminal one: \nmkfifo pipey\nYou now have a persistent named pipe.  You can use ls -l to peek at it.\nzcat /usr/share/doc/gdb/refcard.tex.gz | tex > pipey\nNotice that this command will not return until you do something with the output that's gone to the named pipe. \nNow, in terminal two, you'll type: tex pipey | xdvi\nAnd it works (well, here anyway).  The process can be refined for prettier output, but if you're looking for quick and relatively mess-free, that's one way to do it. \n\nA: Maybe that's too late to answer, but I've found the best solution (both ease of use and completeness)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dwww \n\nA typical Linux system has documentation in many formats (manual pages,\n         Info files, READMEs, and so on).  dwww makes it possible to access  all\n         of  these  via the same interface, a WWW browser.

How do I install the HP Deskjet F4280 All-in-One printer?\n\nA: HOWTO: Install HP Printers for Beginners\nThis is a little guide on how to correctly install an HP printer, since so many people seem to have trouble with this. I have also provided a very basic scanner start up guide. Here are the steps:\nPrinting:\nFirst of all, connect your printer to your computer, and turn it on.\nSee if your printer gets autodetected by Ubuntu. If it does, something will pop up saying it is configured for use and is ready.\nIf nothing happens, simply go to System > Administration > Printing > New.\nIf it doesn't find any or doesn't recognize your printer, try the following:\nFirst check on this website if your printer is compatible with linux.\nIf it is compatible, then follow the instructions on this page to install and configure the drivers.\nScanning:\nFor HP all-in-ones (such as the PSC series), after you have followed the above steps, put the paper you want to scan in the scanner and then go to Applications > Graphics > XSane Image scanning program. In XSane, click \"scan\" and then when it's done, click save as and save it wherever you want.\nIf you have a sole HP scanner, then you could try to just plug it in, turn it on, and try to scan it with XSane, but I don't gurantee that it will work.\n***NOTE: If you want to send a scan that you made on your linux box to a windows computer, it won't open it up. You have to right-click on the image, and go to \"open with GIMP Image Editor\". Then go to save as and click on \"select file type (by extension)\". Then scroll down to JPEG format and click ok as many times so that it saves. It'll then be readable in windows.\n\nA: I have an HP F4280 too and it works out of the box with 9.10, 10.04 and 10.10.  Just \"start it up and plug it in\"... prints beautiful and scans great with XSane and SimpleScan. \n", "Q: High I/O wait after login I've noticed that the ubuntuone-syncdaemon hogs up the hard disk every time I log in to Ubuntu (10.04). This takes up to two or three minutes, which makes Ubuntu insufferably slow. Opening Firefox is okay, but the browser is constantly greyed out and lags horribly.\nGiven that I often shut down my laptop when I don't use it (about 3 to 4 times a day), this makes Ubuntu lose much of its lustre because of its long boot time. Is this a normal behaviour of Ubuntu One? Is it intended?\nNote that I've actually posted this in the forums here, but I received only few replies.\n\nA: It is a known issue in ubuntuone-syncdaemon versions prior to what's currently in Natty. We're working on getting backports of the fix to this (and many more) issues backported to 10.04; unfortunately we didn't make it in time for 10.04.2, but we'll try to get things into a PPA soon (within a month or so). I'll update this answer when we do that.\n", "Q: Synchronising Cut-and-Paste Activities in Ubuntu One This was posted in the Ubuntu Forums but received no response, so I'm re-posting it here (with minor updates) in hopes that it will at least get some comments.\nRecently, I moved a large amount of contents (a few GBs) within the Ubuntu One folder (through cut-and-paste). Then I discovered how Ubuntu One does this is to remove them on the server side and upload all the files again in the new location. Obviously, this is undesirable because of the hefty uploading involved. Worse, since I have two computers synced to the same account, it is double the amount of traffic. Each computer took about one day to finish synchronising.\nFirstly, can anyone confirm that this is actually what's happening when we move folders? I'm using Ubuntu 10.04, by the way. Secondly, is there a way to cut-and-paste stuff within the Ubuntu One folder without uploading again?\n\nA: At the moment Ubuntu One does re-upload files on move, which I agree is not great. There's no other way to cut and paste without triggering this.\nWe are fixing this for Natty, I expect the fix to land within the next 2 months along with many more performance improvements.\n", "Q: Can you change the update interval for the hardware-monitor applet? I want to change the update interval of the hardware-monitor applet. There's no setting for it in preferences...\n\nA: The hardware monitor applet gets its data from lm-sensors, the data is taken raw from the system and lm-sensors does not limit the amount of times it collects this information so unless you are good at programming and want to help the hardware monitor team add the function your best bet at the moment would be to create a script to switch on and off the lm-sensors service at regular intervals to dictate how often the data is sent to the applet.\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Is there any version of Vim which uses the libxft library to render fonts?

I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on my laptop (an Asus G73j), dual-booting Windows 7 if that matters. After using the computer for couple of hours or so, I get a popup complaining that a file was unmounted, then my GNOME desktop panels disappear. I can't save any unsaved work (the file browser shows \"Filesystem\" as totally empty), and other programs break in odd ways (like Chrome can't browse to any new pages, but keeps current ones going... at least I still have Pandora to listen to when this happens!).\nI've tried looking in the system logs to no avail; I'm assuming that it can't write any errors to the logs because, of course, the logs are on the primary hard drives.\nThis started happening maybe a few days ago. Yesterday I upgraded from 10.4, but I believe it was happening before then. Any advice for figuring this out?\n\nEDIT: It just happened again, and I heard a small little clicky sound from the hard drive about five seconds before things went south. I'm thinking I should start backing up ASAP.\n\nIn response to a comment, here's the dmesg output: http://askubuntu.pastebin.com/uYGshBay\nAlso, the SMART status says the disk has a few bad sectors, and the detailed data says there are 14. It says it passed the self-assessment though.\nLastly, this doesn't seem to be happening when I'm on Windows. I recently re-enabled ureadahead (which I disabled ages ago because it was causing Ubuntu to hang at the startup logo), could that be the source of the problem? I've disabled it again to see.\n\nA: The dmesg output shows filesystem errors. Therefore, the message you got was probably about remounting the root filesystem as read-only, and not allowing you to write on it, until it gets fixed.\nWhat you need to do is provide S.M.A.R.T. information for your hard disk to figure out whether the problem is actually a hardware issue. Apart from Disk Utility you can use\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda\n\nThen, any output you get from about put it on PasteBin.

It seemed the most likely candidate. SO i guess that will show itself.\n\nA: From the data you provided, the size of your logical volumes is as follows:\npartition     :     size :       filesystem size \n/dev/nvaws/home :   60  :         60\n/dev/nvaws/usr   :  40 :          20                 \n/dev/nvaws/db     : 5:            5  \nthis looks ok, although you can extend your /usr filesystem if you need, to fill the lv.\nthe area that is causing the errors is none of the logical volumes but your root partition, which is the / directory (raid device md0)\nThis is 5.7gb in size (see first line of output of df command), and is 94% full. The / partition contains kernel files for booting (in /boot), config files (in /etc) and various log files in /var.\nYou must extend this / partition or reduce the usage - \nYou must either extend this partition, or run tools to discover if there is anything than can be safely removed.\nI would start with removing old kernel files no longer required since these can be rather large (use ubuntu tweak application to do this), and also check size of logfiles in /var by running du -ksh /var/*\nYou may have lots of package files lying around as a result of software centre downloads. Ubuntu tweak - package cleaner will also help with clearing the cache.\n", "Q: Mouse Cursor Freezes Randomly with Intel GMA 950 I'm using Ubuntu 10.10.

Any slight change in the output of zsync in a newer version would likely break it. (Only tested against Ubuntu 10.04's zsync v0.6.1). For some odd reason it outputs some of the progress to stdout, and some to stderr, which makes it extra hard to parse.\nAlso, it won't handle certain odd characters in filenames, like \\, * or newlines.\nExpect bugs; I haven't really tested it that much.\nAnyway, I had never heard of zsync before. It's a neat tool, so thanks for letting me know about it at least. :)\nScreenshots : \n\n\n", "Q: Is there a Powerpoint (PPT) to text/html converter?

PackageKit is being used alongside a de-branded Ubuntu Software Center in a project called AppStream\nAs soon as the debian-packagekit integration is perfect, I'm sure Ubuntu can ship it.\n\nA: I'll be working at PackageKit backend for Ubuntu Software Center, as a Google Summer of Code this summer. With a bit of luck, this can be done.\n", "Q: What about the performance enhancement when using an SSD as the main disk? I'm planning to buy a new PC and I am thinking about using an SSD as the main disk. I'd also use a standard spinning disk and I'd mount it to /home.\nTo the people already using such a setup: does this induce a practical, noticeable enhancement in performance?\nI think that access times, rather than transfer rates, are the more useful feature of SSD's. I would like to know if they have a noticeable effect on a desktop installation of Ubuntu. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Speeds up boot and application launch significantly.  I keep my main /home on it as well and mount the bulk storage elsewhere so that when I'm not using it, that disk can spin down.\n\nA: My setup is an SSD for / and a spinning disk for /home and it's great for boot time, installation of packages, and launch time of applications. \nI detailed my set up here for a similar question. \n\nA: \nI think that access times, rather than transfer rates, are the more useful feature of SSD's.\n\nThat's certainly one massive improvement. Yes, the random-access time on my current and past SSDs have both been around 0.2ms. I upgraded from a fast mechanical disk (WD Raptor) and the boot-up on the SSD just blew me away. It does so much, so fast.\nOf course ureadahead and other tools aim to make the boot-up as linear as possible (they essentially write a whole load of files that are needed at boot into one sequential block) but that's where the SSD's second benefit comes in: huge maximum-throughput speeds.\nThe sustainable transfer speed of my first SSD (OCZ Agility) was around 200MB/s. My new SSD (OCZ Revodrive - a PCI-E card) tops out at around 540MB/s. The Revodrive X2 reaches somewhere around 750MB/s. There are solutions that scrape 2GB/s but they're prohibitively expensive for most people.\n\nLike your plans, I started with my entire home being bind-mounted onto a RAID array on mechanical disks. This was good and is technically much more secure but it does limit the ability for the computer to really fly.\nBrowsers and other database heavy applications (feed readers, email apps, etc) need fast access to the disk to work well. You might want to weigh up how valuable your data really is, and if some of it can perhaps stay on the SSD and survive with the occasional backup.\nKeeping various often-accessed files (like the Firefox database or gnome settings) on multiple mechanical disks is also pretty noisy. I have quiet, fairly slow disks and even I find it annoying when loading something causes 4 disks to start clunking away (I have 4-way RAID5). Perhaps this is something that you learn to appreciate after living with a silent SSD for a while.\nThese days the only things that are on the RAID are users' documents. That is ~/Documents, ~/Music, ~/Photos, ~/Vidoes and (for disk space reasons more than anything) ~/.wine. Everything else either gets an occasional backup (Firefox/F-Spot/etc SQLite3 databases once a day). I try to run a monthly proper ~/ backup (excluding the stuff that is on RAID) once a month, but I'm yet to cron it.\nThis is a good compromise for me. I get a lightning fast computer and all my really important data is quite safe and all my semi-important data gets backed up regularly.\n\nA: Boot time increases visibly. With Dell Inspiron Mini 10v (1011), the difference is up to 10 seconds compared to a HDD (click on bootchart links to see it graphically). \n", "Q: About the use of dotted hostname with avahi I recently discovered avahi. It help you when you when to resolve hostname for the local network. But in my situation I've got a issue.\nI decided to host a machine called a.alpha and a another called b.alpha.\nIn a near future I will also use some machine called a.beta and b.beta.\nMy problem is that from a.alpha I can resolve a.alpha.local hostname, but currently I can't resolve a.alpha.local from b.alpha.\nSo when I will decide to use the .beta extension I will have some issues.\nIs it normal that the machine \"a.alpha\" doesn't expos the entire hostname to mdns ?\nI know i can change the naming method (saying use a-alpha instead of a.alpha). But I like it this way.\nSo the question is:\nIs it possible to use dotted name in the /etc/hostname and to resolve it using avahi?\n\nA: see https://serverfault.com/questions/229331/linitation-in-linux-hostname-about-dot\n", "Q: Is it possible to do a remote wipe of a system? My office had a break-in over the weekend, and several laptops were stolen. Mine wasn't one of them, but I'm curious - the owners of the stolen computers (Windows and Mac) are all talking about remote wipe software. Is there anything like this for Linux? Something that would allow me to remotely wipe my system if it's ever lost or stolen.\n\nA: Prey has some limited wiping ability. It can delete some files (including passwords an thunderbird mails) and can lock the computer.\nIt's way easier to setup and use than a ssh server, but it's much less flexible and powerful.\n\nA: Yes. Several solutions exist, and I guess a relatively simple one would be to use dyndns or some sort of dynamic dns service combined with an ssh server on your laptop: then, as soon as the stolen laptop is connected to the internet, you can connect to it and erase its content.\n\nA: If you are worried about data that get stolen, you should not trust software for wiping data. The clever thief use a LiveCD or takes out the hard drive to browse / copy the data.\nThe best way to prevent data theft is by encrypting the (whole) drive. This will add a small performance hit, but your data will stay save. I'm using LUKS for full disk encryption.

The Alps touchpads tend not to have multitouch, while they use the same driver as the Synaptic touchpads.\nYou can use synclient -l to obtain information on your touchpad.\nStill, the definitive way to see how many fingers are supported on your touchpad, is to \n\n\n*\n\n*Enable SHMConfig in your xorg.conf file\n\n*Run synclient -m 100, which will show in real time the status of your touchpad. The fifth column labeled f is for fingers, therefore you can see up to how many fingers you can tap at the same time.\n\n\nTo enable SHMConfig in xorg.conf, see http://mjg59.livejournal.com/118588.html and then add\nSection \"InputClass\"\n   Identifier \"enable synaptics SHMConfig\"\n   MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n   MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n   Option \"SHMConfig\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nto your xorg.conf. You can remove the above snippet once you performed your testing.\n\nA: I was able to activate the two finger scrolling using the hack described by this post:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9058534&postcount=2\nUnfortunately, the options get reset by some other daemon every once in a while and when the computer goes to sleep.\nHopefully someone can figure out another way to do this.\n\nA: On the Sony VAIO VPCF136FM, the following command works to add edge scrolling on the ALPS touchpad in Ubuntu 12.04 (and Linux Mint 11, as an aside, if anyone cares):\nRun from the terminal:\necho \"options psmouse proto=imps\"|sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf; sudo modprobe -r psmouse; sudo modprobe psmouse\n\nOr, for readability, follow these steps instead, which do the same thing:\nCreate a file called \"psmouse.conf\" in /etc/modprobe.d:\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf\n\nAdd the following line to this file, and save:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\nLastly, reload the drivers:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nWhile this isn't two-finger scrolling, it's the next best thing, and the only type of touchpad scrolling that I've been able to get working on this platform. I'm pretty happy with it, and I hope it helps others.\nThe source was from Oscar's link:  Source: [regression] Alps touchpad detected, but scrolling not working LP bug #737051, but I didn't need to install the driver or do anything else mentioned in that thread. I even undid some of the other things I tried, just to be sure the psmouse.conf file in /etc/modprobe.d is all I needed.\nAlso, note that this is a bit of a hack, as the touchpad is loaded as a ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse, and the Touchpad tab disappears from the Mouse Settings menu. However, this is a lot less annoying than having to drag the mouse pointer to the sidebar everytime I want to scroll.\nLastly, I haven't yet rebooted on Linux Mint 11 (not that it matters much here), so the modprobe commands may need to be added to a startup script, if the edge scroll doesn't survive the reboot. However, on Ubuntu 12.04, the one that matters on AskUbuntu, the scroll continues to work even after the reboot.\n\nA: I just found the dirver from an ubuntu DELL image shipped with my Latitude, check this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/278133/65801\n", "Q: Sync only selected subfolders to UbuntuOne?

I want to have the same workflow in my text editor and shell of choice.\nAnyone has got around this?\n\nA: There is some information about key-binding in this bash reference manual.\nTo edit key bindings in gnome-terminal, go to Edit->KeyBoard Shortcuts. \nWhile I'm not convinced that what you want to do is absolutely impossible (this is linux after all), I do believe that it will turn into more trouble than it's worth.  Editors and shells are meant to be used for very different purposes and were designed with these very different purposes in mind.  In the long run, I think you'll be better off learning how to use each tool as it was intended to be used (especially if you ever have to use someone else's computer).  Switching between editor and shell becomes second nature with just a little practice.\nUpdate:\nAs pointed out by djeikyb in the comments, bash does support vi mappings.  If you are willing to learn how to use vi, that may be what you are looking for.  Here is a quick write up on vi key bindings in bash, with cheat sheet.\n\nA: This is impossible: on the one hand you have a terminal (which hosts a bash shell) and where - as you say - some combinations are already taken. On the other hand, you use gedit which doesn't allow changing key combinations. \n", "Q: Support TrendNet TEW-643PI Wireless N network card Has anyone been able to get a TrendNet TEW-643PI Wireless N card working under Ubuntu?

In Ubuntu 10.10, when I insert a CD or DVD into my optical drive, the system mounts the CD in a folder called /media/XYZ where XYZ is the disk's label.  This has cause problems with Wine, as in order for an application to verify that an application's CD is present, Wine uses a symlinks to point to a mounted CD's folder.  In this case, that folder must be /media/XYZ, but when using a different application, the folder would be different.

Over the time there is an increasing number of hidden .configuration folders in my home folder.\nMany of these come from applications I only installed for testing or from applications that I don't use any more. I would not mind really but these folders do clutter my home, and worse than that sum up to as much as 80 GBytes by now. As there are also applications I never heard of (at least I can't remember I had installed them) I hesitate to delete them.\nIs there a way to find out which folders came from purged applications? May there even be a way to auto-remove a configuration folder when purging (not removing) the application that created it?\n\nA: I can't think of a quick fix short of going through deleting what you know isn't installed and manually Googling what you can't identify. It's a horrible problem that I've just opted for the Etch-a-Sketch method and either deleted my whole profile or have deleted large chunks of it (.config, .gnome-2, etc)\nThe only long term solution I could think of doing this is setting up an online database of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Packages\n\n*What configuration paths they use\n\n\nYou'd store that information in a simple JSON \"database\", perhaps gzip it and store it somewhere online.\nYou'd then have a tool that downloaded this global list and scanned the paths, looking for corresponding paths in the user's home. Where there are matches, you check the package list to see if that package is still installed. If it's not, it goes on a death-list.\nAfter that scan, the user gets a list of available clean-up operations (with detail on what package the program thinks it is) and it given the option to nuke whatever they like.\nIn a perfect world, we'd have this integrated right into the packaging system (and have apt-get clean-my-home), but I think that's a pipe dream. Maintainers would have to do a ton of work on top of requiring reengineering the package database formats (which are shakey enough already).\nAs getting this written into the fabric of each package is unappealing, there also needs to be some sort of interface for normal people to suggest paths for packages. (As it's my dayjob) I'd probably suggest a quick and dirty web-app where people can make their suggestions and MOTUs, Ubuntu members, etc can moderate the flow to make sure people aren't suggesting potentially dangerous searches.\nAs it is, it's going to require a whole load of manpower to get the however-many thousand apps that write home-files.\nThis is an interesting problem. This might give me a good excuse to play with Quickly's cli template (Quickly because I'm a Pythonista and also because packaging scares me).\n\nA: Have you tried ubuntu-tweak for getting rid of old conf-files? :)\nYou can also use sudo apt-get purge PACKET-NAME to really get rid of the package. \n*Edit:\nYou can also try sudo apt-get install bleachbit for 'easy' tidying.\n", "Q: How do I resize my emacs22 window?

Theres a Windows 7 partition of 30GB, followed by 20GB of unallocated space, then HP's Windows recovery partition of under 10GB.\nDo I need to format the empty space in windows first? What's the recommended method in this case?\n\nA: You do not need to format the unallocated space. You can do this during the installation of Ubuntu.\nFrom what you mention, you have two partitions already (Win, Recovery), and you need two more partitions, the Linux partition and the swap partition. For the swap partition, make it to be twice your RAM (it's a rule of thumb) and the rest goes to the Linux partition. Therefore, create the swap partition first, then allocate what is left to the Linux partition.\nAlso read at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for generic help of the process.\n\nA: You can format it from within the Ubuntu installer. There will be an option to do manual partitioning. Just select the unallocated space. You will need to create 2 partitions within that space, one swap partition and one partition to house Ubuntu itself. I would take a look at the Ubuntu partitioning guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition\n", "Q: How can I automatically mute the volume at every boot?

I would still like to know\n  how gnome is getting the laptop to suspend under lid closure and\n  fn-F4 so that I could manage it myself.\n\n\nA: I been using the pm-* (power management) tools under xfce4.  Call sudo pm-suspend or sudo pm-hibernate from a panel button.

Alt+Space does not allow me to move or resize. Rebooting did not help. I ended up removing the .mozilla directory which solved it, but lost all my settings. In case it matters, I'm using 2 monitors. Any info on this?\n\nA: One thing you can do with any window that has important bits below or above the screen edge is hold down alt while click and dragging with your left mouse button. It will let you drag the window around wherever you need. You can also resize by holding down alt while click and dragging with your right mouse button.\nI suspect that you'll be fine once you resize Firefox down to something reasonable. After that, feel free to maximize the window or resize normally.\n\nA: It may be possible that you previously went into full-screen mode (F11), and then exited from Firefox. \nThere appears to have been a bug, where the full-screen size is remembered by Firefox, but not not that it was in full-screen mode.\n", "Q: Accidentally overlapped the Gnome and Unity interfaces.

This is useful for watching releases of things.\nThe problem with doing this through a random search engine for Ubuntu is that you usually get too many torrents as it picks up different custom versions, and other software with the name in the title/description.

Our focus is on providing a quality and stable experience for users. This does not always mean having the latest version available at all times. Remember that Mono is also the basis for a large number of applications, including some which are in the default install. It's therefore critical that it functions as well as possible. Basically “new” isn't always what is best for the distribution.\nFurthermore, packaging and QAing a major upstream revision is a huge effort, and as the team is comprised entirely of volunteers, this has to be done when time presents itself.\nThe groundwork towards making 2.10 available (rc1 was recently released) is under way.\n\nA: Novell who is the major sponsor of mono has chosen not to provide Ubuntu packages. The packages used in Ubuntu come from the community. The Community has not yet packaged ubuntu 2.8 and so ubuntu 11.04 is stuck using the old mono 2.6 packages.\nMaybe this is a solution \nhttp://www.integratedwebsystems.com/2010/10/mono-2-8-install-script-for-ubuntu-fedora/\n\nA: I have ubuntu 11.04, with mono 2.6.7 - see http://mono-project.com/DistroPackages/Ubuntu\nTo get the latest ironpython 2.7.1 working, I have to update mono.\nSo I install mono 2.10.5, nicely build by Jo Shields on http://badgerports.org/\nHe said it is for ubuntu 10.04, but knowing from the first link that 10.04 and 11.04 both used mono 2.6.7, I try the update and bingo ! no errors, and ironpython starts :\nmono ../IronPython-2.7.1/ipy.exe\nIronPython 2.7.1 (2.7.0.40) on .NET 4.0.30319.1\n\n", "Q: Login to a network domain I have a laptop which is dual boot with Windows XP and Ubuntu 10.10.\nOn Windows it always logs into the domain and I am able to connect to over \nethernet since it is based on the domain.\nHowever on my Ubuntu I use hostname as ubuntu which is default.\nHow do I ensure that it uses the same hostname and domain as in Windows.\nIs there a way to migrate the settings from Windows?\nThanks\nMadhava\n\nA: There's a tool in the Ubuntu repositories called likewise-open that allows you to join an Ubuntu machine to a domain hosted by Active Directory. Once you join your machine to the domain, you can log in to Ubuntu using your domain account (although I have had to type in my full user name, DOMAIN/user, to get it to work properly).\nYou will need to have special \"Domain Admin\" privileges to join your computer, however; you may have to ask someone from your IT department to use their domain account if you don't have these.\n\nA: To change the hostname:\ngksudo gedit /etc/hostname\n\nReplace 'ubuntu' with the new hostname.

I have installed Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron on my system. The interface eth0 is not at all detected and when I go to System->Administrator->Network in the menu I do not getting an option for wired connection. Only the Wireless connection and Point to Point connection tabs are available.\n\nA: As Martin says, you need to install a newer version of Ubuntu. Mobile Internet support has become more mature in recent versions of Ubuntu, with the work carried out in the NetworkManager package.\nRead, for example, the discussion, at http://www.crazyengineers.com/forum/general-help/37747-how-setup-bsnl-3g-data-card-ubuntu-10-10-guide.html\n(Once you get Ubuntu 10.10) The typical information that is missing to configure mobile internet is the APN. From what I see about BSNL/India, the information is already in (the newer version of) Ubuntu, see http://git.gnome.org/browse/mobile-broadband-provider-info/tree/serviceproviders.xml\nSo, try to get a newer version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you have wired modem connection, then you can follow these steps to connect to internet.\nOpen terminal and type sudo pppoeconf.

Popular options: you are asked if you want the 'noauth' and 'defaultroute' options and to remove 'nodetach' - choose \"Yes\".\n   6. Use peer DNS - choose \"Yes\".\n   7. Limited MSS problem - choose \"Yes\".\n   8. When you are asked if you want to connect at start up, you will probably want to say yes.\n   9.

There is nothing to configure. Ubuntu can detect broadband automatically in most cases. However some may feel difficulties because their modem is in pppoe mode so they  requires a dialer software(pppoe dialer) for connecting to Internet. It's hard to get a suitable pppoe dialer in Ubuntu. So, for connecting BSNL broadband, change your modem configuration as multiuser type(in bridge mode).\nhttp://www.beubuntu.co.cc/2010/03/connect-bsnl-broadband-in-ubuntu-hai.html#comments\n\nA: I am assuming that you are using the broadband via landline.

Also if possible please try upgrading to 10.10.\n\nA: My first question, can you provide your ethernet card manufacturer from Windows 7? \nIt is very much possible that your ethernet is not detected because the driver required for detection is a non-free driver. Click on System -> Preferences -> Add Hardware Drivers. If the non-free driver is indeed required, Ubuntu will show you what driver is required from that program. \nThen you can download that .deb file from Windows and install in UBuntu.\nHope this helps!\nAlso, as others have suggested please update to the latest LTS version, which is 10.04.\n", "Q: Monitor resolution messed up, monitor is unknown Is there anyway to reset my monitor?

The VPN Server gave me an exe file - connection manager - to connect to the server.  Instead, I created a pptp vpn connection under nm-applet, entering only Host, Username & password.\nLater I figured out there were more options that needed to be set. I extracted the .exe file contents, and found a .cms file with some options that looked relevant, but I didn't know how to set them under Ubuntu. \nHere is the file content http://pastebin.com/FmgkFBcS\n\nA: You may only be missing the actual encryption method, which seems to be specified in the \n\n[Server&PPTP  2.8]\n\nand \n\n[Server&PPTP  2.8 Tunnel]\n\nblocks from your example. This should roughly translate to the Advanced window in nm-applet's PPTP VPN configuration:\n\nI'd suggest first trying to enable MPPE and keeping all other options as default (so that it enabled MPPE, which offers encryption, and MSCHAP-type authentication methods, which are enabled in your example for the PPTP 2.8 section). If it doesn't work, disable all the authentication options but PAP, so that things would equate to about the same as the \"PPTP 2.8 Tunnel\" section in your example.\nIf it's any use, there is now a bug open on Launchpad about supporting the import of CMS-type configuration in NetworkManager: bug 711282\n\nA: According to Microsoft documentation, the cms file is a Service provider file that specify the configuration of the phone book and most of the other functions of your service profiles. Most advanced customization for a service profile is done by editing the .cms file for that service profile.\nI couldn't find any Linux or Ubuntu documentation about cms files specifically, I couldn't even find any Microsoft documentation about what the format should contain. Looking at it though, it does appear as if it contains a bunch of options which match up to the advanced options in the network manager vpn creation dialog.\nI couldn't match all of them, I don't know what connection type is.

Only the CardScan 600c and 800c devices have support from this sane driver.\nIt's possible to force the cardscan driver to attempt to work with your device by adding the usb ids to the cardscan.conf file and making sure the same ids are added to a udev rule similar to those found in 40-libsane.rules. But all of this work might just show that the device doesn't work anyway.\nYou need to get in touch with the cardScan manufacturers and ask them to release drivers if possible and documentation if not. We need to know how these devices work and what the protocols are. Otherwise it's going to be expensive to recreate the drivers from scratch.\n", "Q: VMWare and Ubuntu?  would a vm workstation running a client of Windows XP or Windows 7 run faster in Ubuntu than on a Windows 7 pc? \n\nA: This very much depends on your hardware.

I would like to put the top panel in the left. It would became a more beautiful thing if I could change the \"Application\", \"Places\" and \"System\" menus texts by 3 icons. Is it possible? How?\n\nA: No, that's not possible.\nAs an alternative, you can right click the panel, select \"Add to Panel\" and choose \"Main Menu\" to get a single icon, containing the Applications menu as well as places and system:\n\n\nA: It is possible to change those labels to icons. You would need to make small adaptations to the source code, recompile the gnome-panel package and finally install.\nThe source code for gnome-panel, with the modifications for Ubuntu, is found at http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/gnome-panel/master/view/head:/gnome-panel/panel-menu-bar.c\nAll Applications, Places and System are GtkWidget objects, which you can add an icon instead of the label.\nSo, the steps are\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the gnome-panel source for your Ubuntu version with apt-get source gnome-panel.\n\n*Make your modifications. Here it needs programming. You can find small tutorials on how to add icons to the menu item, compile them and learn how it is done. The code to gnome-panel should be about 6-12 lines of code.\n\n*See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/HandsOn on how to compile. In a nutshell you enter the gnome-panel directory that was created with apt-get source gnome-panel and then run dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b. Several .deb packages will be created that you can install with dpkg -i *.deb.\n\n*Finally, logout and log in again to see your changes.\n\n\nPerform the above steps first by changing the label 'Applications' to something like 'MyApplications;-)' so that you can see this process works for you.\nYou can return back to the original Ubuntu packages by performing a system update. Quite painless. Good luck!\n", "Q: Installing gdm on headless Server Edition I have Ubuntu Server running on a headless box, which is right now, almost entirely doing only software RAID and feels a little underused. I'd like to get into using Ubuntu as a desktop a little more. What do I need to do (install/etc.) to get Gnome while keeping the box itself headless? I'm not sure which packages to install or which steps to take. I figure I'll just use X over the network (Xming or the like) but something like NX might work.\n\nA: For an NX-based solution, I would suggest using X2go. It's not compatible with Nomachines client or OpenNX, but it is much better integrated with things like PulseAudio. This means that you can have two-way audio with the remote desktop, for instance. They have several nice clients, including a Firefox plugin. Like other NX-based solutions, it runs over ssh. \nIn order to do that, I would just install the ubuntu-desktop package, then install x2go. If you don't already have openssh-server installed, you'll need that one too, but if it's a headless server, I guess you already have that. You don't say which version of Ubuntu you're using, but if it's 11.10, then you'll probably want to test Unity 2D. The X2go client might need to be configured for that. It's likely that you'd also want to disable LightDM or GDM as it'd serve no purpose on a headless server. The easiest way to do that might be to simply uninstall it. \nThere are also other desktop environments you might want to try. LXDE is really fast and quite suitable for a terminal server. So if Xfce. \n\nA: I believe that you should just be able to run sudo apt-get install gdm, and it will install the GNOME Display Manager and all of the dependencies, which include the other necessary parts of the GNOME Desktop.\n", "Q: How well does a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 6370 graphics card work?

I have a netbook with a N450 Atom and a BCM70012 aka Crystal HD card. On Windows 7 I can play HD flash video with very little CPU usage because of the RC of Flash 10.2. I did some reading and saw posts claiming that the Crystal HD card is finally supported by the newer Flash 10.2 RC in Ubuntu but I can't get it to work. \nI can confirm that flash 10.2 is loaded and used, and there's even a HW acceleration option that is enabled in the settings but performance is horrible.

I remember reading a long time ago how you can rip the audio (music) from a DVD and convert it to a usable/readable format.\nI can't find that article any more. Can anybody help me?\n\nA: *\n\n*Inspect DVD with following command\npg@pipoTower: ~$ tcprobe -i /dev/sr0\n\nlook for line where chapters is like following:\n[dvd_reader.c] DVD title 1/1: 17 chapter(s), 1 angle(s), title set 1\n\n\n*Rip all titles to mp3 where for example {1..17} is the number of chapters of your dvd\nfor i in {1..17};do \n  transcode -x null,dvd -y null,tcaud -i /dev/sr0 -T 1,$i,1 -a 0 -E 44100,16,2 --lame_preset medium -m ~/tmp/yourDestinationMp3File_chapter${i}.mp3;\ndone\n\nFor details of command: \n\n\n*\n\n*-T title,chapter,angle (described by your tcprobe command in point 1.)\n\n*-a audioTrackNumber \n\n*-i inputDevice\n\n*--lampe_preset can be: medium, standard, extreme refer to man transcode for further details\n\n\n\nA: Here's what you're looking for: Handbrake.\nIt's a fairly useful tool for what you're trying to do. To install, add the ppa ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases to your software sources (here's how to do that) and install handbrake from the Software Center.\n\nA: For a proper Ubuntu approach I'd suggest to have a look into ffmpeg (command line). Example:\nffmpeg -i infile.wmv -vn -acodec copy outfile.wma\n\nOr, if you want an MP3 file:\nffmpeg -i infile.avi -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 -ab 192 -f mp3 outfile.mp3\n\nAlso there is another PPA software called Gnac; it's a GNOME software that uses the Gstreamer media framework and has a GUI.\nLaunchpad PPA: https://launchpad.net/~gnac-team/+archive/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnac-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnac\n\n\nA: Use VLC's \"open media\" menu option to open the DVD, set the title to the one you want (you may have to explore the DVD by actually starting to view it, to get the title number).\nThen instead of telling VLC to play it, tell it to stream it to a file.\nWorks great - you may have to use audacity to trim the results, as VLC will go back to the menu after playing the title you selected... so you'll get the menu track on infinite repeat at the end of your file :)\n\nA: Building on this answer and this post, I came with a similar solution for extracting uncompressed WAV files. Use tcprobe -i /dev/sr0 or lsdvd to determine the DVD title with the chapters of interest, then (assuming 17 chapters in title 1): \nfor i in {1..17};do \n  transcode -i /dev/sr0 -x dvd -T 1,$i,1 -a 0 -y wav -m /tmp/track${i}.wav\ndone\n\nIn my case this results in WAV files containing lpcm 16bit 48kHz 2Ch, same as the tracks on the DVD. You can check the resulting files using mediainfo. \n\nA: sudo apt-get install abcde\nabcde\n\nWait half an hour.

AcidRIP is small and efficient, and allows me to transcode my DVDs just one button click. \n\nA: Since transcode is not available as a package anymore in recent Ubuntu releases, some older answers don't work anymore. Here's an alternative solution using mplayer and ffmpeg:\nFirst, make sure to install mplayer and ffmpeg:\nsudo apt install mplayer ffmpeg\n\nThen, dump the DVD's content using mplayer:\nmplayer dvd:// -dumpstream -dumpfile output.vob\n\nNow, rip convert it to an audio file using ffmpeg (which will also omit the video content):\nffmpeg -i output.vob -vn -f mp3 output.mp3\n\nIf your DVD has multiple chapters and you want to keep this structure, start by checking the chapters using mplayer:\nmplayer -identify dvd://\n\nThen, dump each chapter (in this example, chapter 1 - 5):\nfor i in {1..5}; do \n   mplayer dvd:// -chapter $i-$i -dumpstream -dumpfile $i.vob; \ndone\n\nNow, convert all of them again\nfor i in *.vob; do \n   ffmpeg -i $i -vn -f mp3 ${i/vob/mp3}; \ndone\n\n", "Q: How can I make sure an environment variable is set when I sudo? How can I make sure an environment variable (GRAILS_HOME for example) is set when I sudo?\nI put a script in my /etc/profile.d with this value and made it ugo+x.  What do I need to do to make this visible to the super user?\n\nA: Try with \nsudo su -\n\nThe - loads up all the environment files. From man su:\n-, -l, --login\n   Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had\n   the user logged in directly.\n\n   When - is used, it must be specified as the last su option.

This means that login-specific resource files\n           such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell.  If a\n           command is specified, it is passed to the shell for\n           execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.\n           sudo attempts to change to that user's home directory\n           before running the shell.  It also initializes the\n           environment, leaving DISPLAY and TERM unchanged, setting\n           HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, and PATH, as well as the\n           contents of /etc/environment on Linux and AIX systems.  All\n           other environment variables are removed.\n\n\nA: Per this answer: Setting the PATH so it applies to all users, including root/sudo  if you note Sudo resets all variables and path by default.  \nPertinent Bit:\nThe manual page for sudoers states:\n\nenv_reset       If set, sudo will reset the environment to only contain\n                   the LOGNAME, MAIL, SHELL, USER, USERNAME and the SUDO_*\n                   variables.  Any variables in the caller's environment\n                   that match the env_keep and env_check lists are then\n                   added.

If the secure_path option is set,\n                   its value will be used for the PATH environment\n                   variable.  This flag is on by default.\n\n\nSo, you can do the following to maintain variables when using sudo\nsudo visudo\n\nthis will open sudo settings for you.

I'd like to use the run-app command with the port set to port 80 (firewall, etc), however whenever I do I get the following exception:\n\nServer failed to start: LifecycleException:  Protocol handler initialization failed: java.net.BindException: Permission denied:80\n\nHow do I change my configuration so I can bind to port 80?\n\nA: As João Pinto notes, ordinarily only root can bind to privileged ports (1-1023). It's probably more common in cases like this to set up some kind of reverse proxy server (apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc.) to listen on port 80 and send requests back to the grails app running on a higher port.\n", "Q: How to track Firefox beta via a PPA, but not Thunderbird daily builds etc? I would like to install the beta of Firefox 4 in lucid or maverick.  I know I can install the ubuntu-mozilla-daily PPA (ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa) and have easy apt-get access to firefox-4.0.  However, this repository contains not only Firefox, but also daily builds of Thunderbird and other mozilla products.  \nIf I leave this PPA enabled, apt-get upgrade also upgrades Thunderbird 3 to the latest \"shredder\".  I'm not interested in running a daily build of Thunderbird -- I just want Firefox 4.\nIs there some combination of pinning, backporting, or something like that which would make it easy for me to run an up-to-date daily of Firefox 4, but only Firefox 4?\n\nA: If you just want the beta, I suggest ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next which has the latest beta, but not the latest nightly.\nIf you want the latest nightly, you could set up a cron job that pulls the latest nightly from nightly.mozilla.org and installs it in /usr/local.

I have a Compaq Presario CQ-61 320SQ, I am using Ubuntu 10.04 because after update to 10.10 my mouse and touchpad won't work, network won't work, sound won't work ... (I managed to fix most of them after almost a month of googling, but not all, my 2 Desktops have no problem with 10.10) so I decided to switch back to 10.04, where I have a problem:\nMy broadband speed is very low beacause of the kernel module r8169, I downloaded the good module r8101 and every time the computer boots have a rc.local entry to fix this.   \nQuestion:\nCan I load the modul permanently from a specific location.

When I installed Ubuntu on my desktop, everything seemed to \"just work\" -- I used the proprietary ATI graphics card for my ATI Radeon HD 5870 and everything from Compiz to video to Amagetron Advanced worked perfectly fine.\nThen I tried Minecraft. It crashes when rendering the levels, and Googling the error message shows it to be a common issue with (well, bug in) the proprietary ATI drivers. So, I tried disabling them -- and my entire desktop started flickering, Compiz exploded, and basically it was just Not Good.\nI spent about $100 on this graphics card (last year), so I'd prefer to not pay for a new one if possible. On IRC, I've been told that \"ATI sucks with Linux, your fault for buying a shitty card\" and similar. I was hoping that Linux (especially Ubuntu) had gotten over the driver-hell as it had for the rest of my system -- is there a working, open-source ATI driver being developed?\n\nA: Generally speaking the open source driver doesn't work well when Compiz is enabled and a graphically intensive game is run.  Minecraft might not look to pretty, but a lot is happening under the hood.  The best advice I've seen is to turn off Compiz when running games.\nAs to developing a better open source driver, video cards are in an awkward position because the proprirtary drivers work well enough for most people, hence there isn't a significant push to improve the open source versions.  That said, the ATI open source driver folks are still releasing new drivers regularly.\nIf you are willing to live on the cutting (or bleeding, as case may be) edge, you can try the xorg-edgers PPA, it is supposed to work better in some cases.\n\nA: The ubuntu wiki for the open source radeon driver indicates that it supports 3D acceleration for your card.  My experience with recent versions of the radeon driver has been that it's slower but more stable than fglrx.\nUnfortunately, replacing fglrx with the open source driver is a bit of a hassle. From here:\n# remove fglrx packages\nsudo /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh  # (if it exists)\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx* \n\n# remove and reinstall the open source driver\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon  \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati\n\n# replace lingering proprietary libraries with the open-source versions\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and i think to use Wine. It works but not at first time. I set the minectaft launcher to win XP configuration. It did not work. So I got angry and Choose Minecraft.exe and hold enter about 20s ens it starts many prosess and one of them START!\n", "Q: Why am I doing badly on the html5 test? The version of Firefox in the 10.10 repos seems to perform pretty poorly on the HTML5 test. Why is this? Is there something I can do about that?

No it doesn’t matter a whole lot, html5 is still in the development stages. \n", "Q: Assign programs permanently to different sound-outputs in Pulseaudio? I want to assign Skype input and output to my USB-headset while the rest of my laptop uses the internal sound-card. This is an easy task with PulseAudio Volume control (pavucontrol). The only problem I have is every time a call is made I manually have to set the output and input for Skype to my USB-device . \nWhen I hang up, Skype disappears from Volume Control. It reappears again with the next call only this time the default sound-card is selected again. It shouldn’t be hard to let PulseAudio look or the USB-headset is connected when Skype audio comes is before selecting the default. The way to do it is obvious not through Volume Control.\n\nA: https://launchpad.net/earcandy\nhttps://launchpad.net/~earcandy-devel/+archive/ppa\nIts not complete but it allows you to push sound to headset..\nbtw pulse audio will not be doing this by default, the developers do not agree that sound should move devices in this way.\nI should add to any one who knows a little python, help would be gratefully accepted to finish this app off..\n\nA: I’m confused. All of a sudden pavucontrol does remember my settings.Now when I plugin my USB headset Skype automatically gets routed to the headset and Rhythmbox gets routed to my Bluetooth receiver. So when I decided to give up on it, it fixed itself… \n\nA: This is not the whole answer because I have little knowledge about audio redirection. \nIn \"skype > options > notifications\" you can set for a script to be executed upon receiving a call. Unfortunately pavucontrol does not accept command-line input. but perhaps alsamixer can be used to redirect audio.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Share Files over the Network - What packages?

We have a few Windows(XP & 7) and Ubuntu machines in the house sharing a wireless connection, and want to share music between them.   If possible, I would like to be able to serve music from both Windows and Ubuntu (but it doesn't have to be the same time).\nI don't know much about sharing folders or streaming, but I'm guessing both would be options (that is, using a local client to access a shared song or a local client to access a shared stream).   I want to be able to share the music between the systems as simply as possible.  \nBonus points (but not requirements) for   \n\n\n*\n\n*cross-platform  -- same application on both Windows and Ubuntu?\n\n*available on startup (via daemon or autostart or whatnot)\n\n*open source\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*All systems have dynamic addresses (DHCP) supplied from the ISP-supplied wireless router.\n\n*There are several Gigabytes of music on one Windows XP box and one Ubuntu 10.10 \n\n*The music is not well-sorted (I'm thinking this might have an impact on UI usability).\n\n*Only has to be available internally (private address space behind the wireless router)\n\n*bandwidth is not a problem\n\n*We don't have (legitimate) admin access to the wireless router\n\n\nA: What comes to my mind first is to use UPnP media file sharing between your machines. You will need a UPnP server on the machine that stores the files and a UPnP client to play the contents.\nUPnP server/client technology is well established in Windows Media Player and allows media sharing over the network. If you are looking for a cross-platform solution there is e.g. VLC player or XBMC that can be installed on both, Windows and Ubuntu. However by using the UPnP protocol you can also run a different software on each machine (e.g. Media Player for Windows and VLC for Ubuntu). \nTo provide a UPnP server only to share media folders there is an easy to handle command line tool in Ubuntu: uShare.\nIf you rather like to send audio live streams simultaneously to all connected machines in your LAN you may want to have a look at Icecast available for both, Ubuntu and for Windows. This enables you to stream music using an internet radio protocol (but in your case  streamed to local machines only - including so called \"Internet Radios\").\nIn any case you'll need enough LAN capacity for audio files to be streamed without congestion.\n\nA: I just use a samba share.  For linux I also export it as an NFS share, although it is mountable using SMB.  I already share directories using both.\n\nA: Rhythmbox has a built-in plugin for DAAP, which is supported by Songbird. Songbird is available for both Mac and Windows.\nIf you have your music in Rhythmbox already, I'd recommend checking it out!\n\nA: Does the router support UPnP? A DAAP server like Tangerine might be the quickest bet to sharing your Ubuntu music with Windows. There are other options but Tangerine does make things very simple.\nAnd then you'd just do the same on the Windows machine: Install a DAAP server (or use a client that has one - iTunes does not count as they encrypt their DAAP). This is a little harder for me as I'm not a Windows user (more than running a few apps in VirtualBox once a week) but FireFly should work. It looks a little more effortsome than Tangerine but there you go.\nWith both computers running DAAP servers each can run whatever music software and as long as it supports DAAP (most do these days), you should be able to see what's available on the other machine.\nBoth RhythmBox and Banshee will play DAAP shares on Ubuntu.\n\nA: TwonkyServer (Not Free)\nTwonkyServer for Windows®, Windows Home Server, Linux, and Mac®.\nI have it running on a Linux Hacked Linksys NSLU2 and it works great. There is a try it for 30 days trial period.\n\nA: ps3mediaserver is available for Windows and Linux:\n\nPS3 Media Server is a DLNA compliant Upnp Media Server for the PS3, written in Java, with the purpose of streaming or transcoding any kind of media files, with minimum configuration.\n\nI used it some time ago, and it was very easy.\n\nA: What about Tonido? It is not limited to the same network, is cross-platform, uses the internet browser to display shared files. Tonido has to be installed and running on the computer that shares the music. To share, create an account with an e-mail address, get a password and enter it when starting Tonido and when the internet browser opens.\nThen you'll see your computer files and will be able to select the folders you want with a link.\n\nSending a link that shares an entire music collection would be the best idea. And then, saving that link (maybe as a desktop shortcut or as a bookmark in the internet browser) on the computer where you want to play the music. \nYou will be able to play the music in the Tonido's player. It can play MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4A, M4B, WAV (according to their page; more info there.) \n\n\n", "Q: How do I get long command lines to wrap to the next line? Something I have noticed in Ubuntu for a long time that has been frustrating to me is when I am typing a command at the command line that gets longer (wider) than the terminal width, instead of wrapping to a new line, it goes back to column 1 on the same line and starts over-writing the beginning of my command line. (It doesn't actually overwrite the actual command, but visually, it is overwriting the text that was displayed).\nIt's hard to explain without seeing it, but let's say my terminal was 20 characters wide (Mine is more like 120 characters - but for the sake of an example), and I want to echo the English alphabet.  What I type is this:\necho abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nBut what my terminal looks like before I hit the  key is:\npqrstuvwxyzghijklmno\n\nWhen I hit enter, it echos\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nso I know the command was received properly.  It just wrapped my typing after the \"o\" and started over on the same line.  \nWhat I would expect to happen, if I typed this command in on a terminal that was only 20 characters wide would be this:\necho abcdefghijklmno\npqrstuvwxyz\n\nBackground: I am using bash as my shell, and I have this line in my ~/.bashrc:\nset -o vi\n\nto be able to navigate the command line with VI commands.  I am currently using Ubuntu 10.10 server, and connecting to the server with Putty.\nIn any other environment I have worked in, if I type a long command line, it will add a new line underneath the line I am working on when my command gets longer than the terminal width and when I keep typing I can see my command on 2 different lines.  But for as long as I can remember using Ubuntu, my long commands only occupy 1 line.\nThis also happens when I am going back to previous commands in the history (I hit Esc, then 'K' to go back to previous commands) - when I get to a previous command that was longer than the terminal width, the command line gets mangled and I cannot tell where I am at in the command.\nThe only work-around I have found to see the entire long command is to hit \"Esc-V\", which opens up the current command in a VI editor.\nI don't think I have anything odd in my .bashrc file.  I commented out the \"set -o vi\" line, and I still had the problem.\nI downloaded a fresh copy of Putty and didn't make any changes to the configuration - I just typed in my host name to connect, and I still have the problem, so I don't think it's anything with Putty (unless I need to make some config changes)\nHas anyone else had this problem, and can anyone think of how to fix it?\nEdit\nIt was my .bashrc file.  I've copied the same profile from machine to machine, and I used special characters in my $PS1 that are somehow throwing it off.  I'm now sticking with the standard bash variables for my $PS1.\nThanks to @ændrük for the tip on the .bashrc!\n...End Edit...\n\nA: I guess you have configured your PS1 with colors, right?\nJust make sure you have \\[ inside your PS1 quote preceding your color set\nFor example:\nPS1='\\[\\e[0;32m\\u@\\w/:\\[\\e[m '\n\n\nA: A simple thing to do would be to add the following line before setting the PS1:\nstty columns 1000\n\nFor example,\nstty columns 1000\nPS1='\\[\\e[0;32m\\u@\\w/:[\\e[m '\n\nhowever this does affect other unix commands like ls and man.\n\nA: I had the same issue with a custom coloured prompt, even though I contained colour codes within \\[ and \\] delimiters. It turns out that bash has problems echoing colours from inside a function. I ended up just using variables for my prompt, and though my .bashrc is a little less elegant, everything works nicely now.\n\nA: Make sure all non-printable bytes in your PS1 are contained within \\[ \\]. Otherwise, bash will count them in the length of the prompt. It uses the length of the prompt to determine when to wrap the line.\nFor example, here bash counts the prompt as 19 columns wide, while the prompt displayed by the terminal is only 10 columns wide (My prompt written in cyan, and > written in default color):\nPS1='\\e[36mMy prompt\\e[0m>'         # bash count: 19, actual: 10\n\nwhile here it only counts the prompt as 10 columns wide because it ignores the bytes between the special \\[ and \\] escapes:\nPS1='\\[\\e[36m\\]My prompt\\[\\e[0m\\]>' # bash count: 10, actual: 10\n\nFor good practice though, use tput to generate the terminal escapes rather than hard coding them:\ncyan=$(tput setaf 6) # \\e[36m\nreset=$(tput sgr0)   # \\e[0m\nPS1='\\[$cyan\\]My prompt\\[$reset\\]>'\n\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/053, and also http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes for more on tput.\n\nA: I had a similar issue, and finally found a simple solution.\nAdd following line in your .bashrc file:\nCOLUMNS=250\n\nThen type source ~/.bashrc to get the desired effect.\n\nA: I had this problem when connected in tmux. The problem was that I had an ipython session in the background (ctrl + z) and that somehow broke line wrapping. As soon as I terminated it (fg, ctrl+d+d) my terminal started working properly\nSo check for any stopped interactive prompts.\n\nA: So I just had the same issue with a slight twist on it and I thought I would share my solution too, just to add my little nuance :D\nMy initial PS1 was\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$\"\n\nThe problem I had was that I was trying to change my terminal title as well as the command prompt. The way I did this was by adding \\[\\033]0;\\]Title\\a to the PS1 variable.\nSo now my PS1 was:\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$\\[\\033]0;\\]Title\\a\"\n\nThis messed up the line wrapping for me. I finally figured out that bash doesn't seem to like having \\a at the end. To circumvent this, I put the title in a variable, which seemed to fix it.\nTITLE=\"\\033]0;Title\\a\"\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$\\[$TITLE\\]\"\n\n\nA: \\[ and \\] didn't work for me. I guess there was something different about how I was generating the prompt (from an external program), or because my prompt was \"dynamic\".\nAfter reading this I found that you can actually escape the color codes with the 0x01 and 0x02 bytes.\ne.g. I'm using a special version of Chalk and I wrap the colors using this:\nconst Chalk = require('@nasc/chalk');\n\nconst chalk = new Chalk.constructor({\n  wrapper: {\n    pre: '\\1',\n    post: '\\2',\n  }\n});\n\n", "Q: Is Nautilus reporting wrong free space? \nI have 87.2 GB left as shown by PCMANFM, but Nautilus shows only 81.3 GB, why is that, i've been using SHIFT+DEL to remove files so, i don't know why is this happening.\n\nA: By the looks of it, Nautilus is reporting GiB ( = 1 073 741 824 bytes) and PCMANFM is reporting GB ( = 10^9 bytes).\nIn other words:\n81.3 GiB = 81.3 * 1 073 741 824 bytes = 87.2952103 × 10^9 bytes = 87.2 GB\n", "Q: How can I switch on Flight Mode?

I have Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid installed through wubi on my laptop (it came with Windows 7 preinstalled).  This was my first foray into Linux, and I'm here to stay.  I have no use for Windows, and yet I must manually choose not to boot into it!\nShould I shrink the Windows partition to something negligible and grow the Linux one using something like gparted or fdisk, and just be content that everything runs?  In that case, I need to understand the filesystems.

Certainly, I will backup my home directory tree (gzip?), but what about various pieces of software that I've acquired from the repositories?  Can I keep a record of them?\nBy the way, I asked a similar question over on Ubuntu forums.\n\nA: The WUBI \"disk\" is actually just a file that lives in Windows' own filesystem. As a result there's no nice way to migrate to the real thing. That said, if you're feeling adventurous, here's what I would do:\nIf you have an external hard disk, you make life much easier for yourself. Just boot into WUBI-Ubuntu, run sudo rsync -ax ~ /media/external-disk/homebackup/. If you have anything else you dearly want to keep, move it over (use the -a flag with cp and rsync and they will preserve file metadata).\nThen do a normal \"wipe everything\" install from a LiveCD or LiveUSB. Before you reboot after the install, mount the installation disk and run the opposite commands (eg: sudo rsync -ax /media/external-disk/homebackup/ /media/3423423-234234-234/home/username). \nAll you have to do then is reboot into real Ubuntu and get all your old applications installed (your old config for each should be safe).\nFailing the presence of an external disk, you can do the move incrementally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a real LiveCD or LiveUSB going and boot into it.\n\n*In gparted: Resize the Windows partition right down (so there's at least 8GB+your WUBI disk's size of free space). You should probably move the Windows partition to the far right of the disk so the free space is now at the beginning.\n\n*Run the installer and tell it to install to use the free space. Do not reboot once finished.\n\n*Mount the NTFS drive and look in ubuntu/disks/ for .disk files. Mount those and copy over your home (per my previous instructions).\n\n*You can then delete the NTFS drive (assuming you don't need anything from Windows) and resize the Ubuntu partitions in gparted.\n\n\nA: I found the solution on Ubuntu Forums, where user bcbc has provided a script to migrate away from a wubi install and was available to answer many questions.\n\nA: I'm not 100% on this, but I'm pretty sure Wubi doesn't make a real partition. Your disk seems to contain one partition (Windows) and a \"fake\" partition of Ubuntu.\nI found this on the Ubuntu wiki regarding turning a Wubi install into a normal one.\nKeep in mind, if backing up all your files isn't a problem, wiping the disk with a clean Ubuntu install would probably be easiest.\n\nA: Just in case somebody gets here before getting to the Ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi\n", "Q: HDTV resolution issue Fresh ubuntu install, Nvidia drivers for 9600GTOC hooked up to a 26\" Polaroid  HDTV Via DVI - HDMI cable.

I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 - the Maverick Meerkat. Whenever I install software using the Software Center, it installs it to /usr/lib. I have less space in this drive. Is it possible to change the default installation path to any other place? And how?\n\nA: Debian/Ubuntu uses a standard directory hierarchy.  The command man hier will describe this for you.  It is common for packages to create symlinks to place files in the correct place when the program expects them elsewhere.\nThere are two options I use to increase space on a partition:\n\n*\n\n*As a temporary solution I create a directory on another partition for a directory like /var/cache/apt/archives which can take a fair amount of space.  I then move the contents of the directory to the new partition and replace the directory with a symlink.\n\n*A permanent solution is to create a new partition for a large moveable directory like home, var or usr.  Then I rsync the directory onto the new partition and mount it.  Cleanup is done by mounting the root partition on /mnt and removing the files from the directory under /mnt.\n\nCleaning up /tmp and moving it to a tmpfs mount can free up space if it is on disk.\nYou may also free up space with the apt autoclean or apt clean commands.  The second option will remove all download debs for /var/cache/apt/archives.\nRunning apt and removing obsolete kernels may also free up space.  Usually, two are sufficient, and they don't always get removed automatically.  Don't remove the current kernel.  If you haven't rebooted for a long time you may want to reboot to the newest kernel before removing old kernels.\nThe command du -sk /usr /home /var | sort -n will tell you how large those directory trees are.\n\nA: There is no facility to change the installation structure. They are hard-coded in the installation packages. What you can do is find a way to increase the size of your root partition. You can do this if you boot with your Ubuntu installation CD.\nIf you can provide the output of the command\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nwe might be able to help on how to resize.\n\nA: The installation path is a standard location and cannot be changed.  If you have another drive that has space, you can move any amount of your files to that drive by mounting your big directories at partitions on that drive  (this is easiest to do when you are first installing Ubuntu).   It's usually a good idea to move your /home directory to a different partition/drive rather than trying to move your OS files.\nDetailed instructions can be found here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\n", "Q: How do I get a Canon PIXMA ip1900 to work?

How do I get this printer to work? I need it for business!\n\nA: I managed to recreate the packages on my 32bit Ubuntu install, I couldn't test them on 64bit, but I did show that it's possible to build them for 64bit:\nDownload this file: http://files.canon-europe.com/files/soft31335/software/iP1900_debian_printer.tar (7.7MB)\nUnpack it on your desktop and grab the cnijfilter-common-3.00-1.tar.gz file (ignore the deb files), extract this archive and you should get a cnijfilter-common-3.00 folder.

I know this is more of a general linux question but w/e. So when I enter a program like vim in the command prompt it displays all the text in the file and I can edit it etc. But I can't figure out how to close or save the file and get back to the command prompt without killing the process. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: In vim there are 3 different modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert - allows typing and editing as normal\n\n*Visual - used for selecting copy/paste etc.\n\n*Normal - used for commands\n\n\nTo get back to Normal mode, you can always press esc.\nOnce you are at Normal mode Press : to begin your command (you'll see it appear in the bottom left).  The following commands are related to quiting vim:\n\n\n*\n\n*:q - quit if no changes were made\n\n*:q! - quit and destroy any changes made\n\n*:wq - write changes (save) and quit\n\n*:x - similar to :wq, only write the file if changes were made, then quit\n\n\nA: Much to our inconvenience, there is no general method for exiting command-line programs like there is the \"X\" button for graphical programs.\nMany command-line programs follow the theme of using either Q (e.g. man and top) or Ctrl+C (e.g. ping and watch) to exit, but this varies considerably, especially among text editors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vim in particular uses the obscure combination of :q! then Enter, usually preceded by several presses of Esc for good measure.\n\n*Emacs, another gem, prefers Ctrl+X followed by Ctrl+C.\n\n\nEditors like this are traps for the inexperienced. My personal preference and recommendation is to, when forced to edit text on the command-line, use instead the more self-explanatory Joe's Own Editor (JOE).\n\nA: Alongside jondavidjohn's answer, here are two links that have indispensable information about using vim.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a keyboard graphic that shows you what each key does depending on if you're in edit mode, command mode, or visual mode:\nhttp://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html\n\n*This is the best vim tutorial I've ever worked through. It's conversational and easy to understand, which is due to it's IRC/instant-messaging format.\nhttp://www.vi-improved.org/tutorial.php\nFinally, there are some like aendruk who simply don't want to use advanced command line text editors. Vim in particular has a steep learning curve, and does actually take some initial effort to get used to. But it's very fast, and very powerful. If you have interest in linux beyond basic desktop usage, it's worth investing time learning a decent command line text editor like Vim or Emacs. If you just need to edit some text and don't care much beyond that, try typing gedit filename.txt instead. It will launch a familiar graphical program, much like Notepad from Windows.\n\nA: if  Esc :q! does not work,\ntry first Ctrl+q (to unlock the screen which was locked with Ctrl+s)\nthen retry Esc :q! (to quit without saving) or Esc :wq (to save and quit)\n\nA: First, hit the escape key.1\nThen just type ZZ (that's two capital Z's in a row).\nOr, type :x . \nEither will save any edits and leave.\nYou can also use :wq\nAlternately, you can type :q  (a.k.a, \"quit, please\") This will exit only if you haven't made edits. \nIf you've made edits, and you want to discard them and leave, type :q! (a.k.a \"quit, damn it!\")    \n1 : This ensures you are in \"command\" mode.   Which you want for typing commands, like those needed to exit. \n\nA: Want exit without save:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit ESC\n\n*Hit ZQ\nExit with save:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit ESC\n\n*Hit ZZ\n", "Q: Can I make the global application menu show the full application title?

How can I check if it's a hardware problem? On my EEE PC netbook some colors are not displayed properly. Specifically, dark gradients such as in the window title do not look very smooth, but rather look like a sequence of a couple of different colors.\nThis is especially visible when opening a menu, for example the \"File\" menu in Firefox. As you know this one is black, and it looks terrible on my screen. It is not just black, but the colors look really graded and far from a smooth gradient or anything.\nNow I am wondering: Is this a hardware or software issue? And how can I check this?\nIf it should be a fixable problem I think it would be worth another question.\nNote that I am using Natty. If my problem description is not good enough I can try to take a photo.\n\nA: To check if the Netbook screen is at fault, you can try plugging it into an external monitor. If the colors appear fine on the monitor, you may have some screen issues.\nTo check your video card, I would try a different version of Ubuntu, for starters. You don't have to reinstall to test this out - unetbootin should let you boot into a live session, which will allow you to try one of the more stable versions, like 10.04. I run an EEE Netbook on that version, so I believe it should work. If it does look like there's a software issue with 11.04, please file a bug to help the developers out!\nAs many folks here have mentioned in the comments, it seems like this would (most likely) be an issue of color depth.

(Cuda/OpenCL related) I have a test suite that uses openCL and I notice that I pass more if I close down everything and just run the tests. I fail more if I have lots of programs open on my desktop. Is it possible to cap how much vram my displays are sucking up?\n\nA: Stop using a compositing window manager. They use the GPU for their special effects, which means that in addition to the framebuffer in VRAM, every window is backed by a texture in VRAM and shaders are used to render the desktop. If you use a simpler window manager with no fancy or 3d effects there should be less contention for your GPU resources.\n(Some compositing window managers can be run with compositing features disabled, so try that before you go shopping for an entirely new window manager.)\n", "Q: Remove unwanted Mount option from Places Menu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I hide CIFS volumes in the Places menu? \n\nOn Ubuntu 10.10, \nI added a CIFS network share into /etc/fstab using /media/pub as my mount point. \nThe share becomes visible on the Desktop and under Places (drive icon), which is what I want. But the problem is, Ubuntu 10.10 (unlike 10.04) creates another entry under Places with same name \"pub\", except this appears to be a mount shortcut rather than another link to the share. When I move my mouse over it says \"Mount pub\" and if I click on it, it will mount the share and again each time (if already mounted) - it does not display contents of share. In either case, an error pops up soon after \"Unable to mount pub - Timeout waiting for mount to appear\". \nThe share itself is accessible, but I can't unmount via GUI, system reports its mounted multiple times and I have to unmount via terminal sudo umount -a.\nAs I'm mounting the share at boot time, I don't need this manual option under Places. Is there an easy way to stop Ubuntu from listing it under Places?\nI have tried making the mount point under /mnt, this fixes the problem, except creates another as it removes the drive icon from Desktop and Places. I could create a bookmark, but just wondered if there's an easy fix to this unwanted entry under Places.\nThanks\n\nA: you must have using wrong mount command to auto mount the partition. I was facing the similar issue and resolved by using a small utility called : \"Storage Device manager\".\nYou can install it from \"Ubuntu Software Center\". Remove any mount option you have added in the /etc/fstab and use that utility to auto-mount the partitions.\nThis will Definitely resolve your problem...\n", "Q: Distribution upgrade freezes When upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 the distribution upgrade program freezes after it notifies me of a change in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.mysqld and asks me to keep the old file or accept the new changes (I accepted them).\nThe terminal says:\nConfiguration file `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?

So any ideas?\n\nA: For GRUB the command to check what version you have is:\ngrub-install -V\n\nor\ngrub-install --version\n\nMore to find here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: Use the dd command to read the boot sector, then use grep to know your bootloader:\ndd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 2>&1 | grep GRUB\ndd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 2>&1 | grep LILO\n\n\nA: If you have the /etc/lilo.conf file then you are using LILO (LInux LOader)\nThis means that if you type lilo for example you should see the command dialog for the lilo booter.\nIf you have the /boot/grub/ directory then you are using GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)\nThis means that you should be able to use all the grub file like grub-install,grub-reboot...\nUbuntu 9.10 was the first version to use GRUB2 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Grub\nUPDATE:\nHere is a script to check inside the first sector of the hard drive for what boot manager it is using:\nAssuming your hard drive is at SDA then:  \nsudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 2>/dev/null | strings | grep -Eoi 'grub|lilo|acronis|reboot'\n\nwill tell you which bootloader you are using.\nYou can imagine the rest...\nThe list of boot loaders is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_boot_loaders  and http://wiki.debian.org/BootLoader (For Debian based distros)\nAlso if you want to SEE the real binary output then add -a to the grep part. For example:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 2>&1 | grep -a GRUB which will show you the data in that first block.\nNow with this new information you HAVE to find the boot manager you are using.\n\nA: The boot info script will detect all kinds of useful information about your boot configuration:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/\n\nA: You are safer checking by inquiring the version from the tools itself (than using low-level dd or other artifacts).\nFor example, testing for lilo:\nroot# lilo -V\nbash: lilo: command not found\n\nroot# grub-install --version\ngrub-install (GRUB) 2.02~beta2-22\n\nOf course, this will not work if you have both installed.

It makes me crazy.\nIs there an easy way to delete a file in Rhythmbox play queue.  \n\nA: You can not. From the play queue you can only remove the file from the queue since it is a temporary list of the songs you have chosen to listen. The real list of songs is in the Music Option\nin this picture you see the Music section to the left. In the list below is where you can delete files. Right click on them and Move to trash for example. That will remove it. But to not have from the queue and remove you need to remove it from Queue and the delete like i said from the Music section.\n\nA: By the way you ask your question, can I assume that the song you want to remove is the one currently playing?

If that also fails, select the 'Recovery Console' option.   This will launch just single (xterm) terminal session without Gnome.  If that's necessary, view the contents of the .xsession-errors file.  It should give you a more specific reason for the failure. \nYou might make sure your filesystem has free space -- use df -h . Depending on your partition scheme, you should at least have room on your / filesystem. \nIf you do get a command line and it's still not obvious what the problem is, you might start with running sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-power-manager from the command line.\n", "Q: Recover personal PGP key from old home Many lives ago, I created a GPG key to sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct on Launchpad. I haven't really used it since. Some time later, I backed up my home and started fresh.\nThat was all back in 2009. I still have the backup but now I'm starting to play around with  Quickly and upload things to Launchpad, I could really do with having my PGP key back.\nI don't really know how the key is organised or where it's stored, but I'd like to recover my old key rather than generate a new one. Any idea where to start?\n\nA: Navigate to the ./gnupg of your old home directory\nthen\ngpg --import pubring.gpg\ngpg --import secring.gpg\n\nimport anything else in there you might need.\n\nA: If you have your whole old home directory backed up, all you need to do is copy the old ~/.gnupg/ folder to your new home.\nThough it should be noted that this isn't really the best way to back up and restore a key. It has the draw back of over-writing the gpg keyrings on the target system. If you've imported public keys or created new keys, this isn't the ideal solution.\nTypically, you should save your public and private keys using:\ngpg -ao mypub.key --export <MY_KEY_ID>\ngpg -ao myprivate.key --export-secret-keys <MY_KEY_ID>\n\nThen import them on the new system with:\ngpg --import myprivate.key\ngpg --import mypub.key\n\nThis way they are just added to the keyring on the target system.\n\nA: I had the same issue. \nAnd I solved it without losing my newly generated keys by moving .key files from old to new ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d folder and restarting gnupg.\nThis only works with GnuPG 2.1 or above.\n", "Q: Gnome keyring doesn't unlock after loging in using Pam-face-authentication I am using http://pam-face-authentication.org/ to log into my system using face detection and it is working just great except for one thing,The authentication runs out of the box, but it doesn't unlock my keyring.\nSo after loging into my system, I see my desktop and everything normally but then a password prompt pops-up asking for Gnome-keyring, I think if it can log me into the system just fine then it should also be able to unlock the gnome-kerying.\nThis guy also have the same issue -->\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/gdm/+bug/479881/comments/4\n\nA: That is because your keyring is encrypted with your login password, and since you don't enter the password to log in, pam can not unlock your keyring automatically.  There may be a way to disable the keyring password, but I am not sure how.  Of course, this would mean that if your system is compromised, someone could read all of your passwords and keys stored in the keyring.\n\nA: You can set your keyring password to be an empty password... be aware your passwords will no longer be encrypted\nSystem -> Preferences -> Encryption and Keyrings\nRight click on \"Passwords : login\" and select change password\nEnter nothing in the new password boxs\n\nA: I've heard that some applications get a tad annoyed if there's no password on the default keyring, so instead you could use a script to unlock it with a password.

I have been trying to catch up with some of the old games from way back that are about right for my little Aspire One netbook through Wine.\nI've run into a problem Baldurs Gate, however, which is that I can't change CD.\nObviously, I don't have a CD drive, so I have copied the CD content onto an external hard drive and I'm using a mount command with the loopback option to persuade the game that the CD is present. This allowed installation to work correctly and works fine to run it and to play the content from the first CD. However, when the game asks for CD2, I'm stuck.\nIf I mount the CD2 ISO to the CD Rom path it doesn't appear to respond, whether or not I have first unmounted CD1.

It loads to 32% or something, then asks for iso # 2. Don't try to eject or unmount first iso, just use the same command to mount iso # 2. I think this creates a random drive letter and automatically maps the mount path in wine.\nMount iso # 2\n\nsudo mount -o loop AOMG_D2.iso ~/virtualdrive/Drive0\n\nYou should wait 5-10 seconds at this point, and it should continue the installation. If not, try pressing \"OK\" to the prompt about inserting next disc.\nI was actually QUITE surprised this worked.\n\nA: I can't test it right now, but I think you need to use the wine eject command (http://wiki.winehq.org/eject)\n\nA: There's a tutorial that covers this here:\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/Infinity_Engine_Games\nYou might try the solution at the bottom of the page first (\"AnotherAlternativeToInstall\"), as it seems to require fewer steps.\nThere are also specific things people did to install and run in the entries at winehq for Baldur's Gate.\n", "Q: No Grub after installing Ubuntu beside Windows 7 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I repair grub?

How can this be prevented?\nOr maybe this could be achieved: how I can remove tomboy and keep all other packages that come with gnome?\n\nA: There isn't any package named gnome. I think you meant ubuntu-desktop\nEither your system does not have proper packages list. Do a\nsudo apt-get update\nto check if everything is in order\nIf the problem still comes, check what all are contained in the package. Chances are high that it is a metapackage. It means that a package which has multiple packages as it's dependencies. \nMeta-packages don't contain anything. If you want to install say kubuntu on already existing ubuntu installation then all you need to do is to install kubuntu-desktop which will take care of the packages which need to be installed.\nNow if you remove any single of the package which are dependency of that meta-package, then that meta-package is shown to be removed. \nDon't worry, your whole gnome is not going to be removed. Only the meta-package is going to be unchecked as the dependency requirement for that package is not fulfilled.\nI am not very much sure what the problem you are getting. Probably the solution I explained might not be the solution to your problem, nevertheless I thought it is good to explain what all problems can exist with the same symptoms.\n\nA: If you want to remove Tomboy, APT also want to remove ubuntu-desktop. \nIt's safe to remove, because ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package.\n\nA: You were very close initially to removing tomboy notes.\nsimply add sudo before your command and that should work. \nI tested on my system and no more tomboy notes.\nsudo apt-get remove tomboy\n\n", "Q: No access points show in Wireless I know when I first installed the OS it said I needed to install additional drivers.

What is running on terminal 1-6 is getty, which allows users to login to a CLI. Terminal 7 is probably running something like tail -f /var/log/messages (it doesn't do that on my machine).\nThe configurations for these programs exists in /etc/init/tty[n].conf on ubuntu. You can put any command here, but remember that they will run as the root user. The virtual terminals after 6 (or 7 in your case) are free so that the X server will be able to bind to one, otherwise the program running in the background of the virtual terminal would be able to interfere with your graphical session.\nThe reason for having these different virtual terminals is not actually debugging, but it is a historical relic from the time of timesharing systems, where several users would use the same mainframe from different terminals. \nhttp://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php\n\nA: In former times the consoles where controlled in a file called /etc/inittab. Since upstart and the like I'm not so sure where to find those configurations, but you should know that it is purely made by configuration how many active consoles you have, and on which of them what is displayed. \nThere have been some conventions about them. I know of tty{1..6} for normal usage (login, getty), tty7 for X11, tty8 or 10 for loginfos.

When upgrading my hardware, I also upgraded to Ubuntu 10.10. On my previous system (with 10.04 and earlier). when I ejected a disk from the optical drive, the sub-folder in the /media directory was automatically removed. In my new 10.10 system, if I don't eject the disk using the eject command within the system, the disk remains mounted, even after a new disk is installed.\nThe new drive is a Blue Ray drive, but I haven't noticed any other problems from it.\nNormally, this isn't a problem, but it makes installing applications that are spread over multiple CDs more difficult in many cases (i.e. Wine). Any advice?\n\nA: There's a wide variety of hardware eject buttons for optical drives.  Some of them send a software signal, so that the operating system knows that the disk has been ejected.  Some of them do not do this.  It sounds like your new system has an optical drive that falls into the latter category.  Since optical drives tend to be slow, read-only media, there's a high chance that the operating system will have cached some of the data if you were using it.  Removing the underlying storage without clearing the cache may not immediately result in the data being unavailable (although there is a strong chance that only some files, or even some parts of files remain available without the media).\nThe simple workaround is to always tell the software to eject, rather than using the hardware button.  You might also look at alternate input devices that have an eject button (some keyboards, or wire a special button as an input device, etc.).  The last resort would be to switch your optical drive for another one.\nIn the event that you have removed a disk without unmounting, it should be safe to unmount it from software independent of the removal of the media.  Some drives will automatically rescan when this is done: others will physically eject and need to be reinserted.\n\nA: Before you hit the eject button use lsof to find out what program has files open on the cd and beat it into submission.  Open files prevent it from being unmounted.\n", "Q: Jackd fails to start I'm trying to have a setup where JACK interfaces directly to ALSA and pulseaudio communicates to JACK. This setup worked OK (I had to manually start things a few times) but as I understood the Ubuntu daemon setup and perfected things jackd stopped working completely. I'm running 10.10.\nIf I run something through ALSA I get sound no problem. However, when I run jack with realtime: /usr/bin/jackd -v -R -ch -Z -t2000 -d alsa -P I get the following error:\njackd watchdog: timeout - killing jackd\n\nConversely, if I run without realtime: /usr/bin/jackd -v -r -ch -Z -t2000 -d alsa -P I get:\nALSA: poll time out, polled for 32032138 usecs\nDRIVER NT: could not run driver cycle\n\nJack was working just fine before I made these changes; while I don't have an exact copy of my original configuration I recall running the bare minimum of options worked fine. I've seen some articles saying the problem is with ALSA capture. In fact, I tried enabling capture in alsamixer once and everything worked! On reboot that success was not repeated and I haven't been able to get jack working since. That shouldn't matter because specifying -P should obviate any capture issues.\nShort summary: I can't get jackd to work under any circumstances (unless I specify -d dummy). Sound works with other programs with ALSA, but when I run JACK the daemon opens the card but times out and dies. JACK worked fine before but I can't figure out what changed (or where to even look).\nI should mention I am running with CPU speed throttling on, but I'm using HPET to mitigate this (and I've run jack with no issue before). Thanks!\nEDIT: It looks like it might have to do with the nvidia modules I've loaded; references here and here \n\nA: The nVidia modules are known to behave oddly when interacting with realtime processes, with unpredictable effects on other processes on the system, but the most common issue with starting JACK is not having configured the limits to allow JACK to consume more resources than regular processes.  One solution is to install ubuntustudio-settings and configure the limits therein.  The other is to add your user to the audio group, and create a file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf containing the following:\n@audio - memlock unlimited\n@audio - rtprio 99\n\nOnce you log out, and log in again, you should be able to run JACK in realtime (unless the nVidia drivers are indeed the cause of your issues).  Note that both methods to address the issue are identical in final configuration, although the means of achieving that result differs slightly.  Smaller values for memlock are known to work, but the specific value required seems to differ depending on the underlying hardware, the JACK routing map, and the number of filters being applied: if \"unlimited\" seems too high for you, there are any number of suggestions for specific values on any number of linux audio forums, but I have yet to see any clear guide for calculating the correct value for a given environment.\nBe aware that by default pulseaudio-module-jack does not attach to any output devices: when testing, be sure to check your audio routing in JACK to ensure that output is being rendered in a way you can notice (to working audio out or some graphical visualisation tool) before thinking it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Gnome Activity Journal does not show recently used files I am running ubuntu 10.10, and installed Gnome Activity Journal.

Should the problem persists, run \"zeitgeist-daemon --replace\" and \"zeitgeist-datahub\" in different terminal windows and paste the output of both.\n\nA: You might have black listed something. Check you zeitgeist preferences and make sure you haven't blacklisted anything. Also, you can delete your zeitgeist database (should be in ~/.config I believe) and see if it starts recording again.\n\nA: Try to purge them, not only uninstall them. \nI think with apt-get is apt-get --purge program.

Unfortunately, the open source radeon driver does not work well with the onboard ATI graphics, and ATI's proprietary driver no longer supports the hardware at all. In order to use the ATI proprietary driver with this hardware, it is necessary to use an older version of Xorg, which is now only available in versions of Ubuntu older than 8.10. Unfortunately, the open source radeon driver seems to be causing X to lock up intermittently when my mum uses Audacity.\nI'm willing to accept that some hardware is not well-supported on Ubuntu, and so, because this is a desktop computer with a couple of free PCI slots, I think a better solution might simply be to plug in a new graphics card that might have better driver support, and to disable the onboard ATI card in the BIOS.

Here is a link to the older Nvidia cards that their 3 Legacy drivers support:\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_32667.html\nOnce you install Ubuntu, you should get a notification that an Nvidia proprietary driver is available.  You would then just choose the legacy driver that matches the card.  After the driver is installed, reboot for the computer for the new driver to be used.\n", "Q: Why won't USB 3.0 external hard drive run at USB 3.0 speeds? I recently purchased a PCI Express x1 USB 3.0 controller card (containing the NEC USB 3.0 controller) with the intent of using a USB 3.0 external hard drive with my Linux box. I installed the card in an empty PCIe slot on my motherboard, connected the card to a power cable, strung a USB 3.0 cable between one of the new ports and my external HDD, and connected the HDD to a wall socket for power. Booting the system, the drive works 100% as intended, with the one exception of throughput: rather than using SuperSpeed 4.8 Gbps connectivity, it seems to be falling back to High Speed 480 Mbps USB 2.0-style throughput. Disk Utility shows it as a 480 Mbps device, and running a couple Disk Utility and dd benchmarks confirms that the drive fails to exceed ~40 MB/s (the approximate limit of USB 2.0), despite it being an SSD capable of far more than that.\nWhen I connect my USB 3.0 HDD, dmesg shows this:\n[ 3923.280018] usb 3-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6\n\nwhere I would expect to find this:\n[ 3923.280018] usb 3-2: new SuperSpeed USB device using xhci_hcd and address 6\n\nMy system was running on kernel 2.6.35-25-generic at the time. Then, I stumbled upon this forum thread by an individual who found that a bug, which was present in kernels prior to 2.6.37-rc5, could be the culprit for this type of problem. Consequently, I installed the 2.6.37-generic mainline Ubuntu kernel to determine if the problem would go away. It didn't, so I tried 2.6.38-rc3-generic, and even the 2.6.38 nightly from 2010.02.01, to no avail.\nIn short, I'm trying to determine why, with USB 3.0 support in the kernel, my USB 3.0 drive fails to run at full SuperSpeed throughput.\nSee the comments under this question for additional details.\n\nOutput that might be relevant to the problem (when booting from 2.6.38-rc3):\nRelevant lines from dmesg:\n[   19.589491] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 17\n[   19.589512] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: setting latency timer to 64\n[   19.589516] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: xHCI Host Controller\n[   19.589623] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 12\n[   19.650492] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: irq 17, io mem 0xf8100000\n[   19.650556] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: irq 47 for MSI/MSI-X\n[   19.650560] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: irq 48 for MSI/MSI-X\n[   19.650563] xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: irq 49 for MSI/MSI-X\n[   19.653946] xHCI xhci_add_endpoint called for root hub\n[   19.653948] xHCI xhci_check_bandwidth called for root hub\n\nRelevant section of sudo lspci -v:\n03:00.0 USB Controller: NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 03) (prog-if 30)\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 17\n    Memory at f8100000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]\n    Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 3\n    Capabilities: [70] MSI: Enable- Count=1/8 Maskable- 64bit+\n    Capabilities: [90] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=8 Masked-\n    Capabilities: [a0] Express Endpoint, MSI 00\n    Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting\n    Capabilities: [140] Device Serial Number ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff\n    Capabilities: [150] #18\n    Kernel driver in use: xhci_hcd\n    Kernel modules: xhci-hcd\n\nRelevant section of sudo lsusb -v:\nBus 012 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nDevice Descriptor:\n  bLength                18\n  bDescriptorType         1\n  bcdUSB               3.00\n  bDeviceClass            9 Hub\n  bDeviceSubClass         0 Unused\n  bDeviceProtocol         3 \n  bMaxPacketSize0         9\n  idVendor           0x1d6b Linux Foundation\n  idProduct          0x0003 3.0 root hub\n  bcdDevice            2.06\n  iManufacturer           3 Linux 2.6.38-020638rc3-generic xhci_hcd\n  iProduct                2 xHCI Host Controller\n  iSerial                 1 0000:03:00.0\n  bNumConfigurations      1\n  Configuration Descriptor:\n    bLength                 9\n    bDescriptorType         2\n    wTotalLength           25\n    bNumInterfaces          1\n    bConfigurationValue     1\n    iConfiguration          0 \n    bmAttributes         0xe0\n      Self Powered\n      Remote Wakeup\n    MaxPower                0mA\n    Interface Descriptor:\n      bLength                 9\n      bDescriptorType         4\n      bInterfaceNumber        0\n      bAlternateSetting       0\n      bNumEndpoints           1\n      bInterfaceClass         9 Hub\n      bInterfaceSubClass      0 Unused\n      bInterfaceProtocol      0 Full speed (or root) hub\n      iInterface              0 \n      Endpoint Descriptor:\n        bLength                 7\n        bDescriptorType         5\n        bEndpointAddress     0x81  EP 1 IN\n        bmAttributes            3\n          Transfer Type            Interrupt\n          Synch Type               None\n          Usage Type               Data\n        wMaxPacketSize     0x0004  1x 4 bytes\n        bInterval              12\nHub Descriptor:\n  bLength               9\n  bDescriptorType      41\n  nNbrPorts             4\n  wHubCharacteristic 0x0009\n    Per-port power switching\n    Per-port overcurrent protection\n    TT think time 8 FS bits\n  bPwrOn2PwrGood       10 * 2 milli seconds\n  bHubContrCurrent      0 milli Ampere\n  DeviceRemovable    0x00\n  PortPwrCtrlMask    0xff\n Hub Port Status:\n   Port 1: 0000.0100 power\n   Port 2: 0000.0100 power\n   Port 3: 0000.0100 power\n   Port 4: 0000.0100 power\nDevice Status:     0x0003\n  Self Powered\n  Remote Wakeup Enabled\n\nFull, non-verbose lsusb:\nBus 012 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 011 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 010 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 009 Device 003: ID 04d9:0702 Holtek Semiconductor, Inc. \nBus 009 Device 002: ID 046d:c068 Logitech, Inc.

I very nearly switched my primary computer to Ubuntu prior to the release of Windows 7. There were a few, but significant issues at the time that prevented wholesale adoption, mostly tethering with my phone and lousy VPN Client. \nOne key component I could count on was the Accessibility features. I have recently installed Ubuntu 10.10 and am considering giving it another try, but it appears Ubuntu has taken a leap backwards in that it no longer has a click lock feature for the mouse. \nBasically I need the ability to press and hold the left button to trigger a locking of the button so I can move the mouse by way of a trackpoint with my prosthesis. I absolutely require this feature and it is a deal breaker if it won't work. I've tried the Dwell keys but this is a chaotic control at best. I've never been able to manage a drag of any kind.\n\nA: Have you looked at xte? It's part of the xautomation package.\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\nIt's pretty stable, so you shouldn't need to do any compiling or hacking. \nTyping xte \"mousedown 1\" on a console seems to do what you're looking for. It simulated a click and hold of the first mouse button. The button appears to stay clicked until I click another mouse button.\nTo make the UI work the way you want, you could add xte \"mousedown 1\" to a keybinding. When you hit that key, you'll get the click-and-hold you describe. \nIf you want the click-and-hold behaviour on a mouse click, you could try looking at Compiz. I believe Compiz allows binding commands to mouse button presses. \n\nA: I don't have a for sure answer yet, but here's what I've got so far:\nThe mousetweaks package ought to have what you want. Only, at least in my 10.10 netbook install, it doesn't. I found some documentation, and it looks like there is an additional set of features under the heading mousetweak5. It includes the sort of single click dragging you're talking about. I asked a a question on launchpad to find out more. From all appearances, it isn't implemented. Or possibly was removed. I logged a bug in launchpad against the mousetweak project.\nI found an input driver for X called evdev. It's already used by default in Ubuntu 10.04, and you can edit the rules file: /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf. I got it working, but it sucks. Basically, you assign one of your buttons as go-into-click-lock-mode. You click it, then click the button you want locked. To unlock, you click the special button, then click the locked button. Anyway, what you do is edit that 10-evdev.conf file to add the line Option \"DragLockButtons\"       \"8\". Change 8 to whatever mouse button you want to be the special lock mode button. You can find the numbers of your buttons by running xev It's in the last line of output after clicking. See also: http://www.xfree86.org/current/mouse5.html\nWhat I want to see is an intelligent click lock for mice and trackballs like the synaptic driver provides for touchpads. Ie, a click and drag gesture is active until you tap a second time.\n\nA: I assume you have looked at the mouse accessibility options and the keyboard can be set to mimic a mouse not sure if either of these help.\n\nA: Have you looked at gpointing-device-settings yet? It's in the universe repository, and supposed to replace gsynaptics eventually. It may have a more comprehensive set of options for your trackpoint. I don't know, I don't have a trackpoint to test with.\n", "Q: What does \"Missing Recommends\" in Synaptic package manager mean? In the Synaptic Package Manager, under 'Custom Filters,' what is the \"Missing Recommends' entry?  \n\nA: That filter lists packages that should (but aren't required to) be installed. Those packages are packages recommended by others. For example, OpenOffice.org would appear in that filter if you uninstall OO.org. Your system should work correctly if have packages in that list.\n", "Q: Installation-Allocate drive space/Boot Loader When I try to install Ubuntu 10.10 from the official livedisc I got in the mail, when I get to the \"Allocate Disk Space\" step I cannot get it to work.

Please advise which wireless-N usb adapters should work seamlessly with Ubuntu 10.04. I have tried SMC and Linksys, but they all need to have drivers compiled for them. \n\nA: It's a good question, and the wiki page most people mention ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported)  is outdated and user-submitted information that is sometimes incorrect, it seems.\nThese pages are a good place to start, although they are probably more helpful if you have the lspci info to hand. (Previous experience shows that some cards with the same model name contain different chipsets!)\nhttp://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/FAQ\nhttp://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Devices/USB\nI am also on the lookout for a similar card, and would like to hear personal recommendation including from an ubuntu expert with a USB wireless-n device working flawlessly out of the box (and at n-speeds rather than g-speeds) in 10.04 and later.\n\nA: Intel's Wireless-N is good and out-of-the box (at least my Mini PCI-express one) Intel also have a good reputation for drivers (mostly) in Linux.\n\nA: I use some of the D-Link N adapters. If I remember correctly, the DWA-130 works out-of-the box, while the DWA-160 would require a simple install of this ndiswrapper software to use the Windows driver. But they both seem to work well.\n\nA: That is the only way around. Currently I am using the same method on Windows drivers with Linksys PCI N Adapter and I am just fine.\n\nA: This article identifies 5 which are said to work in Linux. I haven't tested any, but may report back when I do.\n\nA: I use an ASUS USB N-13 dongle.It does not work right out the box but you can Google instructions on how to make it work.I takes less than 5 minutes.Mine has working flawlessly for years now!Here's a link with the instructions on how to make the dongle work with Lucid.http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1499153\nHope this helps!!!!\n", "Q: How can I stop Ubuntu from automatically unmounting Samba shares? I have some music files I'd like to listen to sitting on a Samba share. I added this share via the Ubuntu GUI (Places -> Connect to server...), and everything worked just fine.\nHowever, despite the fact that my music file is playing from this location, after I've not touched the location using the Nautilus GUI, Ubuntu/GNOME decides that I'm not using the share anymore and terminates the connection. Thus, my music stops playing and Rhythmbox is unhappy with me. Simply clicking on the new shortcut the \"Connect to server...\" bit created for me immediately makes the files come back again and allows me to restart the music playing.\nHow can I have Ubuntu not automatically dismount samba shares?\n\nA: This is the method I have used successfully from 9.10 through 10.10 by mounting the shares with fstab following these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have smbfs installed first.\n\n*Create new directory(s) to mount the share to in terminal eg sudo mkdir /media/my_share\n\n*Open fstab in gedit gksudo gedit /etc/fstab also in terminal\n\n*Add one line per share example music, films, tv etc\n//192.168.1.102/share_name /media/my_share cifs credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0\n\nobviously changing the IP address, share_name and my_share to the relevant folders\n\n*Lastly create a hidden .smbcredentials file in root and open it in gedit\ngksudo gedit /root/.smbcredentials\n\nand add these lines to the new file\nusername=theuser\npassword=thepass\n\nif you have no password for the shares then leave them blank and if you have many different share passwords then create multiple credentials files.\nyou will then need to change the owner of the credentials file\nsudo chmod 700 /root/.smbcredentials\n\nonce all of this is in place you can test your setup by typing sudo mount -a in the terminal and your shares will be mounted.\nfrom now on they will automatically mount when you log in.\n\nA: This is a problem with GVFS. See this post for a workaround. Hopefully someone adds a better way to do this.\nAs an alternative you could use the standard mount-command, which does not have these limitations.\n\nA: If you have a server, it may be worth moving it over to a fixed IP... If it's Ubuntu Server look here: How To Geek\n(Ignore the line sudo apt-get remove dhcp-client as there's no need for it)\n\nA: Im pretty sure samba times itself out after a time and unmounts. Its a security feature I think (even if you are connecting to a share without a password). \n", "Q: Configuration of mail server to relay emails This is part of a project wherein I have to send mail...\nI have a mail-server with domain abc.com.  How do I allow that mail-server to receive mail from another domain, cde.com?\nAnd how do I transfer all mail to the root user?\nFor the first question, I think I need the mail-server configured in open relay.\nUsing postfix, the default configuration is for open relay...right?\n\nA: No. As default postfix is not configure as an open relay, it will only accept local mail.\nAnd you don't want to configure it as an Open Relay. In a couple of days some spammer is going to find it and start using it. As a result:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer is going to be bogged down sending thousands of emails.\n\n*Your server is going to be blocked by most other mail servers in the world in a couple of days. Including all the major ones (gmail, yahoo, hotmail, mines ;)).\n\n\nSo you will be unable to send mails and the internet will a little worse for the rest of us.\nIf you want to be able to send mail from some IPs without authentication you need to set (or add) this options in /etc/postfix/main.cf\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.1.0/24\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated,permit_mynetworks,reject_unauth_destination\n\nOf course the IP that defines mynetwork should be changed to one that fits you.\n\nA: Main should never be delivered to the root account. Normally there is an alias for root in /etc/aliases to deliver the email to the another account.  If you have a limited number of accounts you need to consolidate, the easiest way is to add entries to /etc/aliases.  This can be configured to send the email to an address on another server if desired.  \nTo send email configure your mailserver to use a Smarthost.  I generally recommend using your ISPs relay server.  If all your mail will be going to one domain, you may be able to use that domain's MX (mail exchange) as your Smarthost.  You can verify delivery by looking at /var/log/mail.log (or wherever postfix logs its messages). \nIf you want to reliably send email directly to the Internet, get a static address. See email delivery management grievances  for some guidance. \nReliable incoming mail delivery requires a static IP address.  There are programs to fetch mail from another server such as fetchmail that work well when mail is delivered to another server.  \nIf you mail server is MX for abc.com it will be able to accept mail for its domain without being an open relay.  Configuring an open relay is not a good idea.\nI would recommend you use a name like mail.abc.com or even www.abc.com for your mail server rather than abc.com.  It will be able to send mail for abc.com.  It is a good idea to configure it as an MX for abc.comif it is doing so. Second level domains are rarely used by legitimate mail servers.\n\nA: I think that fetchmail is what you need to get mail from other domains, and it will pass them onto whatever local user you want as well.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu using CLI commands from a live CD? I was wondering if there is any way of installing Ubuntu from command line using the Ubuntu Live CD.\nI am aware of the alternate CD text install, but just wanted to know if its possible to do so from the Live CD installer.\n\nA: You need the text-based alternate install CD....then the installation is in text mode.

(assuming you didn't reboot your computer, in which case the changes should be active already).\nBut why do you want to disable ipv6? The log messages wont harm your computer. \nOh, and if you want to disable only the privacy extensions part of ipv6 (which you probably wont need on a server anyway), put the key net.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr = 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nA: On an openSUSE 11.2 box that has a much newer kernel than original, I was getting this message too.\nThe use_tempaddr setting above is already -1 so that is no fix.\nHowever elsewhere several people have said that shutting off vsftpd stops their messages.\nAnd, as an LXC user I happen to be aware of an unusual thing vsftpd does with the namespaces support in newer kernels which causes a problem when vsftpd is used within an LXC container.\nIt turns out merely disabling that namespace-based isolation feature in vsftpd is enough to halt the messages at least for me.\nAdd the following to /etc/vsftpd.conf:\n\nisolate=NO\nisolate_network=NO\n\nThen restart vsftpd.\nipv6 and vsftpd are both still enabled yet no more privacy extension messages.\n\nA: As answered by Brian K. White,\nI just reconfigured /etc/vsftpd.conf with the undocumented isolate_network=NO and it did the trick.\nOne minor difference about his answer is, that I didn't had to set isolate=NO.\nThis configuration variable reverts vsftpd to use fork(). Otherwise it would use clone() with CLONE_NEWNET parameter. This would put the process accessing the files into a separate networking environment that cannot access any network. (I have found this information on another answer on ServerFault)\nI followed this path, because I saw those log messages appear after I've setup vsftpd.\n\nA: To check if IPv6 is enabled or disabled\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\n0 means it’s enabled and 1 is disabled.\nTo disable IPv6\n$ su -\n# nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand add these lines to sysctl.conf file\n#disable ipv6\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nSave sysctl.conf file with new config, then reboot your system\n# reboot\n\nCheck your system again\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6\n\nNow you should see “1″ means IPv6 has been disabled on your system.\nHow to disable IPv6 on Ubuntu and Linux Mint\n", "Q: Search function in the terminal?

What is the code to make a script run on startup that binds the home folders with other folders depending on if a drive is present?\nBecause most of my files are kept in separate drives and places than /home/John/Folder, I use Terminal code to bind the Home folders for different places. For example, I bind the /Documents folder with /Dropbox/Documents so it's constantly backed up. I've found out how to do this through the terminal, and read somewhere that you can put code in the /etc/rc.local script and that that script (rc.local) runs on start up. I've put the code into that script, but I'm not sure how to get that to run on startup. Right now I have to wait till the computer has started up, then run the code in the terminal. The full code in that script I've set is below.\nsudo mount -o bind /media/Storage/Music ~/Music && sudo mount -o bind /media/storage/downloads ~/Downloads && sudo mount -o bind /media/2TB/Videos ~/Videos && sudo mount -o bind /home/john/dropbox/documents ~/Documents && sudo mount -o bind /home/john/dropbox/Photos ~/Pictures && exit 0\n\nThe exit 0 is needed for the script to run, according to a comment in the script.\nSince this on a laptop and I keep my video files on an external drive, is there anyway to add a simple \"If  is present, also bind ~/Videos to /media//Videos,\" and if it's not, skip over it? Or put that code at the end so it doesn't affect the above execution?\n\nA: There are multiple issues with your script:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are chaining (&&) unrelated commands, a failure on one will skip the rest.\n\n*You are using \"~\" in the path name, the script is invoked with root, whicih means it will be translated into /root, you must use the full path name\n\n*You don't need to use sudo because it's running with root.\n\n\nThe folllowing script will do what you have requested:\n[[ -d /media/Storage/Music ]] &&  mount -o bind /media/Storage/Music /home/your_user/Music \n[[ -d /media/storage/downloads ]] && mount -o bind /media/storage/downloads /home/your_user/Downloads\n[[ -d /media/2TB/Videos ]] && mount -o bind /media/2TB/Videos /home/your_user/Videos \nmount -o bind /home/john/dropbox/documents /home/your_user/Documents \nmount -o bind /home/john/dropbox/Photos /home/your_user/Pictures\nexit 0\n\n\nA: In a BASH script...\n#check for existence of a directory\nif [ ! -d /media/Videos ]; then\n    // do nothing or echo \"not available\"\nelse\n    // action\nfi\n\n#check for existence of a file\nif [ ! -f /media/Videos/i_am_mounted ]; then\n    // do nothing or echo \"not available\"\nelse\n    // action\nfi\n\nYou can also stop using the && this way. (If you have command1 && command2, command2 is executed if and only if command1 exited with exit code 0 (success).) And you have some local, some network. The network portion might belong in scripts placed in /etc/network/if-up.d and /etc/network/if-down.d. The local portion might belong in /etc/rc.local - to stop using sudo command.\n", "Q: Which log will tell me why my computer shut down? I was at school SSHing to my homebox.

AFAIK, you cannot run two OS's at once without virtualizing one of them.\nSo here is what I found on moving an OS from a hard drive to a virtual machine\n\nConvert your Computer into a Virtual\n  Machine\nThere's a new\n  utility from Microsoft that makes it\n  both simple and free to convert an\n  existing installation of Windows into\n  a virtual machine ready to run on any\n  other computer.\nMicrosoft’s Sysinternals team has\n  released a simple application called\n  Disk2vhd, that lets you easily migrate\n  an existing computer to a virtualized\n  hard drive (VHD). It's a tiny utility\n  doesn't even require instillation.\n  Create Virtual Hard Disks with\n  Disk2VHD\nWhen you run Disk2vhd, it will\n  immediately show you all the drives\n  and partitions on your computer that\n  it can migrate to a VHD.  Simply\n  select a drive that you wish to create\n  a VHD file from and click “Create.”\n  Disk2vhd will convert the hard drive\n  into a VHD file even if the computer\n  /drive is currently in use.\nWhen the Virtual Machine VHD file is\n  created, you can run it in any desktop\n  virtualization program including the\n  free Windows Virtual PC, Virtual Box,\n  or VMware Player. You can also mount\n  the virtual machine as a standard hard\n  drive in Windows 7, and can even boot\n  from it if your computer is running\n  Windows 7 Ultimate.\nYou may use Disk2vhd to create virtual\n  machines of your Windows XP, Windows\n  Server 2003, Windows Vista and higher\n  machines, including x64 systems.

You can\n  then consider creating a virtual\n  machine of your old machine using the\n  Microsoft utility and this will help\n  you use all your favorite programs\n  (with the same settings) on the new\n  machine.\nYou can also use virtualization to\n  create a ghost image of your hard\n  drive in a single file and this will\n  be handy in the event of a disk\n  failure.\nDisk2vhd is an useful tool that will\n  make it much easier for you to enjoy\n  the benefits of virtualization without\n  being too technical.\n\nFrom labnol.org\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu minimal and must have packages I am planning on installing Ubuntu from the minimal CD image so that I can install what I want to. \nAny suggestions for must have packages that I should be installing? Like for example GNOME is one. I am looking for personal experiences. \nShould GNOME be enough to get me up and running?\n\nA: The minimal cd image is a misnomer.  It does not mean it installs a minimal Ubuntu system; it means it is the smallest image you can download.  This is so because it does not have packages on it.  It only boots up and downloads everything over the network.  It should be called the net install image, rather than minimal.\nIf you want more control over what packages are installed, use the alternate cd with the text mode installer.\n\nA: Depending on what you want to do with your computer, I'd say the main must-have package is the X server (and related packages). This will allow you to run any number of the available window managers and/or desktop environments, and is the base for most all GUI interaction you'll have with your computer.\nIf you're looking to utilize the sound hardware on your computer, I'd also highly recommend ALSA, and possibly PulseAudio. You'll have a very quiet computing experience without ALSA, as it runs your sound card and allows other programs to do so as well.\nThere are many other combinations of packages you might need, all depending on what you plan on doing with your system, but those two groups are pretty common to most desktop setups.\n", "Q: Skype shows a blank window on the webcam part what could be the problem?

This is easy to do with tools such as openshot or pitivi but it is time consuming.\nIs there a script or command that can be used to automate this process?\n\nA: This may be helpful, even though it requires that you have the album art separate from the audio\nfile. and that the audio be in .mp3 format, you could however, look at the command and alter it to suit other input and output formats.\nAt your terminal in a directory containing the image and audio files you could use ffmpeg like this:\nffmpeg -loop_input -r ntsc -i cover_art.jpg -i test.mp3 -acodec copy -shortest -qscale 5 out.avi\n\nThis will take cover_art.jpg and test.mp3 and create a video out.avi with cover_art.jpg as the video and test.mp3 as the audio track of length the duration of the audio track.\nffmpeg may have to be compiled with restricted formats enabled.\nA great automation would be to find something that can extract the art from the audio file and use that image with ffmpeg.\n", "Q: Installation is unusably slow, booting from live USB Here are the screens.

If you have that hardware, the first thing I would do is unplug the card reader and try again.  If the problem persists, the way to go is to boot with some extra kernel params, such as acpi=noirq, acpi=off, noapic, nolapic, pci=biosirq, irqpoll or pnpbios=off.  It's much of a trial&error thing, but normally acpi=noirq, noapic and nolapic together should do the trick.\nA BIOS upgrade helps too...\n\nA: In my experience, (And all I've ever booted from is a USB.

This is not exactly a normal installation but it's close enough for most purposes. \n\nA: Looks like you are talking about wubi. Run the installer, and wait until it downloads the iso image. If you already have the iso image put it in the same folder with the installer and run the installer.

The following solution is applied to my system and has been tested on fontmatrix, that is QT5 app.\nYou can apply QT styles that recreate GTK look and feel via the packages qt5-style-kvantum (theme manager) and qt5-style-kvantum-themes (collection of styles). To install them, run the command:\nsudo apt install qt5-style-kvantum qt5-style-kvantum-themes\nThen, you need to tell to your system to use kvantum style for QT5 apps. This is performed by setting the QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE variable in your .profile file.\nYou have two alternative ways.\nAlternative 1\n\n*\n\n*run echo \"export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum\" >> $HOME/.profile\nAlternative 2:\n\n*\n\n*open the file with gedit $HOME/.profile\n\n*add the line (if not present) export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum\n\n*save the file.\n\nAfter changing the .profile file, you have to logout from your account and login, then it will be sourced automatically.\nNow, open the Kvantum Manager app from the app-grid menu:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the submenu \"Change/Delete Theme\"\n\n*Select \"KvYaru\" from \"Select Menu\".\n\n*Click \"Use this theme\" button.\n\n\nThis is the way to activate a style that resembles the default Ubuntu theme, called Yaru. By default, a lots of themes are installed, so you can choose what you prefer.\nThe Kvantum project is available at this GitHub page.\n\nA: First you need the KDE's \"System settings\" application by installing  systemsettings \nfrom the Software Center.\nSearch the dash for System settings and launch it .\nThen make the following changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*under Style → Applications → Widget style, select GTK+\n\n*under Colors, select the colours to match your GTK theme or download the Ambiance colour scheme  .\n\n*under Icons → Theme, select the icon theme you are using in GTK apps\n\n*under Fonts select \"Ubuntu\", size 11 \n\n", "Q: How can I increase the maximum number of simultaneous users to log in to a server?

My laptop is Lenovo with Windows 7. \nI was wondering if I dual install Ubuntu, the Windows recovery partition will be of no use any more? I am confused because I heard of this and don't understand why.\nThanks and regards! \n\nA: If you can set to boot from it, it can still be useful.  It will, however, destroy your ubuntu partition if you choose to restore.  \nthe destruction of the ubuntu partition is based off of this \"recovery\" partition just restoring an image instead of doing a REAL install.  while it may not be true in absolutely every case, it almost always is true.  i have personally used a recovery partition to restore the OS after installing multiple linux and bsd derivatives.  i can't speak to the lenovo recovery specifically.\n\nA: Trying to restore your Win7 system will destroy an Ubuntu installation. Suggestion: When you installed and configured WinXP/7 system you always peform a backup of WinXP/7 partition by mean of backup software (for Windows). So you will be able to restore corrupted Windows system later. It does not harm your Ubuntu installation, however it may overwrite Grub settings. In such case, you may restore your Grub by use of software like SuperGrub. It will reconstruct your Grub functionality.      \n", "Q: Automatic shutdown / hibernation after x minutes in suspend? I have an embedded battery powered device running Ubuntu and want to reduce power  consumption. The idea is that if a user does not use a device for ca. 30 min. then the device will automatically shutdown or hibernate. \nIs it possible to automatically shut down or hibernate Ubuntu after spending x minutes in suspend?\n\nA: Suspend is an hardware managed state, such function if available would need to be implemented at the BIOS level, or at least would require BIOS support.\nUnless your BIOS provides such programmable function, no, it is not possible. \n\nA: You can try gshutdown   from the Software Center.\nIf the default options are not working, try changing from Edit>Preferences>Actions the \"autodetect\" option to \"custom command\", press  \"Turn off the computer\" and fill it with the  shutdown -h now command.\n\nA: The installation here : http://gshutdown.tuxfamily.org/en/download.php works well (gshutdown_0.2-1_i386.deb)\n", "Q: Get bottom panel back I'm trying Avant Window Navigator(AWN) and I would like to delete my bottom panel to test only the AWN.\nBut, if I don't like it, is there a way to get my bottom panel back?\n\nA: Yes, if required later you can  reset the gnome panel, intructions available at Resetting gnome panel .\n", "Q: How to turn compiz on?

Is it due to the VGA? How can I get visual effects to work?\n\nA: if compiz doesn't work with your chipset, then visual effects WILL fail.  if compiz does work with your chipset and the acceleration is poor(read as in software), you may realise that it sort of works, but the effects are really choppy.  i have used intel chipsets and had compiz work, but with choppy effects.  \nan acer aspire netbook with onboard intel and shared video ram is a directly pertinent use case that i have worked through.  some effects work okay, others introduce too much overhead and make the desktop nigh on unusable.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu 10.10 boot faster? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to make Ubuntu boot fast? \n\nhi, i m using Ubuntu 10.10 64bit OS. while booting in a black screen it shows blinking \"_\" about 10 seconds. how can it be solved?\n\nA: the blinking dash is usually your gui loading.\nfor any operating system windows ubuntu or otherwise you can go to your startup programs menu and limit the ammount of programs that load at startup and that will definitely speed up your startup. the other option is to turn off your gui and rely on the cli as some users do it would boot alot faster as there are no graphics to load\n", "Q: Receive mail from any domain I have a mail server whose domain name is \"vrk.com\" and a user named \"vinod\" in it...\nAll the mails send to \"vinod@vrk.com\" comes into the mail box /home/vinod/mbox\nCan i store mails addressed to \"blahblah@yahoo.com\" in this same mail box i.e /home/vinod/mbox...or into another catch all kind of user which catches all the mails regardless of the domain???? is it possible...i am using Postfix....\n\nA: You can't capture emails addressed to yahoo.com since Yahoo's MX records don't point to your server, so they'll never get routed through your postfix service.\nIf you're trying to create a catchall for a specific domain what you'll need to do is create a Virtual Domain file for postfix\nsudoedit /etc/postfix/virtual\n\nIn the virtual file add the following:\n@vrk.com vinod\n\nReplace @vrk.com with the name of the domain you want to create the catch-all with (in your question this is where yahoo.com goes - however, as mentioned prior, you can't actually use yahoo.com as a valid domain since Yahoo's mail doesn't route to you) and the vinod part should be replaced with the email username that the catch-all should go to.\nOnce you've created this file you'll need to encode it. That is done simply with the following:\npostmap /etc/postfix/virtual\n\nThis does all the jazz (encoding, validating, etc) that Postfix needs in order to read it. To finish things up you'll want to add some lines to the configuration file and restart postfix\nOpen the configuration file with sudoedit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add this line to the bottom\nvirtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual\n\nThen the restart with sudo service postfix restart!\n\nA: If you want to consolidate email from various POP3 accessible servers you can use the fetchmail package to fetch the email and deliver it to your server.  For freemail services like yahoo you will likely need to enable POP for the address you wish to fetch. Documentation on configuring fetchmail will likely be in /usr/share/doc/fetchmail or by web at 'http://localhost/doc/fetchmail`.\n", "Q: How do I turn on SSL for test server?

It can be enabled with the command sudo a2ensite default-ssl.\nYou will also need to enable mod ssl.  This can be done with the command sudo a2enmod ssl.  This will point you to /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for directions on configuring SSL and generting a self-signed certificate. it can be viewed with the command zless  /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz \nOnce you have the certificates installed, you can restart apache with the command sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart.  \n\nA: You can add it within apache or add it with a proxy (like nginx).  I prefer setting up an SSL proxy locally or remotely in the first place.  This way if I need to install a WAF or IDS later, there are less modifications required.\n", "Q: OpenSource Flow Charting I'm looking for an application that drops output in a portable format, maybe export as an image file so I can flowchart some application designs and submit them to my boss for professional review. From what I've seen dia is about the de-facto standard for linux flowcharting, but maybe some of you out there in askubuntu land have some other suggestions for me to examine. \nPlease keep in mind it has to offer a professional / attractive look on the final product. Maybe some color coordination of the options (logic structures are all purple, input statements are orange... for example)\n\nA: I would add inkscape \n to the possibility list.  Output is svg by default, so it is very portable will render well.  (Flowchart hint -- use the connector tool.)   If you are comfortable with the interface, inkscape is wonderful and very flexible.  SVG/XML documents created in the software are also hand-tweakable, if that's your cup of tea.\nAnother tool that I discovered from this askubuntu is pencil.\n Here's one of the threads discussing it: FOSS GUI Prototyping\nThere are also some community-provided flowcharting stencils on their stencils page.  I'm not sure if this is what you need, but it might be worth checking out.\n\nA: I use Google Docs for creating flow charts. It's not open source, but it is free (as in beer) and does create attractive graphics. Here's an example of a simply chart\n\nIt's not very complex in that it doesn't 'know' about different types of charts - it's intended as a sandbox that you can use to create whatever chart you need. You have a wide range of shapes that you can place on the canvas, with a wide range of colours with which to fill them, easily selectable from a dropdown menu in the toolbar. It also allows you to 'snap' your shapes to an invisible line that has them aligned with each other - just place a few shapes on the canvas then start moving another one around and see what I mean.\nYou can download the finished images as PDF, SVG, PNG and JPG files.\nYou will need a Google account to use it, but you have the added bonus of not having to worry about saving them periodically, and you don't risk loosing them which, if they're for work, will be a great help.\nPersonally, I've never liked Dia. I've always had to fight with it to get it to do what I want, and it always made me do things in incredibly convoluted ways. The 'drawing' feature in Google Docs just feels 'right'.\n\nA: Perhaps xmind is an option. It's much more than just a Mindmapper.\nExamples:\nhttp://www.xmind.net/share/test00/flow-chart/\nhttp://www.xmind.net/share/andi_iium/ip-geolocation-techniques/\n\nA: Personally I'm a fan of tcm, Toolkit for conceptual modeling (it's available from the repositories). Mainly because the file format is textual, so you can edit it with a text editor if need be, and you can export it to PS and EPS which goes great with LaTeX, and FIG which allows you to edit it with xfig. It also enforces UML standards, disallowing you to stray from them. The GUI and resulting models do not look very \"pretty\" though.\nIf you need to cooperate with people using different operating systems (like Windows and Mac OSX), consider umlet (also available from the repositories). It's written in java, and the only one I've found that is easily usable and installable on Windows, OSX and Linux. It also allows you to export to useful formats, like SVG, EPS and PDF, as well as the common image formats.\n\nA: There is another software to make flow charts called yED.\nCheck it out.\n\nA: you can use for Flow Chart Design:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice Draw (Formerly OpenOffice Draw) (You can give it colors to the elements)\n\n*Kivio (From the KDE KOffice Suite)\n\n*Inkscape\n\n\nIf you are talking about Gantt Flow then\n\n\n*\n\n*Planner\n\n*Dia\n\n*Opensched\n\n*Umbrello\n\nA: Meanwhile there is a desktop version of draw.io based on electron which is also available as a .deb package.

I remember reading on the Canonical website around the launch of the Ubuntu One Music store that after revenue was divided between Canonical, 7 digital and the artists involved that all profit or a significant percentage would be donated to a charity. \nThis information has either disappeared from their website or my detective skills have failed me once more. Does anybody happen to understand the break down of revenue generated by the Ubuntu One Music Store or even know where to find this information. \nAlso it would be useful to know which charity benefits from this. (Not that that would impact upon my purchases or send me running to iTunes. ;) Promise) \n\nA: If you open Rythmbox and go to the Ubuntu One Store, it states the following:\n\nThe Ubuntu One Music Store is a service from Canonical, the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu. The technology partner for the music store is 7digital, a UK-based company with a long history in the digital music industry.\n\nAnd from Wikipedia:\n\nFurther criticism concerns the choice of the patented mp3 format for the music of the Ubuntu One Music Store and the unclear revenue share that will be granted to the community.\n\nThis was all I could find. I haven't heard anything about any revenue sharing, to be honest.\n\nA: The proper 7digital affiliate program starts at 4% comission on all sales. This slides up with more sales.\nHowever the bond between Canonical and 7digital is somewhat stronger than the typical affiliate link in that they're using a branded store. This may alter the rates negatively but this really sn't known outside Canonical or 7d. However, given the number of sales it probably generates, I think at least 4% would still be a fair estimate.\nWhat happens to the commission also isn't known but I think it would be more than fair to assume it rolls back into the company behind Ubuntu to try and help them break even.\nAt 7digital's end, where the cash goes is another unknown. They do this to make money, like Apple, Amazon and everybody else. How much the artist gets is between their label (or them directly if they don't have one) and 7d. \"Not much\" would be my guess.\n", "Q: What is the best tool to sync browser passwords and bookmarks? Sadly, everything I've tried so far has been painful to manage between two computers, (even between different browsers on the same computer).  \nSo, right now I have different aggregations of bookmarks passwords in xmarks, delicious, google bookmarks, firefox sync, text files, and in figaro password manager (fpm2). \nI've also tried to use bindwood in the past.  \nWhat I would like to do is merge all bookmarks and passwords into some solution that actually works either with tools available under Ubuntu, or with a browser-based tool (addon/plugin/extension) which works between between google-chrome/chromium, and firefox.  \nIt would be ideal if there was an ability to send and store passwords encrypted (if not on my own server).  Whatever the method, I need the ability to have import from existing sources.  (It doesn't have to be pretty, just repeatable.)\nIt's possible that some things I've ruled out are now workable (e.g., xmarks broke for me at one point because I hit their bookmark limit for the server/account, and bindwood, firefox sync were firefox only).\n\nA: I'm not aware of any cross-browser methods for synchronizing the passwords stored within the browser, but I find that the combination of KeePassX and Dropbox (or Ubuntu One) works well enough for my needs.\n\nA: Lastpass works great for passwords (I use it with Chrome and Firefox, also on my Android device). XMarks works great for me for bookmarks (LastPass just recently acquired Xmarks, so there is likely integration coming). These tools work great across browsers, but also across platforms. Not sure why XMarks broke for you, but you may want to try again. I find it very stable and handles a huge amount of bookmarks for me.\n\nA: For passwords as mentioned LastPass is really great.\nFor bookmark sync I use the Google Account sync with Chrome.\n", "Q: Install Quickbooks Premier 2010 I have been trying to get Quickbooks Premier 2010 to run in Wine.

I can't even open a terminal. \nHowever when I hit the power button, the computer would pop out the Ubuntu shutdown screen briefly and shut down.\nI figure out I should delete the updates package for my graphic card, but I don't even get a chance to go to text terminal, please help me! \n\nA: I got into the same \"blank screen on startup\" problem on my T400, after installing the suggested ATI driver. This notebook has 2 graphics chips, and the OS can switch / choose between them.\nI could resolve the problem by adjusting two BIOS settings (hit F1 after power-on\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Config > Display > Graphics Device: Discrete Graphics\n\n*Config > Display > OS Detection for Switchable Graphics: Disabled\n\n\nA: One approach is to disable quiet in the boot options and read the debug messages to see how far you get in the boot process.  \nIf this doesn't work then to toubleshoot, you might want to boot to recovery console or runlevel 1, chroot appropriately, and init 3.  This will get most of your stuff loaded and let you see if you are having a service hang.   \nThis should cover the possibility that some service or other is hanging during initialization.  \nI really doubt it's a \"bad\" driver in current stable.  \nYou could just need to generate a new plymouth or xwindows config.  Generating a new xorg.conf and testing is covered here.  Plymouth might black your screen for a bit, but it should pass if you get to fully booted.  \nI thought I had a similar problem once, and it was a plymouth glitch that blanked the screen combined with a fsck due to the number of times the disk is mounted.  You could try pressing [c] to cancel the disk check in case it's occurring or manually fsck your drives from recovery console to eliminate this possibility. \n\nA: You could try booting into safe mode if GRUB loads correctly and fixing the driver then by choosing System-> Administation-> Additional Drivers and use the ATI proprietary driver. \nOnce done you will need to reboot and you should be into a normal desktop.\n\nA: ThinkPad T400 seems to be a laptop, but if you are using a different item just dismiss my answer.\nWhat you are experiencing may be related to the ability of your video card to handle both the LCD and the external monitor configurations.\nEven if this may sound silly, try connecting an external monitor and you may get the boot correctly in the secondary monitor. After that and just if it worked as we expect, upgrade or downgrade your video drivers in order to avoid this problem. My suggestion would be to remove all the drivers and after a reboot, try to install the one which was working before the update.\n", "Q: Tmp directory deleted, I cannot login to the system I missinput a command in a directory(I don't remember what it is.)\n\nsudo rm -f -r tmp\n\nafter that when I restart and log in, I cannot login use the user I have delete the tmp.\nHowever, I can log in with user: root.\nCan I resolve the problem?\n\nA: The question is not very clear. \nIf you actually did sudo rm -f -t /tmp (instead of just tmp) or executed the command while you are at /, it could have actually removed your /tmp directory. /tmp is used for multiple purposes for temporary data storage.\nIf that is the case, you can do sudo mkdir /tmp and sudo chmod 1777 /tmp (assuming /tmp is not a separate filesystem)  to recreate /tmp directory and to set correct permissions.\n", "Q: Installation of a package to a custom directory Is there any option to install a package to my home directory (or /foo)  instead of system wide ? I am looking for options using  apt-get or dpkg.\nSomething similar to --prefix in a source compile.\nWhat I am looking for co-existing of different versions of openJDK for testing purposes.\n\nA: A debian package needs to be compliant to the FHS, that clearly defines where to put data and where to install applications on any system. This clear structure makes administration easy and we all should stick to that.\nIn your case, when it comes to testing applications an installation to a custom directory may be desired. However there is no way to tell your package manager not to use the predefined file locations from an exisiting DEB package.\nIf you need an installation to another location you may need to compile your package from source, as you already pointed out. Alternatively, and if you need to use dpkg you will have to build your own private DEB where you can define other installation paths. If however the application relies on access to files located on a FHS-compliant path it may not run the way developers intended.\nFor installing testing versions of applications you may consider a chroot (or schroot) environment. The safest solution (though maybe overkill) for testing is installing applications in a virtual OS (e.g. through Virtual Box)\n", "Q: Any way to remove Totem but still have video thumbnails in Nautilus? I prefer to use VLC because it never gives me problems while Totem does. I'd like to uninstall Totem, so all file associations point to VLC. However I still want to have video thumbnails in Nautilus.\n\nA: It's not actually uninstalling it but if you do sudo cp /usr/share/applications/totem.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/totem.desktop and then gedit ~/.local/share/applications/totem.desktop and add a new line Hidden=true the desktop will completely forget totem exists. It will no longer be used for file associations and will not show up in the menus but the thumbnailer should continue to function.\n\nA: I think you have to leave the totem-common package installed. You can remove all of the other totem packages and still have thumbnails.\nAfter that check the preview tab in nautilus preferences\n\nAs you can see I have everything set to local and anything over 10MB won't get one. Meaning most videos apart from a few family videos. You can change this up to 4GB.\nIf you have changed this and still no joy, then try deleting your ~/.thumbnails folder. Go to your home folder and press ctrl+h to show the hidden files and folders. After this log out or restart nautilus and after a few minutes it should start to rebuild the thumbnail cache (ps good way to get some drive space back). If this doesn't work or nothing happens hours after restarting nautilus then a re-installation of Nautilus may be required. To do this open Synaptic package manager and search for nautilus right click on the checkmark next to the package and select re-install from the menu.\n\nA: Try installing ffmpeg thumbnailer.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu compatible with MacBooks?

One Windows, one for shared files, one for Ubuntu.

In pratice, the access time is much more important than the sequential read/write speed. I doubt that you would see a real performance increase during you normal usage.\nIf you're reinstalling anyway, I would put the most performance-critical partitions to the beginning. I would not repartition just for the reordering, it's too much effort for too little gain.\n", "Q: How do I remap certain keys or devices? I'm searching for a way to remap certain keys in ubuntu.\ni.e. \nI'd like to change PgUp to Home or PgDown to End.\nDoes a built-in command or a tool exist reassign keys in Ubuntu/GNOME?\n\nA: In order to do global remaps independently of X, you can make use of console-setup(5) instead.\nIn my case I wanted to remap Caps Lock key to D, since my D-key is broken :)\nFirst I used dumpkeys(1) to get a template for a mapping, in the case of the D-key, the interesting bit is the mapping for keycode 32 (on my keyboard); Note that there are two spaces in the grep pattern!\n$ sudo dumpkeys | grep \"keycode  32\" > tempfile\n$ cat tempfile\nkeycode  32 = +d\n    shift   keycode  32 = +D\n    altgr   keycode  32 = +eth\n    shift   altgr   keycode  32 = +ETH\n    control keycode  32 = Control_d\n    shift   control keycode  32 = Control_d\n    altgr   control keycode  32 = Control_d\n    shift   altgr   control keycode  32 = Control_d\n(121 lines total...)\n\nIn order to change the map to apply to Caps Lock (keycode 58 on my keyboard) instead\nsed 's/32/58/' -i tempfile\n\nNow it reads\nkeycode  58 = +d\n    shift   keycode  58 = +D\n    altgr   keycode  58 = +eth\n(etc...)\n\nTo add this remap to the default map, it simply needs to be appended to the remap include file for console-setup\nsudo sh -c 'cat tempfile >> /etc/console-setup/remap.inc'\n\nand console-setup needs to be reconfigured (skipping low priority questions with -phigh)\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup -phigh\n\nNow the remap should be completed, and be loaded automatically on boot.\n\nA: I spent one whole day in trying to create a shortcut for Ctrl+Pageup.\nI first tried xmodmap but that can't generate modifier events. So it is impossible to create a shortcut that generates for example the Control event.\nI then tried xbindkeys with xmacro. That sort of works, but xbindkeys is not able to capture some key combinations on my system, such as Alt + ___.\nSo I finally used Unity's own Keyboard Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts to setup my shortcut.\nAnd instead of xmacro, I have now used xvkbd program to generate the keyboard events, but that is just a personal preference. Both xmacro and xvkbd work almost the same. One additional tip is to add a delay parameter in xmacro or xvkbd to ensure that the events don't get lost.\n\nA: For me AutoKey from Software Center worked the best. It has intuitive GUI, to add new binding click New -> Phrase and\n\n\n*\n\n*Add name, click OK\n\n*At \"Phrase Settings\" section make sure the paste using is set to keyboard\n\n*Add hotkey that you want to use\n\n*Add command into text field, eg to emulate left arrow key - it'd be <left> (list of special keys is here).\n\n\nA: You could also try https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper\nIt runs in the background and actively injects mapped keycodes.\n\nWhile this adds some extra flexibility, if all you need is remap a single button and be done you could try to use xmodmap. Looks like that has already be explained in detail.\nOr write an xkb \"symbols\" file and use setxkbmap, but I wouldn't recommend that. setxkbmap can be used on a per-device basis as well.\nWriting xkb or xmodmap configurations caused trouble for me though if both devices report the same keycode, even though the configuration maps them to different characters, when pressing them simultaneously (which is the main reason why I had to write the injection tool for that)\nAnd recently I came across this solution: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/k3h9qv/remapping_keys_using_hwdb_files/\n\nA: Notice: As of 2013, Ubuntu and derivatives no longer use xmodmap, but instead use xkb. For more information see this answer. The answer below is no longer relevant for current releases.\n\nFor remapping certain keys you need two tools. First xev (command-line tool) and second xmodmap (also command-line tool). Both should be available in Ubuntu without extra installing them.\n\n*\n\n*Start terminal window and run xev. Now it's active and waits for you to press a key. Then press the key whose behaviour you want to change. i.e. PgUp.\n\n\n*xev will output some information about the pressed key. The third line is important. It should look similar to:\n state 0x10, keycode 110 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,\n\nin this example Prior is the name of the behaviour the key is assigned to at the moment, the number keycode is the internal id to recognize the key.\nNow do this with another key i.e. PgDown give this output\n state 0x10, keycode 115 (keysym 0xff56, Next), same_screen YES,\n\nHere again the interesting part for us is keycode 115 and Next - the name of the behaviour.\n\n\n*now when you want to swap the two keys use xmodmap.\n  xmodmap -e \"keycode 110 = Next\"\n\nThis changes the key with keycode 110 on your keyboard to the action Next. It's pretty simple.\nNote that if the key you are mapping should have a different meaning when used with the Shift key (for example for British keyboard layouts, Shift+2 gives quotation marks) then you can simply list the secondary command after the first. For example if you want the key with code 53 to map to backslash normally, but to the bar symbol when used with shift, you might do:\n  xmodmap -e \"keycode 53 = backslash bar\"\n\nAdditional information: The sequence of these mappings depends on the keyboard layout. It usually is Key, Shift+Key, mode_switch+Key, mode_switch+Shift+Key, AltGr+Key, AltGr+Shift+Key, but can be very different for more special layouts, like in case of the German Neo 2 one. To skip a column use NoSymbol. Here is a comprehensive list of all keysyms.\nYou can see the concrete sequence for your layout by finding it in one of the files in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/.\nNote: These change are for the active X session only and will be lost after reboot.\nWhen you want to save the changes permanently you have to run the following commands after the ones above:\nxmodmap -pke >~/.Xmodmap\n\n(it creates a file named .Xmodmap in your home directory (~))\nThen you have to create a file named .xinitrc in your home directory where you put command xmodmap .Xmodmap in.\nYou can now modify .Xmodmap and run xmodmap .Xmodmap from console to see the changes immediately. The changes in .Xmodmap will persist.\nsource: Ubuntu Foruns\nBonus stuff:\nIf the key you are remapping has different behavior depending on a state (\nlike how the keys in the numeric keyboard depend on NumLock) you simply have to do xmodmap -pm to get a list of modifiers and then do:\nxmodmap -e \"KEYCODE MODIFIER = behaviour behaviour_with_modifier\"\nSuppose, for example, that you want to get a period instead of a comma on the numeric keyboard (useful for most programmers), but you want to keep the \"delete\" behavior when NumLock is off.\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 91 mod2 = KP_Delete period\"\n\nmod2, because xmodmap -pm tells us that mod2 is Num_Lock, the other names are obtained by pressing the keys in xev.\n\nA: If you're trying to move a Shift key, there are a few extra steps:\n xmodmap -e \"keycode 62 = Up\" # Shift => Up\n xmodmap -e \"keycode 111 = Shift_R\" # Up => Shift\n xmodmap -e \"add shift = Shift_R\" # Make the new Shift key actually do shifting\n xmodmap -e \"remove shift = Up\" # Prevent the old Shift key from shifting\n xset r 62 # Make the new Up key autorepeat\n xset -r 111 # Prevent the new Shift key from autorepeating\n\n\nA: I've just had an afterthought.. I think you may mean something entirely different by \"remap\".. but I'll leave my answer as it is...  (I don't know how to re-assign one key to behave as another)\nUPDATE: my 'afterthought' has been confirmed; ( I've answered the wrong question :)... please see NES's Community Wiki answer (accepted above).\nThere are two general ways to remap rebind a key. \n\n\n*\n\n*locally to a particular program\n(a key can be used for different things in different apps/windows)  \n\n*globally for a specific user\n(a key has the same function in all windows)\n\n\nFor 'local to a program' methods, there is sometimes a way to change keybindings offered by the app itself... eg.  \nFirefox has an addon called keyconfig ... for some info see this MozillZine post \nMost Ubuntu programs are Gnome based and there is a specific utility to modify the keybinding for any menu item of these Gnome apps... It is called Editable Menu Accelerator ... It is a very 'touchy' tool, but quite powerful.. You can enable it by running gconf-editor (via Terminal or Alt+F2)... navigate to desktop--gnome--interface and select can_change_accels .... You can then change menu items to virtual anything you like (per program/window)... I suggest you disable it as soon as you've done what you need..  \nOtherwise you can set up Global hotkeys.  I use a program called xbindkeys , and there is also an option available via the Main Menu -- Preferences, called Keyboard Shortcuts \nIf you use xbindkeys, you will need to add it to your \"Startup Applications\" (Main Menu -- Preferences) ... Also (as suggested by Stefano Palazzo) I have previously written a more detailed description of xbindkeys in an answer on this askubuntu page\n\nA: Here is how I tried to switch the mapping of the ENTER key to the SHIFT key\n(and vice versa):\n$ uname -a\n\nREPORTS:\nLinux box 2.6.32-37-generic #81-Ubuntu SMP Fri Dec 2 20:35:14 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux\n\n$ which xmodmap\n\nREPORTS:\n/usr/bin/xmodmap\n\n$ which xev\n\nREPORTS:\n/usr/bin/xev\n\n$ xev\n\n(ignore the next fifty lines or so)\nPRESS THE ENTER KEY (notice the third line):\nKeyPress event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x110, subw 0x0, time 263441120, (738,242), root:(771,314),\n    state 0x0, keycode 36 (keysym 0xff0d, Return), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (0d)\n    XmbLookupString gives 1 bytes: (0d)\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x110, subw 0x0, time 263441271, (738,242), root:(771,314),\n    state 0x0, keycode 36 (keysym 0xff0d, Return), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (0d)\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nPRESS THE SHIFT KEY (notice the third line):\nKeyPress event, serial 30, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x110, subw 0x0, time 263592202, (464,368), root:(497,440),\n    state 0x0, keycode 62 (keysym 0xffe2, Shift_R), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:\n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x5600001,\n    root 0x110, subw 0x0, time 263592298, (464,368), root:(497,440),\n    state 0x1, keycode 62 (keysym 0xffe2, Shift_R), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nWhat's important is the third line of each keypress:\nFOR:\nstate 0x0, keycode 36 (keysym 0xff0d, Return), same_screen YES,\nThe name \"Return\" is the name of the behavior of the key pressed.\nThe number of the key pressed is \"36\".\n\nstate 0x0, keycode 62 (keysym 0xffe2, Shift_R), same_screen YES,\nThe name \"Shift_R\" is the name of the behavior of the key pressed.\nThe number of the key pressed is \"62\".\n\nREVERSE THE MAPPING:\n$ xmodmap -e \"keycode 62 = Return\"\n$ xmodmap -e \"keycode 36 = Shift_R\"\n\nSAVE THE RESULTS:\n$ xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap\n$ vi ~/.xinitrc\n\nADD\n xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\n$ sudo reboot\n\nThe main problem was that the reversal did NOT work.\nThe ENTER key was mapped to the SHIFT_R key; but the SHIFT_R key was not mapped to the ENTER key.

I have done many installs (40+) of Ubuntu starting with 8.10, and have never run into this. I've spent three hours trying to do a dual boot install of 10.10. \nWhen you get to the place where you normally would choose to install as a dual boot or overwrite the existing information on the hard drive, that block is just blank. Nothing. No choices even to do a manual partition setup. If you try to go on you get the message \"No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu.\" but there is nothing in the partitioning menu.  \nI tried a good 10.04 disc also. Same thing happens with it. I ran a gparted live cd, and it shows the hard drive as sda with 3 partitions on the original. sda1 is a small partition called PQService. sda2 is another small partition called System Reserved, and GParted says it is the boot partition. sda3 is the main partation with the operating system (Windows 7) and all of the empty space. There is a little unallocated space at the very beginning and very end of the hard drive. \nIf I go to places in the Live CD, it shows a 640 gb hard disk called Acer, but it also shows a 640 gb hard disk called system reserved. They are the same disk. There is just one hard drive. If you click properties in the System Reserved 640 gb, it shows all information as unknown. I had to change the boot order in the bios in order to run the live cd. The hard drive instead of being listed as such is listed as Raid:Raid Ready. Something the way this computer is set up is preventing Ubuntu from being able to identify the hard drive partitions at all to do an install, even if you were not doing a dual boot and just wanted to overwrite Windows. \nIs this a bug that needs reported? This is a major problem for me and my brother, but also for Ubuntu if new users  want to Ubuntu and find they cannot install it. \n\nA: Boot up 9.10 Live CD (I was installing 10.10)\nOpen a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get remove dmraid\n\nthen type \"y\" then enter\nNow try to install! This solved my problem and hopefully for everyone else who has this issue!\nFrom http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8225121&postcount=1 . Go to the bottom of that page and read the \"Ultimate solution\"\n\nA: i remember that i had to face some similar issues what i did was reboot the windows then select the appropriate key combination to enter the bios then look for the hard disk options. there i think that you need to change or select ide emulation. then save the changes and reboot the hard disk will response like an ide unit. after this little trick my hard disk was properly detected by the ubuntu live cd. i hope this can help some other person facing this annoying difficulty. charles izquierdo\n\nA: I ran into this problem two days ago, and before that just a few days too :D! The solution is suprisingly simple. First, ensure that windows is shut down cleanly. Start windows, right click on my computer in the start menu, click manage, and use disk management to create a new blank partition (DO NOT FORMAT IT). At this point make sure that windows is shut down cleanly. Boot into the live cd and now you should see ubuntu select this free space as you are accustomed to seeing :).\n", "Q: Deluge 100% CPU From time to time Deluge goes to 100% CPU with no apparent reason, (no active torrents). If I restart it the CPU goes to around 0%\nHas anyone else encountered that?\n\nEdit:\nLol, finally solved the bug (after some investigating). In short it appears it's caused by Deluge using twisted.internet.run() instead of gtk.main() for it's main loop, and then twisted.internet.run() calling gobject.threads_init() internally, which sets a SIGCHLD handler, and ultimately it boils down to a bug in PyGtk that is resoved by this patch:\ndiff --git a/gtk/gtk.override b/gtk/gtk.override\nindex 75018f4..94309a6 100644\n--- a/gtk/gtk.override\n+++ b/gtk/gtk.override\n@@ -1151,9 +1151,10 @@ pygtk_main_watch_check(GSource *source)\n #ifdef HAVE_PYSIGNAL_SETWAKEUPFD\n     PySignalWatchSource *real_source = (PySignalWatchSource *)source;\n     GPollFD *poll_fd = &real_source->fd;\n-    int data_size = 0;\n+    unsigned char dummy;\n+    gssize ret;\n     if (poll_fd->revents & G_IO_IN)\n-        data_size = read(poll_fd->fd, 0, 1);\n+        ret = read(poll_fd->fd, &dummy, 1);\n #endif\n     state = pyg_gil_state_ensure();\n\nNow Deluge works fine, and I understand that this patch fixes a similar bug in other programs that use PyGtk as well.\n\nA: I believe this is a bug that the Deluge developers have blamed on a GTK+ control they use for displaying files. In short the workaround is to just not use the file pane and not to use the \"open folder\" context menu option.\ndeluge-web has a separate bug that also causes high CPU but this is officially fixed in the latest version available from their website.\n\nA: The Deluge Forum has more detail about this problem, with links to bug reports and the patched debs for Natty and Maverick. \nhttp://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?p=152813#p152813\n", "Q: Avoiding backing up system-managed files I'd like to do thorough backups, but want to avoid backing up files which can be replaced via apt.\nDoes this effectively just consist of omitting /usr, with the exception of /usr/local, as well as /lib*, from the backup?\nDo some backup apps provide this functionality?\n\nA: Just back up /home (user files and settings) and /etc (system settings) - everything else can restored by reinstalling Ubuntu and installing software from the repositories.\nIf you've manually edited any other locations (this includes installing software from using other methods than package manager), you will need to back up those as well.\n\nA: The following may be excluded even if you are backing up data changed by apt in a root filesystem.\n/lost+found /media  /mnt /cdrom  /sys /tmp /proc /var/cache /dev\nNow others like /etc /boot /bin /sbin are also managed by apt. So essentially what you need to backup would be /home, /opt, /usr/local/bin, /root and if you like to keep the logs /var. If you change/edit configuration files, /etc needs to be backed up as well\n/var/cache/apt will have packages installed by you. So that needs to be backed up either using native utilities or using apt-cd\n\nA: If the system critical, a backup which allows a baremetal recovery will be great. \nRefer http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/geek-sheet-bare-metal-backup-and-recovery/8759 for a good process\nThis is good in case you want to revert to a level, not to the latest and greatest updates from Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: wget downloads corrupt JPEG file I'm trying to use wget to automatically download a wallpaper.

It's only 37 bytes too.\nIt works perfectly fine if I view or download it through Firefox.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I think it's some kind of protection against direct downloads, nothing wrong with wget (the server is sending you a transparent 1x1 GIF image).\nYou can circumvent this by using wget with the -U flag, adding the user agent string of your browser, eg.:\nwget -U \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/11.04 Chromium/11.0.654.0 Chrome/11.0.654.0 Safari/534.17\" http://static.die.net/earth/mercator/1600.jpg\nBUT: You should first ask the owner of that website if it's ok to download the content this way.

But in my experience with some modems (ZTE and Huawei) the availability to use the Broadband modem is based on the behaviour of the modem itself, which can be handled by the majority of the systems as both: broadband modem or usb CD-ROM. This is caused by the need of some vendors to include the drivers and applications in the same item.\nIn ubuntu you may try to eject the modem (which should be in the desktop or in your mounted devices area at: /media/) and after a few seconds, the item will be recognized as a modem and not a CD nor USB memory.\nIf everything happens as we expect, then you will be able to use your modem and get your connection.\nREMEMBER: Just \"eject\" the device, DON'T unmount, which shall result in the unavailability of getting access to the device.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Unallocated space with important data I used GParted to convert a primary partition to extended one after copying the data to another partition.

The following command works:\nfind -name 'myfile.*' |& grep -v \"Permission denied\"\n\nI don't understand why the ampersand needs to be put into this command, would have expected this to work but it doesn't. \nfind -name 'myfile.*' | grep -v \"Permission denied\"\n\nPlease explain the meaning of the ampersand.\n\nA: In Unix-like systems, there are two output paths that if left unmodified will send output to your screen. Standard error (or stderr) is the one that captures most failures and error conditions.\nTo pass the permission denied message in the stderr to the same output stream as \"regular output\" you must combine the two. In your example, in order for your grep -v to properly operate on it, you combine stdout (standard output) and stderr with the arcane syntax you see.\nFrom GNU Bash manual section 3.2.2 Pipelines:\n\nIf ‘|&’ is used, command1’s standard error, in addition to its\n  standard output, is connected to command2’s standard input through\n  the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |. This implicit redirection of\n  the standard error to the standard output is performed after any\n  redirections specified by the command.\n\nAlso, as geirha points out, if you want to just get rid of stderr output, you would want to do something like\nfind -name 'myfile.*' 2> /dev/null\n\nor perhaps\nfind -name 'myfile.*' 2> /tmp/errorlog\n\nAnd note that if you have strings of commands, such as a find passing its output to xargs you would need to put the entire pipeline of commands in parentheses to capture the output from all components of the command. E.g.,\n(find | egrep ^[RS].[0-9]+/.svg] | xargs head -1 )  2> /dev/null\n\nIf you left out the parentheses, and did this instead --\nfind | egrep ^[RS].[0-9]+/.svg] | xargs head -1 2> /dev/null\n\nyou would still see permission denied errors from the find or egrep, but stderr would be redirected for xargs.\nAs you've seen, you would likely throw away the stderr only after viewing its contents during a test run.\nNote that with GNU find and as far as I can tell, any POSIX-compliant find, the -print option is implicit. You can still supply it explicitly if you like.\n\nA: If you want to ignore the error messages, just redirect stderr to /dev/null.\nfind . -name 'myfile.*' -print 2>/dev/null\n\nAlso, consider reading http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind.\n\nA: Error messages are written to stderr, not stdout, but | pipes only stdout.\nYou probably want |&, which pipes stderr as well as stdout.\n", "Q: How to delete/disable GNOME panels?

As psusi has written Ubuntu chooses between Metacity and Compiz depending on your settings.\nMetacity and Compiz are just the two window managers available in Ubuntu's standard setup but there are many more available and most of them can be used with Gnome. xwinman gives a good overview on what's available and has a short explanation on the general concepts behind window managers.\n\nA: It uses one or the other depending on your settings.  If you open System -> Preferences -> Appearance and go to the visual effects tab, if you choose none then metacity is used, otherwise compiz is.\n", "Q: Is there a list, directory, or review of PPAs that is worth a look? Or can you share links to some notable PPAs that you know of or use? IMHO a list of well-maintained PPAs is a useful commodity for a Ubuntu user to have.

Or maybe you've seen a review or list of PPAs (a blog post maybe) by someone, or some kind of PPA directory, etc.?\nI am especially interested in fresh and useful packages targeting 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04.\n\nA: Have you checked out Ubuntu Tweak?

My system became very slow out of the sudden, yesterday Compiz was running extremely smooth, today it started working very slow and slowing the computer.\nWhat I've done so far was to resize my swap partition to 6 gigabytes (my computer has 3 gigabytes of RAM), before it was on 5.1 gigabytes, so I though that was the reason of this but still not.\nAlso I tested running only metacity by running metacity --replace and also with Mutter. With metacity works really great no problem but, in the other hand, with mutter the computer works slower than running compiz instead.\nI am using the Nvidia driver version 173.14.28 and my X Server version as reports the NVidia X Server Settings is the 11.0.\nMy Linux kernel running on this computer is 2.6.35-25-generic and my ubuntu version is 10.10.\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: To narrow down the likely sources of problems, create a new user (System/Administration/Users and Groups) and log in as that new user. If it works, the original problem is related to your user configuration - your compiz settings, perhaps. If it's still broken, it's a system-wide problem and presumably related to an update or something else that changed in the system. You could check what updates, if any, you installed lately.\n\nA: Although I am not using 10.10 and neither same version of kernel, but during those days when I was using 9.10 with nVidia driver and Compiz on, I do have this issue before.\nWhat I did was I choose to run nVidia with Vdpau using the following PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~nvidia-vdpau/+archive/ppa\nMake sure you backup all data before trying this. Use at own risk.\n\nA: I had a similar problem some times ago and in my case it was related to compiz version and video driver version. Are you sure you didn't updated one or the other ?\nYou could also try to start compiz from a terminal (just type compiz), that may show you some warning message that is invisible otherwise. In my case there was such message (sorry I can't exactly remember what it said) and the problem was indeed related to that.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but I today had this problem with compiz taking up all cpu resources and came to the conclusion that the reason was that I just installed gnome-panel (just gnome-panel without any dependencies/suggested applications).

Just plug it in and you're good to go. You can test it out with the simple (yet powerful) program called \"mypaint\", available in the software center.\nIf it doesn't work (usually because it's a brand new piece of hardware) it's possible that you need to update the module for wacom tablets.

Have someone got any information about this workaround?\nPlease suggest working methods, \nThanks, B. Roland\n\nA: Once your unsupported printer is recognized either from USB or if setup as network printer from the appropriate network setting you are asked for a driver. If your printer is not listed you can alway select \"Generic\" to give you a choice of standard printing methods depicted below:\n\nIn this example on the left hand side a \"PCL6/PCL XL Printer\" is selceted and gives you again a variety of selections of PCL6 subsets on the right hand side. Depending on your model your Konica/Minolta printer may be a PCL6 printer and this entry may work, but you will have to simply try out what subsets are appropriate. If it's not PCL6 you may also try out if a generic GDI driver works.\nFancy special things your printer may be capable of will not work with a generic driver but at least you can print out something.\n\nA: This is a method I used to print to a non-linux friendly Lexmark.  It should work with any Windows printer.\nWhat you need\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need a a PC or a Virtual Machine running Windows on the same network.\n\n*Make sure your printer can print from your Windows PC/VM\n\n*Download and install Ghostscript, GSview and RedMon EE onto your Windows PC\n\n\nConfiguring Windows Printing\nUsing Printers and Faxes - File - Server Properties, Add a new port and select \"Redirected Port\".

I exactly followed the steps in this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP\nyet I did not succeed; I keep getting error 403, which says that the server doesn't have permission to access the requested page. I searched forums and many suggested changing the permission of the folder. I went straight away and set the permission to 777, but that didn't solve the problem.\nI made another search and somebody gave me a clue, which is that it could be because my home folder is encrypted. I believe this could be the problem, but:\nWhat is the relation between encryption and Apache? I suppose Apache server is requesting the file from the system, rather than trying to access the file bytes!\nIs there anyway to solve this problem? I don't want to move the folder to /var/www because I am using this Apache for testing, so I want whatever change I make to be immediately reflected, rather than having to copy files which is error prone.\n\nA: What's in your error_log?  \nI don't think home folder encryption should be a problem.  I have /var/www/ symlinked to locations in my home folder, and with Options +FollowSymLinks in the site config it works just fine.\nJust a couple quick notes - you can sudo chgrp -R www-data <path>; sudo chmod -R g+a <path> instead of setting permissions to 777 - this is a good habit in general and important if you're on a shared host.\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"I want whatever change I make to be immediately reflected\" but I'm guessing you mean keeping a working copy in /home and pointing Apache at /var/www - this isn't necessary/required.  You can use ln -s like I've described above or point Apache directly at your home folder as you're trying to do.\n\nA: Once I wrote this in the next link and I hope this help you, the full thread can be reached by clicking on:\nChange the default folder for PHP testing in Linux\nhttp://ultimateeditionisrael.freeforums.org/change-the-default-folder-for-php-testing-in-israel-remix-t600.html\n\nHowever, if we wish to use another local folder for testing in our PHP code, we can change the default folder location used by our php engine to manage these files. This is done using the following procedure:\n\ngksu gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\n\nProvide user password\nThen, change all occurrences of \"/var/www/\" to the folder that we use to test our PHP. (Example: /home/geppettvs/www/ or where appropriate, change \"geppettvs\" by your local folder.\nAfter that you must restart the computer for the purpose of the changes to take effect. Do not forget also that the files must have the proper file permissions to run properly.

I am using Ubuntu 9.10 on a stationary PC. I have a secondary 1 TB harddrive with a single big logical partition (currently formatted as ext4). It is mounted as /usr3 with options user, exec in /etc/fstab.\nI am doing highspeed imaging experiments. Well, only 260fps, but that still creates many individual files since each frames is saved as one png-file. The stationary is not used by anyone other than me which is why the default security model posed by ubuntu is not necessary.\nWhat is the best way to make the entire contents of /usr3 generally available on all systems. In case I need to move the harddrive to another Ubuntu 9.x or 10.x machine? \nWhen grabbing image with the firewire camera I use a selfmade grabbing software-utility (console based) in sudo-mode. This creates all files with root as owner and group.\nI am logged in as user otb and usually I do the following when having to make files generally available to otb:\n\nsudo chown otb -R *\nsudo chgrp otb -R *\nsudo chmod a=rwx -R *\n\nThis takes some time since the disk now contains individual ~200000 files.\nAfter this, how would linux behave if I moved the harddrive to another system where the user otb is also available? Would the files still be accessible without sudo use?\n\nA: First of all, your first two commands can be combined :\nsudo chown otb:otb -R *\n\nNot sure if this will run faster however.\nSecond of all, since you don't care about security on this drive, you should mount the drive specifying a umask which makes all files 777 as they are written :\nuser,exec,umask=000\n\nThat might help prevent the need for running your third command at all.\nAdditionally, since it seems that a umask option may not be available for all filesystem types, there's another way to set the default file permissions of files created when in sudo.  This is achieved by editing /etc/sudoers.\nFrom man sudoers, the option \"umask_override\" appears to allow this.\numask_override : If set, sudo will set the umask as specified by sudoers without modification.  This makes it possible to specify a more permissive umask in sudoers than the user’s own umask and matches historical behavior.  If umask_override is not set, sudo will set the umask to be the union of the user’s umask and what is specified in sudoers.  This flag is off by default.\nI've never used this option though, so proceed carefully.  Editing /etc/sudoers can be dangerous and require a system rebuild (or live CD intervention) if you get it wrong.\n\nA: You will need to have same uid and gid for the user otb (or whatever the username is) in order to be able to access the files without sudo on a different system.\nUID (user ID) and GID (group ID) are both unique number systems assigned to users and groups. For normal users they start from 1001 onwards.\nEasiest way to ensure same permissions: In the file /etc/passwd, for any user entry, UID & GID is the third and fourth field respectively. On second system you can create a user with command from a terminal using useradd -u UID -g GID username where the UID and GID are the same UID and GID of the user otb in first system. Before issuing the command, ensure that the same UID is already not in use.\nI tried from GUI System -> Administration -> Users and Groups and could not find a way to synchronize it.\nKeeping same /etc/passwd file across systems, or using solutions like NIS, LDAP will make this much more smoother if you have more systems.\nFor more details refer to man useradd, man usermod and, if you need to delete any users, man userdel from a terminal.\n", "Q: Desktop effects could not be enabled when i try to enable visual effects. This is a VirtualBox 4.0.2 Guest \n*\n\n*I am running on a Windows 7 64 bit host.\n\n*Running VirtualBox 4.0.2\n\n*Running Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit guest.\n\n*Running VirtualBox Guest Additions 4.0.2 - I ran the 4.0.2 .run file i got from virtualbox downloads.\n\n*Compiz/Emerald are installed.\n\n\nThis is driving me crazy. This should take 20 minutes to setup. But after 4 hours i need help.\n\nA: 3D acceleration in Virtual Box still is experimental. Therefore not all combinations of hosts/guests are supported, some graphic funtions are not yet implemented, and some incompatibilites with the host graphic adapter still exist. In addition virtual emulation of a 3D graphic card consumes quite a lot of CPU power and slows down the guest system considerably.\nIn order to test 3D functionality you have to enable this manually in the settings of your virtual machine. Also a proper installation of guest additions is needed. You can test the latter in the guest Ubuntu from System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers. The guest additions driver should appear there as activated like this:\n\nIf you can't see this you need to reinstall your guest additions by running the installation script provided by the guest additions .iso file (see also this answer).\n\nA: You will need at least VirtualBox 4.0.6 to run well Ubuntu 11.04. VirtualBox only added complete support to X.org 1.10 in this version, as you check in the changelog.\nOlder versions can run into graphical problems while running Natty.\n\nA: I have the same problem with a Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop 64-bit guest running inside VirtualBox 4 on a Windows 7 64-but host. My host machine is a Sony Vaio F Series (VPCF11S1E). I have always had problems with Linux (even native installs) because of the quirky nVidia GeForce GT 330M graphics chipset.\nWhen I right-click on the desktop, select \"Change Background\", click on the \"Visual Effects\" tab and then click the \"Extra\" radio-button, it searches for a driver but always responds with: \"Desktop Effects Could Not Be Enabled\".\nI too have 3D acceleration selected and the max 128MB video RAM set.\nAny help on this would be really appreciated.\n\nA: I struggled with this as well.  I finally got it to work by updating my Windows host graphics card driver.  I was using the driver that came from Windows Update, but by going to my graphics card manufacturers website and downloading the latest driver, I was able to get 3d acceleration to work inside an Ubuntu guest.\n", "Q: How to have similar sound quality in Banshee and Rhythmbox (or Totem)? I am running Ubuntu 10.10 on an Acer Aspire 6390G. With its 5.1 embedded sound system, this laptop is good at playing music using in-built speakers. The soundcard is an HDA-Intel ALC888.\nWhen I use Rhythmbox (version 0.13.1) (or Totem) (and the in-built speakers), the sound is deep, warm, great. But with Banshee (version 1.8.0.), it is always crispy and basically of poor quality when the Banshee equalizer is disabled. I know that it is possible to fine tune Banshee sound using the equalizer, but after some time spent trying to properly adjust it without success, I decided to ask this question on askubuntu.com.\nIs there a way to get the same sound quality in Banshee as in Rhythmbox (or Totem) or keeping on adjusting Banshee equalizer is the only alternative to try to solve this problem ?\n(If the answer is the latter, is there anyone who would be kind enough to provide me his equalizer settings ?)\nThanks all for your answers.\n\nA: It happens that I was able to fix somehow this problem.\nI ran gstreamer-properties and noticed that the default output plugin was set on \"autodetect\". I looked at the available plugins and closed the gstreamer-properties windows while \"autodetect\" was still chosen as the default output plugin. When I ran Banshee, the sound was then identical to the one produced by either Rhythmbox or Totem.\nIn order to try to reproduce and understand the previous problem, I successively chose, as default output plugins, ALSA, ESD and PulseAudio Sound Server. In all cases, the sound between the three applications was strictly identical.\nCalling gstreamer-properties seems to have fix this problem.\n\nA: I always install the pulse audio volume control its official name is \"pavucontrol\", available in the software centre. With banshee playing adjust the playback volume. I find 80% improves the sound as it appears banshee and other players, always set their outputs at 100% and this distorts on my laptop.\n", "Q: Chrome is slow when opening or closing tabs Chrome works alright on my netbook except when opening and closing tabs. Opening a tab is pretty slow. Is this normal behavior or can I fix it?\nI am using the latest dev version but the problem isn't unique to a version. It's always like this.\n\nA: Well, since Google chrome opens a new processes for each new tab, it may be related to limitations of using a low powered cpu notebook in that situation.  For example, in firefox, since each new tab will run off of generally the same processes, there won't be a huge leap in resource usage when opening a new tab.  Chrome, on the other hand, uses a seperate process for each new tab or new site (depending on your configuration), and also a separate process for things like plugins for audio and flash.  As a result, opening new tabs may have a higher initial cost, which may really become evident on a low power processor like a notebook.\nPersonally, where chrome isn't a great fit, I tend to devolve back to firefox since it (currently) works on close to a single process model and will tend to be easier on resources as a result (though more prone to sites crashing your session, etc).\n\nA: Type about:flags in the address bar of chrome, and then disable \"GPU compositing on all pages\"\nThen restart Chrome for the changes to take effect.\nWhile I experienced the issue I noticed the GPU process in chrome was eating up all the memory, once I disabled this the tabs stopped hanging. Haven't had issues since.\n\nA: Do the other tabs that exist have some flash or shockwave animation running in them?\nEven I have observed the same, but none of the browsers run them it is fine.\n\nA: This can be caused by extensions.

I assume 11.04 is going to use Firefox 4, is Ubuntu going to keep using Ubuntu One sync or are they going to change over to the Firefox Sync built into 4.0?\n\nA: We will continue to use and expand the bindwood plugin we currently have.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 will probably ship with Firefox 4, which will probably come with its own built-in sync feature (the feature is and was available as an extension in 10.10 and before). Other browsers in 11.04 may also ship with their own built-in sync feature. Ubuntu One will continue to offer its bookmark sync tech independently of them, and users will continue to be able to choose the one that better suits their needs.\n", "Q: How do I bind another key to be Return? My Enter key recently broke and I was wondering if I could bind it to a different key in GNOME. Does anyone know how I would go about doing this?\n\nA: Yes, you can change the xmodmap. First thing to do is find the keycode for the key you want to use as replacement. To do that, open a terminal, then run xev in the terminal. Move the mouse pointer into the small white window that opens up, then hit the key on the keyboard that you want to use as replacement. In the terminal you should now see a KeyPress event and a KeyRelease event. Make a note of the keycode number it shows, then close the white xev window.\nNow, if you don't already have a ~/.Xmodmap file, create one with the current mapping by running\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap\n\nThen edit the file with your favorite editor. e.g.  gedit ~/.Xmodmap.\nScroll down to the line for the keycode you noted earlier. If the keycode you want to use is 62 for instance, change the line that starts with keycode  62 = to read:\nkeycode  62 = Return NoSymbol Return\n\nNext time you log in, you'll be asked if you want to load that modmap, so do that, and afterwards that key should work as a return key. For making the change in your current session, load the file with:\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\n", "Q: Link Windows Mobile Device with Ubuntu and Use Laptop to send SMS Is there any software that i can use on my ubuntu laptop to write SMS on my Windows Mobile 6.1 HTC Touch Diamond?\n\nA: gammu and it's GUI wammu might help with any phone!\n\nA: It should be possible to combine SynCE tools and the WinCE SMS program for sending SMS messages.\nhttp://www.synce.org/moin/SynceTools\nYou'll see that there is a command for running programs on your wince phone. And if you can figure out what the SMS tool is called, you should be able to call the program and send a message using it. If you can't, you may have to write one yourself; see this blog.\nOverall, Windows Mobile phones aren't supported natively in Ubuntu and you need to get in touch with the developers of SynCE to get functionality if you want it to be easier to use or integrated with other systems or phones.\n", "Q: How to run a script when a specific flash-drive is mounted? Is there a way to run a script when a particular USB device is mounted?\nI keep my videos on a separate USB and would like to run a script that would mount the video folder on the USB device to the one in the home folder.\n\nA: Another way to get the values for ATTRS{idVendor} and ATTRS{idProduct} (tested in Ubuntu 12.04) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find where your usb is mounted:\n$ mount | grep /dev/sd*\n\nthis shows something like the following:\n/dev/sdb on /media/SOMEDIR type vfat ...\n\n\n*Use udevadm to get that device info:\nudevadm info -q all -n /dev/sdb | grep -E -i -w '.*VENDOR_ID.*|.*MODEL_ID.*'\n\nthe output should be something like:\nE: ID_MODEL_ID=001a\nE: ID_VENDOR_ID=002b\n\n\n*Now use the model id for ATTRS{idProduct} and vendor id for ATTRS{idVendor}\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"002b\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"001a\" ...\n\n\nA: There's much nicer solution with systemd now. You create a service which depends and is wanted by you media e.g.: /etc/systemd/system/your.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=My flashdrive script trigger\nRequires=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\nAfter=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/home/you/bin/triggerScript.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\n\nThen you have to start/enable the service:\nsudo systemctl start your.service\nsudo systemctl enable your.service\n\nAfter mount, systemd fires your trigger script. The advantage over udev rule is that the script really fires after mount, not after adding system device.    \nUse case: I have an encrypted partition which I want to backup automatically. After adding the device I have to type in the password. If I hooked the backup script to udev, the script attempts to run at the time when I'm typing password, which will fail.\nResource: Scripting with udev\nNote: You can find your device unit with:\nsystemctl list-units -t mount\n\n\nA: Start by finding your device in lsusb. Note the ID (eg 0a81:0101)\nCreate a new udev rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ via sudoedit /etc/udev/rules.d/100-mount-videos.rulesand plonk a new rule in there like this:\nACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0a81\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0101\", RUN+=\"/home/your_username/bin/mount_videos.sh\"\n\nNote how I used the ID from lsusb.\nThen you just need to write the script to do the work. A simple mount command should work. You might need a sleep 5 command in there to wait for the filesystem to initialize (if you leave gnome to do the main mounting -- but you're free to mount it first and then you might not need the sleep).\nAddition from Allan: Long running scripts might block \"all further events for this or a dependent device\".  My Mint man page further states \"Long running tasks need to be immediately detached from the event process itself.\"  No tip is given on where to gain the skill to do this.\nReply from Oli: Wrap it like so: https://askubuntu.com/a/106359/449\n\nA: In Nautilus under Edit>Preferences>Media you can choose \"other action\" and than \"custom command\" for different kinds of scripts/commands to be executed. By that time the usb drive is already mounted, but I suppose you could still link it (with a custom command) to the folder you want the drive to appear in.\nI couldn't tell whether this is easier or better than using udev. \n\nA: If you don't want to interfere with your filemanager (nautilus, konquerer, gnome, etc) 's control over mounting and unmounting your device, I suggest not going the udev route.\nInstead, use udisks-glue if your system uses udisks (almost all do).\nAfter installing, just create a config file ~/.udisks-glue.conf in your home directory like this.\nMy following example updates GPS-Assist data on my camera everytime I plug in the SD-card.\nfilter BT16EXTREME {\n  optical = false\n  partition_table = false\n  usage = filesystem\n  label = BT16EXTREME\n}\nmatch BT16EXTREME {\n  post_mount_command = \"/home/bernhard/update-gps-assist-data.pl %mount_point\"\n}\n\nAfterward just make sure udisks-glue starts when you boot or log-in. I.e. via gnome's startup applications\n\nA: @sumid's answer has a problem. You should not start the service. You just need to enable it. \nfile: /etc/systemd/system/your.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=My flashdrive script trigger\nRequires=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\nAfter=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/any_path_even_inside_the_mount_point/script.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=media-YourMediaLabel.mount\n\nThen enable the service:\nsudo systemctl enable your.service\n\nThat's all. \nNote: You can find your medial label with: sudo systemctl list-units -t mount\nNote2: If the service is failed somehow (for example, the script is not executable), your mount point will change to <old_mount_point_name>1 next time you mount the usb device.

I can issue the clear command or press Ctrl + L to clear the current Ubuntu terminal, but this just shifts previous output upwards and if you use mouse scroll or PgUP and PgDown keys it's hard to distinguish where the output of previous command ends and output of current command begins.\nIs there a way to really clear the terminal so I won't see previous command results?\n\nA: Here are all the ways you can clear the terminal screen in Unix:\nclear               # only clear visible screen\nclear && clear      # clear buffer as well\ntput clear          # same as clear but by sending escape seq\nreset               # clear + reset internal terminal state + 1sec delay\ntput reset          # same as reset but without 1sec delay\nstty sane           # don't clear screen but reset some terminal options\necho -e \"\\033c\"     # same as tput reset but hardcoded escape seq\nprintf \"\\033c\"      # same as tput reset but hardcoded escape seq\nsetterm -reset      # same as tput reset, setterm has friendlier commands\n\n\nA: Yes, the command you're looking for is\nreset\n\nIn contrast to clear, or Ctrl+L, reset will actually completely re-initialise the terminal, instead of just clearing the screen. However, it won't re-instantiate the shell (bash). That means that bash's state is the same as before, just as if you were merely clearing the screen.\nAs @Ponkadoodle mentions in the comments, this command should do the same thing more quickly:\ntput reset\n\n\nFrom the other answers:\n\n*\n\n*You can set a Keyboard Shortcut to reset the terminal, as explained by towolf.\n\n\n*If you're running Kubuntu, and your terminal is Konsole, you need to go to Edit → Clear history, since reset doesn't work the same way there, as UncleZeiv notes.\n\nA: You can also assign a shortcut in gnome-terminal by going to Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts. I useShift+Ctrl+Alt+C.\n\n\nA: Well it really depends, if you are using Konsole for instance even reset doesn't prevent you to scroll past the first line. In that case you have to use some feature of the particular terminal you are using. For Konsole, it's Edit > Clear History.\n\nA: I have found the following to be quite successful with Kubuntu:\nalias clc=\"echo -en '\\033c\\033[3J'\"\n\nYou can use cls to keep with the Windows tradition, use the Matlab version clc, or one of your own. Good luck!\n\nA: If you're using yakuake or Konsole, try\nCtrl+Shift+K.\nSource: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309008\n\nA: Alternatively to reset, you can do echo -e \"\\033c\", or have in your .bashrc, something like alias cls=\"echo -ne '\\033c'\"\nThe UNIX/Linux StackExchange, has a thread on this: How to clear terminal completely? (unix.stackexchange.com), as well as SuperUser : Clear terminal using keyboard shortcut (superuser.com).\n\nA: Another alternative to the @Hibou57 answer:\n# The Octal Way\nalias clear=\"echo -e '\\033c\\c'\"\n\nOR\n# The Hex Way\nalias clear=\"echo -e '\\x1b\\c'\"\n\nBasically this will have exactly the same effect, it will print the ^[ character (which clear your terminal) and does not output the trailing new line.\n\nA: Cross posting my answer from stackoverflow.\nUse the following command to do a clear screen instead of merely adding new lines ...\nprintf \"\\033c\"\n\nyes that's a 'printf' on the bash prompt.\nYou will probably want to define an alias though...\nalias cls='printf \"\\033c\"'\n\nExplanation\n\\033 == \\x1B == 27 == ESC\n\nSo this becomes <ESC>c which is the VT100 escape code for resetting the terminal.

This can also be printf \"\\033c\" or printf \"\\x1bc\". That is an ansi escape sequence that miraculously clears the screen and buffer for the terminal output (for most standard terminals I have worked in it seems - I know it works in such as gnome-terminal, terminator, xterm, etc. on Ubuntu-like Linuxes)\nI know this works in Linux Mint and Ubuntu 14.04, so I don't know why people are appending and prepedning things like clear && echo -ne \"\\033c. printf \"\\ec\" has always worked for me.\nAdditionally, in my .bashrc I have a binding like this:\nbind -x '\"\\C-t\": printf \"\\ec\"';\n\nNow I press ctrlt all the time.\n", "Q: How can I read man pages in my native language?

I was hoping someone could recommend a good password generator.\nExtra props to the person who can name one that gives you a mnemonic to remember it as well.\n\nA: The results are more hideous even than apg or pwgen (even with the -s option set), but this is more fun: \nhead -c 8192 /dev/urandom  |   strings --bytes 8 | sed 's/\\s//'\n\nI suspect your use case if different, but this kind of thing is useful for shared secret keys, and other kinds of passwords that you don't type in very often.\nTo get a larger selection, pass more bytes to head, and to get longer password result strings, modify --bytes in strings (which gives a minimum length).  the sed expression strips out strips out spaces and tabs (represented by  \\s). \nHowever, you will at some point probably appreciate applications (like pwgen, KeePassX or LastPass) that give you an option to avoid easily confusable characters, like 1 and l and I .  These can look like 1Il or 1Il or worse. You would want to use an option like this if you are resetting someone's password or giving a one-time passkey that needs to be communicated.\nStil, pwgen put gives this caveat in its man page, describing its -B option: \n   -B, --ambiguous\n          Don't use characters that could be confused  by  the  user  when\n          printed,  such  as 'l' and '1', or '0' or 'O'.

You probably know when this is useful or not.   And it's certainly better than using 'Pa$$w0rD' for everything.  If in doubt, create a longer password, or pass your generated password as input to another generator, or use multi-factor authentication.   \n\nA: pwgen   generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords.

I want to know how to install Ubuntu on a Dell Inspiron 15R with Intel Core i3, 3GB RAM, Intel HD graphics and 320GB HDD. I've heard some people have had issues with the wireless card. Also, I tried a few days ago to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 10.10 and the installaten hung on the \"Who are you\" screen... Can anyone help me, I really want to get into Linux but without having any problems with the laptops drivers.\n\nA: Boot in to a live CD and validate if everything including wireless working or not. That is the best way to validate driver support before you install. If there is small problems, you can try to resolve them after final install.\n\nA: I did recently install ubuntu on an inspiron. I don't know if it was 15R but it had  core2duo. Wireless was an issue where I needed to install lpphy installer rather than default restricted driver which can be found in synaptic. I myself own a Dell Vostro 3400 with 4GB RAM and i3 processor. Everything runs smooth as silk apart from touchpad two finger scrolling. But IMO, ubuntu should run smoothly.\n\nA: According to this Ubuntu page : \n\nThe Dell Inspiron 15R laptop has been\n  awarded the status of Certified on\n  Ubuntu 64-bit PC (x86_64).\n\nIn other words, this should work.  A google search did turn up a number of issues and solutions.   \nHere is one question and resolution from askubuntu regarding the video driver : \nCan't install on Dell Inspiron 15R\nHere's a page addressing wireless problems in particular: http://www.downloadatoz.com/driver/articles/get-the-wi-fi-working-on-dell-inspiron-15r-laptop-with-ubuntu-10-04.html .\nThat might be worth trying if firmware-b43-lpphy-installer from sagarchalise's answer doesn't work. \nAnecdotally, I've never had a serious issue running Ubuntu (or Linux generally) on Dell hardware.  My own inexperience has been on ~7 or 8 desktops and laptops over 10 years.\nSometimes I've been happier with the hardware than others, but I've had good luck.\n\nA: I also did install Ubuntu (try both 11.04 & 11.10) on dell inspiron 15r (n5110) intel i5 sandy bridge witg 4gb of ram. The problem is with the Nvidia GT 525m gpu driver, and use to install nvidia-current from repo. When I activate the driver unity turn to 2d with poor desktop effect. The problem is solved if I don't activate the driver but I would be better if I could use it.\n\nA: I run Ubuntu 11.10 on my inspiron 15R.  I use it every day for work and everything has been fine.  I have even swapped out the drive with a solid state one and it still works.  The only problem I have had is getting the video driver working correctly but may need to try to run the latest video.  By not working I mean that Unity 2D works, but I can't get Unity 3D, while it doesn't stop me, there are a few things I really miss like compiz grid.\n\nA: trust me you will have no problems with the install i have a hp laptop (granted is not a dell) with a lot of the same features as your dell except for the processor type. ubuntu 10.10 64 bit installed just fine. initially linux was created for a business environment with a need for security, which is why it asks you for a username is kind of a throw back to that. if for what ever reason your drivers dont initially work when install is coplete you can go to system> administration> additional drivers and it will install all remaining drivers\n\nA: I am typing this comment using a ubuntu installed dell inspiron 15R :D . So please install ubuntu in your inspiron.(it is very much better than windows) \nAll the drivers are FULLY compatible except NVIDIA gt525(As you don't have this card installed.... no probs at all) and alps touch pad. Touch pad gestures will not function in your ubuntu installation.\nI think as you have a 3GB of RAM it is better and suitable to install 32bit version instead of 64bit version.\n", "Q: How do I connect my Sixaxis Playstation3 controller to my laptop?

I want the backup partition automounted on boot.  But I don't want the two test partitions automounted.  Despite my use of \"noauto\" in /etc/fstab, something (gnome?) seems to be mounting them when I plug the drive it.\nLABEL=mybook            /srv/backup     ext4    defaults        0       2\nLABEL=mybook-root       /media/mybook-root ext4    user,noauto  0       2\nLABEL=mybook-spare      /media/mybook-spare ext4   user,noauto  0       2\n\nIn previous Ubuntu distributions it seems that it was possible to configure gnome so it would avoid mounting particular partitions on removable drives like USB:\ngnome-mount --write-settings --mount-options noauto --device /dev/sda1\n\nThis is no longer available in Lucid (when did it go away?)\nIs there another way to do this now?\n\nA: for this purpose I'm using the following line in /etc/fstab and i've not done any modification in gnome...  it works in ubuntu 11.04\n# Prevent mounting specific partition on external hd\nUUID=57f8f4bc-abf4-0000-675f-946fc0f9f25b none ext4 ro,noauto\n\nthere are two differences between my fstab and yours:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use partition UUID instead of LABEL\n\n*I set 'none' as mount point\n\n\nI don't know which is the difference that makes my config working, but I'd bet the second one..\n(if you want to get the UUID of the partition you can use the command sudo blkid)\n\nA: gnome-mount was replaced at some point by gvfs-mount, and the use case described in the original question seems to no longer be supported in gnome.\nSo here is a workaround, following on the experience described by @clemmy.  It involves simply listing a nonexistent directory as the mount point for partitions you don't wan't to be automatically mounted.  E.g. in this case, it would work to simply delete the relevant directories listed in the fstab, e.g. \"/media/mybook-spare\".  Unfortunately, when the user does want to mount that partition, it of course requires that the user re-create the directory (or edit the fstab).\n\nA: 1) Start up your respective partition manager depending on the desktop enviroment installed: Gparted for gnome or KDE Partition Manager for kde\n2) Under devices select the flash drive that you want to modify\n3) Right-click on the flash partition that you don't want to auto-mount, and set it with \"hidden\" flag property \n", "Q: How to disable window caption bar in GNU Screen? I usually split my GNU Screen into four regions, and I don't really need the status bars for each of those windows.\nIs there an option to disable GNU Screen window status bars?\nI could only find caption always|split only in the manual.\nThanks :)\n\nA: You can't disable it to get back some more screen real estate, but you can change its colour so that it \"disappears\"...\nAdd the following to your .screenrc:\ncaption string \"%{kk}XXXXXXX\"\n\nSo, how does this work? Well assuming your screen terminal background is black, you are making the caption strings background and foreground black as well. \"k\" stands for black, the first is for the foreground and the second one is for the background. The \"XXXXXX\"s are simply a string to make it work.\nI guess if you have chosen a different background colour for your main terminal, you simply change kk to whatever colour you have chosen.

Next I would check which version of Compiz you have installed this post from the Compiz forums is probably what is happening in your case basicaly the packages are still for 8.04 and havent been updated to 10.04 the solution was to check for any 8.04 sources in your sources list and remove then purge compiz and reinstall from the correct sources.\nHope this helps.\nPlease tell us how you get on. \n", "Q: Updating HP Pavilion BIOS from Linux I have a HP Pavilion dv6000 series (dv6602 au) laptop. I want to upgrade BIOS. I only have Ubuntu installed in my system. Is it possible to upgrade BIOS from Ubuntu? Google search gave me some results but somewhere I read that recent updates are done from inside Windows installation and not with a floppy. \n\nA: This is a detailed guide to flash a bios using ubuntu.\n\nA: Updating a BIOS from Ubuntu is only possible if the hardware manufacturer provides a custom tool that runs with Ubuntu or Linux.\nIf this is (likely) not the case then you need a BIOS update tool that is installed on a bootable external device (e.g. CD-ROM). In the best case an .iso file that can be written on your stick or CD from Ubuntu can be downloaded. Sadly, generating a bootable device is often done again from a Windows utility that does not run in Ubuntu. If you are lucky the manufacturer provides a DOS-based BIOS update utility that you can run after booting into DOS (or FreeDOS).\nHP offers a utility to update BIOS from a bootable CD-R, however AFAIK this CD needs to be generated from within Windows. In this case, and if you are unable to extract the CD's image from the data provided otherwise, you unfortunately will have to burn your bootable BIOS update medium on another machine that runs Windows.\nBIOS downloads from HP are restricted and require regsitration to their site.

Can you help me?\n\nA: Maybe in ~/.playonlinux/wineprefix/Microsoft\\ Office\\ 2007/dosdevices/c:/Program\\ Files/Microsoft\\ Office\\ 2007 ?\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*open the software manager, install wine \n\n*check to see if both wine and playonlinux are up to date from the Q\n\n*when the window saying that office was installed, don't click the finish or close button on the office window, wait until playonlinux has finished installing\nplayonlinux will prompt you with \"do you want to add on your desktop or in your menu\".\n\n*If success you will see an icon in the play on linux window and from the menu in other and in wine \n\nA: It must have promoted you for a menu item if it was created you can acces it from Applications -> PlayOnLinux -> ms office .\n\nA: With PlayOnLinux, you have to make the shortcuts manually when you set up the wine prefix and install the programs. You do this when you install it. After you run the installation program you are asked if you want to make a shortcut. Answer in the affirmative and you will have to choose which \".exe\" file the shortcut will refer to, and the shortcuts name. Then the process will loop, in case you want to add extra shortcuts. Once done, the shortcuts will appear in the menus (if you specified it) and the PlayOnLinux list with a googly eyes icon (dont ask why)\n", "Q: Software installed on root partition or on home partition I am planning to install some big softwares such as Matlab (4GB), Mathematica (4GB) on my Ubuntu partitions.\nI was wondering\n\n\n*\n\n*if I installed them on my home\npartition, when I reinstall Ubuntu\nwithout touching the home partition,\nwill the softwares still be runnable\nafter reinstallation?\n\n*what are the advantage and\ndisadvantages of installing\nsoftwares on root partition and of\non home partition?\n\n*with your answer to the previous\nquestions, what are some reasonable\nplans for the sizes of root\npartition and of home partition?\nNote that I would like to learn\nprogramming in C, C++, Java, Python,\nLisp, databases under both Ubuntu\nand Windows, and no games. My laptop\nhas around 230 GB, where I plan to\ninstall both Windows and Ubuntu, and\nreserve 40 GB for Ubuntu (three\npartitions: swap, root and home),\n110 GB for NTFS partition shared\nbetween the two OSes, 70 GB for\nWindows OS partition, and 10 GB that\ncan be added to any of the above\npartitions. I will change my plan\naccording to your suggestions.\n\n\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: I will try to answer your questions in the order you asked them:\n\n\n*\n\n*It depends on how Matlab and Mathematica are distributed; if they are distributed as static binaries, then you should be okay. A static binary has any of the libraries needed by the program compiled into them. Generally, this is not the default for compiled applications, as it leads to extremely large binaries.\n\n*There really aren't any disadvantages, per say; it depends on the application. If you're installing an application from apt-get, Synaptic or from the Ubuntu Software Centre, the application is being installed in your root partition. If you have a static binary that you have downloaded and unpackaged yourself, then your best bet would be to keep it in your home directory. For any scripts or programs I write or install, that are not provided by the Ubuntu repositories, I keep them in a bin directory in my home folder. This way, they aren't \"polluting\" my base system.\n\n*The size of your root partition really depends on how many applications and libraries you plan on installing from the Ubuntu repositories. Different Linux distributions recommend different sizes. If you allow Ubuntu to automatically partition your drive, with a separate partition for /home, the Ubuntu installer will give you a sane layout. C and C++ compilers, Lisp REPLs, Python interpreters and the various databases do not take up much room. The only large compiler is for Java; I believe it weighs in at around 80MB for the JDK (Java Development Kit). As with my answer for your second question, most of the stuff you write, you should keep to your home directory, so you do not pollute the base system. Plus, if you ever upgrade your Ubuntu install, you will not have to worry about accidentally blowing away the directory you keep your projects in. Granted, you run this risk anyways, it will just be easier to keep everything you do in your home directory; that is what it is there for.\n", "Q: Why does ls -lh give me ls: invalid option -- 'h' I'm using Interpid (I know I need to upgrade).

The Pageant tool load private keys for prolonged usage, so you won't have to load the keys (as well as heir passprhases, if there are any), each time anew. \nHow could you achieve this in Ubuntu, and especially the Ubuntu CLI?\n\nA: Here are two utilities you should run one after the other.\nThe first evaluates for the private key you already used to authenticate into the server.\nThe second loads this key to the memory. \nThis way you could login anytime and anywhere in the current session, if the public key has been added to .ssh/authorized_keys*:\neval $(ssh-agent)\nssh-add\n\n\nHow it works:\nssh-agent is the authentication agent itself, whereas ssh-add is used to add your private keys to this agent.\nYou execute ssh-agent as an evaluation for your private key and then use the ssh-add command to actually add your private keys to this agent, for prolonged usage.\n", "Q: Facebook and Gmail stop working after 10 minutes I have problems with facebook and gmail only: It works fine and lets me log in, view the content, read new messages, etc. But after 5-10 minutes it doesn't load at all:\n\nThis webpage is not available.\nThe webpage at\n  http://www.facebook.com/ might be\n  temporarily down or it may have moved\n  permanently to a new web address. \nMore information on this error Below\n  is the original error message\nError 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET):\nUnknown error\n\n\nAfter deleting cookies this problem disappears for 5-10 minutes, then I get the same error.

Then, the moment that gmail or facebook shows the error, ALT-TAB to your terminal window and watch the next update for any changes.  I'm guessing that these sites have load balancers in place that are changing the IP addresses behind the scenes.  It's possible that your ISP is caching the content without your knowledge and your cookie is becoming invalid because the content being provided by your ISP is no longer a match for the connection being made by your browser.\n\nYou might be able to circumvent this by changing your DNS servers.  Try right clicking on nm-applet, then choose \"Edit Connections\".  Choose your ethernet connection (probably \"auto eth0\"), then \"Edit\".  Go to the IPv4 settings and change \"Automatic DHCP\" to \"Automatic DHCP (addresses only)\".\n\nAll your going to change is the DNS entries - either use Google's entries (enter 8.8.8.8, 4.4.4.4), or OpenDNS (enter 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220)\nI suppose the other option for possibly circumventing such a time-out is to run Gmail over https.

To set Gmail to use https, go to your account settings at the top-right of the page, then in the General tab, find the \"Use HTTPS\" option and select it.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Firefox.

I want to use UbuntuOne in my own Python application. I want to access contacts and maybe store other data. But I could not find any documentation or (Python) examples. How can I use this?\n\nA: There are a number of different ways of working with your Ubuntu One data, you'll be pleased to hear.\nIf your Python application is running on Ubuntu\nYour contacts data is stored in Ubuntu One, and is also synced to your desktop. Contacts data is available in the desktopcouch storage system. You can find out more about desktopcouch in the documentation.  There will be more information available over the next few months as part of the Ubuntu One app developer programme.\nA short summary: desktopcouch is your own personal CouchDB, running on your Ubuntu desktop, and your contacts are stored in it. So you can use the desktopcouch.records library to get access to your contacts:\nfrom desktopcouch.records.server import CouchDatabase\nCONTACT_RECORD_TYPE = 'http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktopcouch/contact'\ndb=CouchDatabase('contacts')\ncontact_names = []\nfor row in db.get_records(record_type=CONTACT_RECORD_TYPE):\n    first_name = row.value.get('first_name', '')\n    last_name = row.value.get('last_name', '')\n    contact_names.append('%s %s' % (first_name, last_name))\nprint contact_names\n\nThere are more examples of how to work with desktopcouch data in the desktopcouch documentation page. The data format for contacts is defined here.\nYou can create any other databases that you like in desktopcouch; simply do\ndb = CouchDatabase(\"my_new_db\", create=True)\n\nand then work with that database; your new database will be synchronised to your personal cloud and to all your machines, and you can store whatever data in it you want.\nIf your Python application is not running on Ubuntu, or you want to access the data at Ubuntu One directly\nYour data is stored in your own personal CouchDB in the cloud at Ubuntu One as well as in desktopcouch on your Ubuntu desktop. You can access it directly in your personal cloud if you choose. You'll need to be familiar with OAuth for this. First, obtain an OAuth token for Ubuntu One; you can do this from an Ubuntu desktop by looking in the keyring. Next, OAuth sign a request to https://one.ubuntu.com/api/account/ which will return some JSON, including your \"couchdb_root\", which will look like https://couchdb.one.ubuntu.com/u/abc/efg/12345. \nYour personal cloud contacts database is then available at https://couchdb.one.ubuntu.com/u%2Fabc%2Fefg%2F12345%2Fcontacts (it's your couchdb_root with \"contacts\" on the end, and the / escaped to %2F). You can then work with this as with any CouchDB by OAuth-signing your curl requests to it. The CouchDB guide explains how to work with CouchDB over HTTP.\nWorking with notes is a little more complicated: the primary store for notes is the Tomboy application. Tomboy will sync your notes to Ubuntu One, and they are available in your personal cloud CouchDB (a database called \"notes\"), and that \"notes\" DB is also synced into desktopcouch. However, if your application is running on the Ubuntu desktop, I'd recommend that you use Tomboy's comprehensive D-Bus API to work with your notes directly at the source, rather than editing the desktopcouch copies and waiting for those changes to be synced up to Ubuntu One and then down to Tomboy again! This Ars Technica article explains some of how to do that, and the Tomboy team are lovely people who will be eager to help.\nWe (Ubuntu One) are building up an application developer programme to make it even easier to answer this sort of question and provide guidance and documentation; I'd love to hear what you're planning to do and how I can make it easier for you, so do please drop me a line (stuart.langridge @ canonical.com, or http://kryogenix.org/contact) if I can help, or post more questions to askubuntu!\n\nA: If you want to see some sample code that runs on osx (although is cross platform), please see https://github.com/ddimmich/unbuntuone-python/ - this downloads/updates files from ubuntu one and uses oauth etc.  Its still in the early stages but it demonstrates the oauth process, stores your access token and and happily downloads files.\n", "Q: chkrootkit says /sbin/init is infected, what does that mean? I recently ran chkrootkit and got the following line:\nSearching for Suckit rootkit...                   Warning: /sbin/init INFECTED\n\nWhat does this mean exactly? I heard this was a false positive, what is exactly happening.\nPlease and thank you.\n\nA: It's likely this is a false positive since there's a bug in chkrootkit (supposedly fixed in a later version 0.50-3ubuntu1). Apparently chkrootkit doesn't perform a rigorous enough check.\nSee:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chkrootkit/+bug/454566\nAdditionally you could try rkhunter which is similar to chkrootkit.\nSome more information:\nFortunately, running file `which chkrootkit` shows us that chkrootkit is just a shell script so we can inspect it directly.\nSearching for Suckit in the file /usr/sbin/chkrootkit we find:\n   ### Suckit\n   if [ -f ${ROOTDIR}sbin/init ]; then\n      if [ \"${QUIET}\" != \"t\" ];then printn \"Searching for Suckit rootkit... \"; fi\n      if [ ${SYSTEM} != \"HP-UX\" ] && ( ${strings} ${ROOTDIR}sbin/init | ${egrep} HOME  || \\\n              cat ${ROOTDIR}/proc/1/maps | ${egrep} \"init.\" ) >/dev/null 2>&1\n        then\n        echo \"Warning: ${ROOTDIR}sbin/init INFECTED\"\n      else\n         if [ -d ${ROOTDIR}/dev/.golf ]; then\n            echo \"Warning: Suspect directory ${ROOTDIR}dev/.golf\"\n         else\n            if [ \"${QUIET}\" != \"t\" ]; then echo \"nothing found\"; fi\n         fi\n      fi\n   fi\n\nThe key line is:\ncat ${ROOTDIR}/proc/1/maps | ${egrep} \"init.\"\n\nSince recent versions of Ubuntu, running that command does produce some output (need to run as root or sudo) :\n# sudo cat /proc/1/maps | egrep \"init.\"\nb78c2000-b78db000 r-xp 00000000 08:02 271571     /sbin/init (deleted)\nb78db000-b78dc000 r--p 00019000 08:02 271571     /sbin/init (deleted)\nb78dc000-b78dd000 rw-p 0001a000 08:02 271571     /sbin/init (deleted)\n\nHowever, this is not an infection by a rootkit. I have also looked at the rkhunter code, and the checks are far more rigorous (testing for all sorts of additional files installed by the rootkit).\nI have changed lines 1003,1004 in chkrootkit file not to check perform the check of /proc/1/maps (remember to take a copy first) \nif [ ${SYSTEM} != \"HP-UX\" ] && ( ${strings} ${ROOTDIR}sbin/init | ${egrep} HOME  ) \\\n             >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: On Kubuntu 13.04 as of 2013-07-31\nRunning:\ncat /sbin/init | egrep HOME\n\nProduces:\nBinary file (standard input) matches\n\nAND\nRunning:\ncat /proc/1/maps | egrep \"init.\"\n\nProduces NO output.\nNote: Removing the period produces output (changing \"init.\" to \"init\")\nb7768000-b779f000 r-xp 00000000 08:02 399192     /sbin/init\nb779f000-b77a0000 r--p 00036000 08:02 399192     /sbin/init\nb77a0000-b77a1000 rw-p 00037000 08:02 399192     /sbin/init\n\nSo it appears to me that the part checking HOME is the problem.\nIf one can make the assumption that rkhunter has a valid check, then perhaps the easy route is just to remove this section from chkrootkit and run both rkhunter and chkrootkit?\n", "Q: Which program is stealing my keyboard events?

When I use the VT (CTRL+ALT+F1),it will only display replacement characters for chinese, but from the alternative installation CD I can see, that it's actually possible to display chinese in the VT.

I really like the idea of hard links and how they are handled. But I can’t find the best workflow. Currently I keep my snapshots on the same partition and will copy the newest snapshot to a pen-drive at the end of the week.\nCloud storage is what I’m looking for. Dropbox doesn’t fit my needs, because there is no way to make Dropbox respect hard links — all snapshots are treated as full snapshots.\nRenting a server is pretty expensive, so my question is, are there better alternatives for backup in the cloud? I would like to benefit from hard links and send only incremental backups, just like I do with my local host.\n\nA: You run rsnapshot on the remote server, it rotates the snapshots using hard links and rsyncs your files from your local machine over ssh. \nrsync only sends over the changes so your bandwidth use is minimised, rsnapshot on the server manages the hardlinks to minimise disk space.\nWhat the best cloud solution is depends upon how much disk space you need and other things \n\nA: Symlinking inside cloud storage is just going to create a copy, not a link, so you're only going to benefit from rsnapshot if you tar the target directory before uploading it.\nI admit, I haven't tried this before.  You'd have to tar the file in a way that tar's the hardlink as a hardlink and not the file itself (or you'll just end up with another full backup, only compressed).\nI'd take a look at man tar and see if it can be done.  For example, it appears that the --hard-dereference (follow hard links; archive and dump the files they refer to), is off by default, so as long as you don't specify it, then your tar dump of the latest rsnapshot should be incremental.\n\nA: I would consider using duplicity. It does basically this, by making TAR backup files and uploading to WebDAV or CloudFiles (SWIFT-style API) systems.\nhttp://duplicity.nongnu.org/\n", "Q: How to disable a touchpad on an Acer Travelmate 6492?

Can I set up somewhere in Windows system settings to temperately eliminate the file and similar ones (because there are many similar files under the same directory which I guess will also stand in the way of shrinking and unmovable by defrag)?\n\nA: The old fashioned way before Windows finally came up with their own resize tool: gparted.  Best done from the live cd.\n\nA: Just had the same problem, but the instructions in Working around Windows' \"Shrink Volume\" inadequacies worked well for me. (The title mentions Vista, but it worked well for Windows 7 too.)\nIt's a bit long to repeat here, but the main points are\n\n\n*\n\n*Close every program you can (any file currently in use is treated as unmovable, including browser cache files)\n\n*Run the Windows Disk Cleanup Wizard\n\n*Disable pagefile, kernel memory dump, system restore and hibernation (the primary system level unmovable files)\n\n*Run a defragmenter that can move files to the start of the disk\n\n\nOn a 60 GB SSD with about 35 GB free space, \"Shrink Volume\" in Windows 7 initially freed a paltry 100 MB, but following the steps in the article it was able to free the whole 35 GB.\nSee also the ubuntuguide.org documentation on multiple OS installation.\n\nA: There's a great defrag utility for Windows that can move all the files to the front of the disk, as well the little bit of space used between files (interstice problem): dirms (dirms-cl).\nRunning the defrag in safe mode may help with the unmovable file.

None worked (Raxco, Ultradefrag, Win7 defragger). Finally I used MiniTools Partition Wizard (free for home use) which 'knows' about Win7 and does not mess up the Win installation. From what I have read, GParted (which I know and love) seriously risks screwing things royally, and I could not take the risk. Partition Wizard seems a very slick program, BTW.

This is a bug, and I believe it is fixed (the person who would know is not working today, and I can't find the bug; I'll edit this answer when I get the info), but in any case, none of your work should be lost: when the situation arises, your document should be simply renamed. You should find that there are a bunch of files that start with the same name as your document, and have a .u1conflict and a number added at the end. The largest number would correspond to the last version of your file.\nIf this is not the case, and you can't find any .u1conflict files, please file a bug.

Although I can receive incoming email perfectly, I can't send any messages. These just go to the Evolution Outbox and stay there.\nI am using several E-Mail addresses: Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo and Sky. Gmail and Sky now work, (i.e., E-Mail can be received AND sent) but hotmail (my primary E-Mail address) and Yahoo will only receive.\nWhat could I have misconfigured when setting the system up?\n\nA: This may be the configuration of the SMTP server. Some SMTP servers will require an authentication, which usually is your username/password used for POP. Also, the SMTP server to use is the one from your internet provider, not necessarily the one from your email provider (if you use Outlook or GMail, for example). Check with your ISP. \nThere also may be some configuration issue for the port and the SSL/TLS option. \n\nA: at send email server for hotmail put smtp.live.com:587 an you wil be able to send email\n\nA: It's a bug as on launchpad.

Thnx for the tip it solved the problem immidiatly should work for hotmail and other mails too they don't use standard ports.\n\nA: I agree with Allan that need additional information before one can be certain of helping here. \nGood info to include would be:\nMail server: your own host, or ISP\nISP:  (internet service provider, like Comcast, Verizon, Optonline)\nSMTP: Configured Port (25, 465, 587), secure settings\nExample: If you are attempting to connect to a mail server outside your ISP on port 25, you will likely fail - ISP's routinely block outbound SMTP ports as a countermeasure against spam.\nIf you are wanting to connect to Hotmail, here is the Canonical link to the relevant settings.  \nThe important bit is setting the SMTP server to smtp.live.com:587 (note the :587 - that sets the port and is important), and that the authentication is set to TLS .\n", "Q: How can I make Gwibber use Desktop Couch?

This is because the system will dynamically lower this tasks priority.\nThe niceness influences the base priority.\nSo while niceness can be thought of as negative priority, it will have less effect than priority would have on a Microsoft NT system, as the Linux scheduler is already doing a good job at keeping things nice.\n\nA: 'nice' refers to the priority the process gets on your CPU. This is a number in the range of -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest). You'll probably find that most applications you're running are at nice '0', which means that they are running with normal priority and none will get preferential treatment by the scheduler over another.\nIf you're running an intensive program, you may wish to launch it from a terminal with nice -n 10 /path/to/program. That way it will impact less on the performance of your system.\nNote that you need root (sudo) privileges to schedule a process with priority greater than normal (<0). This is to prevent users from being able to bog down the entire system easily, and so that critical tasks can always receive the CPU time they require.\nThere's a good explanation on Wikipedia too.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to remote server via SSH (requires public key) So i've been given access to ssh a server.

How can I force the name of cd-drive? I am trying to install one game with WINE, which has three discs. It works until installation wants disk 2. Then it can't continue, because disk 2 appears as drive \"game_2\".\n\nA: Use /media/cdrom which should be symlinked to the right device.\n\nA: There are a couple things about your question that are unclear to me. First, AFAIK, the drive name should not change in linux or in wine. In linux it can be /dev/sr0, /dev/cdrom, etc... In Wine, it is a letter which you \"bind\" to a /dev/ in linux using wineconfig. The game is likely referring to the title of the optical media and it is apparently looking for a different disk to continue the install.

It's faster and it's easier to deal with. \n\nA: I had the same problem, and also another one that you seem to also have at the same time: a big annoying AMD Unsupported Harware icon. As a consequence, when I tried to install Ubuntu 10.10, it froze just after the login screen and when I tried to install Ubuntu 11.10, it did not even arrive to the login screen.\nHere is what I did, which solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*using another computer, download the latest proprietary driver from ATI on the official site. In my case I had to download it from here.\n\n*put the driver on a USB key\n\n*reboot the computer we want to repair\n\n*in the grub menu, select the recovery mode. This results in arriving at a command line interface. This is a proof that the Ubuntu operating system is functioning but that the problem is indeed the graphical card.\n\n*uninstall all previous versions of flgrx by launching sudo apt-get remove flgrx for example\n\n*mount the USB key with something close to mkdir /mnt/usb followed by sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/usb. Another way for this little step is explained here.\n\n*use the cd command to place yourself in the folder where the downloaded driver is\n\n*if necessary, make the driver be executable with something like chmod +x ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run\n\n*execute the driver using sudo ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run\n\n*follow the instructions given on the installer\n\n*if this step did not work, you may want to try sudo ./ati-driver-installer-11-11-x86.x86_64.run --force instead\n\n*reboot your computer\n\n\nThen your two problems should both be solved!\n\nA: Just managed to get the above card to work on my device, running 12.04, 64-bit. I started by following the suggestions here, none of which appeared to work in my case.\nThe device already had a video card (Matrox VGA) which was working fine. Wanted to add this to support dual monitors. When I added the AMD Radeon HD 6450 then I would get a blank screen. (Output from the Radeon was colored pixels with no sign of response from keyboard). I would bypass the blank screen with Ctrl-Alt-F2 to get a terminal up, which displayed as expected. \nOutput from fglrxinfo was command not found. \nThe link referred to by vikram appears no longer to be working and has moved to that referred to by Agmenor. I followed those instructions and it told me install had completed, so rebooted and same situation as above. \nUltimately I followed the instructions here on the Official Documentation which I will repeat briefly. These were run line-by-line as sudo:\n### backup configuration file\ncp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.BAK\n### in case already installed\napt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates\napt-get install -y fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\naticonfig --initial\nreboot\n### now check it's working\n### connect video out to new video card\nfglrxinfo\n### add video acceleration\napt-get install -y xvba-va-driver libva-glx1 libva-egl1 vainfo\n\nThis is good enough for me. The boot output still goes to the Matrox and the Radeon output is blank until X starts.\n", "Q: Will 11.04 come along with up to date GNOME Shell packages? Will Ubuntu 11.04 come along with up to date Gnome-Shell packages? \n\nA: Unfortunately it seems highly likely that GNOME Shell will not make it into the 11.04 repositories. This is because of its dependencies on the GNOME 3 stack, which won't make it into 11.04.\n\nThere have been quite a lot of architectural changes in the rest of the GNOME stack, which we aren't adopting in Ubuntu this cycle and are necessary to make gnome-shell work properly\n\nThere is likely to be a PPA with these underlying GNOME 3 libraries and a \"stable\" version of GNOME Shell. GNOME 3 is due for release on April 4th, so around this time I'd start to keep a look out for this PPA.\nFor more details see the mailing list post Status update on GNOME3 and natty\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade from Lucid Lynx to Maverick Meerkat I have got a problem with Update Manager.

I received a huge .tar.gz file from a client that contains about 800 mb of image files (when uncompressed.) Our hosting company's ftp is seriously slow, so extracting all the files locally and sending them up via ftp isn't practical. I was able to ftp the .tar.gz file to our hosting site, but when I ssh into my directory and try using unzip, it gives me this error:\n[esthers@clients locations]$ unzip community_images.tar.gz\nArchive:  community_images.tar.gz\n  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on the last disk(s) of this archive.\nnote:  community_images.tar.gz may be a plain executable, not an archive\nunzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of community_images.tar.gz or community_images.tar.gz.zip, and cannot find community_images.tar.gz.ZIP, period.\n\nWhat command do I need to use to extract all the files in a .tar.gz file?\n\nA: In case you are not able to extract .tar.gz file using \ntar -xvzf fileName.tar.gz\n\nTry extracting using\ntar xf fileName.tar.gz\n\n\nA: Remembering all flags for tar can be tedious. Obligatory XKCD:\n\nTherefore I made my own little script in Python to do that. Quick, dirty, cp-like in usage:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport tarfile,sys,os\ntf = tarfile.open(name=sys.argv[1],mode='r:gz')\nwhere = '.'\nif len(sys.argv) == 3:\n    where = sys.argv[2]\ntf.extractall(path=where)\ntf.close()\n\nUse it as so:\nmyuntar.py archive.tar\n\nSee also similar script for unzipping zip archives.\n\nA: If you want the files to be extracted to a particular destination you can add -C /destination/path/\nMake sure you make the directory first, in this case: ~/Pictures/Community\nExample:  \nmkdir ~/Pictures/Community\ntar xf community_images.tar.gz -C /home/emmys/Pictures/Community/\n\nYou can easily memorize it if you consider telling tar to e X tract a F ile\n\nNote: Remember you can search inside man pages with ?+term to look for, and then n and N to go to the next or previous instance of the term you are looking for.\n\nA: You could do this too in first step:\n\ngunzip community_images.tar.gz\n\nThen you have the file: community_images.tar\nSecond step would be:\n\ntar -xvf community_images.tar\n\nAnd the *.tar file would be extracted.\n\nA: tar xvf file.tar.gz\n\n\n*\n\n*x for extract\n\n*v for verbose (list files)\n\n*f for filename is next\n\n\nAny remotely modern version of tar should auto-detect that the archive is gzipped, and add \"z\" for you.\n\nA: Type man tar for more information, but this command should do the trick:\ntar -xvzf community_images.tar.gz\n\nTo explain a little further, tar collected all the files into one package, community_images.tar. The gzip program applied compression, hence the gz extension. So the command does a couple things:\n\n*\n\n*f: this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.\n\n*z: tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip\n\n*x: tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter.\n\n*v: makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the files being extracted.\n\nTo extract into a custom folder, add the -C option with a folder name of your choice:\ntar -xvzf community_images.tar.gz -C some_custom_folder_name\n\n\nA: At some point tar was upgraded to auto-decompress. All you need now is:\ntar xf community_images.tar.gz\n\nThe same explanation applies:\n\n\n*\n\n*f: this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.\n\n*x: extract the files.\n\n\nNote the lack of hyphen for the command flags. This is because most versions of tar allow both gnu and bsd style options (simplistically, gnu requires a hyphen, bsd doesn't).\n\nA: Quick Answer:\ntar -xvf  <.tar file> or <.tar.xz file>\ntar -xzvf <.tar.gz file>\ntar -xjvf <.tar.bz2 file>\n\n\n[NOTE]:\n\n*\n\n*-v Verbosely list files processed.\n\n*-z Filter the archive through gzip.\n\n*-f Use archive file or device ARCHIVE.\n\n*-x Extract files from an archive.\n\n*-j bzip2.\n\n*tar -xf archive.tar # Extract all files from archive.tar.\n\n", "Q: How to find out the installation path to my browser? I am installing a proprietary CAD application (MEDUSA4 personal) and the installer wants to know the path to my web browser (as a prerequisite for online help). I have the default firefox installation and chromium, but I don't know the installation path for any of them, and couldn't find them among the usual suspects (/usr/bin, /usr/lib). \nIt would be nice if you could tell me the path to one of them, and even nicer if you can tell me how to find out the installation path to any package managed by apt. \n\nA: Firefox is under /usr/bin/firefox but it's a symbolic link to /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.13/firefox.sh (please note that the version number may differ). I haven't installed gnome-chrome but it should be in /usr/bin like any other application.\nSynaptic has an option to show installed files. Right-click in the package's name and select options and locate \"Installed files\" tab. Search for a line starting with /usr/bin or similar to see where the binary file (which is run when you open an application) is installed, as you can see some addtional files like icons and help files aren't installed to /usr/bin but probably under /usr/share.\n\nA: In a console, do which firefox. This is my output, for instance:\nuser@PORTATIL:~$ which firefox\n/usr/bin/firefox\nuser@PORTATIL:~$ which google-chrome \n/usr/bin/google-chrome\n\n\nA: *\n\n*On the extremely-rare occasion that you get a choice, just install to the default. If there's no default, then /usr/bin should be alright.\n\n*Programs specify themselves where they install their bits to. Each part of the package needs to go into a different place so it can be found. You don't really need to know anything about this, but if you do, you can find where each part of the package has installed to by going to Synaptic, right-clicking on the package, going to Properties and then the Installed Files tab. \n", "Q: Is it possible to install Desktop edition in Server edition, then access remotely? Is it possible to install Desktop edition in Server edition, then access remotely? I can think of lots of applications for this, but don't know if it's possible, or what the drawbacks could be.\n\nA: you should install ubuntu-desktop and openssl-server\n\napt-get install ubuntu-desktop openssh-server\n\nthen use ssh -X to access your server remotely.\nor you can follow this to config your ssl\n\nA: As Petrie Wong noted you can install ubuntu-desktop on the server.  (This package is the desktop portion of the desktop edition.)  If you shutdown the desktop, you also shutdown the server. \nYou could also run the desktop edition in a virtual machine using KVM.  This would give some security separation between the server and desktop.  Shutting down the desktop would only kill the virtual machine and not the server. \nNormal access of servers is over SSH using the openssh-server package.   Programs requiring a graphical interface can be accesses using display forwarding over ssh, and only require a minimal set of x-window programs. \nOn a server providing a remote desktop, it is common to use a light-weight window manager.  A workable desktop with VNC access can be created by installing the packages: xinetd, tightvncserver, xdm, and xfce4-server.  Windows remote desktop access can be provided by adding the xrdp package.  I documented my setup for Remote Desktops with VNC and RDP.\n\nA: If you mean install the set of applications ( mostly gui ) that are installed by default in Desktop Edition, but not Server Edition, then just install the ubuntu-desktop package.\n\nA: if you wan to install a graphical desktop manager without some of the desktop addons like Evolution and OpenOffice, but continue to use the server flavor kernel use the following command\nsudo aptitude install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Why does ubuntu have a separate package for unison version 2.27.57? The current ubuntu repo contains an extra set of packages for version 2.27.57 of the unison file sychronization utility:\n$ aptitude search unison\np   unison                          - A file-synchronization tool for Unix and W\np   unison-gtk                      - A file-synchronization tool for Unix and W\np   unison2.27.57                   - A file-synchronization tool for Unix and W\np   unison2.27.57-gtk               - A file-synchronization tool for Unix and W\n\n$ aptitude show '~nunison[^-]*$' | grep 'Package\\|Version'\nPackage: unison\nVersion: 2.32.52-1ubuntu2\nPackage: unison2.27.57\nVersion: 2.27.57-2\n\nWhat is the reason for this?  Are there backwards incompatibilities in more recent versions of unison?\n\nA: Unison  insists on having exactly the same version at both ends of the connection. Each version depends on a particular version of the system C libraries. So if ONE of the machines on which you work happens to have an old version of these libraries, you have to use the corresponding old version of Unison on ALL of the machines that you use.\n\nA: We inherit the unison package from Debian. From looking at the changelog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fork a unison2.27.57 package to maintain compatibility with lenny/squeeze,\nthe rest of the changelog can be found in unison package.\n\n\nFrom searching I found the maintainer's blog where he mentions:\n\nSome careful readers of Planet OCamlCore should wonder why the OCaml packages in Debian has not yet been upgraded to 3.12.0. For the Planet Debian readers, this is the latest version of the Objective Caml programming language.\nThe answer is simple: Debian Squeeze froze on 6th August. This means that Debian folks focus on fixing release critical bugs and avoid doing big transitions in unstable (Sid). In particular, the Debian OCaml maintainers has decided to keep OCaml 3.11.2 for Squeeze, because the delay was really too short: OCaml 3.12 was out on 2nd August.\n\nSo it's likely that this fork was needed in order to keep Unison running on the OCaml that was being shipped in Debian at the time. Now that Debian Squeeze has released this will likely work itself out at some point in the future and we'll end up with just \"unison\" in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Decrease filesize when resizing with mogrify I love the command line options of imagemagick. Mogrify is great to resize images and change quality, which is what I use most often. However, I have noted that the filesize if often larger than what it should be. Especially with small images. For instance, I have a regular 640px (width) photo, which I change to quality 80 and a width of 80px:\nmogrify -quality 80 -resize 80 file.jpg\n\nWorks well and my image gets resized and the quality is changed to 80. However, the filesize is around 40Kb. For such a tiny image, that is huge! When I use mtPaint, and open the file and save it (not changing anything, just CTRL+O, CTRL+S), the filesize decreases with more than 95% to less than 2Kb! I have seen this is often the case. \nWhat goes wrong?\n\nA: I found the answer... it was in the \"metadata\"! Apparently this easily weighs about 18 Kb per image, so in the original you might not note this, but in the tiny resize it means 18 Kb + 2 Kb = 20 Kb total filesize. They significantly increased by doing: \nmogrify -strip file.jpg\n\nA: TL;DR: specify -compress + compression format, in addition to -strip, to keep the same compression format of the input file(s) and reduce file size.\nProblem\nAs user6019 has mentioned, -strip will remove the metadata of whatever file you pass through mogrify or magick mogrify (>= ver. 7).\nHowever, when I tried this command, which is a version of the above:\nmagick mogrify -strip -density 535 -debug cache *.tif,\nthe sizes of my output files still didn't decrease.\nVersion information\nOS: Windows 11 Home, Version 21H2\nIM: 7.1.0-19 Q16-HDRI x64 2021-12-22\nSolution\nAfter inspecting the details of the files before and after mogrify, I noticed that mogrify removed the compression format of my input files, leaving totally uncompressed files. As a result, all file sizes were blown up by about 400x (input = 59 KB; output = 26,172 KB).\nAfter reading this post, it seems that ImageMagick treats LZW-compressed files differently depending on if the compression format is \"enabled\". I explicitly forced the compression format using this line of code (after compiling the above command):\nmagick mogrify -compress LZW *.tif\nand file sizes returned to the same magnitude as they were before processing with IM (i.e. file sizes decreased).\nSo, in the future, if people are concerned about output file sizes following mogrify or even convert/magick calls, double-check compression too!\n", "Q: Plymouth splash screen different boot than shutdown \nPossible Duplicate:\n1920 x 1080 Splash \n\nThe Plymouth boot splash screen is off center, although the shut-down one works as i set it (not original).\nwhy are my boot Plymouth and shut-down Plymouths different\n\nA: You have to Press Alt + f2 and paste\ngksu update-initramfs -c -k all\n\n", "Q: In 'apt-cache depends' output, what is the meaning of Suggests, Recommends, |, <>?

In other words, Python interpreter is embedded within the mod_wsgi.\n\nSo I would not recommend any of precompiled mod_wsgi binaries from apt but instead you can compile it following the official installation docs.\nThe other way\nUse https://gunicorn.org/ and an Apache's\nProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/\n\ndirective in your virtualhost config.\n", "Q: Will applications be putting user data in ~/.config instead of just ~? Are there any plans to have applications store data from each user in home/user/.config instead of just home/user/ and their respective directories? \n\nA: As mentioned in my answer to a releated question, ~/.config is part of the FreeDesktop Base Directory Specification.\nAccording to the spec, \"user data\" should not actually be put in ~/.config at all.\n\n\n*\n\n*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is where user\nspecific configuration files should\nbe stored.\n\n*$XDG_DATA_HOME is where user\nspecific data files should be stored.\n\n*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to\n~/.config\n\n*$XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to\n~/.local/share\nAs I say in a comment in that question: compliance is voluntary, but there has been discussion in the past about making XDG compliance a \"goal\" for all application in the default install.\n", "Q: Can I choose to automatically download all updates and install the important ones? Why can't I select both of these?\n\n\nA: I don't know exactly why the interface is limited and possibly counterintuitive like this.  I'm ready to chalk it up to reducing complexity and adding sane defaults. \nFor a desktop user, that often makes sense.   However, if you are using a server, you wouldn't be using this method, and so I'll add some info on alternatives that provide more flexibility, at the expense of complexity.  They also provide you (given a little time to familiarize yourself with them) a clearer view of exactly what actions will take place. \nOn the server side, the standard way to configure this is probably to use unattended-upgrades.  This might be the best way to do this on the desktop as well.  \nHere's a decent guide on this (and some other Ubuntu methods):\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates\nNote that this guide does not discourage using the Gnome Update Manager, which is GUI you are referring to.  This is a user-editable wiki page, so I'm chalking this up to conflating server and desktop tools.  (Though it is of course possible to install, e.g., Gnome on a server, too.)\nAnother method mentioned is cron.  Cron has the advantage of being pretty transparent in what it does, and giving you great control, as it is typically hand-configured.   This unfortunately also has the consequence of maintainability being limited to whatever system you create yourself. \nAn older but still available method is to use cron-apt.  I've used this on Debian boxes, and it works on Ubuntu as well.   I think the documentation is horrible, however. \ncron-apt can optionally email status and updates. Here's an example: \nCRON-APT RUN [/etc/cron-apt/config]: Wed Feb  9 04:00:01 CST 2011\nCRON-APT SLEEP: 1315, Wed Feb  9 04:21:56 CST 2011\nCRON-APT ACTION: 3-download\nCRON-APT LINE: /usr/bin/apt-get dist-upgrade -d -y -o APT::Get::Show-Upgraded=true\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n  libfreetype6\n1 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 0B/385kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 0B of additional disk space will be used.\nDownload complete and in download only mode\n\nA short but helpful page on cron-apt can be found on the TurnKey Linux Automatic Security Updates page.   The descriptions work here because TurnKLey Linux is based on Ubuntu.   Their cron-apt usage updates more aggressively, about which they have this to say: \n\nIn practice we've found it is very\n  rare for an Ubuntu security update to\n  break something, so we believe it is\n  beneficial to  configure software\n  appliances to auto-update security\n  fixes by default. Advanced users can\n  always disable this mechanism and\n  apply security fixes manually if they\n  want.\n\n", "Q: Setting up a shared media drive I want to have a shared media drive be transparently usable to all users, whilst also sticking to FHS and Ubuntu standards. The former takes priority if necessary. I currently mount it at /media/Stuff but /media is supposed to be for external media, i believe. The main issue is setting right permissions so that access to read and write to the drive can be granted to multiple users working within the same directories.\nInstallingANewHardDrive seems both slightly confused and not what I want. It claims that this sets ownership for the top-level directory (despite the recursion flag):\n    sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME /media/mynewdrive\n\nAnd that this will let multiple users create files and sub-directories but only delete their own:\n    sudo chgrp plugdev /media/mynewdrive\n    sudo chmod g+w /media/mynewdrive\n    sudo chmod +t /media/mynewdrive\n\nHowever, the group writeable bit does not seem to get inherited, which is troublesome for keeping things organised (prevents creation inside sub-folders originally made by another user). The sticky bit is probably also unwanted for the same reason, although currently it seems that one userA (perhaps the owner of the mount-point?) can delete the userB's files, but not vice-versa. This is fine, as long as userB can create files inside the directory of userA. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the correct mount point?\n\n*Is plugdev the correct group?\n\n*Most importantly, how to set up permissions to maintain an organised media drive?\n\n\nI do not want to be running cron jobs to set permissions regularly!\n\nA: The correct mount point is /mnt/mynewdrive; plugdev is not correct; on permissions, why not use access control lists (ACL)?\nAre the ACL tools installed by default? Can't remember, but, cannot hurt to...\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nMount the file systems with the acl option in /etc/fstab.\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx / ext4 defaults,acl 0 1\nsudo mount -o remount,acl /\n\nThen make a group to which a user may belong for this purpose, which I'll call stone, and then make a user a member of that group.\nsudo groupadd stone\nsudo usermod -a -G stone $username\n\nThe user needs to log out and in again to become a member of the group.\nIf the directory, /mnt/mynewdrive, is mounted and completely empty:\nsudo chown root.stone /mnt/mynewdrive\nsudo chmod 0775 /mnt/mynewdrive\nsudo chmod g+s  /mnt/mynewdrive\nsudo chmod +t   /mnt/mynewdrive\nsudo setfacl -d -m u::rwx,g::rwx,o::r-x /mnt/mynewdrive\n\nAbove...\n\n\n*\n\n*Change owner to root and group owner to stone\n\n*Give write ability to the stone group\n\n*Cause all new files to be group-owned by stone\n\n*Restrict delete and rename to all but the user who created the file\n\n*By default, allow user and group rwx, others: rx.\n\n\nA: For now, I would suggest setting up a drive without permissions. Use FAT32 or some other non-secure file system and share it over samba.\nIn the future, I think we need to seriously look at how we enable these kinds of features in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: VirtualBox: Why are some USB devices disabled? Overview:\nMy Host OS is Ubuntu 10.10 and guest OS is WinXP on the VirtualBox version downloaded from Oracle including \"VirtualBox 4.0 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack\" so that USB passthrough works. This works in general (I was able to back up my iPhone to iTunes in the guest OS), but some devices aren't available even though they're ptrovided in the VirtualBox settings.\nSpecifics: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the VirtualBox settings for the guest OS, there's the part where you can select which of your USB devices should be visible to the guest OS. I've selected several devices including the iPhone. So far so good.  \n\n*Then an iOS upgrade came along; my iPhone is now in DFU mode (or recovery mode?) and represents itself not as \"iPhone\" but as \"iPhone (DFU mode)\".  \n\n*I have now also added this device to the list of USB devices that the guest OS should see -- but it doesn't see this device. The DFU device is listed in the menu of USB devices available to the guest OS, but it's disabled (greyed out)! So I can't select it, so the guest OS doesn't see it.\nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Am I right in expecting that the guest OS ought to see the DFU device when I add it in the VirtualBox settings? \n\n*What steps do I need to take so that the guest OS will really see the DFU device? Why is the DFU device greyed out, and how do I make it selectable?\n\nA: Disclaimer: I don't own an iphone, and have no way to test any part of this answer. So it is all theoretical knowledge, quite possible wrong.\nDFU is a standard way of updating device firmware. The device will appear as a DFU device to the host, the host will upload a firmware update to it, it will apply the update and appear as a new device to the host. So what it's likely happening is that VirtualBox is not seeing the new device, not the DFU one.\nThis are the steps that I would take to resolve/debug the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to VirtuabBox configuration, in the USB section delete everything. This will allow VirtuaBox to catch all the USB devices. See the screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Start VirtualBox, connect the device. It should appear on the Devices->USB Devices Menu as a DFU device. Click on it. Now the guest OS will install it's drivers and upload the firmware to it. Wait patiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go again to the Devices->USB Devices menu. It should be there as a different device. Click on it. Enjoy.\n\n\nSorry for the screenshots language, if you don' understand then just ask. The devices are disabled on the second screenshot because VirtualBox is running under an user not member of the virtualbox group.\n", "Q: Are there tools to manage the power management for HDD? I wonder if there are a better tool than the panel at System → Preferences → Power Management  to manage the power consumption for the HDD. Specifically HDD in a laptop.\n\nA: You can experiment a bit with a few options for hdparm command. Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*-S <number> sets the idle timeout before the drive turns its spindle\noff.\n\n*-M <number> sets the Acoustic Management Mode (this parameter also\nhelps in the power management)\n\n\nI don't report here how the value should be chosen, I let you to read it from the man page.\nThat said, I would NOT recommend to choose timeout values too short, as still one of the most stressing times for a hard disk is the spin-up time, i.e. it's better to leave a HDD spin a little longer while idling than continuously turn it off and on, especially with modern, low-power HDDs.\n", "Q: Modernising settings, packages The update manager (possibly combined with the janitor) does a reasonable job of bringing packages up to date with a new release, removing ones that are replaced by different projects etc. However, I'm left with the lingering feeling that quite a few settings are lingering from old releases.\nFor example, some packages may be left around that I installed myself whereas now the functionality is provided by default. Another example is that my user doesn't get the new theme, and the panel bar is a mess. I can compare against an inactive user on the same system: everything seems tidier. There are also things like the explosion of System Preferences, user groups (inactive user, more recently created, is in groups that the older, active user isn't). In other areas (e.g. default font) I do seem to get given the new defaults.\nAnother example is Spotlight-equivalent search. I remember Beagle and Tracker, I remember removing tracker when it used all system RAM and swap for 2 entire release cycles, but I don't know what I'm \"supposed\" to be using now. Is there even a default indexing-search installed and exposed? aptitude install ubuntu-desktop doesn't do anything, so the basics are in place package-wise.\nIs there any way to update my settings to the modern \"Ubuntu way\" without reinstalling from scratch? Can I do so selectively i.e. show the differences?\nMost of the time package management on Linux is an absolute joy compared to the alternatives, but if the desktop gets messed up after only a release or two, we're back to reinstalling just like Windows.\n\nA: You can reset any settings by removing the corresponding folder in your home directory. For instance if you want to reset gnome panel and options:\nrm -fr ~/.gnome2 ~/.gconf\n\nIf you want to remove options for a program, they'll either have a similar hidden file or a file in ~/.config which you can remove. Removing configs basically resets them to default.\nYou could also create a new user, which would allow you to compare the settings.\n", "Q: How to Save Filters with PNG in Inkscape I have created a graphic with multiple layers in Inkscape. One of the layers is some text. I have applied a drop shadow filter to the text. When I save the file as PNG, the drop shadow is not saved. I have also tried applying a gaussian blur to the text layer and to the text layer after converting it to an object. The blur is not applied.\nHow can I save the file as PNG with the drop shadow intact?\n\nA: You are probably not exporting the whole image. I think by default Inkscape exports only what you have currently selected. So when you export, make sure you have everything you want selected, or choose \"Page\" in the export type.\n\nA: works here with Inkscape 0.47 r22583 (Apr  4 2010)\nregardless of whether I use \"page\" or \"selection\" when exporting to bitmap. Which version do you use ?\n(checked with display command of the Image Magick package, if that matters)\n", "Q: Make global application menu replace titlebar in gnome-panel I am trying out Ubuntu 11.04, and one of my favourite features is the global application menu.

Is it possible to have this functionality with gnome-panel?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: i think you want this\nhttp://pkgs.org/ubuntu-10.10/webupd8-i386/gnome-window-applets_0.2.10-1~webupd8~maverick_i386.deb.html\n\nif you experience applets moving unintentionally you should consider the complete lock down all panels option in \nubuntu tweak -> GNOME Settings -> complete lockdown of all panels\n\nif you dont have ubuntu tweak you can get it at the software center...\n\nA: if you have compiz, you'll must go to \"windows decoration\" and wheres apear \"any\" add \"& !state=maxhorz\" or something like that. sorry the impressitions, but i'm not on my pc\n\nA: A very simple bash script to toggle the panel lock_down is:\n#!/bin/bash\ngconftool-2 --toggle /apps/panel/global/locked_down\n\n\nA: Yes go to add to panel you will find four different indicators there choose the ones you want and just remove from panel anything you don't.\nNote some widgets have to be unlocked first before you can remove them.\n", "Q: How to remove GRUB selection?

I have downloaded the Ubuntu 10.10 ISO file and am trying to burn it to a blank disc so that I can install it, using Ubuntu 8.04. I have a dual boot system with Windows and Ubuntu. \nHere's my experience so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up my current install of Hardy Heron\n\n*Go to install updates.

Asks me to reenter disk for checksum. Checksum check freezes after 10 minutes. I attempt to eject disk and it tells me 100% success.\n\n*After restarting from newly burned CD it shows me a screen with Ubuntu and 5 dots, it stays like that for 10 minutes and then eventually I get an error cannot mount disk.\n\n\nA: To put the application on the Menu list: right click on Application->edit menu-> sound & video check the application you want to display in the application  drop down menu.\nburning software i recommend \"K3b\"  you can put k3b in the application menu like the first one. or the other option is run the application using terminal open terminal write K3b.\n\nA: Edit - Re brasero failed:\nI don't know why it is not working, but the version of Ubuntu you are currently using is very old and no longer supported so don't take this experience as representative of the present.\nYou state that you have Windows installed, so you could try to burn the image using your Windows installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Infra Recorder, a free and open-source image-burning program.\n\n*Insert a blank CD in the drive and select Do nothing or Cancel if an autorun dialog box pops up.\n\n*Open Infra Recorder and click the 'Write Image' button in the main screen.\n\n*Alternatively you can select the 'Actions' menu, then 'Burn image'.\n\n*Select the Ubuntu CD image file you want to use, then click 'Open'.\n\n*In the dialog box, click 'OK'.\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to just right click on the disk image and click 'Write to Disc...'. I don't know if that option was available in 8.04.\nIf not, use Brasero. Make sure the brasero package is installed (you can install it using Synaptic). \nOpen Brasero from the Applications->Sound and Video menu and choose 'Burn image'.\n\nYou should then be able to select the image file and chose a disc to burn it to:\n\nFor more instructions check out step 2 of this page and click the 'Show me how' button, selecting which platform you want to use to burn the disc.\n\nA: The best way I have found to burn a downloaded, Ubuntu operating system iso file to a blank CD is not to use Brasero, it never seems to work and always tells me that my blank disc has insufficient space. \nI use GnomeBaker CD Writer/Burner, which can be installed from Ubuntu Download Centre.\nAfter opening GnomeBaker be careful NOT to select one of the three tabs in the 'Make new project' section - otherwise you will just copy the iso file. You need to go to 'Tools' in the top menu bar and select 'Burn CD Image' - that way you will get all the other files that you need to install your new version of Ubuntu.\nGood Luck\n\nA: The standard program for burning iso's in ubuntu is Brasero found in the sound menu.

In Windows, you have these shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*WinArrow Up ↑: Maximize current window\n\n*WinArrow Down ↓: Unmaximize\n\n*WinArrow Right →: Maximize, set width as half the screen width, stick window to the right\n\n*WinArrow Left ←: Maximize, set width as half the screen width, stick window to the left\n\n\nI’m particularly interested in the last two shortcuts.\n\nA: I use the \"grid\" option of CompizConfig Settings Manager.  \"Grid\" is developed as an extra plugin, so you have to install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra  package (I couldn't see this in \"software center\", so did it through synaptic).\nOnce you have the plugins installed, in CCSM, go to \"Window Managment\", then select \"Grid\".  I modify my \"put left\" to be CTRL + SHIFT + left arrow (and do likewise for \"put right\", \"put top\", and \"put bottom\").  I map CTRL + SHIFT + enter to be \"put center\".\nI am not sure about W7, but the GREAT thing about GRID is that if you hit it once, it will go to half the screen.  A second time goes to 1/3 of the screen.  A third time has it take up 2/3 of the screen.  Then, a fourth has it back to half.  So, you can set up documents side by side that need 1/3 or 2/3 of the screen as well as equally sharing 1/2 of the screen.\nA MUST plugin for me in Linux!

I previously had Heron 8.04 installed. Today I decided to upgrade.\nDuring the partition phase of the install of 10.10 it asked me what portion of the drive I should use. There were a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the partition size to indicate what I wanted to use\n\n*A button that said use entire partition\n\n*A button that said use entire drive\n\n\nI selected use entire partition as the Windows partition did not appear on the screen I assumed this was just displaying the existing Ubuntu partition.\nAfter install I think I have wiped my entire Windows partition, I can't see it anywhere.\nI would appreciate some advice as to find if it really is gone forever (My stupidity I didn't back up my Windows partition which includes 3 years of baby photos).\n\nUPDATE: Thanks all for your great answers. I read on a forum last night about Active Partition Recovery. I didn't realise it was a commercial product, so the demo doesn't let you recover, but it did allow me to see that the whole partition still exists somewhere on the drive. It even let me see the individual files.\nAs suggested I have stopped doing anything with the drive until I can give Testdisk a try. If this works I will confirm it in a separate answer for future reference.\n\nA: You can see all of your partitions by running System->Administration->Disk Utility. Once the window opens, click on your hard drive on the right hand side. Have a look at the partitions.\nIf one of the partitions is an NTFS partition, it is likely that this is your Windows partition. If it is there, you can access the partition from the Places menu.\n\nA: Until you know what happened, stop using the computer.  Even if you did re-use the partition, there is a chance you did not overwrite all of the stuff on it and you may be able to recover.  But the chance of recovering goes down the longer you use the partition!\nAll the work you do to recover should be from a bootable CD or USB key so you don't risk overwriting something.\nPersonally, I like the System Rescue CD as it bundles a lot of good stuff in one place.\nGood Luck.\n\nA: I want to add this as a reference to others. Here is how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to avoid doing anything else with the disk. I installed TestDisk on my drive as part of the recovery effort, but I only had a single drive. A safer option would be to install Ubuntu to a thumb drive and then install the TestDisk package there.\n\n*Ran TestDisk and recovered the partitions and wrote back to disk. Note this still didn't fix my MBR with Gnome 2 installed.\n\n*Booted from 10.10 CD and was able to mount the 2 previous partitions. Copied contents including my precious photos onto a 16GB thumb drive.\n\n*Wiped drive and reinstalled Windows and Ubuntu (carefully reading instructions this time to correctly specify partition).\nLessons learned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always back up your data before doing anything!\n\n*Always read the instructions before doing anything! If I wasn't hasty I wouldn't have screwed up the partitioning. The second time I did it I read carefully and I easily saw where I went wrong.\n\n\nA: In case you can't see your NTFS Windows partition by using Disk Utility as recommended by dv3500ea, or by typing\n`fdisk -l`\n\nfrom the command line you may indeed have messed up your partition from the bug psusi mentioned.\nTo recover the remainders of your data I suggest you try to do this with PhotoRec, quite a powerful tool to recover data even from heavily corrupted partitions or drives.\n\nA: Funny, I was just reading this related askubuntu post: recovering files with Testdisk or Foremost.\n\nA: Yes, you have trashed your Windows install.  That screen normally shows what it is going to do with your Windows partition.  By default it splits it and shows Windows on one side, and Ubuntu on the other.  Choosing to use the entire partition does away with the split and has Ubuntu use the whole partition, replacing Windows.  This was a bad user interface choice in 10.10 and is a known bug.  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/655950.\n\nA: Probably you had installed ubuntu on your windows partition.If so maybe you can recover some of your files with TestDisk http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk\nPlease post output of this command:\ndf -h\n\nIt shows information about your partitions.\n\nA: If you can't find the disk you can use TestDisk to recover the parititon, otherwise you can recover the files from the partition using foremost.\nPlease enter in terminal:\ncat /proc/partitions\n\nCan you please put the results here?\n", "Q: Futon for Ubuntu One Is Futon on the Ubuntu One Server availible? Is it possible to see/modify the CouchDB Databases on the Ubuntu One server?\n\nA: It is possible to see and modify the Ubuntu One CouchDB, but not via Futon. All you need to do is do OAuth-authenticated (but not HMAC-signed OAuth) REST requests to the right URL, using your Ubuntu One-specific Ubuntu SSO token.\nOne easy(ish) way of seeing the Ubuntu One CouchDB is using a little tool I wrote, which I called watgui because I'm really bad at names.

I can remember I used this method to hunt down viruses and malware hiding locations when I used windows a few years back.\n\nA: As a complete over-kill option, but one that works in real-time, you can use inotify:\nsudo inotifywait -m -r /\n\nNote that this will consume a great deal of memory, and take a long time to set up. As the manpage says:\n   -r, --recursive\n          Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as arguments.\n          Watches  will be set up recursively to an unlimited depth.  Sym‐\n          bolic links are not  traversed.   Newly  created  subdirectories\n          will also be watched.\n\n          Warning:  If  you use this option while watching the root direc‐\n          tory of a large tree, it may take quite a while until  all  ino‐\n          tify watches are established, and events will not be received in\n          this time.  Also, since one inotify watch  will  be  established\n          per subdirectory, it is possible that the maximum amount of ino‐\n          tify watches per user will be reached.  The default  maximum  is\n          8192;  it  can  be  increased  by  writing  to /proc/sys/fs/ino‐\n          tify/max_user_watches.\n\nThis also doesn't tell you what process is messing with files, but it may help identify changes as they happen. Using \"-e open\" may help reduce some of the noise on a really busy system.\n\nA: That program is lsof (\"List open files\").\n\n*\n\n*If you just open a Terminal and type lsof, you get a huge list of all open files, instead, limit it to one command by doing:\n lsof -c gnome-terminal\n\n\n\n*You can also restrict your search to a specific directory by typing\n lsof -c gnome-terminal -a +D /tmp\n\n\n\n*Or list all open files in one specific directory, including what application has opened it:\n lsof /dev/urandom\n\nRemember that some processes are started by the superuser root, you may need to put sudo in front of your command to get more information about such processes' open files.\nTo narrow down your search, you can grep specific lines, i.e.:\nlsof /dev/urandom | grep chrome\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The FD (File Descriptor) column of the output gives you information about the purpose of the program opening the file (not necessarily what's happening to it at the moment):\n\n*\n\n*r means the file is opened for reading\n\n\n*w means the file is opened for writing\n\n\n*u means the file is opened for both reading and writing\n\nFor more details, consult the manual page (man lsof). Also, if you need to look up any of the files and directories, the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is very helpful.\n", "Q: Broadcom wireless card only works when the power is plugged in I've a Dell, with a Broadcom BCM4312 802.11b/g wireless card.

I can still get into Ubuntu with the command line, and it was installed beside Windows so I had access to my Windows partition as well. My question is - is it possible to access the Windows partition using the command line?\n\nA: First you need to know the partition your Windows is.

(Backup the files in /etc and your home directory at least).\nOn #3, yes it is possible. Yet, later you could find out how to install a missing application, though another repository, possibly.\n\nA: I think upgrading over the internet or using the alternate CD will be a better option for you if you really need to achieve the three goals, rather than going for a fresh installation.\n\nA: Question 1 - Part 1: Which software is installed on my current Ubuntu system?\nI solved this little problem for me with a little script that I called install.sh. Every time I've installed something new, I added the line sudo apt-get install [name-of-the-program] to this file.\nIf you realy want a complete list, dpkg --get-selections | awk '!/deinstall|purge|hold/ {print $1 \" \" $2}' > packages.list is what you are looking for.\nBut sometimes a program gets replaced in Ubuntu for some reason, e.g. LibreOffice replaces OpenOffice. You should at least try the new version, as it might fit better in the existing system. If you do this very often you can get a lot of programs that you don't realy need.\nIn both solutions you have to copy your package sources: cp /etc/apt/sources.list .\nQuestion 1 - Part 2: How do I reinstall the software on a fresh Ubuntu system?\nFirst, get your sources. Copy all entries, that were added by you manually to your new sources.list. Then execute sudo apt-get update\nIf you used my script-solution, just execute the script: ./install.sh\nIf you used the complete list, just type xargs -a \"packages.list\" sudo apt-get install\nQuestion 2: How can I get them configured the as they were before?\nSome programs, like the Browsers Chrome and Firefox, have an option to synchronise configurations. For every other program you will have to find the configuration file and save it manually.\nQuestion 3\nI don't know an example, but as far as I know this can happen. \nQuestion 4\nIf you have an second hard drive, you could do it like I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the whole system on another drive.\n\n*Install the newer system\n\n*Execute the install.sh you have created before with the software you really don't want to miss. Don't install more!\n\n*Give the new software a try. If it matches your needs, it's great! If not, just copy the configuration files of our second hard drive and install the old program.\n\n\nIf you don't want to have that much work, just upgrade your system.\n", "Q: What does \"pts/\" in the output of w mean?

It is used to\ncreate a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.\nWhen a process opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a\npseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device\nis created in the /dev/pts directory. Each file descriptor obtained by\nopening /dev/ptmx is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS,\nwhose path can be found by passing the descriptor to ptsname(3).\nBefore opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's\nfile descriptor to grantpt(3) and unlockpt(3).\nOnce both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave\nprovides processes with an interface that is identical to that of a\nreal terminal.\nData written to the slave is presented on the master descriptor as\ninput. Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.\nIn practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal\nemulators such as xterm(1), in which data read from the pseudoterminal\nmaster is interpreted by the application in the same way a real\nterminal would interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login\nprograms such as sshd(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal\nmaster is sent across the network to a client program that is\nconnected to a terminal or terminal emulator.\nPseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that\nnormally refuse to read input from pipes (such as su(1), and\npasswd(1)).\n\nSource: http://linux.die.net/man/4/pts\nThey're usually xterminal/gnome-terminal/terminator sessions.\n", "Q: Couldn't make Angry birds work on wine I can run Notepad++ the Angry bird exe is not working.

I know how to manually edit the menu, and I could go through it myself, but I'm looking for some script or package that will clean for me so I wouldn't have to do it manually every release cycle.\n\nA: Well, I found this script\nexport PACKAGES=$(dpkg -l | awk '{if ($1 == \"rc\") print $2\" \"}' | tr -d '\\n') [ -n \"$PACKAGES\" ] && sudo apt-get purge $PACKAGES\n\non ubuntuforums.org that shall purge the removed installations.

Nothing. Where can I go from there?\nEDIT: I logged out/in and restarted my computer. Both didn't change a thing. The problem seems to come from the fact that no matter what I do the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not properly passed to Ubuntu.\nUsing log files, I found that the application I'm trying to run in this example doesn't find one it's dependencies located in ~/usr/lib.\nOne solution would be to add the /home/jim/usr/lib folder inside a file located in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/, but I don't have admin rights on this machine.\nMaking a wrapper script like this one works:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HLOC/usr/lib\napplication &> $HOME/application_messages.log\n\nbut that would force me to wrap all my home compiled applications with this script.

Is it because trying to do this is bad practice?\nUPDATE (and solution): As found by Christopher, there is a bug report about this on launchpad. LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset after parsing of the ~/.profile file. See the bug report.

I would like to make Gedit fit more to the Ubuntu default themes Ambiance and Radiance. Therefore I would like to place the tab close buttons on the left instead of the right of each tab.\nI asked a similar question about Firefox, but the best answer was adding an extension. So what can I do for Gedit ?\nBesides, I bet I will shortly ask equivalent questions for Nautilus, etc.\n\nA: During the Ayatana discussion in this bug report, tab placement inconsistency in the design was mentioned 115 times, in over 20 separate posts, throughout the near-800 comments, but the final decision was still to move window buttons to the left.\nIf you desire consistency, you're far better moving the window buttons back to the right using one of the many methods described in that bug report.  For example, use gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string \":minimize,maximize,close\" or add the PPA outlined in comment 792.\nHowever, you've already fixed Firefox with a plug-in, and hopefully someone can help you hack Gedit.  That leaves the list of \"to-do\", for me personally, at :\nNautilus, Pidgin/Empathy, Thunderbird, Chromium and Eclipse\nBottom line, re-designing all these apps will take time.

What is the difference between executing a script (e.g. /some/script) with source /some/script and . /some/script in Bash?\n\nA: . is synonymous with source in bash, but not in POSIX sh, so you should use . if your script is run by /bin/sh.  Note that bash claims to run like POSIX sh when called as /bin/sh, but accepts source without complaint.  \nThis behaviour has bitten me, scripts tested with bash as /bin/sh fail when run under ash, for example.\n\nA: source and . are synonymous in Bash.\nFor anyone who might like to verify that the commands are simply synonyms and nothing more, look at the source code, say for version 4.3, and examine the file builtins/source.def. You will read that both of the built-in commands, source and ., use the very same function: source_builtin. \n", "Q: Wallpaper change crontab jobs not working after upgrade from 8.04 to 10.04 I have a crontab job set.

You can even use a CD instead of downloading packages for the upgrade.\nWhat I believe you want to do is record the installed applications and reinstall from scratch.

If yes, does the CD got right after the release become less useful?\nI plan 50 GB for Ubuntu partitions, 20 GB for root and 26 GB for home and 4 GB for swap. \nMy main use is programming with several popular programming languages and database and typesetting and browsing internet, seldom gaming, and therefore I will install related applications and compile some libraries for use in programming.\n\nA: Use the latest stable release\nAs it is predominantly a development machine, I would go with the latest stable version, as it has more up to date libraries and programming tools. As a normal release, it is not supported for as long as the LTS. I don't see this as a problem because you will probably want to have the newer versions installed by the time the support expires.\nLTS versions are more suitable for business users and home users who don't want to worry about upgrading every 6 months.\n\nA: The 10.04 is the long-term support (LTS) distribution; but, 10.10 is the latest - with better driver support and newer kernel.\n", "Q: How to append multiple lines of text to a file?

You can do anything with it (resizing, compressing,...)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://handbrake.fr/\nor \n\n\n*\n\n*launchpad.net > handbrake\n\nA: WOW!\nH264 is a high quality video codec but (as you refer), it makes \"heavy\" size video files.\nI am not sure if your question is related to a GUI or Command Line task. But, assumming that you are using \"Transmaggedon\" I will write this considering the options for GUI applications.\nIn my case, I prefer the usage of \"Mobile Media Converter\" which works pretty fine in 32bit systems (both Ubuntu and MS based systems). And the creators have already released a 64 bit version nowadays.\nWhat you wish is to make smaller size video files. Which can be done by changing the \"video bit rate\", which will give you the best quality, according to the video bit rate you request. In example: a 40MB video file (uncompressed, AVI) will fit in a 5MB video file (any codec) if you use a 800kbps video bit rate. But -of course- it may harm the quality.\nI strongly suggest you to perform some testing using the Mobile Media Converter, which can be reached (.deb) by clicking the next link: \nhttp://www.miksoft.net/mobileMediaConverter.htm\nAfter installing, just drop any video files (preferably small for the test) into the drag and drop area, then open the Advanced options by clicking a small arrow that is placed at the very right of the window, below the \"browse\" button. \"[ ... ]\"\nNext, click in \"Advanced\" and you will have all the options that you need in order to transcode your video and make small and good quality transcodification.\nRemember: The higher video bit rate is, you will have better quality but the file size will become \"heavier\".\nBTW: You can also transcode videos by using a non linear editing system, such as \"Kdenlive\" (http://www.kdenlive.org/) or \"Openshot\" (http://www.openshotvideo.com/) and many more. A non linear editing system will also be useful to edit the video (trim, crop, add text and more).\nGood luck!\nHere is a screenshot for you to see a few options of Mobile Media Converter in action.\n\n\nA: From a video encoding point of view:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove as much unwanted noise as possible trough filtering. Hobbyists wrote a lot of AviSynth filters for different kinds of material years ago. Unfortunately AviSynth is a bit difficult to setup and handle on it's target platform Windows, running Linux makes it even a bit more difficult.\n\n\n*\n\n*Update: A rewrite of AviSynth that runs natively on Linux is now available named VapourSynth. Most of the filters have already been ported and improved or replaced with better alternatives.\n\n\n*Choose a reasonable video resolution and quality level for the target device (even if there are devices with 5 inch 1080p displays out there, it's not necessary to encode with bluray settings or bluray like quality settings) or let the user decide (see YouTube).\n\n*Use as less bitrate as possible (e.g. \"make your videos starve bitrate\") while maintaining the desired quality (modern video encoders support zones, so that you can control the bitrate and quality for manually specified scenes).\n\n\nYou may be asking: Is there a program that will automagically do these things for me?\nWell, a program could use a certain set well defined defaults and run algorithms on the results to compute the signal to noise ratio and try to apply a lot of proven methods for the given material, but there is a certain kind of craftsmanship that a program cannot do (today). I don't know if such programs currently exist.\nAll in all: Video encoding can be quite difficult if you go to deep, because you want to achieve a certain result.\nSome folks at video.stackexchange.com may be more of help to you with video related problem like filtering out certain artifacts.\n\nA: I had same problem with the one of my video that i have recorded with digicam ,, it was more than 400 mb ... \nI used winff which can be downloaded very easily from ubuntu software center. it convert my video from 400 mb to only 30 mb. but i notice slight quality loss tough,,, \n\nA: Handbrake is easiest. Choose the vid for source, then click on \"Android\" or \"iPod\" in the preset lists at right side of screen [this changes the geometry, resulting in smaller file for the small phone screen].

I think I'm having difficulty fully understanding subvolumes and snapshots.\nThe /home partition is btrfs. I want to create a \"backup\" snapshot of /home/user (for example) but user has existed for years (previously ext4 > btrfs-convert). I believe you can only make a snapshot of a subvolume. I checked and there are no \"default\" subvolumes already present. \n1) Is there another way for me to backup /home/user other than creating a subvolume /home/user2 and copying everything from user to user2 in order to snapshot it?\n\nA: It is perfectly reasonable to just snapshot the whole /home if you want /home/user to be backed up. snapshots are relatively cheep.  \nbtrfs snapshot create /home/ /home/snapshot\n\nIn Btrfs the base unit of a snapshot is the subvolume (/mount-point/ is automatically a subvolume) and you cant snapshot anything smaller. In this case your /home is the smallest thing you can snapshot. You will likely never run into problems with snapshotting all of /home and if someday you do then you're method of creating a subvolume and copying into it will work to. there is a good chance that by then btrfs will be able to create snapshots of plain old directories anyway. \n\nA: You can create reflinks in a backup directory to everything under /home/user, which is very similar to what a snapshot is. For example you could run something like cp -rax --reflink /home/user /backup/home/user. (Both /home/user and /backup/home/user need to be on the same btrfs volume.) \nThis will copy the directory structure and the inodes (meta-data), but the inodes will point to the same extents (containing the actual file content) as the original files. Since the actual file contents are not copied, this takes up less disk space and runs much faster than actually coping the full files. When the original file changes, the new data will be written to new extents, so the backup will still contain the old data.\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot a wireless networking regression? I've been experiencing this perhaps slightly odd bug.\nIt works flawlessly in Lucid, but not in Maverick and Natty. I find it seems to work when I'm booting a partition everyday (as I do for my main 10.10 partition) but for my 11.04 testing partition it's a real pain - usually refusing to connect.\nI think the problem might be due to the PSK authentication/encryption my router is using, but I don't really know anything about this.\nSo given that I have both a working (10.04) and not-working (10.10 and 11.04) installs, how can I troubleshoot my problem?\n\nA: Determine where the regression is: Test Maverick with the Lucid kernel and vice versa, and also test kernels from the mainline PPA. If you can make it work in Maverick with an older kernel and break in Lucid with a newer kernel, it's a kernel regression. If not, it's a problem in the userland.\nIf it is a kernel regression, determine the newest working kernel and then perform a git bisection to find the exact commit where it stopped working.\nIf it is a userland bug you will have to dig into the packages involved with wireless.\n", "Q: Suspend fails and I know the module causing it. What can I do? My suspend did not correctly since I installed a USB 3 extension card in my PC. Instead of going to S3, the computer just woke up instantly. dmesg gave the hint \"usb_dev_suspend+0x0/0x20 returns -2\" so I rmmod'ed the \"xhci_hcd\" module which did the trick.\nIs there a good way for me to work around this? The builds from the Kernel Mainline PPA did not help, unfortunately, and blacklisting the module is not my favorite option. Where is the best place for me to report this issue?\n\nA: This is a known bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/522998\nFrom there:\n\nIf SUSPEND_MODULES=\"xhci\" is added to /etc/pm/config.d/unload_module then the system can suspend normally. \n\nAnd a comment on there also points at Post #7 of this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1444822\nSimilar stuff and lots of people saying it works. Hopefully it will.\n\nA: In addition to what Oli said in that post, there are known troubles if you have a built-in media card reader or if you have mounted USB (flash or rotating) storage at the time of the suspend request.\nAdd a script /etc/pm/sleep.d/00_fixMounted.sh and make it owned by root and executable.\nThis script should perform umount on any mounted media-card and USB storage. On Ubuntu, they are mounted at /mnt/media/* by default.\nI made considerable progress removing module \"usb_storage\" after un-mount.\nThere are other known troubles with USB connected devices like cameras and such. The above would handle any storage components of those devices, but you would need to de-activate the other parts somehow separately.\nBonne chance,\n~~~ 0;-Dan\n\nA: See Maco's answer to this question, which outlines how to blacklist (well, remove really) the module when you suspend, then reload it when you resume.\nAs a follow up, you can you see my specific edit to the /etc/default/acpi-support file in this answer.\nNo guarantees with this stuff though.  You might have to experiment a bit to get it all working.  In some cases, (a Sony Viao WLAN card), I can't get the hardware to resume at all after suspend, regardless of how I edit this file.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Nowadays you would put script in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ instead of /etc/pm/sleep.d.

I am just wondering, how do I get smooth scrolling in Nautilus? \n\nA: This feature is not available in Nautilus, sorry.\n\nA: Use a recent version of Nautilus that includes smooth scrolling (introduced in GTK 3 or so). Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 have smooth scrolling in Nautilus and other GTK3 apps.\n\nA: I'm not a programer but I'm not sure it's a gtk+ problem, it seems more like a mouse configuration problem. If you scroll down with the mouse wheel it scrolls jumping 3 lines each little movement you do (sorry I can explain it better, my english...) but if you scroll down by clicking the side bar and dragging it down, the scrolling is perfectly smooth.\nWhat I mean is, it CAN be a smooth scroll, the problem is in the way the scrolling is made trough the mouse wheel.

From left to right, the Windows partitions are one partition for Windows booting, one for Windows OS and software installation, and one for data which is planned to mount on Ubuntu. \nI was wondering how to arrange the order of partitions of root, home and swap, i.e. which is on the left just besides one Windows partition, which is in the middle and which is on the far right? Is there some consideration regarding about this arrangement?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: It doesn't matter where your partitions are. You can have root be on a primary or logical partition. You can have root, home, and boot all smushed together on one partition, or micromanage all your folders to different partitions (you might hit a built-in limit for logical partitions (~59?), and you're only allowed four primary). I think you could even have all your partitions running on a networked file share.\nI've always partitioned boot as my first logical partition, because I know I'm only going to give it 100 mB. Then I think about making a swap, and usually decide against it. Next I decide how much space I'll give up to root. Finally, I give home the rest of the space. If I'm not dual booting Windows, root gets to be in a primary partition. Everything else gets logical partitions.\nSee TLDP for more info:\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/intro.html#explanation\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/partition-types.html\n\nA: The only consideration is that the disk tends to be faster near the start, and slower near the end.

Regarding machines with intel 32-bit processors (i386/i686)\nMost probably in case of intel 32-bit machines and Ubuntu 10.4 installed on it the only one library (libstdc++5_3.3.6-20~lucid1_i386.deb, note at the moment of writing the version is higher) is necessary and it has to be placed in /usr/lib directory \nPart 3. Why there is lib64 on 32-bit machine is still not clear, any comments are highly appreciated.\n", "Q: Racing MMO - 2D or 3D - Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Games I really like multiplayer racing games, like Need for Speed World or similar.\nI wonder if there is any MMO racing game for Ubuntu (2D or 3D). Browser-based games are also accepted.\nNote:\nI tried this question in the Gaming Q&A of StackExchange (see link below), but one user said that my question was off-topic.\nhttps://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/16329/racing-mmo-for-linux-2d-or-3d-massively-multiplayer-online-racing-games\n\nA: The only native MMO close to racing is Darkwind: War on Wheels.\n\nDarkwind: War on Wheels is an independently developed 3D turn based racing and vehicle combat massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is inspired by the tabletop game Car Wars and the Mad Max movies, but set in its own original universe.\n\nAlso you can try other racing MMOGs in wine.  (p.s. nfs world doesn't work)\n", "Q: How can I have 1 image stretch across multiple workspaces? Basically, I have a quad-monitor wallpaper that I want to stretch across all of my workspaces (1 monitor), I have compiz manager installed, but can't seem to get the single image to fill the entire cube. How should I go about this?\n\nA: This could be accomplished by splitting the image into four different images and adding a different one on each desktop.\nYou could use a variety of different things to split the images. Using ImageMagick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*If ImageMagick isn't installed yet, install it: sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n*Split it! convert imagename.png -crop 25%x100% imagename-%02d.png\n25% was used above based on a setup of four desktops.

Is it Possible to? or is it an emesene problem?, is there a plug in or a workaround?\n\nA: Actually there is no way for an external app to integrate with the MeMenu(if you mean the \"place\" where you can change your status). So it's not completely an emesene's fault.\nBy the way there could be a solution and i'll force the emesene's guys to fix that.\n\nA: I don't know if this is it you are looking for but here is a workaround. \nEdit: this ppa's emesene is also said to be integrated with messaging menu.\n", "Q: How do you fix file permissions for root directory? What is the best way to fix Ubuntu's Root file system permissions?  \nI was changing file permissions on a whole bunch of files that needed to be removed, I had accidentally changed the permissions for /, /etc, /var, /home, /bin, /media and all the files underneath. majority of them were changed to 0777. All this because I added a space to chmod command that I was running.\nNow I am running into issues with stuff not working correctly and unable to log into root with either su or sudo. So administration from the desktop is not possible, and trying to get into grubs OS selection is also impossible, because last upgrade for some reason turned it off the menu when it boots. Any kind of admin action is nearly impossible to do because of this.\nIs there a script I can run in the root shell that will fix it or should I just re-install Ubuntu? Are there any other things that I can do to fix this other then changing each directory and file to the correct permissions?\nI am currently running Ubuntu 10.10 64bit \n\nA: here is a basic idea I hope you are looking for. I think most file system have permission of 755 for folders and 644 for files except for /bin which has executable files with root as owner.\n", "Q: Why does sudo ask for a password in window after I've just authenticated in a different one? If I am using the command line in xterm, gnome-terminal, etc., I can keep sudo from re-prompting for a password, within some limits, or I can disable it.\nAs a compromise between usability and security, I usually just want this re-querying wait-time lengthened.\nBy default, there is only a 15 minute grace-period after entering a sudo password before it prompts for it again.  To change this to 45 minutes, I can edit /etc/sudoers, and set timestamp_timeout to the waiting period I want (in minutes) .  \n\nIf I am within the same terminal session, and start a new shell (typing in csh or bash) the wait period is respected.\nBut if I go to another window to access the command line there, it will immediately ask for my password if I try to sudo.   \nWithin the same pseudoterminal session (pts)  (for example, if I spawn a new shell inside the same gnome-terminal window), the timeout is respected. \nIf I launch a new xterm, gnome-terminal, etc., I must enter credentials again.  \nDespite being the only user active on my home system (a single-user system), etc., sudo doesn't trust that all of my pts entries are from the same user: \n~/pseudoland$ w\n 01:27:39 up 1 day, 15:03,  7 users,  load average: 0.32, 0.71, 0.77\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\njgb    tty1                      23:56    1:30m  0.55s  0.51s -bash\njgb    tty7     :0               Tue10   39:03m  2:28m  0.76s gnome-session\nroot     pts/1    :0.0             00:30   56:23   0.01s  0.01s /bin/bash\njgb    pts/3    :0.0             01:16    0.00s  0.59s  3.22s gnome-terminal\njgb    pts/4    :0.0             01:27   26.00s  0.23s  0.23s /bin/bash\njgb    pts/5    :0.0             01:17    9:26   0.23s  0.23s bash\n\nIs there a way to tell sudo that it should regard all the windows I open as coming from the same user, and to not ask again for my password if the last sudo timer hasn't expired?\n\nA: The grace period is controlled by what sudo calls a 'ticket'. When you authenticate with sudo, it creates this ticket with a certain timestamp that basically says when the authentication should expire.\nBy default (this is set when the package is compiled), this timeout is, as you've found, per tty. This is a feature of sudo called 'tty_tickets'. Basically this means that, instead of creating one lock per user, sudo creates one lock per tty instead.\nIn order to revert back to the old behaviour and override the default, you need to edit /etc/sudoers. Find the \"Defaults\" line, which you already edited to change the timeout, and append ,!tty_tickets to it. This will turn off the tty_tickets feature and give you the behaviour you want.\n", "Q: How to set up USB for Virtualbox? I'm using Ubuntu Maverick and Virtual Box 3+. I have Windows 7 Ultimate. The problem is that it doesn't detect USB drives in Windows 7, but USB peripherals (mouse + keybord) are working.\nI followed these instructions, but I can't find the user group vboxusers. How can I continue? I would also like to upgrade to the latest version without any risk (without losing my virtual hard disk drive).\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, after the initial install with \nsudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nI also had to:\nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER\nsudo apt install virtualbox-ext-pack\n\nThen I could enable USB 2/3 support in the machine settings.\nWhat the virtualbox-ext-pack actually does, is download the required files from http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox and prompt you to accept the license before installing.\n\nA: I had the same problem. After trying all the other solutions I realised my problem.\nI had downloaded virtualbox from the Ubuntu Software Center, which didn't have the latest version of virtualbox, so I had accidently downloaded the wrong version of \"Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack\".\nSolution: \n\n\n*\n\n*open virtualbox, click help, click about, find your virtualbox version number.\n\n*Goto https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3 (replace \"4_3\" with your version).\n\n*Download the \"Extension Pack\" that matches your virtualbox version.\n\n*Install that, and it might ask you if you would like to downgrade, click yes.\n\n\nWorked for me anyway.\n\nA: I had the same problem and fixed it by clicking in the VirtualBox group of my user. You can access it installing gnome-system-tools (it does not come with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin), either via the Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic or by typing in the terminal: \nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\nRemember that to paste in the terminal you have to use Ctrl+Shift+V, as opposed to Ctrl+V. \nYou will probably have to enter your password to allow the installation and add a Y (as in yes) to finish installing the packages. \nThen you head to your Dash home and type users. You will see two applications. The good one is Users and Groups. \nYou then have to click on Advanced settings for your user and enter your password.\nNow you will be shown a window with three tabs. Click on User Privileges.  Find the line that says Use Virtualbox virtualization solution and then OK. \n\nYou may be asked to enter your password again. Then click on Close and log-out and log-in again. \nWhen you start VirtualBox, you should see a whole bunch of new USB devices. \nGood luck!\n\nA: If you can list your USB devices being root, but not as a regular user (despite being in the group vboxusers), it may be related to a reached limit of monitored files. \nYou need to increase the maximum number of files your programs are allowed to monitor (inotify). If you have a client that synchronizes your files (dropbox, seafile, etc.), the limit can be reached and the USB devices cannot be listed. It is reported as a bug issue here.\nEdit /etc/sysctl.conf and increase the limit to 524288. it can be done as mentioned here, like this:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl -p\n\nThe USB devices should appear doing (as a user or root):\nVBoxManage list usbhost\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install gnome-system-tools b/c The old Users and Groups GUI is not available by default on 11.10\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\n\n*After the installation finished Open  user and groups from launcher\n\n*Select your username click on Manage Groups and select vboxusers and click add.\n \n\n\n*\n\n*logout/login to be able to use USB in VirtualBox. \n\n\nA: 1. Install Extension Pack\nalso see: How do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack?\nUSB 1.0 is supported in the version installed from the Ubuntu repositories (from VirtualBox > 4.x).\nFor USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 we need to install the free (but closed source) VirtualBox Extension Pack (NOT the \"platform packages\") from the VirtualBox download page. If you had installed VirtualBox from the repositories you have to make sure to choose the extension pack for the right version of VirtualBox. You can see the version of your installed VirtualBox in the help > About VirtualBox menu. For regular updates and bug fixes, it is recommended to install the most recent VirtualBox version from the Oracle repository.\n\nAll virtual machines need to be powered off before installing the extension.\n\n2. Become a \"vboxuser\" in Host machine (local machine)\nTo be able to get access to an attached USB device, the Ubuntu host user needs to be in the vboxusers group. Add your user to this group by running the following command\nsudo usermod -aG vboxusers <username> \n\nand reboot or logout/login.\n3. Activate USB support in VirtualBox Manager\nShut down your virtual machine and open USB settings in the VirtualBox Manager. Tick Enable USB Controllerand USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller or USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller.\n\nIf these settings are greyed out, you need to shut down the virtual machine.\n\n\n4. Select host USB device for access from the guest\nTo grant access to USB devices we need to select a device to disable in the host and to enable in the guest (this is a precaution to avoid simultaneous access from host and guest). This can be done from the panel Devices menu or by right mouse click in the bottom panel of the VirtualBox Manager on the USB icon:\n\nTick the device you need in the guest, untick it if you need it in the host. If you can't see your USB device in that list, it means that VirtualBox cannot access your host USB devices. Make sure your user is added to the vboxusers group and that you restarted your host.\nThe selected device will immediately be accessible from the guest. A Windows guest may need additional drivers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 needs an additional driver for USB 3.0 support.\n\n*Windows 10 does not accept an NTFS formatted USB pen drive.\n\n\n\n[optional] Use USB filters for permanent access in the guest\nBy defining USB filters we can define USB devices that will automatically be presented to the guest when booting the guest OS.\n\nClick on the green + symbol on the right to add a known device. \n\nNote, that some devices may lead to a boot failure of the guest. We can not use these devices for filters.\n\nRead more on USB support in the VirtualBox User Manual.\nAlso see: what are the proper values for usb device in virtual box\n\nA: The vboxusers will be in the /etc/group file.  You edit it with something like nano . \nsudo nano /etc/group\nAdd your user to the vboxusers line, or create one if necessary.\nAs Takkat has pointed out, to get full USB device support, you'll need to install the full version of Virtualbox (not the OSE). \nThe ppa I have for the \"official\" virtualbox is here: \n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox-offical-source.list:  \ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian maverick contrib #VirtualBox Offical Source\n\n\nA: My solution was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off virtual machine\n\n*Download the right extension pack\n\n*Install extension pack\n\n*Start virtual machine, put in Virtualbox guest additions and install them. If already installed, repeat the installation\n\n*Shut down virtual machine\n\n*Go to Settings>USB as shown in the images above and enable USB\n\n*Boot virtual machine\n\n\nIf not working, restart your whole host system and try again. Worked fine for me.\nWatch out: At the first boot of the guest system after installing the guest additions, you will see all usb devices to choose, but it can take up to 10 minutes until the Windows guest activates them after you checked them. Just wait patiently.\n\nA: For me on Kubuntu 16.04 (with virtualbox 5.0.24-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.1 installed via apt) I had used VirtualBox before with USB passthrough working. However, I was no longer part of the virtualbox group (checked with cat /etc/group | grep vboxusers) and so used kdesudo kuser to add myself (can be done with sudo usermod -a -G virtualbox $USER too). \nI then needed to logout and back in again to use the new group listings and authorise my access. \nNow when doing VboxManage list usbhost it returns the usb devices instead of just \"none\"; also in the settings on VirtualBox I can choose connected USB devices to passthrough to the virtual OS. Yay!\n", "Q: Using a displaylink usb video adapter I just bought this USB graphics adapter and I need to use it on Ubuntu 10.10. I followed this guide, but when I ran\n$ ./configure && sudo make install && make check\n\nnothing happened.

I keep a second user on my host that I use to cross-check if the problem is system related or user related: in the first case both users will show problems, in the latter only one or the other. If the problem is user dependent, then it will be something wrong in the home folder. With pulse audio is then ~/.pulse or ~/.config/pulse. renaming those, as for example _broken, allows pulseaudio to regenerate them correctly if you logout and back in. It work most of the time with me.\n\nA: HUZZAH\nRight. arecord was the dodgy looking element here that I eventually found through fusering the sound files (see my question for my process). But I couldn't find what was causing arecord to start as root on boot. Here's how I did that:\n\n*\n\n*Run pstree | less\n\n*In that, type /arecord and press return to find the arecord process.\n\n*Press up once and you'll see its parent. In my case this was randomsound.\n\nI installed randomsound a few days ago to generate extra entropy (for regenerating /dev/random) using my sound card. I had completely forgotten it was installed and I guess this was the first time I restarted since installing it.\nIn short sudo apt-get remove randomsound fixed it. PulseAudio can now grab my sound card and I can listen to some trashy europop while I work.\n\nA: While I searched for hours and hours online for an answer, I tried rebooting ect.. Nothing worked, until I typed this command:\n\nsudo killall arecord\n\nfixed my sound, I have been looking for solutions for this problem everywhere, so I thought I would post my solution. Good luck!\n", "Q: How can I make a live CD/DVD from my harddisk installation? How can I make a live CD/DVD from my harddisk installation?\nIn other words, I would like to create a boot CD from Ubuntu that is installed on my PC, because I want to include the updated packages in it.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Install UCK - tool to customize Ubuntu Live CDs: \nsudo apt-get install uck\n\n\nA: I just made one for myself a few hours ago! I used RemasterSys. The steps to install are given on the page. After installing it, you can type the following commands on a terminal:\nsudo remastersys dist my-hd.iso\nto create a distributable image named my-hd.iso. You can burn this on a DVD and share it around. Just make sure you have removed crud like cached packages, unused config files. On a terminal type \nsudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt get autoclean \nAgain, if you are not a commandline guy, install Ubuntu Tweak to clean old packages, kernels and other crud from your system.\nIf comamnd line isnt for you, then you can goto Gnome Menu > Admninistration > Remastersys Backup.\nThere is also a guide given on Ubuntu.com, if you are willing to DIY.\n\nA: This should do the trick:\nhttp://remastersys.sourceforge.net/remastersystool.html\n", "Q: How to distort images Is it possible to distort an image with open source software on Ubuntu?\nI know I can skew and stretch, but how can I do something like this?\nBasically, imagine all those images being a single png file, how would I give it that curved effect?\n\nA: Ubuntu has an excellent image editing software called GIMP. You can goto the software center, and search for GIMP.  As for warping, I think you can do it. \n", "Q: Running a webbrowser on the screen saver or login screen? I would really like people to be able to use my locked computer to surf, so I would like some way to run a browser on login screen. So can I make GDM run Firefox in some way? It would be cooler if I could have a browser as a screensaver, but that seems a bit harder.\nPlease ignore all the security problems with this, if you let someone use your computer you have lost that race anyways. Though of course it would be nice to have a browser running as another user.\n\nA: There might be a way to do what you are thinking BUT\nThere are also some extensions for firefox that allow you to have the web browser open full screen and lock like a web kiosk at malls and schools and stuff\nthen it requires a password to close I believe \nhope this helps\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kiosk-browser-symbio-technolog/ \n\nA: Why don't you create a guest account that you switch to (as opposed to logging out or locking). Your account will stay active and locked, and they can browse the web or play solitaire..\n\nA: This may be overkill, but you asked for a browser running at login (I'd go for @djeikyb's answer):\nAs @djeikyb suggested, create a surf-only user but then let him start with a user defined session (see also this answer) with e.g. this lines in the ~/.xsession file:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ngnome-desktop &\nfirefox\nlogout\n\nIn this example Firefox will start on login. When Firefox quits we will be back at the GDM login. Firefox may start in fullscreen mode e.g. with addons @ScottC suggested to hide the desktop. Alternatively remove all unwanted desktop elements for this user.\nTo handle things easy you may also define a keyboard shortcut for fast user switching.\n\nA: If it's still actual ... just add browser's launcher to \n/usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow\nand it will start automatically on the login page. Hope this will be helpful.\n\nA: I am in total agreeance with the \"nothing else on the screen\" design principle.  This seems like an awful headache to go through, to protect your computer from careless users.  If you have a problem with people posting drunken messages to your contacts, you should not be trying to cater to them.  This is not, in fact, 1992.  If your troublemakers can't afford some of the world's cheaper computer solutions, they don't deserve to be doing anything but trying harder to pull their weight.\n..but this whole browser, solitaire, etc in the login screen/screensaver thing is just a bad idea.\n\nA: set firefox as a startup application for guest-session and run\nxautolock  -notify 10 -notifier 'notify-send \"Screen will lock and  switch to guest in 10 seconds\"' -time 1 -locker \"dm-tool switch-to-guest\"\n\n", "Q: How to avoid openSSH showing authentication popup? When pushing a bzr repo to another server, I need to type an openSSH password. \nAfter I typed it, an openSSH popup appears, and requires the password again. \nAny way to avoid this?\n\nA: The thing is, that even with an SSH key, if you put a passcode on the ssh key you use, it'll require you to enter your passcode to unlock the key once during your login session (unless otherwise configured).  This is a security measure that some people enable so that others cant utilize their system nor their SSH key on their own system.\nEDIT\nIn order to fix this, you'd need to edit your SSH key (if you use one) so that it does not require a passcode, and seahorse (the GUI for key management and things) will help you do that.  I strongly recommend you don't remove your passcode from your SSH key (if that IS the thing that's causing the popups, and I'm pretty sure it is)\n\nA: By saying \"password\", I assume this means you don't have an SSH key.\nThe easiest way to make this work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window and run ssh-keygen\n\n*Accept the default location\n\n*Enter a password or passphrase twice (passphrase is like a password, but can contain spaces)\n\n*Run ssh-copy-id OTHERSERVER and enter your password\n\n*Run ssh OTHERSERVER\nNow, it should ask you for the passphrase you typed.\nAfter that, gnome-keyring-daemon or ssh-agent will remember your passphrase until you log out.\n\nA: You may find GPG Agent useful - see Tips and Tricks page on Ubuntu Community Help\n", "Q: How do I sync Evolution's \"Sent\" folder? Is there any way to sync the Sent folder in Evolution in Ubuntu One? Received items are updated from the mail server as I leave them there 7 days before deletion, but I need to keep my sent items on each computer too.\n\nA: Evolution by default stores the send mails for every account you create on a local folder to your computer. This folder can be accessed either by the evolution interface (\"On this computer --> Sent\") or by navigating to /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/.evolution/mail/local and locating the file named \"Sent\". (This file is actually a .mbox file and you can even open it with gedit!) \nSo to sync this file with Ubuntu One just add a cron script to copy that .mbox file to your Ubuntu One folder. I give you an example of running the copy process every 5 minutes:\n$gksu gedit /etc/crontab\n\nadd at the end of that file :\n*/5 * * * *  YOUR_USERNAME_HERE  cp /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/.evolution/mail/local/Sent /home/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/Ubuntu\\ One/\n\nreplaces YOUR_USERNAME_HERE in the command above.\n", "Q: Which window has current focus? I'd like to know (programmatically) which window has current focus. Is there a window-manager independent way of discovering that?\nOtherwise, how does one determine which window has focus in Compiz or Metacity?\n\nA: What you want is libwnck (if you're just interested in windows) or libbamf (if you're interested in windows and the applications that own them).\n\nA: Another thing you can use is xdotool:\nxdotool getwindowfocus\nwould return the Window ID of the focussed window, and:\nxdotool getwindowfocus getwindowname\nwould tell you its name.\n\nA: try using the wnck lib and then use this code:\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\n\nwhile True:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    screen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n    screen.force_update()\n    while True:\n        while gtk.events_pending():\n            gtk.main_iteration()\n        #time.sleep(0.5)\n        print screen.get_active_window().get_name()\n\n\nA: If you're happy doing a little X11 programming, then the EWMH spec is what you're after - specifically _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW.\n\nA: Well if you can ping something back to the shell:\nxdpyinfo | grep focus\n\nShould work.\nEdit: For slightly cleaner output, try this:\nxdpyinfo | grep -Eo 'window 0x[^,]+' | cut -d\" \" -f2\n\n\nA: From  info xtool: \ngetactivewindow\n   Output the current active window.

I am interested in knowing which options are used to compile vim in the package \"vim\" as I am trying to compile vim from source on another system, not running Debian/Ubuntu, and would like it to work in a similar way.\n\nA: Grab the source package\napt-get source vim\n\nThat'll download the source for the package in your current dir. Look at debian/rules, which is a makefile used when creating all the different vim packages. It may be hard to read, but the information you seek should be in there somewhere.\nYou can also download the source package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/trusty/vim (scroll down) if you can't log into a debian/ubuntu box to run apt-get.\n\nA: vim --version will list all the options in ubuntu.             \n\nA: Version command in vim reports compile options.:version\n", "Q: Bash scripts will not run without typing \"bash\" in front of it On our school system, we're able to run script files without typing bash or csh or what have you without indicating what script type it is. On Ubuntu, however, I'm required to type bash script.bash for example. Is this always necessary in Ubuntu, or is it some setting I can change?\n\nA: Make sure the first line of the file reads:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIf the shebang is #!/bin/sh, you should not use any bash-specific features, only POSIX features. Even if /bin/sh is a symlink to bash, bash will run in a POSIX compatibility mode when run as sh, disabling some (but not all) bash features.\nYou'll also need to make sure the script is executable, of course.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you start the script with ./script or full path or whatever. Just script may not work (it works if the directory is in $PATH, like /usr/bin), since on UNIX systems it's not a habit to have the current directory in your path (for security reasons, and it's good!)\n\n*Make sure the script is executable, for example: chmod +x script will made it executable.\n\n*Make sure, you have #!/bin/bash as the first line in your script. Also make sure, that it's not edited with some kind of Windows editor, since those often uses the \"DOS type\" of eol (end of line) which differs from the UNIX one (if the checklist above is OK, but you got \"bad interpreter: no such file or directory\" or so, even if it's /bin/bash, this is often the reason, as the non-printable - so you usually don't see it - \\r will be treated as the part of the path of the interpreter)\nOthers already mentioned: it's important to have /bin/bash if you use bash features, also /bin/sh was symlinked to /bin/bash, but now-a-days (as far as I noticed) it's symlinked to dash which won't provide bash compatibility, only the POSIX sh. It's quite important, even quite expensive softwares at our firm have this issue: scripts contain #!/bin/sh as the first line but it depends on bash functionalities as well.\n\nA: An alternative, strongly discouraged way is adding . to PATH.\nPATH=\".:$PATH\"\n\nor\nPATH=\"$PATH:.\"\n\nThe problem with this approach is that in the former case, any system command could be overridden with executables from the current directory, and in the latter case, unknown commands could still be overridden.\nConsider the following:\nFile: ls\n#!/bin/bash\n\n./my_malicious_script &>/dev/null\n/bin/ls \"$@\"\n\nMost likely you wouldn't even notice until it's too late.\n", "Q: Why doesn't this wildcard work the way I expect?

For other non-option\n  arguments, by default `ls' lists just\n  the file name.  If no non-option\n  arguments are specified, 'ls' lists\n  the contents of the current directory.\n\nso when yo give ls d*, d* is expanded to sorted list of all file/directory names starting with d. So you command becomes \nls dump\n\nand as dump is a directory name so you get the listing of all files in the directory \"dump'\nbut when you give ls D*, D* is expanded to \"Desktop Documents Downloads Dropbox\", so the command becomes\nls Desktop Documents Downloads Dropbox\n\nand as all of these are directories, you get the listing of files in individual directory. If there was a file starting with D in current directory it would have been listed seperately.\n\nA: As suggested above, -d option is way to go.  Adding\nalias ld='ls -d'\n\nto my ~/.bashrc file works well for me.\n", "Q: SCP not working with a .ppk key so I need to connect to a remote server. Remote server is running Debian, I am on Ubuntu Lucid -- and a noob in SSH.\nI need a public key to connect to the remote server. The key has been created as a PuTTY Pageant File (.ppk). I used putty-tools to convert the .ppk key to Linux files (namely, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub).

Thanks!\nEdit: it's working now! Not really sure why... How is that passphrase system working with SSH? Does it keep the passphrase in th terminal's memory? This time I've connected to SSH in one terminal tab. I was prompted my passphrase, entered it and got in. Then on another terminal tab, I tried to scp a file and I've been asked the passphrase and it worked!....\n\nA: Is id_rsa in ~/.ssh? This is where ssh and scp looks for the private keys.\nAlso if your using a private key you shouldn't be prompted for a password, this would suggests that it is not being used, and also that it is not required.\nI'm also confused as to why your using putty if both systems are Linux.\n\nA: Following the advice of Mikel (thanks!) I ran with the -v option and received a stinging reminder that I was trying to run scp as root. Silly me, I had set up all the shared key credentials in the home directory of the non-root user. \nAfter severely chastising myself, then going to /root/.ssh and copying three files from /home//.ssh, my efforts were met with success.\nJBR\n", "Q: Which MPI package should I install? I want to attempt some simple programs using MPI on my desktop which runs KUbuntu 10.04.2.  Which MPI package should I install?\n\nA: If it's just for simple usage on your own system, OpenMPI is very nice, as it doesn't require any setup after installation, just running your application with mpirun is sufficient.\nsudo aptitude install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin\n\n\nA: There's a great Guide in the Ubuntu Community Help on using the MPICH2 implementation of the MPI. It's a bit old (the Guide I mean), but it should still work as described. \nThe specific package you're interested in there is  mpich2.\n", "Q: Can you install Ubuntu from the hard disk? Is it possible to install Ubuntu from the hard disk?\n\nA: Yes.\nUbuntu can be installed from hard disk without using any secondary media like CD or USB.\nYou can read the full tutorial here.\nhttp://agnipulse.com/2011/08/install-ubuntu-hard-disk/\nGrub4Dos bootloader is used to boot from the Ubuntu iso on the hard disk.After booting, the isodevice is unmounted by running some commands in the terminal.Then you can install Ubuntu the normal way.\n\nA: There is a way for Windows Vista / 7 users. Download the Ubuntu iso file you want to install, and use EasyBCD. Open EasyBCD and click \"Add New Entry\" from the left side. Then on the bottom, select \"ISO Boot\" and then find the ISO file you want to boot from. Then give it a name, click \"Add Entry,\" and then Restart. There should be an option (when you boot) to boot from the entry you just made.\n\nA: Here is an Ubuntu help page on installing Ubuntu from another Linux partition. Essentially you just get the installer's .iso image, extract it onto a new partition, then boot from it to start the installer. EDIT: This method gave me installer errors about partitioning because I had a USB drive plugged in that I wasn't using. I didn't want to use the USB drive for the installer because I didn't want to delete its existing contents. After removing the USB drive this method worked fine.\nIf you don't have another Linux partition, here is an Ubuntu help page on other ways to install\n\nA: Actually, I installed Ubuntu on 2 computers via Wubi and almost no problems. The only problem is that it doesn't detect the other partitions from Ubuntu because of the way it is installed(in a file allocated on the hard drive) which is pretty bad...\n\nA: Yes you can use Wubi\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi\n", "Q: Is there any way to make the window resizing less sensitive? \nPossible Duplicates:\nHow do I increase resize Margin on windows?\nWhy are window borders so hard to click in Ambiance? \n\nIt seems like it's very difficult on this computer to get the mouse right at the corner of a window so that I can resize it. My other box seems much less sensitive. Is there a way to change that setting?\n\nA: The problem is the border size of the windows. The default theme in Ubuntu has a very narrow border. You can change the windows border theme in \"System, Preferences, Appearance\". However, I haven't found a theme I like better than the default, so I've taken to using a shortcut I saw posted somewhere else. You can also resize a window by holding down the Alt key and using your middle mouse button. There's some dead space in the middle of the window using this method. Just be near the edge you want to resize, and it will work. Then you don't have to grab the single pixel of the border. ;-)\n", "Q: Quickly template for PyQt?

What I have done is moved both panels to the bottom of the screen and added a bunch of icons / widgets etc.\nHowever I am finding often that when I login sometimes my panels have been restored to the default state with the icon panel at the top but with nothing other than the Firefox icon.\nAlso sometimes the panels are in the correct place but all the icons have been removed from at least one of the panels.\nThis is quite irritating as I seem to have to spend time setting my entire panel up again at least once every 2 days or so.\nAlso my wine applications (such as Spotify) used to be able to dock in the main notification area, now they are docked in a separate \"wine dock\" which hovers on the desktop, this is not really ideal as I prefer to keeps these in one place.\nIn my $HOME/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers folder there seems to be a bunch of symlinks which appear to be the icons that I would usually have on my panel, but they are not visible on the panel.\nOther than this all my profile settings and application settings do not seem to have been lost or changed, just the panels.\nI can't seem to find much evidence of anyone else having this problem and I've never had it before so I am confused as to why this has started happening and what I can do to prevent it.\n\nA: alt+f2 type : gconf-editor\napps--->\npanel-->\nglobal->\nThen Check \"locked_down\"\nIt should prevent the panels from further change\nbut you must uncheck it to change things on the panels\n\nA: You could also use this handy utility to save and restore your settings via a handy script with a simple GUI, or restore the default Ubuntu panels.\nhttp://www.starryhope.com/linux/ubuntu/2010/restore-the-default-panels-in-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Can scripts run even when they are not set as executable? I can seem to run scripts (.sh) with and without them being set as executable. So where exactly this matters?\n\nA: Let's say you have the file myscript containing the following:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n\nIf you make this file executable and run it with ./myscript, then the kernel will see that the first two bytes are #!, which means it's a script-file. The kernel will then use the rest of the line as the interpreter, and pass the file as its first argument. So, it runs:\n/bin/bash myscript\n\nand bash reads the file and executes the commands it contains.\nThus, for bash (or whatever interpreter your script requires) to \"execute\" the script, it only needs to be able to read the file.\nSo, for scripts, the execute bit just makes it a bit more convenient to execute it. As long as bash is executable, you can always run bash with the script file as argument, or run bash interactively and copy paste the script line by line into your terminal to have the commands executed.\n\nA: The exec syscall of the Linux kernel fails with EACCES if the file is not executable\nWhile you can do sh myprog.sh (which just reads the files and interprets is), trying to run the program as ./myprog.sh cannot work, since when you do that:\n\n*\n\n*your Bash shell on the terminal uses the exec system call on ./myprog.sh\n\n*the shebangs are interpreted directly by the exec system call of the Linux kernel as explained at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2429511/why-do-people-write-the-usr-bin-env-python-shebang-on-the-first-line-of-a-pyt/40938801#40938801\n\n*the Linux kernel refuses to execute files without executable permission\n\nThis can be verified with main.c:\n#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    char *argv[] = {\"myprog\", NULL};\n    char *envp[] = {NULL};\n    int ret;\n    ret = execve(\"myprog.sh\", argv, envp);\n    perror(\"execve\");\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", errno);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", EACCES);\n}\n\nand myprog.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\necho worked\n\nIf myprog.sh is not executable, main fails with:\nexecve: Permission denied\n13\n13\n\nTested in Ubuntu 17.10, gcc -std=c99.\nPOSIX 7 mentions that at:\n\nThe exec functions, except for fexecve(), shall fail if:\n[EACCES]\nSearch permission is denied for a directory listed in the new process image file's path prefix, or the new process image file denies execution permission.\n\nFurther rationale can be found at: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/66550/unix-execute-permission-can-be-easily-bypassed-is-it-superfluous-or-whats-the\n\nA: Make sure you are not confusing \"executing the shell script\" with \"run a shell script using sh\".\nThis will not be affected by file permissions on file.sh:\nsh file.sh\n\nYou are executing sh (which resolves to the program /bin/sh), which reads file.sh and executes it's code.\nFile permissions will have effect if you really execute the script itself :\n./file.sh\n\nNote that file permissions are not supported by non-Linux filesystems, like FAT. So even if you run chmod -x file.sh, the file will still have it's former permissions.\nExecute permission is enforced by the filesystem. But programs can \"execute\" the code too by reading the file contents, which bypasses filesystem permissions on \"execute\".\n\nA: Don't think of it in the way that. Can I execute this file? Think of it in the way that: Who can execute this file?\nIf the computer is yours and the file is yours I am sure you can execute it. You might want to look further into commands like chmod and chown, and file permissions. \nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: How to research graphics cards How would you go about choosing which graphics card to purchase.

I use two computers, a Linux one for coding and building and a Windows one which has the programming application to load the built program onto the hardware. Both computers have access to a network drive which I use to pass the files from Linux to Windows.\nMy problem is, that every time I build I have to copy the files from where the are created to the network drive. How can I make some sort of file in the network drive on Ubuntu that always mirrors the file which is built in the different location, like a pointer? Thanks!\n\nA: Many options come to mind but here are two.\n1) Work directly from files on the actual network share. (I personally would use NFS on the nix machine and tell the coding app on the Win7 machine to open / save all the working files on that mapped drive)\n2) Dropbox or equivalent tool/service which synchronises folders on multiple computers in real-time. Technology is built-in to use your LAN as well so you're not constantly uploading downloading over the WAN.\n\nA: Sounds like you can use a symlink to do this - basically, you'll create a local symlink of your network drive.  When the files are built, it will look like a local directory to the build program (whatever that might be), but that folder will really be a folder on your NFS drive.\nYou need to be aware that depending on your network speeds, this could slow down the build process however.  You might be better off doing what you're doing now - waiting for the build to complete, then copying the files up.\nIf it sounds like symlinking is the way to go, comment on this answer and I'll edit it with instructions (basically drag and drop while holding down the shift and control keys, but there's a ln -s <link name> <target directory> command you can use too.\n\nA: Do you use VCS for storing your code?

Then you can check the new user's home and you will clearly see what kind of directories are created so you will know what you need copy then.\nBy the way, it's a bit odd situation: you told that you used XFCE on that NFS mounted share and no gnome (?). Then gnome should create directories at the first time. Are you sure that you (as the user, I mean, including gnome) can write to the mounted NFS /home?

Synaptic does not. Like the command line tools, it needs to run as root.\nThe most simple way to allow a user access to it without having to type their password is by editing /etc/sudoers. This would allow you to set certain sudo commands to not require a password.\nusername  ALL=(ALL) ALL, NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/synaptic\n\nNabbed from here.\nYou might then have to edit the launcher from gksu synaptic to sudo synaptic. But you might not.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Ubuntu Software Centre and Synaptic Package Manager? I am transferring from 8.10 to 10.10. I was wondering what is the difference between Ubuntu Software Centre and Synaptic Package Manager in 10.10? For what kinds of things do I need to go which? \nThanks!\n\nA: Both of them are package managers. Software center is simple to use, but synaptic is more complicated and provides more options (more details about packages for example). Synaptic will be removed from Ubuntu soon (but still available to install) since software center can do the work (here).\n\nA: Syanptic is more powerful and was designed as a package manager. Software Center was designed as an \"app-store\" like program.\n\nA: In synaptic package manager you can select several packages and install at once.\nBut in Software Center you cannot do that. You have to select one and click on install and then only can select the next.\n", "Q: What happened to sched_mc_power_savings My laptop's battery performance is awful.

Recently VLC has been having issues displaying video in fullscreen mode. AFAIK, nothing has changed with the video card drivers and it's certainly the same version of VLC.  (/me shakes a fist at the repository maintainers)\nThis has worked without issue in the past.  In fact, I've had as many as 6 instances of VLC running, each playing a video.  One was always fullscreen on my second monitor, while the others were tiled on my primary monitor.  I was able to toggle any of the other 5 into fullscreen mode and the video displayed without issue.\nLately, I've been having trouble running 2 instances in fullscreen mode.  (Sometimes, even a single instance will not display the video in fullscreen.)  VLC will continue to play the video, but in fullscreen mode I see nothing but a black screen.  Sometimes, the video will display if I maximize the VLC window.  Other times, I have to settle for a smaller sized window.\nI don't know if this is pertinent, but sometimes changing the min/max state of a Firefox window (Minefield, specifically) seemed to allow the troublesome instance to display the video in fullscreen mode.  However, that did not prove to be a consistent workaround.  Sometimes, it seemed that closing a Firefox window did the trick, though that isn't consistently successful either.  (I futzed with Firefox, because with the crazy number of windows and tabs that I normally have open, it regularly hogs about 1 GB of RAM.)\nAnother bit of funkiness that comes to mind is the fact that my secondary monitor is considered the primary on boot-up.  I use xrandr to designate the real 1st monitor as primary after boot-up, as suggested by someone in a question I asked on the Unix & Linux SE site.\nSpecs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.10  w/ Gnome and Compiz  \n\n*8GB RAM  \n\n*AMD Phenom II 965 Black Edition  \n\n*Asus M4A79 Deluxe mobo  \n\n*XFX ATI Radeon HD 5750 w/ 1GB RAM  \n\n\nVLC is configured to use the hardware overlay for video (as per the default setting)\nDoes anyone have an idea what may cause this issue or how I may go about troubleshooting it? Right now I have 2 instances of VLC playing, each in fullscreen mode on a separate monitor. \n\nA: Two things you should know about VLC:\n1. If you have compiz activated you will have some issues with VLC showing the video from a movie. \n2. If you have multiple displays it will have some issues with VLC choosing which display to show the video in.\nSo for what i have read, you have both of this. From my experiences with similar cases i recommend to disable compiz and afterwards test the displays. To disable compiz just ALT+F2 and type metacity --replace or you can just go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance and select the Visual Effects Tab then select none.\nSecond, to test the display problem.\nFirst test if you can see the video on 1 display (without the other one connected).\nSecond test (with the video closed. Do not open it yet) with both monitors connected and in \"clone mode\". Run the video and see if it appears in both displays.\nThird and last, remove the \"clone mode\". Put one to the right or left and open 2 instances of VLc. move one of the instances to the left/right display and the other one leave it on the base display.\nthis is the way i do when i have black screen issues with vlc. This is because of some issues with compiz and with having multiple displays since VLC does not know to which to show the display.\nTest all this and let us know.\n\nA: In Tools > Preferences > Video > Output change the Default to X11, save and restart vlc.\n\nA: Given the number of good answers, if you are still having problems - I suggest filling a bug report with vlc and launchpad.

The rest of the X.org configuration options are in /usr/share/X11 like synaptics.\nNow to test out if you have Direct Rendering do this:\nglxinfo | grep -i \"Direct Rendering\" If it says YES then you can run several games. If it says NO then you might need more configuration. Also run glxgears to see how many FPS you have.

I've two interfaces: eth0 and wlan0 on a notebook.\nPossible use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*eth0 grants me Internet access, and wlan0 is currently connected to a router which does not have Internet-connectivity. For development purposes, I need to connect to the wlan0 by default, but use eth0 for surfing\n\n*eth0 and wlan0 are both connected to the Internet. For a torrent application, eth0 should be used for speed, but for portability of the notebook, SSH should have a connection over wlan0\n\n*eth0 is a wire connection, wlan0 is a wireless one. Sensible data should be transferred over eth0, but other traffic can go over wlan0 as well.\n\n\nIs there a way to force applications (like nc.traditional or firefox) to use a certain network interface? A wrapper like example-wrapper eth0 program is fine too if such program exist. It would be nice if it could configured within Firefox (in runtime). I'd like to avoid IPTables solutions if possible.\n\nA: What you are looking for is a LS_PRELOAD shim, see Daniel Lange's blog entry for a detailed explanation and example code.\n\nA: You can use a more complex approach of connections marking and route policy.\nIt will work fine if you have a user that runs one software and anther.\nThis way you can mark the connections of one user and use specific routing table for it while all the others will use the default one.\nThe basic document to understand it all is at: http://www.lartc.org/lartc.html\nAlso an example for two connections you can see here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58635/iptables-set-mark-route-diferent-ports-through-different-interfaces \nYou can use the \"owner\" iptables module which will mark the connections to allow routing policy.\n\nA: Here is a sample solution. It uses SOCKS server, setup on current machine to route coneections. Each application should be configured to use each server.\n\nA: You can also use a VMware workstation machine to share different network interfaces which I do a lot to download from one interface and leave the other for my Netflix.\nYou do need to setup both ethX and wlanX on VMware but once you have it configured you're ready to download or browse. \nIt's pretty smooth.

I'm sshing into my friends machine and I'm wondering how would i launch a GNOME session over SSH? I need to open a web browser on his machine to view something which can only be done from his hostname. What's the easiest way to achieve this via SSH?\n\nA: Another method is to use a local browser and use SSH as a proxy\nssh -D 3128 user@hostname \n\nAnd temporary configure your browser to use localhost:3128 as a socks v5 proxy. \nSince only the data and not the full rendering needs to go through the line this will also be much quicker. \nIf you need to do this more often, look for the foxyproxy extension that allows automatic switching based on rules. \n\nA: try ssh -X user@hostname. When you then get the prompt you can just type in firefox or any X application on the remote machine and pipe the visual output to your machine.\n\nA: Though I have not done it myself. You can basically run graphical apps through client by tunneling X over ssh. \nyou need to enable X11Forwarding which resides in your ssh config on server machine.

I would like to deactivate the amplification feature on my sound volume slider. Using any amplification makes the sound really bad with clipping sounds taking over.\nIt's really annoying to have to worry about where the amplification starts/stops when adjusting the slider from my keyboard or through the Gnome panel (sound thingy). I have to open the \"Sound preferences\"  after each time adjusting the volume and ensure that the level is set to 100% unamplified.\nSo can I do this someway easy in Ubuntu 10.10?\n\nA: Actually, you CAN slide all the way up: when using the indicator applet icon, the max slider IS 100% unamplified\nTo raise it ABOVE 100% (ie, to use amplified levels), you must go Sound Preferences.\nSo, when using the applet icont, go ahead and dont worry, it wont be amplified.\nYou can check this yourself: open the Sound Preferences window, and leave it open, visible on the desktop\nNow access the indicator apllet icon, and slide up and down the volume level. Compare them (both will slide at the same time), and you will see that, using the applet, you can only go as far as 100% unamplified.\nHope that helps!\n(i also had the same concern when i started using Ubuntu.. its a huge relief when you realize you dont have to open Sound Preferences anymore to \"adjust\"  it ;)\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04, whether the Sound Settings control panel volume slider allows setting the volume above 100% is controlled by the following dconf key. Run the following command to disallow setting the volume above 100%. Change takes effect immediately.\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.sound allow-amplified-volume false\n\n\nA: I always install the pulse audio volume control its official name is \"pavucontrol\", available in the software centre. With Music player playing adjust the playback volume. I find 80% improves the sound as it appears most players, always set their outputs at 100% and this distorts on my laptop.\nNote this is independent of your volume control.\n\nA: PulseAudio sets 100% to what the driver of your sound card reports as \"100%, unamplified\".  If the driver reports incorrect values to PulseAudio, there is no way for PulseAudio to know there is something wrong, and you will get distorted sound when playing loud sounds at 100% (or when the error is in the other direction, you get sound that is not loud enough).\nYou will have to report a bug against the driver for your sound card, which you can do by executing ubuntu-bug audio, answering the questions, and explaining in your bug report on Launchpad what your problem is.  Do not just add your comments to another bug of somebody with the same or a similar problem but report your own bug; there are several driver/hardware combinations with this issue and each might need a different patch/workaround in the driver, and the 'ubuntu-bug' command attaches all necessary hardware-information to the bug report.\n\nA: Sound preferences (gnome-volume-control) only shows the master PulseAudio volume slider. What you are looking for are in the alsa mixer controls. I recommend that you install the package gnome-alsamixer \nsudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer\n\nand then start the application by the same name. This should allow you to tweak your sound card setting including disabling amplification.\n\nA: If you have a nice hifi system (like I do), then your best option is to get rid of pulseaudio completely and use hardware volume control from alsa directly.\nIt makes a BIG difference.\njust apt-get remove pulseaudio\nYou will lose a bit of flexibility (like playing lots of sounds simultaneously), but it will really make for much better sound experience.\n", "Q: Why does the Ubuntu One website report my phone as \"My Phone: Other/Unspecified\"? I have a Samsung Galaxy 5, but the Ubuntu One phone page reports it as \"Other/Unspecified\"? How do I add my phone's information?\n\nA: That phone information page is merely to give you the right instructions for enabling contact sync on your phone, and the database (which we get from funambol) is by no means complete. Given that you're seeing that page for the first time with your phone already there, it means that you've successfully set up your phone without going via the phone setup webpage (yay for us! the installer works), so you don't need the instructions, so you should be fine.\n", "Q: Is there a way to remove maximized window controls/title from top panel in Unity Cramming window controls and window title into the top panel, doesn't really appeal to me, since it looks like it's a permanent fixture, I'm wondering if there is a way to disable this behavior.\n\nA: I'm afraid it's not really possible.\n\nA: While using Unity, I'm afraid it is not possible at the moment, at least not via any configuration options. Uninstalling some packages might work, but could result in numerous problems.\nIf you are fond ot the old style Ubuntu with Gnome-panel 2, you could always opt to boot into Ubuntu Classic.\n\nA: I suppose you could uninstall indicator-appmenu but I've not tried that and removing it is not really a supported configuration in 11.04.\n\nA: If you add window decoration in Compiz you can get your old window behavior back (min/max/close at the top right of the window).

So say I have a dir listing like this:\n~/projects/\n~/projects/apples/\n~/projects/apples-and-pears/\n~/projects/cabbage/\n\nj a will match both apples* dirs but as apples-and-pears is the later, it will cd into that last, and that's where you'll end up (the flaw in this function). j c will put you in ~/projects/cabbage/.\nBung that into a terminal to test it and when you're happy, just plonk it on the end of ~/.bashrc.\nEdit: I've also been playing around making a find variant but it's not as good (slower and less accurate). Feel free to hack around with it though.\nfunction j() { cd $(find ~/projects -maxdepth 1 -type d -name \"$@*\"); }\n\n\nA: Usually you can use popd, pushd and dirs to jump between some folders.

I am not sure if it's possible with VirtualBox or similar software, as far as I remember I've read somewhere that it's possible in theory though you will have problems: \"inside\" the virtual machine, win7 will see different hardware \"environment' than it would, if it runs on the \"bare iron\".

Is there a way to make Chrome/Chromium's notifications use notify-osd instead of the ugly boxes it uses by default?\n\nA: Since NPAPI is gone, pretty much every solution is dead. It looks like there's currently only one solution, and it isn't great.\nLibnotify Notifications in Chrome\nIt is rated very low, but that's most likely because it is still incomplete. It also requires a piece of software to run on the machine itself, so it's not the most easy installation.\nHowever, if you can run scripts and are willing to take security risks, this may work great for you, as long as you don't expect it to work with everything (the author says Gmail is currently in the works).\nSadly, it seems that Google's decision to kill NPAPI in Chromium has also killed this convenience measure.\nI will continue to research, but at the moment, this is the only solution I can find that isn't over a year old.\n\nA: Yeah: Chromify-OSD.\n\nThis can be installed from the Google Chrome Web Store.\nTo install it, just go to the webstore and click the \"Add to Chrome\" button - it'll do the rest.\nTo use it, you'll probably need to restart Chrome, at that point it should be working.\nAll bugs should be reported to the launchpad.net project page - for more on reporting bugs, take a look at this question: How do I report a bug?\n\nA: Once you have installed it in Chrome, Click on the Wrench Icon, then select the Prefences Menu, then Extensions and you should see:\n\nThe Chromify-OSD extension Icon and that it is enabled.

When i use the cp or move command in a terminal window,\ni'm currently with bash in a certain folder like this.\nNES@server:~/Desktop/dir1$\n\nAnd now i wanna copy a file from here ~/anotherdir/dir2 into the current\nchosen folder in bash (dir1) i would use the command\ncp ~/anotherdir/dir2/file ~/Desktop/dir1\n\ndoes a shortcut string exist to refer to the current chosen directory?\nSo that in this example i don't have to provide the full path to the target dir, but\nthe command knows it should use the current chosen directory in bash?\ni.e. as ~ stands for the home directory?\n\nA: You can use $(pwd), it will resolve to the output from the pwd command.\nExample:\necho $(pwd)\n\n\nA: Your current directory is . .  So, cp /foo/fam/foo . copies the file to your current directory.\nThe analogous construction for \"one directory up,\" or the parent directory of your current working directory, is two dots, i.e., .. . (Thanks @djeikyb .)  \nSo, from /usr/house/firstfloor/basement , cd .. takes you one level up to /usr/house/firstfloor.   \nIn the same example (starting from /usr/house/firstfloor/basement, the command cd ../.. would take you to /usr/house . \nYou can also use $PWD with echo to get your current directory: \necho $PWD\n\nIncidentally, $OLDPWD will give you your previous directory.  (Which in bash you can also reach by typing cd - .)\n\nA: ./ represents the current directory. So you can use command cp ~/anotherdir/dir2/file ./ This will copy the file \"file\" into currect working directory.\n\nA: To use the current directory as the destination directory use a single dot '.'\nLong Answer\nUsing your example you would type: cp ~/anotherdir/dir2/file .\nTo see the dot ., .. and ../../ directory names in action, copy and paste the following commands into your Terminal:\nmkdir a && mkdir a/b && mkdir a/b/c && mkdir a/b/c2\ncd a/b/c\ncp /etc/default/grub .\ncp /etc/default/grub ..\ncp /etc/default/grub ../c2\ncd ../../\ntree\n\nThe output from tree command appears like this:\n.\n└── b\n    ├── c\n    │   └── grub\n    ├── c2\n    │   └── grub\n    └── grub\n\n3 directories, 3 files\n\nThe . at the top of tree output represents the new current directory a  which is the grandparent of a/b/c which we navigated to using the cd ../../ command. Underneath a we see the sub-directories a/b, a/b/c and a/b/c2\nLine by line analysis\nFirst we created 4 directories on one line by using && to join multiple lines together.\nThen we changed to the directory a/b/c, which is the current directory for the following copy commands:\n\n*\n\n*In the first copy command (cp) we set the destination to our\ncurrent directory (c) with ..\n\n*In the second copy command we set the destination to the parent\ndirectory (b) with ...\n\n*In the third copy command we set the destination to the sibling\ndirectory (c2) with ../c2\nThen, as stated earlier, we changed the current directory to a and ran the tree command to display all directories and files under a.\nCleanup\nAfter we are done, we remove the three directories and files with:\ncd ~/\nrm -r tree\n\n\nA: The environment variable for the current directory is $PWD\necho $PWD\n\n\nA: You can use the dot (.), the ~+ tilde expansion, the pwd command or the $PWD variable to represent the current working directory (CWD). All these commands can do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv file_old_dir .\n\n*mv file_old_dir ~+\n\n*mv file_old_dir $(pwd)\n\n*mv file_old_dir $PWD\n\nA: Yes (as others noted), current directory is \".\", that's why you can start programs/script from the current directory with ./script (just script won't work unless . is not the part of PATH, which is not recommended though). Using $PWD or $(pwd) is a bit overkill, even if others mentioned that, using a single dot character is shorter, for sure :) \"..\" is the parent directory, for sure \"/\" is the root. Also nice to mention that \"cd -\" will put you in the previous directory where you were before you changed cwd (current working directory). It can be also useful in the daily work. A single \"cd\" command without any other in the command line will put you into \"~\" (your home).\n\nA: cp ~/anotherdir/dir2/file `pwd`\n\nThe back ticks mean to run the command that is between them and replace it all by the resulting output, in this case the working directory (\"pwd\" means \"print working directory\").\nOf course, I prefer the \".\" version. Added this one only for completeness.\n", "Q: viewing/editing .vsd files in ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I open Visio files? \n\nCan anyone suggest a program which can open MS Visio .vsd files for editing in Ubuntu?\n\nA: As far as I know (and I've researched this for somebody else before), there are no desktop apps that can open Visio VSDs on Linux. Even Visio under Wine seems to struggle.\nHowever, there is Zamzar. It's a webservice that converts lots of documents. You just have to give them the file, tell them what you want in return and give them an email address.

Run convmv -f cp850 -t utf-8 * without quotes in the folder with the broken files and have a try.\n(You need convmv package installed)\n\nA: If you just want to get rid of some characters, you could try this:\nrename \"s/[^A-Za-z0-9-_]/_/g\"\n\nThat would replace every character that is not just char, number or dash with an underscore. Run with the -n option to see what is happening in a dry-run.\n\nA: I guess that modern OSes often chooses UTF-8 for encoding file names. In this sense it's not a problem to have non-US characters in the file names. What you have experienced is probably the result of a file name which was created with non-UTF-8 encoding. It's quite hard to tell what you can do with that, it's also depends what you'd like. If you need the correct file name (for example \"Porträt.pdf\") you need to know the encoding of the original file name first, then you can convert it/them.

You could just redirect the stderr parts to /dev/null like this:\nssh user@server-name \"df -hP | egrep '(/home|/cors)' 2>/dev/null\"\n\nor \nssh user@server-name \"df -hP 2>/dev/null | egrep '(/home|/cors)'\"\n\nDepending on what's making the error.\n\nA: I guess you have some tput command in your bash profile or bashrc, etc, on the machine you have ssh'd to. Check files .bashrc .bash_profile in your home (on the remote machine) or files in the /etc like the one which was mentioned in your question too. It's hard to tell what can cause this, since you may modified those files, and it can cause the problem?\nIt's also depend if it's a problem you want to eliminate, or you just want it make non-noticable: then it can be OK to redirect stderr into /dev/null for example (edited: as other answer is about this, as far as I can see now).\n", "Q: Proper policy for user setup I am still fairly new to linux hosting and am currently working on some policies for our production ubuntu servers.  The servers are public facing webservers with ssh access from the public network and database servers with ssh access from the internal private network.  We are a small hosting company so in the past with windows servers we used one user account and one password that each of us used internally.  Anyone outside of the company who needed to access the server for FTP or anything else had their own user account.  Is that okay to do in the linux world, or would most people recommend using individual accounts for each person who needs to access the server?\n\nA: It's mater of taste, however from security reasons, I think it's better to have more users. Why? Because even \"internal workers\" of your company may have different works so they need different privileges. It's always better to give only the minimal rights for a given function/program/user/etc which is just enough. If you have only one user for more people, you may need to give more rights, so many people using that single user will have more rights than they need. It can be an issue if that account is cracked, or even if a worker make a mistake like removing files, etc, many examples can be mentioned. Also the worker itself can be an enemy (it's quite usual think in the IT ground ...) so it's better to separate people/their rights etc. I guess it's not an Ubuntu specific topic, it's about all OSes. That's also a reason that Ubuntu - unlike many other Linux and/or UNIX distributions - don't have root user by default (cannot be logged in, since no valid password): it's quite dangerous to log in as root, since you (or anybody who managed to log in ...) have \"unlimited\" access.

I just ask this, since it's a bit unfortunate: like bash creates .bash_history, some commands can have there config files written into the home, so you have to fight with those as well, whenever you use some commands/utils of these kind. \n", "Q: Is there a simple mail server I can install? I have a desktop install of ubuntu, not server. But I am running a localhost LAMP stack for development. Is there a simple mail server I can install so that PHP's sendmail works? \nIdeally it will have few options and minimal configuration, and preferably a GUI rather than CL interface.\nEDIT to add - do I use the Local Only configuration to test php mail()?\n\n\nA: Just postfix is needed.\nFor setup, just use the defaults. Internet site. When you get to it, there's a section for setting which computers are allowed to relay mail through the server. The default is 127.0.0.1 (worded slightly more verbosely) and this is good. This means even if another computer can connect to postfix, postfix wont allow it to send mail anwhere but to the destinations postfix accepts as \"local\" domains.\nBut good network security on top won't hurt. A router blocking incoming connections and/or a firewall (see ufw) will stop anybody else contacting postfix.\nIf you need to reconfigure, just run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\n\nA: The easiest one I've ever installed is postfix with dovecot.  There is a dovecot-postfix package, but it also looks like the Ubuntu server team has packaged this as mail-stack-delivery :\nDescription: mail server delivery agent stack provided by Ubuntu server team\n Ubuntu's mail stack provides fully operational delivery with\n safe defaults and additional options. Out of the box it supports IMAP,\n POP3 and SMTP services with SASL authentication and Maildir as default\n storage engine.\n\nLooking in the Software Center, I see that dovecot-postfix is present as a meta-pacakge (but I don't know if it will be called that a release or two from now).  But that is what I'd recommend -- it's straightforward and secure. \nFrom the command line on my 10.10 desktop, I installed this via apt-get :  \nsudo apt-get install dovecot-postfix\nGive it a shot if you like, and if you have questions, just start a new post.\n\nHere's a oldish (2009) Ubuntu Server Blog post that gives some of the details on the dovecot-postfix configuration.   \nI'm trying to find out more information on the current status of Ubuntu-centric mailserver projects.  Right now I'm not finding much more than a May 2010 wiki post about making anti-spam/virus integration easier. \n\nA: If you only want to debug locally, you can follow this approach presented at stackoverflow. Single line in php.ini, no additional packages. Writes your outgoing mail to a file which can be opened with mail client in case you want to debug html mail.\nsendmail_path = 'tee /tmp/mylocal.mail > /dev/null'\n\n\nA: Well, GUI or CL interface for a mail server is not as important question, since you don't need UI for a mail server anyway, only at for initial configuration (ok, and maybe at times when there are configuration changes like relayhost, etc, but it's quite rare situation with an already-working server). So I don't think it's an important aspect. I can suggest using of postfix, it's enough to just install (apt-get install postfix) and the most basic configuration settings are asked on install time. Then it will work with PHP's mail(), etc, no need for further configuration or heavy/daily usage of any UI (let is GUI or CLI, though I don't know about GUI for postfix configuration, maybe some general system config solution like webmin will work for this purpose anyway). Just be careful, not to produce an open relay system :)\n\nA: You do not need a mail server to send email, only to receive email. For sending email (using sendmail) select the Internet with smarthost option.\n\nA: MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.\nhttps://mailcatcher.me/\n", "Q: What are ways for file transfer between computers I just learned there are several ways to transfer files between Windows on two computers from here. I was wondering \n\n\n*\n\n*what are the possible ways to\ntransfer files between Ubuntus on\ntwo computers? And between a Ubuntu\n8.10 computer and a Windows-7 computer, or between a Ubuntu 10.10\nand a Windows-xp?\n\n*Which way requires minimum extra\nhardwares and which way can achieve\nthe highest transfer speed?\n\n\nThanks and regards!\nPS: I have a rounter.\n\nA: Between Linux/UNIX boxes, ssh/scp is quite good solution, it also provide you an encrypted file transfer. Note, that with \"sshfs\" (there is an ubuntu package called this, you can install it) you can even \"mount\" (with FUSE, but it's not important to know) the remote directory, and you can read/write then, as it was a local filesystem, you don't need to copy files \"manually\" each time. I even use the machine in the other part of the country, with sshfs to play videos, so I don't need to \"download\" them first (well, if the network bandwidth is enough for this). For windows, you can have the usual \"shares\" and you can mount as CIFS.\n\nA: The ways to transfer files between Linuses are clearly using sshfs sftp:// urls. Not much more to say on that, others did it well. For the file transfer between Windows and Linux, there are a couple of ways. The first is to use sftp, once it is installed on your server. You will likely have to install the package openssh-server. Search for this using Synaptics. \nThen, under Windows, you can use filezilla to read and write files from your Linux server. It is strongly recommended that the actions be initiated from the Windows box. Installing and sharing files FROM Windows is not very stable, in my opinion. FileZilla will use sftp to transfer files. \nThe other way is to install samba and actually map a drive from Windows to it. You need to install the required samba packages on your server. You then also need to define a path under Linux and a sharename. Search for samba and Windows on the ubuntu web site. There are many web pages about this. Once the samba share is created, you can then map a drive to this share or use the \"network neighborhood\" to access them. One of the settings in the samba config file is the name of the workgroup. This name must match the actual name of the workgroup of your Windows machine. \nUnless this is a connection that will be used on an ongoing basis, I strongly recommend that you then disable the NFS connection once you are done. \n\nA: My favourite is through ssh. You can use the fish:// handler to achieve file management and sharing through via ssh both in dolphin (in KDE) or nautilus (in GNOME). Also you'd be able to add a \"shortcut\" to shared folders in the Ubuntu menu, clicking on \"Resource\" and then \"Connect to server\", where you can specify the other machine's login data and so.\nThere's no need for extra hardware apart from a router (which you already have). The only service needed is a running ssh server, which most distributions ship by default.\n", "Q: Tomboy error while tring to sync with Ubuntu one; Can anyone help?

Under Windows one of my favorite software packages was cFosSpeed, a traffic shaping tool. It yields major performance improvements when, for example, having a video conversation while downloading a torrent in the background.\nIs there an alternative for this under Ubuntu?\n\nA: The Linux kernel itself has these capabilities, but for sure, it's not trivial to set up for people not familiar with these in-deep stuffs (using the command line oriented \"tc\" command which can manipulate the traffic control capabilities of the Linux kernel). I am not sure that you asks about an easy-to-use GUI, or you need only the theory. Maybe this helps:\nhttp://lartc.org/wondershaper/\nIt has at least a script, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel too much :)\n\nA: Wondershaper is powerful but has a bunch of pre-reading which it says is required in order to us it.\nFor somethig simpler, consider FireQOS:\n\nFireQOS is a program which sets up traffic shaping from an easy-to-understand and flexible configuration file.\nFireQOS is a traffic shaping helper. It has a very simple shell scripting language to express traffic shaping. You run FireQOS to setup the kernel commands. You can also run it to get status information or dump the traffic of a class. FireQOS is not a daemon and does not need to run always to apply traffic shaping.\n\nThere's also a tutorial for new users.\n", "Q: Qt-sdk Setup causes Segmentation Fault Immediately after I start the ./qt-sdk-linux-x86-opensource-2010.05.1.bin setup and press submit, I get a \"Segmentation fault\" in the Terminal.

You can install the Qt development libraries (libqt4-dev, etc.) and programs (e.g. Qt creator) from within the Ubuntu repositories.  If you're trying to compile your own version specific Qt program available in Ubuntu, you can run sudo apt-get build-dep [ubuntu package name] in order to get the libraries that program depends upon.\n", "Q: Wifi won't enter working net after hard reboot I rebooted the hard way after my system jammed again because FF eats all the ram.

I was checking out different text editors and tried to install VIM through Ubuntu Software Centre. Everything went fine and I got it installed, but I couldn't find the launcher (not sure if that is the right term). Any reason why this might be the case?\n\nA: vim is a command line text editor, to use it you launch a terminal and type vim.\nIf you want a graphical vim you can install vim-gnome\nsudo apt-get install vim-gnome\n\n\nA: Vim is a text based editor (to be used in a terminal), not a GUI program.

VIM is not so easy to operate especially for beginners, it has separated \"command\" and \"input\" mode, etc etc. The advantage: you can find at least VI (if not vim) in almost all UNIX'es or even other systems, that's why it's favorite of many people ... \n", "Q: Disable Tomboy System Tray First of all, I don't use indicator applet, but I suppose that the icon/process managing Tomboy is the same for both indicator applet and system tray.\nI want only notificaitons in my system tray (apps have a different dwelling!).

I read recently that someone demonstrated a security attack on a PC via the use of automount and a USB stick.\nHow vulnerable am I to this attack and what steps are developers doing to be proactive against this sort of thing?\n\nA: You're not vulnerable to the specific attack, but the approach is very interesting. The vulnerabilities used are already fixed.\nI've been chatting with Jon Larimer since I heard about his presentation at Shmoo. The defeat of ASLR takes\nquite a while (Larimer is brute-forcing it on an NX-emu 32bit system\n-- a relatively easy target -- and for the demo he disabled ASLR to show\nit more quickly), and at the time hadn't found a workable way to bypass\nAppArmor (which he also turned off for the demo), so this speaks pretty\nwell to the proactive defenses in Ubuntu.

Is it possible to execute an action (a command or a Bash Script) by double clicking on the Desktop?\nI want to emulate the function that Fences does in Windows systems: By double clicking the desktop, you show/hide the icons/folders you have in the Desktop.\nThe script is not the problem, what I want to know is how to execute it when double clicking on an unused area of my desktop.\n\nA: I'm guessing you mean by clicking on the desktop itself, rather than an Icon on the desktop (the latter can be done just by having the script in your desktop folder...)\nIf you're willing to compromise a little, using CCSM\napt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThe 'commands' plugin allows you to bind commands (like running your script) to events. Under the 'Button Bindings' tab you can assign your command to when you Click while your mouse is on one of the edges. I appreciate this isn't the complete solution, but as you can select all of the edges, it'll almost do what you want.\nHope that gets you some of the way.\n\nA: This is completely possible.  If you place any program (script or binary) on your Desktop and ensure that it has execute permission, it will be executed by double-click by the vast majority of desktop rendering software (very definitely thunar and nautilus, but anything else that follows the same specifications).  Note that some desktop handlers may ask for confirmation that you wish to run, rather than view, the program, depending on the implementation of the program (this is in part to workaround a historical issue that files from FAT tend to all be marked executable, even when one doesn't want to execute them).\nIf you prefer a pretty icon, create a .desktop file on your desktop referencing the program you wish to run.  If this is granted execute permission, any compliant desktop rendering program will launch the program as described in the .desktop file, and should do so without asking for confirmation in any way.\nThe specification for creation of .desktop files is http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ , or you might start with something already created under /usr/share/applications/ .  You can check to make sure your .desktop file is correctly written with the 'desktop-file-validate' program from desktop-file-utils.\n\nA: As far as the icon organising feature of Fences: I haven't found anything yet for GNOME, but KDE.4 has a desktop widget called FolderView that I think does close to what you want.

And I uninstalled them all: they do much more than I need, so I kept the simplest (still looking for a text-based one! :D). But, for people who needs a lot more, they fill their needs. :)\n\nA: There's no software in Linux like the current Winamp. If you want something almost similar, try Audacious, BUT the skined interface ONLY supports winamp 2.x skins.

If the buttons work, you can restart you laptop and boot ubuntu. It should work then, it did for me.\nAlthough it is just a workaround, I hope it helps.\n\nA: Most likely it was because there was a certain driver in use due to Windows/Vista being installed. During your LiveCD usage it's using the currently loaded drives from the main installation I.E. Windows and it uses those. When you install well, that all goes away. Most likely you'll need some proprietary driver or driver(s) if they even exist which I'm sure they do. \n", "Q: Assigning keyboard shortcuts to multi-monitor configurations Using Ubuntu 10.10.

If the problem is about the X server itself, you can check that by launching X with just command \"X\" (capital letter). It won't start any login manager, desktop environment or so, but if the gray/checked background appears, X server works at least. If not, you can see the log, also check the log file I've mentioned.\nBtw haven't you used some closed source graphics driver? Like nvidia's or ATI's. It's installable via restricted driver manager. If you use something like that, I can imagine that you update the kernel, but not the driver, so now you are with a kernel without the driver X is configured for.If it's the situation, try to boot the previous kernel.\nAlso please note that Ubuntu 9.10 will have end of support soon, maybe it's a good idea to upgrade ...\n\nA: try to type xfix as sudo.

But CouchDB does not encrypt the replication as far as I know.\nIs it possible to use Python to get authentication with OAuth an start a replication via  https://couchdb.one.ubuntu.com between CouchDB and the UbuntuOne Server?\n\nA: Yes. Desktopcouch does replication between a CouchDB (on your desktop) and https://couchdb.one.ubuntu.com, and that will work from any CouchDB; the CouchDB that desktopcouch runs is not something special.\nTo start a replication between a CouchDB of your choice and Ubuntu One, use the Couch replication API:\nPOST /_replicate HTTP/1.1\n{\n  \"source\":\"example-database\",\n  \"target\":{\n    \"url\": \"https://couchdb.one.ubuntu.com/u%2Fabc%2Fdef%2F123456%2Fexample-database\",\n    \"auth\": {\n      \"oauth\": {\n        \"consumer_key\": \"xxx\",\n        \"consumer_secret\": \"xxx\",\n        \"token\": \"xxx\",\n        \"token_secret\": \"xxx\"\n      }\n    }\n  } \n}\n\nYou can find example code which actually kicks off this replication from Python in couchdb_io.py in the desktopcouch tree.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use more than two monitors?

How can I switch between fglrx and ati (open source) drivers without uninstalling fglrx?\nThe thing is I'm using FGLRX on a daily basis, because it's better for movies--OS driver displays annoying horizontal line while playing movies. FGLRX also does this, but it's less visible. That's only disadvantage of OS driver.\nWhen I want to plug in external monitor with different resolution than my laptop's LCD I have to use open source driver, because FGLRX can't display two different resolutions at the same time.\nI can uninstall FGLRX, but it's rather inconvenient to do this all the time. I've noticed that when I'm using FGLRX there is xorg.conf file and when I uninstall it, then the file is missing.\nSo my question is how to switch between them? It'll be perfect if I could do this without restarting my computer either.\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10, laptop/netbook MSI U250.\n\nA: In theory it's possible: first, you should modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf, I think you need to modify things in the \"Device\" section (well, Xorg nowdays works fine without xorg.conf, as you noted too, so the other solution is rename xorg.conf so X won't use it). \nBut it's only the half part of the story, the other part is the kernel driver. I would \"blacklist\" fglrx as a kernel module, so it won't be load, when you don't need it: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \nI don't have a setup for ATI card in this way, but I have similar for nvidia, to switch between nvidia's binary driver and nouveau (open source driver for nvidia cards).\n\nA: Unforunately you cannot switch between open and closed source graphic drivers as they need to install kernel modules.\nIf you need different settings you may consider a dual boot setup.\n\nA: There is a really easy solution that should work with ATI :\nYou need to backup your /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nAfter that, if you delete xorg.conf and restart you'll start on open source drivers, and if you restore it and restart you'll start on ATI Catalyst drivers.\nThe risk is minimal here but when dealing with xorg.conf make sure you know how to restore it in command line in case Xorg don't start\n", "Q: Hamachi² configuration file...

I recently installed hamachi² and haguichi on my 10.10 machine.\nIt works, but it loses its connection every few minutes and I have to reconnect. \nI looked into this, and apparently I need to set the KeepAlive in the configuration file to 100. This shouldn't be a hard task, so I looked for the hamachi directory.\nI checked the obvious place: /home/username/.hamachi ... but this directory doesn't exist. (Yes, I did enable hidden files.)\nAfter doing a file search for hamachi, it returned nothing either. I'm in the dark here, what am I missing?\n\nA: You can also use Haguichi, this is a GUI for Hamachi.\nSee:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/install-hamachi2-and-haguichi-gui-for.html\nI have seen the .DEB file, it creates files in \n-/opt\n-/etc\n-/usr\nTake a look @ /opt/logmein-hamachi/bin\n", "Q: Why Gnome desktop services work simultaneously with Unity desktop?   After I log into unity-2d i see gnome panel and some other services working along side with unity services and I cannot get rid of these services.\nBesides, unity panel gets locked sometimes and i have to logout and login.

I run into wireless router and networking issues very often. I'd like to finally just read a book on how to trouble and diagnose problems, using tools like ifconfig, editing files like /etc/network/interfaces, and whatever. Any recommendations?\n\nA: Also you may want to look at Amazon.com for books on the subject. Many times there are used books at discount price that will give you want you need. \nI found a \"Linux Network Administration\" that normally lists for ~35USD for 12!\nHope this helps.\nRandy3011\n", "Q: How do I change the \"Default\" password here's my problem. When I log in I'm beeing asked for a password connecting to the internet which is strange because I'm the only user and the admin. I have auto log in and it never asks for passwords, (except when i do administrative tasks.)\nI have looked in the menu (System --> preferences, but i can't find any topic that say's passwords or similar. the only place where I have found a way to change my password is my user ((System --> preferences --> user and groups).\nI did try to take screenshots but nothing happened, which also is strange.\nI'm running ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop on my Asus 1201n (12\").\n\nA: \nChrome asks for the password when your account is set for autologin.\nDoing this makes it so that the keyring doesn't load when you\nreset/reboot your system.\nChrome is asking for the password to the keyring so it can access\nstored information in the keyring. You can view the keyring on your\nsystem by running the command seahorse from a terminal window. You can\nalso just bypass the asking by closing the window and still get to\nyour sites without a problem. Some of the security may not load\nproperly.\nHowever, you can use the following command from a terminal window to\nbypass the keyring asking:\ngoogle-chrome-stable --password-store=basic\n\nHope this helps!\n\nCopied entirely from @Terrance's answer here\n\nA: It's also possible that since your using auto-login, you might be hitting another problem - sometimes network manager doesn't seem to save the WEP/WPA key properly.  You can usually get round this by opening the connection and changing it \"available to all users\".\nSo, right click on network manager, choose \"Edit Connections\".  Find your connection, and choose \"Properties\", then tick the \"Available to all users\" box at the bottom.\n\n\nA: Sounds like your keychain is out of sync with your password.  Go to System/Preferences/Password and Encryption keys, then choose the \"login\" chain.\n\nThe only way that I know works is to set this to a blank password - you will be prompted on whether you are willing to trust this \"unsafe storage\" method, since your keyring will unlock automatically on login.\nI think you can also match the password on the login keychain to match that of your login password.  But a) I haven't tested that and b) you have to remember to change your keychain password whenever you change your login password.\nAs the only person on my laptop, configured with encrypted home, I'm happy with unsafe storage, but your mileage may vary.\n\nA: In order to change the root password, open a terminal\nsudo passwd\n\nWhen asked, provide your user password in order to perform sudo tasks, then enter the \"new UNIX password\" twice.\nNow the root user has a new password.\nYou will see something like this:\ngeppettvs@HANNAH:~$ sudo passwd\n[sudo] password for geppettvs: \nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\ngeppettvs@HANNAH:~$\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: NetworkManager connection shortcut I proposed to implement this feature in http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/27164/, but it was marked as already implemented. Could someone shed light on how i can do it? I would like a shortcut to a specific connection (vpn or broadband) on my panel (one click connect).\n\nA: You should be able to create shortcuts that call nmcli to bring up connections:\nnmcli con up id \"name of your connection\"\nHere's the result when I run this in a terminal on my system:\n% nmcli con up id \"PPTP VPN Testing\"\nActive connection state: activating\nActive connection path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/2\nstate: VPN connecting (3)\nstate: VPN connecting (getting IP configuration) (4)\nConnection activated\n\n\nA: NetworkManager has D-Bus interface, which you can use in other programs or scripts.\nFor example, I managed to connect one of my network-manager's VPN connections using this command:\n qdbus --system \\\n   org.freedesktop.NetworkManager \\\n   /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager \\\n   org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.ActivateConnection \\ #-- this is a method\n   org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings \\ #-- arg 1\n   /org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/4 \\ #-- arg 2\n   /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Devices/1 \\ #-- arg 3\n   / #-- dumb arg 4 (needed for wifi only)\n\nYou can browse your D-Bus infrastructure with qdbusviewer tool from the qt4-dev-tools package. CLI-only qdbus is from libqt4-dbus.\nNetworkManager's D-Bus API is documented here.\nWhen you find your needed parameters (connection number, device number, etc), you could save the lines as a shell script and create a launcher on the panel to quickly access it.\nPersonally I don't bother and just do the two additinal clicks. After all, I'm not connecting to VPN too often to suffer from them.\n\nA: I use cnetworkmanager with this python script for convenience. The script first starts LAN connection, then opens VPN.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef getConnectionState():\n  \"\"\"Returns 'CONNECTED' or 'DISCONNECTED'\n  \"\"\"\n  p = subprocess.Popen(\"cnetworkmanager --state\", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n  stdout = p.communicate()\n  result = stdout[0].split('\\n')[0]\n  return result\n\ndef isConnected():\n  return getConnectionState() == 'CONNECTED'\n\ndef connectEthernet(name='myethernet'):\n  p = subprocess.Popen(\"cnetworkmanager --activate-connection=user,%s,,\" % name, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n\ndef connectVPN(name='myvpn'):\n  p = subprocess.Popen(\"cnetworkmanager --activate-connection=user,%s,eth0,\" % name, shell=True)\n\ndef timeout():\n  while True:\n    time.sleep(0.2)\n    if isConnected():\n      break\n\nconnectEthernet()\ntimeout()\nconnectVPN(sys.argv[1])\n\n", "Q: Adding a indicator / panel in unity panel In GNOME panel we could add a notification indicator by doing \"Add to Panel\".\nHow to do the same in Unity 2D?\nWell what I mean is how to add additional indicators like Weather, RSS... that seems to be missing as I cannot right click on the panl and add one.\n\nA: A possible alternative I found is to add a gnome panel to unity.\nYou can experiment the solution by open a terminal and type\ngnome-panel\nI placed one single gnome panel at the bottom of the screen. In that panel you can place whatever you want as usual. It's also good for find resources, open windows and administrative tools (not immediate to find with unity interface).\nIf you like the solution you can autostart your new panel everytime you log in by adding an entry in: administration->session (or something similar, I haven't English locale set).\nI hope this help\n\nA: Neither Unity or Unity 2D will support applets, see here for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use GNOME applets in Unity?\n\n*What Application Indicators are available? has alternatives\n\n\nUnity Lenses might be an option if you'd like to extend Unity.\n", "Q: Which numbers does fdisk show? I have run sudo fdisk -l and have got the following information:\nDisk /dev/sda: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\n\nThis utility shows the whole size of the hard disk (120034123776 bytes) and its number of heads (255 heads), sectors per track (63 sectors/track) and number of cylinders (14593 cylinders). \nMultiplying heads X sectors per track X number of cylinders we must have number of sectors in the disk. \n255 X 63 X 14593 = 234436545\n\nHaving in mind that every sector is of size 512 bytes, we have \n234436545 X 512 = 120031511040\n\nIn fact, 120031511040 != 120034123776, therefore, the question is: does fdisk shows incorrect information or there is something that I have missed in my calculations?\n\nA: I'd say the use of cylinder is now deprecated and used mainly for historical reasons.\nBy looking at the fdisk source code it seems to me that the total number of bytes of a device is retrieved via an ioctl call\n    if (ioctl(fd, BLKGETSIZE64, bytes) >= 0)\n        return 0;\n\nand the other figures are then derived from this. \nFor instance the number of cylinders is calculated using\nllcyls = total_number_of_sectors / (heads * sectors * sector_factor);\n\nThe \"problem\" here is that the result of this division is truncated (rounded down), so it is bound to be imprecise.\nUsing your fdisk output as an example\n120034123776 bytes / 512 bytes_per_sector / 255 / 63 = 14593.3176471 cylinders\n\nbut the fdisk output will round this down to 14593.\n\nA: Hmmm, as far as I see the difference is marginal, so it can be caused by the different meaning of \"kilo\", \"mega\" and \"giga\" (prefixes) in the IT world and the SI: in normal life eg \"kilo\" means 1000, while in IT the common habit was 1024. Now the confusion is even bigger, since there is propose (even in ubuntu) to use 1000 as kilo, and use \"kibi\" (or whatever ....) for 1024 if needed. So by using these prefixes someone means 1000, others 1024, and to be even more complicated, in case of HDDs things are even mixed, that some of the prefixes are power of 2, some of them are power of 10. \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy \nIt's a bit complicated/confusing situation on other OSes too ...\n", "Q: Hardware Divers option is not there \nPossible Duplicate:\n“Hardware Drivers” item missing from menu \n\nI just installed the newest version of Ubuntu (10.10) and I am trying to get the appropriate drivers installed for the nvidia ion.\nHowever there is no system > administration > hardware drivers option in the toolbar.

How can I automatically create a list of files and folders in a given folder in LibreOffice Calc ?\nI'd like it to have as much info as possible (size, name, folder hierarchy...) sorted in nice little cells.\nI'd rather not dump it to a file using ls and then trying to sort it manually: it creates an awful output.\n\nA: Your best bet would be to use a scripting language (Ruby, Python, Perl etc.) to create a text file in CSV format with this data. Calc can import CSV text files as spreadsheets.\nAn example Ruby script to get you started:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nrequire 'csv'\ntable = [['Name', 'Size', 'Path']] #These are your headings - you can change them\nDir['./*'].each do |file|\n    table << [File.basename(file), File.size(file), File.expand_path(file)]\n    #You can add extra columns with extra information in the above line\nend\nFile.open('output.csv', 'w') do |f|\n    f.puts table.map {|row| CSV.generate_line(row) }.join(\"\\n\")\nend\n\nRun this in the appropriate directory then open the file 'output.csv' with Calc.

Tell it to install 3rd party software during install and it will activate it before partitioner comes up.  connect to your wifi, continue install.\n\nA: I am not an advanced user but been using Ubuntu since 2005\nYou can actually do and at the same time you cant,\nScenario 1 - Getting live just ONCE\nWhen you get Live through your usb stick, just get a wired cable, and install the wireless drivers. Once you are done with it, surf internet using your wireless NIC card. Okay i know that sounds lame.\nScenario 2 - Getting live again and again\nGet your ubuntu iso image burned on a cd or dvd (whatever suits you). Get live, and install ubuntu on the usb disk.\nNow whenever you plug the usb, you ll find that ubuntu is actually installed over it (saving + dynamic storage). Get a wired connection for a while and install the drivers once. And enjoy using wireless every time you boot from usb.\nNote: I dont know, may be there are ways to tweak the image.
