["Q: Store grive command output to variable in bash script I am trying to create a script that syncs my computer with google drive using the grive tool. I would like to store the output of the grive command to a bash variable, but I can't seem to get it to work.\nSome googling has taught me that command outputs can be saved to variables using the following syntax:\nVARABLENAME=$(command)\nand the output can be later printed by\necho ${VARIABLENAME}\nHowever, the grive command seems to be an exception to this because when I use this syntax, it still prints out the output in the terminal and the contents of the variable is empty.\nHow I can store the output of grive in a variable properly?\n\nA: The problem was that grive command was outputting to the error stream, STDERR (File descriptor 2), which is normally used for passing error messages while the STDOUT (File descriptor 1) is used for showing actual (upon success) output of any program (strictly speaking).\nI have not used grive, but according to your words the developer might have used STDERR only to show any messages from the command.\nNow the command substitution you have used :\nVARABLENAME=$(command)\n\nwill save the STDOUT of command to VARABLENAME, not STDERR. As a result the variable was empty and you were seeing messages on terminal.\nI have suggested :\nVARABLENAME=\"$(command 2>&1)\"\n\nthis will save both the STDOUT and STDERR to the variable (in your case just STDERR as there is no STDOUT), So you would get desired result using echo \"${VARIABLENAME}\".\nAlso as there is no STDOUT you can save just the STDERR to the variable (generalization, true for any such program) :\nVARABLENAME=\"$(command 2>&1 >/dev/null)\"\n\n", "Q: Problem installing printers' drivers on ubuntu 14.04 LTS Some time ago I tried to install my laser printer, a Brother hl-1112 and the installation appeared to be correct, but it only prints blank pages.

I'm confused about how the package management system works in the case I'm about to describe.  I found similar questions on askubuntu but I don't understand the system well enough to apply what I read to my situation, namely:\nI first installed Apache2 version 2.4.7 from the repo.  But, in order to get some advanced modsecurity firewall rules to work, I installed version 2.4.10 by downloading a .deb from the official Ubuntu site at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2. \nSo, is my system going to automatically check for updates on this package?  I assume I'd get none until if and when the repos are updated to contain 2.4.10.  But maybe I'm wrong about that.  \nAnd more importantly, is there a general way to tell by using apt if a package is being checked for updates?\n\nA: You will never get updates for manually installed packages, which are not installed by a PPA or by the Ubuntu repositories. You have to download the deb file again and again for each new version.\nIn your case, you have installed the version for Vivid from the officially Ubuntu Launchpad site. If you start a upgrade to Vivid, you will get updates for your Apache version.\n", "Q: Cannot get cron.service status using systemctl I noticed my cronjobs were running at the incorrect times, so I changed my time zone.

Windows came as a OEM with the laptop so I didn't delete it as I paid for it and I am not using it though. I want to know if I do the free upgrade to Windows 10 will it destroy my Ubuntu partitions? or will  it mess up anything in the boot files or grub?\n\nA: I just upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7, and the update manager did not bother on touching grub or other partitions. It just upgraded its own partition.\nI used the Microsoft Media Creation Tool to upgrade. (I was impatient)\n\nA: I think the upgrade will surely replace GRUB and the windows bootloader will not recognize ubuntu so you will have to repair it by booting from ubuntu liveusb and running boot-repair tool. I don't think the ubuntu partition will be affected.\n\nA: You Ubuntu install should not be affected, but you will need to reinstall GRUB by manually booting into Ubuntu using your BIOS boot menu, and running this command in Terminal:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n\nA: I just downloaded the free upgrade to Windows 10 last night on my dual boot laptop (I had windows 8.1/Ubuntu 15.04 working fine).

Your OS is unable to continue up to the six init levels required for normal startup. It is seemingly stuck at the first init run level which happens when something is broken.I suggest that instead of trying to salvage this situation you perform a fresh re-install of Ubuntu.

I am currently running Ubuntu Gnome 15.04, with Gnome 3.14, and I am contemplating upgrading to Gnome 3.16, in the article here I read that:\n\nThe stable release of GNOME 3.16 arrived in March.\nIt comes with a bunch of neat app updates, a new look ‘shell’ and a\n  slick new notification center. All great stuff, but all arriving too\n  late in the Ubuntu development cycle to be included by default in\n  Ubuntu 15.04.\nSince GNOME is an intrinsic part of the regular Unity desktop used by\n  millions around the around the decision was made to stick with the\n  older, but thoroughly tested, GNOME 3.14 release.\nYou can, should want to you, upgrade GNOME 3.14 to 3.16 in Ubuntu —\n  but it’s not recommended.\nUpgrading GNOME involves more than a few apps and icon themes. You are\n  swapping out older, well tested components of your operating system\n  for newer, largely untested replacements.\nIf you’re entomophobic (a fancy word for being scared of bugs) or hate\n  software headaches (no fancy word for that) this tutorial is not for\n  you.\nTo repeat: you can upgrade to GNOME 3.16 in Ubuntu 15.04 but it is not\n  recommended and may not give stable, reliable experience at the end.\n\nSo they are basically telling me that I shouldn't upgrade if I don't want major problems. Would they have said the same thing even if 3.16 had been released at a time when it could have been put as the default for Ubuntu 15.04? Would they then be saying that you shouldn't upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04 if you don't want big problems with Gnome?\nSo basically what I am getting at is are there any problems that would occur if I upgraded to Gnome 3.16, that would not have been present if Ubuntu 15.04 had included Gnome 3.16 as default?\nNote: Please don't close this as primarily opinion-based, because I am not looking for opinions, I am looking for facts. I just want to know if there is any more danger in upgrading to it, than there would be if it was just included as default.\n\nA: My opinion based answer is, I have fewer problems with GNOME 3.16 as with GNOME 3.14 in my GNOME Ubuntu 15.04 with proprietary nvidia drivers.\nA warning for not supported software is always good to avoid discussions.\nGNOME 3.16 is released since weeks and the PPAs have some patches included. That's a good sign for me.\nOk, maybe there are some apps which not work properly, eg. GNOME Music. But that's not a real problem.\nI would never get back GNOME 3.14.\n", "Q: Error make: *** [.obj/channel.o] Error 1 Can anybody help me?\nwhen i built project qsopcast-0.3.4\nthequang@thequang-Inspiron-N4030:~/qsopcast-0.3.4/src$ qmake\nthequang@thequang-Inspiron-N4030:~/qsopcast-0.3.4/src$ make\ng++ -c -pipe -g -Wall -W -O2 -D_REENTRANT  -DALSA -DQT_NO_DEBUG -DQT_THREAD_SUPPORT -I/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs/default -I. -I. -I/usr/share/qt3/include -I.moc/ -o .obj/channel.o channel.cpp\nIn file included from channel.cpp:21:0:\nheader.h:4:26: fatal error: qapplication.h: No such file or directory\n #include <qapplication.h>\n                          ^\ncompilation terminated.\nmake: *** [.obj/channel.o] Error 1\n\n\nA: Install libqt4-dev or qtbase5-dev\n", "Q: How to log in to an internet provider with with a password and user name through terminal?

Hopefully that will work. Now your question how can I tell if it's done? Assuming you have ubuntu go to the GNOME-System_Monitor and go to the Procceses tab, and when your copying the files the nautilis file manager might be on the top. When it goes down back then the files have probably been copied. Another way is to go under the Performance tab. When you are coping the files the disk might go up on the graph. But when it goes down it is probably done. Finally you can copy the files via terminal. Go to your GNOME-Terminal and type in this command.\ncp (File being copied) (Destination folder)\nwhen it is done you will see something like this\nnicholas@nicholas-desktop:~$\nAlso the drive or the drive writer might be corrupted.\nIn that case you might have to buy a new drive or use a different drive port on your computer.\n", "Q: SSH and VPN Cisco connection working on one laptop but not on another.

Others can be discovered using e.g. dpkg -L network-manager-vpnc, which lists all the files installed by that package.

Looking at the list of supported cards in the newest AMD release, R3 seems to be present.\nI did find this page on phoronix, where it seems he used X Server 1.15.1 with fglrx 13.35.5 to make it work. But I have xorg 1.16 and am not sure how to downgrade it in order to try.\nWhat am I missing, what else can I try??\nThanks!\n\nA: D'oh. The answer can be found in the fitlet wiki. The newer fglrx driver (15.200) seems to not support the card, which is a bug. Thus, you have to use fglrx 13.350. This is troublesome with ubuntu 14.04*.2*, since that includes a newer xorg-abi which this old driver isn't compatible with anymore. For me, I could work around this issue by using instructions found here.\nThe question that remains is why my previous attempt of using 13.350 didn't work.

Should I install either 32 or 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS ?\n\nA: The documentation for Ubuntu tells you what hardware specs you need in order to install and run Ubuntu. Since Ubuntu requires less RAM than Windows, you probably have enough RAM.\nPersonally, I would not keep Windows and instead simply replace it entirely with Ubuntu since you may run into issues with the drive partitioning. If you absolutely need to run Windows 7, you can always install a Windows virtual machine (i.e. a vagrant box). \nAs to whether you need 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu, you can find out what your system is running by following the steps listed here.\n\nA: 1 G of ram is not enough to run ubuntu 14.04 here are the minimal system requirements \nyou may consider lighter distros like Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\n", "Q: How to use unallocated place to drive I want to use the unallocated space of my hard drive, I want to create a new drive or filesystem of that place and want to use.

Then you will be able to create many logical partitions inside it.\nIn your case the easiest way will be to re-install Ubuntu. Your partitioning is wrong and it will take lots of effort get it right.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is absolutely no need to have a separate /opt partition.\n\n*You have already 4 primary partitions and the extended partition is in a very awkward place aside to / to move everything.\n\n*Moving the / partition will require to re-install grub.\nThat is not impossible to move sda3 and sda4 to the right, then extend ext2, and then create some new partitions inside sda2.\nBut I do not see a reason to have this type of partitioning.\nThat is why I recommend to re-install. You can create one extended partition and inside it /, /home and /swap. And you can live space for installing Windows or other OS`s on 3 other primary partitions, if you like.\n", "Q: how do I image a drive to an uncompressed file?

No no, hold your applause.\n", "Q: windows 10 and ubuntu dual boot will we face same problem in installing ubuntu alongside windows 10 as we  faced while installing ubuntu alongside windows 8? Did microsoft fixed it?\n\nA: Let me write about some of problems to help other people who might encounter the same issues.\nMy computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed so I shrunk the Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu. That it how it works for the last year.\nAfter the second reboot in Windows 10 upgrade the computer did not boot any more. The grub only displayed a grub rescue command prompt. I found out later that the problem occurred because windows somehow changed the partition scheme. The boot partition was no longer where grub expected it. I don't know how and why this happened.\nFirst what you can do is to see the partitions in grub rescue with \"ls\". Mine were (hd0,gpt1), (hd0,gpt2), etc. Try to find out which partition is your boot partition. I tried the following commands until i found the right partition:\nls (hd0,gpt1)/\n\nls (hd0,gpt1)/boot\n\nls (hd0,gpt2)/\n\netc.\nThen type set in grub rescue prompt. It will display where the grub looks for its files. In my case (hd0,gpt6) has moved to (hd0,gpt7). The set command displayed:\nprefix=(hd0,gpt6)/boot/grub\n\nroot=hd0,gpt6\n\nChange the prefix and root settings to point to the right partition. In my case commands were:\nset prefix=(hd0,gpt7)/boot/grub\n\nset root=(hd0,gpt7)\n\nThen switch from rescue to normal mode:\ninsmod normal\n\nnormal\n\nYou should get the normal grub menu. From now on you can boot Windows and finish your Windows upgrade. The problem is that you have to tell grub rescue about the right partitions on every reboot. That is how I did it. I left the problem of grub for later because I was not sure whether Windows will do some more changes to the partitions or boot.\nWhen Windows finished I started to solve grub problems. Press \"e\" to edit boot options for Ubuntu. I changed all (hd0,gpt6) to (hd0,gpt7) and Ubuntu booted. However, I use encrypted partition and cryptswap. At the boot Ubuntu asked me for the passphrase. Fortunately I saved it at the installation of Ubuntu and entered it at the boot. Ubuntu booted without problems. I corrected the /boot/grub/grub.cfg where I replaced (hd0,gpt6) with (hd0,gpt7) and performed sudo grub-install.\nNow it was only the encryption. Since the root Ubuntu partition was raised for one (7 from 6), the swap partition suffered a similar change. I had to change the /etc/crypttab file to point to /dev/sda8 instead of /dev/sda7.\nI am using only two partitions for Ubuntu (root and swap). If other operating systems coexisting with windows use more partitions there might be more changes required. Especially if partitions are mounted according to their numbers and not by their UUIDs. Take a look at your /etc/fstab. If the partitions are identified by UUID there should be no problems. But if there are /dev/... lines the number should be corrected if they were changed.\n\nA: I believe the rEFInd Boot Manager works for this:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\nHere are some other boot loaders to consider:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_boot_loaders\n", "Q: Problems turning off the wireless card I am trying to turn off wireless using the ifconfig command ifconfig wlan0 down\nand nothing happens no errors displayed in the terminal and wireless networks are still displayed in the network manager.\nI can't shut down the system right now cause i'm working in other things.\nany solution to turn off the wireless ? thanks\n\nA: You can turn wireless off in Network Manager command-line\nnmcli nm wifi off\n\n", "Q: install bbswitch to disable nvdia graphic card i want to permanently disable nvidia gcard on my laptop. i just finished installation of ubuntu. so please post every step. and there is no option on in BIOS to disable gpu. ubuntu is 14.04. laptop=hp 15 r203tx\ngp is 820m\n\nA: I suggest to install proper driver for this adapter and disable it using nvidia-prime.

Completely - I mean neither windows, nor Ubuntu, nor even UEFI see them.

On the SSD is both, Windows and Ubuntu, installed. Now I want to move my /home folder to the HDD on a seperate partition. How much space do I have to give the OS on the SSD? What changes the size of the OS? \nThat's where I'm quite unsure. I don't want too much space wasted. \nThanks (:\n\nA: There is no one-size-fits-all answer for this.\nYou can easily determine the size of the OS as it is now using the df and du commands. The real question however is how much more space are you going to use in the future for the OS ?\nThe size of the OS grows by packages you install and, to a lesser extent, by updates of already installed packages. In the 'Software Updater' or 'Software Centre' you can set up the update behaviour (automatic or manual).\nSo it all depends on what you plan to install additionally.\nTo create some more space for the OS you can remove some files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded packages are kept in /var/cache/apt/archives and can be removed using sudo apt-get clean. \n\n*Kernel updates end up in /boot and older kernels must be removed manually (they are never removed automatically).\n\n*If space becomes a problem you can always move some directories of the OS from the SSD to your HDD and then softlink them back (ln -s). \n\n\nIf you move your home drive from the SSD to the HDD, then there will be more space left for the OS. The home drive is often the biggest hogger of disk space. This might solve your problem already, at least partially.\nMy OS is also on an SSD (160GB) and occupies 140GB. My home drive is on a separate 240GB HDD and occupies 60GB.\n", "Q: What will happen to my Ubuntu/Windows set up upon upgrade to Windows 10?

I've not installed any of these applications before and I was wondering if any of them support this on Ubuntu. If they do, how would I go about setting that up?\n\nA: I'm using vsftpd on an internal server, so I can only answer for that one…\nvsftpd has basically two parameters to control the directory listing in its /etc/vsftpd.conf\ndirlist_enable\n    If set to NO, all directory list commands will give permission denied.\n\n    Default: YES\n\ndirmessage_enable\n    If enabled, users of the FTP server can be shown messages when they \n    first enter a new directory. By default, a directory is scanned for\n    the file .message, but that may be overridden with the configuration \n    setting message_file.\n\n    Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it) \n\ndownload_enable\n    If set to NO, all download requests will give permission denied.\n\n    Default: YES \n\nSo in your case, you should definitely add:\ndirlist_enable=NO\n\nas a minimum and depending on your use-case, also disable downloads and dirmessages.  (and that's why I added the download_enable parameter, which doesn't really control any directory listings)\nSource: man vsftpd.conf\nHaving said all that, on a public server, I wouldn't allow standard ftp to run any more, but would use something like sftp.\n\nA: If you have setup OpenSSH on this machine, you have built-in sftp for all user accounts. Most modern ftp clients have builtin support for sftp. It is also much more secure than regular ftp and the overhead tax for using encryption is minimal. In fact, over my local network, sftp is faster than ftp. Give it a shot, it operates on the same port as ssh and even works while using ssh-key login.\nGive it a shot, you also save yourself the resources of running another process altogether.  \n\nA: ProFTPD has nice features and actually is a great choice.

Legacy versions are long-lived, and don't get feature updates but only bug-fixes. The current long-lived branch is base version 352, and short-lived is 355. Base version 331 is a short-lived branch that has expired so it isn't updated any more (not even bug-fixes like the legacy 340 does). The only drivers for Linux that are still updated are the ones shown on the link above (legacy and current long & short lived branches). \n", "Q: Can't reach tomcat server on Ubuntu 14.04 host from VirtualBox 4.3 Windows 7 guest or Ubuntu 14.04 guest I've tried the following posts, as well as skimming through the VirtualBox manual:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows GUEST accessing my local webserver on Ubuntu HOST?\n\n*VirtualBox WinXP GUEST accessing HOST local webserver?\nI have a fresh Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS installation.  I installed the version of VirtualBox 4.3 available through the software center.  I created two images, a Windows 7 image which I got from the modern.ie site, and an Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS image which I created from an ISO disk image download from the Ubuntu site.\nOn the host computer, I am running a Tomcat server at port 8080.\nThe problem I'm having is that using 10.0.2.2 in my guest system hosts files as indicated in other threads does not work.  I've tried both the bridged and default NAT network configurations.  I also disabled the firewall in the Windows guest just in case.\nMy Ubuntu guest hosts file:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   myguestimage\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\n10.0.2.2 myhostimage.site.org\n\nMy Windows guest hosts file:\n# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.\n#\n# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.\n#\n(SNIP!)\n\n10.0.2.2 myhostimage.site.org\n\nThe network tab on each of my Virtual Host boxes looks like this:\n\nWhen I browse to http://myhostimage.site.org:8080 from a browser on either host image, the connection times out.  I'm expecting to see the Tomcat server.\nNext I tried switching to bridged networking, which didn't work.\nThen I tried changing 10.0.2.2 in the guest hosts files to the IP address of my host (192.168.1.41), which I got from running ifconfig.  This hasn't worked either.\nIn the bridged/192.168.1.41 configuration, I ran nmap on the guest against the address of the host tomcat server and got the following.\nme@myguestimage:~$ nmap myhostimage.site.org -p 8080\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-07-29 16:23 CDT\nNmap scan report for myhostimage.site.org (192.168.1.41)\nHost is up (0.00012s latency).\nPORT     STATE  SERVICE\n8080/tcp closed http-proxy\n\nWhat should I try next?\n\nA: The nmap results were the biggest hint that the problem was not the network configuration with VirtualBox.  The issue was with Tomcat.\nI opened the conf/server.xml file in my Tomcat home directory.  Then I changed the line\n<Connector port=\"8080\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" \n               connectionTimeout=\"20000\" \n               redirectPort=\"8443\"\n               address=\"myhostimage.site.org\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\"/>\n\nto \n<Connector port=\"8080\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" \n               connectionTimeout=\"20000\" \n               redirectPort=\"8443\"\n               address=\"0.0.0.0\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\"/>\n\nSuddenly, I could reach my host Tomcat from the guest VirtualBoxes.  I even changed my VirtualBox settings back to NAT/10.0.2.2 and it still works.\nI prefer the NAT/10.0.2.2 solution because I work on a laptop which I move from network to network, where it gets new IP addresses from DHCP.  If I have to put the IP address in all of the hosts files, that's a pain.\n", "Q: Error removing an HDD from a RAID1 BTRFS array I setup a btrfs filesystem on 3 disks with RAID 1. Somehow, a small portion (2GiB) got used as RAID0. At the time, no amount of running btrfs balance -dconvert raid1 -mconvert raid1 would change it so I left it as is.\nLately /dev/sda is starting to show SMART errors and general issues. So I added 2 other disks to the btrfs array, and then proceded to run btrfs device delete. All of the data was correctly moved out of sda except 1 GiB, and the delete fails with this message:\n> # ./btrfs device delete /dev/sda /storage \nERROR: error removing the device '/dev/sda' - No space left on device\n\nIt seems there is a small part of sda that still has a RAID 0 partition, and that small part cannot be deleted. This is a completely uninformed assumption! It's just that the 1 GiB space remaining on disk seems suspicious.\nI don't know what files are there, and at this point I really don't care. I would like to nuke that 1 GiB partition so I can remove /dev/sda and get my array working correctly.\nI tried to run a balance -dconvert again, but the command starts moving my data back into sda and I don't trust the disk to die on me while writing that much data.\nAny tips or suggestions are apreciated!

I had a 4 disk LAMP system running Ubuntu 10 then upgraded to 12. The drives are managed by LVM since initial setup. Recently, one of the drive failed (the newest and largest of course, 3TB). I sent it to a data recovery service to try to recover the data, now they are telling me that I have a RAID setup and they would need all of my 4 drives to do the recovery, and of course charge me x4 the price.\nSo I'm a little confused as to why they would need all 4 of my drive to be able to recover my 1 failed disk. As far as I remember I had 2 logical volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"System\" logical volume contained the Linux OS, and a single physical disk.\n\n*The \"Data\" logical volume included 3 physical disk, with the \"/home\" directory entirely on the physical drive that failed.\nThis failed disk contained only my /home directory, although the logical volume contained 2 other disks the /home data is completely contain on that one disk (i.e. not spread to a second physical disk or striped like in a real RAID).\n\n\nI guess my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Ubuntu LVM using some sort of RAID underneath?\n\n*If not, what would be the reason why the data recovery service would need all of my drives to make the recovery?\n\n*Can I read the contents of a physical volume that was part of a logical volume (like my failed disk above) independently on a separate machine (like an external HD)?\n\n\nA: \nIs Ubuntu LVM using some sort of RAID underneath?\n\nNo, not so far as I know (although it is possible to configure LVM on top of RAID i.e. with one or more RAID arrays as physical volumes - I assume you didn't do that).\n\nIf not, what would be the reason why the data recovery service would need all of my drives to make the recovery?\n\nPossibly just that the volume group (VG) could not be activated without all of its constituent physical volumes (PVs) - regardless of whether any of their physical extents were actually allocated to a logical volume (LV).\n\nCan I read the contents of a physical volume that was part of a logical volume (like my failed disk above) independently on a separate machine (like an external HD)?\n\nYou would still need to activate the VG I think. I have very limited experience with LVM, however the vgchange manpage mentions a --partial flag that may allow you to activate a VG with one or more of its constituent PVs missing: the option seems to be more fully documented in the lvm (8) manpage man 8 lvm\n   -P, --partial\n          When set, the tools will do their best to provide access to Vol‐\n          ume Groups that are only partially available (one or more Physi‐\n          cal  Volumes  belonging to the Volume Group are missing from the\n          system).  Where part of a logical volume is missing,  /dev/ioer‐\n          ror  will  be  substituted,  and you could use dmsetup(8) to set\n          this up to return I/O errors when accessed, or create  it  as  a\n          large  block  device of nulls.  Metadata may not be changed with\n          this option. To insert a replacement Physical Volume of the same\n          or large size use pvcreate -u to set the uuid to match the orig‐\n          inal followed by vgcfgrestore(8).\n\nYou may also want to look at the vgreduce command, in particular its --removemissing option\n   --removemissing\n          Removes  all  missing physical volumes from the volume group, if\n          there are no logical volumes allocated on  those.  This  resumes\n          normal  operation  of  the volume group (new logical volumes may\n          again be created, changed and so on).\n\n", "Q: Windows 10 upgrade led to grub rescue I was dual-booting Windows 7 and Linux Ubuntu on my desktop, and today is the day they gave out free Windows 10 upgrades.

And I couldn't follow the video tutorial any more than that...\nI teased my brain a little and determined that sda2 contained my Windows system (since I remember my C: drive has around 700-ish GB of space).  After thinking a little bit more, I remember assigning around 200-ish GB of my hard disk space to something that's Ubuntu related when installing Ubuntu.  I don't exactly remember which, but I think it was basically Ubuntu \"hard disk space\", and it didn't have any boot files in them.  I assigned two other things for linux, but they were very small in size (not breaking the 1 GB mark yet).\nSo, can anyone here help me out get my upgrade back on track?  I won't mind if I end up having to completely remove the partitions that have Linux in them.\n\nA: My computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed so I shrunk the Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu. That is how it worked for the last year.\nAfter the second reboot in Windows 10 upgrade the computer did not boot any more. GRUB only displayed a grub rescue command prompt. I found out later that the problem occurred because Windows somehow changed the partition scheme. The boot partition (containing normal GRUB data) was no longer where GRUB expected it. I don't know how and why this happened.\nThe first thing that you can do in the rescue mode is to see the partitions with the ls command. Mine were:\n\n\n*\n\n*(hd0,gpt1),\n\n*(hd0,gpt2),\n\n*etc.\n\n\nTry to find out which partition is your boot partition. There is no Tab completion, you have to type it out completely. I tried the following commands until I found the right partition:\nls (hd0,gpt1)/\nls (hd0,gpt1)/boot\nls (hd0,gpt2)/\n\netc.\nThen type set in the same prompt. It will display where GRUB looks for its files. In my case (hd0,gpt6) has moved to (hd0,gpt7). The set command displayed:\nprefix=(hd0,gpt6)/boot/grub\nroot=hd0,gpt6\n\nTo get back into normal GRUB, start by changing the prefix setting to point to the right partition. In my case the command was:\nset prefix=(hd0,gpt7)/boot/grub\n\nThen you can switch from rescue to normal mode:\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\nOne could also have fixed the root setting with:\nset root=(hd0,gpt7)\n\nBut this is not strictly necessary, as it doesn't matter for Windows chain-load entries. Once in the normal GRUB menu, you can boot Windows and finish your Windows upgrade. The problem is that you have to tell grub rescue about the right partitions on every reboot. That is how I did it. I left the problem of GRUB for later because I was not sure whether Windows would do some more changes to the partitions or boot.\nWhen Windows finished I started to solve GRUB problems. Press e to edit boot options for Ubuntu. I changed all (hd0,gpt6) to (hd0,gpt7) and Ubuntu booted.\nHowever, I use encrypted partition and cryptswap. At the boot Ubuntu asked me for the passphrase. Fortunately I saved it at the installation of Ubuntu and entered it at the boot. Ubuntu booted without problems.\nI then corrected the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file where I replaced (hd0,gpt6) with (hd0,gpt7) and performed:\nsudo grub-install\n\nAt that point the only remaining issue was the encryption. Since the root Ubuntu partition number was increased by one (7 instead of 6), the swap partition suffered a similar change. I had to change the /etc/crypttab file to point to /dev/sda8 instead of /dev/sda7.\nI am using only two partitions for Ubuntu (root and swap). If other operating systems coexisting with Windows use more partitions there might be more changes required. Especially if partitions are mounted according to their numbers and not by their UUIDs. Take a look at your /etc/fstab. If the partitions are identified by UUID there should be no problems. But if there are /dev/... lines the number should be corrected if these partitions had been renumbered.\n\nA: It's a nasty bug in the Windows partitioner, and not Linux specific.  It ironically deleted an NTFS partition in my case.\nThe Windows 10 installer creates a new partition (your /dev/sda3) carved off the end of the main Windows partition sda2 if the Windows boot partition sda1 is too small to contain the Windows 10 Recovery Environment.\nWhen it rewrites the partition table to do this, for every logical partition in the extended partition table sda4, if it is located on the disk before the previous partition number, it gives up.\nIn your case your Linux partitions were located on your disk before your new sda5, but had higher partition numbers than sda5 had before the repartitioning.\nIf you look through the huge Windows 10 upgrade logs, you will see a message something like \"6 before 5, Nothing to do\", along with the old and new partition tables.\nWindows does not overwrite the contents of the partitions it deletes, so it is possible to recover them if you can find where they are. In my case I had backups of the partition table, but using testdisk as explained in oldfred's answer has an excellent chance of finding them all.  Parted rescue will be hard to use as more than one partition was deleted in your case.\nTo use testdisk from your Ubuntu Live CD, in a terminal type sudo apt-get install testdisk to install it, and sudo testdisk to run.\nAfter repairing the partition table, the Linux partition containing GRUB may now have a different number to before, so you might still end up at the GRUB rescue prompt.  If so, Boot Repair will now be able to fix GRUB.\nAgain, using your Ubuntu Live CD, type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nto install and run it.\nNow Windows can complete its upgrade.\n\nA: Installing windows (or upgrading it) alongside linux can be problematic.\n\nTry this:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\n\nI used it to fix a problem after I installed the Windows 10 tech preview, and it worked. Basically, what it does is reinstall grub to work with all currently installed operating systems. Make sure to tell it to install grub to your linux partition (sd#).\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: Before changing partitions, make a backup and save to another device. If not sda change to correct drive. Then you can start over if you restore incorrect set with testdisk. You just want all current plus missing Logical when restoring with testdisk.\nsudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda > parts.txt\n\nYour missing partition is here or between start of extended partition at 1547... & first partition shown at 1915...:\n/dev/sda4      1547945982  1953521663   202787841    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5      1915731968  1953521663    18894848    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nYou can use testdisk, but it uses CHS. You have to choose all existing partitions and the missing partition as logical. It may show many versions depending on how many times you changed partitions around. So choose the size that matches the missing without overlapping any other current partitions. \nSome that have correctly restore were just able to boot, others has to reinstall grub. And some could not correct restore partition.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nAnother restore tool is parted rescue. It uses sectors, but range you give must be just outside the missing partition with no overlap to current partitions. Best if you know exact start & end. See man parted\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_node/rescue.html\nUser who used parted rescue:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1775331&p=10905969#post10905969\n\nA: To use boot-repair you need to set in BIOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable UEFI (in my BIOS it is:)\nLegacy support DISABLE\n\n*Disable Secure Boot\nProbably you have Secure Boot enabled, so you get \"incorrectly signed file\" error.\n", "Q: Unity hangs at login after upgrade to 15.04 This appears to be an issue for many.

How can I download the source code and install the package using apt-get install command?\n\nA: @heemayl answer tells you how to get the source code but in case you are wondering\n\nhow come the package is installed without using the source code?\n\nIt is because Ubunutu does not build packages from source and instead downloads precompiled binaries.\nA distro like Gentoo Linux however would download the source and build a package locally.\n\nA: By default apt-get install does not download the source codes of packages. There is a specific apt-get option to do that which is source. \nFrom man apt-get:\n\nsource\n             source causes apt-get to fetch source packages. APT will examine the available packages to decide which source package\n             to fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the newest available version of that source package\n             while respecting the default release, set with the option APT::Default-Release, the -t option or per package with the\n             pkg/release syntax, if possible.\nSource packages are tracked separately from binary packages via deb-src lines in the sources.list(5) file. This means\n             that you will need to add such a line for each repository you want to get sources from; otherwise you will probably get\n             either the wrong (too old/too new) source versions or none at all.\n\nSo the syntax to download the source package of something to the current directory would be (no need to be root):\napt-get source <package_name>\n\nAlso note that as the man pages says you need to have the deb-src repositories enabled for all the regular deb repositories you want to keep track of source packages.

On android this is not the case. Even with 3G/4G disable, you do get this notification SMS which ask you to download the MMS. With that notification, you enable 3G/4G and go ahead with the download.\nOn Ubuntu touch, if someone would like to send you a MMS, he or she have to send you prior to the MMS, a SMS, asking you to enable the 3G/4G.

When you did read email, you created the $email variable. You can check its value by typing echo $email\n>> is a redirection operator that appends to a file and creates it if it doesn't exist. It's different from > which overwrites anything already in the file if one exists.\n\"\" are weak quotes. Variables are expanded inside such quotes. In strong quotes (''), everything is interpreted literally, meaning if you put a $ in there, it would not reference a variable.\n\\ is for escaping characters. Notice how Phone\\ Book has this? Well this means that I escaped the space character, so the file I created is literally Phone Book. Without it, it would be just create a file called Phone\n\nIf you really want to get a better platform for programming, you should download the Ubuntu SDK, and try developing this program using a language called \"QML\" aka \"QtQuick\".\nBash Programming is still important though, so it's good for you to learn those skills as well. \n", "Q: What's in ~/.config/google-chrome?

So beyond the configuration it will contain the History, bookmarks, cookies, extensions etc. \nTo minimise the disk usage, you can uninstall extensions you no longer use and get Chrome to clear it's cache/history.\n\nA: This is the configuration directory of google-chrome.

I have multiple USB drives, used for different purposes, and I've noticed they have different permissions when mounted, and, moreover, a chmod command has no effect. Why is this and is there a workaround to get the desired permissions?\n\nA: When you mount the USB drives you can specify the owner and the group with options uid and gid. For example:\n$ sudo mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/sdX /path/to/mountpoint\n\nIf you want to change permissions you can add the umask option too:\n$ sudo mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022 /dev/sdX /path/to/mountpoint\n\numask=022 will set the Owner to read, write, execute. Group and Others will have read, execute. \nYou can read more about umask here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Umask \n\nA: Your USB drive is formatted as an NTFS (i.e. windows) volume. mount assumes the files are owned by some windows user. You don't have a user mapping file (see man ntfs-3g, man ntfs-3g.usermap), so mount figures there's no point in managing the ownership and permissions, so it just sets them to whatever you tell it to (or whatever the default is).\nIf you pass -o permissions, chmod should work.\n", "Q: Dell XPS 13 (2015) Black Screen UPDATING:\nI followed every step of this guide but still getting the black screen with the system alive and can't go to tty1-6.

I read man exec output, but did not understand the difference between these two commands: exec ssh localhost and ssh localhost.\nI tested both commands and did not found any difference.

Is it overwriting rather than appending?  \nHow you can tell, is to give the history command, then give some other commands, date echo $PWD which man whatever, then run the history command. If there is any change, then the bash history file is likely being over written, rather than appended to. If its always the same, as in it wrote some command history a while ago, and hasn't changed since.... then IDK, but it would be nifty to know. \nAnyhow, I would bet the solution lies some place in your .bashrc file, where a variety of settings for dealing with history are kept. \nHere are some of the history settings from my .bashrc file:\n# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.\n# See bash(1) for more options\nHISTCONTROL=ignoreboth\n\n# append to the history file, don't overwrite it\nshopt -s histappend\n\n# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\nthe shopt built-in says If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.\nYou might search down to the bottom of your .bashrc if there are differing functions or parameters for the history command, the ones at the end of the file will take effect.\nif your .bashrc file looks like this, or if you can post further details, I will be happy to look into this further this evening.\nI am a bit suprized that xterm doesn't have a separate history log.\nIf you're ok with doing so, posting your .bashrc file may be helpful.\n", "Q: wired network connection in xubuntu not working with r8169 I am working on a brand new laptop with xubuntu 15.04.

I fixed the boot manager using a live cd with the boot-repair tool, but it only recognized the Ubuntu partition, and not the Windows one. \nSo I edited the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file and added the following contents:\nmenuentry \"Windows 10\" {\n    set root='(hd0,3)'\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nAfter running sudo update-grub2, I got an entry in the boot menu, but the partition does not load. It gives the following error:\nError: Invalid signature.\n\n\nDoes anybody know how one can overcome this error? \nMy most recent boot-repair dump is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11965327/, and the partition I want to boot is this one:\nsda4: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows 8/2012: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Windows/System32/winload.exe\n\n\nA: There are some peculiarities about your installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer has two Windows Recovery Environment partitions, /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda5. My guess is one is from your previous Windows installation and the other is for the new installation, but I can't be positive of that. I doubt if this duplication is causing you any problems per se; I mention it simply because it's a sign of a history of changes to the machine, and such changes may be both the cause of problems and make it difficult to figure out what's wrong.\n\n*Your EFI System Partition (ESP) is /dev/sda4. This is perfectly legal, but is unusual; the ESP is normally /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2. The ESP holds EFI-mode boot loaders and related files. My hunch is that the ESP was created late in the machine's history -- perhaps it was Ubuntu-only at one point and then you installed Windows, which created the ESP in this unusual location.\n\n*The Boot Info Script output doesn't identify any EFI boot loaders on the ESP. My suspicion is that they do exist, but the script has omitted these entries. (I've seen this happen from time to time.) OTOH, if those files are missing, then it means that Windows has failed to install its boot loader. The same may be true of Ubuntu, too; but see below....\n\n*Your disk uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which means that Windows will install to and boot from this disk only in EFI mode; but there's evidence of a BIOS-mode installation of GRUB, the standard Ubuntu boot loader. Such a mish-mash means that you'd not be able to boot Windows from a BIOS-mode GRUB on this computer. It could be you've also got an EFI-mode GRUB and had been booting that way; or maybe you had been switching between OSes by using the computer's built-in boot manager (typically accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key at start time).\n\n\nAt this point, your best bet is to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. There are two ways to do this that are relatively safe and easy. Both work best if you first enter your firmware and completely disable any option to boot using BIOS, CSM, or legacy mode. (Those are three terms for the same thing.) Sometimes these options are phrased the other way -- you must enable EFI or UEFI support. With that done, do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Method 1: Boot your Ubuntu install disk, ensure you've booted in EFI mode by looking for the /sys/firmware/efi directory (if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode), install the boot-repair package, and run it. This should repair your installation by installing an EFI version of GRUB. This usually works, but occasionally it doesn't. I realize you've already run Boot Repair, but my suspicion is that you ran it in BIOS mode, which of course means it would install the BIOS-mode GRUB, which will be useless for booting Windows.\n\n*Method 2: If you haven't done so already, disable Secure Boot in your firmware. You can then download and prepare a boot medium from the CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager. Boot to it; it should show you a menu with at least one option for each of Windows and Ubuntu. Test these to be sure you can boot both OSes, then boot Ubuntu. At this point, you can install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA. (Alternatively, you could install the EFI version of GRUB.) You may be able to re-enable Secure Boot at this point, but you may need to jump through some extra hoops to get it to work.\n\n\nThere should be no need to re-install Ubuntu, and probably not to re-install Windows. BIOS-mode and EFI-mode installations of Ubuntu are identical except for the boot loader (and related partitions -- but you've got the partitions to handle both modes).\n\nA: From the output of your boot-repair command, it looks like you have an UEFI system…\nHowever, Ubuntu is installed in non-UEFI mode, and Windows is installed in UEFI mode so only one of the two is going to work at a time without changing the boot parameters…\nThe best you can do is: re-install Windows 10 in non-UEFI mode or reinstall Ubuntu in UEFI mode depending on which you use most.\n\nA: As an alternative to have dual boot setup, you can try setting up Grub2Win, which is an implementation of GRUB installed from Windows and has UEFI support. Note that Grub2Win does not integrate with existing GRUB installation, it creates its own.\nOnce installed it would detect your UEFI boot option for Windows.\nIt may detect your Linux partition automatically, if it doesn't you can add the menu entry manually to C:\\grub2\\grub.cfg, you can grab menuentry from your existing grub.cfg in Linux (usually located at /boot/grub/grub.cfg), looks similar to this:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --class icon-linux {\n    insmod gzio\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='hd0,gpt6'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ###################\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-48-generic root=UUID=################### ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-48-generic\n}\n\nNote that instead of ###### above, you should use your Linux partition UUID, and should use the real boot image names installed in your /boot directory.\nThis enabled me to have Windows 10 + Ubuntu 20.04 dual boot setup successfully.\n", "Q: How to restore to default source list?

In your UEFI go to Boot and look for something similar to Boot Option Priorities and set Boot Option #1 to ubuntu (P#: drive name). This should set grub as your default boot device.

Any safe solution?\nI tried gparted as suggested in an answer, but have the same issue:\n\nUPDATE: finally shut down Windows. Now, instead of exclamation mark symbol, there is a symbol of lock near the Windows partition: \nUPDATE 2:\nUnable to read the contents of this file system!\nBecause of this some operations may be unavailable.\nThe cause might be a missing software package.\nThe following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support:  ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g\nI can mount and unmount the partition as you instructed me without problems, though.\n\nFinal solution: reinstalled lubuntu with different settings. I could have tried to move the partition and then resize it, but that would have taken much more time than just reinstalling the whole OS.\n\nA: It looks like your Windows system was hibernated and not actually shut down. That causes issues for Linux's ntfs3g driver. So, you need to boot back into Windows and shut it down cleanly. \nIn their infinite wisdom, the Microsoft developers decided to make it hard for users to shut down their machines. According to this site, you need to:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Mouse over the little gadget in the lower right corner of the screen. (You can also move your mouse cursor to the upper left corner;\n  same result. Or, you can press Windows-C on your keyboard.)\n  \n*In the slide-out menu (known as the Charms Bar) that appears, click Settings.\n  \n*Click the Power button, and then click your desired action: Sleep, Shut down, or Update and restart.\n\nThat's for Windows 8 though.

It should look something like this:\n\nWhile I have actually used gparted to resize NTFS partitions several times and have never had a problem, as always, you should backup your data first.\n", "Q: Steam doesn't start.

I'm using PuTTY on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) to connect to a serial port.\nI need to copy text from a PuTTY window to another window (for example, gedit).\nUPDATE\nI can copy by selecting text with the mouse and paste it by mouse middle click. But it does not work when I paste from another window.\nUPDATE1\nI haven't succeeded to fix this issue, but I've switched to the Ubuntu-native application GtkTerm which can copy-paste as usual from the Ubuntu terminal.\n\nA: I found the solution here\nProblem\nCopy Paste text from PuTTY to Another Application on Ubuntu not working\nsolution\nSelect the text you want to copy on the screen and leave as it is. This will copy the text to PuTTY clipboard.\npasting to other application:\nGo to the other application and press the middle button of the mouse. If your mouse only has two buttons, then press both left and right buttons simultaneously, it will paste the text on the other application. However, if you try to use CTRL + V , it will paste the content which is present in the default clipboard.\nThis worked for me on Fedora\n\nA: I had same problem.\nDespite suggestion from manual, left mouse button selection for copying text does not work for me.\nI had found that middle mouse button does the trick.\n\nA: I've copied from the PuTTY manual: \n\nPuTTY's copy and paste works entirely with the mouse. In order to copy text to the clipboard, you just click the left mouse button in the terminal window, and drag to select text. When you let go of the button, the text is automatically copied to the clipboard. You do not need to press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Ins; in fact, if you do press Ctrl-C, PuTTY will send a Ctrl-C character down your session to the server where it will probably cause a process to be interrupted.\n\n\nA: Simple; just highlight the text in putty and right click. Note, though, that this will also paste the text into whatever you are working on in Putty.\nFor example, if you are copying text from Vim or Nano, highlight the text you want to copy, right click it, and then quit without saving. \n\nA: COPY:\nSimply highlight text in PuTTY. Press and keep pressed left mouse button + move mouse to highlight the text you want + release left mouse button and text will be copied to the clipboard.\nPASTE:\nJust click the middle mouse button to paste clipboard text in PuTTY itself or every other application that has a text prompt. Please note that modern mice don't have the middle 'button' but usually a wheel, so you have to click on the wheel. If you are using a laptop, tapping on the upper right corner of the touchpad (or on some models, pressing both buttons simultaneously) should reproduce a mouse middle click.\n\nA: You can use cat Abc.java to show the content of file.\nThen highlight the text and CTRL + C to copy the text.\nAfter that, you can paste any where you want.\n\nA: There is an ugly way that I use to copy from Putty console.\nIn Putty configuration window, I have enabled Session Logging to get the console output dumped to a file on my system.\n\nThen I tail the log file in a local terminal with command:\ntail -f <logFileName>\n\nWhen I have to copy something, I go to the local terminal where the log is being tailed and copy what I need with CtrlShiftC.\n\nA: just highlight the text on the terminal and click both right and left buttons on your touch pad simultaneously. \ngo to the text document and click the both buttons simultaneously for copying the details from terminal to text document.\nthis is what worked for me ..im on ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\nA: I have this same issue when working remotely using X, where I can't copy/paste from the remote putty window, which is displaying on my workstation, to local applications, e.g. copying a cisco configuration to a local text editor.

I looked in synaptic for efs support, but I couldn’t find anything.\nhere is an article about efs:\nhttp://www.linux.org/threads/extent-file-system-efs.4447/\nWhat commands can i use to repair an EFS partition?\n# fsck /dev/sdb1\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\next2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block\nfsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\nfsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb1\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4\nfilesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4\nfilesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\nis corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>\n or\n    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>\n\n\nA: The Linux fsck utility is basically just a front-end for filesystem-specific filesystem check utilities such as fsck.ext2 (aka e2fsck) and fsck.xfs (which actually does nothing; to check XFS, you must use xfs_check, and to repair it, you must use xfs_repair).\nIf you really mean EFS, then that's pretty exotic. I just checked the kernel configuration utility, and it reports:\n\nEFS is an older file system used for non-ISO9660 CD-ROMs and hard\n  disk partitions by SGI's IRIX operating system (IRIX 6.0 and newer\n  uses the XFS file system for hard disk partitions however).\nThis implementation only offers read-only access\n\nI found no matches to EFS in packages in Synaptic. Between the fact that EFS is an obscure read-only filesystem in Linux and the fact that there seems to be no package that might hold an fsck.efs utility, my guess is that either you're not remembering correctly that it used to be possible or you had an extremely rare and non-standard fsck.efs utility installed on a computer at some time. Of course, an old IRIX should be able to check the disk.\nIt's also possible that your disk isn't actually EFS, but the newer XFS. In this case, you'd need to install the xfsprogs utility to get the xfs_check and xfs_repair utilities.\nMore broadly, I have to question the need for an EFS check utility in an OS that provides read-only access to the filesystem. The only chance you'd have to write to such a filesystem would be in IRIX, and it should have a suitable check utility. Without the ability to write to the filesystem from Linux, in theory you shouldn't be able to damage it in Linux, except by blundering about with dd or something. If you're stuck with an old EFS disk, it's probably best to transfer its files to a more modern filesystem. If the point of the question is that you have such a disk and it won't mount, then perhaps you could use TestDisk to pull individual files off of it. That's likely to be a painful process, but short of dusting off an old IRIX system, it might be your best bet. Some further context about your problem might help us offer other solutions.\n", "Q: How do I check the flow of internet through ubuntu?

It's a nifty application and doesn't eat a whole lot of resources. I actually leave a terminal with it open, pretty much all the time.\nHere's a screen shot of it currently running on my system:\n\nHere is the Ubuntu official page about this for the 15.10 page, if you'd like some more information.\nIf you'd like to give Slurm a try then this can be done by simply opening up the terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T and type sudo apt-get install slurm and press ENTER. \nNote: You will have to enter your password, when you enter your password there will be no indicator on the screen, no asterisks, and the cursor will not move. This is normal behavior. After entering your password press ENTER again and follow any additional instructions given.\nAfter the installation process you can run slurm from the terminal (it's the only way to run it) by simply entering in the commands. This will vary per system and you can find out how your to use slurm by entering in the following command into the terminal:\nslurm -help\n\nAnd pressing ENTER. To give an example, I would (and did) type the following:\nslurm -i eth0\n\nThis is an example of the Slurm help file, as it stands with the current version. \n\nkgiii@kgiii-desktop:~$ slurm -help \nslurm 0.4.3 -\n  https://github.com/mattthias/slurm\nusage: slurm [-hHz] [-csl] [-d delay] [-t theme] -i interface\n-h            print help\n-z            zero counters at startup\n-d delay      delay between refreshs in seconds (1 < delay < 300)\n-c            old classic/combined view\n-s            split window mode with stats\n-l            large split window mode\n-L            enable TX/RX 'leds'\n-i interface  select network interface\n-t theme      select a theme\n\n\nIf you do not know and would like to find the names of your network devices then you can, again, use the terminal. Simple enter this:\nifconfig -a\n\nAnd, again, press ENTER.\nNow that you've successfully discovered the name of your favorite (in use) ethernet adapter, your output command will look something like the example given above. Just change eth0 for the adapter name of your choice.

I have rebooted the machine a couple times with no issue. \nNow, according the information at the aforementioned page, I need to \"fix grub\". I only know that grub is a kind of multiboot program. I don't know why I need to fix it. My machine now boots fine. Also, when I follow the instructions to fix grub, I encounter some issues. \nDuring the install, I placed / in the free space in dev/sda. I then made a partition for swap space in dev/sda. I left EFI alone as per the instructions, although I don't know why it was necessary - there are other instructions for the same install that don't say to keep EFI. \nNow for the first step in \"Fixing Grub\", it says to mount the hard drive which Ubuntu was installed on. I think I can skip this since I deleted everything except what was in dev/sda (?).\nIn step 2 when I enter the command \"sudo mount --bind /sys [path] /sys\" bash returns \"mount: special device sysfs does not exist\".\nWhat will installing Grub do for me? And how might one install it in this situation? \nAlso, why was keeping EFI necessary? \nThanks! \n\nA: The page you reference seems to describe a single-boot (Ubuntu-only, no OS X) installation. If that's what you've done and if your computer boots into the installed Ubuntu, then you're done.\nThe GRUB \"fixing\" instructions seem to be geared toward adding the nomodeset parameter to the kernel options. This parameter is required on some computers, but not on all of them. In particular, the page was written for a 2013 Mac Pro, but yours is a 2011 model, so they almost certainly differ in important ways, quite possibly including their need for nomodeset.\nFurthermore, the page describes setting up both rEFInd and GRUB. Either one alone is sufficient. If you see the rEFInd menu when you boot and select an option that boots a Linux kernel (with a name that includes the string vmlinuz, as shown when you highlight the option in rEFInd), then you're not even booting via GRUB. If you don't see the rEFInd screen, then chances are you are booting via GRUB. You're booting through both of them if you see the rEFInd screen and select an option that boots GRUB (with a name that includes the string grub).\nFinally, your question refers to \"keeping EFI.\" The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is a type of firmware -- software that's built into a chip on the computer's motherboard. EFI controls the way the computer starts and provides services to help OSes boot. As such, you must keep the EFI. (Well, you could replace it with Coreboot or something else, but that's a task for uber-geeks. It would also effectively turn your Mac into a non-Mac.) It's not clear to me what you're thinking of when you refer to \"keeping EFI,\" unless perhaps you mean rEFInd. If that's the case, then you need to figure out whether you're booting via rEFInd, GRUB, or both. You could remove one, but there's very little advantage to doing so.\n", "Q: GParted showing incorrect used space guys,\nI've been trying to search a solution for this all over Google, but my effects was of no avail.

GParted can't read \"inside\" an LVM partition, so it's feeding you misleading information. You don't say why you want to resize your storage space, so I can't be sure how you should do the job. There are two broad possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the space within Ubuntu -- If you want to juggle files around for use within Ubuntu (or even another Linux distribution), then you just need to shrink your current logical volume and create a new one, as described in this question and answers.\n\n*Using the space outside of Ubuntu -- If you want to clear room for installing another OS or to use the space from another OS that's installed to another disk, then the task is harder, since you must shrink not just the logical volume within the LVM, but also the physical volume (partition) that holds the LVM, as described in this question and answers.\nMore broadly speaking, you may want to consult this wiki page on LVM, which presents background information that you may find helpful.\n", "Q: Problem with installation of LaTeXDraw!

Sometimes part of image is located in a separate linux-image-extra package.\nLinux headers are needed to compile additional kernel modules for a specific kernel. Additional modules may be some drivers, virtualbox, etc.\nMeta packages are for automated kernel upgrades. E.g linux-image-generic points to the latest available linux image.\nlinux-generic points to linux-image-generic and linux-headers-generic.\nFor Ubuntu LTS versions there are multiple meta packages pointing to different major kernel versions.\nFor 14.04:\nlinux-generic downloads kernel 3.13\nlinux-generic-lts-utopic -> 3.16\nlinux-generic-lts-vivid -> 3.19\nUbuntu boots always with the latest kernel image unless it is intentionally changed in grub settings.

I would like to know if there is a way to roll-back shell commands : for example rolling back a rm -rf command.\n\nA: In general, a shell command could do anything to the system, and there is no omnipotent undo mechanism within Ubuntu.\nHowever, if you run Ubuntu as a guest inside a virtual machine, you could take a snapshot of the virtual machine, which would give you the ability to rollback to the snapshot.\n\nA: There is no way to \"roll back\" shell commands.\nIf you removed a file using rm command, you can only try to restore it using testdisk or a similar software.\nSome of shell commands can be rolled back by other shell commands.\nFor example, if file.txt did not exist, command\necho \"bla bla bla\" > file.txt\n\ncan be rolled back by\nrm file.txt\n\nIf file.txt had some content, the first command can't be rolled back.\nSo you need to be very careful using shell commands!\n", "Q: How to change the username and password for nagios site access on config files This explains how to configure username and password during initial configuration:\nHow do I install nagios?\nHow can I change that using config files on server if I've lost the username and password?\n\nA: I found the answer\nsudo htpasswd -c /etc/nagios3/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin\n\nEnter a strong password when prompted. \nNote the -c replaces all existing passwords.

This makes it easy for a script to capture\n    the output of a program that behaves differently\n    when its stdout is not a tty.\n\n\nThe usage of scriptinside your script makes no sense because script forks the shell or starts a new shell.\n\nIf the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by script will be that shell.

(Most shells set this variable automatically).\n\n\nA: if you normally run your script with foo.sh, try running it (assuming it's a bash script) with bash -x foo.sh.

I have following data set in text files:\nfile1.txt\na1:b1\na2:b2\na3:b3\na4:b4\na5:b5\n\nfile2.txt\nb2:c1\nb4:c2\nb5:c3\n\nHow to merge these values to make output file like this:\noutput.txt\na2:c1\na4:c2\na5:c3\n\n\nA: Since your files appear to contain sorted data, you should be able to use the join command e.g.\njoin -12 -21 -t: -o1.1,2.2 file1.txt file2.txt > output.txt\n\nThen\ncat output.txt\na2:c1\na4:c2\na5:c3\n\nSee man join for details of the options.\nIf the files are not pre-sorted, then you can sort them first using process substitution. Note however that the sort must be on the field on which you want to join the files e.g.\njoin -12 -21 -t: -o1.1,2.2 <(sort -t: -k2,2 file1.txt) <(sort -k1,1 file2.txt)\nandrogynous:hu2nt\ngra7vel:fi6nal\ncosm4etic:citizen\n\nThe result will also be in sorted order: if you don't want that, then there is a fairly standard way to do this kind of thing in awk using an array e.g.\nawk -F: 'NR==FNR {a[$2]=$1; next;} ($1 in a) {print a[$1]\":\"$2;}' file1.txt file2.txt\n\n\nA: Here's an awk approach:\nawk -F: '(NR==FNR){a[$2]=$1; next}($1 in a){print a[$1]\":\"$2};' file1 file2 > out\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*awk -F: Run awk, setting the field separator to :. This will read each input line and split it on :. So, for the first line of file1, the 1st field ($1) is a1 and the second ($2) is b1.\n\n*(NR==FNR){} : If NR is equal to FNR. NR is the current input line number and FNR is the line number of the current file. The two will be equal only while the 1st file is being read. \n\n*a[$2]=$1; next : save the second field as a key in array a whose value is the 1st field. Then, skip to the next line. \n\n*($1 in a){print a[$1]\":\"$2} : this will execute only while reading the second file. If the first field of the second file is a key array a, print the value for that key (the 2nd field of the corresponding line from file1).\n\n\n\nAnd a Perl one:\nperl -F: -lanE '$k{$F[0]} ? say \"$k{$F[0]}:$F[1]\" : ($k{$F[1]}=$F[0]);' file1 file2 > out\n\nOr, if you prefer:\nperl -F: -lanE '$k{$F[0]} and say \"$k{$F[0]}:$F[1]\" or ($k{$F[1]}=$F[0]);' file1 file2 \n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*perl -F: -lanE : The -n means \"read each input file line by line and apply the script given by -E to each of them\" . -E, like -e, lets you pass a script on the command line. The difference is that -E enables some extra features such as say. The -a enables automatic splitting of each input line on the character given by -F. Together, they make perl act much like awk. Fields are split into array @F and the 1st field is $F[0], the 2nd $F[1] etc. Finally, -l strips newline (\\n) characters from the end of each line. \n\n*$k{$F[0]} ? foo : bar: If the variable $k{$F[0]} is defined, do foo, else do bar. \n\n*($k{$F[1]}=$F[0]) : this happens if $k{$F[0]} is not defined (it is the \"bar\", above). It will save the second field as a key in the hash %k whose value is the 1st field. \n\n*say \"$k{$F[0]}:$F[1]\" : this will run if $k{$F[0]} is defined (the \"foo\" above), so if the 1st field of the current line was a 2nd field in another line. If it was, print (say is like print but adds a newline) the 1st field of the current and the value associated with it in the hash.\n\n", "Q: phone not recognized in ubuntu 12.04 Samsung GT-E1200i not recognized in Ubuntu 12.o4 using usb cable and I can find the drivers any where how can I get drivers\n\nA: I don't have 50 rep yet, so I can't comment, but I wanted to say that i happen to have the same problem. lsusb shows the following output:\n\nnoah@DellLaptop:~$ lsusb Bus 001 Device 005: ID 04e8:6860 Samsung\n  Electronics Co., Ltd Galaxy (MTP) Bus 001 Device 002: ID 4971:cb01\n  SimpleTech SP-U25/120G Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux\n  Foundation 2.0 root hub Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux\n  Foundation 1.1 root hub Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux\n  Foundation 1.1 root hub Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux\n  Foundation 1.1 root hub noah@DellLaptop:~$\n\nI am using Lubuntu 15.10, and PCManFM recognizes the device right away but I can't read or write to the device in MTP mode, and in PTP mode it isn't recognized at all.

Following advice I upgraded my kernel to 3.19-25 which overcame my problem. Shortly afterwards version 3.13-61 was released (kudos to those involved for their speed – “everyone has problems, the important thing is the way they are dealt with”), that too cures my problem. I am currently running 2.19-25 but I am also getting upgrades in the 3.13 series.\nGiven that my main requirement is for a system as stable as possible, am I better to stay with 3.19 or revert to 3.13?\nFurther, I assume I will keep getting upgrades to both the 32.13 and 3.19 series. How do I stop the “unwanted” ones being downloaded? (I'm relatively new to this game, please be as explicit as possible.)\nThanks for any help\n\nA: To stop installing 3.13 upgrades you can run in terminal\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nYou can also install Synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nand remove linux image and headers packages of version 3.13, that may not be removed at the previous step.\n", "Q: Hyper-V Ubuntu initramfs on reboot On the virtual machine when I update grub (sudo update-grub) and restart I get the BusyBox initramfs shell on boot.\nI have a checkpoint on the machine so I can easily go back to just before I ran the command and reboot to regain access to the fully booted machine.\nOrdinarily I wouldn't really care because I could just not update grub. However, I want to increase the resolution on the machine and this requires running that command and rebooting. Which as stated, kills the installation.\nThe os is Ubuntu 15.04, 64 bit. \nThis is the output when I run the command.

When I was using Linux Mint 17, I had no issues with using a modifier.\nIn Ubuntu, it lets me set the combo (the preference window properly shows Shift+Calculator or Ctrl+Calculator). But if I press the combo, my action never runs. If I remove the modifiers and use only the Calculator button, the action runs correctly.\nIs this a bug, or is there something else that is preventing a {modifier}+Calculator from running my script? Perhaps something else in unity is capturing the shortcut?\nEdit. It is only blocking a {modifier}+Calculator combo. {modifier}+Break, for example, works to run my script. The Calculator key seems to be the only one I can find that has this problem with a modifier.\nEdit 2. Clarification: the  Calculator button I am referring to is an actual button on my keyboard, just like  Vol+, ▶ Play,  Search, etc. I am not trying to load the gnome calculator at all.\n\nA: If you know the command to open the calculator, you should set the keyboard shortcut in compiz. \nYou should probably not use the generic method offered by unity as this method is unreliable and the compiz method is very reliable.\nFirst, install ccsm:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nNow, press ALT + F2 type ccsm and then press ENTER.\nEnable the \"commands\" plugin and then click on the \"commands\" plugin to set the settings.\nIn the category for \"command line 0\" type the custom command.\nClick on the \"key bindings\" tab and on the row for \"run command 0\", click where it says \"disabled\" to set the keys you want to use to run your custom command. \nClick the box for \"enabled\" on the popup window that appears.

But dd has the ability to write things outside of partitions, presumably in the MBR. How does it do that?\n\nA: In Linux, partition device nodes (/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb4, etc.) restrict access to the specified partition; but the whole-disk devices (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.) enable access to the entire disk. Partitioning tools (fdisk, gdisk, GParted, etc.) all work on whole-disk devices, and depending on the partition table type and contents, may write to just about any sector on the disk. The dd utility, if applied to a whole-disk device, may read from and write to any sector on the disk, too, by using the seek, skip, bs, and count options. (See the dd man page for details.)\nNote that the MBR is not special in this discussion, except insofar as it's the sector where the MBR partition table is stored. In the context of whole-disk devices, the MBR is simply the first sector on the disk. As such, if you read or write a whole-disk device using dd, the MBR will be the first sector read or written (assuming no use of the seek or skip options). The whole-disk devices give access to all sectors of the disk, though, not just the MBR.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with dd. Devices are exposed by the kernel. From that you could do whatever you want with them given you have the necessary permission.\ndd just use them to do its thing.\n", "Q: How to run Gnome Startup Applications in i3? i3 does not launch Ubuntu's startup applications by default.

Compare the output of both commands. You'll notice the second attempt produces a little more output and this is your hard drive. Then you can mount it using the mount command like:mount /dev/sdx /media/mount. /dev/sdx is the station designation you figured out using the commands above and /media/mount is the mount point you've to create first where you want fo connect your harddrive to in order to be able to access it.\n", "Q: Signing up for Ubuntu One In the Ubuntu One sign-up process, when it gets to the Captcha entry, the phrase \"type these above\" blocks the letters to be typed so I can't type them correctly. \n\nA: The Ubuntu One service has been discontinued for some time, and is no longer available for use.

One of the machine has 2 NICs with one connecting to the internet and the other connecting to a switch. The remaining 7 machines all have only 1 NIC each connected to the same switch. My questions are as follow:\n1) If I install MAAS on the machine with 2 NICs, would it help me making the remaining 7 as a part of MAAS cluster? If yes, please advise how I should setup the IP addresses and all.\n2) If by using the above method, I make all nodes a part of the same cluster, how would I be able to deploy an openstack cloud on the whole cluster? My minimum requirement is setting up an openstack cloud that allows the creation of any type of instance and uses all 8 nodes.\n3) If the above 2 points are possible, how would I be able to define a particular node to be controller,compute,network,object storage, block storage node. I mean, once all nodes are a part if the same cluster, would I have to maually define a node to be any of the node mentioned above or will MAAS do this automatically?\n4) Last, do I have to setup MAAS from the starting setup (similar to installing UBUNTU SERVER), or is it possible if I already have UBUNTU SERVER installed on a machine and I can install MAAS on it making it the controller node of the cluster.\nI hope I am giving an idea about what I would like to do.\n\nA: 1) It depends on whether you need that cluster to be open to the world.  If that is the case, you can either make the switch your \"uplink\" (plug you r outside network into the switch), or you can set up the MAAS server as a proxy for the other machines.  The simplest way to only connect your maas server to the outside world and make it a proxy for the internal network.

You can either then configure them by hand, or use juju to do the provisioning with various \"charms\" - I think there are a few threads, if you do a search with maas, juju and openstack.\n3) If you use juju, you are able to define the requirements for the machines that run each of your services,  You can also force a charm to deploy to a particular machine.\n4) You can start from a loaded ubuntu machine, server or desktop (I've done both).  The MAAS server machine is not run very hard, other than when it is pushing the OS out across the network, which only happens when you allocate a machine to a juju service (if you are using juju).\n", "Q: ubuntu no longer starting in secure mode I had a working dual boot system, Kubuntu 15.04 and Windows 8.1 - after an update 3-4 weeks ago, Ubuntu wont boot when secure mode is enabled.

I've seen this problem on my ASUS P8H77-I motherboard. Basically, take two signed binaries (say, shim1.efi and shim2.efi), both of which are recognized as properly signed by another motherboard. On my ASUS, just one of those binaries may be recognized as valid; the other may be rejected. Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating. I don't know for certain if it's a bug in the firmware or if there's something wrong in the way the binaries are built or signed and that some EFIs are letting bad signatures past. I've not yet seen the problem with binaries built with the TianoCore EDK2 toolkit, but I have seen it with binaries built with GNU-EFI. (To the best of my knowledge, Shim is always built with GNU-EFI.)\nIn any event, if this is the problem, the solution is to revert to a known-working Shim binary. If you don't have a copy of your old Shim, try this one:\nhttp://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/shim-signed/\nIt's old, but it's proven to be reliable for me. If you use it, you'll probably have to register Ubuntu's key via MokManager. The key is available in an Ubuntu package, but I don't recall which one offhand. I've collected a bunch of keys in my rEFInd project; you can download them piecemeal here:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/refind/code/ci/master/tree/keys/\nYou'll need the canonical-uefi-ca.der file to boot Ubuntu's version of GRUB.\nIf you try replacing your Shim, I recommend you back up your old one and the associated MokManager binary and then copy the new one and its associated MokManager binary over the original filenames. (This may involve renaming shimx64.efi to shim.efi or vice-versa.) Ordinarily, an Ubuntu installation's Shim will be in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/.\nAll this said, it's conceivable that something else is wrong, especially if you're certain your system hasn't upgraded Shim recently. An unsigned GRUB might be to blame, for instance.\n", "Q: 14.04 kate editor does not show any plugins (wrong config permission even after fresh install) I got a strange problem with kate editor.\nFor some reason, whenever I runs kate in normal mode (without sudo) then all kate plugins disappear. I could not see any Projects/FileSystemBrowser/Documents that I normally use.\nBut when I run kate with sudo then those plugins show up, albeit the look-and-feel looks odd (with all the borders, etc.).\nI tried to uninstall and reinstall kate altogether, but the problem still persists. It looks like I have two different kate installed, the look-and-feel looks different as well when running with/without sudo.\nOh and before I can just type kate <document_name> and it would show up nicely in a new tab. Now it doesn't work that way, opening a whole new windows instead (not new tab).\nAny suggestion to fix this issue would be appreciated - thanks.\n\nEdit 1:\nI have two Ubuntu 14.04 machines, and this happens with just one machine. Ironically it happens with the machine that I use most of the time (not with the secondary machine). Could it be the kate config is different somehow, or if the config is corrupted?\n\nEdit 2:\nI can't recall exactly when the problem happens. But certainly sometimes after upgrading Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.

They in fact look very different. As a first step, I backed up the config folder in the machine that doesn't work, then copy the one from the other machine over. And now kate seems to work ok. I'm monitoring it now.\nObviously this doesn't look like a proper fix yet, but at least it appears working for now.\nWhat still baffles me is why that config folder has all those wrong permissions, even after a fresh install. Anyway that should not be in the scope of this Q - as long as kate works stably with all those plugins - that's all I need.\n\nA: You should not run kate with sudo, that leads to such issues. Instead, use kdesu kate.\nNow, assuming that some permissions in your home directory got messed up, use this command to find all files in your home directory that are not owned by you (sudo is added in case you have a directory that is inaccessible by your user due to insufficient permissions, $USER is normally expanded by the shell to the current user):\nsudo find ~ ! -user $USER -ls\n\nYou can then manually sudo chown $USER: your-file or fix it immediately while running find (be careful not to have typos in this command):\nsudo find ~ ! -user $USER -ls -exec chown $USER: {} \\;\n\nNote the : after $USER, it results in chown changing the group of the file to the primary group of user $USER (which is typically, but not always, the same).\n\nA: You could try reinstall Kate from the terminal:\n  sudo apt-get install --reinstall Kate\n\nand the reconfigure Kate:\n  sudo dpkg-reconfigure Kate\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: How does Click/Snappy solve dependency issues? There is a bit of confusion surrounding click and snappy. \nFor one, I understand that there are certain packages that are not allowed to be shared due to app-armor. For example, if I write a Qt application that executes a python script, app armor will prevent me from using the installed python interpreter on my own system. My program however does depend on a python interpreter.\nHow would Click/Snappy solve this and other dependency issues? \n\nA: In a snap package, you can simply have two parts: one being your Qt app, the second one being the python script. Parts in snaps are handled by plugins and they make sure everything gets installed in the right place and have what they need. For example could your Qt app be built using the cmake plugin and your python script using the python3 plugin.\nIn short: you bundle what you need and what's not provided by the OS. This may change and be expanded in the future.\nFind out more here: https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy/build-apps/\n", "Q: SSL3_GET_RECORD:decryption failed or bad record mac On my up-to-date 15.04 VV Ubuntu boxes, I tried to download some VMs.\nwget -c https://az412801.vo.msecnd.net/vhd/VMBuild_20141027/VirtualBox/IE8/Linux/IE8.Win7.For.Linux.VirtualBox.zip\n--2015-07-31 09:43:28--  https://az412801.vo.msecnd.net/vhd/VMBuild_20141027/VirtualBox/IE8/Linux/IE8.Win7.For.Linux.VirtualBox.zip\nResolving az412801.vo.msecnd.net (az412801.vo.msecnd.net)... 192.229.145.200, 2606:2800:10c:249:f81:1c8d:1178:1364\nConnecting to az412801.vo.msecnd.net (az412801.vo.msecnd.net)|192.229.145.200|:443... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 206 Partial Content\nLength: 3985616237 (3.7G), 3971559386 (3.7G) remaining [application/x-zip-compressed]\nSaving to: 'IE8.Win7.For.Linux.VirtualBox.zip’\n\nIE8.Win7.For.Linux.   0%[                      ]  14.03M  1.29MB/s   in 0.5s   \n\n2015-07-31 09:43:29 (1.29 MB/s) - Read error at byte 14712199/3985616237 (error:1408F119:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:decryption failed or bad record mac).

In the past it used to store private data, passwords obviously, but as of nowadays you'd need to be more worried about /etc/shadow - most Linux systems nowadays use shadow suite of utilities to keep a hashed and salted password in /etc/shadow, which unlike /etc/passwd isn't world-readable.  (unless you use pwunconv command, which actually moves the hashed passwords back into `/etc/passwd).\nThe only more or less sensitive piece of info is the usernames. If you have sshd or telnet on the server and a username with weak password, there is a potential for a brute force attack.\nBy the way, your very same question has been asked before. Here I merely restated some of the concepts mentioned there already.\nSmall addition: this is a little far-fetched, but I've noticed that you have bash as root shell. Now, suppose you have a user on the system that has bash as their shell, even worse - that user is sudoer. Now, if you bash is outdated or unpatched, an attacker could try to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability to steal data or execute a fork-bomb bring your system down temporarily. So yes, technically /etc/passwd isn't a big deal, but it does give an attacker an idea of some of the information on what to attempt\nAdditional edit, 11/18/2016\nHaving used an Ubuntu server on Digital Ocean for a while, it came to my attention, that most brute force attacks against my server were carried out for root user -  99% of the entries for failed password in /var/log/auth.log were for root. /etc/password, as I mentioned before, gives attacker look at the list of users, and not just system users, but human users as well, which means more potential venues for attack. Let's remember that not all users are security conscious and don't always create strong password, so an attacker's bet on human error or overconfidence has quite a high probability of being jackpot.\n\nA: In order to log on to a machine you need to know both the user name and password.\n/etc/passwd provides information on users which gives you half of the information you need and used to include a hash of your password.\nA hash being something calculated from your password.  It is difficult to find a password from a hash but not the other way round.  If you have both you can try brute force attempts to find the password offline then only try to connect to the computer once you have found it.\nToday security is improved because the hashes are stored in a different file /etc/shadow which by default is not readable by most users.\nBut, if I had access to both /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow I could probably find your password using a brute force 'dictionary' attack.  Since I can do this locally on my machine you would not notice many failed attempts to find your password and I would only need to connect to your machine again once I knew the password.  I am then free to do whatever I want.\nThere is more information here on Wikipedia\n", "Q: Facing problem in dual boot of Ubuntu 14.04 with window 8.1 on my leptop of lenovo G500 BIOS based I buy a laptop of Lenovo G500(4GB ram, 500GB HDD and quick heal total security licence antivirus) of BIOS mode.

Could this have to do with KDE?\n\nA: \nCould this have to do with KDE?\n\nQuite possibly, although my first guess would be Ubuntu's general habit of replacing normal GTK+ UI with custom — and very, very broken — code. Case in point: the global menu, which was broken for YEARS for perfectly valid wxGTK code (affecting Audacity, Poedit and others) because they don't care much about compatibility. In 14.04, this code finally got relatively stable, but some issues remain.

The GitLab CI runner created a new user, gitlab-runner, which executes all the tests. Now these tests include GUI components, so I need an X display - which I force on even without a physical display via the ConnectedMonitor and CustomEDID options in the xorg.conf.\nThe problem is that when a test is started by the user gitlab-runner via DISPLAY=:0.0 ./runTestApp, I get a \"Could not connect to display :0.0\" error. I can fix it by logging in as a regular user on the workstation and run sudo DISPLAY=:0.0 xhost +.\nHowever:\n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't found a way to successfully automatically run xhost + on startup (tried putting it in /etc/rc.local)\n\n*The man page says that xhost + is actually very insecure, but I haven't found out what to do instead. It feels like it might have to do with an .Xauthority file (which my regular user has, but gitlab-runner doesn't)\n\n\nWhat's the best way to give gitlab-runner permanent access to the X display?\n\nA: First, to give access only to the Gitlab CI runner, you need to use a more restricted command:\nxhost +SI:localuser:gitlab-runner\n\nSecond, /etc/rc.local runs way too early for this command to have effect, and further, you need to set $DISPLAY for it to work.\nIt depends on how your X server is being started. If you're using LightDM, I think you can make it work by adding the following line to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:\ngreeter-setup-script=xhost +SI:localuser:gitlab-runner\n\n\nA: If you do a ps alxww|grep X you should see that your X server is running\nwith the option -auth followed by some filename. This file holds a random number called the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.  Only X11 clients that can present this\nnumber to the X11 server in the protocol startup are allowed to connect. \nApps run by the same user who started the server will find the cookie value in the ~/.Xauthority file, which is normally not readable by others.\nYou can either remove the -auth option from the launch of the server, by looking in the config of whatever xdm, gdm etc startup mechanism you use,\nor you can copy the cookie from the login user to your other user, or you can give them read access to the .Xauthority file.\nEg to copy the cookie, as user pholz:\nxauth list :0 >/tmp/toadd\nchmod a+r /tmp/toadd\n\nand as user gitlab-runner:\nxauth add $(</tmp/toadd)\n\nOr to allow read access:\nchmod a+r /home/pholz/.Xauthority\nchmod a+rx /home/pholz/\n\nand then in the gitlab-runner environment set:\nexport XAUTHORITY=/home/pholz/.Xauthority\n\n\nOf course, if you dont really need a display, you can launch a separate\nX11 server which displays into memory, and is completely independent\nof any user login and screen.  You need only do:\nsudo apt-get install xvfb\nXvfb :1 -noreset &\nexport DISPLAY=:1\n\nThen all your apps will display into this virtual framebuffer.

Will it still work? I already have 500 MB of unallocated free space which I can use for /boot. Then why should I use the live disk? Can't I do everything from my current Ubtunu installation?\nThis is what I understand. /boot partition can't be shared between operating systems. Since I require /boot for my Arch, I should copy the contents of /boot from Arch to the newly created /boot from Ubuntu. Now I can reboot to Arch. Then I should change the fstab of arch to mount the new /boot. Then I install GRUB on the /boot partition from Arch. Should I make any changes to Ubuntu's fstab? Will this break Ubuntu?\nIf what intend to do is wrong, how do I do this?\n\nA: You can not create more that 4 primary partitions in MBR.\nI suggest temporarily removing /sda3 swap partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move left side of /sda4 right.\n\n*Remove /sda3.\n\n*Create an extended partition in unallocated space.\n\n*Create two partitions inside the extended.\n\n*Format one as swap, the other as ext2 for /boot.\n\n*Update /etc/fstab with new UUIDs and mount points for swap and /boot.\nYou will have to update /etc/fstab in both Arch and Ubuntu to mount the new partition as /boot and also copy there contents of both boot directories.\nYou will also need to re-install grub after that.\nThese operations can be done while booted from Ubuntu LiveUSB.\nBut it will be much easier to have two separate /boot partitions for each OS.\nAnd also ext3 is not a good choice for /boot. I would recommend ext2.\next3 is similar to ext4 but obsolete. ext2 does not have journal, it works faster. Journal is not that important for /boot.\nSo there is not reason to use ext3.

Is it possible?\n\nA: From Wubi Guide:\n\nWubi is an officially supported installer for Windows XP, Vista and 7\n  only.

I've checked and secure boot is still disabled.\nLog from boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11972534/\nSo what's next?\n\nUpdate: I've attempted to use chroot to update grub from my Ubuntu partition. update-grub runs successfully finding both linux and windows boot manager but the process still doesn't have any effect. grub-install complains that it cannot find EFI directory (but I have mounted everything correctly).\n\nUpdate2: Just discovered that running efibootmgr after chroot into ubuntu shows ubuntu as not being in the boot order at all. I manually changed the order and rebooted to discover that the bootorder was reset. I run in windows: bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi But this has no effect either even after reporting 'Operation Successful'.\n\nA: same problem here, upgrading from windows7 to 10 in a dual boot pc...\nI resolved in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade Windows\n\n*During installation process, after the first reboot, i get the grub rescue prompt, fixed this with BootRepair in a USB stick\n\n*Completed the Windows installation, GRUB has gone and with a live cd of gparted i noticed that all partitions was still there but all of them were NTFS\n\n*Used TestDisk from windows recovered my Linux partition\n\n*BootRepair again and everything seems ok (i've Windows voice in GRUB menu duplicated.. i don't know why, but everything seems ok to me now!)\n\n\nI hope it can be useful to someone!\n\nA: My wife's machine is older (non-UEFI) and had Ubuntu installed on a logical extended partition. Upgrading to Windows 10 first killed grub so reboots resulted in the \"grub rescue\" prompt, which I restored with BootRepair from LiveUSB, but my Linux partition was missing! I restored this with parted rescue from LiveUSB, which found and recovered the partition. From there, I mounted the partition from LiveUSB and did a grub-install and was able to boot back into the recovered Ubuntu and Win10. Hope this helps others.\n\n\n*\n\n*By LiveUSB I mean the USB drive I used to install Ubuntu (see http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu). You can also use a bootable CD. Once you boot from this device, you should be able to find the BootRepair and gparted apps on it.\n\n\nA: The only solution that worked for me is described on that link\nI've brought it again here just because it's easier to find this thread on google.\nEssentially the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Ubuntu Live to boot in 'Try Ubuntu' mode.\n\n*Use GParted to verify the correct linux partition (e.g. /dev/sda2).\n\n*Mount the linux partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with your partition number\n\n\n*Mount all other linux system folders :\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\nIf you are running an UEFI system, you will also have to mount your EFI directory using the following command:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi\n\n\n*chroot into your install\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n\n*Now that you are logged in your installation (not the Ubuntu Live) just do \nupdate-grub\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub\nexit\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd that's it !\nCredits go do Scott Severance on the link I've mentioned above.\n\nA: Have you checked the order of your boot sequence?  If the Microsoft boot loader is at number 2, move it to the bottom and reboot.\nYou can check it from within Ubuntu by running sudo efibootmgr -v in terminal.\n\nA: We have a number of answers here providing steps on how they fixed the issue (Loss of Grub menu due to latest Win10 update). Various answers proves the solution isn't unique as the machine configs ain't unique. \nFor my system (Acer E5-575G-57D4), following is the fix:\nShort answer:\n1) In Windows, as mentioned by Nicholas in his answer, enter the following command as administrator in Windows command prompt.\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n2) Run boot-repair utility with Live Ubuntu CD/USB.\nLong answer:\n1) Log in to Windows. \n2) Create a bootable USB stick (with your Ubuntu version) and plug it in.\n3) Enter this command as administrator in command prompt:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nRestart.\n4) While it boots press F12 to see the boot menu. Select \"Linux\". Note: For this, \"F12 boot menu\" must be enabled in the BIOS settings (Press F2 while booting). \n5) In the menu, select \"Try ubuntu without installing\", for Live Ubuntu session.\n6) Connect to your WiFi. Download and run boot-repair using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nJust follow the prompts, till you get the message that the grub is fixed. It worked for me.\nThanks :)\n\nA: I just had to run this in Windows as an administrator:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nOr, if you are using PowerShell:\nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nGRUB appears fine on boot and I can boot into Ubuntu and Windows 10 fine.\n\nAs pointed out in the comments (by David Faure), the final argument to this command depends on your particular system configuration. You can use this command to determine the correct path for your system:\nbcdedit /enum firmware\n\nThis will list all the installed boot managers and associated EFI paths, and grub should be somewhere in the list.\nNote:  This works without live USB's, but you might need to boot into BIOS and turn off secure boot.  This can stop the above from working.\n\nA: I am not sure that is related but I also ran into a bit of an issue trying to upgrade to windows 10 from a windows 8.1/debian dual boot.\nBasically, at some point in the upgrade, I ended up with grub going into rescue mode because my debian partition had been wiped in the process and hence the boot files with it (I generally have a separate boot partition but not this time ...). From a look at this link: Windows 10 upgrade led to grub rescue\nI think the problem is that windows did not write the partition table correctly during the upgrade process.\nAnyhow, I fixed the problem by booting on a Win8.1 install external hdd and followed those instructions: https://neosmart.net/wiki/fix-mbr/ (scroll down to win8/8.1). That wiped grub and reinstalled mSoft's boot loader. I then managed to finish the upgrade and reinstalled debian all together since at the time I had not realised it was simply a problem with the partition table not being written correctly. Yet a better solution would be to try and recover your partition table (using testdisk?) and then reinstall/update grub.\nHope that helps.\nPS: Thank you microsoft for not giving a damn about people who have a dual boot configuration ...\n\nA: I used the rescuetux/supergrubdisk.  Booted it from DriveDroid on my android tablet.  Then used auto detect rescuetux.  Went into the WINDOWS button, hit the betaWindowsMBR repair button.  And selected /dev/sda2 ok ok ok. Then it said successful.  Now i just booted back into windows uefi menu. \n\nA: My fix was close to @Francesco but a bit different.\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade Windows from 7 - 10.\n\n*During installation process, after the first reboot, i get the grub rescue prompt, fixed this with BootRepair in a USB stick.\n\n*Grub now appears, but is only showing Ubuntu partition, not Windows.\n\n*Log into Ubuntu, go to terminal and type update-grub\n\n*Now Windows shows back up in grub menu, continue with Windows 10 upgrade.\n\n\nA: If you have a Win10 installation media you may use this to install a new fresh MBR. Just boot intil you see \"Install now\" (or similar) but do not click on it. There is a small link saying \"repair tools\" (or something). From this you may enter command prompt.\ncd c:\\windows\\system32\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nmaybe even\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nThis should fix the issue. But, Your Linux is longe gone due to Microsofts ignorance to peoples own choices. They have just decided that it is okay for them to delete whatever is available on your HDD and which they do not like. Therefor we may legally decide that MS is a bunch of dorks...\nWin10 installation media creator tool is freely available from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\n\nA: In my case, there is no path likes  \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi when running bcdedit /enum firmware. It is \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi. Run the following command in Administrator mode of cmd:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\nIt worked for me.\nDual boot Windows 10 (1909) and Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: 8/8/15 I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10,  and after Windows10 installed I made Firefox my default browser and shut down my PC, waited 15 seconds and powered up the PC and didn't even expect that it would give me an option to still choose Ubuntu within 5 seconds.I clicked Ubuntu and it seemed to hang in limbo with a grey screen for what seemed an eternity , but I didn't do anything except tapped the enter button on the keyboard to attempt get something to happen and waited , then finally the familiar black screen to choose Ubuntu or advanced options appeared. It booted up in Ubuntu fine. After I shut off and powered up in windows 10, the time and date in Windows showed 5 hours fast, just like windows 7 did after using Ubuntu, LOL. Next time I chose Ubuntu to boot the boot up wait was a lot shorter.\n\nA: For me the process was quite complicated. I use boot repair form the usb stick, and after I remove the usb stick and restart the computer only ubuntu login option came. I log into Ubuntu which was installed in my computer hard disk and then use boot repair again. After that when I restart my computer now I have the options to login into both Unbunt and winsows 10 and it's working just fine.\n\nA: After upgrading to Windows 10 on Acer Aspire-AXC-605, I could not boot into ubuntu and F2 key would not bring up bios screen so could not boot from USB ubuntu live.\nI had to use Esc key while booting this brought up a \"Diagnose PC\" screen and I could boot USB from there.\n", "Q: No linux-tools for stable kernel release I can't install and use perf tool on my linux server:\nLinux vzu01-ubuntu 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:43:14 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nroot@vzu01-ubuntu:~# apt-get install linux-tools\nReading package lists...

If a person has physical access, and your PC is running, they can at the very least access the decrypted data from memory.\nIf the PC is turned off, they will need your passphrase to access the data, this can of course be bruteforced etc. \nI don't see how changing your password in the shadow file and logging in would reveal the passphrase.

When I try to open it a window comes up that says \"Windows cannot open this file\" Not sure where to go from here. This is my first experience trying to do this. \n\nA: Kubuntu is an operating system not a windows executable file.  In order to run Kubuntu, you need to burn the ISO to a CD, DVD or flash drive and boot from that device.\nKubuntu ISO is a Live CD so you can boot your computer to it and not harm or affect your Windows system. It will allow you to use Kubuntu until you get used to it, or when you are comfortable, you can install it on your HDD, or a separate HDD right next to Windows XP.  Then you can choose to boot on XP or Kubuntu.\nAn alternative is to install a Virtual Machine (VM) program and run Kubuntu in the VM while running XP.  Virtual Box is a great tool for that.  However, it will run slower and use up a lot of your resources operating inside XP.  \nEither way, you can work with Kubuntu and get to know it before installing it or without removing or damaging XP. \n", "Q: How to set keyboard switch with Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3 etc In windows in keyboard switch settings there is an option that you can switch keyboard language with unique combination for each one.\nFor example, Ctrl + 1 - for english, Ctrl + 2 - for russian, Ctrl + 3 for ukrainian etc. \nIt would be super handy, if there is an option to set this thing in Ubuntu. \nAre there any options? \n\nA: You can do this using setxkbmap.

I need to edit some directives in my SSL config for Apache. The direct way would be to edit /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.conf. \nCould my changes be overwritten by a package update? Would it be better to add a new file, say zzz-myssl.conf which contains my overrides and enable that?\n\nA: If you definitely want changes to be effective for all applications you're running now and and at all times you can imagine, edit the existing files in /etc/apache2/mods-available/, otherwise modularize as early as possible by separating into different files.\nThe latter case should almost always be the way to go as you'll figure out much later that you can reuse a configuration and write it in a shared file (one that is included in the main configuration or one that you include in multiple files) in most of the cases. That's what files are for.\nIf you stick to the default locations (/etc/apache2/mods-available/ is one) dpkg would warn you if changes would be overwritten, yet it's more comfortable to not be warned at all and leave package maintained things be package maintained things and your files your files.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Security?

As it should be.\nEven the most \"secure\" passwords you could set (the BIOS password asked during boot and before any device is accessed) can be circumvented: all motherboards have known default passwords that grant access to the system or using a simple screwdriver, the CMOS battery can be removed or the NVRAM chip can be swapped out.\n", "Q: using wget to download xml for conky script won't keep html tags So I'm trying to setup a conkyrc for weather, using the following script: \n#!/bin/bash\n\nstation=\"KRAP.xml\"\nwdir='/tmp/weather'\n\nupdate_xml() {\n          if [ ! -e \"$station\" ];

I have a video with text that I am trying to translate into other language, I will not place the translation as subtitles, the idea is to use the same font and place the translated text in the same place as the original text is.\nThe software that I need is a software that either let me do the previous (i.e. remove the text within the video) or that allows me to convert video frames to images (that I'd be able to edit with GIMP) and backwards (i.e. images to video) AND in both cases the software should allow me to introduce text in any coordinates of the video with any font I desire.\nThe software should also be able to \"remove\" any object from a video like Adobe After Effects as shown in this tutorial.\nImportant note:\nThis question is not a duplicate of Ubuntu is there any frame by frame video editor software which can allow to place a picture? as this question asks for a different goal that was solved differently in the link provided.\n\nA: With Avidemux (available from the Software Centre) you can: \n\n\n*\n\n*Export frames as images - navigate to the frame you wish to convert and the then follow File > Save > Save JPEG image.\n\n*Build a video from a series of images - name the files as 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg,  0003.jpg, etc and then open the first file.\n\nA: In order to have a frame by frame sequence of a video, the more elegant solution is to export all the sequence of frames once for all, instead of specific frames one by one.\nIn that case, the use of the ffmpeg package is required, as well as to convert the image sequence back to video.\nFFmpeg installation\nIn order to install ffmpeg the ppa should be added first.

The changes to /etc/default/grub persist between all reboots.\nAny ideas/advice/insight on how to ensure audio device remains present after booting in ubuntu after booting into windows 10?\n\nA: i just recently ran into troubles using kali on the x360 4005 ubuntu ran fine with just secure boot off but for kali i had to make sure it was in legacy mode and i had to choose the EFI boot after that from the USB the ubuntu dvd worked fine but kali gave a nothing but black on the dvd i had to use a usb stick for that after you enable secure boot off you have to enable legacy mode on but your grub should have been loaded off the ubuntu media and should say ubuntu at the end of it...and that should always have the ubuntu selection and windows boot in the grub selection...i would say make sure your ubuntu grub install is in your media and its up to date which on 15 it should be...if you see the splash menu on startup with media in it should be the same splash with the media out once you install..otherwise you might have a broken install maybe recompile the media and retry...\n", "Q: Getting started with iPython notebook Please don't consider this a duplicate.  I have seen a similar post and the recommended solution has not solved my issue.  I need input for I can't find a solution elsewhere and iPython does not seem to have a support forum.\nI am trying to use iPython notebook on Kubuntu 14.04 but can not get it to launch.  I found this post and tried the recommended solution of installing dependencies. The system states that python-pip and python-dev are already the newest version.  There is no response for build-essential.\nIf one uses pip to install a python package, does it make a difference which Python interpreter is launched?  Troubleshooting this issue I discovered Python 2.7.6 & 3.4.0 are installed on my system.  Would that make a difference?  From my reading of the requirements, iPython should work on either version of Python.\nIn research to find a solution I came across ipython notebook --notebook-dir='<path/to/notebooks>'. I set the variable to a path under my home directory.  That did not make a difference.  If it try to start by entering ipython notebook I get the following Tracebacks:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/ipython\", line 11, in <module>\n    sys.exit(start_ipython())\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/__init__.py\", line 120, in start_ipython\n    return launch_new_instance(argv=argv, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 573, in launch_instance\n    app.initialize(argv)\n  File \"<string>\", line 2, in initialize\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 75, in catch_config_error\n    return method(app, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/terminal/ipapp.py\", line 321, in initialize\n    super(TerminalIPythonApp, self).initialize(argv)\n  File \"<string>\", line 2, in initialize\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 75, in catch_config_error\n    return method(app, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/core/application.py\", line 369, in initialize\n    self.parse_command_line(argv)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/terminal/ipapp.py\", line 316, in parse_command_line\n    return super(TerminalIPythonApp, self).parse_command_line(argv)\n  File \"<string>\", line 2, in parse_command_line\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 75, in catch_config_error\n    return method(app, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 471, in parse_command_line\n    return self.initialize_subcommand(subc, subargv)\n  File \"<string>\", line 2, in initialize_subcommand\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 75, in catch_config_error\n    return method(app, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/config/application.py\", line 402, in initialize_subcommand\n    subapp = import_item(subapp)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/utils/importstring.py\", line 42, in import_item\n    module = __import__(package, fromlist=[obj])\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/html/notebookapp.py\", line 30, in <module>\n    check_for_zmq('13', 'IPython.html')\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/utils/zmqrelated.py\", line 12, in check_for_zmq\n    raise ImportError(\"%s requires pyzmq >= %s\"%(required_by, minimum_version))\nImportError: IPython.html requires pyzmq >= 13\n\nAdditional questions \nAfter Steve Barnes  advice I am not sure everything working as it should.  For iPython to work, I had to create the directory for notebooks under the root of all other websites on my machine.\nEntering ipython notebook in a command prompt I get the following output:\n16:33:11 Fri Jul 31 - ~/www/ipython_notebooks\n$> ipython notebook\n[I 16:33:15.571 NotebookApp] Using MathJax from CDN: https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js\n[I 16:33:15.588 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/daniel/www/ipython_notebooks\n[I 16:33:15.588 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels \n[I 16:33:15.589 NotebookApp] The IPython Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/\n[I 16:33:15.589 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\n[W 16:33:16.801 NotebookApp] 405 HEAD /tree (127.0.0.1) 5.74ms referer=None\n\nIn my browser the url is unexpected.

Any links or dropdowns don't work.\nTo get the web page to work as expected it is necessary to type the url http://localhost:8888/notebooks/ explicitly. The page rendered next is unexpected either for Jupyter and not iPython.\nI would like to include screenshots but apparently I don't have sufficient reputation to do so.  I feel there is something I am missing.  Can someone offer if they have had a similar result and how to fix it?\n\nA: The last line tells what your problem is:\nImportError: IPython.html requires pyzmq >= 13\n\nYour system either has no pyzmq or an old version - try:\nsudo pip install -U pyzmq\n\nThe -U is the same as --upgrade and will request the installation of the latest version of pyzmq that is compatible with your version of python.\nYou may have to install some other dependencies to get this to work such as the python-dev package that matches your current version of python, which will need to be installed with apt-get install.\nThere may well be additional unmet and optional dependencies of iPython and its notebook for you to meet, for the majority sudo pip install -U name_of_component will do the trick. I would also suggest reading up on python virtual-env \nSome more notes\nOnce iPython is running in notebook mode you will need browse to localhost:8888http://tree or //localhost:8888/tree as is shown by the last line in the command window, note that /tree is a view type not an actual directory and any notebooks and sub-directories in directory that you started iPython from will be shown.\nYou may also be confused to see that the server is now called jupyter this is because the notebook functionality from iPython has grown into, and is now being maintained and developed as, a separate project that supports Python 2/3, Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby and many other languages. \nOne server can open kernels running any of them that you have installed on your machine as well as you being able to mix some of them in a single notebook by using the magic commands.\n", "Q: Unwanted startup page on Firefox keeps on coming back I recently watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5La0XhLIaY\nAnd now every time I open my browser, it is one of my startup pages (although not replacing any of the existing), I have looked in my settings and it is not marked as a startup page. I have also been experiencing other similar issues, such as when I have multiple tabs open and I click the close button, and I don't get it asking me if I want to close all the tabs, it just closes, and launches them all back up again as they were next time I open my browser, I even have a problem where sometimes I go to a site, it is the only tab, I close my browser, the next day when I boot my machine up, and start my browser, it goes to where I left off when I last closed my browser instead of opening my startup pages. These issues come and go though and are likely to just be bugs, however almost every time I start up my browser, it starts the video I stated above, and although it is nice at first, that video really does get a little annoying...\nSo really that is my question, how can I get Firefox to startup and not have that video as an additional startup page? And why I am I experiencing these very similar issues any way? Bug? Or something else?\nIf it helps, I am on Ubuntu Gnome 15.04, with Gnome Shell, and Gnome 3.14.\nFirefox Plugins and Extensions:\n\n\nFor those of you who do not want to go to the video at least until you have seen what awaits you there:\n\n\nInformation Update:\nI have tried purging and reinstalling Firefox as well as deleting everything in ~/.mozilla/firefox.\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\nPackage Information:\nfirefox:\n  Installed: 39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Candidate: 39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.15.04.1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     37.0+build2-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid/main amd64 Packages\n\n\nA: Sounds like a session problem.

Mojang recommends using Oracle's JRE, but I see people using OpenJDK all the time.  What are the advantages and disadvantages to using one or the other on Ubuntu, either in general or specifically as it relates to Minecraft?\n\nA: The official advice is that you should use Oracle Java, since that's what Minecraft's developed against. However OpenJDK is pretty much equivalent in functionality so you can use OpenJDK for Minecraft. \nIf you run into problems however, try switching to Oracle Java.\n\nA: Maybe in 2015, when the question was asked, Minecraft was unplayable in OpenJDK, but today (in early 2020) I play Minecraft weekly using Ubuntu 18.04 and OpenJDK 8 (right now version 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3~18.04) without any issue. Umm, maybe in windowed mode sometimes I lose mouse and/or keyboard response, but in fullscreen the gameplay is smooth.\nThe main difference is in the distribution license:\n\n*\n\n*Oracle JDK was licensed under Oracle Binary Code License Agreement.\n\n*OpenJDK has GNU GPLv2 (the GNU General Public License).\n\nThe use and distribution of Oracle Java is restricted by its license, so Ubuntu can't ship it in their distribution. In the other hand, OpenJDK is completely open source and can be distributed, used and modified freely.\nYou can install Oracle Java manually in Ubuntu 18.04, but you need to update it. OpenJDK is installed from the official Ubuntu repositories and is kept up-to-date by its maintainers with security patches up to date.\nAbout performance, there is some enhancements in Oracle Java.

I have been trying to set up my apache server for many days now, to no avail. I have acquired a DynDNS Pro account and have also registered a domain name with names.co.uk (I haven't even figured out what to do with that yet, and if I even need it at all).\nI've configured my sites-enabled folder in the /etc/apache2 directory to point to the directory where I have my .html documents. It works fine when I have DynDNS set up to the local IP Address 192.168.x.x. But I know that this means that other people can't access my website. When I go to the DynDNS website and change the IP address to what is my public IP, if I try to access my website \"shredalert.homelinux.com\" it takes me to the login page for my router. I am completely boggled as to why this occurs. This is my first time trying to set up a web server and website. Please have some patience if I make really silly comments/assumptions.\nI should add that I have already forwarded port 80 for 192.168.x.x. How would I fix my apache server to load my website, instead of loading my router login page when I change my IP to my public IP address on DynDNS?\nP.S. Would very much appreciate if someone who uses \"names.co.uk\" could tell me how I could utilise the domain name I have registered.\n\nA: A few notes :\n\n\n*\n\n*your domain's configured dns servers must point to dyndns\n\n*your router must forward port 80 to your local machine. The ip address on your local machine should be static and ideally reserved on the router.\n\n*your machine must have port 80 open\n\n*if all this is setup correctly, if you do http://externalIp you should get your default apache page (same as http://localhost)\n\n*you must set a virtualhost for shredalert.homelinux.com to listen, or put that domain as alias of localhost with ServerAlias shredalert.homelinux.com directive on your main config file.\n\n\nCreate the virtualhost file /etc/apache2/sites-available/shredalert.homelinux.com.conf like :\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName shredalert.homelinux.com\n    DocumentRoot /path/to/root/directory\n    ErrorLog \"/var/log/apache2/error.shredalert.homelinux.com.log\"\n    CustomLog \"/var/log/apache2/access.shredalert.homelinux.com.log\" common\n\n    <Directory /path/to/root/directory>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nThen enable the site and restart (or reload) apache2 service\nsudo a2ensite shredalert.homelinux.com.conf\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nNote : you can change /path/to/root/directory to anything you want, so not necessarily you must expose your complete localhost root dir.\n", "Q: L2TP/IPSec VPN Connection On OS X, there's an option for L2TP/IPSec VPN in network connections where it lets you enter an IP Address, Username, Password, and Shared Secret.\nI downloaded Strongswan in Ubuntu, but do not see any place to put a Shared Secret, Username, or Password.

Same machine.\nIf boot with Windows 7, outlook.com loads, any browser, I use Firefox most of the time.\nIf boot with Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits), outlook.com does not load, blank page, no error messages, all browsers including Google Chrome and Chromium. If boot a guest OS under Virtual Box (Windows XP SP3) the guest OS even being Windows does not load outlook.com, all browsers including IE 8.\nIn both platforms I'm able to see the login page. It renders fine. But once I input the username and password, in Linux I end with a blank page.\nI have also a PC with Windows 8, It loads outlook.com without any problem. I have another Linux PC (Lubuntu 14.10) that I have not tried yet, but I suspects it behavior will be the same than my main PC with Ubuntu.\nIt is confirmed then that something in Linux is preventing the connection to outlook.com or any of its resources, scripts, etc. I had no messed up with any config file like the host file or something. In case this is relevant, both Linux and Windows 7 have a static IP set for the LAN, but not the same, Windows 7 ends with 3, and Linux ends with 4, even if it is the same machine. Both Linux and Windows have the DNS servers addresses manually set, and both use the same DNS servers.\nUsing the Network monitoring in Firefox Developer Tools I can only see two urls trying to load, they are:\nhttps://mail.live.com/\nhttps://col125.mail.live.com/default.aspx\nFirst one returns code 302.\nSecond one never returns. The loading of the outlook.com web client stops there under Linux.\nIf I copy and paste second url into browser's address bar, I end with a page that says \"Failed secure connection\" and asks me to send a report of the problem to Mozilla, I did it.\nDon't ask me to clean history, I cannot do that. But I created another profile using Firefox Profile Manager that has a clean history and no addons, and behavior of outlook.com is the same there. I think the problem is in the OS not in the browser. I don't know which component may be causing this. My Ubuntu 14.04 has all updates to date.\nUpdate:\nI confirm that Lubuntu 14.10 does the same. Other thing I may try is with a different router, but I cannot do it right now.\nConfigure the account in Mozilla Thunderbird works. Both as IMAP or POP3, so that is what I'm doing while the web client get fixed. Just add your credentials and select IMAP and let Thunderbird auto configure everything.\nBefore somebody suggests it, I already tried with the MTU in the router config page. All values I tried (1500, 1492, random number, back to default) worked under Windows and none under Linux.\nThe problem is that many people occasionally ask me to use outlook.com in this computer for different reasons and configure Thunderbird each time is not practical. For an occasional read of e-mail a private window with the web client is the most practical. I open to any suggestions.

I think I have found a cause for the famous BLACK SCREEN on Ubuntu 14.04, and I hope to find a solution for this problem here.\nI am struggling with a black screen issue on Ubuntu 14.04. \nMy desktop has multiple operating systems running, each one installed on a different HDD.\nMy desktop runs Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7.\nBoth Ubuntu 12.04  and Windows 7 run with no problem, but Ubuntu 14.04 presents from time to time a black screen. If sound is running in the time of event, the sound continues to run, only the screen image is missing. \nOn Ubuntu 14.04 (and only on that OS) the black screen can appear a minute after the system is on and going, or after an hour, or after two hours, or the system can run a day or two with no problems at all! Only to present that black screen again three days later. And that is more confusing for me.\nI have google searched and entered in numerous threads about this BLACK SCREEN issue (this is why I sayd  the famous BLACK SCREEN on Ubuntu 14.04), but with no success. \nThe graphic card is an old ASUS EAH 3870X2 (AMD ATI) with two graphic processors.\nIt has no more support for drivers on Linux from the manufacturer (and I will never ever again buy AMD ATI products).\nHowever, somewhere on the big www somebody said something about the BLACK SCREEN issue on a laptop that he had just purchased, showing the black screen problem. He tested the GPU temperature with the command sensors in Terminal. The temperatures presented there were way too high. That guy finally returned the laptop in the 30 days time he had for no matter what return. And that was all.\nFollowing that path I tested my Ubuntu 14.04 with the sensors command in Terminal on Ubuntu 14.04, and to my stupefaction the result shown was a + 115 C for one GPU processor, and a + 91 C for the second GPU processor!!!!!!!!!!!\nAnd that with almost no video activity at all, only the OS running a fresh boot and the Terminal on (of course).\nI have rebooted on Ubuntu 12.04 to seek for temperature results. Here I could place in terminal the command: \naticonfig --  odgt \nand the result was: \nDefault Adapter ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2\nSensor 0: Temperature 56 C.\nThen I rebooted on Windows 7, and the results obtained from HWINFO64 were somewhere on the same range, 53 C on one GPU, and 52 C on the second GPU.\nIs it possible that Ubuntu 14.04 operating system is killing the graphic card output if the temperature is too high?\nIf it does, then why the GPU temperature on 14.04 is listed so high?\nMy graphic card cannot reach + 115 C on a fresh boot with no activity at all!!!! And it does not, because on Ubuntu 12.04 and w7 the temperature shows temperatures somewhere around 56 C.\nSo, what is happeninng on Ubuntu 14.04 with GPU Temperature sensors?\nWhat is the solution for this problem? Possiby this problem affects many others who are struggling with this BLACK SCREEN issue. Many of them have this problem even from trying to boot a live Ubuntu  DVD that leads them only to a black screen. Even the installation of this OS is compromised.\nLater Edit:\nToday I have tried a few more tests regarding GPU temperatures on different operating systems on my  desktop, and the black screen phenomen.\nFirst, I booted on Windows 7 and opened HWiNFO64.\nI looked at the temperatures of the GPU (fresh boot, no hard video load, only HWiNFO64 sensors running):\nGPU Thermal Diode 51 C\nGPU Thermal Diode 49 C\nThen I have completely stopped one of the two coolig fans of the graphic card (the graphic card has two cooling fans, it is a big graphic card).\nI kept the cooler on hold for two minutes. The time was registered with a cronometer on my telephone.\nAfter two minutes the video on my monitor was still on and going strong. No problems at all.\nThe temperatures of the GPU after two minutes (one cooling fan blocked by me, only HWiNFO64 sensors running):\nGPU Thermal Diode 62 C\nGPU Thermal Diode 51 C\nI released the fan and let the cooler to run a few minutes to cool again the graphic card. \nAfter that I have stopped both cooling fans of the graphic card.\nAfter two minutes the video on my monitor was still on and going strong. No problems at all.\nThe temperatures of the GPU after two minutes (both cooling fans blocked by me, only HWiNFO64 sensors running):\nGPU Thermal Diode 73 C\nGPU Thermal Diode 68 C\nSo, on W7 the system was still going on after two minutes, with both cooling fans stopped.\nNext I did the same tests on Ubuntu 12.04 and on Ubuntu 14.04. Here, due the fact that the temperature was not displayed on continuosly, but the command must be entered on Terminal, I asked my wife to help me. She was quicly paste the command (aticonfig --  odgt on 12.04, respectively sensors on 14.04, copied previously) and then hitting Return, to obtain the results, while I was keeping the fans blocked and watching the time on the stopwatch.\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 the results were:\n With one of the two GPUs coolig fans stopped:\nThe system presented a black screen after 1 minute and 12 seconds.\nThe last temperature displayed on terminal was 55 C.\nWith both GPUs coolig fans stopped:\nThe system presented a black screen after 48 seconds.\nThe last temperature displayed on terminal was 58 C.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 the results were:\nThe temperatures with the system 14.04 fresh boot\nradeon-pci-0300 \nAdapter: PCI adapter \ntemp1:       +112.0°C  \nradeon-pci-0400 \nAdapter: PCI adapter \ntemp1:        +95.0°C  \nWith one of the two GPUs coolig fans stopped:\nThe system presented a black screen after 7 seconds.\nThe last temperatures displayed on terminal were\nradeon-pci-0300 \nAdapter: PCI adapter \ntemp1:       +122.0°C  \nradeon-pci-0400 \nAdapter: PCI adapter \ntemp1:        +97.0°C  \nWith both GPUs coolig fans stopped:\nThe system presented a black screen after 4 seconds.\nThe last temperature displayed on terminal were somewhere the same of the ones above (122 C).\nThen I have completed a cicle by running the tests again on w7. That in order to see if the computer has been getting or not warmer on the use, and leading to worst results on Ubuntu 14.04.\nBut again, the computer was still going on on W7 after two minutes of cooling fans blocked. The result were\nthe temperatures of the GPU after two minutes (one cooling fan blocked by me, no hard video load):\nGPU Thermal Diode 55 C\nGPU Thermal Diode 52 C\nthe temperatures of the GPU after two minutes (both cooling fans blocked by me, no hard video load):\nGPU Thermal Diode 71 C\nGPU Thermal Diode 73 C\nConclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*On windows 7 the system was still showing video content even after two minutes of both cooling fans blocked.\n\n*On Ubuntu 12.04 the system displayed a black screen after 1 minute and 12 seconds with one cooling fan blocked, and after 48 seconds with both cooling fans blocked.\n\n*On Ubuntu 14.04 the system displayed a black screen after 7 seconds with one cooling fan blocked, and after 4 seconds with both cooling fans blocked\nUbuntu 14.04 performs the worst of the three OSs.\nI am sure that my graphic card cooling system is good. \nThat is due to the fact that, even it is a 6 years old graphic card, I have recently (two months ago) cleaned it up. \nI have completely dismounted it, changed the thermal paste, changed the thermal pads, cleaned it up. \nIt runs with no problems on w7. \nI cannot even block the video display on w7, even with both coolers completely stopped. \nSomething is about the way that Ubuntu s  Temperature sensors read the values, and about how Ubuntu  takes the decision to kill the video output.\nEspecially on Ubuntu 14.04 this is a problem who affects many people. \nFor the moment I have added to my system two cooling fans to blow over the graphic card. One 100x100 mm fan, and a smaller one.\nStill I hope to find a better solution for this problem.\nBest regards.\n\nA: While I was looking for more informations about temperature sensors on Ubuntu, I found a page about lm-sensors on Ubuntu here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto\nThey say in that post that:\nAs you can see, some sensors are obviously incorrect (e.g. AUX Temp and Case/Aux Fan); this tends to be the case with at least some of the sensors on most motherboards. \nThe AUX Temp in the example that they mentioned was:\nAUX Temp:   +124.5°C  (high = +80.0°C, hyst = +75.0°C)  ALARM  sensor = thermistor\nSo, for Ubuntu OSs:\n\n\n*\n\n*sensors can detect obviously incorrect temperatures, as shown on that article about lm-sensors.\n\n*sensors can detect obviously incorrect GPU temperatures, as shown in my post above with a wrong + 115 C GPU temperature detected by 14.04 for my GPU.\n\n*Ubuntu can take the decision to kill the video output, as demonstrated by me by blocking one or both graphic card cooling fans, leading to a black screen monitor.\nYes, I am pretty sure that I have found one of the possible causes for the black screen Ubuntu!\n\nA: Now, armed with these informations that I gathered the last two or three days, I can see better the things that had happened with my computer on the last two months.\nAs I have told you previously, about two months ago I have serviced my 6 years old ASUS EAH 3870X2 Graphic Card, who was waiting that maintenance stored somewhere in a box in my house. My destop had another Graphic Card installed at that time. I have completely dismounted the ASUS EAH 3870X2, changed the thermal paste, changed the thermal pads, I cleaned everything up. After that, I have installed the  ASUS EAH 3870X2 Graphic Card on my desktop. \nDue to the fact that the motherboard (an ASUS P5E3 Premium) has two slots for Graphic Cards, I have decided to install the  ASUS EAH 3870X2 Graphic Card on the slot the closest to the bottom of the dektop case. \nI was thinking that the air close to the bottom of the case is the cool air, and the warm air is located higher inside the case. \nBut I can see now that that was a bad idea. \nThat because the space left between the graphic cards cooling fans, and the bottom of the desktop was very small, maybe 3 centimeters (a little more than one inch). \nI think that the warm air blown out by the GPU coolers was sucked back again by the same vents, and leading to a fast temperature rising. \nAt least high temperatures for the 14.04 sensors, because for 12.04 and w7 were running with no problems.\nWhat happened was that after this Graphic Card installation (in this position) I have been able to run Ubuntu 12.04 and windows 7 with no problems at all.\nWhen I was trying to run Ubuntu 14.04 the system booted, sometimes leading me to a black screen, and sometimes I get as fas as to to be able to see the desktop for maybe 20 seconds, and after that I was getting the black screen.\nI have had the Graphic Card mounted in this position for about 6 weeks. In those 6 weeks I have tried to solve this situation on Ubuntu 14.04. \nI have been able to enter in the OS with nomodeset, no black screen at all when running on nomodeset, but due to the fact that AMD ATI has stopped the support for this Graphic Card for 14.04, and I have had no drivers available to install, I was unable to work around and find a permanent solution. \nI was even thinking to reinstall 14.04 to get back my OS. But running the installation DVD took me to the famous black screen.\nI have even thought to install something else, so I tried to install Linux Mint, or Ubuntu Mate, but the installation DVD's all send me only to look at a black screen.\nAfter that, I  thought what about this situation is due to the fact that the Graphic Card is mounted in the wrong motherboard slot? \nIt is said that, if you have only one memory RAM stick available, it is best to insert it on the motherboard's RAM slot the closest to the processor.\nWhat if the same thing was also true for the Graphic Card?\nSo I took the Graphic Card, and mounted it on the other slot, the one closest to the processor. \nThat gave some more space below the Graphic Card, between the cooling fans and the bottom of the case. Now the free space is around 7,5 cm (about 3 inches).\nAfter that move, a miracle happened: my Ubuntu 14.04 was running again!!!!! \nIt was not perfect, as he had from time the the black screen issue, but it worked a lot better than before! \nIt run without the need of nomodeset. \nIt's true that I had the black screen issue from time to time, but at least it worked fine 98% of the time!\nThe fact that I still have the black screen issue every now and then was the reason that I have continued to search for possible causes. And that leaded me to make these tests and to post these observations here. \nHope that these observations help, and hope that someone will find solutions for the video black screen issues on Ubuntu.\n\nA: I think you've hit on a good solution.  I had a similar thing happen with Ubuntu 14.04, but on an Nvidia GeForce card (a 12 old one, but decent, even today).  This card continues to show high temps due to wear and tear from old age, but in Ubuntu it was worse.

And yes, this is not duplicate of this.\n\nA: I'm afraid you've accidentally deleted Windows from your computer. In your Boot Repair output, lines 57-61 show your partitions, which include an EFI System Partition (ESP) to hold your boot loaders (/dev/sda3), a 14GiB root (/) partition (/dev/sda1), a /home partition (/dev/sda4), and a swap partition (/dev/sda2). There are no Windows partitions among that list. Your ESP does include the Windows boot loader, but that's pretty much all that remains of Windows on your computer, aside from ghosts of former files. (See below for recovery tips.)\nThere is considerable free space on the disk -- your final partition ends at sector 95,688,703, but the disk has 976,773,168 sectors. Thus, there's a slim chance that you'll be able to recover your Windows partition(s) with TestDisk or a similar tool. I say \"slim chance\" because the usual way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows is to shrink the largest Windows partition from its end point, which puts Windows near the start of the disk and Ubuntu at the end or in the middle of the disk. That's not the pattern here, but if you moved and resized your Windows partition so that it started somewhere after sector 95,688,703, you might be able to recover it. It's worth a try.\nIf that fails, I hope you have good backups, since restoring your user files from backups is your best bet. If not, you'll need to use PhotoRec or something similar to recover your files one-by-one. (I've seen claims that third-party Windows-specific tools do a better job than PhotoRec on NTFS volumes, but I don't have pointers to specific tools. You might want to ask about this on a Windows forum.) Also, if you had important files on your system, stop using it immediately!! Every moment that Ubuntu is booted from that disk, it may be writing data to disk, possibly overwriting your old Windows data. Shut down and use an emergency disk for recovery.\nIf you don't care about personal files from your Windows installation, or after you recover then with PhotoRec or something similar, you can re-install Windows to the disk using emergency media. This page provides instructions on downloading various versions of Windows legally for situations like this.\nBefore you re-install Windows, though, consider resizing your Ubuntu partition; 14GiB is a bit small for Ubuntu. It's adequate if you don't install much extra software, but it may well run out. Unfortunately, since that partition is at the start of the disk, you'll need to move or resize others. The easiest way may be to delete your swap partition (/dev/sda2), expand /dev/sda1 into that space, and create a new swap partition later on the disk. This will require editing /etc/fstab to point to the new swap partition once you're done; failure to do so will mean that Ubuntu will not use the swap partition at all.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server GUI without internet I'm new to linux but I know about the startx command which is not working. I just installed Ubuntu Server (the newest version) on a old computer. I have it working but I am unable to launch the gui. I cannot connect to the internet because I don't have a network adapter. How would I start the gui?\n\nA: Ubuntu Server does not come with a GUI. Its Headless, IE: Command Line Only. You would need to run an APT-GET command which requires internet.\nIf you get network capabilities check out..\nInstall GUI on Ubuntu Server\n\nA: Even when @FreeSoftwareServers is true, there's a way to install a GUI, download a desktop version of ubuntu, i think xubuntu (xfce) is more suitable since it's an old computer (limited resources).

When I try to open the file, I have the following error message: \nNO MOUNTABLE FILE SYSTEM. \n\nWhat should I do to solve this problem? \n\nA: First in order to create a bootable USB on mac for Ubuntu you should follow these instructions I took from the Arch Wiki:\nTo be able to use dd on your USB device on a Mac you have to do some special maneuvers. First of all insert your usb device, OS X will automount it, and in Terminal.app run:\n    diskutil list\nFigure out what your USB device is called with mount or sudo dmesg | tail (e.g. /dev/disk1) and unmount the partitions on the device (i.e., /dev/disk1s1) while keeping the device proper (i.e., /dev/disk1):\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1\n\nNow we can continue in accordance with the instructions above (but, if you are using the OS X dd, use /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk, and use bs=1m. rdisk means \"raw disk\" and is much faster on OS X, and bs=1m indicates a 1 MB block size).\n# dd if=image.iso of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m\n\n20480+0 records in\n20480+0 records out\n167772160 bytes transferred in 220.016918 secs (762542 bytes/sec)\n\nIt is probably a good idea to eject your drive before physical removal at this point:\ndiskutil eject /dev/disk1\n\nAfter that install Refind as that should make booting into the USB installation of Ubuntu easy and then reboot your computer and select the USB.\n\nA: \nWhen I try to open the file\n\nThis is not an application or software installer and this is not how you install Ubuntu. You need to create a bootable medium, boot it, and then you can install Ubuntu. Macs with up to date firmware should behave like standard UEFI computers with Windows 8 or later, which means just follow the standard instructions. If they work, good for you, if not, follow karel's answer.\n\nA: It seems Ubuntu ISOs have some partition map shenanigans that make them unreadable using regular OS X tools. At least that's true for Ubuntu 15.10 and Mac OS X 10.8, but there are reports on the web regarding other versions too.\nThe only tool I was able to find that can successfully burn a Ubuntu ISO to USB is UNetbootin. Make sure to prepare the USB drive first with Disk Utility, choosing 1 Partition, GUID partition table (in the Options button) and MS-DOS FAT partition type.\nI have not tried the resulting USB on my Mac, but it installed cleanly on a Windows PC, while no other method worked, including dd in the Terminal.\n\nA: ISO or DMG should be created from a valid file system. For instance:\n$ diskutil list\n\n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 GB     disk3\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage FER_PEN                 3.7 GB     disk3s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk3s3\n/dev/disk4 (external, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS FER_PEN                +3.5 GB     disk4\n                                 Logical Volume on disk3s2\n                                 96D32D40-6F89-41A0-AA56-89D904A15295\n                                 Unlocked Encrypted\n\nThe only valid filesystem is Apple_HFS, thus I issue:\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk4 of=pen.dmg bs=1m\n\n", "Q: I'm having trouble starting Steam, could someone help?

How do I actually make them apply? The scenario below assumes we booted up the computer and logged in as the user bort at the login menu.  This is on 14.04.2.\nIf I open up a terminal, as the user bort I can list a dconf setting, for example\n$ dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode\n0\n\nIf I were to use dconf write to change the value to 1 the menu on the left side of the screen would be hidden\n$ dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\n$ dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode\n1\n\nNow the menu is hidden.

The menu will appear again.\nNow, if I was in one terminal as the user root and tried to use su bort -c to change the value for bort I CAN change it.  I know this because in another terminal where I'm the user bort, I can use dconf read and see that the value has changed to 1.  So the value has been changed BUT the menu on the left side of the screen is still visible.  How can I make the change actually apply instead of just being updated in the dconf database?

I know this sort of question has some answers on this site, such as using dbus-launch but this hasn't worked for me.  Maybe it's Ubuntu version specific?\n\nA: You don't have the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable set, so the changes don't stick. As your user, write down the output of\necho $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n\nand then in the root command use\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=xxxxx && dconf write ...\n\nwhich should work.\nAfter fighting their lame attempt at hiding their socket for a bit, one working solution to automatically get the address is to borrow it via a process environment:\n# requires a GUI session program that will always run:\np=`pgrep -u \\`whoami\\` gnome-panel`\n\nr=`grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$p/environ | sed 's/^[^=]*=//'`\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$r\n\nOf course you'd have to pick something other than gnome-panel if you're not running that.\nWorks for SSH_AUTH_SOCK as well.\nJust leaving this here so it may help people who have so far googled unsuccessfully (like me ;) ).\n\nA: On CentOS 8.3, the following works for updating dconf settings.\n$user is another user as per the title in the question above.\ndbus-run-session is the recommended way to start a dbus session in command line mode. There is no need to export any DBUS_SESSION variables like BUS_ADDRESS or PID.\n# start a new dbus session and execute the dconf command in bash shell\nsudo  -i -u ${user} bash <<-EOF\n   exec dbus-run-session -- bash -c 'dconf write /org/gnome/software/download-updates false'\nEOF\n\nTo learn more, read the manpage: man dbus-run-session and man dbus-launch\nI presume, this should work on Ubuntu (not tested)\n", "Q: Piggy back ubuntu desktop on my windows laptop wifi so the desktop can access the internet?

When you install Ubuntu,  it divides hard drive into chunks or partitions. So you would need to boot from USB or CD and delete Windows partition.  (why usb because it dangerous to operate on a running disk).\nOn Ubuntu partition you will have a thing called grub bootloader. That this is what actually helps you choose between windows or Ubuntu when you start the computer.  If you just delete windows from computer that thing may break. So you will need to install it differently.  For example , if my Ubuntu is on /dev/sda3, I need to move grub to /dev/sda.\nThat's about it.

Dual boot process. Ubuntu 15.04 I just tried to do a Dual Boot with my Windows 8 desktop computer by following instructions on YouTube.\nAt the start, I made a 200Gb partition from my 1TB hard drive. I booted Ubuntu 15.04 by using the USB technique.\nIn the video at 8:30, in the box, \"Device for Boot Installation\", I picked the Windows 8 selection instead of the 1TB Hard drive selection. It was a successful installation.\nI restarted my computer, the GRUB screen appears. When selecting Windows 8, it just keeps sending me right back to the GRUB screen.\nI need help trying to get to my Windows 8! I don't really care about the files in there, just a bunch of Steam Games but all that really matters to me is to be able to use Windows 8!\nI also ran Boot-Repair but somehow didn't let me. It said something about using a live-cd or Live-USB.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the boot loader (GRUB) installation instructions in that video are a bit confusing because the narrator keeps moving the mouse around and talking about Windows 8; but in a BIOS-mode installation (as in the video), GRUB must go on /dev/sda (the whole disk) or on an Ubuntu partition (/dev/sda6 in the video, but that might not work for reasons I won't get into). In fact, if you review the video, you'll see that after a lot of mouse wandering, the device selected was /dev/sda. Installing GRUB on the Windows partition, as you say you did, overwrites the Windows boot loader with GRUB, rendering Windows unbootable and producing the symptom you report.\nThe solution is a two-stage one:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must use a Windows recovery disk to restore Windows to bootability. With any luck this can be done without too much hassle, but you will need a Windows boot medium outside of the hard disk. (If you don't have one, you can download an emergency repair disk from somewhere on Microsoft's side, but I'm afraid I don't have a URL handy.) There's a slim chance that the GRUB installation will have damaged more than the Windows boot loader, in which case you'll be in for a much rougher repair. If that happens, I recommend posting to a Windows forum for help; or if you have backups of your personal files, re-install Windows from scratch and then restore your personal files. (If you can boot Ubuntu, you should be able to back up your personal files from Ubuntu. Be sure to back up to an external medium so it's not in danger of another accident!)\n\n*Once you restore Windows to bootability, Ubuntu will no longer boot. You can repair this using Boot Repair from an Ubuntu emergency disk. (The Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode should work fine.) Depending on how you do the repair, you may be asked about a location for GRUB. Be sure to install it to the MBR of the disk (/dev/sda, in all probability), not to any particular partition.\n\n\nA: If you have only installed grub once, NTFS keeps a backup of the partition boot sector. And you can use testdisk to restore the backup. \nWindows may not even see the NTFS partition as grub is in the partition boot \nsector.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootSectorFix\nYou want to get to this screen:\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step#NTFS_Boot_sector_recovery\nIf the backup partition boot sector (BS) is damaged, use testdisk to write a new NTFS BS - Rebuild BS. It will be the wrong type as XP, but then Windows repair tools will work to fix it.\n\nA: I had a similar outcome after replacing my ubuntu 14.04 with 15.04 and ended up doing a full reinstall which I documented in response to another question:\nInstall Ubuntu 15.04 alongside Windows 8.1. \nI think the core of my problem was the Ubuntu installer creating a hybrid partition table which windows doesn't like. I repaired this using gdisk which might save you from repeating all of the install process. But back up your data first just in case!\n", "Q: How to delete from an UbuntuListView? I'm trying to learn how to use an UbuntuListView. Items will be added at runtime, but for demo I just hardcoded them.\nWhat I need is a way of removing existing list items. Here's my code and a screenshot.\nimport QtQuick 2.4\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.2\n\nMainView {\n\n    width: units.gu(40)\n    height: units.gu(30)\n\n    ListModel {\n        id: listModel\n        ListElement {itemName: \"one\"}\n        ListElement {itemName: \"two\"}\n        ListElement {itemName: \"three\"}\n    }\n\n    UbuntuListView {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        model: listModel\n\n        delegate: ListItem {\n            id: listItem\n            Label {\n                text: itemName\n            }\n            leadingActions: ListItemActions {\n                actions: [\n                    Action {\n                        iconName: \"delete\"\n                        onTriggered: listItem.destroy()\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nI drag the second list item and slide it to the right. The delete option appears, but when I click it, I get the following error:\nMain.qml:29: Error: Invalid attempt to destroy() an indestructible object\n\nI followed the examples from the API docs.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nBy the way, I also need to remove the corresponding model item, but how do I do that?\n\nA: \nBy the way, I also need to remove the corresponding model item, but how do I do that?\n\nApparently this was the solution: I just deleted from the model, and the view updated itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*I added an ID to the listElements:\nListElement {itemId: 1; itemName: \"one\"}\n\n\n*In the action's onTriggered, I searched for the item and removed it from the model:\nonTriggered: {\n    for(var i = 0; i < listModel.count; i++) {\n        if(listModel.get(i).itemId === itemId) {\n            listModel.remove(i);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nActually, searching is not even necessary. According to the API docs for QtQuick.ListView:\n\nThe index is exposed as an accessible index property.\n\nSo it's possible to write just:\nonTriggered: {\n    listModel.remove(index);\n}\n\nSo I suppose the object was indestructible because it still had a corresponding item in the model - which makes perfect sense. But in this case... maybe the documentation is a bit misleading.\n", "Q: Bash script not running at startup from rc.local I have written a simple bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"hi\" > log\nexit 0\n\nmade it executable and its successfully running.\nI edited my rc.local to the following:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\n/home/katph/test.sh \n\nexit 0\n\nrc.local is executable:\n/$ ls -l /etc/rc.local\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 349 Aug  1 13:19 /etc/rc.local\n\nWhat's working:\n1.I directly put echo \"hi\" > /home/katph/log in rc.local, it works fine.Meaning rc.local runs at startup.\n2.If I manually run rc.local with the script, log file is created correctly.\nAny suggestion?

How can I solve this? Can someone help me with the issue?\n\nA: From my quick and incomplete search to solve this problem myself and wild inferences from your post, you are attempting to download the package from the package repository that may only have panel support for unity. To use it without panel support, you may need to manually create and edit the program's config files documented in the link here. I would suggest trying the shell extension found here if you were using Gnome Shell 3.12, but I think 15.04 uses Gnome shell 3.14, based on the fact that I am on a freshly installed Ubuntu Gnome 15.04.\nGood luck and have fun, we are on linux so tinker my friend.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 USB installation drive not recognized during boot(Dell Latitude D630) Ubuntu 14.04 USB flash drive isn't recognized during boot.\nI have had a bunch of hardware failures this week and I am down to a hybrid image laptop harddrive with mint 12 installed on it to boot as /media/cdrom but I can't add to the OS, and I have to reinitialize everything each boot. I'd like to get wine/playonlinux up as well as some drivers for a soundblaster xtigy and live externals, midi, and usb devices such as m-audio and akai devices for FLStudio\nI have downloaded unetbootin and Ubuntu 14.04, my hope is to install a new installation onto the harddrive with mint 12 on it, as I can't do a full install from the drive, so I figure if I make a usb flash of Ubuntu I can do an install of Ubuntu from the flash drive.\nI managed to install Ubuntu 14.04 desktop amd 64 with unetbootin - I partitioned a 4GB staples relay UFD (universal flash drive) with a fat32 partition it shows up as an EFI system parition after the .iso was installed by unet boot in -- I did flag the drive originally as a boot flag drive when I originally formatted it but after install the boot flag is no longer there (is this because it is an EFI partition?)  It shows up fine, but after booting, and I changed my boot configuration to boot USB first then Harddrive. I removed my mint drive so only the USB was in after the first failure that booted into mint, and with just the USB drive, nothing detects during boot.\nI am pretty darn certain the problem is boot related, in that the USB isn't being recognized as a boot device.\nIs this because EFI isn't supported on Ubuntu usb drives, only ubuntu cd drives?\nDo I need to install a usb version of ubuntu rather than desktop amd64? \nDo I need to alter the .ISO to install a different boot?\nNote I still have mint12 running off a separate drive but it is a pendrive install of a hybrid image, I think I might have grub running, could I just add the flashdrive to mint12s's grub so I can boot off it from grub rather than BIOS?\nNone the less I'd really like to get a persistent Linux going whether ubuntu or mint. \nWhat exactly do I need to do to get Ubuntu  running from the 4gb flash drive and recognized by the Dell Latitude d630?\n\nA: As the D630 is an older model I don't believe UEFI has anything to do with it. Double check system requirements here I would avoid unetbootin as in my experience success is rare. I've had excellent results using dd to duplicate the iso to a USB flash drive. The process to do so can be found in here. Basically you just connect the flash drive you wish to install the image to and insure it's not mounted then issue the commands which you will need to edit as explained below. DO NOT copy and paste. Read the entirety of the answer and insure you have the device name correct before proceeding.\nsudo dd if=YourUbuntuImageName.iso of=/dev/XdY\nsync\n\nWhere YourUbuntuImageName.iso is changed to the name of your Ubuntu iso image and /dev/XdY is changed to the device name of the flash drive you want the image duplicated onto. dd uses a default block size of 512 bytes which you don't have to change. If you want a progress report during the \"burn\" you can install dc3dd with sudo apt-get install dc3dd and substitute dc3dd for dd in the command. The output of mount and sudo fdisk -l can be useful in determining the device name. \nThis will result in a USB bootable installer for Ubuntu. Boot from it using BIOS (I believe the D630 will let you choose the device to boot from if You repeatedly tap F12, to get the boot options menu) having booted from the installer, install Ubuntu normally choosing as the target the flash drive you wish to install to.\nInstalling Ubuntu to a flash drive is no different from installing it to any other drive. Your BIOS determines which device is booted from. You can create your own \"persistence\" with normal partitioning methods if you want home on a separate partition but installing Ubuntu normally to a flash drive will result in persistence of settings and installed apps (just as installing to a hard drive would) anyway so it's not truly necessary. Here's where you make the changes on a Dell D630 to allow USB Boot.

Again, note that you will need to have sudo access for these commands so you don't need to worry about any user being able to reset the MySQL root password:\nsudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &\n\nNote: The ampersand (&) at the end of the command is required.\nLogin\nAll we need to do now is to log into MySQL and set the password.\nmysql -u root\n\nNote: No password is required at this stage as when we started MySQL we skipped the user privileges table.\nNext, instruct MySQL which database to use:\nuse mysql;\n\nReset Password\nEnter the new password for the root user as follows:\nupdate user set password=PASSWORD(\"mynewpassword\") where User='root';\n\nand finally, flush the privileges:\nflush privileges;\n\nRestart\nNow the password has been reset, we need to restart MySQL by logging out:\nquit\n\nand simply stopping and starting MySQL.\nOn Ubuntu and Debian:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\n\nA: When I used this command:\nupdate user set password=PASSWORD(\"mynewpassword\") where User='root';\n\nI have got the following error:\nERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'password' in 'field list'\n\nI have searched for some time, and I found that we have to use authentication_string in the place of password, so I think the command should be:\nupdate user set authentication_string=PASSWORD(\"mynewpassword\") where User='root';\n\nThe second command works for me perfectly. \n", "Q: apache2,php and mysql - facing problem in editing the files and loading them in browser friends, I have installed apache2 , php and mysql but now the problem is I don't know where to write the programs and put them back into the server folder so that I can access them back.My file i.e html and php file should be place in /var/www folder but when I try to create new document I'm not able to create it it's showing access denied. Please help me.... \n\nA: If you are not allowed access to a file, precede the command you are typing with sudo, this should prompt you for your password. The sudo command basically means \"superuser do\". So you have privileges of the root user when you use it. Example: sudo vi index.html. \nHope that sorts that part of the problem out for you.\n\nA: The easiest way is to add your user to the group that owns /var/www/, usually www-data\nCheck the group of /var/www\nls -la /var/ | grep www\n\nwhere the output will be something like \ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 ago  1 16:10 www\n\non my output the second www-data position indicates the group is actually www-data\nso now you have to add yourself to that group\nsudo usermod -a -G www-data yourUserName\n\nensure that users belong to www-data can write to that dir\nsudo chmod -R 0775 /var/www/\n\nLogout and login again to refresh permissions. Now you should be able to write with your user on that under that dir.\nNote : if the group is different from www-data, you should check which group is running apache and makes changes according to it\ngrep GROUP /etc/apache2/envvars \n\nThe output is something like this \nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\nTo change the ownership of /www/data use\nsudo chown -R useOwner:groupOwner /var/www/\n", "Q: combine audio and photo using command line in Ubuntu What is the best way that I can make a video from one photo and one audio file like Mp3\nI’m using an Ubuntu headless server, so I need a command line version for this...

I'll repeat my entire post here for completeness:\nI'm trying to get refind to boot the Lubuntu kernel directly instead of maintaining the manual config and using grub in between. For some reason though, refind only finds the grubx64.efi file (on the ESP), but never the kernel files (on Lubuntu's own partition). I have a virtualbox set up with refind and arch installed, where refind does find the arch kernel directly. Its configuration is the same so I don't know why detecting the kernel doesn't work on the real machine.\nUEFI, GPT disks, secure boot off.

Because it supports subvolumes, it's often necessary to specify unusual options to get rEFInd to scan the right subdirectory and to get the kernel to recognize the right location as its root.\nTo get rEFInd to scan the kernels, you must add the following line to refind.conf:\nalso_scan_dirs +,@/boot\n\nThis assumes that you do not have a separate /boot partition. (My guess is it would be +,@ if you have such a partition, but I've never tried that.) If this doesn't work, you could open an EFI shell and use it to try to find your kernels, then add whatever their location is in a similar way. This might not be necessary in Arch because Arch and Ubuntu might set up their Btrfs volumes in different ways.\nWith that change in place, rEFInd should detect your kernels, but attempting to boot them will fail. This problem can be overcome by making changes to your /boot/refind_linux.conf file. In particular, you must add the following to the boot options:\nrootflags=subvol=@\n\nBe sure to add that in addition to the normal root={whatever} and any other kernel options you use.\nAlso, be sure that the EFI driver for Btrfs is present in the rEFInd drivers or drivers_x64 subdirectory. I realize you mentioned that drivers are installed, but it wasn't 100% clear that you meant the EFI driver, so I want to make that explicit.\n", "Q: Python GTK3 keyboard accelerators I'm working on creating an application for Ubuntu using Python3 and Gtk3.\nI'm trying to add keyboard accelerators to the program but unfortunately I keep running into problems.\nThis is my code atm:\n#! /bin/python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk\n\nclass DeSedit(Gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"DeSedit\")\n\n        self.set_default_size(550, 350)\n\n        # FileChooserDialog - Open File\n        dialog = Gtk.FileChooserDialog(\"Select file to be opened\", self,\n            Gtk.FileChooserAction.OPEN,\n            (Gtk.STOCK_CANCEL, Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL,\n            Gtk.STOCK_OK, Gtk.ResponseType.OK))\n        # keyboard shortcuts\n        accel = Gtk.AccelGroup()\n        self.add_accel_group(accel)\n        self.add_accelerator(dialog, \"<Control>o\", signal=\"open\")\n\n        def add_accelerator(self, widget, accelerator, signal=\"activate\"):\n            \"\"\" adds <Control>o as accelerator for open-file dialog \"\"\"\n            if accelerator is not None:\n                key, mod = Gtk.accelerator_parse(accelerator)\n            widget.add_accelelator(signal, accel, key, mod, Gtk.AccelFlags.VISIBLE)\n            print(\"works\")\n\n        # grid to organize widgets\n        self.box = Gtk.Box()\n        self.add(self.box)\n        # text view\n        self.textview = Gtk.TextView()\n        self.textview.set_wrap_mode(True)\n        # scroll bar\n        scrollwindow = Gtk.ScrolledWindow()\n        scrollwindow.add(self.textview)\n\n        self.box.pack_start(scrollwindow, True, True, 0)\n\n\nwindow = DeSedit()  # create DeSedit object\nwindow.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\nwindow.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nI get this error: \nFile \"file.py\", line 41, in \n    window = DeSedit()  # create DeSedit object\n  File \"file.py\", line 19, in __init__\n    self.add_accelerator(self.dialog, \"o\", signal=\"open\")\nTypeError: add_accelerator() got an unexpected keyword argument 'signal'\n\n\nA: Most likely you following a PyGtk 2 guide when trying to implement this: According to the GTK 3 documentation there is no function named gtk_window_add_accelerator, but there is a function named gtk_accel_group_connect that looks like its going to get the job done. When working with GTK documentation it's usually 80% gut feeling and 20% checking the docs to seen if your right. Don't expect any fancy tutorials or guides (you'll be disappointed most of the time)…\nAnyway: Looking at the gtk_accel_group_connect documentation, we see these parameters: accel_group, accel_key, accel_mods, accel_flags and closure.\nSo how to call this function from Python? Let's do this step by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since we're in Python (object-oriented language) we can expect the accel_group parameter to be implicit as it's the first parameter and a reference to the object we're trying to modify.\n\n*The next parameter (accel_key) is more tricky: It's an integer and the documentation just tells us key value of the accelerator which basically means figure out yourself how to find the accelerator key value. Fortunately some quick search reveals the function gdk_keyval_from_name which seems to do what we want. (And calling Gdk.keyval_from_name('O') actually returns the right result.)\n\n*Next is the parameter accel_mods: By clicking on its type (GdkModifierType) we get a nice listing of all the possible modifier types. As you wanted to use the <Control> modifier we can just use Gdk.ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK and move on.\n\n*accel_flags also has a clickable type (GtkAccelFlags) and opening its description reveals that none of these parameters are needed so we may safely use 0 for this paramter.\n\n*Finally we're at the last parameter (closure): Since closure is just a fancy word for callback (something that should be called when something happens) we can just use the fact that the Python GTK bindings abstract closures for us and and pass some callable function here that gets called whenever <Control>O was pressed.\n\n\nIn context the code now looks like this (verified to be working):\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk\n\nclass DeSedit(Gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"DeSedit\")\n\n        self.set_default_size(550, 350)\n\n        # FileChooserDialog - Open File\n        dialog = Gtk.FileChooserDialog(\"Select file to be opened\", self,\n            Gtk.FileChooserAction.OPEN,\n            (Gtk.STOCK_CANCEL, Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL,\n            Gtk.STOCK_OK, Gtk.ResponseType.OK))\n        # keyboard shortcuts\n        accel = Gtk.AccelGroup()\n        accel.connect(Gdk.keyval_from_name('O'), Gdk.ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK, 0, self.on_accel_pressed)\n        self.add_accel_group(accel)\n\n        # grid to organize widgets\n        self.box = Gtk.Box()\n        self.add(self.box)\n        # text view\n        self.textview = Gtk.TextView()\n        self.textview.set_wrap_mode(True)\n        # scroll bar\n        scrollwindow = Gtk.ScrolledWindow()\n        scrollwindow.add(self.textview)\n\n        self.box.pack_start(scrollwindow, True, True, 0)\n\n    def on_accel_pressed(self, *args):\n        dialog = Gtk.FileChooserDialog(\"Select file to be opened\", self,\n            Gtk.FileChooserAction.OPEN,\n            (Gtk.STOCK_CANCEL, Gtk.ResponseType.CANCEL,\n            Gtk.STOCK_OK, Gtk.ResponseType.OK))\n        dialog.show()\n\n\nwindow = DeSedit()  # create DeSedit object\nwindow.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\n\nHope this gets you started with GTK+3!\n", "Q: Configure Unity notifications to close on click I like those notification bubbles of Unity, but the one thing I really hate of them is that I can't click them away.\nI know when I hover above them they become almost transparent and that I may click through them on the window below, but I would prefer a small (x) icon to be able to close it.\nAlternatively, it might also close when clicking anywhere on it, that does not matter.\nIs it possible to set this up on Ubuntu 15.04 with Unity Desktop?

I googled and check last of solution but couldnt find how to change fn keys behaviour. I am a Centos user and new on Ubuntu. Please lead me to find place which I can change settings of Fn keys. \n\nA: According to the Lenovo website you may be able to achieve your desired behavior. You also might be able to switch keyboard configuration using FN + Esc. As the decision, which key presses to send to operating system is ultimately made by the Embedded controller of the laptop, there is not a lot that can be done about this by operating system.

I continued with the install even though there was a pre-install error.\nIt completed successfully, and as the instructions indicated, I ran\nsudo apt-get install dkms fakeroot build-essential linux-headers-generic\n\nsince I assumed this was what the pre-install error was about.\nDuring the install I did opt for it to make the xorg configuration files for me (nivida-xconfig).\nI rebooted, and it didn't even get to the login screen - seemingly eternal maroon, followed by a hung terminal: a black screen with an idle _\nI logged back into tty1 to fish around, I removed the blacklist and ran the install script with the --uninstall parameter. It set the config file back and claimed to successfully uninstall.\nI figured I could just try \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331 nvidia-331-updates \n\nJust as I had before (since this proprietary driver install failed).\nThis however failed - apparently in conflict with two packages: \nnvidia-persistenced\nand something like xorg-driver-... something (memory is failing me here).\nSo far so good, I reboot.\nI get the normal login screen - things are looking up. I login, and the screen goes black for a second (seemingly normal - I expect the desktop to load now), but install it starts up another login screen.

This is the safest way to install an Ubuntu-only system on a Mac, and it's what would result if you tried installing Ubuntu and the firmware happened to boot the installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If you then booted the Windows installer but the firmware made the choice to boot it in EFI mode, you'd see the error you describe. The solution is to force a BIOS-mode install of Windows. You might be able to do this by removing the EFI boot loader (which should be in the EFI/BOOT directory on your USB); or perhaps by holding down Alt or Option as you boot, you may be able to force a BIOS-mode boot.\n\n*It could be that your hard disk has a hybrid MBR on the partition table. When it's fed a hybrid MBR, Windows interprets the disk as an MBR disk, ignoring the GPT data. When fed the same disk, OS X and Linux both treat the disk as a GPT disk, ignoring the MBR data (except to the extent that an MBR's type-0xEE partition is part of identifying it as a GPT disk). A hybrid MBR is the most common way of dual-booting OS X and earlier versions of Windows on a Mac. The problem with this hypothesis is that GParted will normally convert a hybrid MBR back to a conventional protective MBR, so it doesn't match your description. It's still a possibility if you omitted something, like running gptsync on the disk. If this is what's happening, then the preferred solution is to make some trivial change to the disk with GParted; or use gdisk to create a fresh protective MBR by using the n option on the experts' menu (x followed by n followed by w to save your changes). (You could go for a BIOS-mode Windows install using the hybrid MBRs, but as hybrid MBRs are a dangerous hack, it's better to install Windows 8 in EFI mode, if possible.)\n\n\nTo be certain which course of action to take, you must examine your partition table. This is pretty easily done with gdisk, as in:\n$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nThis example (which omits partition details) shows a GPT disk with a conventional protective MBR, as identified by the GPT: present and MBR: protective lines. If the MBR line reads MBR: hybrid, then that identifies a GPT disk with a hybrid MBR. If the MBR line reads MBR: MBR only and the GPT line reads GPT: Not present, then the disk is a straight-up MBR disk.\n\nA: You must have formatted the disk with the MBR partition table.  You might be able to do something to fix that without reformatting the drive, see comment below.  You CAN however, backup your data, format with GPT, and install windows THEN recheck Linux.\n", "Q: How to edit multiple text files with a single command?

This Reddit article sums it up: Why isn't there a wireless controller that can wake a PC up?\nWhen I play games in Steam, my computer doesn't recognize that I'm mashing buttons and it goes into sleep/suspend mode. I don't want to disable power management or use wake on LAN. Is there any other way to get my computer to recognize my gamepad's input and not go to sleep? I'd also like to wake my HTPC with the controller.\nThe Logitech F710 and the Xbox 360 wireless controller are HID-compliant in Windows but not Linux (see screenshots below). FYI, the Logitech F710 is HID-compliant in Xinput mode, but not in Directinput modes. \n\nI ran \"lsusb -v\" and have screenshots below for the mouse, Logitech F710, and the Xbox 360 wireless controller. This shows how the mouse registers as a HID-compliant device and how the controllers don't.\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 15.04 with the LXDE desktop on my Kodi/Steam-box. My motherboard is an Asus 990fx r2.0, which only has \"Power On By PME Device\" and \"Power On By Ring\" (I've enabled both). The bios also has \"Power On By RTC\" but that's disabled. I've also plugged the controllers into USB3 and USB5 (the two USB \"devices\" that have enabled S-states). Still no joy.\nHere are the contents of /proc/acpi/wakeup:\nDevice  S-state   Status   Sysfs node\nSBAZ      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:14.2\nPS2K      S3    *disabled\nPS2M      S3    *disabled\nUAR1      S4    *disabled  pnp:00:06\nP0PC      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:14.4\nUHC1      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:12.0\nUHC2      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:12.2\nUHC4      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:13.2\nUHC6      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:16.2\nUHC7      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:14.5\nPC02      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:02.0\nPC03      S4    *disabled\nPC04      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:04.0\nPC05      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:05.0\nPC06      S4    *disabled\nPC07      S4    *disabled\nPC09      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:09.0\nPC0A      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:0a.0\nPC0B      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:0b.0\nPC0C      S4    *disabled\nPC0D      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:0d.0\nPE20      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.0\nPE21      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.1\nPE22      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.2\nPE23      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.3\nUSB3      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:13.0\nUSB5      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:00:16.0\nPWRB      S4    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0C:00\n\nWhy aren't the controllers registering as HID-compliant devices?\n\nA: I would try Caffeine. Go to a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and copy-paste:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nand then add caffeine-indicator to your startup applications. \n\nA: Good news. I just tried the Steam Controller, and it registers as a HID on Windows and Linux. I just tested this with my new steam controller, and it indeed will wake the computer from sleep. I put it to sleep through the Steam big picture interface, let the machine fully deactivate (fans and LEDs off), and then hit the Steam button on the controller. Everything came to life. Score another point for the steam controller over wireless xbox360 controllers.\n::UPDATE::\nThis is only partially correct as it only keeps the system from suspending when the controller is being used as a keyboard or mouse. When the controller is mapped to a typical xbox controller's buttons, the system still keeps suspending.\n\n\n", "Q: Software Centre won't open nor will Ubuntu update I am unable to open Software Centre.

On my Ubuntu system, dpkg-query cannot find some uninstalled packages which apt-cache can find. For instance,\ndpkg-query -l libssl-dev\n\ngives me:\ndpkg-query: no packages found matching libssl-dev\n\nwhile:\napt-cache show libssl-dev\n\nfinds the package information. At the same time, dpkg-query can locate other uninstalled packages, e.g. gimp and show their status as uninstalled. Why are some packages not visible to dpkg-query?\n\nA: Basically, dpkg-query shows you what is installed on your system, or even packages which has been installed on your system and then been removed at some point.\nInterestingly enough, if a package uses a dependency of another package, dpkg may list them as installed even though one of them was never fully installed on the system.\nBut apt is used to download packages from the repositories defined in your sources.list and sources.d/* directory.\nin other words, apt-cache shows the packages that \"could be installed\" on your system not the ones already installed/uninstalled. \n", "Q: GParted Resize/Move Options What does \"Free space preceding\" and \"Free space following\" mean? I checked GParted manual but could not find an answer. \n\nA: Free space preceding is used if you are moving the partition to make space for a new partition to the left of the current partition.\nFree space following is used to create space for new partition that follows (right side of) the current partition.\nFor eg: In the following, I've re-sized my current partition to create 501MB space for a new partition on left and another for a 323MB partition on right of my current partition.\n\nYou have to be careful when moving the start sector of partition because if you move the Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows system partition C: your computer might not boot.\n", "Q: Navigating in the Nautilus 3.10.1 side pane using the keyboard I would like to be able to navigate the main file manager window as well as the Nautilus (3.10.1) side pane using just the keyboard (arrow keys etc.).\nHow do I switch between being able to navigate in the side pane and in the main window using the keyboard?

(OTOH, if you have a backup of your EFI System Partition, or ESP, from before the error occurred, you may be able to recover by restoring that backup. IMHO, such a backup should be made as a matter of course both before and after installing Ubuntu -- but that's another matter.) If I'm right about this, you'll need to get your hands on a Windows recovery disk, use it to fix the Windows boot loader, and then re-install a Linux boot loader or change the boot order so that what you've got now boots first.\nI also recommend you re-read my second response to your answer to your earlier question. In particular, prepare a rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R and try booting with it. This tool (which I maintain) can boot Ubuntu without GRUB, and can chainload to the Windows boot loader, so if GRUB is acting up, rEFInd can provide a workaround -- either temporary or permanent.\nDisclaimer: I'm not a fan of GRUB 2. It's a bloated pig of a program with a finicky configuration file that's so difficult to maintain that GRUB provides a series of scripts to perform that task. The result is like a house of cards -- it holds together OK under optimal conditions, but if anything about your configuration is sub-optimal, the whole thing will come tumbling down and be difficult to put back together again. FWIW, my disaffection with GRUB 2 is what motivated me to fork the earlier rEFIt into rEFInd. GRUB 2 has improved since that time, but the fact that I took on maintenance of an open source boot manager rather than deal with GRUB 2 should say something about GRUB 2's problems, at least in my eyes.\n\nA: The problem that I had was the corrupted bootmgfw.efi file. To restore that create a bootable windows 10 usb (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and boot into the recovery mode. Click Troubleshoot > Command Prompt. Copy the file C:\\Windows\\Boot\\EFI\\bootmgfw.efi to some other location like C:. I had a dual boot computer so I then rebooted into linux and copied the recovered bootmgfw.efi file into \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot. This solved the problem.\n", "Q: juju environment not found, can't bootstrap I installed juju onto Ubuntu 15.04 and have been using it for a few days.

I worry my encryption might complicate things.\nAny guidance on how to find out just what damage I've done and how to recover it?\n\nA: Well, in the end, someone else on another forum DID take a few minutes moment to walk me through Testdisk, have a look at what I got, and explain how to interpret it and what the next step should be.\nIn the end, it wasn't just a case of \"Use Testdisk\".\nFound this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=895224\n(oddly enough, no-one helped this guy out either...)\nLong story short, even if you nuke your partiton table with mklabel, the data IS stil there, and if you can find out the sectors where the partitions used to be, you CAN put a new partition table in place and it will let you access the data.\nSo I gave gdisk a go, because apparently it's supposed to be able to restore backup GPT table....except it didn't. No idea why, but despite apparently finding a backup table, restoring it did nothing.\nThen by sheer luck I found this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2214497\n(also another person who had to \"bite the bullet\" and go for it without advice...)\nAgain, summarizing -\nDespite what it says (or rather, doesn't say) on its documentation Testdisk for whatever reason can't restore full LUKS partitions. In fact it cant even find them!! But - you can at least use it to get some ideas on what sector the LUKS partition might have started - it  at least picks up the LUKS header as a 4096 / 2MB partition. \nYou can then take the starting sector of this header and make a new partition manually from there to the end sector of the disk (assuming you encrypted all the remaining disk - if you don't know the end sector you're in trouble, testdisk can't find it. But if you get it right and write a new partitions table with those sectors, viola - you have a mountable partition and can recover your data. If you can find the sectors you can restore the EFI and boot partitions too (test disk at least can do this itself, it picks up the FAT and efs2). \nHowever no matter what flags I put on them, it still wouldn't boot.So instead, I dd'd each of these recovered partitions separately onto an external drive, re-installed a a fresh encrypted copy of ubuntu, then dd'd the recovered partitions back into their respective places. The partiton sizes are all identical and it all booted up like nothing had ever changed, even swap worked.\nSo, what have I learned? Well, if you fry your partition table, even with an encrypted install, the data IS recoverable.\nAnd motorbike forums  provide apparently provide more tech help in an afternoon than the actual Ubuntu support sites provide in a month... :/\nAnd folks wonder why people won't use Linux...\n", "Q: How do I update an application that's installed using Ubuntu Make?

Instead the first login is on the top (above the logins for July).\nI failed to save the screenshot, since as of now last's output erased all of July's. It's like /var/log/wtmp did not refresh instantly at login which I expected it to be. Some comments suggested in the part 1 of my post says that it refreshes every first day of the month.

My guess is that your disk (or some other disk-related component, like a cable or your motherboard's disk controller circuitry) was on its last legs, and the \"exercise\" involved in installing Ubuntu caused it to fail. You don't say what prompted you to install Ubuntu, but if you were having problems with Windows reliability, it's possible that this was an earlier symptom of the problem.\nYou might try unplugging your disk (from both ends of the cable if it's a desktop system) and plugging it back in again. You could also try running a SMART test from an Ubuntu live CD -- but if the disk isn't detected by your firmware, it might not even show up in Ubuntu, which would make such a test impossible.\nIf you've got a spare disk, you could try using it instead. If it works, then you can pretty much conclude that your old disk is dead. If the replacement disk fails, too, then chances are the problem is with your computer motherboard's circuitry.\n\nA: Try to replace older cables and defective HDD\nIt worked for me.

Try man wget, which says, in part:  \n   -O file\n   --output-document=file\n       The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all will be concatenated together and written to file.  If - is used as\n       file, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link conversion.  (Use ./- to print to a file literally named -.)\n\n       Use of -O is not intended to mean simply \"use the name file instead of the one in the URL;\" rather, it is analogous to shell\n       redirection: wget -O file http://foo is intended to work like wget -O - http://foo > file; file will be truncated immediately, and all\n       downloaded content will be written there.\n\n       For this reason, -N (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in combination with -O: since file is always newly created, it will\n       always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this combination is used.\n\n       Similarly, using -r or -p with -O may not work as you expect: Wget won't just download the first file to file and then download the\n       rest to their normal names: all downloaded content will be placed in file. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated\n       (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this behavior can actually have some use.\n\n       Note that a combination with -k is only permitted when downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert all relative\n       URIs to external ones; -k makes no sense for multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file; -k can be used only when\n       the output is a regular file.\n\nand  \n   -q\n   --quiet\n       Turn off Wget's output.\n\n\nA: For this kind of questions, if you have a browser nearby you might find it handy to use explainshell.com (as man pages can be quite long to go through to find the parameters you interested in):\n\n", "Q: Windows 7 doesn't boot; no device, invalid sig Booting to Windows 7 has worked in the past.

The default one in 14.04 is Mesa 10.3.2 which is very out of date compared to the latest Mesa release.In case you are running 10.3.2 you can easily update it to 10.6.3 by installing the xorg egers ppa.In order to do so type this in the terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nAfter that type this in the terminal and your Mesa driver should be updated.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAfter that reboot and check if the latest Mesa version is installed by using Glxinfo if it's not already installed.Then just install it by this into the terminal\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nAfter Glxinfo is installed you can now check the Mesa version by typing this into terminal(It should say 10.6.3 now)\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\"\n\nThe fps lag in Chromium should now be gone If I assume correctly.\n", "Q: \"i8042 no controller found\" error while trying to install ubuntu on Mac Book Pro early 2011 Trying to install ubuntu with rEFInd on a mac book pro 15 early 2011 model.\n\"i8042 no controller found\" error comes up and prevents installation. I have read the other answers regarding the topic but they have not worked such as running\n\"i8042.nomux\" but it does not work or I am doing it wrong.\nWhat is the problem? Any straightforward solutions?\n\nA: AskUbuntu user Velin knew how to fix this problem so I'm just reposting his answer:\nFor anyone else having this problem, it seems like it might be caused by a display driver issue. This can be fixed by adding the 'nomodeset' parameter in the kernel settings on startup. This instructs the kernel to not load video settings during startup but leave it to the X driver when it loads. This means no beautiful splash screen on startup but it beats a non-functional kernel.\nThe following link might be useful for people who don't know how to add the parameter: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132\nPS This issue might also be fixable by correcting video driver settings once the system is booted up. However, this still requires the above step for an initial boot.\n", "Q: transmission stopped working - doesn't download anything Transmission has stopped working on Ubuntu 15.04. It doesn't download anything. Check the attached pictures. I am not sure how to debug this. Pls help.\nI installed Vuze and its able to download the torrents. Works fine. But I prefer to use Transmission as its very lightweight.\n\n\n\nA: From the pictures it looks like something is blocking your connection to the tracker, which is what connects you to everyone else that is seeding/sharing the ISO file. Depending on where you are and what ISP you have P2P stuff like torrenting might be blocked (or illegal, even though this is a legitimate usage). I would say check your network settings and make sure nothing is set to filter out P2P (Peer-to-Peer), connections. Specifically any kind of proxy server your connection might be using, like if you're doing this at work for example.\n\nA: From what I can tell from what you posted, it looks like transmission isn't connecting to peers for some reason, even though it knows about them. Since you say that Vuze works, you should probably verify that you didn't change any settings for the torrent by accident (under options, check whether a rate or peer limit is set for the torrent). Similarly, you'll want to check the global settings.\nNormally I'd also suggest to check that there are no other torrents eating up all the bandwidth or connections, but your screenshot shows only one torrent active, so that's probably not it. However, did you try to get another torrent with transmission?\n", "Q: Manually partitioning 15.04 Server for RAID 0 I'm trying to install Ubuntu Server (15.04) on a 2012 Mac mini with two 240GB SSDs. I recognize that Macs can be tricky with EFI v. BIOS, but that's another issue. I'd like to install Ubuntu Server on these two SSDs in RAID 0, but I'm unclear on what the partitions should look like.\nFrom Googling, I know that each SSD should have identical partitions (size and name/function). So I set up each to have a 500MB EFI Partition System (EPS)partition, then a 4-8GB swap partition, and finally the rest goes to / as an Ext4 file system. I've read that GRUB cannot be installed on a RAID array, so I leave the 500MB partitions out of RAID, and pair the swap and / individually as RAID 0.\nAlternatively, I've read that I should be using LVM for creating a logical volume group... out of the swap RAID and / RAID arrays?\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: LVM offers features very similar to RAID 0, and is more flexible -- it's easier to combine two disks of different sizes with LVM than with RAID 0, for instance. I also happen to be more familiar with Linux's LVM than with Linux's software RAID, so that's what I'd use in your case. Somebody who's more familiar with RAID might make the other choice, and that's fine; for your purposes, chances are either will work equally well, provided you don't need to make changes in the future.\nI believe the Ubuntu setup tool has an option to use LVM, but I'm only passingly familiar with that path through the installer. It's also got a known bug that creates a /boot partition that's too small. The Ubuntu LVM wiki entry should help you get started with LVM. In brief, you'll create a /boot partition (I recommend making it at least 500MiB) on one disk and at least one LVM partition on each disk. You can then link them together and create whatever logical volumes you want to span the disks. You can stripe logical volumes across disks to improve performance, if you like.\nAn EFI System Partition (ESP) will also be necessary if you install Ubuntu in EFI mode. This may not be optimal for a Mac, though; ironically, it's easier to install Ubuntu in BIOS mode on Macs, at least for single-boot systems. The reason is that managing EFI boot loaders on Macs is best done using the bless utility in OS X. The standard Ubuntu tool for this task, efibootmgr, doesn't always work quite right on Macs -- although I've seen indications that it's working better in such configurations than it did a few years ago. If you do a BIOS-mode install, you must use the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system; this signals to the Mac firmware that it should activate its BIOS (aka legacy) boot support.\nIf you go with a RAID setup, it will be similar, with a separate (non-RAID) /boot partition and (if you do an EFI installation) an ESP. If your disks are identical in size, I'd put one of these on each disk and make them identical in size; that will enable you to make your other partitions identical in size, for no lost disk space.\nNote that GRUB can, in theory, read kernels from RAID or LVM setups, so in theory you don't need a separate /boot partition; however, when using LVM or RAID, every distribution I know of sets up a separate /boot partition. I don't know if the distribution maintainers know of a bug or complications, but at the very least, this means that GRUB's ability to read kernels from within an LVM or RAID is relatively untested. Also, most non-GRUB tools can't read from within an LVM or RAID, so if you don't create a separate /boot partition, you'll be tying your hands when it comes to boot loaders.\n", "Q: PureVPN installation I use PureVPN in order to get a swedish ipadress enable me to see swedish television even if I live abroad. I have difficulties installing PureVPN on Ubuntu. Please help.\n\nA: Ignore IP tables makes things complicated. Use UFW.\nUFW is the default firewall in Ubuntu, so it is already installed, no need doing that, and should already be set to launch at startup.\nGo in the .ovpn for the PureVPN server you want to add find the IP address of the server you are connecting to. If it is a URL (e.g. USA1.com) you'll need to resolve the URL to find IP address (since we are going to block DNS requests that don't go over VPN). Now enter the terminal. Now we are going to block all traffic on the computer.\nsudo ufw default deny outgoing  \n\nDo this for incoming also:\nsudo ufw default deny incoming   \n\nNow we want to make it so there is an exception for VPN. If you are using OpenVPN and TUN as network adapter (you most probably are) then we call the network interface as tun0.\nAllow outgoing traffic on tun0:\nsudo ufw allow out on tun0 from any to any  \n\nNow security-wise you don't need to allow incoming traffic to use the internet, but you may want to require it (for example for seeding torrents this is necessary). So add it if you want:\nsudo ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any  \n\nSo now all traffic is allowed on VPN and no traffic is allowed without VPN. But it's really annoying to need to turn firewall on and off each time we want to connect to a VPN, so we'll add an exception for establishing the initial connection to the VPN server.\nsudo ufw allow out from any to 109.201.128.0  \n\nReplace 109.201.128.0 in the above command with the IP of your VPN.\nNow let's enable UFW:\nsudo ufw enable  \n\nIdeally you would want to only enable desired traffic on tun0 as currently tun0 is DMZed, but that's up to you. By default UFW will start up when Ubuntu does so as long as you set it to enabled you have a fail-safe activated from startup and you'll never need to touch it. Using Linux with this fail-safe and network manager GUI for OpenVPN and it works absolutely flawlessly. The way VPNs where meant to be appearing (natively integrated with a fail-safe). You can check the status and rules of UFW using the following command:\nsudo ufw status  \n\nIf you aren't using Ubuntu and ufw isn't the default firewall, then in addition to enabling ufw (despite terminal saying after enabling it that it is enabled on startup this isn't true if ufw isn't a startup app) you will need to add ufw to startup apps. Ubuntu already does this for you out of the box.\nSources:\nhttp://support.purevpn.com/pptp-configuration-guide-for-ubuntu\nhttp://www.purevpnreview.com/ \n\nA: I'm going to compose an answer here for documentation purposes.\nStep 1: Install OpenVPN\nRun following command in terminal\nsudo apt install network-manager-openvpn\n\nType Y and hit enter to continue.\nNow run following two command in terminal\nsudo apt install network-manager-openvpn-gnome    \n\nStep 2: Configure PureVPN OpenVPN Connection\nNow download the required OpenVPN File from\nhttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/heartbleed/linux/linux-files.zip\n\nThis archive is going to contain a bunch of .ovpn files for TCP/UDP protocols, a .crtcertificate file and a .key key file.

I appreciate any and all help!\n\nA: TL;DR Yes, your versioning would work.\n\nA short copy and paste from Building a source package – Versioning\n\nVersioning\nUbuntu package names are suffixed by the version number of the\n  package. This allows Ubuntu to distinguish newer packages from older\n  ones and so remain up to date.\nIf you're creating an alternative version of a package already\n  available in Ubuntu's repositories, you should ensure that:\nyour package supersedes the official Ubuntu version\nfuture Ubuntu versions will supersede your package. \n\nTo do this, add the suffix ppan (where n is your package's revision\n  number). Two examples:\nUbuntu package myapp_1.0-1 → PPA package myapp_1.0-1ppa1\n\nUbuntu package myapp_1.0-1ubuntu3 → PPA package myapp_1.0-1ubuntu3ppa1 \n\nVersion numbers must be unique. This has implications if you want to\n  provide packages for multiple Ubuntu series at once:\nIf your package can be used on different versions of Ubuntu without\n  being recompiled then use the naming scheme already described. When\n  you have successfully uploaded your package to your PPA you can copy\n  the existing binaries to the new series; see Copying packages.\nIf your package does need to be recompiled to support multiple Ubuntu\n  series, then you should add a suffix of a tilde and the series name to\n  the version number. So a package for the Intrepid Ibex could be named\n  myapp_1.0-1ubuntu3ppa1~intrepid1 and for the Hardy Heron\n  myapp_1.0-1ubuntu3ppa1~hardy1. If you need to release an updated\n  package, increment the ppan suffix.

It's not so bad, but I would prefer to get back to what I was doing more quickly.\nI vaguely remember that at some point, I SSHed into a machine and found that whatever long-running command I had been doing before I disconnected was still running.\nI'm aware of tmux. I know it is a viable solution but I would prefer one that Just Works(tm).\nSo that's my question. Is there some way I can configure SSH to not kill my sessions if they get disconnected, so that if I reconnect I go right back to what I was doing?\nThanks\n\nA: Screen is a terminal multiplexer, which allows a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session (such as when using SSH).\nScreen is very useful if you're connection is not stable. For example if you want to download a file with wget and exit from ssh, then come back to it in an hour or so. \nyou can create a new 'virtual console' by simply typing screen in console. Then after you're disconnected from your ssh session, you can connect anytime you want, issue screen -r command to re-attach yourself to the virtual console\nfull screen documentation and commands\n\nA: mosh - uses UDP ports to 'check and restore' the original connection.* (*analogy description, not a technologically correct description).\nscreen is good for opening up a new 'workspace' on your server that you can connect and disconnect to whenever you resume a session. Personally, I do terminal work between \"real work\" on the sly, so ssh-ing back into a session and opening screen is cumbersome, whereas Mosh will simply resume the SSH connection if the pipe is \"broken\" without interrupting the session.\nProbably less secure at your location if you leave it open, but convenience factor for simply \"getting on with it\" or drifting connections means that you don't have to go through the reconnect and reattachment of screen sessions.\nWhen in doubt, use both. :)\n", "Q: can't connect to wifi using Xubuntu Everytime i try to connect to internet using wifi i type the password, Xubuntu tries to connect for a little while and then asks me the password again.

But if I try using Network Manager, it works, but no internet access.\nTo fix this, edit the OpenVPN connection configuration on Network Manager and click in IPv4 Settings tab, then click in Routes button:\n\nThen mark Use this connection only for resources on its network.\n\nClick Ok, then Save and reconnect.\n\nA: Problem makes routes. To be precise, default route. \nFirst, if you wish to route all traffic trough vpn in NM you do not check option \"use this connection only for resources on its network\".\nSecond problem is route about default gw  \n0.0.0.0         10.211.1.2      128.0.0.0       UG    0      0        0 tun0 \nProblem can fix with manual adding route or check configuration on vpn server. \nTo set manual route for all traffic go to tun0 after connecting to vpn put command\nip route add default via ip_address_of_vpn_server\n\nEdit 1\nWait, you can add default route aka default, if you wish traffic go to wlan0 with command \nsudo ip route add default via 172.16.156.65 \nor for traffic routing through vpn \nsudo ip route add default via  10.211.1.2 \nAfter that you can add more route\nExample, if you wont to go to 106.158.15.233 via wlan0\n ip route add 106.158.15.233/32 via 172.16.156.65 dev wlan0\n\nor via vpn\n ip route add 106.158.15.233/32 via 10.211.1.2 dev tun0\n\n172.16.156.65 is address of your wifi router\n10.211.1.2 is address of your vpn server\n\nA: You can simply solve this issue by turning on your firewall. In Linux Mint, i went to Firewall Configuration and turned on the Firewall. After that I connected VPN and there was no problem. I hope that helps.\n\nA: I know this is old but I dont have a working solve to this problem from this thread and have a similar problem.\nHere is my problem. I downloaded my openVPN keys from my router. installed on Linuxmint Virtual machine and ElementaryOS both Virtual and Host OS on a laptop.. Both versions give the same problem. VPN connects but has absolutely no traffic through it. \nEnabling \"use this connection only for resources on its network\" is completely useless and i still don't get access to the vpn network resources anyways. scratch that...\nHere is what I did.. I noticed some said when they connected via command line vpn seemed to work. the problem must resides in the fact you can not import the openVPN configuration. so i pulled out my trusty text editor opened the openvpn .conf file. I noticed in the openvpn connection profile it had an \"advanced\" tab. with lots of various options. So I attempted to translate all the config options into the advanced tab and what do you know... it worked...\n[Solve]\nSo i did it again on the laptop with a different distro..\nI changed options One by One this time checking the vpn each time and the vpn started functioning after i configured the compression. \nUnder Connection Settings\nVPN > Advanced button > Check Use LZO Data Compression (I set to adaptive) and the tunnel started functioning no issues and \"My IP\" shows as the vpn router's external IP.\nThere is no special configs or firewall or anything in my experience. Just need to set all the options the same as the config file and you can use the built in network manager to handle it.\n\nA: I know the issue may have been resolved, but in my case the solution didn't survive a reboot. So, I found another solution for the openvpn terminal not giving internet access on Ubuntu 14.04 by adding --management localhost 1194 to the arguments. Like:\nroot@user /# openvpn --config file.ovpn --management localhost 1194.\n\nIt's handy if you don't want to split the config file to the 3 other files for use from the network-manager applet.\n\nA: The best solution I've found is to open a terminal and do the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n\nin the file that opens up, add the following:\nnameserver 208.67.222.222\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\n\nsave the file and run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nTry connecting to your OpenVPN server now. You should be good to go!\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nwhen you config openvpn , the firewall is necessary.\nyou should configure a firewall and pass openvpn traffic through the firewall.\n\nA: Сheck the metric of routes with the command ip route: if the metric tun0 is less than the default interface metric, then all traffic will go through OpenVPN and there will be no internet.\nYou can change the metric by editing the file in the directory /etc/netplan/ (some examples in Netplan configuration examples), then run netplan apply.\nСhecked for Ubuntu 18.04 / 19.10 / 20.04, everywhere the standard client was used NetworkManager and editing helped everywhere.\n\nA: For those who are using ubuntu 18.04 and have no access to network-manager-openvpn-gnome I found a solution that worked for me. As far as I know is just a different way to do the same configuration.\nsudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<name of your vpn connection>\n\nIn the section ipv4 you append a new line: never-default=true\n[ipv4]\ndns-search=\nmethod=auto\nnever-default=true\n\nAfter you should restart your NetworkManager\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service\n\n", "Q: Why would cron not be running as a daemon? I'm on Ubuntu 15.04, and logged in as root, but when I run \nps -ef | grep cron | grep -v grep\n\nto make sure the cron daemon is running, I see the -f option, which means it is running in the foreground and not as as a daemon.  I have not changed anything related to cron since setting this up (on DigitalOcean, from their stock 15.04 image).  Why would it not run as a daemon? \n(And yes I know I should be using systemd instead.  This was meant to be a quick & dirty solution—since cron is so simple and reliable, right!?—until I could get my *.service files debugged and working.)\n\nA: Because it is being run by systemd, there is no need for it to fork itself into the background as it is not being called by a shell script that waits for it to exit ( after forking itself into the background ).\n\nA: \nI see the -f option, which means it is running in the foreground and not as as a daemon.\n\nNo.  It means that it didn't do a useless little fork-and-exit dance when it started up.  These little dances are (vain) attempts to dæmonize programs, on the assumption that one is starting up dæmons by logging in to an interactive session and running the programs from the shell.  That doesn't actually work reliably and securely, and is the source of war stories over the years from people who attempted to start dæmons that way and were unpleasantly surprised.\ncron is already dæmonized by dint of being run under a service manager.  It doesn't have to do anything at all to become a dæmon.  And doing so ranges from pointless to actively detrimental to the good operation of the system.  So the convention — thanks to a quarter of a century of people wanting this sort of thing for running dæmons under daemontools, runit, IBM's SRC, and so forth — is to employ whatever command line options simply turn these little dances off.  Proper service management has no need of them.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Jonathan de Boyne Pollard (2004). Mistakes to avoid when designing Unix dæmon programs.

I bought a Samsung wireless printer and now I see that Linux support is really primitive. None of the major applications run on Linux, and even the only program referenced by the documentation (SetIP) isn't included in the linux driver and is nowhere to be found! Can I configure the printer without connecting it to a Windows or Mac?\n\nA: I found the answer myself with the help of this post, as the documentation for the printer is really bad. Fortunately it is possible to configure the printer within Linux. The key to setting Samsung printers up is the web server they include, a software called SyncThru Web Service. As previouly mentioned, all other software is platform specific and won't run on linux.\nMy printer is a SL-C410W one, but these instructions should work for most Samsung models. There are a few ways to connect to and use the printer, I mention a few of them and give the steps to configure the printer:\nTypical USB connection\nOf course you can plug the printer and configure it like any other. For this, just download the Unified Linux Driver from Samsung web site, untar and run\n$> sudo ./install.sh\n\nthen your printer should be auto-detected when adding it from in ubuntu Printers panel.\nNetwork connection\nThe tricky part is to connect to the printer and configure it. There are a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your PC to the printer directly via Ethernet \n\n*Connect your PC to the printer directly via WiFi\n\n*Connect the printer to a router via an Ethernet cable and make it available to your network (useful for configuration)\n\n*Connect the printer to a router via an WiFi and make it available to your network (useful for configuration)\n\n\nIn any of these ways, after the printer itself is properly configured, you have to configure your Ubuntu. Just open Printers panel and add a network printer, it should be auto-detected.\nOf the options just mentioned the first two are not very useful for configuration. The problem is this: the printer is not yet configured, plugging it to your ethernet port won't connect correctly (at least easily, because it requires a manual connection config), and to connect via WiFi you need the password, which you don't have. Pressing the printer's cancel button for 2 seconds should print the network information, but as the printer isn't yet connected it will only print useless data.\nThe easiest way to solve all this is to plug the printer to your router. After this, the router will give it an IP address, which you can find opening your router's page in the browser. Then, you can open SyncThru in the browser to configure the printer: just write the printer's IP address in the address bar of your browser and voilà. Besides, after connecting the printer to the router, pressing its \"cancel\" button will work as expected, printing a lot of information including the WiFi password.\nTo be able to actually configure the printer you'll have to log in. Look at the top-right corner, where you'll find a \"connect\" link. The default user/pass combination is admin/sec00000.\n", "Q: How can I boot Ubuntu trial from USB drive on Windows 8.1 PC with SSD?

Going by one of my experience, the mac addresses pointing to the  names eth0,eth1, eth2 would have been become redundant by  a mother board/network card replacement in the machine. So if this caused by a network interface going away from the machine, you can safely delete them. \n\nA: The interface names are assigned by udev dynamically or according to the rules declared in the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Although udev manages devices dynamically, putting the rules in this file make udev to take persistent decisions about the interfaces defined here.\nSo to change the name of an interface, open the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, find the appropriate interface first by checking the MAC address e.g. ATTR{address}==\"00:1a:XX:YY:c9:ZZ\". After finding the interface you want to change the name, replace the name e.g. NAME=\"eth3\" at last of the line with the name you want e.g. NAME=\"eth0\"\nSo the line becomes :\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"00:1a:XX:YY:c9:ZZ\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nAlso do the same for other interface rules too if you want to change their names too. After doing the renaming restart the computer and the interfaces should be renamed properly.\nAlso note that as you have interfaces defined already with names eth0 and eth1, disable those rules by deleting or commenting out the lines containing the rules first, otherwise there will be a conflict and renaming won't be done.\n", "Q: Network adapter not working with Dell Vostro 1500 Ubuntu 14.04 I installed 14.04 on Dell Vostro 1500 but my network card isn't recognized.

Thanks.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, with the release of 15.04 Ubuntu touch screen and touch pad support has been upgraded and works fairly well.

But I would like to just fix it entirely. \nIt's not a hardware issue, because it works fine on windows. \n\nA: Definitely receiver placement. I have my laptop mounted on the back of my big monitor and use the laptop monitor as a second screen that sits on top of the external one. If I put the receiver on the left USB everything gets wonky. On the left it sits between the HDMI and aux cables and I think that is part of the problem with the additional distance. But if my laptop is just sitting on my kitchen counter, I can use the mouse/keyboard from 10 feet away no problem. \nAlso make sure your phone is not near (12 inches-ish) or directly between keyboard/mouse and receiver. When mine lags, I just mindlessly look for my phone and move it and all is good again. \nI think it's the bluetooth on the phone but phones kick out a lot of junk so not sure. I'm not going to start turning BT off just to resolve this so never tested this theory.\n\nA: Another user reports that the positioning of the receiver could make a difference (see https://askubuntu.com/a/589132/89042).\nI just tried moving the receiver to one of the USB ports in the front panel of my desktop PC and it seems to have improved (I have tested it for only few minutes so far, though). Mine is a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard/Mouse combo.\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure about placement of the receiver as much as the bus it physically on. I was having similar issues - erratic behavior with a MX Performance mouse under 14.04. Tried lots of suggestions including upgrading to 3.19.0.xxx kernel, little seemed to work.\nWhat I do recall was the receiver was on one of the \"ports on the back of the machine\".... looking into that It was worse, attached to an unpowered USB hub with several other devices. I simply moved it to a \"front panel\" port and it hasn't crapped out since. Plugging an ordinary corded mouse into the machine seemed to work fine - and at that point I was pretty sure it wasn't driver related. \n\nA: I've had the same problem. It turned out that it was due to a USB hub that I'm using. If I plug the keyboard's USB receiver directly into the computer it works without lag or delay. No idea why it wasn't a problem with Windows. This just in case someone else comes across this thread with the same issue.\n\nA: To Debug the issue try removing the wireless mouse or keyboard and replacing with a wired version. It worked for me per Wired mouse Works AOK now without odd random wireless mouse hangs.\nPlanning to monitor for any other issues like so:\n$ dmesg | grep -i \"perf: interrupt took too long\"\n\n[50786.060135] perf: interrupt took too long (2504 > 2500), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 79750\n\n[109527.659324] perf: interrupt took too long (3132 > 3130), lowering kernel.perf_event_max_sample_rate to 63750\n\n", "Q: Nvidia ASUS Strix gtx960 Kubuntu 14.04: screen tear and ghosting Background: I'm having issues with the Nvidia ASUS Strix GTX960.\nI am using Kubuntu 14.04.\nI just built a brand new system, upgrading from my laptop with AMD HD radeon.

CorelDRAW9 was released in late August 1999 and is almost 16 years old!\nInkscape is free, modern, and works well in Ubuntu, it may be a slight learning curve from what you are used to, but it is better to learn something modern and up to date!\nIf you don't like it there is Krita, or if you are actually trying to touch up or edit photos there is GIMP. You may be able to get the program running in WINE but it is not a long term solution, the program pre-dates any modern operating system. You may get it running now, but with each newer operating system the chances of it working decrease, while the features in modern (free) software just keep on getting better.\n\nA: According to the WINE Application Database you should be able to just install and use CorelDRAW 9 by inserting the CD and running the SETUP.EXE file.

Attempting to do a sound test on the headphones is fruitless.\n\n\nI ran a sound diagnostic through ALSA; here's the link to my results:\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=c14a976b8064958b561750ffcd29282236316dfb\nCan anyone help me out? I like GNOME a lot so far, and don't understand why changing desktop environments would mess up sound, yet alone only the headphones. \n\nA: On command line try \nalsamixer\n\nit will open a \"gui\" with several columns for each output, move with the left arrow key to the second one <headphnes>, and with the up arrow key, increase the volume.\nIt worked for me with the headphones and subwoofer.\n\nA: try to see\n- if the headphones in alsamixer are muted. It is visualized with a M at the bottom of the volumemeter.\nalso on my Dell XPS 13 (Kubuntu 15.04, 4.1.2 Mainline Kernel), when the headphones are plugged in at boot time they stay mute. I always have to unplug and plug again for them to work.\nMaybe that helps?\n\n\n*\n- \n\n", "Q: Why Evolution is used? what it's need? I have installed evolution.\nbut,\nWhy evolution is used?\nwhy it is needed?\nHow to use it?\n\nA: Evolution is a desktop email client. It is useful if you want to manage your email from a program (similar to using outlook on a windows PC) rather than using a web interface. It can also manage calendars, and with the evolution-ews extension it has exchange support which is useful for many people in businesses who use exchange for their business email.\nIf you do all of your email and contacts via a web interface it may be of no use to you, but it is a good fully featured mail client.\n", "Q: Is it advisable to delete ~/.cache files? ~/.cache/*\n\nIs it good to delete all the files in .cache folder?\n\nA: The cache folder is a place programs stored data they may need again, it is kept for speed but is not essential to keep. It can be generated again or downloaded again (depending on the data and the program).\nIf your hard drive is really filling up it may be worth checking the .cache folder but it is unlikely to be too huge. If it gets too big you can delete things without worrying. But probably if a GB or 2 is having a significant effect on your performance you may need to consider moving other files or getting more storage.\n\nA: As you can deduct from its name, it's a cache. Deleting its content doesn't harm your system.\nI've removed my cache folder many times without any problems.\nAt the latest after a new login, everything is back to normal.\nBut you will notice an increased activity of your system because the cache of the various programs will be recreated.\n", "Q: Proprietary FGLRX module fails to compile due to GPL only code (Ubuntu 15.04) After latest round of updates fglrx failed to compile dkms module on both of my laptops.  1 laptop has switchable graphics and the other does not.

I would like to develop a myu own UI for ubuntu.But I wouldn't like complex C-coding to do that! Rather HTML & CSS are getting more powerful and we can even make a desktop class application with that. Is it possible to create UI for entire ubuntu(or Just a theme for Ubuntu) with HTML & CSS?\n\nA: You can develop using HTML + Javascript for the interface by using an embedded WebKit frame in a Gtk window (this is easiest to do in Python). The hardest part is communicating with the system from your HTML/Javascript application.\nYou can do this by passing messages between Javascript and Python. You will, however, have to write the system logic as Python functions but this is pretty easy to do.\nFor more details you can follow this link: https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/apps/html-5/\n", "Q: Software not running in wine 1.7 ubuntu 15.04 Kindly assist with an application from Bridgewood Design. i installed a software called cut list plus on wine 15.04.

It doesn't have ethernet port, nor wifi capabilities.\nIf your printer is connected to a Windows machine make sure hp1515 is marked as shared printer over your network. Open Start menu, go to Devices and Printers, right-click on hp1515 icon, go to Sharing tab, check the 'Share this printer' box.\nThen go to your Ubuntu machine, find Printer settings (depending on your desktop environment) and add 1515 as a network printer. You need the Windows machine to be running while any printing job, because printing is done through that machine. For easy management of hp printers under linux, make sure you install graphical interface for hplip, like this: Open a Terminal window and type: sudo apt-get install hplip-gui and press Enter.\nOr you could try connect the printer directly into usb port of your router (if any usb available on your router) and check 'printer server' settings of your router (it depends on router firmware, usually done in an internet browser using a web interface for the router). If you manage to connect printer directly to your router, you will no longer need the Windows machine, the router will become the printer server and will manage all the print jobs.\n", "Q: How do i secure[hardening] existing Ubuntu productions servers?

Linux Mint is basically Ubuntu with a different desktop environment. \n\nAs fart as Ubuntu versions go, an LTS version will be the best. The latest one will be supported the longest. While its been a while since I used Ubuntu (I am currently using Linux Mint 17.2), I have had the most luck with Ubuntu 14.04. \n\nIf you are running an older machine, you should use Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or Ubuntu server. I am using an old desktop machine, and Ubuntu is always having problems on it. The Unity desktop is very resource heavy.\n\nSo, I would probably recommend Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Choosing an LTS version is always the best bet, as they're developed and supported for 5 years, rather than the 9 months of non LTS releases.\nThe most current LTS version is 14.04, although 12.04 is still supported, the next one won't be released until April 2016.\nI favor Ubuntu server editions, as I like to do everything on the command-line and it's less resource heavy, as it doesn't need to run all that graphical stuff!\n", "Q: Possible to backup contents of boot partition, format it and copy contents back to it? I am trying to install Windows 8 on an iMac (mid 2010 model). The iMac already has Ubuntu 14.04 installed on it which I intend to keep. So basically I would like to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 8. (There is no OSX on this machine).\nMy internal HDD has the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI boot partition\n\n*Ext4 partition for Ubuntu\n\n*NTFS partition (empty currently) for Windows 8\n\n*SWAP partition\n\n\nI booted the Windows 8 installation USB and clicked through the Windows 8 installer until I got to the partitioning section.\nAfter selecting the partition on which I want to install Windows 8 (NTFS partition), the installer throws the following error which is German so I have attempted to translate it:\n\nYour EFI partition is not in NTFS format. Try formatting the EFI\n  partition to FAT32\n\nI am sure my EFI partition is in FAT format, but perhaps it is in FAT16 (I originally used the Ubuntu Live CD installer to install Ubuntu on this machine and it created the EFI boot partition so I am not sure what is chosen as standard).\nSo my question is what is the best things to do now in order to be able to install Windows 8?\nIf I change the format of the EFI boot partition then obviously that is going to destry any data on it and then I will not be able to boot into Ubuntu.\nIs there any way to save the contents of the boot partition, then format it and then copy back the contents?\nOr is there a simpler method? Perhaps format the boot partition and then use Boot Repair? Would that work?

Try formatting the EFI partition to FAT32\n\nThis is confusing, since it seems to imply that the Windows installer wants the partition be both NTFS and FAT32 -- an impossibility. In fact, the EFI System Partition (ESP) must be FAT, and Windows wants it to be FAT32. (The EFI spec mentions FAT32 explicitly but also mentions other FAT bit depths elsewhere, so the spec could be clearer.) I suspect the reference to NTFS is either a typo on your part or a bug in the Windows installer, and will proceed under that assumption....\n\nI am sure my EFI partition is in FAT format, but perhaps it is in FAT16 (I originally used the Ubuntu Live CD installer to install Ubuntu on this machine and it created the EFI boot partition so I am not sure what is chosen as standard).\n\nUbuntu's installer will use FAT for the ESP, but which bit depth depends on the partition's size -- or at least, that was the case a few versions ago. You can check the current FAT type by using parted or GParted, as in:\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print\nModel: ATA Samsung SSD 850 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 250GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                 Flags\n 1      524kB   1573kB  1049kB               BIOS boot partition  bios_grub\n 2      1573kB  580MB   579MB   fat32        EFI System           boot\n 3      580MB   1106MB  525MB   ext4         Xubuntu /boot\n 4      1106MB  1631MB  525MB   ext4         Ubuntu /boot         legacy_boot\n 5      1631MB  250GB   248GB                Linux LVM            lvm\n\nAs you can see, this disk's ESP (/dev/sda2) is FAT32.\nIf you find that your ESP is FAT16, then yes, you can back it up, create a fresh FAT32 filesystem on it, and restore it -- at least, assuming it's big enough to hold a FAT32 filesystem (IIRC, the minimum size for a FAT32 filesystem is 32MiB). Note that you'll almost certainly need to update your /etc/fstab entry for the new serial number (incorrectly called a \"UUID\" by most Linux utilities and configuration files, including /etc/fstab). Alternatively, you can check the current serial number (as retrieved from /etc/fstab or detected by blkid) and then pass that as a value to the -i option to mkdosfs to re-use the old number.\n", "Q: CRON jobs sending email, but I didn't configured it I'm always taking a look on the logs to see anything suspicious.

Even if it's not sending an e-mail, is this a normal behaviour of a cron with default configurations?\nThank you guys for helping me.\n\nA: Yes, by default email will be sent either to whatever is specified by the MAILTO variable or to the crontab owner, and that every time there is a cron job output. From the cron(8) man page:\ncron wakes up every minute, examining all stored crontabs, checking each command to see if it should be run in the current minute.  When executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab (or to the user named in the MAILTO environment variable in the crontab, if such exists).\nHowever you seem to have a config problem with postfix/sendmail or, perhaps more precisely, with yr postfix to sendmail compatibility interface. It does not seem to be correctly configured. \nIf you want to understand what the exit status 75 means look this up:\n\nEX_TEMPFAIL A Recoverable Error: The EX_TEMPFAIL exit code (value 75)\n  is returned by sendmail to indicate that a temporary error has\n  occurred. Temporary errors mean that the mail message will be put in\n  (or remain in) the queue for the present, and another delivery attempt\n  will be made later.\n\nTo reconfigure postfix, do, from the cmd line:\n$ dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\nThat ought to solve your problem, provided postfix was correctly installed.\nTo determine the location of the directory that contains your Postfix main.cf and master.cf config files, do, from cmd-line:\n$ postconf config_directory\n\nCheck yr config files out to see that yr configuration is correct.\nFor the sake of completeness, you should know that Postfix has also a log procedure in case config-debugging is needed. On my box (Trusty LTS) its log file is located at /var/log/mail.log. In the log look for keywords as quoted from /usr/share/doc/postfix/DEBUG_README:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"panic\" indicates a problem in the software itself that only a programmer\n  can fix. Postfix cannot proceed until this is fixed.\n  \n*\"fatal\" is the result of missing files, incorrect permissions,\n  incorrect\n  configuration file settings that you can fix. Postfix cannot proceed until\n  this is fixed.\n  \n*\"error\" reports an error condition. For safety reasons, a Postfix\n  process\n  will terminate when more than 13 of these happen.\n  \n*\"warning\" indicates a non-fatal error. These are problems that you\n  may not\n  be able to fix (such as a broken DNS server elsewhere on the network) but\n  may also indicate local configuration errors that could become a problem\n  later.\n\nIf this does not give you what you need to make the problem go away, you'll have to go deeper using debugging tools available to you on Ubuntu to determine where the problem lies. I think that falls outside the scope of yr question. \n", "Q: Isn't it possible to REPLACE IOS BOOTLOADER to install Ubuntu Touch?

You can replace . with your desired folder.\nfind . -type f -name \"*.dat\" -print0 | \\\n    xargs -0 awk 'NR==1 {header=$_} FNR==1 && NR!=1 { $_ ~ $header getline; } {print}' > out\n\nor, as getline is bad (thx @fedorqui)\nfind . -type f -name \"*.dat\" -exec awk 'NR==1 || FNR!=1' {} + ;\n\n\nExample\n% cat foo1.dat \na   b   c\n1   2   3\n\n% cat foo2.dat\na   b   c\n4   5   6\n\n% awk 'NR==1 {header=$_} FNR==1 && NR!=1 { $_ ~ $header getline; } {print}' *.dat > out\n\n% cat out \na   b   c\n1   2   3\n4   5   6\n\n\nA: You can use a while loop that gets fed by a find through process substitution:\nd=0\nwhile IFS= read -r file\ndo\n   [ \"$d\" -ge 1 ] && tail -n +2 \"$file\" || cat \"$file\"\n   (( d ++ ))\ndone < <(find \"/dir/folder\" name *.dat)\n\nSo it will perform a cat on the first match and tail -n +2 on the rest.\n\nAlternatively, if you have all the files in the same dir you can say:\nawk 'FNR>1 || NR==1' files*\n\nThis will match everything but the case when FNR==1 and NR>1, that is, everything but the header of the files after the first one. Why? Because NR holds the number of line being read overall, whereas FNR holds the number of line of the current file being read.\n", "Q: Adobe Reader XI opening file problem I have the following error message in AR XI :\n\nThere was an error opening this document.

The SSD has only got about 4GB of space left, and I don't really want to delete anything to make space for Ubuntu so I want to install it on the 1TB hard drive. I know that in order to do this I will have to change the boot order each time I want to switch OSes, but I don't really mind since I won't be using Ubuntu as much as Windows anyway. I've got a lot of data on the 1TB hard drive, about 850GB, but there should be enough for Ubuntu.\nMy question though, is if I can just make a new partition on this drive and install Ubuntu to it, without erasing any other data. If I can, can I, like I specified, also just change the OS I want to use by simply changing the boot order? Sorry if this has been asked before, but most of the answers I could find were about installing it to an empty second hard drive, whereas I would like to keep the data on mine.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can create partitions on your HDD without erasing any data if there is enough space.\nYou can boot from Ubuntu LiveUSB, start gparted and do it there.\nYou will not need to change boot order in bios.\nYou can install grub on SSD or HDD, that will provide boot menu, where you will be able to choose which OS to start.\nIf you install grub on HDD, then when HDD is the first boot option, you will have that menu. If you switch boot order to SSD, you will boot right into Windows.\n", "Q: Check the health of my SSD I want to check the status of my ssd under Ubuntu 14.04 so I use these commands:\nsmartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Media_Wearout_Indicator\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda\n\nand this is the output:\nsmartctl 6.2 2013-07-26 r3841 [x86_64-linux-3.13.0-57-generic] (local build)\nCopyright (C) 2002-13, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org\n\n=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===\nModel Family:     SandForce Driven SSDs\nDevice Model:     KINGSTON SV300S37A120G\nSerial Number:    50026B774200F2E6\nLU WWN Device Id: 5 0026b7 74200f2e6\nFirmware Version: 521ABBF0\nUser Capacity:    120.034.123.776 bytes [120 GB]\nSector Size:      512 bytes logical/physical\nRotation Rate:    Solid State Device\nDevice is:        In smartctl database [for details use: -P show]\nATA Version is:   ATA8-ACS, ACS-2 T13/2015-D revision 3\nSATA Version is:  SATA 3.0, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 3.0 Gb/s)\nLocal Time is:    Mon Aug  3 16:03:14 2015 CEST\nSMART support is: Available -

When systemd is running as a system instance, then everything is, by default, run as root. When systemd is running as a user instance, then everything is run as the user that started the systemd instance. In addition, a limited set of variables are set for services started. For the system instance, only LANG and PATH are set by default (at least on Ubuntu 15.04). For the user instance, in addition to the previous variables, HOME, LOGNAME, SHELL, and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR are set.\nIn your case, based on the output of the process, the process is meant to be run under a user's account, not as root. The proper fix would be to move the service file to either /etc/systemd/user or ~/.config/systemd/user, so that the service would be started under the user's systemd.\n", "Q: Admin Account Missing after 'shutdown now' Exit So, I have been learning PostgreSQL and messing around with creating DB's, users, and switching between both with Konsole. Last night, I shut down the computer with the command 'shutdown now'. After a while, the session appeared to have logged out and hung at a blank, black screen. After viewing this for a few moments, I think that something is wrong and go to turn off the computer using a hard shutdown.

I was wondering if ubuntu will ever be able to keep itself updated without user interaction like chrome boxes and iOS. I heard windows 10 is planning to be like this as well. Not sure if it would be practical for the ubuntu community. For instance my 14.04 automatically updating to the next LTS without my needing to approve anything. :D\n\nA: Forcing updates is a bad idea. What if one doesn't work well with someones system, what if they have a really important deadline and the install screws up, blocking them from their PC until they sort it? Forcing updates introduces a lack of control.\nWith a standard configuration updates are only a click away. With the standard update manager, security updates can be set to be automatic. For automating more upgrades you can use the unattended-upgrades package, with control over which packages update. Perhaps one day unattended-upgrades will have a nice GUI which to my knowledge it doesn't yet.\nAs for actually doing distro-upgrades that is the sort of thing you really want to ask people about first. Are you happy with your GUI changing, some packages perhaps not being supported, and a really the update taking a long time? But still that can be only a click away.\n\nA: Ubuntu supports automatic installation of minor software updates.  My install notes say to run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades\n\nand \"select the 'yes' option\" (you may need to install it, but my experience is that it is already installed, so you just need to reconfigure it).  I believe that only handles security updates, but more detailed config is available in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.\nAs far as automatic release-upgrades, (e.g. between 12.04 and 14.04), I'll echo others' statements that you probably don't want to do those automatically.  Those actually often break and change things (even for just simple GUI use).  For server use, you damn well want to make sure the new system works when that happens; for \"older relative\" use, it's probably good to be on-hand to do any tech support that might be needed - do you remember how significantly the UI changed from 10.04 to 12.04?  Besides, you really only want LTS releases in that case, and those only happen once every 2 years!\n\nA: Forcing updates without permmision is a terrible idea, it would result in ( anyway i think) 90 percent of the ubuntu population being very frustrated, ubuntu is built for the user, not the company to make money\n", "Q: IBus avro Bangla writing problem in libre office I've properly installed iBus-avro and libre office on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but whenever I type words like 'সদস্য' or 'প্রিয়' it actually gets typed as 'সদস' and 'পরয়'.

The ~/.bashrc file is sourced for non-login interactive shells (and also for login interactive shells, sourced from ~/.profile). The main point is interactivity.\nThe ~/.bashrc file has the following snippet at the start :\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nThis means check the shell options by $-, if the shell is not interactive (no i flag), exit from ~/.bashrc file.\nSo as you are spawning a non-interactive shell via bash -c, the PATH you have set at the end won't be read.\nYou have few options :\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the -i option of bash so that bash behaves as an interactive shell and reads the ~/.bashrc file :\n/usr/bin/sudo -H -u <user> /bin/bash -i -c '<command>'\n\n\n*As you were using the -l option which tells bash to behave as a login shell, you can put the PATH in ~/.profile so that it will be source-ed. Note that this might not a good option considering your need.\n\n*Another very very bad option would be to put PATH at the very start of the ~/.bashrc file, before the interactivity check snippet. \n", "Q: Choosing ubuntu version for 10 year old pc I am going to install Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS (Lucid Lynx) on my 10 year old pc. So should I have to install by Desktop CD or Server install CD? And what happens to my partitions while installing Ubuntu in my winxp pc permanently?\n\nA: For a system with 512 MB of RAM I can only recommend distros with lightweight desktop environment (DE), such as Lubuntu, that sports LXDE (where L stands for Lightweight). It's preferable to install rather newer versions of OS as it usually supports more hardware. So I would recommend Lubuntu 14.04 LTS (Long Term Support = till 2019, but you can upgrade every two years) or something similar like PeppermintOS 5/6 (both based on 14.04). There is also WattOS with LXDE based on 14.04 and they have even some \"Microwatt\" edition for even slower, older PCs.\nOther lightweight DE choices include fluxbox, various tiling like xmonad, ratpoison, awesome etc. But if you want something more familiar LXDE is probably the best first choice.\nLastly I'd like to mention that elementaryOS Luna is quite lightweight actually although it's build on older Ubuntu base (12.04). Too bad this is not true for their new version Freya, which didn't run properly even on Atom netbook with 1 GB RAM. Still Luna is supported till April 2017 so you might give it a try too.\n\nA: Hey there!\n10.04 comes with an application called Gparted. You can use it to manage partitions from the live media. So I think live installation is your best bet, plus you get to test the waters of Ubuntu on your old hardware first. Also a prompt will appear when you install 10.04 that asks you to partition your HD with gparted, so at some point during the live CD installation, you will run into gparted. \nThere is also the option of backing up all of your XP files and software and running it in a virtual machine, if you have your XP installation media. This way you can keep XP in ubuntu. I'd post an image of how to's but this is my first post. \nIn my opinion, go with LXDE or Xubuntu so you can have recent software on your old hardware. Its awesome. But 10.04 isn't too bad if you know how to manage your packages but not much support will be available. \n", "Q: drivers of wireless usb adpter bl-wn151 please help me!!!\nI HAVE AN CD OF DRIVER OF MY USB ADPTER, THERE IS A FOLDER OF LINUX IN IT BUT DONT KNOW TO INSTALL???\nTHE FULL CONFIGURATION OF MY USB WIRELESS ADAPTER IS ON:::\nwww.lb-link.cn/index.php/download/view?cid=195\nThe output of lsusb is\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. \n\n\nA: Run these commands in terminal.

This tells you how to password protect your GRUB boot menu to restrict access to specific operations or boot variants. It contains a small example.\n\nA: Grub allows you to password protect its config and console, as well as individual operating system entries. Please note that this will not stop dedicated individuals, especially the ones that know what they are doing. But I assume you know that. Lets get started.  \ngenerate a password hash..\nYou could store your grub password in plain text but that is entirely insecure and anyone that had access to your account could quickly figure it out. To prevent this we hash the password using the grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command, like so:  \nuser@host~ % grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2\nEnter password: \nReenter password: \nPBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.63553D205CF6E...  \n\nWhile you type your password no characters will show in the terminal, this is to prevent people looking over your shoulders, etc. Now, copy the entirety of your hash with Ctrl+Shift+C.  \nprotecting the config, console..\nRun:\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom  \n\nThis will create a new configuration file called 40_custom in grub's configuration directory. Now add the lines:  \nset superusers=\"username\"  \npassword_pbkdf2 username hash  \n\nWhere username is a username of your choice and hash is the hash we generated in the last command. Press Ctrl+O and then Ctrl+X to save and quit. Run:\nsudo update-grub  \n\nTo finalize the changes. Now, when anyone attempts to edit the grub configuration or access a grub console it will prompt them for a username and password.  \npassword protecting operating system entries..\nCurrently the only method to achieve this I can find is to edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually. This is only temporary however as any new kernel update will rewrite this file and your passwords will be gone (note that this doesn't effect the console/editing password we set above). All other methods I have found so far are extremely out of date and I can no longer get them to work.  \nI've asked the grub mailing list if there is a newer method and will edit this answer as soon as I find out.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu forget the install state of a package?

I have a bq Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition phone, and want to set up printing to my HP wireless printer, connected to my local Wifi network.\nWith my computer running Linux (currently Debian) I am used to use cups, with some graphical interface, but I have found nothing like this on my phone.\nIs it possible at all to setup printing on Ubuntu Touch?\n\nA: Using your PC, you can enable your printer through your Google account as a \"cloud printer\", and then you can print email attachments from your phone.\n\nA: Well, there's actually a quite tricky solution using your Ubuntu Phone as a cups client. But be carefully following the instructions! If you're not sure about, what you're doing, you may brake your phone (by software) because the following method uses apt, which is expressly not recommended for use on any Ubuntu Touch devices.\nAnyway, install Libertine on your phone (indeed working on E4.5 already) executing the instructions from this article on Libertine and create a container. The easiest way to do this is the Libertine app (should appear as a black hat icon after installation) in the App Scope.\nAfter this install the package 'system-config-printer-gnome' in the container. If this doesn't work via the app, use the install command in this ubuntuusers.de article (in German, sorry). This will install all for printing necessary packages including cups.\nThen create the directory .cups in /home/phablet/.local/share/libertine-container/user-data/NAMEOFCONTAINER/ and in the new directory you create the file client.conf. In this file you enter the following:\nServerName 192.168.2.3\n\nReplace the IP by yours or by the hostname of your cups server. Congrats! You now should see the shared printers from your cups server and be able to print from them from all Libertine(!) apps like LibreOffice (install it if not yet done).\nBy the way: Scanning is also possible. Just install simple-scan in your container and attach the IP or HostName of your configured SANE server to the file /home/phablet/.cache/libertine-container/NAMEOFCONTAINER/rootfs/etc/sane.d/net.conf.\n", "Q: After updating 12.04 to 14.04 or newer on my Laptop Dell XPS14Z a button 'eject' on keyboard has stopped working Laptop has a button on the keyboard to eject CD-ROM like on Mac. It works fine on 12.04, but no longer on newer versions. Laptops has sold with the Windows. \nThe distribution of Ubuntu 12.04 has been taken from the official site ubuntu.com. Is it possible to fix the button in the new version of Ubuntu? The command 'eject' working in the terminal on all versions.\n\nA: just create a custom keyboard shortcut\nGo to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and add a custom keyboard \nshortcut running the command 'eject'.  Then assign that shortcut to the \nkey on your laptop.\nIf somehow you have multiple ejectable drives, you'll have to specify in \nthe command like 'eject /dev/cdromX'.  If you've only one drive, just \n'eject' should work.\n\nA: The this problem has disappeared samself after the upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 and in Ubuntu 18.04 the \"Eject\" button also works correctly.\n", "Q: File chooser view settings In Ubuntu 14.04 with GNOME 3.10, replaced every shred of nautilus with pcmanfm 1.2.3.  Searched through every config file, checked the issue tracker, nothing can seem to explain how I can force the file chooser / save as / open dialog to show files in a compact view (or any view other than the one-column detail listing).\nPart of the problem is I just don't know what the underlying process is for this in general - nautilus somehow?  pcmanfm?  gnome-shell?  gdm?  X?!\n\nHere is an example of the compact view\n\n\nA: As found in my quick research online, particularly from this answer on another askubuntu.com question, the file chooser and save as dialogues are related to the graphical toolkit upon which an application is built, and in no way related to default file manager. Since most programs use gtk toolkit under Ubuntu, I see no possible way of altering those dialogues. There's possibility of switching to Qt-based desktops, but at least in my experience under razorqt that didn't do the trick. Therefore my answer to this question is altering file dialogues is impossible. There's other, more experienced users that me, hence perhaps there might be other answer, so my answer isn't conclusive\n", "Q: need help for booting menu after installation of ubuntu I have installed Ubuntu alongside windows 8 successfully but when i restart the machine the boot loader is not going for the option for either Ubuntu or windows 8 .

It all downloaded but the last  some Kb  is not. Can I burn that much and will it install properly  .\n\nA: An incompletely downloaded Ubuntu iso file is not guaranteed to install properly. Next time use wget -c from the terminal to download the Ubuntu iso. wget with the -c (continue) option will continue the download automatically from the place where it was interrupted until the download is finished. wget is such a powerful program that it will even continue the download from the same place where it was interrupted, if you restart the download from a different mirror. wget is often a lot faster than a torrent depending on the relative download speeds of the mirror and the torrent.  \nIf you are using Windows, the DownThemAll! add-on for Firefox also has the continue functionality.\n\nA: You need the whole file of course to do an install\nFirst choice, try again later, could be a server issue.\nBetter choice is to change the download type, try the torrent version, should not have this issue with that.\nOn the same page as above you can also find alternative mirrors, pick one near you and then choose the version you would like.\n\nA: Not really. If you have downloaded the ISO, you should check the hash if it is completed or not. Its better to use torrent. You can do a thing, download .torrent file and point the file location to the one you downloaded earlier. It will check the file and then complete the missing bytes. Then you can install Ubuntu using that ISO. :)\nThere are step-by-step instructions for how to continue an interrupted direct download from a torrent at this answer. This works with Transmission, the default BitTorrent client in Ubuntu.\n\nA: You will likely encounter problem with corrupted iso image.

Ubuntu is an operating system depending highly on an internet connection being present. Your best method would be to connect the system to the internet and upgrade through that.\nIf the server is important to be up and running asap all other methods will be risky and will consume a lot of time. \nThere is a tool called \"apt-offline\" where you use an internet connection from a remote system to download packages. It can be used to upgrade BUT the list it generates is based on the system the command it run so you will need another system that is similar and does have an internet connection. So that defeats the purpose: if that is a workable method you could just attach that server you want upgraded to the web.\n\nWe tend to NOT upgrade.

If I try to install them it says the latest version is already installed. \nAlso tried restarting xserver thinking, there is now way it is not installed, how else could it crash, with sudo service lightdm restart which left me with a black screen. After restarting, there was no xserver crash error but I still can't use vgaswitcheroo.

Installing Ubuntu OpenStack requires at least five machines with two disks, two of which have two network interfaces (NICs). Install Ubuntu Server on one of the machines with two interfaces.\nWhy do I need two disks? What if I have 5 machines with 2TB capacity each but on a single disk? Would this setup not work i:e http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack? Why do we need 2 interfaces on two machines? I understand for one machine, one interface connects to the internet and the second to the local network. But why do we need 2 interfaces for the second machine?\n\nA: Multiple disks are required because the OpenStack configuration deployed by the Autopilot co-locates the Nova Compute service and Ceph on the same nodes. This results in one disk being used for system boot, and one being allocated to the Ceph OSD for data storage.\nYou get scale-out storage and scale-out compute in the bargain, but you need two disks. \nYou could substitute USB keys for the second drive...

When I try to start or restart the service, this is successful - it just writes the new pid to the pid file. Why isn't the pid file removed when the service is properly stopped?\n\nA: Actually start-stop-daemon is not supposed to remove pidfiles. You can do it in your script (rm -f $pidfile). You might want to take a look at some other start script. The script /etc/init.d/dbus for example has the following shutdown script (for do stop):\nshut_it_down()\n{\n  log_daemon_msg \"Stopping $DESC\" \"$NAME\"\n  start-stop-daemon --stop --retry 5 --quiet --oknodo --pidfile $PIDFILE \\\n    --user $DAEMONUSER\n  # We no longer include these arguments so that start-stop-daemon\n  # can do its job even given that we may have been upgraded.\n  # We rely on the pidfile being sanely managed\n  # --exec $DAEMON -- --system $PARAMS\n  log_end_msg $?\n  rm -f $PIDFILE\n}\n\nFrom the manual page:\n\n-m, --make-pidfile\n                Used when starting a program that does not create  its  own  pid\n                file.  This  option  will make start-stop-daemon create the file\n                referenced with --pidfile and place the pid into it just  before\n                executing  the  process. Note, the file will not be removed when\n                stopping the program.  NOTE: This feature may not  work  in  all\n                cases.  Most  notably when the program being executed forks from\n                its main process. Because of this, it  is  usually  only  useful\n                when combined with the --background option.\n\n(see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/start-stop-daemon.8.html)\n", "Q: shell sript to read source file and use the key in the script #!/bin/bash\nsource /data/output/QAScripts/conf.ini\nvar=$($1path)\necho $var\n\n\nconf.ini is the config file which has LSTpath=/data/bb/loader\nI get below below error.

And I want to do it through terminal. Is that possible? Because I have a slow internet connection. \nI'm using Ubuntu 15.04 with a GNOME desktop environment. \n\nA: To upgrade only Firefox from the terminal type:  \nsudo apt upgrade firefox  \n\nThe above command works without the --only-upgrade option. If your Firefox is already the latest version the command will not install any new package, and you will get the following message:  \nfirefox is already the newest version.\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get install firefox\n\nthis will only upgrade firefox to the newest version.\nfor details, use man apt-get and go to install section :\ninstall\n\nThis is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or more already-installed packages without upgrading every package you have on your system. \n  Unlike the \"upgrade\" target, which installs the newest version of all currently installed packages, \"install\" will install the newest version of only the package(s) specified. \n  Simply provide the name of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a newer version is available, it (and its dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded and installed.\n\n\nA: To only upgrade Firefox on its own do:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade firefox\n\nor\nsudo apt-get upgrade firefox\n\n\nfrom man apt-get\nupgrade\n    upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n    currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n    /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions\n    available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are\n    currently installed packages removed, or packages not already\n    installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently\n    installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the\n    install status of another package will be left at their current\n    version. An update must be performed first so that apt-get knows\n    that new versions of packages are available.\n\ndist-upgrade\n    dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also\n    intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of\n    packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it\n    will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of\n    less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may\n    therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file\n    contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n    files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the\n    general settings for individual packages.\n\n\nA: You can update an application by using the command line using the following command:\n$ sudo apt upgrade <app name>\n\nIf there is no update in the system’s repositories, follow this steps:\nYou can install Snap package manager to install new applications releases.\nTo install it, follow this command:\n$ sudo apt install snapd\n\nThen you can install applications from it by this command:\n$ sudo snap install <app name>\n\nNote: that not all applications are present in it.\nthe applications are always the latest releases\nSnap site is at in these URL:\nhttps://snapcraft.io/store\nAnd to inquire about Snap's orders, use command:\n$ man snap\n\n", "Q: bash - can shellcode be made from a bash script? I was thinking it can't, since there's not really a binary for bash scripts, but having to write a C program every time you need to generate shell code for a single command is just a pain. \n\nA: You can use programs from metasploit to generate shellcode.\nHere's an example using msfpayload to do so:\nhttp://www.hacking-tutorial.com/tips-and-trick/generate-a-shellcode-using-msfpayload-metasploit-command-line-instance/\n\nA: This is now possible thanks to my new malware tool\ngit clone https://github.com/Radicalware/Malware_Tools \nIt does exactly what you asked for.\nIt also works to make Windows shellcode as well as Linux/OSX.\nThis is NOT like metasploit/shellsploit which generate shellcodes and only taylor them to your needs (ip,port,username,etc), my tool actually allows you to CREATE your own shellcodes from scratch!!!\n", "Q: heavy write to disk activity as soon as I turn on computer Can someone tell me if something nefarious is going on?\nI recently had to wipe my drive (losing all my data) and do a reinstall.

If you \"just turn it off\" during this process, the disk state gets worse. Repeat enough times, and your system will fail.  \nSuggestion:  \nReboot your computer. Note the (computer) time  \nHit \"/\" or \"F12\" (I cannot recall which, offhand, try each) to see boot messages.  \nWatch the messages.  \nAllow the disk activity to complete.  \nLook at the log entries in /var/log/{kern.log,syslog,boot,boot.log,bootstrap.log,dmesg} with time/date fields after the time of reboot noted above.

I installed the separate installation files from their official website. I followed this thread here. (The top answer) \nThe steps helped me install the Java IDE but I don't know what changes I should make to the procedure to install the C/C++ IDE. \nAnother thread here, recommended to install eclipse-cdt but the Eclipse version installed is outdated. (Doesn't allow me to install Pydev) \nI have TWO questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the C/C++ libraries be downloaded from within eclipse, like Pydev?\n\n*If not, how do I install both IDEs without interfering with each other?\nP.S. I commented this query in the first thread but got no reply, that is why I'm asking a fresh question!  \n\nA: Your first question\nNo, you can't download the C/C++ libraries from within eclipse, like Pydev.\n\nYour second question\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Eclipse JEE and Eclipse C/C++ in separate folders in /opt eg: \n/opt/eclipse-cpp\n/opt/eclipse-jee\n\n\n*Create two different desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/eclipse_cpp.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse C++\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=/opt/eclipse-cpp/eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse-CPP\n\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/eclipse_jee.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse JEE\nComment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=/opt/eclipse-jee/eclipse\nStartupNotify=true\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse-Java\n\n\n\n*During the first start of both Eclipse distributions, select a different workspace folder for each of them, eg\nworkspace-cpp\nworkspace-jee\n\nAlternatively you can change the workspace folder in Eclipse itself via File > Switch Workspace\nNow you can use both distributions in parallel.\n\n\nA: You can install eclipse from the software center and then open the terminal and type:  \nsudo apt-get install eclipse eclipse-cdt g++  \n\n\nA: A better way to do it is to use umake because you'll get the very latest build. sudo apt install will only get you the build that's currently available from the repository, which could be surprisingly old.\nTo install umake: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make  \nsudo apt update  \nsudo apt install ubuntu-make  \n\nThen to get eclipse (2018/19) at the moment:\numake ide eclipse\n\nFor java EE:\numake ide eclipse-jee\n\nFor C/C++:\numake ide eclipse-cpp\n\nFor PHP:\numake ide eclipse-php\n\nhttp://linuxhackr.com/eclipse-ide-on-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Sound by application controls Are there any easy GUI controls that I can get access to which will allow me to set specific sound levels on certain specified applications in Ubuntu GNOME 15.04, running GNOME Shell, and GNOME 3.14?\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\n\nA: Using pavucontrol\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\n\n\nOr start Sound via your Activities menu\n\n", "Q: Is there a boot option to modify key repeat behavior?

The only solution is to force shut down the computer.\nIs there anything that can be done to prevent this?\nI have googled this but i haven't found any solution yet. \n\nA: A couple of ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type Ctrl-Alt-F1. This should bring you to a terminal (non-graphics) console with a login prompt. You should be able to login here, sudo to root and look at log files under /var/log. This way you may be able to determine exactly what is happening.\n\n*You may also be able to set the power options by going to System Settings -> Power, and selecting what happens when you close the lid. You can get to System Settings by doing a search in dash (in the launcher, left side of the screen), or by directly clicking on the power meter at the top right of the screen.\n\n", "Q: 'apt-get update' gets stuck for hours at \"100% [Working]\" for specific PPA When I run sudo apt-get update on Ubuntu 15.04, I get the following (shortened) output:\n$ LANG=C sudo apt-get update\n[sudo] password for ipc-admin: \nIgn http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de vivid InRelease\nIgn http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de vivid-updates InRelease\n.\n.\n.\nHit http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de vivid-proposed/universe Translation-en\nHit http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de vivid-proposed/universe Translation-de\n100% [Working]\n\nThen it gets stuck and won't continue until I interrupt it with Ctrl+C.\nWhen I do sudo aptitude update instead, it also hangs at the same position.\nAfter deleting the cache with sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists and running sudo apt-get update again, I still get the same results.\nHowever, it seems to have successfully updated the package index files after running sudo apt-get update and interrupting it when it gets stuck, as I still can run apt-get upgrade and receive new updates, or apt-get install.

I am running Xubuntu 15.04, but maybe this question has a general solution for all Ubuntu flavours. \nI usually leave long computations running in a terminal window, which may take from a couple of minutes, to hours, or days. It would be nice if I could be alerted somehow when a terminal finishes executing a command. This should only be necessary for terminals which are minimized. \nIs there a way to set up something like this? Ideally, the terminal window could flash, or maybe a notification show up.\n\nA: I suggest using libnotify's notify-send for notifications. I've created the following script to do this:\n#!/bin/bash\n$1 && \\\nnotify-send -u critical -i info 'Command execution finished' \"The command '$1' terminated successfully\" || \\\nnotify-send -u critical 'Command execution failed' \"The command '$1' exited with errors\"\n\nIf you save above script in a file called e.g. nexec and make it executable using chmod +x nexec, and move the program to a directory in your shells PATH variable, (e.g. /usr/local/bin/), you can run any command with\nnexec 'long-time-command some arguments'\n\nE.g.\nnexec 'sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'\n\nlibnotify will (at least it does so on my system, I assume this can differ between different desktops) display notifications marked as 'critical' until they are being dismissed manually (e.g. by clicking on them). As you can take from the code, you will receive a different notification if the command returns a non-zero result.\n\nA: Have you ever heard of undistract-me?

To install it for python 3 i believe you have to use the python3 pip instead of the python2 pip, i read that somewhere but im not sure if its correct, does the python3 pip know to get the correct connector or do you have to specify the specific version like 'pip install mysql-connector1.2'.\nanyways, i was finding it difficult to get the py3 pip, then i came across a post advising the use of 'virtualenv' to make it easier to work with different versions of python.

I dont know if im doing something wrong. Any suggestions? As the os im installing can only be installed by usb. \nI have tried the lili program, wind32 disk imager, and a few others, im just not sure what to do at this point. Thank you\n\nA: First, make sure the image was downloaded correctly by checksum comparison. To do this, you need (a) the MD5 hash of the Ubuntu image you downloaded and (b) a MD5 checksum computer for Windows, e.g. WinMD5.\nShould the sums not match, the image was downloaded incorrectly. This can happen easily. Redownload the image in this case. I recommend using the BitTorrent download, as the BitTorrent protocol already does checksum comparisons while downloading. If a chunk is transmitted wrongly, it is requested again and not the whole file needs to be re-downloaded, which makes the download both safer and faster.\nSecond, if your computers indeed support booting from USB, ensure that the USB Legacy Emulation (or something of that kind) option is disabled in the computer's BIOS setup, if this option even exists.\nIf your computer doesn't support booting from USB, use a boot loader that supports it, like PLOP Boot Manager, burned on a CD (PLOP even fits on a floppy, if anyone remembers those) and boot the USB via such a boot loader.\nIf indeed only the creation of the bootstick fails, try another utility, such as UnetBootin or PendriveLinux. I've experienced the first one to work very well (at least on my Linux box) and heard mostly positive things about the second one.\n", "Q: Who do I install PHP Blenc on Ubuntu 14?

Follow instruction in that file in order to edit information. Save changes and launch the configure script.\n./configure \nmake \nmake install\n\nNow you have to edit your /etc/php5/cli/php.ini configuration, adding at the end of file directives to load BLENC extension.\n; BLENC PHP Extension\nextension=blenc.so\n\nHere is my source with more details on further features\n\nA: From http://php.net/manual/en/intro.blenc.php, just to have said it:\n\nWarning This extension is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this extension including the names of its functions and any other documentation surrounding this extension may change without notice in a future release of PHP. This extension should be used at your own risk.\n\n\nFirst, of course, you need PHP to be installed. I'll assume you already did this. Now, the guys from BLENC recommend not to use the easy method, so I'll skip that:\n\nIt's strongly recommended to install BLENC from sources without 'pecl' command. In this way you can:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Specify your personal encryption key used to create redistributable keys. Your sourcecode will be more difficult to decrypt also for users that can read your key_file on webserver.\n  \n*Specify a expiration date for the BLENC module. With expiration date you can decide that BLENC module on target system will work until a date. After that BLENC will not decrypt any files.\n  \n  \n  All these configuration options are stored into header file: blenc_protect.h\n  Please read the content of blenc_protect.h in sources of BLENC to know how set these hardcoded options.\n\nThe 'hard way' (and recommended one) is to build the extension from source:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the php5-dev package: sudo apt-get install php5-dev\n\n*Download BLENC's source from here\n\n*Extract the downloaded archive, open a terminal and cd into the directory with the extracted files\n\n*Run the following commands, as from this instruction. Before you do so, heed the recommendation from the authors and have a look at blenc_protect.h and do whatever it says in there, if you wish to do so.\nphpize\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n*The compiled module will automatically be moved to the correct directory. All left to do is to activate it by adding\nextension=php_blenc.so\n\nto your php.ini file. I think you'll notice in case the actual name is different. The default setup should now be concluded.\n", "Q: Menus and Software Center in Chinese I recently dual booted Ubuntu version 15.04 alongside Windows 10 on my Dell Inspiron 3451.

I'm wondering if there is anything like macchanger or what commands/configuration we can use to change/spoof the IMEI on touch phones.\n\nA: It's possible to loose your IMEI on Android phones and Ubuntu phones are not much different (1, 2), but how did you come up with the idea that changing your IMEI or MAC will result in any kind of increased privacy?\nChanging your IMEI to that of another user or an invalid one may actually make your phone look more suspicious and may even lower your privacy, get you blacklisted by the operator or subject to investigation by law enforcement. You are underrating what ever entity you are trying to hide from or are concerned about (1, 2). Modifying some technical thing that you probably don't really understand what it's for and how it's actually being used doesn't change the fact that you are trying to use a product intended to be most useful to you if it knows as much about you as possible.\nYou should also have realized that your phone connects to a network that someone else operates and that you have no control over. You are just a participant. Even though the device is running Ubuntu it also runs closed source software called the baseband or radio image on Android (1, 2) which is responsible for communicating to the network. There is no way in this model to establish trust from the user perspective and therefore no reasonable expectation of privacy for a user when connecting to and communicating in mobile networks. Changing the IMEI won't change anything.\nUsing strong encryption while it is legal or available (1, 2, 3) may make it more difficult for a certain period of time but not impossible of being eavesdropped (1, 2).\nIf you didn't get the news: There are several agencies from a wide variety of countries working together analyzing every user of every network with all the solutions they currently have at their disposal or they just store the data for later. If spying on citizens is illegal in your country, no problem another countries' agency is stupid willing enough to help out and bypass laws.

I am bit confused as in terminal window I typed xterm in Ubuntu it simply opened new terminal window xterm but was doing the same work as the default.\nAnd its also mentioned this terminal is for the X Window.\nBut when I am typing window commands its not working. What I am missing. Please guide.\n\nA: The xterm package has been around since before the original days of X Window, a popular display server. \nxterm doesn’t require many resources (such as memory) to operate. Because of this, the xterm package is still popular in Linux distributions designed to run on older hardware. \nIt can also emulate older terminals, such as  VT102,VT220, and Tektronix 4014 terminals (these are the terminals used in 1980-1990's).\nTo emulate VT100 terminal ,simply type\nxterm -ti vt100\n\n\nA: By definition xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. Since Ubuntu by default relies on X11 graphical server for any graphics - that's why xterm comes with Ubuntu. Now, unless you manually change it, both default terminal and xterm should run your bash shell, which is what actually interprets commands. Without shell, terminal emulator is basically not going to work. \nxterm actually is the original terminal emulator and many modern emulators strive to emulate its functionality and extend it.\n", "Q: Not able to find the pages after running Node server on Ubuntu I am not able to get the pages even if my node server is also running.Please take a look on the below snap shot.\n\nAfter running the server when i typed the ip address and port number i.e-8888 in browser's address bar the pages are not coming.It is showing the message This webpage is not available ERR_CONNECTION_RESET.Please help me to resolve this.\n\nA: I guess you did not have the make tools available when you installed your mongodb library.

I want to use windows for gaming and ubuntu for everything else. The specs for my machine are here http://pcpartpicker.com/p/KvRjMp. \nWindows 10 is installed just fine using a dvd. I have successfully installed ubuntu 14.04 on my old laptop with no issues using a live-dvd. Using the same live-dvd on my new desktop seems to get the best results but still does not work. When it loads it gets to the purple screen with the symbols at the bottom. Then it turns black with _ flashing in the top left. A second or two later I can hear the little bongo roll sound that happens when it loads up but it just hangs with the flashing _. This leads me to believe it's a graphics issue with my gtx 970 but I don't really know anything.\nI have also tried using a live-usb created with the startup-disk tool created with the old laptop with ubuntu on it. This produces the exact same result as using the dvd. I also tried using unetbootin and wubi to no avail.

What should I install? Just the regular Ubuntu or maybe MATE? I don't know the differences in any of these.... please help!\n\nA: I would recommend either Linux Mint or Ubuntu. Before an year, I was a Windows user and tried several versions of Linux. I found Linux Mint as the easiest one, since it comes with most of the codecs and applications by default. Also it's user interface is easy to learn for Windows users. Once you fall in love with Linux (It may take some time, but definitely you will) you can try other distributions and go with your preferred one. (My current OS is Ubuntu 14.04, because of my personal taste.)\nA friendly advice dear, don't start with a Linux version which is designed for some special purposes like for hacking or lightweight for old hardware.\n\nA: They are both good choices and both fully functional. Ubuntu MATE is arguably lighter for older hardware but beyond that your question is too subjective to answer. It's a matter of taste.\nMy recommendation is to try them both out in live environments so you can see with  a minimum of fuss which you prefer.\n", "Q: How to add user level environment variables to be used by GUI application?

I burned the Ubuntu ISO to a DVD and booted my PC from there. Prior to this, I shrunk my Windows C: Partition by 28 GB, leaving enough unallocated space for Ubuntu. During installation though, I did not see an \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option as I expected to, but rather just two options: \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" and \"Something else\". \nFollowing some online instructions, I chose the \"Something else\" option. I created 4 partitions from apparently \"free space\" (although my Windows partition was located there): One for the operating system itself, another for my data, one as a swap area, and lastly a 20 MB partition for BIOS bootloader (I was unsure about this).\nUbuntu installed fine, but after restarting my computer, it booted directly into Ubuntu, without displaying the GRUB bootloader menu that I expected.\nAs my machine started I entered \"Boot Options\" only to find this had nothing to do with operating systems.\nUsing my Windows 7 laptop, I created a system repair disc and booted my computer from it. Strangely it displayed an error message that the disc \"was not compatible with my version of Windows.\" This does not make sense as both my desktop and laptop are 64-bit versions of Windows 7.\nI could also only access the F8 Windows Startup Repair menu when booting from the system repair disc.\nI have all my files on Windows 7, and it is critical that I am able to recover this operating system. Any help at all would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\nA: My Hypothesis\nI'm 95% certain that you've accidentally trashed your Windows installation. Evidence:\n\nFollowing some online instructions, I chose the \"Something else\" option. I created 4 partitions from apparently \"free space\" (although my Windows partition was located there)\n\nThe \"Something Else\" option shows the disk and all current partitions. If it misidentified the disk as being empty when in fact there were current partitions, then you could easily trash your installation in this way. In fact, there's a known bug in libparted (upon which the Ubuntu installer's partitioner is based) that causes it to show the disk as empty when the partition table deviates from absolute perfection. The most likely explanation is that you started with a GPT disk but installed Windows in BIOS mode, which would have caused a GPT-to-MBR conversion that left some GPT data intact. This confuses libparted, resulting in the \"blank disk\" problem. See this page of mine for details and a fix (which will no longer work for you -- by setting up new partitions, you're long past the point where it can be fixed).\nIncidentally, I tried looking for a bug report about this on Launchpad (Ubuntu's bug-tracker), but didn't find one, which is surprising. Perhaps I'll investigate further and file a bug report, since this problem is so serious.\n\nUbuntu installed fine, but after restarting my computer, it booted directly into Ubuntu, without displaying the GRUB bootloader menu that I expected.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with a completely trashed Windows, although there are also other possible explanations.\n\nUsing my Windows 7 laptop, I created a system repair disc and booted my computer from it. Strangely it displayed an error message that the disc \"was not compatible with my version of Windows.\" This does not make sense as both my desktop and laptop are 64-bit versions of Windows 7.\n\nThis is also consistent with my hypothesis, although again, there are other explanations. Note that the \"compatibility\" in this quote refers (or can refer) to the partition table type -- Windows ties the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table to a BIOS-mode boot and the GUID Partition Table (GPT) to an EFI-mode boot. If the Windows installer boots in BIOS mode and sees a GPT disk, or if it boots in EFI mode and sees an MBR disk, it will refuse to do anything with the disk, except (in some circumstances) to repartition the disk and re-install.\nFurther Diagnoses\nTo test my hypothesis, you need to examine your partition table. You can do this with GParted, parted, gdisk, or other tools. The easiest and best for the moment is parted:\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print\nModel: ATA Samsung SSD 850 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 250GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                 Flags\n 1      524kB   1573kB  1049kB               BIOS boot partition  bios_grub\n 2      1573kB  580MB   579MB   fat32        EFI System           boot\n 3      580MB   1106MB  525MB   ext4         Xubuntu /boot\n 4      1631MB  250GB   248GB                Linux LVM            lvm\n\nThe output of parted /dev/sda print will show your partition table. The Partition Table: line shows the partition table type -- GPT in this example. (MBR shows as msdos.) More important is the details of the partitions. If you see one or more NTFS partitions, then I'm probably wrong and Windows may be intact. If you see nothing but Linux partitions (ext4fs, Linux LVM, etc.), as in this example, then my hypothesis is correct. (Note that the FAT32 partition in my example is an EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds boot loaders for all OSes.)\nIf you need help interpreting your partition table, please cut-and-paste the output of parted to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here.\nFixing It\nIf I'm right, you can't fix the problem -- at least, not completely. The best you can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*STOP USING THE INSTALLED OS IMMEDIATELY! Every moment you use the computer from its on-disk Ubuntu is another moment in which Ubuntu may write data over the remnants of your personal files on the hard disk.\n\n*If you don't already have one, buy a disk to use for data recovery. An external disk big enough to hold all your personal files should do fine.\n\n*Boot to an emergency disk (like the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode). A good case can be made for Windows emergency tools, too.\n\n*Run PhotoRec or similar software. These tools enable you to recover individual files, even from an overwritten filesystem -- which is what you've got. I've seen claims that some Windows tools can do a better job at recovering files from an overwritten NTFS partition than PhotoRec can, but I don't have specific program names or URLs. Note that you'll need to recover files to another physical disk -- hence step #2. Also, you're unlikely to recover all your files, and you may spend hours sifting through the files you recover to properly organize them. You may end up with a bunch of Windows program files, which you can throw away -- it will be easier to re-install Windows and your programs than to try to use those individual program files.\n\n*If you want it, re-install Windows. This will require learning about EFI vs. BIOS boot modes. You may want to read this page of mine on the subject, which may help you navigate this minefield. (Note that BIOS/CSM/legacy boot issues may have been part of what set you on the path to this problem, but the most important issue, if my hypothesis is correct, was the bug in libparted.)\n\n\nThis procedure assumes that, like most people, you lack good backups. If you've got good backups, you can restore your personal files from them with much less fuss.\n\nUpdate\nI just did some tests, and it looks like the bug that I think bit you has been fixed in Ubuntu 15.04. I'm pretty certain it was present in 14.04.\n", "Q: Screens fade to blurry This is a awkard behaviour the one I suffer.

But what is the difference between those values then?\nCould you also please describe how to manipulate those values of a process and under which circumstances this might be useful?\n\nA: What is Priority and Why Should I Care?\nWhen talking about processes priority is all about managing processor time. The Processor or CPU is like a human juggling multiple tasks at the same time. Sometimes we can have enough room to take on multiple projects. Sometimes we can only focus on one thing at a time. Other times something important pops up and we want to devote all of our energy into solving that problem while putting less important tasks on the back burner.\nIn Linux we can set guidelines for the CPU to follow when it is looking at all the tasks it has to do. These guidelines are called niceness or nice value. The Linux niceness scale goes from -20 to 19. The lower the number the more priority that task gets. If the niceness value is high number like 19 the task will be set to the lowest priority and the CPU will process it whenever it gets a chance. The default nice value is zero.\nBy using this scale we can allocate our CPU resources more appropriately. Lower priority programs that are not important can be set to a higher nice value, while high priority programs like daemons and services can be set to receive more of the CPU’s focus. You can even give a specific user a lower nice value for all of his/her processes so you can limit their ability to slow down the computer’s core services.\nSource\nSet the priority for new processes with nice, eg\nnice -n 10 firefox\n\nfor existing processes\nrenice 10 -p $(pgrep firefox)\n\nTo set the priority <0 you need sudo, eg:\nrenice -1 -p $(pgrep firefox)\nrenice: failed to set priority for 2769 (process ID): Permission denied\n\nbut not for a priority >=0\n\nExample\n% ps -o pid,comm,pri,nice -p $(pgrep firefox)\n  PID COMMAND         PRI  NI\n 2769 firefox          19   0\n\n% renice 10 -p 2769     # note, we don't need sudo here\n2769 (process ID) old priority 0, new priority 10\n\n% ps -o pid,comm,pri,nice -p $(pgrep firefox)\n  PID COMMAND         PRI  NI\n 2769 firefox           9  10\n\n% sudo renice -19 -p 2769                    \n 2769 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority -19\n\n% ps -o pid,comm,pri,nice -p $(pgrep firefox)\n  PID COMMAND         PRI  NI\n 2769 firefox          38 -19\n\n\nOther example\nTo renice all running processes for a specific user\nrenice 20 -u user_name\n\n\nA: Short Answer\nPR is the priority level. The lower the PR, the higher the priority of the process will be.\nPR is calculated as follows:\n\n*\n\n*for normal processes: PR = 20 + NI (NI is nice and ranges from -20 to\n19)\n\n*for real time processes: PR = - 1 - real_time_priority\n(real_time_priority ranges from 1 to 99)\n\nLong Answer\nThere are 2 types of processes, the normal ones and the real time.\nFor the normal ones (and only for those), nice is applied as follows:\nNice\nThe \"niceness\" scale goes from -20 to 19, whereas -20 is the highest priority and 19 the lowest priority. The priority level is calculated as follows:\nPR = 20 + NI\n\nWhere NI is the nice level and PR is the priority level. So as we can see, the -20 actually maps to 0, while the 19 maps to 39.\nBy default, a program nice value is 0, but it is possible for the root user to launch programs with a specified nice value by using the following command:\nnice -n <nice_value> ./myProgram \n\nReal Time\nWe could go even further. The nice priority is actually used for user programs. Whereas the UNIX/LINUX overall priority has a range of 140 values, nice value enables the process to map to the last part of the range (from 100 to 139). This equation leaves the values from 0 to 99 unreachable which will correspond to a negative PR level (from -100 to -1). To be able to access to those values, the process should be stated as \"real time\".\nThere are 5 scheduling policies in a LINUX environment that can be displayed with the following command:\nchrt -m \n\nWhich will show the following list:\n1. SCHED_OTHER   the standard round-robin time-sharing policy\n2. SCHED_BATCH   for \"batch\" style execution of processes\n3. SCHED_IDLE    for running very low priority background jobs.\n4. SCHED_FIFO    a first-in, first-out policy\n5. SCHED_RR      a round-robin policy\n\nThe scheduling processes could be divided into 2 groups, the normal scheduling policies (1 to 3) and the real time scheduling policies (4 and 5).\nThe real time processes will always have priority over normal processes. A real time process could be called using the following command (The example is how to declare a SCHED_RR policy):\nchrt --rr <priority between 1-99> ./myProgram\n\nTo obtain the PR value for a real time process the following equation is applied:\nPR = -1 - rt_prior\n\nWhere rt_prior corresponds to the priority between 1 and 99. For that reason the process which will have the higher priority over other processes will be the one called with the number 99.\nIt is important to note that for real time processes, the nice value is not used.\nTo see the current \"niceness\" and PR value of a process the following command can be executed:\ntop\n\nWhich shows the following output:\n\nIn the figure the PR and NI values are displayed. It is good to note the process with PR value -51 that corresponds to a real time value. There are also some processes whose PR value is stated as \"rt\". This value actually corresponds to a PR value of -100.\n\nA: Nice value is a user-space and priority PR is the process's actual priority that use by Linux kernel. In linux system priorities are 0 to 139 in which 0 to 99 for real time and 100 to 139 for users. \nnice value range is -20 to +19 where -20 is highest, 0 default and +19 is lowest.\nrelation between nice value and priority is : \nPR = 20 + NI\n\nso , the value of PR = 20 + (-20 to +19) is 0 to 39 that maps 100 to 139.\nAccording to top manual:\n\nPR  --  Priority The  scheduling  priority  of the task.  If you see\n  'rt' in this field, it means the task is running under 'real time'\n  scheduling priority.\n\nNI is nice value of task.\n\nNI  --  Nice Value The  nice  value  of  the task.  A negative nice\n  value means higher priority, whereas a positive nice value means lower\n  priority.Zero in this field simply means priority will not be adjusted\n  in determining a task's dispatch-ability\n\nEdit:\nBy default when a program is launched in Linux, it gets launched with the priority of '0'. However you can change the priority of your programs by either of the following methods.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can launch a program with your required priority using\nnice -n nice_value program_name\n\n\n*you can also change the priority of an already running process using \nrenice -n nice_value -p process_id\n\n", "Q: How to properly update the kernel According to this page, the BCM43340 Broadcom chipset is supported in kernel 4.0+.

I used ubuntu in my previous laptop for some years now. I installed it via wubi. Recently I bought a new laptop and I want to do the same thing. Although I used ubuntu almost exclussively, for some reason I DON'T want to make a partition in my new laptop. I only want to install it like I did in my previous one.\n   So, I installed it in my previous laptop about three or four years ago (it was ubuntu 12.04 back then or maybe an older version). I remember that I dowloaded a small .exe from the ubuntu page (about 2mb if I remember correctly). When I ran it, a window opened and asked me how much space do I want to dedicate to ubuntu, my user name and a password. Now I cannot find it anywhere. I downloaded the 14.04.2 version from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop and I created a virtual cd with deamon. I found the wubi.exe in that and I executed it, but it says that I should restart my computer. It is not like the previous time that it installed ubuntu inside windows. Should I do it? Is it the same, or it will do a partition? I found an older version of wubi somewhere (for 9.04). If I use that one, will I be able to update later to 14.04 from inside ubuntu? I forgot to mention that my new computer (as my previous one) runs windows7 and not 8 (I know that wubi doesn't work with win8). \n   Thank you very much!\n\nA: Wubi is depreciated.

You\n  would be able to install, but not reboot into Ubuntu.\nIf you upgraded to Windows 8 and are using BIOS firmware, Wubi does\n  work, but do not enable hybrid-sleep on Windows 8.\n\nNote that this applies to Windows 10 also.\nTo install Ubuntu, burn the iso to a DVD/USB and install from it.\n", "Q: Remove any trailing blank lines or lines with whitespaces from end of file I want to get delete all of the blank lines and lines with spaces (if any exist (ONLY from the bottom of the file)) and then to remove one more line (also ONLY from the bottom of the file).\nI have this code:\nwhile [[ \"$last_line\" =~ $ ]] || [[ \"$last_line\" =~ ^[[:space:]]+$ ]]\ndo\n    sed -i -e '${/$/d}' \"./file.txt\"\ndone\n    sed -i -e '${/$/d}' \"./file.txt\"\n\nFor some reason the loop doesn't stop and it deletes everything in the file. What is the matter?\n\nA: Your script should work if fixed like so:\nwhile\n last_line=$(tail -1 \"./file.txt\")\n [[ \"$last_line\" =~ ^$ ]] || [[ \"$last_line\" =~ ^[[:space:]]+$ ]]\ndo\n sed -i '$d' \"./file.txt\"\ndone\n\nYour script had two main problems: (1) you never updated $last_line, so the loop's guard would always evaluate the same thing; (2) your [[ \"$last_line\" =~ $ ]] test matched any line, since any line has an end. (This is the reason why your script emptied your file completely.) You probably want to match against ^$ instead, which matches only empty lines. Additionally, I simplified the sed command to delete the last line in the loop's body (simply $d does the job).\nHowever, this script is unnecessarily complicated. sed is there for just that kind of thing! This one-liner will do the same thing as the above script:\nsed -i ':a;/^[ \\n]*$/{$d;N;ba}' ./file.txt\n\nRoughly,\n\n\n*\n\n*Match current line against ^[ \\n]*$. (i.e, can only contain whitespaces and newlines)\n\n*If it doesn't match, just print it. Read in next line and continue with step 1.\n\n*If it does match,\n\n\n*\n\n*If we are at the end of the file, delete it.\n\n*If we are not at the end of the file, append the next line to the current line, inserting a newline character between the two, and go back to step 1 with this new, longer line.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of awesome sed tutorials on the Internet. For example, I can recommend this one. Happy learning! :-)\nUpdate: And of course, if you additionally want to remove the last (non-blank) line of the file after having truncated the trailing blank lines, you can just use another sed -i '$d' ./file.txt after either your script or the above one-liner. I intentionally did not want to include that in the sed one-liner since I thought that removing trailing blank lines is quite a reusable piece of code that may be interesting for other people; but removing the last non-blank line is really specific to your use case, and trivial anyway once you removed the trailing blank lines.\n\nA: This task is way more easily accomplished by processing the file's lines in the opposite order.\ntac infile | awk 'flag {print} {if(NF) flag=1}' | tac | sponge infile\n\nAs pointed out in the comments by Malte Skoruppa and zwets, Ubuntu doesn't come with the moreutils package preinstalled, which contains sponge; an alternative solution is to use a command substitution inside a herestring to read the input file, so that, being the command substitution processed first, the file is safe to be truncated by the second tac command:\n<<<\"$(< infile)\" tac | awk 'flag {print} {if(NF) flag=1}' | tac > infile\n\n\n\n*\n\n*tac infile: ... does the opposite of cat infile (!): prints the file to stdout inverting the line's order;\n\n*awk [...]: processes the file;\n\n*tac: ... does the opposite of cat (!): prints the file to stdout inverting the line's order;\n\n*sponge infile: outputs to infile only when the left side of the pipe has terminated its execution, to avoid truncating infile before it's read by the first tac command;\n\n\nawk command breakdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*flag {print}: if flag is set, it will print the line; flag won't be set until a record whose NF value matches a number greater than 0 is processed, so until a record whose NF value matches a number greater than 0 is not found, the print command will be skipped;\n\n*{if(NF) flag=1}: if while flag is still unset a record whose NF value matches a number greater than 0 is processed, it will not be printed and flag will be set to 1, so the first record whose NF value matches a number greater than 0 won't be printed;\n\n\nTest on a test file (mind that line 4 and line 7 contain 5 spaces, while line 5 and line 8 are empty):\nuser@debian ~ % cat infile                                           \nline1\nline2\nline3\n\n\nline6\n\n\nuser@debian ~ % tac infile | awk 'flag {print} {if(NF) flag=1}' | tac\nline1\nline2\nline3\n\n\nuser@debian ~ % \n\nLine 7 and line 8 have been removed because they were both at the end of the file, containing only spaces (line 7) or containing nothing (line 8); line 6 was deleted because it was the first one, reading the file's lines in the opposite order, to have at least 1 field (hence not being empty or containing only spaces)\n\nA: Edit\nSo originally, I've missed the point that OP wants to remove only last blank line, which my original solution does as well. Nonetheless, here's the version that removes only the last one, and if its blank.\nawk -v numlines=$(wc -l file2|cut -f1 -d' ')  'NR < numlines; END {if (NF) print }' file2\nWhat the code does is fairly straightforward - get number of lines, and print every line, until the last one. On the last one, we check if the line contains any fields; if there is any text, NF evaluates to an integer (true) thus printing last line, and if there's nothing or spaces only - NF evaluates to zero (false) and doesn't print anything else.\nAs for removing one more line, head -n -1 will do.\nBellow is the small demo. The trailing newline is designated with $ prompt is *$\n*$ cat -A file2                                                                                                                                      \n212$\n1231$\n$\n324234$\n213$\n$\n*$ awk -v numlines=$(wc -l file2|cut -f1 -d' ')  'NR < numlines ; END {if ( NF ) print }' file2 | head -n -1                                         \n212\n1231\n\n324234\n\nOriginal\nawk solution.\nawk 'NF' file1 > /tmp/tmpfile && cat /tmp/tmpfile > file1 \nHere we use Number of Fields variable as test for printing. For blank lines, number of fields is zero, hence it blank lines evaluating to false won't be printed. Now , unless your awk version supports in-line editing (which is gnu awk or gawk, I think), you have to redirect output to temporary output and back to the original file with cat, like I did here\nVariation on the theme would be to use regex to test if lines contain some particular data, like digits or alphanumeric characters, e.g.\nawk '$0~/[[:digit:]]||[[:alpha:]]/  ' file1 > /tmp/tmpfile && cat /tmp/tmpfile > file1\n\nA: As I understand\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove empty lines from the end of the file\n\n*Remove lines with spaces from the end of the file\n\n*And then remove one more line\n\n\nUsing awk and tac\ntac foo | awk '! non_empty && ! /^$/ && ! /[ \\t]/ {non_empty = 1} non_empty {skip++} skip > 1 {print}' | tac\n\nMore variations below the example …\n\nExample\n% cat -n foo                                                                \n     1  line1\n     2  line2\n     3  line3\n     4  \n     5  \n     6  line6\n     7  line 7 \n     8  \n\n% tac foo | awk '! non_empty && ! /^$/ && ! /[ \\t]/ {non_empty = 1} non_empty {skip++} skip > 1 {print}' | tac > bar\n\n% cat -n bar\n     1  line1\n     2  line2\n     3  line3\n     4  \n     5  \n\n\nTo remove only the blank lines at the end of the file\ntac foo | awk '! non_empty && ! /^$  {non_empty = 1} non_empty {print}' | tac\n\n\nTo remove the blank lines at the end and one more line\ntac foo | awk '! non_empty && ! /^$/ &&  {non_empty = 1} non_empty {skip++} skip > 1 {print}' | tac\n\n", "Q: bash is looking for a missing ' \" ' , unexpected EOF I have problem with bash which is looking for a missing character but I cannot find it.

You are right there is a missing '\"' and you should add it there.\nWhen you add the '\"' at the end of line 120 then line 120 alters your PATH environment variable in a way it shouldn't. It overrides the PATH and does not take care about previous value of PATH. The correct line 120 would be:\nexport PATH=\"/home/chill/android-studio/bin:$PATH\"\n\nTake a look at other similar lines and you will notice there is always \":$PATH\" at the end. That means that you only add a new directory to already existing list of directories in the $PATH. Your line 120 just overrides PATH with one directory. With $PATH at the end your sudo will work too. Not just the bashrc script.\n\nA: Pasting the code in ShellCheck reveals the problem:\n120  export PATH=\"/home/chill/android-studio/bin\n                  ^––SC1078 Did you forget to close this double quoted string?\n\n121  export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"\n                  ^––SC1079 This is actually an end quote, but due to next char it looks suspect.\n\nSo you need to add a closing double quote in this line:\nexport PATH=\"/home/chill/android-studio/bin\n\nbecoming this:\nexport PATH=\"/home/chill/android-studio/bin\"\n                                           ^\n\n", "Q: Inconsistency between ntpd and ntpdate I am trying to synchronize two computer in my local network.\nTo do so I use NTP on one computer to synchronize with an ntp pool.

Rather, this is the time taken for a roundtrip of the ntp message. \nThere is a fundamental uncertainty as to how to synchronize two clocks when messages between them take some amount of time, greater than zero. NTP tries to do the best guess it can. However, if for example the network messages take a drastically different time in each direction, it will not be accurate.\nIn other words, you shouldn't worry about the delay figure. It is a statistic provided for people tweaking NTP and does not represent the level of discrepancy.\nSee for example http://tech.kulish.com/2007/10/30/ntp-ntpq-output-explained/\n", "Q: Windows to ubuntu-server samba share almost double as fast as ubuntu or mac os x to samba share I have recently build my second home server.

You can then setup other computers to pull updates from this machine.\nThis is the most complete solution as all packages can be downloaded ready, but can involve a large download and a lot of disk space 150GB+ if you download, main, updates, restricted, universe and multiverse packages.\napt-cacher\nThis is the product I use, it will cache only packages a machine has requested, I have it in SQUID proxy so when one machine downloads the deb any other machine trying to download that deb gets it from the squid cache.\nWhere to get them\nThey are both in the standard repositories and can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install apt-cacher\nsudo apt-get install apt-mirror\n\nJust googling found this article that will get you going on getting it completed.\n\nA: So basically you want development ISO's?\nYou can use TestDrive, if you can figure out where it stores the iso's.  It has a nice GUI interface, and lets you choose your flavor of Ubuntu/Kubuntu:\nInstalling TestDrive\nUbuntu users of 10.04 (and later) can install TestDrive directly from the archive, from the Software Center or the command line.\nsudo apt-get install testdrive\n\nJigdo looks like it can update you with the latest release iso.  It's a command line interface:\nInstalling jigdo\nsudo apt-get install jigdo-file\n\n", "Q: Launcher disappeared I have installed Ubuntu 14.04. It worked for approx. 2 days.

I was confused, trying to copy some files from one PC to another. I have it figured out, but the syntax is still confusing to me.\nThis works:\nscp ~/Desktop/Volenteer.png jay@server.ip:~j0h/b\n\nwhich puts Volenteer.png in the folder /home/j0h/b.  However, this doesn't work:\nscp ~Desktop/Volenteer.png     jay@server.ip:~j0h/b\n\nThis also fails, giving an exit status 1 file not found:\nscp ~/Desktop/Volenteer.png     jay@server.ip:~/j0h/b\n\nAs does this:\nscp ~Desktop/Volenteer.png     jay@server.ip:~j0h/b\n\nSo clearly, there is some difference between ~ and ~/\nThat difference is the presence of / \n$~/\nbash: /home/j0h/: Is a directory\n$ ~\nbash: /home/j0h: Is a directory\n\nSo why in scp, does the ~ resolve to ~/ ?\nThat is a guess, I cant verify that's what is happening. \nBut it seems inconsistent, and therefore confusing. \nIs this a bug in scp? or is there something about tilde I am missing?\n\nA: ~ is your home directory.\n~foo is the home directory of user foo, if such a user exists, or just a directory named ~foo, if that user doesn't exist.\n\nHence, in:\nscp ~Desktop/Volenteer.png     jay@server.ip:~j0h/b\n\n~Desktop will expand to home directory of user Desktop, if such a user exists (and it usually does not), or be just ~Desktop (a path which usually does not exist either).\n\nIn:\nscp ~/Desktop/Volenteer.png     jay@server.ip:~/j0h/b\n\n~/j0h will expand to a directory named j0h in jay's home directory, which, again, is unlikely to exist.\n\nIt's not ~ and ~/ where the difference occurs, but in ~ and ~foo.\n\nAdditionally, ~ can also be used for directory history navigation:\n\n\n*\n\n*~- is the previous working directory (like $OLDPWD)\n\n*~+ is the current working directory (like $PWD)\n\n\nThis is not applicable to scp, since you don't get to change directories in the middle of an scp operation.\nAnd if you use pushd and popd to maintain a directory stack, ~N and ~+N would be the N th directory in the directory stack, as seen in the output of dirs. ~-N would be the N th directory from the end (counting from zero, in both cases). For example:\n$ for i in etc usr var tmp; do pushd /$i; done\n/etc ~/.vim\n/usr /etc ~/.vim\n/var /usr /etc ~/.vim\n/tmp /var /usr /etc ~/.vim\n\n$ dirs\n/tmp /var /usr /etc ~/.vim\n\nThen, the directories in the stack can be accessed using:\n/tmp /var /usr /etc ~/.vim\n  ~0   ~1   ~2   ~3     ~4\n ~+0  ~+1  ~+2  ~+3    ~+4\n ~-4  ~-3  ~-2  ~-1    ~-0 \n  ~+   ~-\n\n\nA: The symbol ~ is used as a shortcut for /home/user in bash, so in the case of ~/Desktop/Volenteer.png it is shorthand for /home/user/Desktop/Volenteer.png.\nSo as you can see the /, as always, shows an new level in the file system hierarchy. \n\nA: ~ is shorthand for the environment variable $HOME on most c shell derivative/supporting POSIX compliant shells. the most common use for ~ is when referencing your own home directory or that of another user's home:\ncd ~ # ie shell, take me to my home folder\n\ncd ~root # i.e. shell, take me to root's home folder\n\nTo find the home directory for any local user on a POSIX system (UNIX, Linux, OS X, BSD) that is using the passwd(5) database run awk on /etc/passwd like so:\nawk -F: '{ print $1,$(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis will list each local user and their home directory.\n\nA: Have a read through of the GNU documentation for Bash Tilde Expansion (as I should have before my first iteration of this answer).\n~/Desktop and ~j0h are doing fundamentally different things, which explains why ~Desktop doesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*A plain ~ is substituted for your current $HOME environment variable, set on login. So ~ resolves to /home/oli for me, and ~/Desktop reads as /home/oli/Desktop. This is where you see the tilda being used most.\n\n*~username resolves to the home of that user, as set in /etc/passwd. So ~oli resolves to /home/oli, ~j0h might resolve to /home/j0h but not neccessarily, your homedir can be anywhere.\n\n*~not-a-username doesn't resolve. Because Desktop is not a user, ~Desktop isn't substituted. It is taken literally as a file or path named ~Desktop (which doesn't exist here).\nAnd needless to say, this is all happening remotely (it'd be useless in scp if it were replaced with local values). This works because Bash won't substitute ~... if it's preceded by anything but whitespace.\n", "Q: How to resize & create exfat partitions on SDCARD I have an external 64Gb SDCard which I formate to exfat (default) in my smartphone, but I want to reformat it to create 4 x 16Gb exfat partitions using my PC.  Gparted and KDE Partition Manager do not resize exfat.\nHow do I do it?\n\nA: Gparted and KDE Partition Manager do not resize exfat because there are no (command line) tools to resize exfat.\nThe easiest thing you can do is to backup all data from your exfat partition and copy it back later after repartitioning.\n", "Q: Where to put .config file when recompiling kernel?

Where should I put this .config file so that when I type make it uses that? The source I'm building from is linux-lts-utopic-3.16.0, and I'm using the debian folder in that.\n\nA: The.config file needs to be present in the base directory of a kernel source code which you are going to compile using make utility. Go to base directory and type ls -a the  .config file should be there (probably in /usr/src/).\nThis is a blog for compiling a kernel from source (not ubuntu specific). https://prashantchikhalkar.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/linux-kernel-compilation-from-source-to-running/ \n\nA: If your source file in /usr/src/linux copy  .config file into /usr/src/linux and run make oldconfig  instead make menuconfig then run make to compile your kernel.\n", "Q: Windows 7 won't boot after editing Windows loader partition with GParted I made the uninformed decision to add a label (and nothing else) to my windows loader partition with GParted.\nThe GParted entry is:\n( /dev/sda1 | fat32 | [no mount point] | [new label] | 900.00 MiB | 47.56 MiB | 852.44 MiB | boot ) if it helps to identify the partition I mean.\nWindows 7 no longer boots from GRUB (though its entry remains present), displaying the message: \"Setting partition type to 0xb\".\nI am dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu, and can still boot to Ubuntu.\nI do not have the Windows install or repair CD with me.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: https://neosmart.net/wiki/recovering-windows-bootloader/\nFollowing advice from here, I downloaded and created a Windows 10 installer usb (which is free) and repaired the Windows bootloader from the installer command prompt:\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\nbootsect.exe nt60 all /force\n\nThis allowed me to boot from windows again.\nI then created an Ubuntu live usb; and installed and ran the boot-repair \napp to reinstall GRUB:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nThis worked for me.\n", "Q: Switching from old CRT monitor to new LED monitor I have been using a Dell CRT monitor for years.

Nothing else is displayed. When I switch back to the old one, I can not find such an entry to select from in the monitor settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*My system: Ubuntu 15.04, updated   \n\n*Old monitor: Dell CRT 16\" \n\n*New monitor: Samsung LED 21.5\"\n\n\nNow, what will be the best way for me to move forward? Carry out new installation of Ubuntu with the new monitor connected? Or, is there a short cut?\n\nA: Ubuntu does not recognize a new monitor when it is replaced on the fly. That is, when the computer is running, and you yank out the cable of the old monitor and put in the new one. This is not safe, and may damage your computer and / or monitor.\n\n\n*\n\n*The proper method is to turn the computer off.\n\n*Turn the old monitor off.\n\n*Unplug the old monitor from its power source.\n\n*Plug the new monitor (LCD) to the computer.\n\n*Plug the new monitor to the power source, and turn it on.\n\n*Finally, turn the computer on.\n\n\nWhen the computer is turned back on, it will verify that a monitor is connected and at that time it will set itself up for the new monitor.\nThe same method should be used for other operating systems..\nRebooting the computer with the new monitor connected works too.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: vsftpd restrict users to home directory I have installed vsftpd and have set my config as such:\n# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf\n#\n# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid.

Tips? I have a nice laptop (i5, 8gb, 256gbssd) and I want to dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu. Some people and some forms explained that you shouldn't partition an SSD, or the performance will decrease. Other forms had stories of people doing this and seemed fine.\nCould someone clarify whether it's safe to partition an SSD for dual booting purposes? If it does affect performance, how bad is it? What do I need to do to keep my PC at peak performance? How much unallocated space should I leave free? Any other tips?\nNormally, when I do this type of thing, I use a desktop with two separate ssd's. One for each operating system, then put my home folder and files on a different HDD, then another one for RAID1..... If I need to, I can buy a low profile flash drive, and boot Ubuntu off a live disk each time, but I'd prefer a dual boot.\nThanks!\n\nA: I was puzzled by the same question before dual-booting my laptop with Ubuntu. Now that I'm done with partitioning my Samsung 850 EVO drive, I can say from experience that partitioning has no visible effect on SSD performance. My system is as snappy as always. Both Windows and Ubuntu work flawlessly. I have 100GB system partition, 300GB for games/programs, 40GB for Ubuntu and the rest for OP. There are 2 smaller partitions, 450MB recovery & 100MB EFI.\nWhile day to day tasks don't feel slow, I should point out that benchmark results from Samsung Magician show reduced random IOPS. Sequential read/write are 544/520 MBPS which is fine. But Random read/write which used to be around 88k IOPS now shows ~44k IOPS. I don't know what's causing this. Maybe it's assessing only C drive?\nAs for unallocated space, depending on manufacturer, SSDs may need anywhere between 5%-12% of total capacity. For performance/reliability, you may want to have a look at this guide - \nhttp://www.thessdreview.com/ssd-guides/optimization-guides/the-ssd-optimization-guide-ultimate-windows-8-edition/\n", "Q: So many entries in Grub I've just installed Kubuntu 15.04 on the Asus T200TA laptop which came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled.\nI have the following options available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Advanced options for Ubuntu\n\n*Windows UEFI bootmgfw.efi\n\n*Windows Boot UEFI loader\n\n*EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/mmcblk0p2)\n\n*Ubuntu 15.04 (15.04) (on /dev/mmcblk0p5)\n\n*Advanced options for Ubutu 15.04 (15.04) (on /dev/mmcblk0p5)\n\n*System setup\n\n\nWhy are there so many entries in the grub menu?

Also, grub keeps track of older kernels and propose you to use them to boot (when you'll have newer kernel installed).\n[*] Those \"ways\" are option you can pass at boot time, to specify certain modules to load, or modify some module behaviour. For example, the recovery mode entry does not specify a gfxmode option, which result in the system booting without graphical interface.\nI believe the 15.04 option comes from a new kernel package that was not present when you initially installed Ubuntu. The reason why you have a new entry for your new ubuntu flavor is that as the graphical environment change, grub needs a new entry to allow you booting with it. \nYou can modify their placement my changing the number of files in /etc/grub.d/[x][filename].

You now have Ubuntu installed alongside Linux. You can choose whether to boot into Linux or Windows once your PC has started.\n\nA: There are two ways you can go about installing Ubuntu \"in a windows 7 operating system.\" It depends on what you want, which was hard to determine with the information you posted. You can install in a virtual machine which runs inside of Windows, or you can partition your hard drive and boot into Ubuntu. Which were you trying to do? \nInstalling Ubuntu is pretty simple. Yay! \nYou need to download a USB image writer. Such as this one:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nYou're also going to need a USB flash drive.\nOnce you've got that downloaded, go ahead and run it as well as plug in your flash drive. Select your .iso that you already have downloaded. Then select your flash drive and make sure you select to format(This is gonna erase everything from your flash drive so make sure you save everything you have on there somewhere else). Then hit create and it'll write the .iso to your flash drive.\nAfter you have a bootable flash drive, boot into it. Shutdown your computer, plug in your flash drive, and then power on.  Hit the key for one-time-boot options (F12 for Dell, F9 for HP, blah blah, google it if you can't find out how). Select USB boot in the boot options and then it'll boot into Ubuntu. \nOnce you've booted into Ubuntu you have two options, try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu. If you want to install alongside Windows you're safe to hit install. It'll give you an option to install along side an operating system. Go through the installer and bam. \nI do this daily, I'm a computer technician and we use Linux on our machines.\n\nA: I have downloaded ubuntu-14.04.2 desktop-amd64.iso.\nIs it possible that we copy the iso file into our pendrive and then boot it from Pendrive after restarting?\nIf yes, could you please provide me with the steps for that. \nTo be frank, I am not good with the computers\n", "Q: My .viminfo file doesn't have a writing permissions, how should i grant it?

For Sound, it would be /usr/share/applications/gnome-sound-panel.desktop. Change the Name fields (at least the one corresponding to your locale). For example, the following command would do:\nsudo sed -i.bak '/^Name/s/Sound/Audio Control/' /usr/share/applications/gnome-sound-panel.desktop\n\nTo revert, you can copy over the backup file that sed made:\nsudo cp /usr/share/applications/gnome-sound-panel.desktop{.bak,}\n\nEffect:\n\n\nTo change the icon, you can edit the Icon field in the same file.

Once the chroot command is issued, the LiveCD treats the broken system's / as its own. Commands run in a chroot environment will affect the broken systems filesystems and not those of the LiveCD. \n\n\nA: This shows adding nomodeset for both BIOS and grub screen after install. \nUEFI also uses grub screen so look at that which is further down.

I found no such option in BIOS. Then I installed fancontrol also according to the manual. Unfortunately, when running sudo pwmconfig I got the following error:\n/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\n\nI tried fixing it with this hack, which consisted of adding acpi_enforce_resources=lax to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. It didn't work, nothing changed when running sudo pwmconfig after updating grub and rebooting.\nI also tried to turn off the switchable AMD graphics following these instructions, but it didn't reduce the temperatures.\nDo you have any idea on why the fan isn't spinning faster at such temperatures or how to control it manually?\n\n\n=== UPDATE ===\n\n\n\nNot sure what happened, but when I ran sensors today it started to show the fan's RPM value at the bottom:\nthinkpad-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nfan1:         255 RPM\n\nAnyway I now can see (and show you) the numbers of how slowly my fan is running.\nMoreover, I found under this link a guy with a similar problem.

Background: I installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS and would like to install and use Aptana (and Java). Google pointed me to the guide how to do this and i successfully did this under the initial Ubuntu account with administrative privileges. (this way: http://goo.gl/N5I1eW) However, as far as i understand, it is not safe to use the admin account daily. So, i created a standard account, but standard account does not have access to whatever i installed under the admin account and it may not sudo or install software. I am back to the clean Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS with the admin and the standard users now. I could not find any guides about installing software for other users so far.\nNot a duplicate of anything because: the new dimension of this question is related to security - installing Aptana for use not under the admin's account, but by admin to be used under the standard user's account. As a newbie, I am not sure of the finer details and would appreciate a clarification by a more experienced Ubuntu user.\n\nA: In most cases, installing applications for all users on Ubuntu requires root access.  Binaries are installed in /usr/bin, which is writable only by root, and likewise for other installed files.\nThe usual way to install packages from the command line is using the apt-get tool, running under sudo:\nsudo apt-get install package-name\n\nIf you run this from an account that has sudo access, it will prompt for your password and then run the command as root.\nThere are also GUI package managers; they'll prompt for your password when you do anything that requires root access.\n\nHowever, as far as i understand, it is not safe to use the admin account daily.\n\nIt's not safe to run an interactive shell under the root account. It's too easy for a typo in a command to mess up your system. That's why sudo exists -- so you can (carefully!) execute individual commands as root while being logged in as an ordinary user.\nI suppose that setting up one user account with sudo access, and another user account without sudo access (and using the latter for most purposes) is slightly safer than giving your usual user account sudo access.  I've never bothered to do that myself. If the system is not shared with other users, I suggest just configuring your own account with sudo access and being careful about what you use it for. You'll have root access, but you won't be able to use it accidentally; typing sudo will be a reminder that you're doing something that could be dangerous.\nBased on the information in this question, it looks like Aptana has to be installed by unzipping a downloaded file under /opt.  The same considerations apply. Rather than running apt-get install under sudo, you'll just run unzip under sudo.\nIt's good to be cautious, even a bit paranoid, about using root privileges -- but if you need to install software, you need to use your root privileges.\nSome software can be configured for installation under your home directory, to be used only from your own user account. On the other hand, some software is preconfigured to assume that, for example, its binaries are under /usr/bin. I don't know whether you can install Aptana under an ordinary user account. But judging from the answer to the linked question, I'd probably just go ahead and install it under /opt. There's always a risk in installing any third-party software, but people do it all the time.\nOn further thought, let me clarify some points.\nThere are (to an initial rough approximation) three kinds of accounts on the system:\n\n\n*\n\n*The root account. This account can do anything on the system: install software, read other users' files, reformat the disk. In normal usage, you should probably never login to this account.\n\n*One or more administrative users. These are people who are trusted to use root privileges, for example to install software packages to be used by everyone on the system. Each administrative user can use the sudo command.\n\n*Zero or more non-administrative users. These users do not have sudo access, and cannot install software outside their own home directories.\nThe systems I use have a single administrative user (me) and no non-administrative users, since I either own or control the entire system for my own use. A multi-user system will of course have more accounts.\nIt's also possible to modify the sudoers file to permit some users to run only certain commands as root; those users would be somewhere between 2 and 3 in the above list.\nIf you're the only user of the system (something that wasn't clear from your question), just set up a user account for yourself with sudo privileges. Use sudo only for administrative activities like installing software.\n(Sorry about the length of this answer. I haven't had time to make it shorter.)\n", "Q: Install dataStax java-driver on ubuntu 15.04 I am trying to Install a datastax java-driver on ubuntu 15.04, can anyone advise the best course of action as the github repo does not give a detailed procedure?\n\nA: Usually you would add the java driver as a Maven dependency when you build your Cassandra client application.  That would pull in the jar file for the driver and you could package it with your client application as you see fit.\nSo in your Maven pom.xml you'd add the version you want as a dependency like this:\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.datastax.cassandra</groupId>\n  <artifactId>cassandra-driver-core</artifactId>\n  <version>2.1.3</version>\n  <scope>compile</scope>\n</dependency>\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a Chromebook without a dual-boot I am looking at getting a Chromebook but I don't like limitations on my computer systems and looking to get back into a heavier Linux work load. Has anyone install a complete version of Ubuntu on a Chromebook without having a dual-boot setup? If so is it just simply booting from a USB drive and installing the OS or is there more coding involved?  I am looking at some of the Asus Chromebooks.\nThank You in advance for any help or suggestions.\n\nA: I found these results online:\n\nSwapnil  Bhartiya - November 17, 2014\nHow to Easily Install Ubuntu on Chromebook with Crouton\n\n\n\n\nHow to Install Ubuntu\n#Step 1: Back up your data \nBefore we start poking around, please ensure that you have a back-up of your data. Since all of your data is synced to Google Server, you actually don’t have to worry about losing any data. The only data that you must make a back-up of is the ‘Download’ folder because the content of this folder is not synced. Once you have taken the back-up, it’s also a fail-safe plan to create a restore USB of ChromeOS, in case something goes wrong and you need to re-install ChromeOS.\n#Step 2: Create a restore image for Chrome OS \nSince Crouton is not going to wipe your Chrome OS, there is no risk of corrupting your Chrome OS. It’s always a good idea to keep a restore image of your OS.\nInstall Chromebook recovery utility from the Chrome web store. Open the app and follow the instructions to create the recovery drive. It’s an easy three-step, click next process. All you need is working Internet and a USB drive with at least 4GB space.\n\nOnce the recovery disk is created, unplug it and follow the following steps.\n#Step 3: Enable developer mode \nIn order to install your own operating system on Chromebooks, you have to enable the developer mode. It’s extremely easy to do and is very well documented by Google. The latest Chromebooks use a combination of keys to enter the developer mode, whereas older devices have a physical switch. Different devices have different locations for the switch, so please Google your device to find the location of the switch and flip it. If you are on the latest Chromebook then you can enable the developer mode by holding Esc + Refresh keys and then push the ‘power’ button. The recovery screen will show a scary warning. Just ignore it and let Chrome OS wipe your data. The process can take up to 15 minutes, so don’t turn off your Chromebook.\n\nAlso keep in mind that once Chrome OS is reinstalled you will continue to see this warning every time you boot your system, as long as the developer mode is enabled. However, it won’t wipe the data every time. You can simply hit Ctrl+d to quickly boot into Chrome OS (don’t do it this time while Chrome OS is preparing your system for developer mode).\nStep #4: Let’s install Crouton \n1- Log into your Chromebook and open the GitHub page of Crouton and download the latest script.\nCheck the download folder to see if crouton is downloaded.\n2- Open the terminal in Chromebook (yes, there is now a terminal in Chromebook! by hitting Alt+Ctrl+t \n3 -Type this command to open shell: shell\n\n4- Now we are going to install Ubuntu. There are several desktop environments available including KDE Plasma, Unity and Xfce. Unity can be quite heavy for Chromebook hardware and xfce is way too plain for my taste, so I am going to install KDE Plasma.\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t kde\n(If you don’t want KDE, then you can replace kde with xfce, or unity )\nFor example:\nsudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce\nWe have not encrypted the chroot, if you want to encrypt it then add -e parameter to the command above:\nsudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t kde\nIf you are installing it on a Chromebook with touchscreen then also add the ‘touch’ parameter:\nsudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t touch,kde\nSince the script will download Ubuntu from the Internet, depending on your broadband speed, it may take a while, so go and grab some Indian chai or coffee. With my 150Mbps download speed it took me around 18 minutes. Once the install is finished Crouton will ask you to enter the user-name and UNIX password for it - which will be used to perform administrative tasks in Kubuntu.\n\nNow you can start Plasma by running the following command in shell:\nsudo startkde\nIf you installed xfce then run:\nsudo startxfce4\nYou will be greeted by the KDE greeter.\n\nFine tune Ubuntu \nThe install will be bare-minimum and won’t come with the applications that are packed by distributions, but you can easily install applications from Konsole / terminal. It’s also a good idea to update the system.\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install\nI installed all that I needed - LibreOffice, Sublime Text, Chrome browser (so I can watch Netflix), GIMP, VLC, etc.\nHow to switch between Chrome OS and Ubuntu? \nTo go back to Chrome OS, and keep KDE running, use this key combination Alt+Ctrl+Shift+Back. To come back to Kubuntu from Chrome OS, use this combination:Alt+Ctrl+Shift+Forward. You can find the back/forward keys on the top row of the keyboard.\nWhen you log out of KDE, it exits you from Chroot and you will have to again run the sudo startkde command to start Plasma or the desktop that you have installed.\n\nSource  - https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/795730-how-to-easily-install-ubuntu-on-chromebook-with-crouton\n\n\n*\n\n*https://youtu.be/2a_rq6bYR3M\n", "Q: Unable to access \"windows\" Today just when I started installing a new copy of Windows 10 on my laptop I realised that I hadn't retrieved the windows product key from the hard disk.\nI quickly took out the USB stick which I was using to install windows and forcibly shutdown my laptop using the power button.\nNow I can't boot into Windows so I made an Ubuntu bootable usb stick to access the files from the hard disk but the following message comes up:\nError mounting /dev/sda4 at /media/ubuntu/Data: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999\" \"/dev/sda4\" \"/media/ubuntu/Data\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda4': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nWhat can I do in this situation? Is it possible to contact the manufacturer to get the product key?\n\nA: If windows8, I believe the key is stored somewhere in the system BIOS.\nAs for accessing the NTFS partition. The problem you have is that Windows was not properly shut down so the Windows system is in a hibernate state. You should properly shut down Windows.\nHave you tried using the Windows 10 installation USB to boot up? You could probably start the system up using any Windows installation media. Then, once the system is started up you can shut the system down properly.\nYou can also usually access a command prompt from the Windows installation media. From there you may be able to run the following command to resolve the issue:\npowercfg /h off\n\nAgain, you run that command using the command prompt (sometimes called CMD) from the Windows installation media. \nAfter you properly shut the system down, you will probably be able to access your files using Ubuntu if there are some files you need to retrieve before beginning the installation again.\nFinally, Windows 10 sometimes has a repair mode or something similar to that you can use to try and repair whatever is left. Also, I believe Windows 10 doesn't require a product key as it verifies the legitimacy of the existing Windows media currently on the device and I believe it matches and verifies your unique device rather than requiring a product code entered manually but I'm not sure.\n\nA: Try to use ntfsfix (it's fix common errors and force Windows to check NTFS) by typing :\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/name_of_the_partition\n\nIn your case :\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda4\n\n", "Q: .kde/share/config permissions got messed up even after a reinstall This Q is kind of a follow up from this earlier Q where I had a strange issue with kate which didn't show any plug-ins. While I got it working now (by copying the config folder from one machine to another), I still don't quite understand why the permissions got messed up, and even more why that problem persists after a reinstall.\nI used these commands to uninstalled kate:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -i kate\nthen for each found entry, I did these two:\nsudo apt-get autoremove kate\nsudo apt-get --purge remove kate\nthen I reinstall kate from Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the above steps correct to reinstall a package in Ubuntu?\n\n*Are there some missing steps that may have caused the package not being reinstalled in a clean state (that somehow affected the permissions in some config folders)?\n\n\nA: Package installation via apt-get and dpkg typically do not touch your user-specific preferences (settings) and documents. Programs that follow the XDG Base Directory specification will typically have their settings stored in the ~/.config/ folder. Some create subdirectories (such as ~/.config/vlc/), others store a file directly in the directory (such as ~/.config/Texmakerrc).\nOther settings are typically found in so-called dot-files which are hidden files and directories stored in your home directory (such as ~/.mozilla/).\nSettings for KDE 4 can typically be found below ~/.kde/share/config/ or ~/.kde/share/appps/. Another place to look for settings is ~/.local/share/.\nAs a general hint, to find settings that have recently been changed, use the find program with the -mmin -X option  to look for files that were changed in the past X minutes. For example, find all files (-type f) in your home directory (~) that changed in the past ten minutes (-mmin 10) and print verbose information (-ls):\nfind ~ -type f -mmin -10 -ls\n\n", "Q: Steam will not run games (OpenGL Error) Every time I go to play a game on Steam it won't run, and gives me this error:\nCould not find required OpenGL entry point 'glGetError'! either your video card is unsupported, or OpenGL driver needs to be updated.

I'm now using Ubuntu 15.04.\nWhen I launch Evernote, an error message pops up, telling me that it can't connect to the server.\nSo I downloaded Firefox for Windows, installed it using Wine and it has internet access.\nI also tried cleaning out my Wine prefix and using a newer version of Evernote (5.8.13.8152) in case the server doesn't accept the old one any longer.\n[ I'm aware of the fact that there are alternative clients but I prefer the original application for various reasons. ]\n\nA: There is a solution suggested in this post: How to configure wine to install Evernote?, explained further here: instalar-evernote-en-linux (is in Spanish but it has a lot of images)\nYou could install playonlinux.

Has anyone run into this issue or have any workarounds? \n\nA: There is currently a open bug report about the problem which comes also with a workaround.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/1565060\n", "Q: How to boot from USB I have downloaded ubuntu-14.04.2 desktop-amd64.iso.\nIs it possible that we copy the iso file into our pendrive and then boot it from Pendrive after restarting?\nIf yes, could you please provide me with the steps for that.\nTo be frank, I am not good with the computers\nMy laptop is Lenevo G580\n\nA: Your best bet is YUMI if you're currently running Windows. The process after downloading is very simple; you select the Linux distro you would like to use, and point it to your iso, and begin the process. It also allows for multiple OS to be set up on your USB.\n\nA: (Sorry for the delay in getting this answer to you, while I do have experience with creating BootUSBs, they're made from Ubuntu and I had to be sure my Windows methods still worked =)\nEllie Zffie's answer is technically correct, but the YUMI site even states that the goal of the project is to make the OS bootable but not necessarily installable. That said, it's worth a shot to try it. However, if it doesn't work there is another, more correct (but less user-friendly) solution.\nThe Ubuntu ISO is what's known as a \"hybrid\" ISO. That is, it's an ISO with a partition table just like a hard disk. Recent versions of Ubuntu even have an EFI partition to make it bootable via both EFI and USB. This means that the ISO can be copied directly to a USB drive. This, however, has a couple of drawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will erase all data on the drive\n\n*The USB drive that is the result of the process will have two read-only partitions. It's possible to add additional partitions, but Windows has a tendency to ignore additional partitions on flash media.\n\n*Using dd for Windows is not for the feint of heart and could result in major data loss if done improperly.\n\n\nSo, I don't even recommend that. Luckily, I have experience with building customized Ubuntu BootUSBs. The process to make an Ubuntu USB BootUSB  manually is actually fairly trivial and consists of 3 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract the contents of the ISO to the USB drive\n\n*Run the Syslinux installer\n\n*Rename a file\n\n\nThat's the short version anyway. Here are the exact steps to get a working, guaranteed installable Ubuntu LiveUSB without a read-only filesystem:\nDownload Prerequisites\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Ubuntu ISO.\n\n*Download syslinux. If you're planning on installing 14.04 LTS (Trusty), get syslinux-4.05.zip. For 14.10 (Utopic), or 15.04 (Vivid) get syslinux-6.03.zip.\n\n*Get a copy of an archive extraction tool such a 7-zip for extracting the ISO (I believe that WinRAR and/or WinZip also work for this purpose) and install it.\n\n\nExtract the files\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract syslinux-4.05.zip or syslinux-6.03.zip to your Desktop.\n\n*Extract the ISO contents to your USB drive using 7-zip/WinZip/WinRAR. If you use 7-zip it will create an extra folder called \"[BOOT]\". This isn't necessary to keep.\n\n\nInstall Syslinux\n\n\n*\n\n*Open an administrator command prompt.\n\n*cd C:\\Users\\[Username]\\Desktop\\syslinux-4.05 (or syslinux-6.03 depending on the version you downloaded)\n\n*cd win32 or cd win64 depending on your version of Windows. (Hint: check Computer->Properties)\n\n*syslinux --active --install X: (replace X: with the drive letter of your USB drive)\n\n\nRename the configuration file\n\n\n*\n\n*On your USB drive, locate the \"isolinux\" folder\n\n*Inside this folder, rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg\n\n\nReboot to boot into your new Ubuntu LiveUSB!\n\nA: I downloaded this and now and creater a ubuntu bootable disc\now to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\nTo run Ubuntu from a USB stick, the first thing you need to do is insert a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space into your PC.\nThe easiest way to put Ubuntu onto your stick is to use the USB installer provided at pendrivelinux.com.

APT keeps tracks of which package installed which file and removes them when uninstalling a package. \nYour system doesn't get slower if there are many packages installed (as long as you still have a reasonable amount of free disk space). \nThere is also no system wide registry as in Windows, but a lot of programs have configuration files in /etc. Usually it is better to not touch these files unless you know what you are doing. These configuration files are the only thing not deleted by APT when uninstalling a package (because you might want to use then again in the future). If you want to remove configurations files from uninstalled packages you can either call\ndpkg --purge PACKAGENAME\n\nfor each package you want to remove or use\ndpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ {print $2}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty sudo dpkg --purge\n\nto remove configuration files of all uninstalled packages.

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04. I get into the software Center, I find the app I want, click to install, enter the admin password, it's starts installing and then the process meter stops at like 10% or something.

Now it will not be recognised no matter what usb port or whether I still power it with an AC adaptor as well. I even got a single AB usb 2.0 cable thinking it was having a hard time recognising my usb extension cable. I never have had any issues with usb midi on my desktop and Ubuntu Studio.\nI was wondering if any ever had such issues and how did they resolve it??\n\nA: CL, indeed it was a hardware issue or more specifically, I found out that my laptop usb ports seem to not handle a cable of more than 12 feet!

The symlink .#sum.cpp is used by Emacs to store some internal data (seems like user name, host name and some timestamp)\nAs the target of a symlink is just some short text (that is resolved as a path if you access the symlink's content), symlinks are sometimes used to store small amounts of data. In that case the target most likely isn't a valid file path and you get an error if you try to access it.\nThat's because creating a symlink is an atomic operation: Either the symlink is created with full content or it's not created at all. In contrast creating a regular file and filling it with content is not atomic and in case of an error you may end up with an empty file or only partial content.\n\nA: Symlinks - symbolic links - are files which contains text description of where the target file is relative to the symbolic link.\nIn opposition to hard links, when you delete target files, symlinks are empty.\n\nA: A symbolic link really is just a short text with special \"magic\" happening in the kernel when you open it. Programs can put whatever text they want in there. Whether that text is actually a valid path name doesn't matter when the symlink is being created. The existence of the target only matters when you try to open the symlink.\nEmacs uses this in a slightly different way. It creates a symlink to indicate that the file is open and have unsaved changes. If you start another instance of emacs, it can then warn you about the previous instance already having the file open.\nThe reason for using symlinks for this instead of other methods is that the symlinks also work if the file is on NFS. This is also why the hostname is in the text, that way emacs will know if the file is currently open on this machine or on another machine.\nI guess if you try to edit the file with emacs again, it will notice that the file is supposedly open by an emacs instance on the current machine, but that emacs instance no longer exists, so it must somehow have died. And then emacs can safely ignore the symlink and not give you a warning.\n", "Q: Fresh Virtualmin install - MySQL root password?

I had UEFI Windows 10 then I installed LM 17.2 Cinnamon (Ubuntu based) on the top of it. Grub is functioning normally but I cannot seem to figure out where exactly the Grub files are stored. Can you help?\n\nA: Broadly speaking, there are two possibilities (although clearly only one is the case for you):\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS-mode booting from GPT -- On a BIOS-based computer or an EFI-based computer that uses its Compatibility Support Module (CSM) to emulate a BIOS, GRUB is installed split across the Master Boot Record (MBR; the first sector of the disk), the BIOS Boot Partition, and files in the Linux /boot directory. In some cases, the BIOS Boot Partition code can be placed elsewhere, but Ubuntu pretty much insists on the BIOS Boot Partition being present. Since you don't have this partition on your disk (it shows up as having the \"bios_grub flag\" set in GParted), it's pretty clear that your disk is not set up for BIOS-mode booting.\n\n*EFI-mode booting from GPT -- Under EFI, booting is handled by boot loaders stored on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which shows up in GParted as having the \"boot flag\" set. The ESP is normally mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu, and Ubuntu's GRUB goes in the ESP's EFI/ubuntu directory -- that is, /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu. The computer knows which boot loader to launch because of NVRAM entries, which you can examine and manipulate with the efibootmgr command in Ubuntu. Type sudo efibootmgr to see the existing entries, or add -v to see extended information. You can use -c to add new entries, -B to delete entries, -o to change the boot priority, and so on. (Some of these options require additional options to do any good.) Type man efibootmgr for details. Note that EFI boot loaders are ordinary files; they have no components that are stored \"raw\" in the MBR or partition boot sector, unlike BIOS boot loaders. EFI-mode GRUB still relies on files in the Linux /boot directory tree, though, just like its BIOS-mode counterpart.\n\n\nFor more on the subject of EFI-mode booting, you can read:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry about the principles underlying EFI-mode booting\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on setting up an EFI-mode boot\n\n*My own Web page about EFI boot loaders for Linux\n", "Q: Understanding linux file system modes I've read through over 10 articles, and am trying to wrap my head around the linux file system. There is one point I am trying to get that I can't figure out. Forgive me for sounding very dumb:\nWhen listing file details, I get a numeric \"mode\" of a file, which refers to its permissions. Some example modes:\n33206\n16822\n\nSomehow, those seem to need to convert to octals, and look something like:\n0777\n\nFrom there, one can apparently deduce the human readable permissions, such as:\ndrwxr-xr-x\n-rwxr--r--\n\nI'm trying to figure out how get from this first step to the third. And I'm totally lost.\n\nA: The first set of numbers is probably nothing to do with the permission set for the file. If you got this information using ls -l then that number corresponds to the file size in bytes.\nThe octal values are not displayed in this format, but the 'human readable' is. The way that I remember octals is that the first of the four digits is to do with special bits (setuid, setgid, sticky) these are for more advanced usage, so I wouldn't worry about them straight away. Then each human readable set of rwx makes up the value of the next 3 digits, which are ordered by owner, group and everyone. r=4, w=2 and x=1, so read/write is 4+2=6.\nThe Ubuntu help page is pretty clear I think.\nI'd also suggest using ls -lh to list files, as the file size is converted to human readable, so it's output is in Kilobytes, Megabytes and Gigabytes.\n\nA: If you mean by \"decimal notation\" \"octal notation\": both octal and character notations are communicated between *nix users. \nIn particular notice that in permissions in octal and characters can be split in 3 parts. Like so:\nrwx | r-x | r-x\n7   | 5   | 5\n\nNow look at the position of each letter.\n\n\n*\n\n*In first part, it is true, true, true (or set, set, set). What is number 7 in octal? 111.\n\n*Second permission? set, unset, set. Octal 5? 101. As you can see octal notation in bits corresponds to the letters to set/unset. \nAs for the 3 sets, that's owner, that user's group, and other users and groups permissions. In the example above, owner can read write and execute, but users in owner's group and other users cannot write, they can only read and execute a file.\n\nA: You can get the octals value with:\nstat -c \"%a %n\" file\n\nHowever there is a tons of file permissions calculator online:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://file-permissions.ninja\n\n*http://permissions-calculator.org\nand a lot more...\n\nA: Thanks for all of the help and hints of the other answers.

You can unpack the object files into a directory, from the foo.a file, using the ar tool in a terminal.\nHowever, this still does not allow you to edit the source and make changes. If you want to modify the program in question, then you should find the source code for the upstream project which created the file, and then modify and recompile that source.\nAlso, even if you were able to modify the foo.a file using a hex editor or similar and change the functionality, it would be a virtually useless change, as anything which linked to that file would need to be rebuilt with the new version, to adapt the changes.\n", "Q: How to open a file in text editor through terminal?

I had no clean disk, so I tried to install it from my USB. I went Ubuntu forums and found several ways to write my ubuntu.iso to USB. I had tried a lot of them, but every time I had the next problem: when Ubuntu is only loading, it writes something like No caching mode page found, which is going before Assuming drive cache: write through. After that the Ubuntu logo appears and five white dots under it. For 4 seconds all of them become red, and them nothing happens. The Ubuntu logo is just staying on the screen even after an hour of wating. For all this time the USB indicator is not flashing. I've tried to google this, but I had found nothing. \nThen while searching forums, I found a way to install Ubuntu inside Windows (maybe it is important to mention that I have Windows 7 and Windows 8 installed on my laptop). So I mounted my ISO again and started wubi.exe where there was not any button to install it from inside. After several minutes I've got the issue: I typed H:\\wubi.exe --force-wubi in my cmd, and it worked. I pressed Install Ubuntu inside Windows, followed the instructions, and reached the end of the installation. After this I really got a possibility to choose Ubuntu as the OS, but even than I get the same problem: nothing happens. But this time I got the message, which says that installation of Ubuntu will continue on Ubuntu booting. I can press the Esc key and choose different ways of its loading, but any of the options leads to the same problem.

This may help you resolve issues on certain graphics cards and allow you to boot and install any proprietary drivers needed by your system.\nFrom the purple ubuntu screen press the F6 key. If you don't see this screen, shutdown, boot from the Ubuntu live USB again, and immediately after the motherboard / computer manufacturer logo splash screen appears when the computer is booting, with BIOS, quickly press and hold the Shift key, which will bring up a GNU GRUB menu screen. With UEFI press (perhaps several times) the Esc key to get to the GNU GRUB menu screen. Sometimes the manufacturer's splash screen is a part of the Windows bootloader, so when you power up the machine it goes straight to the GNU GRUB menu screen, and then pressing Shift is unnecessary.\n\nIf the Ubuntu installer either does not start or starts and then freezes, press the F6 key and enable the nomodeset kernel boot option by following the instructions in the nomodeset tag wiki.\n\nRufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc. Rufus can be especially useful in cases where bootable media created in Windows by other GUI Linux live USB creators such as Universal USB Installer and UNetbootin gets stuck and won't boot.

There is some problem when install this OS because I cant connect to wifi so i saw some tutorial about using nautilus keyword and works. I switch to use Ubuntu just now but is Ubuntu more on coding or programming? \n\nA: The Linux culture is to have many tools that can do the same job.\nOur system is strongly connected to server instances so we have situations where users do not have a desktop. We also have situation where servers are on a remote location.\nFor that reason we have a terminal where we can insert commands and have them execute. This can be a simple list of files in a folder (ls) to a editing text files to configure your graphics card.\nThe big plus with this: those commands also work for desktop users. \nOften there is a graphical option to do it from the desktop but those are not uniform across all desktops (we have more versions that do not use Unity as a desktop) so it is easier for someone to post commands on-line for you to use in a terminal. Otherwise he would need to provide images on how to do something in Unity, in KDE or any other desktop. \n\nUnderstanding those commands though should be a must for anyone using Ubuntu. So yes... we are more of a coding/programmers operating system. In that sense we are totally different from Windows. But it is NOT that difficult. Give it a couple of weeks and you will understand all the codes that you need. \nThere are commands that look innocent but can cause trouble though. When you find a piece of code that needs to be inserted into a terminal and you are unsure you can always ask in Ubuntu Chat (20 reputation required).\nAll code in all the questions on AskUbuntu should be safe to use (if applicable) or it should have a big fat warning. Be careful when using destructive commands (like rm (remove) or mv (move) or when they are about formatting partitions and when commands need a password). \n\nA: Ubuntu means humanity, so you can use ubuntu for coding, for high level network engineering, for programming, for design, for film editing, for games, for pentest, for everything you want.\nInstall ubuntu, it's great :D\nDo you want windows applications? install Wine or VirtualBox or VMware.\n\nA: Ubuntu is for everyone. Both the coder, the coding amatuer and the GUI user.\nIn most cases, what you need doing can be done just as well with a GUI rather than the terminal. In some situations, the terminal and a little coding will be needed - but there are a wealth of tutorials out there to provide you with help if you need it.\nIn short, Ubuntu is more on coding if you want it to be, just as Ubuntu is more on GUI if you want it.\nAfter all, Ubuntu is Linux :D\n", "Q: Will upgrading to Gnome 3.16 on 15.04 lead to 'dependency hell' when upgrading to 15.10? I am currently running Ubuntu Gnome 15.04, with Gnome Shell, and Gnome 3.14, but I am thinking about upgrading Gnome from 3.14 to 3.16 using these PPAs:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\n\n*gnome3-team/gnome3\nBut then when I want to upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 15.10, if say it is still running Gnome 3.14, or a higher version, could this lead to what is known as 'dependency hell'?\n\nA: If you are not sure the upgrade will go to plan with the upgrade, you can uninstall the PPA's packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using ppa-purge, selecting it in Synaptic etc) and then upgrade - it should be fine then.)\n\n*Using Synaptic may work on difficult PPAs, as I found out here:\n\nppa-purge is ineffectual with that ppa, (elementary-os/daily) & probably the same with autoremove. I'd add back the ppa & update sources. Then open synaptic > Origin. Click on the entry for that ppa/now. With shift+click highlight all the packages & mark for removal, ect. Then get rid of the ppa. \n\nIt may be more stable to do a fresh install anyway (and this is very easy with a separate /home, the installer may automatically offer to do it for you). It may be more stable to do a fresh install anyway (and this is very easy with a separate /home, the installer may automatically offer to do it for you)) - This has been discussed here. You may be able to do a fresh install after a botched upgrade as well.\nJust make sure when you do upgrade you have a reliable backup of everything (or just what data is important) so if it does go wrong you can restore easily.\n", "Q: How to prevent commands being removed from history? I have noticed that when I go up through my commands using the arrow keys, UP and DOWN, that if I then edit a command, it edits it in history, and I can even remove a command like that, however I do not want it to have this affect on the commands in history, I don't want it to actually delete them in the history, only allow me to edit what I am typing, but not actually modify the history through this. So how can I make it so that this does not actually modify the history, but just the command that I execute?\n\nA: I asked something quite similar in Unix & Linux: How to undo changes in the commands-history?.\nThe great answer I got from Gilles says:\n\nAs long as you've edited a history entry but not pressed\n  Enter yet, to go back to the original entry, repeatedly\n  press Ctrl+_ — the undo command — until it\n  doesn't make any further change. You're back to the original entry.\n\n\nA: I encountered the same problem and while I was playing around and struggling to understand what was happening, I just figured out the following:\nIf you call from the history a command line that you have actually typed earlier in that same current terminal session and then edit it (maybe deleting it) but then interrupt your edit by leaving that (history-)command line using for instance the Down arrow to come back to the prompt of the actual current command line, then later on when you exit the terminal the edits get recorded in the .bash_history file.\nThis behavior does not happen if you edit and interrupt your edit on a command line that was already recorded in the .bash_history file before you started the terminal session.\nIn other words, while a terminal session is open, the newly typed command lines are only kept in memory, not in the .bash_history. You can recall them using the up arrow or invoking the history commands, and you can edit them while the session is open (when invoking the historycommand, the lines of modified commands will then be indicated by an asterisk *). It's only when you exit the session that the commands of the session get recorded 'as is' in the .bash_history file, thereby keeping the last edits you have made on them before exiting the session.\nSee also the answer from falconer there.\n", "Q: List disk partitions I have installed Ubuntu in a Virtual Hard Disk on Windows (5G).

You can not directly mount \"real\" partitions in the virtual machine, and, honestly, you shouldn't.\n\nIf you only want to access some files from within the VM, you can create host-guest shares. If you are using VirtualBox, this can be done by\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the VirtualBox guest additions in the guest system.\n\n*Shut down the VM, open the VM Manager, select the Ubuntu VM and click Settings.\n\n*Go to Shared folders and create a new shared folder.\n\n*Boot the VM. You will find the shared folder in the network environment of the virtual system. You should be able to navigate there with the default file manager in Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nIn case you want to perform some repairs on your Windows partitions, forget it. This cannot be done from within a VM. If you want to natively access these partitions, use a live environment. To do this, extract the Ubuntu installation image to an USB stick using tools like UnetBootin or PendriveLinux. After doing so, you should be able to boot off the USB and do whatever you wanted to do in the VM.\nIf you want to perform file system repairs, it is however the better choice to use Windows' own tools for this, like chkdsk or the automatic repair mechanisms on the installation disk.\n\nA: In linux if you have it installed on VHD your going to be limited to only seeing what's on the virtual hardware that the OS has access to in the virtual environment.\n", "Q: Using two keyboards in KDE with a dedicated layout each (typically azerty / bépo) I need to be able to use two keyboards (one standard AZERTY on my laptop) and a TypeMatrix 2030 USB (BÉPO layout).

Please note that I don't want to lengthily explain why clicking on the «change layout» icon in the taskbar doesn't suit me, and more generally why it is not sufficient for me to have a single hardware keyboard recognised.\nPS: (un)checking \"Configure Layouts\" in the System Settings has no bearing on the problem.\nConfiguration: Kubuntu 14.04 LTS 2 on a Sony VAIO VPCZ23M9E with TypeMatrix 2030 USB keyboard\n\nA: It's an old question, but I wanted to achieve the same as the OP and this works in KDE Plasma 5.19.\nI created the following (executable) script:\n#!/bin/sh\n#set-keyboard-layout.sh\n\n#when using multiple keyboards at once, KDE overrides xorg keyboard configs\n#using this script in autostart can set the correct layout for one of the\n#keyboards again.\n\nKEYBD_ID=\"Logitech HID compliant keyboard\"\nKEYBD_LAYOUT=\"fr\"\nKEYBD_VARIANT=\"bepo\"\n\nsetxkbmap -layout \"$KEYBD_LAYOUT\" -variant \"$KEYBD_VARIANT\" -device $(xinput list --id-only \"$KEYBD_ID\")\n\nChange the variables to suit your needs. Use xinput list --short to find the value to for KEYBD_ID.\nI then added it to KDE Autostart scripts (System Settings > Startup and Shutdown (under Workspace) > Autostart > Add script...)\nIt leaves the laptop keyboard layout as set in KDE, but changes the USB keyboard to its correct layout. It will probably be overridden if you manually change keyboard layouts, but rebooting or logout/login will probably fix it again.\nThanks to this and this answer.\n", "Q: Zenity does not show messages in deb preinst when it is ran through Ubuntu Software Center I am creating a deb package which requires java oracle >= 7.

Is this a trial version? why only 9 months?\nLike I said in the beginning of my post I'm ready to migrate, but not if it's only for 9 months.\nI apologise in advance if this is a stupid question or it's obvious for you, but I don't know anything about ubuntu, so I'd be glad if somebody could clarify that for me.\n\nA: It's not a trial version. The reason why it's only supported for 9 months is this: A new Ubuntu release comes every 6 months anyway. So after a new release comes out, people who want the latest release of Ubuntu should have upgraded anyway, so old versions are only supported for 3 additional months.\nPlease don't be afraid to use the newest Ubuntu release: when a new one comes out in October (which will be 15.10), you can upgrade your 15.04 installation very easily and keep synchronized with the latest Ubuntu release.\nIf you don't want to update every 6-9 months, then as hg8 mentioned, your best option is to use the LTS (Long-Term Support) releases. These are released every 2 years (the last was 14.04, the next one will be 16.04) and are supported and receive security updates for 5 years. \nRead more here (under Management of Relases).\n", "Q: I installed Ubuntu on an external UDS HDD.

I open it, ask it to create the PGP key. I give the password.\nAfter I've given the password nothing happens at all and no key is generated. How can I fix it?\n\nA: As the other answer stated, it simply takes time because not enough entropy (i.e., random data) is generated.\nYou can speed the process up by installing an entropy generator like haveged! \nJust install the package via command line:\nsudo apt-get install haveged\n\nA: You need to wait up to 15 minutes to gather enough entropy.\nJust have some patience.\nIf you keep using the system, move mouse, etc., it will genererate faster.\n\nA: After some time I took another look, in fact the key was being generated for so long.\n", "Q: Clang++ cannot find lstdc++ after system upgrade I have a small project in C++ that compiled fine until I upgraded Xubuntu to 15.04.

Then check if there is complete link hierarchy, e.g. (for stdc++):\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   40 cze 14 12:34 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so -> libstdc++.so.6\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   19 maj 11 02:36 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 -> libstdc++.so.6.0.22\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1,6M maj 11 03:05 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.22\n\nOn Ubuntu sometimes is missing (probably you don't have this first). \n\nA: I have no idea why this is broken (I'm on a fresh Linux Mint installation and I'm getting that error) but I did this dirty fix.\nIn my .bashrc:\nstdcxxpath() { if [ -n \"${stdcxxpath:-}\" ]; then echo \"$stdcxxpath\"; return; fi; stdcxxpath=$(g++ -xc++ /dev/null  -Wl,--print-map 2>&1 |awk '/libstdc\\+\\+.so/ { print $2; exit }'|sed 's|/[^/]*$||'); stdcxxpath; }\nalias clang++='clang++ -L$(stdcxxpath)' #find where libstdc++.so is from gcc and use it\n\nThe memoized stdcxxpath() shell function finds libstdc++ and passes it to the linker used by clang++\n(The simpler: dirname $(locate '*/libstdc++.so') works too although with a bit of a lag.\n", "Q: Boot map is full command: sudo apt-get autoremove does not work: see text jp59@JP59:~$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n[sudo] password for jp59: \nPakketlijsten worden ingelezen...

Using networkmanager and dnsmasq.\nWhen I'm at work I have a wifi connection that is statically configured with IP, dns server, and domain search.\nWhen I connect, resolv.conf has both the server and the domain search, along with the dnsmasq entry of 127.0.1.1.\nWhen I go home and get on my dhcp wifi connection, the domain search is removed from resolv.conf, but the work dns server isn't removed. As a result all my browsing drags. I can manually remove the entry, but when resolv.conf gets rebuilt it's back in there again (I expect that).\nI think the real problem is that when NM connects to the work wifi it should hand the dns server to dnsmasq, not put it in resolv.conf, as a result when I disconnect it doesn't take it out.\n\nA: You write: «When I connect, resolv.conf has both the server and the domain search, along with the dnsmasq entry of 127.0.1.1.»\nThis is improper behavior.\nNetworkManager should give the nameserver address(es) to dnsmasq and not submit them to the resolvconf utility (which manages resolv.conf) and/or write them directly into /etc/resolv.conf.\nNetworkManager itself in Ubuntu behaves correctly, at least under default/normal circumstances. \nAre you using a NetworkManager extention or third-party utility program to configure a VPN or something of that nature? There may be a bug in that extention or utility such that the software sends the work nameserver address statement to resolvconf and doesn't remove it when you leave work.\nThird-party software is often not properly integrated with Ubuntu, and in particular often fails to use resolvconf to add and remove nameserver information.  Read /usr/share/doc/resolvconf/README.gz for information about resolvconf.\n", "Q: rsync from local folder to mounted nfs share causes permission denied errors and nothing is copied I have a home server that is sharing folders on the network using NFS.\nI have mounted these folders on my computer, for example:\n192.168.1.20:/mnt/raiddisk/john  /mnt/john        nfs     auto,defaults   0       0\n\nI am trying to run the following rsync command in order to copy my home folder to the remote machine:\nsudo rsync -azv -h --progress /home/john/ /mnt/john/backups/manual/20150806/ --log-file=/home/john/manual_backup.log\n\nBut I get errors like this one and nothing is copied over:\nrsync: failed to set times on \"/mnt/john/backups/manual/20150806/.\":\nPermission denied (13) rsync: recv_generator: mkdir\n\"/mnt/john/backups/manual/20150806/.Skype\" failed: Permission denied\n(13)\n* Skipping any contents from this failed directory *\n\nThe permissions for my mounted folders are as follows:\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 root root  4096 Aug  2 21:32 mnt\ndrwxrwxr-x  4 john  john  4096 Dez 24  2014 john\ndrwxrwxr-x  4 john  john  4096 Dez 14  2014 backups\ndrwxrwxr-x 6 john john 4096 Aug  6 20:41 manual\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 john john 4096 Aug  6 20:41 20150806\n\nI thought that by using sudo I would be running rsync with root permissions and that it should not have problems copying the files, but evidently there is something I have misunderstood, any help appreciated.\n\nA: One of the \"security\" measures in NFS is rootsquash being a default option. With rootsquash, root on a client system has the same privileges as the nobody user (or some other assigned, impotent, account depending on the exact configuration). Accordingly, using sudo on NFS actually weakens your access privileges. So, don't use sudo on NFS. Set your permissions properly.\n", "Q: Strange Firefox icon during Gnome 3.16 upgrade I am running Ubuntu Gnome 15.04, with Gnome Shell, and 3.16, although I only just upgraded to Gnome 3.16 from Gnome 3.14. And sometime during the upgrade I suddenly noticed this in Firefox:\n\nIt just suddenly appeared before the upgrade was finished (it was in the unpacking stage), and after looking here it appears to be something to do with syncing, but I don't use syncing, so what is this?

A simple way of restricting other users from executing these files, without uninstalling and reinstalling, is by changing the access permissions. \nRun this line of code, replace program with the name of the program you wish to restrict permissions. (Replace /usr/share with the actual location if the file you are restricting isn't in the share file.)\n$ ls -al /usr/share | grep program\n\nOut put is going to be something like \ndrwxr-xr-x   3 ben   adm   102B Feb 12 23:11 program\n\nIn my case, the file is readable and executable by every user, the owner is me (ben), and it belongs to the group adm(administrators).\nWe want the files group to be something that only the admins can access. Use a group that all admins are in (such as adm), and change it using:\n # chown :adm /usr/share/program\n\nNext we wanna change it to only be readable and executable by the owner and the group. \n# chmod 750 /usr/share/program \n\nThat will change the permissions to drwxr-x---\nSuccess! \nThat should do the trick.

I have Windows 10 on an SSD, Xubuntu on another SSD and an HDD for storage formatted as NTFS (this is used to store music, games, documents, pictures etc.). The GRUB2 boot-loader is also on the SSD with Xubuntu. Previously I used this exact set-up with Windows 7 instead of 10 and there were no issues with booting into my desired OS via GRUB2, as well as being able to mount the NTFS storage drive in Linux. \nHere is the problem I am experiencing now:\nAfter about 10 or so boots into Linux, I turn on my computer and the boot order has changed and it wants to boot straight to Windows 10. After changing the boot order back, my NTFS drive will not mount due to the error described, and resolved here: \nCan't Mount NTFS drive \"The disk contains an unclean file system\"\n(I can use the fix provided in the link, but this is a major annoyance as there are dependencies between my Linux OS and the NTFS drive.)\nMy boot device order is USB, Hard-disk, CD-ROM (all non UEFI) followed by others including the UEFI options. For the Hardisk order I want to have Linux, Windows, Storage... but when the boot order gets reset I get Windows, Storage, Linux.\nI have a hunch it has something to do with \"Secure Boot\" and Windows 10, where Windows 10 prevents other bootloaders from functioning. I skipped Windows 8 so I am not familiar with this feature, and after some research I am a bit confused about Secure Boot and how to deal with it. \nSo my question is: How can I prevent Windows 10 from changing my boot order and messing with the mounting of the NTFS storage drive? \nSome other pertinent information:\nSystem Specs \ni7-2600k\n16GB DDR3 \nMSI Z77A-G45 (I updated the bios to the 2013-09-29 version found here: \nhttp://ca.msi.com/support/mb/Z77AG45.html/#down-bios)\nKingston 128GB SSD - Linux\nAdata 128GB SSD - Windows 10\nWD 2TB Black - Storage\nBIOS INFO\nAfter the update in the advanced settings menu there is a Windows 8 features menu. If I enable Windows 8 features I can then choose to enable or disable secure boot, but when enabling Windows 8 features I am forced to boot with UEFI devices and my computer cannot boot. So I have the Windows 8 features toggle set to disabled right now.    \n\nA: The reason for my problems was that Windows Fast Boot was turned ON. I turned it off by going to Control Panel->Hardware and Sound->Power Options->System Settings and deselecting Turn on fast startup under Shutdown Settings. Grub has been loading flawlessly for the past five days and their have been no conflicts between Windows and Linux.\n", "Q: installaton of ubuntu 14.04 on dell precision t7810 fails: No boot device found I want to install ubuntu 14.04 unto a Dell Precision 7810. I created a\nUSB drive using the \"Startup Disk Creator\". Installation went\nsmoothy. Unfortunately, it failed at boot time with \"No boot device\nfound\". \nTo fix it, I booted off the USB drive and use \"Try Ubuntu\". When\nubuntu came up, I installed and ran boot-repair. All seem well (output\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12016810/). Unfortunately, it still fails with\nthe same error.\nThanks for your time and consideration.\n-jk\n\nA: I ran into the same issue installing CentOS and RHEL 6.7.  It turns out that I needed to use a UEFI compatible USB drive.  I used about 4 drives before I found a Kingston DT R3.0 G2 drive that worked.  \nOn a Windows 7 system I used RUFUS 2.3.709 to create a bootable ISO. I know this sounds far fetched but it's something to do with how the non uefi compatible USB drive present themselves during the install that corrupt or damage the MBR.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem while attempting a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on Dell Precision T7910 (BIOS version A06). I installed the Ubuntu on an SSD connected to SATA1. I used UEFI, disabled legacy ROM, with AHCI on and secure boot on, POST in thorough mode. I solved the issue by running boot-repair from a live Ubuntu session (using USB). I simply followed the instruction described here and it worked !\nTo elaborate more on this: after I first installed it, I ran a live session and looked at the /boot folder. It's empty. And in the computer setup session, I saw the boot option with wrong UUID and a link to an .efi file that simply doesn't exist anywhere on my SSD. That's why the computer won't boot.  After boot-repair, necessary folder and files are there and it works.\n\nA: Have you solved this problem? I ran into the same problem with our lab's T7810. After several days of scratching my head, I finally found the cause of this problem and the solution. It seems that dell has forced the UEFI to look for a specific file to boot: \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI . This is a file for the booting of windows OS, so even though the Linux Server system has been installed to the hard drive, the BIOS will still ignore the Ubuntu's booting file, which is located at \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi , causing the problem \"No boot device found\". The solution can be simple: install the Ubuntu server under UEFI mode, boot the installer through DVD or USB again, choose \"rescue system\" or something like that, and run a shell without filesystem. In the command line, mount the hard drive that has been installed with the Ubuntu by \"mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \" (usually it's sda1), and create the required directory by \"mkdir /mnt/EFI/BOOT\", enter the directory \" cd /mnt/EFI/BOOT\", then fake the windows booting file \"cp ../ubuntu/grubx64.efi ./BOOTX64.EFI\" . Then restart the computer, the Ubuntu should be able to boot now.\n", "Q: Should I just Shoot My Laptop? Or am I just Retarted?

ALL medias verified working on multiple other machines) (Ive been at this a month now... Ive tried every variation I can think of, If I wasn't already bald I'd be pulling out my hair... as I'm sure you are by my gross over use of parenthesis and dot.dot.dots)\n-When I boot override or disable all other boot options (BIOS) this is what it says... \"Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\"\n-some how during one of the go's I managed to get a copy of mint 15 installed, same disk wouldn't recognize again (fluke?)\n-This is my big nice expensive top of the line republic of gamers laptop (vs all my other dated and beaten up loosy goosy laptops) and I'd REALLY like to get this resolved (just thought I'd throw that in there)\n-Every OS media I try does the same thing goes straight to grub asking if I want to boot Mint (remember that flukishly installed OKay)\n-For the record I AM prioritizing both the DVD and the USB boot options in BIOS and occasionally disabling everything else (SSD)\n-USBs are not showing up as hard drives in BIOS (thought I'd throw that out there because I had that issue the other day with a little netbook deal)\nSeriously guys I'm at the END OF MY ROPE, I really want to get this machine working again, its the BEST one I have BY FAR, but at the same time I've been at this a month and I'm also growing more and more tempted to pull an office space... I'd really regret that... BUT AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!.... I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!!\nPlease Help Me\n\nA: There seems to be 2 options; 1) Find a way to correct the Grub settings\nor 2) Format both SSD drives and start again.\n  There may actually be some info for the 1st option in the ubuntu docmuentation (community, askubuntu). \n  If 2nd option is decided upon, I would recommend an old boot disk from Win98 or WinME on a floppy. This would make it possible to use fdisk /mbr which should clear the master boot record (and therefore clear Grub). The drives should then be accessible. When reinstalling, Do Windows install first. Grub seems to set up better when Windows partition already exists. \n  There is a part of your question that tells of DVD/USB not being accessible.\nDouble check to see if BIOS 'sees' the optical/usb drives before you start.\nThere is usually a 'Load BIOS defaults' in saving settings that could correct\nnormal BIOS 'errors' and return the drives.\n  Hope this helps and gets you started to fixing this dilemma. \nEdit 8/11/15 \n  Another option would be to format from Win 7 disk. Boot from the Win 7\ndisk and follow setup to a 'fresh' installation. At the time of choosing\nthe drive for Win 7, do a fresh install in the drive where \ncurrent Win 7 installation exists. Be sure to format drive. When install\nis completed, boot into new installation and go to disk management where\nyou should be able to format the ubuntu drive, making empty space\nfor the ubuntu install. Just be certain that ubuntu installs into\nthat space and should have no problems. Also be sure that / and swap\npartitions are created in the ubuntu install.\n  Hadn't thought of this at first. Hope this gets you going.  Craig\n\nA: yes, you should shoot your laptop and get ASUS G550JX instead. but remember to shoot it with a legal handgun. LOL :P  \nuhh... actually no. I think you can always start fresh, formatting all your drives and reinstall everything. but remember, there are different installer for Windows OEM, Retail, ....... (forgot the rest, sorry), but you can always modify one of those ISOs. Google is your friend. I reinstalled Windows 8.1 in my ASUS T100 with Windows 8.1 retail DVD and OEM key, after modifying the ei.cfg (if I remember correctly). You should start there. Also before installing, make sure you have all the drivers ready to install. You don't want more headache, do you? You may also want Windows 10, make sure the installer are ready to upgrade as soon as thw Windows 7 installed. Why, you ask? Remember the rules that Windows doesn't give a f**k about another OS in your disk. \nAfter installing Windows, then install Ubuntu. It should auto detect all OSes inside your laptop. You already have experience with that, I think you already know what to do. \nAlso if the disc still won't boot, try to change your laptop from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, and vice versa. It may help. You didn't specify you got Windows 7 32-bit or 64-bit. the 64-bit ones got EFI.\nHope this helps! \n(but seriously, why Ubuntu on ROG? you didn't use it for gaming? why not Steam OS?)\n", "Q: USB Ports No Longer Working A few days back I had tried to plug a cooling fan into one of my USB ports.

I mean to see the free space during the installation process.\n\n*any advice?\n\nA: You need to install gParted onto a thumb drive http://gparted.org/liveusb.php\nNext, run disk defragmenter in Windows, and you need to get 100% defragmented if possible.\nThen boot off the usb, and resize your 500GB partition to 100GB.\nWhen that is done you should have about 400GB of free space.\n\nIn the installer, there are multiple ways to install.  You want \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\".  It should do everything automatically.\nAnd you don't need to separate partitions anymore.  And you don't need to worrk with logical partitions either.  The installer will take care of everything.\n", "Q: Drive failed in RAID, other drive has SMART errors. Which to trust?

The advantage of it is that it automatically takes care of dependencies and even works across different systems, e.g. I can use my Mint 17.2 (based on 14.04) to fetch packages for a Kubuntu 13.10. apt-offline uses a three step process.\nBut first you have to install apt-offline on both the offline and online system. For the online system, you can simply do\nsudo apt-get install apt-offline\n\nFor the offline system, you may now simply take the package from the online system's cache at /var/cache/apt/archives/ and install it. All dependencies are already installed (python, apt, less). Should it not work, e.g. due to having a really old system, you can get older versions of the package from  here (for current Ubuntu's) or here (for EOL Ubuntu's). Take the Debian archive to the offline computer and install it.\n\nThe three step process\n\n*\n\n*At the offline computer, enter the command\n apt-offline set --install-packages <package1> <package2> ... <packageN>\n\nThis will generate a file called apt-offline.sig. Take this file over to your online computer. Should you be running an old release, make sure, APT's sources.list point to the old-releases server. In this case, this may require internet for a single apt-get update, afterwards never again.\n\n\n*At the online computer, cd to the signature file and run the command\n apt-offline get\n\nthis will download the required packages and their dependencies. Take all downloaded files back to the offline computer.\n\n\n*At the offline computer, cd to the folder with the archives in and run\n sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nActually apt-offline intends the 3rd step to be done differently, but I found this way to work better.\nIn this way, you can not only install Mono on an offline computer, but you have a semi-automated way of installing any package on offline debian-based systems.\n", "Q: Changing prompt from lts to normal I'm currently running 14.04lts but i want to upgrade to 15.04.

If not let me know, but I'm going off of the assumption that you are. If this answer doesn't work, please provide your Windows version and the type of computer you have and I will edit my answer.\nThere are two things you need to do to get it working:\n1) First, go into bios. The method to do this depends on what version of windows you're running, so I'll recommend you Google it. Then ensure that \"Secure Boot\" is disabled and that it is set to \"CSM Boot\" and not \"UEFI Boot\". \nThe bios also depends on what hardware you have, so try Googling it. Then,\n2) Make sure you Turn Off your computer. Windows will typically go to sleep instead of turning off.

Then use GParted to shrink the image to a size smaller than 128 GiB.\nMake no mistake in determining the final image size. You need to take the following into account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserved space outside partitions. For classic \"msdos\" partition tables, there is a 512 bytes gap in the beginning of the disk. For modern GPT partitioning schemes, there exists a GPT table at the beginning and the end of the disk.\n\n*Swap partitions (if any) must be disabled before you can modify it. This can be done from GParted.\n\n*128 GiB is not 128 GB. 128 GiB = 137.4 GB and 128 GB = 119.2 GiB (1 GiB = 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824 bytes, 1 GB = 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000 bytes). Watch for this difference when computing new sizes!\n\n*It is better to be more conservative in your size choice, leaving more space unused. Enlarging is easier than shrinking and reduces the likelihood of having a too large image.\n\n*Your disk image must reside on a separate disk than the destination disk.\n\n*Consults the manual pages of the involved tools if you are not sure. Make a backup of your source image just to be sure!\n\n\nAfter shrinking the partitions inside the disk image, shut down the virtual machine and shrink the disk image qemu-img resize your.qcow2 128G (128 GiB!). If you are not sure, you can also use the virt-resize(1) program instead.\nWhen your disk image has shrunk (you can verify it with qemu-img info your.qcow2), convert it from qcow2 to your raw disk (replace /dev/sdb by your unused SSD):\nqemu-img convert -p -O raw your.qcow2 /dev/sdb\n\nFor GPT partition tables, you might have to repair the GPT table at the end of the disk.\n", "Q: Update from 14.04.2 to 14.04.3 not happening I have Ubuntu version 14.04.2 installed and want to upgrade to 14.04.3 (Kernel 3.19 has few fixes for me)\nWhen I do\ncat /etc/lsb-release\n\nI get\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\n\nBut I still have 3.16 Kernel, I never got any message about upgrade and when I do \ndo-release-upgrade\n\n(either with -d or -p) I get\nChecking for a new Ubuntu release\nNo new release found\n\nI tried to reboot, for the case that I missed the upgrade, but nothing\nI also have set\nPrompt=lts\n\nin\n/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nHow can I get the upgrade?\nThanks ^^\n\nA: Yes. More info here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes#LTS_Hardware_Enablement_Stack\nAnyone wishing to opt into the hardware enablement stack for Trusty may do so by running following command which will install the linux-generic-lts-vivid and xserver-xorg-lts-vivid packages:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-core-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-vivid libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid \n\nIf you are on an amd64 system that boots with UEFI, you will also need the matching signed kernel:\nsudo apt-get install linux-signed-generic-lts-vivid \n\nFor anyone interested, the specifics regarding the exact policies and procedures regarding the support, maintenance, and upgrade paths for the hardware enablement stack has been documented at the following location:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\n\nA: I did some extra googling and found out, that I really have 14.04.3 version already, but the kernel does not upgrade with it automatically.

It just prints \\n.\nMy terminal is gnome terminal 3.6.2.\nFirst I noticed it with echo commands,and then with shell scripts.\nAny suggestions as to why it doesn't work?\n\nA: The answer by Serg solves only the problem with printing newline (echo, printf). If you need to use newline in general in shell scripts here are some suggestions which demostrate use of a newline by storing it to a variable $NL. When the code works correctly echo \"a${NL}b\" then prints:\na\nb\n\nPOSIX compliant sh\nYou can use a literal newline:\nNL=\"\n\"\n\nYou can generate the newline using printf and command substitution:\nNLx=\"$(printf \\\\nx)\" ; NL=\"${NLx%x}\"\n\nThe appending of x and the following removal of it is necessary because the command substitution removes all newlines at the end of the resulting string.\nBash\nIn Bash you can use escape sequences to represent control characters in a string between $' and ':\nNL=$'\\n'\n\nThis is very convenient but unfortunately not portable.\n\nA: By default, the standard GNU version of echo delivered with Ubuntu, doesn't recognize escape sequences. Use the -e flag to enable that.\nCompare the outputs:\nserg@ubuntu(bash):[/home/xieerqi]$ echo \"new\\nline\"\nnew\\nline\nserg@ubuntu(bash):[/home/xieerqi]$ echo -e \"new\\nline\"\nnew\nline\n\nIn general echo in scripts isn't recommended. For instance, mksh version of echo does allow interpreting the escapes. \nFor portability of scripts, use the printf function. \nserg@ubuntu(bash):[/home/xieerqi]$ printf \"new\\nline\\n\"\nnew\nline\n\n", "Q: Fast PC slow Ubuntu I have a fast PC, I built myself with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*i7 3770k\n\n*5 SSD's\n\n*GTX 970\n\n*Corsair AX1200i\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*3 x 27inch 2560 x 1440\n\n\nI installed Ubuntu Studio and had no issues, it ran smoothly, but I wanted the side dock and didn't really like the way it was set up, so I installed Ubuntu 14.04. \nIt seems that it is running slower than it should, if I go to the search bar I can see it slowly show up and typing has a little bit of a delay.. \nTwo of my monitors are working only and one is only stuck in 1080p with the other one in 1440p.

One of them should work and the system should boot.\nYou can also try boot-repair http://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair-cd/home/Home/\n\nA: First, boot from a Ubuntu Live CD or USB\nMount the partition your Ubuntu Installation is on. If you are not sure which it is, launch GParted (included in the Live CD) and find out. It is usually a EXT4 Partition. Replace the XY with the drive letter, and partition number, for example: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt.\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nNow that you've done that, you need to bind the directories that grub needs access to detect other operating systems using the following commands.\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev &&\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts &&\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc &&\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\nNow you need to jump into it using chroot\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow install, check, and update grub.\nThis time you only need to add the drive letter (usually a) to replace X, for example: grub-install /dev/sda, grub-install –recheck /dev/sda.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sdX\nupdate-grub\n\nNow that grub is 'back home' on your computer, you need to exit the chrooted system and unmount the drives\nexit &&\nsudo umount /mnt/sys &&\nsudo umount /mnt/proc &&\nsudo umount /mnt/dev/pts &&\nsudo umount /mnt/dev &&\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nJust restart your computer and you'll be greeted with the default GRUB selection screen. Select Ubuntu and you're done!\n\nA: Hey I just had the very same issue so I am posting my solution in case someone face it again.\nI had a dual boot Windows 7 / Ubuntu 12.04. While trying to upgrade to Windows 10 I faced the grub rescue console and the same situation as this guy here.\nFirst I tried to use it to solve my problem, but I couldn't find any partition containing my grub boot. Then I used Grub Boot Repair to repair my Grub boot which allowed me to complete my upgrade to Windows 10 as it was on the only bootable partition. You can use Rufus for example with a 2GB USB Drive to make your device bootable and change your boot priority in your BIOS.\nIn the mean time, I used GParted which happen to be on the Grub Boot Repair linux distribution and noticed that in fact my partition of Ubuntu was unallocated. So once I finished the upgrade, I used Free Minitool Partition Wizard as suggested by this guy to recover my partition directly from Windows 10.\nAfter that, I used Grub Boot Repair once again to re-enable my original Grub Boot and bingo.\n", "Q: How can I use Command /Script to show last week images in same folder or to move those weekly basis images to another folder? I have large image files in one folder (e.g 10000 pics ) and I want to check the last week image files (.jpg) so that I can easily move those last week images to the external hard disk instead of transferring all image files (.jpg) to hard disk. Please can anyone help me in this matter. Thank you\n\nA: There's a command called find which can help to identify the files, and even move them to another location.\nTo find .jpg files that are older than 7 days, and list the names of the files:\nfind /path/to/images -name \"*.jpg\" -mtime +6\n\nThe -mtime part of the command looks for files based on the number afterwards in days, +6 means older than 7 days due to the way -mtime rounds non full days down. More info on that is listed in this answer.\nIf you'd like more information on the files use find's -ls option like so:\nfind /path/to/images -name \"*.jpg\" -mtime +6 -ls\n\nOnce you're happy that these are the files you'd like to move, the following command will take care of that, just remember to change '/path/to/images' and '/path/to/external_drive' for the correct values. Using absolute paths is recommended.\nfind /path/to/images -name \"*.jpg\" -mtime +6 -execdir mv \"{}\" /path/to/external_drive \"{}\" \\;\n\nIf there are sub-directories in your image directory that you don't want to search, you can restrict directory recursion with --max-depth 1 put this option after '*.jpg' separated by a space.\n", "Q: How to Install Justinmind Prototyper in ubuntu I want to install Justinmind Prototyper to my Ubuntu 12.04\nHow can i Install Justinmind Prototyper tool in my Ubuntu 12.04 PC\nhttp://www.justinmind.com/\nIs there any way to install this tool in ubuntu\n\nA: JustinMind does not seems available for Linux.

If yes, how can I use juju version 1.23 locally but version 1.22 remotely?\n\n*If I am using Windows Juju client 1.23 and performed bootstrap, what version of Juju gets installed on the remote or on the bootstrapped node? \n\nA: The first thing that bootstrap does is to provision a machine through the cloud provider that matches the constraints you specified.\nWhen the machine has booted, the client connects to the machine through SSH to run the provisioning script. This installs some packages, downloads and unpacks the 'tools', executes the jujud command with the bootstrap arg which initializes the mongo database. It installs the machine agent, and waits for it to start up.\nBy default, the same version as the client is attempted. The 'tools' are downloaded from streams.canonical.com, which has signed tools files for Juju.\nI believe it is possible to specify a different version to be installed.\njuju help bootstrap\n\nShows the following:\noptions:\n--agent-version (= \"\")\n    the version of tools to initially use for Juju agents\n\nSo you should be able to do the following:\njuju bootstrap --agent-version=1.22.6\n\nThe tools are downloaded by default from streams.canonical.com the same way whether you are using Ubuntu or Windows.\n", "Q: Will 14.04.3LTS automatic be upgraded in my 14.04 TS?

I'm having some difficulty with bridging in KVM, while trying to sort it out I have noticed something strange, My server has always had the IP address 192.168.1.140, this persists when i reboot, always. \nYet when in /etc/network/interfaces\ni notice that is is set up:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nSo is there somewhere else that this ip address could have been assigned?\n\nA: Your KVM host is probably running the libvirt-bin service (the default Ubuntu way of running KVM guests). This service runs a dnsmasq instance for the virbr0 interface (default network configuration for libvirt). Dnsmasq is a service to provide DHCP and basic DNS recursion. So, basically, your KVM host is running a 'simple' DHCP server for the KVM guests in the virtual network named default (by default). In virt-manager it looks like this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, dnsmasq will 'cache' the DHCP leases provided to clients (KVM guest in your case). So if a client asks for an IP again before the lease is expired, it will be assigned with the same one as before. This assignment is based on the MAC address of the client. The MAC address of the virtual network card of the KVM guest is set when you create/define a KVM guest with a network interface (or add an interface to an existing guest).\n\n*Secondly, your DHCP client caches the previous lease and in successive DHCP requests it will ask for the IP it got before (which will probably be honoured if the DHCP server client IP pool isn't exhausted).\n", "Q: Unity Panel not showing in 14.04 when I log in to my account, it only shows the wallpaper and one folder I have on the desktop.

The Ubuntu machine name is \"ubuntucomp.net\". Sendemail is the only mail package that doesn't require an MTA and full registered domain address. My VM Ubuntu machine does not have a registered domain because I only want to send email within our local network. \n\n*Email is outgoing only from ubuntu.net. There is no need to receive email.\n\n*I use Sendemail from the command line to send emails with attachments, which are backups of Perl files. Backups are run by cron and the job backs up files and emails them to my work address, me@mywork.com, within our network. \n\n*smtp.mywork.com uses a non standard port, 2500, which I specify on the sendemail command line: sendemail -f me@mywork.com -t me@mywork.com -u \"Perl test ubuntu backups $zipfile\" -s smtp.mywork.com:2500  -l $basedir/smtp.log -S /usr/sbin/sendmail -a $zipfile  < $basedir/mailbody.txt\n\n*Sendemail seems to use /usr/sbin/sendmail. \n\n*The new smtp server Sendemail does not work with is smtp.mywork.com. It requires no username and no password for authentication, but the From: address must be \"me@mywork.com\". \n\n*I will never have admin access to smtp.mywork.com, and no one else does either. So let's not go there. I have to work around this. I know it's silly, but there's nothing I can do about that. \n\n*Also, the new smtp.mywork.com works fine with my other perl programs running on this same machine, but not with sendemail from the command line.\n\n\nSendemail worked fine with one Godaddy server, but now I have to change servers to use one in our own network, call it smtp.mywork.com, set up by someone else. Also, the new smtp.mywork.com works fine with my other perl programs, but not with sendemail.

It's complicated by the fact that the image sequence names vary, as does the starting number of the sequences, but the real problem is I'm new to bash scripting. Here is an example of the files:\ndirectoryFirstRender01\n     renderOne0032.png\n     renderOne0033.png\n     renderOne0034.png\ndirectoryFourthRender01\n     renderFour4253.png\n     renderFour4254.png\n     renderFour4255.png\ndirectoryFifthRender01\n     renderFiveTwo1367.png\n     renderFiveTwo1368.png\n     renderFiveTwo1369.png\n\nHere is a rough outline of the script that has several problems that I know about and probably many more that I don't. The reason I don't know how many problems it has is because I've gotten stuck getting and parsing the filenames, and without that working I can't test the rest:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor DIR in (ls -d */); do\n    1STFILE=(ls $dir/ | sort -n | head -1)\n    STARTNO=${1STFILE:(-8):4}\n    IMGSEQ=${1STFILE%????.*}\n    EXTEN=${1STFILE*.}\n    ffmpeg -start_number $STARTNO -i $IMGSEQ%04d.$EXTEN $DIR.mkv\ndone\n\nMy current main problems that I know about are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know how to get the filename of just the first file in the directories. ls dir/ | sort -n | head -1 works in the terminal, but not in a script.\n\n*The substring extraction for getting the first number of the first file would only work on image sequences of 4 digits. Is there a way to make it accept renderSix00001.png-renderSix99999.png and renderSeven001.png-renderSeven999.png too? That's also a problem with the line getting $IMGSEQ, and the %04d in the ffmpeg line would need to be changed somehow.\n\n*I think I'm going to have trouble with the $IMGSEQ variable mixing with the %04d in the ffmpeg input filename without brackets, but I haven't gotten that far yet. What syntax do I use there $IMGSEQ(%04d).$EXTEN or $IMGSEQ {%04d}.$EXTEN maybe? (Stuff like this is why it sucks to be jumping in the deep end of scripting)\n\n*(minor problem: 1. I know using ls in for DIR in (ls -d */) is frowned upon, but I don't know how else to filter out any files in the present working directory and just work on the directories.)\n\n\nI'm sure the script looks like a complete mess. Any overall guidance to get the whole thing working would be very welcome, but if no one has the patience to walk me through the whole thing if I can just get some help getting and parsing the filenames maybe I can fix the rest myself. Thank you.\nUPDATE 1: (After applying Ron's suggestions)\nThank you again Ron! This is the near-final script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor DIR in $(ls -d */)\ndo\n    FIRSTFILE=$(ls $DIR | sort -n | head -1)\n    STARTNO=$(echo $FIRSTFILE | grep -Eo \"[0-9]+\")\n    DIGITNO=${#STARTNO} \n    IMGSEQ=${FIRSTFILE%????.*}\n    EXTEN=${FIRSTFILE#*.}\n    OUTPUT=${DIR%/}\n    ffmpeg -start_number $STARTNO -i \"$DIR$IMGSEQ\"%0\"$DIGITNO\"d\".$EXTEN\" $OUTPUT.mkv\ndone\n\nSince thanks to Ron the $STARTNO variable will now accept multiple digit lengths, I'm using the length parameter expansion in the $DIGITNO line to get the number to use in the %04d part to make it %03d or %05d as needed so that will work too. I'm hoping the liberal use of \" to separate the %04d from the surrounding variables isn't considered bad form (if it was, what is the right way?). The ONLY missing part of the script (I think!) is how to make $IMGSEQ accept multiple digit lengths. I have no ideas for that right now. If anyone knows, I would appreciate knowing, but maybe I can find it combing through parameter expansion documentation, as if I haven't had more than enough of that for one lifetime. :)\nUPDATE 2: (Success!)\nFigured it out! (How to get IMGSEQ to accept names involving multiple digit lengths that is) Working based on Ron's suggestion for $STARTNO using (echo $FIRSTFILE | grep -Eo \"[0-9]+\") I came up with\nIMGSEQ=$(echo ${FIRSTFILE%.*} | grep -iEo \"[a-z]+\")\n\n\n\n*\n\n*${FIRSTFILE%.*} takes the first file and strips off the extension.\n\n*grep is pattern searching\n\n*The -i part of -iEo is to make grep accept uppercase and lowercase pattern matches.\n\n*The -E part of -iEo is to (quoting from man grep) \"Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression.\" Whatever that means.\n\n*The -o part of -iEo is to only print the matching pattern.\n\n*[a-z] is to match the pattern of any letter of the alphabet\n\n*+ tells grep that the previous alphabet pattern should be matched \"one or more times\" (so do it over and over to get all the letters).\n\n\nA limitation of that is that it wouldn't handle filenames with special characters like - or _, but I can live with that for now.\nSo here is the semi-final script!\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor DIR in $(ls -d */)\ndo\n    FIRSTFILE=$(ls $DIR | sort -n | head -1)\n    STARTNO=$(echo $FIRSTFILE | grep -Eo \"[0-9]+\")\n    DIGITNO=${#STARTNO} \n    IMGSEQ=$(echo ${FIRSTFILE%.*} | grep -iEo \"[a-z]+\")\n    EXTEN=${FIRSTFILE#*.}\n    OUTPUT=${DIR%/}\n    ffmpeg -n -start_number $STARTNO -i \"$DIR$IMGSEQ\"%0\"$DIGITNO\"d\".$EXTEN\" $OUTPUT.mkv\ndone\n\nSo run in a directory with some directories named like my example directories above (except I added one with an image sequence padded with more than 4 zeros to make sure that worked too), this script will run the following ffmpeg lines one after the other:\nffmpeg -n -start_number 0032 -i directoryFirstRender01/renderOne%04d.png directoryFirstRender01.mkv\nffmpeg -n -start_number 4253 -i directoryFourthRender01/renderFour%04d.png directoryFourthRender01.mkv\nffmpeg -n -start_number 01367 -i directoryFifthRender01/renderFiveTwo%05d.png directoryFifthRender01.mkv\n\nFreakin' perfect!

However I very quickly went from Windows to Linux and then adopted i3. However, as efficient and powerful as it may be, I find it ugly and not very user-appealing. At this link I found a bunch of raw data to customize the i3-wm appearance. Naive and noobie as I am I just threw all of that into ~/.i3/config and relogged, and a bunch of errors came up.\nWhat I want to know is if there is a simple, quick way to download and use a pre-made i3 theme,or if I'm going to need to delve deep into core programming mechanics to understand all that stuff.\n\nA: There are no themes like for example in KDE, Xfce or fluxbox with different title bar styles, animations, rounded corners, etc..\ni3 is a minimal window manager and - by design - offers only a limited amount of options to modify appearance. Those being the font, colors, border width and whether or not to display borders and/or title bar.\nAlso, you have to keep in mind, that the i3 configuration file (most of the time this is ~/.i3/config) does more than just change the appearance of i3. It also contains all other settings like shortcuts, default layout, special behavior for certain programs, etc.. While you certainly may use other peoples configuration as inspiration, it is often not a good idea to just copy any configuration verbatim: You may not have the font defined there, outputs may have different names, some executables may not exist on your system, and so on. Also, what works well for some guy on the Internet, may not work at all for you.\nBut on the plus side, you will not have to \"delve deep into core programming\" to configure your i3. For one thing, the i3 configuration is not a program, just a list of settings, all of which are explained in the excellent i3 User's Guide. There is also no need to set up everything at once. I would suggest to start out with the default configuration file, which should work on any setup (can usually be found at /etc/i3/config; also, if memory serves, i3 should ask you if you want to create a configuration at ~/.i3/config if there is none). Then you can just add or edit whenever you want to change something.\nFor example, if you want to change the colors. Just add the example block from the User's Guide and modify the colors to your taste. Save the configuration file and reload the configuration with i3-msg reload (In the default configuration this is bound to Alt+Shift+C), there is no reason to re-login.\nTL;DR\nThere is no such thing as themes for i3 only whole configurations. Taking any configuration from the Internet may or may not work. But making your own is not that hard. It is probably best to start out with the default configuration (/etc/i3/config) and modify it with help of the User's Guide and just take inspirations from other configurations instead of copying them whole.\n\nA: if you wish, you can try a small program I wrote called i3-xfce. It will install a working theme on your desktop with a bunch of small utilities.\nYou can install it by typing the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-respository ppa:ansible/ansible\nsudo add-apt-respository ppa:aacebedo/i3-xfce-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install i3-xfce\nsudo i3-xfce install\n\nMore informations here: http://www.github.com/aacebedo/i3-xfce\nRegards :)\n", "Q: How do I install DKMS (and others) for my NVidia drivers on Vivid?

I'm desperate for Photoshop now, and since my Wacom is coming soon, I'd like to have Photoshop to work with it.\n\nA: This is the answer your actual question, but please see all the comments above and understand that you cannot simply install Photoshop CS6 directly on Ubuntu.\nYou say you are \"downloading\" Photoshop CS6 as opposed to installing from disc. If it is coming from a legit source like Adobe.com AND you downloaded the Windows not Mac version, you'll have downloaded two large files (about 1.0 - 1.1 GB each), one is a .7z file and one a .exe file. The .exe file will not be called \"setup.exe\" but will have a longer name like \"Photoshop_13_LS4.exe\" or similar. You double click this file to begin the installation.\nBut again, please see the advice provided in the comments before you do this otherwise it will not work for you at all.\n", "Q: How do I fix desktop size?

I can successfully run Minecraft.jar using OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime, but when it comes to playing on multiplayer servers and even singleplayer worlds, I only get 1, or very rarely 2 fps. Sometimes it even sinks down to 0 fps. I have 2 GB of RAM allocated to the machine, and I can't increase it because my host machine, Windows 10, only has 4 GB of RAM. Is there any way I can make Minecraft run faster on Lubuntu, or should I just give up and try to run it on my host machine?\n\nA: There are various things that can affect the performance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Available RAM: 2GiB seems little, but is certainly doable when using the Optifine mod.\n\n*Video memory: Apart from computation memory, games also need lots of video memory to store vertex buffers etc. You should be able to set the amount of video memory in the VM's settings. Also turn on 3D hardware acceleration, if available.\n\n*Rendering method: Minecraft uses two different rendering methods: Vertex arrays, which is a bit slower, but saves on video memory, and Vertex Buffer Objects, which is faster but uses more video memory. This can be changed in Minecrafts settings at Video settings→Use VBOs.  Here you can try which works better.\n\n*Network performance: As you say it is particularly slow on multiplayer servers, this could be a network-related issue. VirtualBox uses a NAT by default, which manipulates each packet. If you change that to 'bridged adapter', the VM can directly communicate with the network adapter, which might be faster. But you may lose network connection on your host while the VM claims the adapter.\n\n*Virtual Machine: VM's just are slower than natively running systems.\n\n\nTo sum it all up, I'd say that you won't ever receive a decent FPS with that configuration; VM's weren't made for gaming. Best try running Minecraft on the host system. For Windows 10, there is a native client, which I heard to be very fast.\n", "Q: Error while updating R in ubuntu 14.04 trusty I am trying to install R programming language and able to install rbase using this code\nsudo apt-get install r-base\n\nAfter that i tried to upgrade it using this code\nsudo add-apt-repository ‘deb http://star-www.st-andrews.ac.uk/cran/bin/linux/ubuntu/trusty/’\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nBut when i tried the first code\nsudo add-apt-repository ‘deb http://star-www.st-andrews.ac.uk/cran/bin/linux/ubuntu/trusty/’\n\nits giving this error\nError: need a single repository as argument\n\n\nA: I don't know where you copied those commands from, but they subsituted pretty quotes (‘’) instead of '.

Can anyone give me a step-by-step on how to fix this?\n\nA: Nothing you can do to fix.  Your Linux install has been, shall we say, obliterated.\nYou can reinstall, but you'll have to resize partitions with gParted live.\n", "Q: How to Increase Home Folder Size in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS? I want to expand home partition refers that folder will be full.\nI've been looking this problem on the internet, it was told to boot over \"the gparted live cd/usb\", but still can not expand its size.\nThis is the video when I boot through Gparted live usb/cd, but still can't increase the size of my home partition.\nAnd this is picture of my partition setup gparted live on ubuntu :\n\n\nA: Here are some simple steps for you to perform right where you were in the video (assuming you really were booting from live cd/usb and that /dev/sda6 really is the partition you have mounted on /home ).\n\n\n*\n\n*Move /dev/sda3 to the \"right\" far enough to leave unallocated space between it and /dev/sda2 equal or greater to the amount of space you wish to add to /dev/sda6.\n\n*Increase the size of /dev/sda6 to use up as much of the unallocated space directly to the \"right\" of it as you wish to add to that partition.\n\n\nNote 1: It is possible that you have to separately increase the size of /dev/sda2 prior to step 2. This depends on whether or not gparted implicitly extend /dev/sda2 as you attempt to extend a partition within it. \nNote 2: Moving the beginning sector of a partition to the \"right\" can potentially take a very long time due to the fact that all of the data on that partition will need to be moved, so be patient.\nNote 3: If /dev/sda3 is your root partition, you will need to use chroot to re-install grub prior to rebooting, because grub points to a specific sector on your HDD/SDD, at least if it's not using EFI.\nInstructions on how to do this can be found in my answer to this question:\nProblems restoring grub\n\nA: Looking at your setup, I believe you are having a MBR disk and therefore am using a extended partition. This is why you were experiencing the problem. The limitation with MBR is that you can't have more than 4 primary partitions. So what is usually done when you want more than 4 partitions on a MBR disk is to create 3 primary partitions, and make the fourth one an extended partition. Now inside the extended partition you can create multiple logical partitions. \nThis is the setup you have. You had sda1, sda3 and the windows partition as primary partitions and sda2 is your extended partition within which you have sda5 and sda6 (logical partitions).\nWhenever you want to increase the size of a logical partition, you need to first increase the size of the extended partition within which it is contained, and then increase the size of logical partitions in it. \nEven if you did not understand what I just told you, never mind, I will walk you through the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't modify partitions that are mounted. So the first step is\nto right click on each partition with a 'key' symbol next to them\nand unmount them.\n\n*Move sda3 to the right to create enough unalocated space between\nsda6 and sda3.\n\n*Now you should be able to expand sda2, your extended\npartition to take up the free space. \n\n*Finally Expand the size of your home(sda6) partition.\nA Tip: You could use a bit more swap space to increase your system performance. So while you are at it, before step 3, move the existing sda6 1 or 2 GB to the right and expand your swap space.\n", "Q: How can I install .exe files of Windows 7 or more in Ubuntu?

You can install it in Windows 7 or higher.\n\nHow can I configure which Windows version (XP, Vista, 7, 8, ...)

After setting the WINEPREFIX, etc. (if you don't know what that is, you don't need to), run winecfg:\n\nSelect Windows 7 from the Windows Version drop-down menu and click OK.

Previous the upgrade, my bashrc file was modified in order to add some Path configuration.\nWhile executing do-release-upgrade everything was fine until a message prompted about the status of the bashrc file and an option menu was displayed. \nFrom the menu, I chose the \"compare changes\" option and the only difference was my previous modification. No problem. \nHere is the problem: I ctrl-c and the whole upgrading stopped. After that, I rebooted my computer and from then it is possible to start Ubuntu only in recovery mode. \nAfter logging in (in recovery mode shell) the welcome header message says \"Welcome to Ubuntu 15.04\" but the \"your Ubuntu release is not supported any more\" and \"new release '15.04' available\" warnings still appear.\nI've tried to do-release-upgrade again but got the \"no new release found\" message.\nHow can I finish or re-run the upgrade??\nThanks\n\nA: This worked for me (running this after a reboot) it started off where the upgrade was interrupted.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n\nA: You have already partially installed 15.04. There is no point in doing a do-release-upgrade any-more, and it will naturally say \"No new release found\".\nWhat you need to do it is the below command which will install the missing packages, assuming apt-get is installed in the first place:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Finally, it's solved. For those who have same or similar problem:\nIn the recovery mode shell: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nIt took a couple of minutes and after reboot \"starting version 219\" message appeared. So I followed this link: \n\nYou may get such an error if your display manager is not sddm. Running the following can show which display manager you are using :\n  cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager\nFor example, if your display manager is /usr/sbin/gdm, running the following may help : sudo systemctl enable gdm.service -f\n\nAfter rebooting, I got \"Failed to start user service user@1000.service\", then followed this thread: \nsudo apt-get purge fglrx*\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates*\nAnd now everything is fine.\n", "Q: Removing everything from my Ubuntu install, even GUI..? I've got an interesting question today. I want to remove EVERYTHING from my Ubuntu install (or remove the OS and just add an empty kernel), but in either case I don't know exactly how. I want a totally primitive system that I can then add too from the ground up, just a kernel with its built in library of functions.\nThere are two reasons I want to do this. The first is to learn the command line in a \"do or die\" environment, both to expand my current knowledge in general and, since I 'tweak' around the system a lot, prepare myself for the inevitable. So, assuming I've already backed up, could someone help walk me through dumping everything from the system, including GUI, so the system is a CLI only (much like hitting the key combo CTRL + ALT + F#).\nNote: I don't have any CD's or USB's at the moment so I can't install some other linux OS, I just want to keep what I have on here and just take its clothes off.\nAlso, I do understand I can change my /etc/default/grub file and change the line \"....\"quiet splash\" to \"text\", but that's not what I want. I actually want to build it myself. So instead of having to search and ask \"What's installed on here and do I need it?\" I can just say \"What do I need to install on here?\"\n\nA: Install Ubuntu server if you don't want a desktop environment. You can always install Unity later by:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIt would run almost similar to Ubuntu Desktop after you install Unity. See this answer here for differences between server and desktop version of Ubuntu.\nBut this is completely different from what you asked for. For one thing, you can't do anything with just the kernel. What you are asking for is Ubuntu Core. More information here.\nIf you are comfortable enough with linux and not a beginner, you can try Arch Linux. It is a linux distribution which is an answer to your question, and also it has a very good documentation on how to do what you want.\n", "Q: How to exit the virtual terminal? After I press ctrl + alt + f4 the virtual terminal appears but I can't exit anymore because it is always back to \"input username\" and \"password\". Any idea how to go back to my desktop?\n\nA: To log out of a virtual console, you need to type exit.\nYour Desktop Environment will be started in one of the virtual terminals. On Ubuntu, it is on tty7. So to get to it, press Ctrl + Alt + F7 (F2 since 17.10).\n\nA: I tried all the other answers here, and none worked for me (Ubuntu VM) \nTo fix it, I logged in with my credentials and typed init 6 and chose to load the Ubuntu OS.\n\nA: Usually one virtual terminal (1 and 2, or 7) are reserved for the graphical environment, so to come out of a virtual terminal either try CTRL + ALT + F2 (F1 for login screen) or CTRL + ALT + F7.\n\nA: @Kerth G. if you press these buttons: Ctrl+Alt+(F1 to F6), you will get TTY, to exit from that you have two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F7, if you have function keys enabled press Ctrl+Alt+Fn+F7.\n\n*Log into TTY with your user credentials, then in TTY type command: init 5, press Enter, now you will get Graphical User Interface.\n\n", "Q: Leoxsys USB Wireless Adapter not detected in lspci I bought a Leoxsys USB Wireless Adapter for my laptop (Kubuntu 15.04) and installed the required drivers.

I've been trying to get Tor browser but have had some complications. I've downloaded the file and saved it to my desktop \nI've tried several commands trying to get into the created directory and install the browser:\ncd tor-browser-linux64-4.5.3_en-US\n\nI've used variations of this file name to include the .tar, to include .desktop at the end and various other things.\nI've also tried to the command\ntar -xvf <TAR_FILE_NAME>\n\nand all return with the message of \"No such file or directory\". What's the deal??\nI'm running a 64-bit OS and downloaded the 64-bit version. I can open the folder and view the various files. I'm not skilled in Ubuntu syntax whatsoever.\n\nA: You need to download the tor browser bundle. You can get it from here.\nWe will cd into that folder to which you downloaded the file. Assuming it is your Downloads directory, open a new terminal and type:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nNow we extract the contents of the file:\ntar -xvf tor-browser-linux64-*.tar.xz\n\nIt creates a new folder called tor-browser_en-US. We cd into this folder. This is important as the script to start tor browser should be executed with the present working directory as this folder:\ncd tor-browser_en-US\n\nFinally we start the browser:\n./start-tor-browser.desktop \n\nOr you could ignore the last two steps, browse to the folder tor-browser_en-US from the GUI and click on Start Tor Browser\n\nA: Using the Tor Browser Bundle via PPA, the simplest way.\n\nTor Browser Bundle is a web browser based on Firefox ESR (Firefox with\n  extended support), configured to protect users' privacy and anonymity\n  by using Tor and Vidalia, tools that come bundled with it. The bundle\n  also includes 4 Firefox extensions: TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript\n  and HTTPS-Everywhere.\n\nOpen a terminal and start the command below\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/tor-browser\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tor-browser\n\nAfter that, start the browser via Dash.\nSource\n\nA: I would recommend using torbrowser-launcher. It may be available via your distribution's package manager but that is probably out-of-date so I strongly recommend you install via PPA.\nIt will download the most recent version of the Tor Browser Bundle, automatically update (preserving your bookmarks and preferences), and verify the TBB's GnuPG signature.

I am contemplating putting these icons on a diet too, however before I start on their diet plan, I am going to try whatever you guys have on offer... So the problem at hand is that although I have now fixed this: How to make Nautilus icons in Gnome 3.16 less fat?\nI am still unable to do the same for the desktop while not in Nautilus so icons look like this:\n\nSo that is really my question, without putting these icons on a diet, how do I shrink them down to normal size like they were in Gnome 3.14 and like I achieved in my other question?\n\nOS Information:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.04\nRelease:    15.04\nCodename:   vivid\n\n\nA: The icon size settings for the desktop are the same as for the icon size in Nautilus for Icon View Defaults.\n\n\nFor smaller or bigger sizes, use the next steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Right Click the desktop icon\n\n*Select Resize Icon…\n\n*Left Click the resize handlers at the edges of the wire frame\n\n*Resize the icon\n\n\nYou can restore the original size with \n\n\n*\n\n*Right Click the desktop icon\n\n*Select Restore Icon's Original Size\n\nIf that doesn't work though, you really should think about changing their diet... ;-)\n\nA: In nautilus click on an icon then with CTRL mouse scroll you can resize the icon size.

(Yes, they hard-coded icons sizes.)\n**** INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAUTILUS 3.20.4 ON UBUNTU-GNOME 17.04 ****\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the following dependencies:\nsudo apt install libgd-dev autotools-dev libexif-dev libexempi-dev libselinux1-dev libtracker-sparql-1.0-dev libext-dev libxml2-dev libgnome-desktop-3-dev\n\nEach one installs a bunch of other stuff, so hopefully I've given you the correct parent package name. I apologize for not recalling with 100% accuracy exactly what I installed, but this looks fairly correct to me immediately after my install. (Notify me if I'm inaccurate anywhere.)\n\n*Download from the Nautilus snapshots website the version of Nautilus that you are currently using. To find that out, run \"nautilus --version\" from the terminal. After downloading the archive, unzip it to whatever directory you want to work from.\n\n*From within the unzipped package, open the file \"nautilus-icon-info.h\". Within the first several lines you will see various sizes designated for the particular scroll-setting options. For instance, within the file for version 3.20.4 the icon sizes start on line 36. Change each of those levels to whatever you want to use so that you can make the icons much smaller (or larger).\n\n*After editing and saving the file, it's time to configure, compile, and install. Run the following commands from the terminal from within the base directory of the version of nautilus that you have downloaded and unzipped. Make sure that you are within the base of the folder structure of the nautilus directories!\n./configure  \nmake  \nsudo make install\n\nThis can be run altogether with the command ./configure && make && make install.\nIf the ./configure command fails it's because you are missing some other dependencies. I apologize if my list of dependencies above was incomplete. Google (or whatever search engine you want) to find what package it is that you need. You can use Synaptic to search for what you need if you're unsure even after Googling.\n\n*Once installed, I suggest a reboot just to make sure that every single thing is reloaded properly. You can now tweak your icon sizes as you wish.\n\nA: As of Gnome 3.36, the default way to change the Desktop icons size is through the Gnome Extensions settings for Desktop Icons. There are only three options: Small, Standard and Large, with Small meaning an icon of size 48 px inside a 120 px by 98 px padded box.\n\nThis can be changed by editing the file located at\n/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/desktop-icons@csoriano/prefs.js\n\nand changing the values of ICON_SIZE, ICON_WIDTH and ICON_HEIGHT.\nAfter you have saved your changes, restart the Gnome shell by pressing Alt+F2 and then running r at the prompt. This should immediately have visible effects on your desktop icons.\n\nP.S. You can find a detailed walkthrough over at ubuntuhandbook.org.\n", "Q: How to handle QML application shutdown? I need to persist the state of a QML application when it shuts down, and to read it when the application loads.\nI tried using Component.onCompleted and Component.onDestruction inside the MainView's Page.\nWhile this works fine on the desktop, on the device it doesn't: Component.onDestruction doesn't get called when you close the app.\nWhat's the proper way of handling the application lifecycle?\n\nA: Ubuntu components include the StateSaver capability.  This allows QML properties to be saved at program exit and restored at restart.  For each element with properties you wish to save, set the StateSaver.properties property to a comma separated list of the properties that should be saved.\nHowever, there are two enormous limitations of the StateSaver.  First, state will not be restored if you program is launched through the Uri handler.  Second, no state will be saved when your program is \"closed properly\".  I have no idea what counts as closing properly, and therefore I don't know how to test this.\nAs I was trying this out, I stumbled on something strange: If you set a StateSaver property on an element, Component.onDestruction gets called.  When I added to the main Page of a test app,\nStateSaver.properties: \"title\"\nStateSaver.enabled: false\n\nmy destruction handlers started getting called, at least on normal exits.  You may be able to combine this with the StateSaver to ensure state gets saved on both normal and abnormal exits.  I don't know that you can count of this behavior, though.  I suspect it may be an accident of the StateSaver implementation.\nAnother approach would be to save state every time something changes.  This ensures you don't have to do anything on exit; your state is already safe.  One problem with this approach is that state changes are often associated with changes in the app itself, and the saving process could induce sluggishness.  I ran into this sort of problem, so I delayed the database write by one second.  This is imperfect, since I would lose state if the program crashes during that second.  But I felt that the risk was small enough, and the change in state inconsequential enough, to make this acceptable.\n", "Q: How to automatically eject drivers disk when mounting Android phone?

I have a Ncell (Nepali cellphone company) SIM card that I want to use in the built-in 3G modem (\"Gobi 2000\" hardware) in my Ubuntu-based notebook.\nThe card uses Ncell's \"normal\" tariff, not Ncell Connect. Accordingly, I cannot book the cheap, never expiring Ncell Connect data packages, but want to use Daily Internet Packs, which seems to be the next cheapest and most flexible option.\nQuestion: How to use any of the options to book these packs successfully under Ubuntu, with the SIM in the notebook? (e.g. the USSD menu option, or Ncell Ecare, which requires SMS confirmation)\nIdeally, the solution should be automated as much as possible, and also prevent me from running into the more expensive data rates when the Daily Internet Pack's volume is exhausted.\n\nA: After much experimenting, the following is my best solution so far.\nSolution: Use atinout to book via USSD menu\nUSSD is used by mobile network operators for responsive service menus – see Wikipedia on USSD. Booking via Ncell's *17123# USSD menu via the computer that has the SIM is the most comfortable option.\nSince dedicated USSD client software did not work for me (see below), I use raw AT commands. For that, I will first install atinout, a small command line utility for using AT commands:\nsudo apt-get install ruby-ronn;\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/atinout/code atinout;\ncd atinout;\nmake;\ncheckinstall make install;\n\nThen, I can use it with AT USSD commands to, for example, book a Daily Internet Pack 40 MB. Here's a full transcript. After the modem confirms your command with OK, wait a few seconds and press Enter to display the USSD answer (which should have arrived by then). Then press Ctrl+C to terminate atinout (^C in the transcript), and restart it again.\n$ sudo stop modemmanager\nstop: Unknown instance:\n\n$ atinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 -\nAT+CUSD=1,\"*17123#\",15\nOK\n+CUSD: 1,\"1.) 1 day Pack \n3.) Facebook Pack \n4.) 7 Day Pack  \n6.)  30 Day Pack \n8.) Unlimited Pack  \nNote: \nBack:* Top:#\",15\n^C\n\n$ atinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 -\nAT+CUSD=1,\"1\",15\nOK\n+CUSD: 1,\"1.Light 6 MB Rs 6 \n2.Light 12 MB Rs 9 \n3.Medium 18 MB Rs 12 \n4.Heavy 40 MB Rs 20 \n5.Deactivate \nNote: \nBack:* Top:#\",15\n^C\n\n$ atinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 -\nAT+CUSD=1,\"4\",15\nOK\n+CUSD: 1,\"1.One time Activations \n2.Auto Renewal Activations \nNote: \nBack:* Top:#\",15\n^C\n\n$ atinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 -\nAT+CUSD=1,\"1\",15\nOK\n+CUSD: 0,\"Dear Customer, your 40 MB pack with 24 hours validity \nis currently processing and will be activated within 10 min. \",15\n^C\n\nYou can combine the above into one script (assuming for now you don't have to retry any command; the AT is just to display the USSD answer):\nsudo stop modemmanager && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT+CUSD=1,\\\"*17123#\\\",15\") && sleep 4 && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT\") && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT+CUSD=1,\\\"1\\\",15\") && sleep 4 && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT\") && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT+CUSD=1,\\\"4\\\",15\") && sleep 4 && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT\") && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT+CUSD=1,\\\"1\\\",15\") && sleep 4 && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT\");\n\n(Note, this script uses a technique to avoid pipe characters.)\nTroubleshooting\nMultiple AT+CUSD commands in a row. For some reason, with my 3G modem (Gobi 2000), in 90% of cases, only one AT+CUSD can be executed successfully, then atinout has to be restarted. To prevent difficulties, in the process above we restart atinout simply every time in the transcript above. This does not end the USSD session (an \"open\" USSD menu).\nIf the modem does not answer with OK. When going along the above transcript, take care that every command is confirmed with \"OK\" by the modem. If not, restart atinout and try again. If that does not help, start the whole process again. And if that does not help, your modem might be in a strange state. Reset it, or just let the computer go through a suspend / resume cycle.\nUsing AT commands in general. For more details about communicating with a modem using AT commands under Linux, see this answer.\nWhen booking a Daily Internet Pack fails. The Ncell Ecare website would fail without an error message and show the list of services again, instead of a success message of a form to enter a SMS confirmation code. This condition happens if you still have an active monthly (or also weekly?) Internet pack. Even if no data balance is left of it. You can check that and if necessary cancel the pack here. However for me, even after cancelling the pack, a data balance query by SMS would return \"Dear Customer, You have […] MB data left in your Monthly account which will expire […].\" and it was still impossible to book a Daily Internet Pack. I would have to wait until the expiration date. Maybe try putting the SIM into a phone and book the first Daily Internet Pack via USSD code (dial *17123# and follow the on-screen menu.)\nFuture Improvements\nAutomation. With the above solution, we have to navigate the menu manually, and try again if something goes wrong. Could be better.\nAutomatic re-booking. Ideally, this solution would include automatic (re-)booking when the data balance runs low. This can be detected by the Ncell warning SMS and / or traffic monitoring. This would not book a new pack automatically when it expires naturally, but then notify the user with a status icon that she's browsing with the expensive rate.\nBe notified when the data balance runs out. If so, we would not require transferring limited amounts to the SIM card, but could transfer a large amount and would be warned (for example by a big red icon in the task bar) when running into the expensive rate. There are at least two ways for this:\nGetting the Ncell notification SMS during an active data connection. Ncell sends it when the data balance runs low. See the point above on wvdial etc. how this could work. It does not work with NetworkManager and gammu out of the box, since it grabs both modem control channels.\nLimiting data traffic. NTM would be a candidate tool for this, but it currently does not have a feature to set one-time pack data limits with exact start time.\nAlternative USSD client software (not working for me)\nThere are dedicated USSD clients under Ubuntu Linux, but they did not work for me for various reasons (my 3G modem hardware: Gobi 2000). However, with some debugging, you might get them to work. The usage of some is treated in more detail in this question and this question.\nThe list, with the most promising candidates first:\n\n\n*\n\n*mmcli. ModemManager and its command line client mmcli seem to be great software and the best bet for this task. See this answer on StackOverflow for how to use mmcli to navigate USSD menus. However, after solving a problem with always-on PIN2 lock on Ncell SIM cards (solution similar to this), mmcli would still refuse sending USSD commands via the Gobi 2000 3G modem, due to a bug (because the modem uses USSD with other clients software successfully):\n$ sudo apt-get install libqmi-utils\n$ sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --dms-uim-verify-pin=PIN2,0000\n$ sudo qmicli -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --dms-uim-get-pin-status\n$ mmcli -m 0 -e  # Index as found via mmcli -L\n$ mmcli -m 0 --3gpp-ussd-initiate=\"*100#\"\nerror: Modem has nn USSD capabilities.\n\n\n*gsm-ussd. gsm-ussd is a command line utility exclusively for sending USSD codes, and it can operate USSD menus (see how in this answer). For Ncell though, I was able to send USSD codes and get answers, but not to operate USSD menus. There would be various inconsistent error messages, and I did not investigate if the problem is my hardware, gsm-ussd or Ncell's implementation of USSD.\n\n*gammu. gammu is a Linux command line utility that can send USSD codes, but according to this question, it cannot use USSD menus yet. python-gammu contains a script service_numbers.py that is meant to enable this. It did not work for me though.\n\n*ofono. ofono has a similar purpose and interface as ModemManager [source], just that it is made for Ubuntu Touch (which can run on mobile phones). Its main interface is DBus, but you can use its test case command line tools to send USSD commands and operate USSD menus (examples, more examples). However, it seems to need a rild (Radio Interface Layer Daemon) implementation to function, and that would only be available on actual mobile phones. When starting, ofonod would complain about not being able to connect to rild, and I could not find a rild to install on a normal Ubuntu Linux installation.\n\n*ussdq. ussdq is another small utility for Linux that includes a feature to operate USSD menus. However, it no longer in active development sincee 2013, and compiling it is a bit of an effort (it uses the Gambas2 framework, but recent Ubuntu Linux versions only include packages for Gambas3).\n\nA: See also my other answer, which I think is the better one.\nSolution: Book via Ncell Ecare website\nBooking via USSD commands is the most comfortable solution (see my other answer). But if it does not work for you for some reason, here is another, less comfortable but working alternative.\n\n\n*\n\n*Transfer 25 NPR to the computer's SIM card. As many times as you want to buy Daily Internet Packs at the same time. The fastest and most comfortable way for this is to dial a corresponding USSD code *17122*<980… mobile number>*25# [source] from your address book. The price includes the 1.25 NPR charge for the transfer, and taxes added when booking the 40MB Daily Internet Pack for 20 NPR.\n\n*Create a wifi hotspot with the phone. And connect the computer to it, or use an existing wifi connection if available.\n\n*Book one-time \"40 MB Heavy\" Daily Internet Packs on Ncell Ecare. You can book multiple ones in a row, and the data volume will aggregate. You will have to confirm the first booking with a confirmation code received by SMS. Obtain that SMS for example as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute gammu deletesms 0 1 (assuming you don't need the SMS stored in slot 1) to make space for the incoming SMS. It will be received in the first free space (guaranteed 1 here), but would not be received if all 20-30 storage spaces on the SIM card are used up.\n\n*Click \"Send SMS\" in the Ncell Ecare website's book process.\n\n*Execute gammu getsms 0 1 to obtain the confirmation SMS.\n\n*Enter the confirmation code on the Ncell Ecare website.\n\n\n*Use Internet via mobile data until it stops working.\n\n*Confirm that the balance has run out with a balance check. In short:\ngammu deletesms 0 1 && \\\ngammu sendsms TEXT 9909 -text \"status\" && \\\nsleep 10 && \\\ngammu getsms 0 1\n\nDisconnect your mobile broadband connection if it does not work otherwise (some connection managers grab both modem control channels, leaving none for gammu).\n\n*Repeat.\nTroubleshooting\nSimplifying login to Ncell Ecare. Using the Ncell Ecare website frequently is uncomfortable because it prevents the login data from being saved by the browser, prevents copy&paste to be used for pasting into the password field, and additionally, has a captcha on the login form. Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*If using Firefox, install the Autofill Forms addon.\n\n*Then visit the Ncell login page, right-click into a field and choose \"Add complete form as profile …\".\n\n*In the profile creation dialogue, modify the site rule matching to be (?:ecare\\.ncell\\.com\\.np:9443), and enter your values for username and password.\n\n*Copy that profile and adapt it for other SIM cards you have.\n\n*From now on, to log in, right-click anywhere on the login page except into a form field, and choose \"Autofill Forms → \".\n\n*(Optional) To allow pasting into the password field, install the FoxReplace Firefox addon and set up a rule for URL https://ecare.ncell.com.np:9443/nser/index.do?method=init with the \"HTML for input and output\" option set and the action to replace the text onkeydown=\"keyDownForbidCopyPaste(passwordIn) with nothing.\n\n*(Optional) If you really want to To get rid of the captcha solving, solve the captcha problem, you can use the Rumola browser addon. However note that a captcha solving will cost 0.013 USD with them, since it involves (at least sometimes) human processing. Their auto-search for captchas does not work for the Ncell Ecare login form. Instead, right-click into the captcha text field and choose \"Use this field to enter Captcha\". Then double-click into the field to let Rumola solve the captcha. While that is in process, use the \"Autoform fill\" step from above to fill in the remaining login info.\nSolution when the Ncell Ecare website shows a WSOD. WSOD = white screen of death. You would see just a white content area in your browser when visiting the website. This is a bug in their web application that is triggered when experiencing an Internet connection failure while logged into Ncell Ecare. To fix this condition, there are at least the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete cache and cookies stored for the Ncell Ecare login, go to the login page again, and log in again.\n\n*Switch to a different Multifox profile (for Firefox) or MultiLogin profile (for Chrome), and reload the page.\nAlso see my other answer.\nPossible future improvements\nUsing the mobile broadband connection to book the package. This will work once I find out how to receive the confirmation code SMS (for booking the data package in the Ncell Ecare website) while the data connection is active. Does not work with Linux NetworkManager and gammu out of the box, because network-manager will grab both modem control channels, leaving none for gammu. The alternative of disconnecting, getting the SMS with gammu and then reconnecting does not work either because Ncell forces a logout then, and this invalidates the SMS confirmation code as well. Somebody reported that using wvdial instead of NetworkManager to connect fixed this [source].\nGet SMS automatically, in notifications. Like the steps above, it requires a way to work with SMS during an active data connection. It would show the confirmation SMS when booking an Internet Pack via the Ncell Ecare website, and move it to the hard disk to keep the SIM card storage spaces free for recceiving new SMSs. This would speed up the process compared to the current proposal with a manual command to get the confirmation SMS off the SIM card.\nBooking via Ncell Ecare without SMS confirmation. Would simplify the process a lot, as one can use the computer's mobile broadband connection to book the Internet pack. Needs Ncell action.\nBooking via Ncell Ecare website without forced logout. Would simplify the process a lot just like not needing SMS confirmation, as one can use the computer's mobile broadband connection, switch it off to get the SMS, then switch it on again to enter the confirmation code into Ncell Ecare. Currently this will force a logout, which invalidates the confirmation code as well.\nBooking via Ncell app that allows managing external SIM cards. In this case, the Ncell app would allow managing multiple SIM cards without needing the other SIM cards physically in the phone. In principle like the Ncell Ecare website. Again, needs action by Ncell.\nAlso see my other answer.\nNon-working alternatives\nBooking with the Ncell Ecare website in a smartphone browser. Tried this, but could not log into that website with the smartphone for some reason. The login button would just do nothing. Also, since that website is not mobile friendly, booking on the computer via a wifi hotspot connection seems more comfortable anyway.\nInstalling the Ncell app twice. There are ways how to download and modify any Android so you can install it twice (I used this solution for the Ncell app). I hoped it would allow me to log in with two different accounts, managing my phone's and computer's SIM card in parallel. However, login in the Ncell app depends on SIM card detection, you cannot use it to manage a non-present SIM card.\nBooking via Ncell app in a simulator. You can run Android and the Ncell app in a virtual machine like OpenBox, but it will be hard to fake the SIM card detection to it.\n", "Q: How to get the details of User(Computer)name and the Password?

Sometimes it’s annoying to access a directory with the folder name. Say I have a directory named a b c d. Apart from using Tab, is there any way to access the folder without typing the name of the directory?\nI know that Linux has a unique identifier every particular file. Can I use this to access the folder? I don’t know whether this can be actually done or how to do it.\nI that think when Linux implements a filesystem, it compares two directory names’ uniqueness. So each directory must be unique in a space. But I think that it’s like a primary key in a database system. Is the primary key the name of the directory or is there some other unique identifier (perhaps some numbers stored “under the hood”)?\nTry to think of this like a process. If you execute the command ps on a terminal, it outputs a process list with the name and number of each process. You have to call that process with the process number. Similarly, is there a number for a directory so that you could call the directory with its number instead of calling it with its name?\n\nOn further investigation, I have found that each directory has a unique inode. However, I have not so far found any built-in command to access a directory by its inode.\n\nA: You can make Tab rotate the available folders instead of listing them.\nEdit the file ~/.inputrc and add\n\"\\C-i\": menu-complete\n\"\\e[Z\": \"\\e-1\\C-i\"\n\nIf you want it for all users, edit /etc/inputrc instead.\nPress Ctrl + x and Ctrl + r to make it effective.\nNow use cdTab to navigate to your folder without writing its name. cdShift + Tab will rotate in the other direction.\nWorth remembering that cd - will take you to the last visited folder.\n\nA: You can use shell wildcards.\nFor instance, I can do\ncd a?b?c?d\n\nor\ncd a\\*b\\*c\\*d\n\nAnd it will expand the wildcards to the actual name and change to that directory. Assuming that's the only directory which matches.\nIf you have both a b c d and a1b2c3d, then cd a?b?c?d will expand to either cd a1b2c3d a b c d or cd a b c d a1b2c3d (the actual order will depend on the kernel, filesystem...), and bash will silently move you to the first path.\nOn the other hand, you often not have so similarly named folders, so something like a*d is enough to expand that without having to type all the intermediate characters. This is specially useful when you are not actually able to type it (eg. the names are in a different script, or even a different encoding), and you would otherwise have needed to octal-encode the filename.\n\nA: You can find this directory in a file manager, e.g. nautilus and just drag and drop it to terminal.\nIf you previously type cd in terminal, you will get the command.\n\nA: Solution made by OP\nNo built-in command found here . But finally I am able to write a C program to use cd(lets call my program icd == (inode cd) ) to enter in a folder using inode value. Here I am posting the raw code. \nBut there is a fundamental problem I have faced here. While coding execution a C code from a bash needed to create child process under the bash process(parent process). From the child process the directory space is new, and I can not access parent process's directory space from there. So nothing could be done except invoked a new bash window from here. In future I will try to implement a new tab feature if people are interested in this. But I believe I have faced a lot of criticism for doing this. So people might not be interested. I have just done for my amusement.\nRAW code is shared here, \n#include<stdio.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include<dirent.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <grp.h>\n#include<pwd.h>\n\nusing namespace std ;\n\nint main(int argc , char *argv[] ) {\n\n  struct stat ITR ;\n\n  if( argc != 2 ) {\n    printf(\"\\nWrong Command\\n\\n\") ;\n    return 1 ;\n  }\n\n  long long given_inode = 0 ;\n  for( int i =0 ; argv[1][i] ; i++ ){\n    given_inode *= 10 ;\n    given_inode += (argv[1][i]-'0') ;\n  }\n\n//  if (stat(argv[1], &ITR) == -1) {\n//    perror(\"stat\");\n//    return 1  ;\n//  }\n\n  printf(\"%s\\n\",argv[0]) ;\n    char PWD[1000] ; \n    getcwd( PWD , 1000 ) ;\n\n  DIR *d;\n  struct dirent *p;\n  char path[100000] ;\n  d = opendir(\".\");\n  if( d != NULL ) {\n    while( (p = readdir(d))!= NULL ) {\n        strcpy( path , \"./\" ) ;\n        strcat( path, p->d_name ) ;\n        stat(path, &ITR) ;\n        //printf(\"%s --> \",path) ;\n        //printf(\"%ld\\n\",ITR.st_ino) ;\n        if( ITR.st_ino == given_inode ) {\n          strcpy( path , \"gnome-terminal --working-directory=\" ) ;\n          strcat( path, PWD ) ;\n                    strcat( path, \"/\" ) ;\n                    strcat( path, p->d_name ) ;\n                    system(path) ; \n                    //printf(\"%s\\n\",path) ;\n                    return 0 ;\n        }\n    }\n  }\n  printf(\"icd %lld:No such file or directory\\n\",given_inode) ;\n  return 0 ;\n\n}\n\nI am using gnome terminal here. Obviously For other distro the code will be changed.\n\nA: Any entity in (most) file systems on Linux has an unique identifier called an inode. Notice that a file can have more than one name (hardlink), but directories have just one link in all the filesystems I know of. Notice that the concept of inode is local to the filesystem, so that in two different devices (partition or whatever) the uniqueness is not guaranteed. \nYou can see the inode of your directory with ls -ldi:\n[:~] % ls -ldi tmp/uffa                     \n20873234 drwxrwxr-x 2 romano romano 4096 Jun 26  2014 tmp/uffa\n\nSo you know that your directory has inode 20873234. Now you can switch to it with the command:\n[:~] % cd \"$(find ~ -inum 20873234 2> /dev/null)\"  \n[:~/tmp/uffa] %\n\n(Note that the 2> /dev/null is to shut up error messages about unreadable directories along the path.)\nThis command will scan the entirety of your home directory, so be patient.1\nBut what about using cd and the TAB-completion of your shell?\n\n1. This must be the most2 inefficient thing I ever posted ... an ode to entropy. The reason is that the “primary key” under which the access to a file or directory is optimized, fast and direct is — guess what? — the pathname: /dir/dir/file_or_dir. Moreover, to grant you access to a given directory, the system needs to check all the permissions in the path... so again, accessing by inode means scanning recursively the filesystem. \n2. Well, you can make thing worse by scanning from /.3\n3. But then it won't work, because inodes are unique only on a per-filesystem (per-mount) basis.\n\nA: Not sure if that's exactly what your asking for, but zsh has some neat tricks to access a directory by other means than typing the directory's strict name; for one, you can type a part of the name and it will expand to the directory's full name, which allows for very useful things, for example:\n\nHitting TAB...\n\n\nA: The simplest way is to double click on the directory name (assuming it is visible on the screen), then type cd followed by space and click the wheel button on your mouse and it will copy and paste the directory name that you have highlighted. Pressing the enter key will then change to the directory required.\nI use this procedure all the time and it's not just confined to directory names. It can be used for any commands using the command line.\nGood luck.\n\nA: If it is just one or a few directories, why not have aliases in your bashrc or whatever init files? For example:\nalias abc='cd /tmp/\"a b c\"'\n\nThen whenever you want to go in there, just type abc \n\nA: You could write a program to create a hash table for all of your OS directories. It would basically be a tree flattening program.\nBut then you could do something like hash-cd 32okjv02 and it would do the hash table lookup for the 32okjv02 to directory mapping. and jump to your directory. And it would be really fast once you got all your directories indexed.\nYou would have to alias mkdir to call this program every new directory and maybe write a hash-table check/refresh command you could cron every minute and on logon.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't detect my second monitor I'm on a new install of Ubuntu 14.04 and I have nvidia drivers.\nWhen I go to Settings > Display I can only see one monitor. \nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: I found the solution : I just used an adapter VGA to DVI between my second monitor and my computer and it's ok now.\n", "Q: \"mplayer -vo caca fma.avi\" lags, how can i skip frames so it doesn't lag \"mplayer -vo caca\" looks funny and enjoyably fun to watch in breaks, especially as a screen saver!\nUnfortunately it lags, and (since video/asci is synced to sound,) sound is fragmented ( \"s\", pause, \"o\", pause, pause, \"u\", \"n\", pause, \"d\").\nWhat command can i add to \nmplayer -vo caca fma.avi\n\nso that it plays in real time, I don't care (and am hoping actually) if frames are skipped, I just want to see funny frames of some funny avis (of course ideally i would just like to watch an episode without frame skips or lags between frames, and my card is not actually low end, especially for asci decoding, but it is an experimental feature, so cant actually complain)\nHow to edit the above command so movie is viewed(and heard) at 1x speed?\n\nA: The MPlayer docs will usually suggest some combination of the following:\nTry some of the lavdopts,\n    e.g. -vfm ffmpeg -lavdopts lowres=1:fast:skiploopfilter=all.\n- Broken file\n  - Try various combinations of -nobps -ni -forceidx -mc 0.\n- Slow media (NFS/SMB mounts, DVD, VCD etc)\n  - Try -cache 8192.\n- Are you using -cache to play a non-interleaved AVI file?\n  - Try -nocache.\n\nAnd perhaps this will be enough for you?

Nevertheless, I think everyone should be aware of this so we can hopefully find a solution for it. Here we go!\nI had Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot just fine and was able to access my Windows partition (for music, pictures, etc) without any problems. However, upon doing the free upgrade to Windows 10, I had to re-install Linux on the remaining partition (no big deal). But now, the following happens. I can only access the Windows 10 partition if I first boot up Windows 10 and then \"Restart\" into Linux. Even if I shut down Ubuntu and go back into it, I'll still have access to the partition because the last function I performed in Windows 10 was \"Restart.\" If I go back into Windows 10 and click \"Shut Down\" and then power back up into Linux, that's when I get the mounting error stating \"Unable to access 'Windows 10'\"\nIf you guys have any insight on how to fix this issue or if you believe that Ubuntu has to release an update to correct the problem, please respond either way! Thanks! :)\n\nA: Well I found the answer to problem. It had to do with the power configuration in Windows 10. It's actually an issue that goes back to Windows 8 but I didn't know about it because I didn't have 8. I went from 7 to 10. Anyway, had to open up a command prompt, run as administrator and enter the following:\npowercfg /h off\n\nThis disables all hibernate options, including that \"fast startup\" feature that is present in 8 and 10. The fast startup was being read by Ubuntu as a form of \"hibernate,\" hence the mounting error.\n", "Q: Not enough free space to update I’m very new to Linux and can’t really use the command line well. I’m simply trying to install the latest updates. When I do, I get a ‘not enough free space’ message.\nI can see in my System Monitor that my boot drive is pretty much full, but the internal 1 terabyte HDD has barely been touched. Is my boot drive a different storage unit in my computer I don’t know about (perhaps something that comes default on the motherboard)?\nIs there a way to change my boot drive smoothly to the terabyte HDD? That is, can I easily transfer the OS files to that drive? In fact, what is the boot drive? Is it simply whatever drive I have the Linux OS on?\n\nI’ve done some looking around on forums and see that people clear out old kernels. I don’t quite understand what this means. Are they simply deleting the old updates, because the newer ones have essentially more efficient and better programming/capabilities?\nIs there a way to do this without using the command line?\nWhat is the best solution?\n\nA: You've asked a few specific questions so I will go ahead and answer those.\n\nwhat is the boot drive? Is it simply whatever drive I have the Linux OS on?\n\n/boot is the place everything your computer needs to boot is stored, including the kernel and grub. Ubuntu doesn't remove old kernels by default so they can pile up and eventually take up all the space on /boot. \n\nI can see in my System Monitor that my boot drive is pretty much full, but the internal 1 terabyte HDD has barely been touched. Is my boot drive a different storage unit in my computer I don’t know about (perhaps something that comes default on the motherboard)?\n\nOn a basic install if boot is full your hard drive should be too, so without more information about how you setup your Ubuntu install I can't say why boot is full but your hard drive isn't. It is possible you setup /boot to be on a different partition or another HDD altogether, in which case you would see this behaviour.  \n\nI’ve done some looking around on forums and see that people clear out old kernels. I don’t quite understand what this means. Are they simply deleting the old updates, because the newer ones have essentially more efficient and better programming/capabilities?\n\nPretty much, yes. Periodically the kernel will be updated to a new version. When this happens Ubuntu doesn't remove the old version(s) because sometimes a newer kernel can cause stability issues with some hardware so they leave the older versions to fall back to just in case (this has only happened to me once in ~5 years). \nRemoving the old kernels is definitely the best solution. The best way to do this would be to periodically run the command:  \nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nwhich will remove old obsolete packages that are no longer needed (including old kernels). See this question for other ways to remove old kernels: How do I free up more space in /boot? \n\nIs there a way to do this without using the command line?\n\nAbsolutely. Check out this answer, using the synaptic package manager, as well as this answer, using Ubuntu Tweak.

I know this Question is not technically related to Ubunutu but let me explain my problem. I am planning to but a Wi-Fi modem+router recently. I was learning to access the setting and tried on my currently wired modem. Now I used 192.168.1.1 and it showed error. then i tried typing ipconfig in cmd (I was on windows at that time). Didn't got the valid IP config and then changed the setting on IP4 in network connections still it didn't work. Hence, my question. \n\nA: Note : This is a general answer to give you the basic idea behind the stuffs as your question does not seem properly directed (IMHO).\nIf you are on the network 192.168.1.0/24 then you can access any service on any computer within your subnet provided you have sufficient privilege to do so or not blocked by any firewall. \nTypically 192.168.1.1 would be the gateway address of the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet as it is the first usable IP of the subnet. Now you are sending a request using http protocol to that IP address by doing http://192.168.1.1, if that host is not listening for any http connection then you will simply not get the required service. This is true if 192.168.1.1 is running Ubuntu or a wireless router or anything else you can imagine.\nSo to answer your question you need a service that is listening on port 80 (http) on 192.168.1.1 to access http://192.168.1.1 .\n", "Q: Canon LBP6000 printer not working with Ubuntu 14.04 I am running Ubuntu 14.04.

Does it always mean the same thing ?\n\nA: C-x h means hold the Control key pressed while you hit (press and release) the x key, and then hit the h key.\nEmacs key notation does not use C-x-h; it is a mistake.  (But C-H-x is not a mistake, because H- is the Hyper modifier key - see below.)\nThe hyphen (-) is used after a key when the key is a modifier key. A modifier key is held down while the next key is hit. C- is the Control modifier key.  M- is the Meta modifier key (typically a keyboard Alt key). S is the Shift modifier key.  Those are the standard modifier keys.  Some keyboards have additional modifier keys, such as Hyper (H-) and Super (s-).\nYou can find such information by asking Emacs: C-h r to access the manual, then i to ask the index of the manual: type something and hit TAB to see what matching index entries there are. In this case: C-h r i key TAB shows you that key itself is an index entry - so hit RET (Enter key) to see information about keys, in particular, the answer to your question.\n(Well, actually this node of the manual tells you the answer to your question.  You could find it using i key TAB as the entry keyboard input.)\n", "Q: WIFI keep asking password This question has been asked in various threads and I tried all options, but I am still getting the problem: wifi network is keep asking the password.

I get the ads without issue, but the video stream just shows a black screen. I have tried the Pipelight solution for Firefox, but it is horrible. Nothing syncs, and it ends up freezing after 3 or 4 minutes, which requires FF to be restarted. Not good when trying to watch anything.\nIn Windows, both TSN and Sportsnet stream live flawlessly.\nIf there is some kind of DRM garbage required that Windows has natively, is there a way (other than Pipelight) to get either Chrome or Chromium to work for these live streams?\nThanks.\nPS. Chrome in my Ubuntu install runs everything else without issue. It is only these two that show black screens.\n\nA: Same issue here. Yes, it's DRM garbage. Pipelight is likely your only hope for native-like playback, otherwise a virtual machine just for your streaming sports.\n", "Q: Using rsync to back up a remote computer through a reverse ssh link I can rsync to my remote computer, but cannot rsync from my remote computer - it doesn't seem to exchange a file list in that direction, so it tries to transfer all of a huge number of files rather than update just the ones that have changed are that are new.\nThe setup is a bit complicated. I have a remote computer behind a firewall and need to exchange files with that computer from my home computer.  The home computer doesn't have a permanent IP address, so I'm using noip to bounce the reverse ssh to whatever my home computer's current IP address is. The reverse ssh command my remote computer is running is:\nautossh -g -R 45678:localhost:22 me@noip.net\n\nOn my home computer, I'm running the noip2 program that tells noip.net to bounce port 45678 to my home computer.\nOn my home computer, I can synchronize my documents folder to my remote computer using:\nrsync -navzu --stats -e \"ssh -p 45678\" --delete /home/me/Documents/ me@localhost:/home/me/Documents\n\nThat works fine. Only documents that are new or have been updated are transferred and the remote computer is made up-to-date.  \nHowever, when I try to reverse this to update home home computer from the remote computer with the following, it doesn't work:\nrsync -navzu --stats -e \"ssh -p 45678\" --delete me@localhost:/home/me/Documents/ /home/me/Documents\n\nrsync sees none of the files in Documents on my home computer and tries to transfer every file, on a dry run.\nAny idea what's wrong here?\n\nA: Well, looks like I found an answer to my question, though the problem isn't what I thought it was.\nI had a chance to take a closer look at what files rsync was trying to transfer.  Turns out it wasn't every file, but the vast majority.  Apparently, when the remote filesystem was created, a switch wasn't used to insure that the date-time stamp was preserved.  As a result, all the files were copied over with a date-time stamp of the date on which the files were created on the remote system.  Only files that have been updated since then had different time-stamps.  So, when rsync tries to update the local system from the remote one, it tries to copy almost all files because they have a newer timestamp on the remote system than on the local system.\nSo, the solution for fixing this is to use touch to put the correct timestamps on the remote system.  I'm not very familiar with the linux shell, so there's probably a much more elegant solution, but here's what worked for me:\n#1: Mount remote file system locally:\nsshfs -p 45678 me@localhost:/ ./mntpt/\n\n#2: Put the following shell script on the remote file system and run it:\n#!/bin/bash\nfind * -newermt \"2014-04-22\" ! -newermt \"2014-04-23\" | while read f; \ndo\n touch \"$f\" -c -m -r \"/home/me/Documents/$f\"\ndone\n\nThe above still takes a long time to run, but almost certainly not as long as trying to back up all the files through a fairly slow connection.  I tried various one-line shell command solutions instead of a script, but found no way to reference the file list twice in the touch command.\n", "Q: Install lemonbar from source I'm having difficulty installing lemonbar package.\nOnce I've extracted the archive, how do I compile?

I want to do a dual boot of Windows XP and Ubuntu 14.04 on a very old Acer Aspire 3690 laptop. Are there any peculiarities of installing Ubuntu with dual boot on Acer Aspire laptops? \nTo be specific, I don't want to mess partition that contains recovery copy of Windows XP. Laptop HDD is divided into 2 partitions, one for OS, another for data. I've already formatted and cleared the data partition and want to install Ubuntu there. Is it safe to do, will Ubuntu install not mess with the rest of the hard drive? On laptop it says that it was designed for Windows XP, it worries me too.\nI also want to install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu. I'm aware that on such laptop it's generally useless, I just need to develop applications for my 64 bit Ubuntu desktop. But I don't know if hardware can support this. This are hardware parameters:\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 420 1.60 GHz\nChipset: Intel 940GML Express\nVideo: Intel GMA 950\nRAM: 512 mb \nAlso I guess I need to install a \"lighter\" version of OS on such laptop. What would be the best solution in such case? Lubuntu? \n\nA: We have an Acer Aspire 5253 which runs Lubuntu very well but its stats are quite a bit better than those, especially the RAM.  I am pretty sure stock Ubuntu 14.04 won't work well at all with 512 meg.  \nAlso I don't think you can use 64 bit Ubuntu because that is a 32 bit processor according to this Intel site.\nMy 2 cents worth is to try running 32 bit Lubuntu from a live CD or USB and see if it works OK, before you do anything irreversible.\n\nA: Once you've picked your OS (I think Lubuntu would be your best bet as well) it should be pretty straightforward from there.  create a bootable drive (you need to determine if your computer can boot from USB or CD/DVD).  You also may need to access your BIOS settings, which you usually get to from hitting F11/F10/F12 repeatedly at startup.  from here, make sure that you can boot from your drive (it helps to have your drive inserted before accessing this so that it populates the boot menu directory).  and restart the computer.  once the live OS starts up, just follow the prompts.  it should detect your existing OS, and you instruct it to install (L)ubuntu alongside it.  following this, just point it to the proper partition to install onto.  you may or may not want to set up a paging partition, but you can do this during the install out of the partition you already have set aside for it.  \n\nA: Thanks for the answers!\nI've installed Lubuntu alongside Windows XP and now have a dual boot system on this Acer Aspire laptop. I didn't even need to point which partition to install to, it immediately suggested the data partition which I've prepared for installation before. Windows OS partition and hidden recovery partition were left untouched.\nPerformance seems to be acceptable. I haven't worked with it much to say for sure, but it definitely boots faster than Windows XP and Firefox seems to show better performance than on XP system.\n", "Q: Touch functionalities on ubuntu 15.10 desktop? I have a 2-in-1 laptop (Lenovo yoga 3 pro) that came pre-installed with windows 8.1.  I removed windows completely to help me adjust faster to ubuntu (successfully, and am happy with the new os).  However, there are a few things that I can't quite figure out yet, mostly having to do with the 2-in-1-ness of my computer...\n\n\n*\n\n*auto-rotate.  windows had this capability, and now I feel spoiled.  if I switch to tablet mode, I generally would hold it vertically (upright).  I know if I go into the settings somewhere, or type a command in the terminal, the screen will rotate.  however, I don't want to have to do this every time I switch the orientation I am using the computer with.  is there any way I can make this occur automatically?  \n\n*on-screen keyboard.  I really like the on-screen keyboard that comes with ubuntu, its stretchable and doesn't look strange on my smaller high-res screen.  however, I still have to go into a settings menu to toggle it on or off.  is there any way to make it pop up when I click in a textbox, or am prompted for text, and then disappear when I select outside of the textbox?\n\n*anything else I may be forgetting that is handy with a laptop/tablet?  I don't use the testing builds, but is there anything in the works for 2-in-1's (I've noticed there being a lot more out now) to make ubuntu more adaptive?  This is just my two cents, but I think ubuntu needs to get ahead of the curve on this fast...one of the benefits of linux OS's in general is that they can update rapidly and come with a huge array of capabilities, but I feel kind of stuck here with my 2-in-1.  \n\n*as a final option, how dumbed-down is the ubuntu touch OS?  is this my issue?  I am unfamiliar with it, does it have all the same capabilities as the desktop variant?  \nUpdate:\nfor the keyboard, I have found out a little more about onboard, but I'm not sure it's a permanent solution.  in the dash, type \"onboard\" and click \"onboard settings.\"  from here, ensure \"auto-show when editing text\" is checked, and click settings next to it.  then, I check \"hide when using a physical keyboard\" and adjust \"stay hidden\" to 1 minute.  this is still a subpar solution.  the keyboard does not appear when I am prompted for text everywhere, such as in the chrome address bar.  it does come up when I open up the dash, which is a workaround, but still not ideal.  it should simply appear when necessary, and disappear when it's just in the way.  \n\nA: Answers and remarks:\n(1) I can't make the screen rotate. What is the command?\n(2) Open the dash. Type onscreen. Drag onscreen into left hand Unity application menu, thereby always making the onscreen keyboard but one onscreen button press away.\n(2-hint) in onscreen settings->general click auto-show, not that this always makes the keyboard autoshow but sometimes it does.\n(3) Well said. If(!) Canonical walks its talk then Ubuntu would recognise it was on a Yoga 3 Pro and auto-configure to suit. And it would know about all four physical configs and autorotate the screen as necessary.

You may need to run sudo dhclient eth0 once the interface is up to get an IP address. \nFor wireless interface, after ifup, you'll need Network Manager to configure it to connect to a given AP.\n\nAlso if static IP is needed, then I normally used these commands to setup the interface:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.118\nsudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf # then add a line nameserver 192.168.0.1 in that file\nsudo route add default gw 192.168.0.1\n\nA: You need to read this: https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration\nIt helps out with learning what you need to do for what.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 unknown (external) monitor every time after reboot I connected an external monitor (LG 21 in) with my laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad 15 in).

I've currently got windows 8.1 installed, with no linux at all. If I go into the BIOS settings, ubuntu is still listed under the UEFI boot priorities. For reference, I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7537 laptop. I've reinstalled win 8.1 in GPT UEFI mode, but now I can't install linux whatsoever. Advanced startup in win will absolutely not allow me to boot into a linux or windows USB (yes formatted for GPT UEFI). I've got no idea where to go from here. I can get the system setup again with MBR Legacy, but would really rather sort this problem out if anyone has faced this particular problem before. Please don't suggest that I VM or Wine whatever programs I need as that isn't a viable option.\n\nA: Normally you can get a boot manager menu by pressing Esc, Enter, or a function key as you start the computer. (Which keypress does this varies from one machine to another.) I've heard of cases where this functionality stops working for some reason, though -- it sounds to me like the cause is really a firmware bug. Updating the firmware or resetting it to the default settings may clear the problem, but such updates and resets may also be difficult if you can't get into the firmware setup utility. This page provides instructions on one workaround that involves telling Windows to reboot into the firmware setup utility.\nIf that doesn't work, one possibility is to install my rEFInd boot manager from within Windows. The trouble with this approach is that if your system has Secure Boot set up, you'll need to obtain and install a Shim or PreLoader binary, too, which greatly complicates the setup process. (See the rEFInd Secure Boot documentation for more on this subject.) If you can get rEFInd to start up, it should present you with a menu of boot options, including any bootable external media on your system. If you don't see such options, hit the Esc key; this triggers a re-scan, which often picks up devices that were missed on the initial scan.\n\nA: If I understand correctly you cannot get into boot options and select USB. Have you tried shift restart. Windows do a different type of restart when you hold shift key at selecting restart. It helped me to get into BIOS and boot menu.\nhttp://windowssecrets.com/langalist-plus/with-windows-8-off-isnt-really-off/\n", "Q: How to disable profile name in Google Chrome?

So if you want to create the file containing the default values you would use:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\nWhich prints the default values into a hidden file named .xbindkeysrc located in home (~).\nNow to actually change the bindings of keys we first need to know what the name or keysym of those keys is. xbindkeys allows us to use the -k handle to find the name of a key or key combination. Run:\nxbindkeys -k\n\nAnd press a key or key combination. Your output will look something similar to this (when pressing space):\n\"NoCommand\"\nm:0x10 + c:65\nMod2 + space\n\n\"No Command\" tells us that currently no command is associated with the Space key.\nm:0x10 + c:65\nMod2 + space  \n\nIs the name of the key/key combination.\nthe config file..\nLets open up the config file you made earlier:\ngedit .xbindkeysrc \n\nHere is an excerpt from the default config file:\n#\n# A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in\n# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h\n# The XK_ is not needed.\n#\n# List of modifier:\n#   Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock),\n#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll). \n#\n\n# The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can  \n# use it if you want to catch release events instead of press events\n\n# By defaults, xbindkeys does not pay attention with the modifiers\n# NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock.\n# Uncomment the lines above if you want to pay attention to them.\n\n#keystate_numlock = enable\n#keystate_capslock = enable\n#keystate_scrolllock= enable\n\n# Examples of commands:\n\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nEvery line beginning with # is a comment and won't be read or run by xbindkeys.\nSo far the only line that isn't commented out is:\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nThis excerpt shows the basic syntax of xbindkeys commands:\n\"Command to run (in quotes)\"\nkey to associate with command (no quotes)  \n\nSo as you can see:\n\"xbindkeys_show\" \n control+shift + q  \n\nRuns the command xbindkeys_show when you press Ctrl+Shift+q.\n", "Q: unable to install mongodb from mongodb repos I posted about this before at unable to install mongodb on ubuntu 14.04 but that question didn't have me installing from the mongodb repos.

Is there any Way to Edit/Create a file in the method of File Permission ?\nSuppose it is '7' means can we able to change it to '4' ?\ni.e -rwx to -r ?\nIs there any code or___ to do?\n\nA: I believe you are looking for chmod. This command allows you to change permissions for a file.\nSay you want to change the permissions of ./foo.txt to '4' then it's chmod 4 ./foo.txt \nIf you want to do this to all the files in a directory it would be chmod 4 *.\nIf you wanted to do this recursively through all files and directories somewhere it would be chmod -R 4 *\nIf you wanted to revert the change back to '7' on a file, it would be chmod 7 ./foo.txt. You can also use * or -R this way to change permissions on more than one file.\nClick here for the chmod man pages.\nOccasionally you will need to run sudo chmod instead of just chmod. Originally I had it as sudo chmod everywhere, however it is a bad habit to get into to use sudo when you don't need to.\n", "Q: Cannot turn Bluetooth on on my Ubuntu 14.04 system My hardware has support for Bluetooth, but every time I need to use Bluetooth I have no option but to boot to Windows. I have tried many options, but most of them have failed to provide any solution. The basic problem is that I cannot turn the adapter on at all. This is what I get on the System Settings window: \nAs you can see, the Bluetooth and Visibility switches are frozen. I haven't yet found a way to remedy this. Ideas?\n\nA: I had the same problem. But I follow the answer of Ralink RT 3290 Bluetooth Problem on Ubuntu 14.04 question, and luckly it solved the problem I had. I already modified the files that needed to be modified. You can download the file form http://www.filedropper.com/rtbth-393. All you have to do is go to the directory from terminal and run \nmake\nsudo make install\n\nAnd then reboot your computer. I attached a screen shot. It worked for me, hope it work for you too. Good luck.\n\n\nA: Have you tried reinstall bluetooth, and enter this in the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install blueman\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: EFI/GPT system partion with bootable RAID 1 system installation I've used the ubuntu server installation image to install onto a RAID 1, which is two disks mirrored for redundancy.\nMy configuration is as follows:\n/dev/sda - 500GB\n/dev/sda1 - 1GB, EFI system partition which mounts to /boot/efi\n/dev/sda2 - 499GB, RAID Member  \n/dev/sdb - 500GB\n/dev/sdb1 - 1GB, EFI system partition (not currently mounted)\n/dev/sdb2 - 499GB, RAID Member  \n/dev/md0 - 499GB RAID Array\na little unpartitioned free space\n/dev/md0p2 - 256MB ext2 filesystem which mounts to /boot\n/dev/md0p3 - 498GB Linux LVM2 physical volume  \nand then the LVM2 volume is composed of\n/dev/ubuntu-vg/root - 494GB ext4 filesystem which mounts to /\n/dev/ubuntu-vg/swap_1 - 4GB swap file  \nThis boots fine. I am using a mac mini though. I'm a little confused because when I press the \"alt\" key during bootup, it doesn't show any ubuntu boot devices to choose from, but if I don't press the alt key during bootup, it boots ubuntu. ----- I don't think this is related at all to my problem, but just noteworthy. Probably just something weird with apple's EFI implementation.\nMy concern though is if disk sda fails, what happens? Is anything in /boot/efi ever used anymore after the system is running? If I reboot and only disk sdb is working, will it boot? I don't think so because when I mount /dev/sdb1 to see what is there, it is empty. What happens if part of disk sda goes bad (making partition sda2 junk), but the partition sda1 is still good, will ubuntu boot to the raid member in sdb2? How can I check this?\nI have seen several references suggest I should run\ngrub-install /dev/sdb\n\nto install to the second drive. Some of these references are:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID\nhttp://kudzia.eu/b/2013/04/installation-of-debian-wheezy-on-mdadm-raid1-gpt/\nhttp://elblogdedually.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-to-install-ubuntumint-on-software.html\nHowever, I think most of those are talking about for BIOS/MBR configurations because when I run that command, the partition /dev/sdb1 stays empty and the files in /dev/sda1 are modified (I've looked at the mounted version in /boot/efi).\nI've seen another reference (How to install Ubuntu server with UEFI and RAID1 + LVM) that says I should run\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1\n\nwhich seems like it should work, although it's hard for me to unmount /dev/sda1 to do that (do I have to?), and as I mentioned above, I don't how the RAID is referenced, so I don't know what is going to happen if one of the members had failed.\nAnd then the other question I have is, once I figure out the right way to duplicate the EFI system partition on both disks, how often do I need to update it? It really seems like I should not have to worry about this at all, but I think I do. Apple's RAID system does allow disk to boot without worrying about this kind of thing...why can't ubuntu's be that easy?\n\nA: Re copying the partition, you should be able to boot into a Ubuntu Live CD/USB and clone it from there. Furthermore, you need to insert the ESP into the boot chain. For details, I wrote a detailed instruction here.\n", "Q: Evolution Calender event not showing in panel date menu I have entered an event in Evolution but it is not showing in panel's date menu.

But on an older Laptop I completely messed up the system. And at the end of one driver name there is a \"tested\". Does this mean that this driver is flawless?\n\nA: Tested at the end of the driver name in the Additional Drivers utility means the driver is considered to be first class in terms of stability and reliability. Other drivers that are not tested could be considered to be second class by comparison.\nThe reason why there are different grades of graphics card drivers is that for newer models of graphics cards the tested graphics card driver does not always work properly. The same thing goes for very old graphics cards that only work properly with either a legacy graphics card driver or the default built-in open source graphics card driver.

I have attached the benchmark test finding for my new computer. The test is for USB 3, and in the result the writing speed is only 23.8 Mb/s but the reading speed is ok as expected for usb 3. Can any one please give me a solution how to solve the problem I am facing with my new computer. I am using HP 250 G1 Notebook PC. Thank you in advance.\n\n\nA: There are two speeds to take into account: one is the bus' speed and the other one is the drive's speed; the lowest of the two is a bottleneck and sets the maximum overall speed you're going to get.\nUSB 3.0 on his own caps at 4.8 Gbps (600 MB/s), but reasonably only SSDs might reach that cap; commercial (even not cheap) USB flash drives are usually way slower; USB hard drives, IME, can reach around 80 MB/s when writing sequentially.\nSo the fact that a drive is USB 3.0 compatible doesn't mean that its speed will match USB 3.0's specifications, because that depends on the drive itself; the only thing you can safely assume from the fact that a drive is USB 3.0 compatible is just that, when plugged into a USB 3.0 port, in case the drive itself can reach a speed higher than 480 Mbps (which is something USB 3.0 hard drives, IME, usually do), it will not be bottlenecked by the bus; for a USB flash drive, speed-wise, IME, USB 2.0 is plenty already, because they are usually terribly slow compared to USB hard drives.\n", "Q: \"+y does not copy to the clipboard I am trying to copy a piece of text to the system clipboard. First, I do  a visual selection: select \" then + then y. \nI then get a message 7 lines yanked. When I press p, the data is pasted in vim; but, when I'm trying to paste data to any other program - no result. How do I solve this problem?\n\nA: Type in the terminal:\n$ vim --version | grep -e version -e +mouse.* -e +clipboard\n\nIdeally you have the huge version installed with the clipboard feature as well as a number of mouse features compiled-in. Just in case, please, report the result by editing your question.\nvi/vim use different clipboard(s) from your normal GUI: i.e. it has its very own clipboard, so if you try to copy/paste from a vim-opened file to anywhere outside vim with your mouse using CTRL+x/CTRL+v, you'll end up with .... nothing.\nI) try to use your mouse (after that I will get to your exact question)\nOpen a file in vim and highlight text with your left mouse button pressed down. Click on the highlighted text with the right button. If you don't see an enabled \"copy\" contextual menu choice, it probably means that you have set \nset mouse=a\n\nsomewhere in your vi/vim configuration. This option allows you to use your mouse in the 4 most common vim modes: normal (escaped), insert, visual, cmd-line modes. \nType :help mouse in your vi/vim session (normal mode) if you want to know more. If you have that option enabled you can still copy in vi and paste outside vim with your mouse. For that, just press shift as you highlight your text in vi/vim. Your vi/vim session shell will behave as if set mouse=a had not been set just for the duration of that task. This is referred to as the \"xterm handling\" of the mouse. You will encounter that expression if you decide to read technical stuff on this.\nII)  use registers from the visual mode within vi/vim \nThere are two registers you can invoke from the cmd-line while in vi/vim, as you try to copy something to later paste it outside vim. I will call them the \"* and the \"+ registers (not their real names). \n\n\n*\n\n*position your cursor in visual mode and highlight text\n\n*if you yank text with \"*y, then you can normally paste outside vi/vim, say in an .odt file, using the middle button of your mouse. The other register is NOT affected.\n\n*if you yank with \"+y, you actually yank to and subsequently paste from what's called the \"clipboard\". In that case you will clobber whatever was in the clipboard up to that instant. To paste outside vi/vim, just use the usual CTRL+v`.\n\n\nNote: After pasting, neither registers' state changes. They still contain the same stuff as before. You can go back to vi/vim and paste their content with either \"*p or \"+p (after the cursor) or perhaps also just p.\nYou can actually change the above behavior by making everything paste to the clipboard. Do :help clipboard from within the normal vi/vim mode to find out more about the clipboard. Usually having differentiated registers accessible with either \"*yor \"+y is fiendishly practical, because when you want to preserve what is already in the clipboard, you just use \"*y to yank or \"*d to cut out -> no disruption to the clipboard there!  \nIf somehow using \"+y or \"+d doesn't work for you, as seems to be case it is maybe because you have NOT installed all the compiled feature you need for your vim. In particular if you don't have the \"clipboard\" feature, go ahead and install the package vim-gtk from the Ubuntu Software Center, or: \n$ sudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n\nThat will set you up nicely, along with extra nice add-ons to interactively look at files written in C, Python, latex, Perl, Ruby and others, not to mention local html doc for vim if you need it.\n... which you do if you are going to do anything with vim really.  ;-)\nIf you do that, you might want to close all your vim sessions and perhaps even source your .vimrc file, although I am not clear on that. Logging out and back in won't hurt though.\nAnd this was just scratching the surface of vi...\nEDIT:\nFor section I): you can arrange for automatic X11 primary \"*y register copying upon selecting with the mouse in visual mode, by including set go+=ainto yr ~/.vimrc file.\nFor section II): If you have the clipboard feature compiled in your install of vim, you can map clipboard copying to CTRL+c by inserting :vmap <C-C> \"+y in your ~/.vimrc. Thereafter you will only need to highlight your text, do CTRL+c to copy to clipboard, and CTRL+v to paste anywhere outside vi/vim. No more \"+y needed here in this case. This specific mapping is only valid for the visual mode.\n", "Q: calibrate screen, gnome color manager (calibrate button disabled) I recently noticed that the white on my ubuntu is not exactly white, its redish. Now since I found about it, it is bugging me. How can I calibrate my screen so that white on my ubuntu is same as white on my windows.\nI tried gnome color manager but cant calibrate. I am not able to use any of the color calibrators? \nI have nvidia 820M and intel 5500HD graphics.\n\nA: Since you have an Nvidia GPU, you can use Nvidia X Server Settings to create your own color correction settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Nvidia X Server Settings:\n$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings\n\n\n*Launch:\n$ nvidia-settings\n\n\n*Find the Color Correction tab for the display you wish to calibrate (under \"GPU 0 - (Quadro FX 2700M) -> DFP-0 - (LGD)\" in the following screenshot):\n\n\n*Select the color channel you wish to change using the Active Color Channel selector, then modify the Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma as you see fit.\n\nA: Have you looked at redshift?

If you set temp-day and temp-night to the same colour, you disable this feature. Perhaps that solution will work for you.\nIf you do want the colour temperature to change at night, you would obviously need to change lat/long.\nIf you want redshift to autostart at login, select Applications/System tools/Preferences/Startup applications/Add. Name: redshift. Command: /usr/bin/redshift.\n\nA: Best to just create a color profile.  Locate a cheap colorimeter (I have an old spyder 3 unit), they are all plenty good to set the white/black points and get a reasonable color profile (don't read too much in to the marketing that you need the newer stuff for newer screens).  Use dispcalgui to create the profile.  Then just point the gnome color profile setting to the icc file.  you can also set it on the command line if you use something like kde that doesn't seem to natively support icc profiles.

You've done that, and it's not working in your case. That's not to say it's necessarily Boot Repair's fault, though; a lot of things that Boot Repair cannot control, or even detect, can affect the boot process. I have some specific comments on your setup (some of which aren't boot-related per se), based on your second Boot Repair output:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have four NTFS partitions, but it appears you have no Windows installation. (One of these four NTFS partitions is a Windows recovery partition, though.) It's possible that the Boot Repair output is missing the evidence of a bootable Windows partition; but if not, either you've accidentally trashed your Windows installation or you deliberately deleted it. If the former, you should stop fiddling with Ubuntu and fix Windows before proceeding. If the latter, you should not be using NTFS on a Linux-only installation, for numerous reasons. Unless you've got data on those NTFS partitions that you want to preserve, you're best off deleting them and continuing with Linux-native filesystems.\n\n*You're using BIOS/CSM/legacy mode on a computer that almost certainly uses an EFI/UEFI. Using the CSM creates all sorts of problems, as detailed on this page of mine. In particular given your symptoms, you sometimes need to play games with partition table details when booting an EFI-based computer from a GPT disk in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. There's a significant chance that this is why your computer won't boot with your current installation. You're probably better off disabling the CSM and doing an EFI-mode install.\n\n*It's possible that a leftover NVRAM entry from your Windows installation is blocking a BIOS-mode boot of your Ubuntu. You might be able to fix this by adjusting the boot priority settings in your firmware setup tool, but precise details of how to do this vary from one system to another, so I can't provide detailed instructions. Performing a fresh EFI-mode install of Ubuntu should override any leftover Windows NVRAM entries, which of course is another reason to do a fresh EFI-mode install of Ubuntu.\n\n*If you do have a Windows installation, it must necessarily be in EFI/UEFI mode. Mixing an EFI-mode Windows installation with a BIOS-mode Ubuntu installation is a recipe for frustration. Thus, if Boot Repair has missed a Windows installation, my general recommendation to install Ubuntu in EFI mode becomes a very strong recommendation.\n\n*Your disk is not big enough to need GPT. Given the presence of occasional quirks of BIOS-mode booting from GPT disks, you're probably better off switching from GPT to MBR if you want to stick with BIOS-mode booting. This can be done non-destructively with gdisk, as described here; however, there are caveats, and you'll need to re-install GRUB. Unless you need to preserve those NTFS partitions, you're probably better off wiping the disk clean and starting with a fresh MBR.\n\n\nOverall, your best bet is to start clean:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your NTFS partitions hold files you want to preserve, back them up to an external medium.\n\n*Wipe the hard disk with sudo sgdisk -Z /dev/sda. This command is destructive!\n\n*Disable the CSM in your firmware.\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer. It should boot in EFI/UEFI mode, as indicated by the presence of a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. (You can look for this directory by booting to \"try before installing\" mode and using a Terminal or file manager. If the directory is present, you can run the installer from the same boot.)\n\n*Install Ubuntu. Use default partitioning or the \"Something Else\" option, as you see fit. If the latter, I recommend the following partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A ~550MiB EFI System Partition (ESP)\n\n*A partition a little bigger than your RAM for swap space\n\n*A 20-30MiB Linux root (/) partition\n\n*The rest of your disk as a /home partition\n\n*Note that there's seldom a need in Linux for multiple data partitions\n\n\n\nAfter you install Ubuntu, the system should boot normally. There are multiple questions and answers here about installing Ubuntu in EFI mode, as well as information and tutorials elsewhere. For more information, check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI/UEFI works\n\n*The Ubuntu wiki's page on installing under EFI/UEFI\n\n*My page on EFI/UEFI-mode Linux installations\nI strongly recommend you read these pages before posting back with more problems; you'll be in a much better position to understand what's going on, and therefore to post a question that will produce a useful response, after you read the preceding pages. Ideally, you'll learn enough that you'll be able to solve your problem yourself.\n", "Q: How to change boot order in grub2 to include bootable USB? I want to install Windows OS in an empty partition(dual-boot) using a bootable USB. However I can't seem to enter BIOS to change the boot order. Can I include the USB in the boot menu in GRUB2?\n\nA: \nCan I include the USB in the boot menu in GRUB2?\n\nYes, it is possible. You have to edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file and add the following entry.

A great bit better than the mov-file playback.\nI've also tried playing the mov-files using mpv with poor results.\nPlaying the files on my macbook works flawlessly, so the media in itself should be OK.\nWhat else can I do to get playback working?\nEDIT per Gannets suggestions:\n$ sudo apt-get install libva-intel-vaapi-driver vainfo\nReading package lists...

However I'm encountering a problem I can't solve when using sed to remove duplicate words :\necho \"abc abc def ghi ijk ijk\" | sed 's/\\([a-z][a-z]*\\) \\1/\\1/g'\n\noutputs\nabc def ghijk ijk\n\nand it does that everytime a word finishes with the same letter as the first letter of the following word. What am I doing wrong ?\n\nA: The problem is that, as is, the regex can match partial words.  In the example you show, it is matching the i at the end of one word with the i at the beginning of the next.  The solution is to insist that the regex match whole words:\n$ echo \"abc abc def ghi ijk ijk\" | sed 's/\\<\\([a-z][a-z]*\\)\\> \\<\\1\\>/\\1/g'\nabc def ghi ijk\n\nIn GNU sed, \\< matches at the beginning of a word and \\> matches at the end of a word.\nMore complex matches\nIn the example in the question, the regex was matching on a single repeated character, i i.  Here is an example where it matches oat oat:\n$ echo \"smoat oats\" | sed 's/\\([a-z][a-z]*\\) \\1/\\1/g'\nsmoats\n\nThis is, again, fixed by insisting on whole words:\n$ echo \"smoat oats\" | sed 's/\\<\\([a-z][a-z]*\\)\\> \\<\\1\\>/\\1/g'\nsmoat oats\n\nSimplification\nSince alphabet to space transitions always mark a word boundary, the part of the regex above that uses \\> \\< is unnecessary because the regex requires that the characters on both sides are alphabetic.  Thus, we could use:\n$ echo \"smoat oats\" | sed 's/\\<\\([a-z][a-z]*\\) \\1\\>/\\1/g'\nsmoat oats\n\nDocumentation\nFor more information on the subtleties of sed and its regular expressions, I recommend the Grymoire tutorial.  The ultimate reference for GNU sed is the GNU sed manual.\n", "Q: Does lxtask accept cmd line parameters?

However with a keyboard shortcut in openbox you can resize to one half of the screen.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Keyboard lists the super (windows) key shortcuts plus arrow keys to snap to the side of the screen. However by adjusting ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml you could configure to as many different windows sizes as you want. \nAnother way to do this is maybe http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Applications\nFor per appsettings using openbox as the window manager. The position force and size properties in ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml will need editing. And then you will need to run openbox --reconfigure to get have openbox reload its configuratoin. I can't write the config arguments for you as I would need to know where and how many pixels. \nin the applicat\nions of the openbox config you will need \n\n\n  0   0  \n 25% 100% \n\nWith the x and y for where you want it on your screen or you can subsitute in other paramaters for putting it in other places on your screen.

(note: i accessed & copied my new files via puppy linux, still wasn't able to copy from live usb, though)\n\nA: Getting into recovery mode\nEssentially the steps are the same as described in this answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the computer\n\n*On the grub menu select Advanced options for Ubuntu. \n\n*Select any entry that says recovery.Image\n\n*Select root shell . Image\nWorking around root shell\nOnce in the root shell, you can view the logs and attempt to gain a slight idea of what the issue might be. Logs are located in /var/log directory. The logs that you might consult are dmesg.0, kern.log, kern.log.1, syslog.\nHere you can attempt to reset your own password, as well as create new user, in case your current username still fails to log in. That implies making chances to the system. However, initially root shell starts with your hard drive mounted in read-only mode. To allow changes to your system, do mount -o remount,rw /. \nChanging your own password\nThat is fairly simple. Run passwd yourusername . You will get a prompt that asks to enter new Unix password and confirm. \nCreating new user\n\n\n*\n\n*Run useradd -m -G sudo newusername , where newusername is the new username that you want to have for new account. This command also adds the user to sudo group, so that you have admin privileges on that account.\n\n*Run passwd newusername to create password for that user\n\n*Confirm that the new username works properly by runnning su newusername\nRegaining files with the new account\nYou can do this either from root shell or attempt to login graphically with new username first. My preference would be second choice.\n\n\n*\n\n*change ownership of the previous home directory with sudo chown -R newuser:newuser /home/oldusername. \n\n*At this point you can either leave the directory untouched (suggested) or move files to your new directory. If you choose to move the files, continue reading. In your new directory create new directory called oldstuff. You can use mkdir ~/oldstuff for that. \n\n*You can approach this from couple different angles. If you only want stuff in the default directories, like Pictures,Downloads, and Videos, you could run something like this : find /home/olduser/Documents/ /home/olduser/Videos/ /home/olduser/Pictures /home/olduser/Desktop -type f -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t ~/oldfstuff. Beware that this command takes all the files from all those directories and stuffs them into one, thus if there's any duplicate names , they might not be moved over. Now, better way is to use rsync SOURCE DEST, for instance rsync -r /home/olduser ~/oldstuff. \n\n\nLiveCD Recovery\nAs an alternative to the root shell recovery from grub, you can try LiveCD recovery. Basic idea is to take live media, such as installation USB or CD, mount your hard drive, bind certain folders,change root directory of the live media to the one on your hard drive, and change password or create users as described above. The process is well described on the Ubuntu documentation page. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n*Press Ctrl-Alt-F1\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt (note sda1 is just example, you have to find which one is your Ubuntu partition with lsblk or sudo blkid. For instance , I know /dev/sda5 is my Ubuntu partition because it is TYPE=\"ext4\")\n\n*sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\n\n*sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n\n*sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n*sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*sudo passwd yourusername\n\n*sudo useradd -m -G sudo newusername\n\n*sudo passwd newusername\n\n*When everything is done, sudo shutdown -r now to reboot back to your laptop's hard drive.\n\n\nA: When you boot from the live USB, can you access or copy the files on your hard drive?  If so, boot into the live USB, and find the files you want to retrieve.  Plug in another USB drive, and try copying the files to it.  If it doesn't copy, run nautilus as a superuser (gksudo nautilus) it might work then.  If you can copy what files you need to save, you have more options to fix your system's problem.\nI don't have a solution to the login loop, you may be best off just doing a clean reinstall, as long as everything you need off of the drive is saved somewhere.\n\nA: I had the same problem but was not able to solve it with your solutions. \nMy solution was to reinstall the proprietary driver of my graphic card (it was an nVidia). To do so :\n\n\n*\n\n*boot a previous Ubuntu kernel (at grub time, go down one line and select the previous kernel to boot using arrow keys)\n\n*download the appropriate driver installer from nVidia site\n\n*give it execution rights (sudo chmod a+x ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.72.run)\n\n*restart your machine and boot the new kernel\n\n*go to console mode (Ctrl+Alt+F1)\n\n*stop the x server (sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop)\n\n*run the driver installer (sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.72.run)\n\n*reboot your computer\n\n\nA: Have you try this:\n gsetting x.session Ubuntu\n\nand then this:\n sudo apt-get install liux-efi-amd64_ linux-efi\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n sudo apt-get -f install\n sudo aptitude linux-efi\n sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Can I Turn a Certain Version of Dolphin Emulator That Is Not Compatible With Ubuntu Into Something Usable on Dolphin?

As far as I know most netplay communities have since abandoned dc-netplay 4.0-652 as it is now considered obsolete.\nIf you still want to want to use it an option is to compile it from source.\n", "Q: Real-Time Volume Leveling & Audio Outputs I've been looking around for something like this, but the only solution I found here only works for one output, and is very inelegant. I want something that will raise quiet sounds, lower loud ones, and ignoring bass tones for when I'm playing music.\nThe catch is that I want this done for my entire system at once in real time (like the post above) and have it be something I can turn off and on separate from my audio outputs. I am hoping someone knows of a program with an interface I can use so I can easily adjust different aspects of the way the volume is leveled as well as turn it off and on without using long and clunky terminal commands, but if that doesn't exist I won't turn down another solution.\nSince this seems to me like an adequately similar question,I'll group it in with this one. there are a few things I'd like to do regarding sound outputs.\nI was wondering if/how I could: 1) - hide an output from the selection menu, 2) - rename an existing output, and 3) - make a default output that is always selected unless something else is plugged in, then that is selected. When it is unplugged, the default audio is selected again.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To level output volume we can apply LADSPA filters to our audio sink:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically adjust the volume based on content?\nSo after having installed the Steve Harris' plugins (swh-plugins ) we can issue the following commands in a terminal to create a sink with a compressor and a normalizer:\npactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=ladspa_sink master=<alsa_output> plugin=dyson_compress_1403 label=dysonCompress control=0,1,0.5,0.99\npactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=ladspa_normalized master=ladspa_sink plugin=fast_lookahead_limiter_1913 label=fastLookaheadLimiter control=10,0,0.8 sink_properties=device.description=Normalized_Sink\n\nReplace <alsa_output> with the name of your default sink.\n\nTo send this normalized audio to all audio outputs in our system we can use the module combined:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simultaneous output with paprefs no more working on ubuntu 13.04\nThe following command will create a myCombine sink from all audio cards available in our system further specified in slaves=. Replace the names of these sinks with those on your system.\npactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=combine sink_properties=device.description=myCombine slaves=sink1,sink2,... channels=2\n\nWe then can apply the LADSPA filters to this combined sink. This can be quite CPU demanding so not all systems may be capable to do that.\n\nFor a short documentation of the SWH plugins to be able to further fine-tune parameters see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Steve Harris' LADSPA Plugin Docs\n\nA: Those LADSPA filters are awkward to use and very feature poor, plus the documentation for them is simply TERRIBLE. \nI recommend using PulseEffects, its a fully featured GUI application that allows you to configure and stack effects (e.g. auto gain, compression, limiter etc) and apply them to individual applications like Chrome, spotify etc on the fly.\n", "Q: Need more help Key Binding Alright, so let me make this very clear, I am an entry level user on Ubuntu, I am still getting very used to it and I require help.

What is the ESP (EFI System Partition)? I know it relates to UEFI. Would I end up with a bricked computer that wouldn't even boot to UEFI/BIOS if it were to mistakenly get removed? Is it fixable if it does?\n\nA: \nwhat is the esp/efi partition?\n\nThe ESP (Efi System Partition) is a partition that contains, among other things, one or more bootloaders, which are loaded by the UEFI firmware upon startup, and which are necessary in order to boot an installed operating system;\n\nwould i end up with a bricked computer that wouldn't even boot to UEFI/BIOS if it were to mistakingly get removed\n\nIf you have only one ESP and no other bootloaders installed, deleting it will make all of the installed operating systems unbootable until a new ESP or a bootloader is installed; however this has nothing to do with being able to boot into the UEFI; the UEFI is a stand-alone piece of software built-in into an EEPROM soldered on the motherboard (which makes the UEFI, much like the BIOS, something erasable only using dedicated tools), which is meant, among other things, to search for and load a bootloader present in the ESP or in the MBR of a drive.\n\nis it fixable if it does?\n\nYes, all it takes it's either creating a new ESP (using, for example, an Ubuntu Live DVD) and (as Rod Smith pointed out) reinstall the bootloader(s) in it or installing a bootloader (such as grub) in the MBR of one of the drives.\n", "Q: How can I check a compressed file for reliability? I have a 5GB folder with my research from last year. To save space, I compressed the folder, and all its contents. The compressed file *.tar.xz, is 761MB, which seems really tiny. That made me wonder:\nHow can I verify the contents of the compressed file against the uncompressed directory?  Is 761MB really correct? how can I know? Is there an easy way to figure that out? Or, is there something which will give me more details about the compression? ... As in something that might say: Your 5GB folder will 761MB using this compression type.... \nThat information could be really handy to know. Right now, I am using options available for compression via the file manager, caja. I am using mate, Ubuntu 14.04.\ncommand line options are fine too.  \n\nA: You can use the -d command. Quoting from man tar:\n-d, --diff, --compare\n   find differences between archive and file system\n\nThis might be very time-consuming, though.\nExample in action:\n$ tar -Jcf bin.tar.xz bin\n$ echo foo >> bin/login.sh \n$ tar -Jdf bin.tar.xz\nbin/login.sh: Mod time differs\nbin/login.sh: Size differs\n\n\n\nOr, is there something which will give me more details about the compression? ... As in something that might say: Your 5GB folder will 761MB using this compression type.\n\nIn general, the only way to know what size some data will compress to is to actually compress it.\nxz is usually good at compression, and if most of your 5 GB was text, it could have compressed well (as opposed to, say PDF files or media files).\n", "Q: Partition scheme with dual boot win10 + Ubuntu 14.04 LTS i'm new to ubuntu so I don't know anything about how to allocate space for partitions and was wondering if anyone could me give some advice. \nI initially wanted to avoid using windows but ubuntu doesn't scale programs very well with my lenovo yoga 2 pro 3200 x 1800 high dpi resolution so I settled on installing both. \nit's 256gb ssd and after installing windows 10 I have 100gb of unallocated space left for ubuntu. now before anyone says to google it I have but with how old the information is and how different the information varies I didn't know if I should follow it.\nAlso I cannot select installing along side windows 10 there is no option for that my partition table was messed up so i had to use fixparts to allow ubuntu to recognise my windows 10 partition.\nany advice is greatly appreciated, please and thank you.\n\nA: When Ubuntu asks about how you want to partition it, select \"Something else\". These screenshots show Debian Jessie and Ubuntu MATE, but it shouldn't matter much.\n1: The situation.\n\nWe have the first section reserved for the first operating system, and the rest for Ubuntu (pretend that swap space isn't there).\nReproducing your problem:\n\nThis is what you mentioned before in the comments. It means that you haven't chosen what partition to install to. This is not a tutorial step; it's just in here as an explanation.\n\n\n*To fix it:\n\n\nIf Windows made an empty partition, it will be something like this:\n\nIt will have to be deleted and re-created smaller to leave room for the swap partition. Leave at least as much space as you have RAM, but more than double your RAM won't help much. If it's free space already, just skip deleting it (because it isn't there).\n\nAdd a partition with the little + button, set your size, select Ext4 and set it to be mounted at /.\n\nAdd another partition that fills the rest of the space and Use as swap.\n\nThat should do it. Check what it's going to do; it shouldn't need to format the first partition but will for the ones you just made.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu, it will look at your available drives and give you options based on what it detects. If you have free space, it will offer to install to the free space. It will also offer to install alongside Windows, which IIRC defaults to half of the space to each if it can (reconfigurable, of course). You can also set up partitions manually, but Linux partitioning is different enough from Windows partitioning that I would suggest you avoid it until you know a bit more.\nEdit: if your partition table is messed up,  you need to make a new one, which for you means wiping the entire drive. Then install Windows using whatever space you want (bearing in mind that Windows can't read your Ubuntu partition), then Ubuntu should detect and offer to be installed in the space you left.\n", "Q: USB formatting error I tried formating my USB using disks.

What does it mean? Any Problem/Error with that?\nHow to Rectify it?\n\nA: Those are just backups of your original files that gedit creates before saving changes to your edited documents.\nHow to prevent this ?\nIn gedit preferences you need to disable Create a backup copy of file before saving, and if you want to automatic save your edits automatically set a timer with the option enable Autosave files every X minutes.\nThat way the ~ will be gone and your last changes will be saved on the file every x minutes in case something goes bad or your computer crashes.\nThe changes made to the file will be saved to the file itself and not to a temporary file.\nPlease be aware that if you delete the contents of a file and auto save is enable there will be a chance that you end up with a saved empty file.\n\nA: The problem is pretty simple, actually. You can get to know it by viewing the properties of that file. It's a backup file for the text, a.txt for example. the ~a.txt stores the last save (probably) of the file (a.txt).

It then returned the result that all 1000 ports are closed. Why the difference between the two results when they are just scanning my local PC?\n\nA: You have different answer because fist scan to 127.0.0.1 is do not go through firewall. Second scan also included firewall rules.\nPort status\nOpen State\nAn application is actively accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams or SCTP associations on this port. Finding these is often the primary goal of port scanning. Security-minded people know that each open port is an avenue for attack. Attackers and pen-testers want to exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate users. Open ports are also interesting for non-security scans because they show services available for use on the network.\nClosed State\nA closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is up on an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, it may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall. Then they would appear in the filtered state, discussed next.\nFiltered State\nNmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. These ports frustrate attackers because they provide so little information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding are far more common. This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than filtering. This slows down the scan dramatically.\nUnfiltered State\nThe unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets, classifies ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.\nOpen & Filtered State\nNmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response. The lack of response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this way.\nClosed & Filtered State\nThis state is used when Nmap is unable to determine whether a port is closed or filtered. It is only used for the IP ID idle scan.\nSo in your case, the closed state of port might be because you don't have application listening on it.\n\nA: Since nmap shows only one open port for localhost and none for your external IP, one simple conclusion is that you have only one service listening, and it is listening only on localhost. The output of netstat for that port confirms this, since the service is listening only on 127.0.0.1:631 (IPv4 localhost) and ::1:631 (IPv6 localhost).\n\nA: When a program opens a listening TCP socket, it must first bind that socket to an address and port number. Most commonly, the address will be INADDR_ANY, which on Linux is the 0.0.0.0 address. This means \"any address on any interface may connect.\" The other common alternative is to bind to the address configured on a particular interface: either your device's outward-facing IP address or the special address of the loopback adapter (lo) 127.0.0.1.\nIn your case, CUPS is listening on port 631 on loopback. This means it cannot be contacted on any other address, even by Nmap. This makes sense for a system that uses CUPS for printing services but is not configured to be a print server for other systems on your network.\n", "Q: How can I change ports on an Docker container? I created a docker container with also the command part -p :8080 so\na random port from the host will route the requests to the port 8080 on the docker container --> 0.0.0.0:49153->8080/tcp\n I had to write -p 8080:8080 so the request to the port 8080 on the host will route this requests to the 8080 port on the docker container.\nHow can I change this that the port 8080 of the host will connect to the port 8080 of the docker container?\n\nA: All you have to do is -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 and that would connect the container port to the host port which both happen to be the same number. I personally prefer having the IP address there as well, just for self-documenting the code.\n", "Q: Unable to load Windows(8.x) Partition in Ubuntu I have a HP Laptop with Windows 8.1 installed and there seems to be some problem with the hard disk, due to which Windows never boots up. It just hangs at start up. I'm trying to recover some important files in my hard disk. I booted up my laptop using an Ubuntu Image. I was initially unable to mount the NTFS partition in Ubuntu. I got some error stating the partition is not clean. I ran the command 'ntfsfix' and it seemed to resolve some problems. After this, I was able to mount it using the following commands\nsudo mkdir /media/c\n\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/c\n\nNow the NTFS filesystem is mounted, but it shows only two directories - \"recovery\" and \"System Volume Information\". Any idea why the other files in my NTFS filesystem are not shown? \nI read that there is a problem mounting NTFS filesystems when Windows Fast-Boot/Hybrid shutdown mode is enabled(which is the default in Windows 8). Is this causing all the directories not being displayed? Any idea how I can recover other files from my hard disk?\nI tried the solutions listed in Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation, and I can mount the disk, but as mentioned above, it shows only 2 directories: \"recovery\" and \"System Volume Information\". How can I access the other files in the NTFS disk?\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: You've probably followed this answer and that's a dangerous thing to do.  \nUbuntu can easily recover data from a crashed Windows provided you don't have any hardware or Windows file system (NTFS) errors.\nTo get rid of NTFS errors you need to have Windows check your drive with chkdsk /f before attempting recovery under Ubuntu.\nThe \"best\" thing you can do under the circumstances you now have is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop working on the original disk\n\n*Make a full sector-by-sector copy of your disk onto a new disk using ddrescue\nAfter you've booted from the Ubuntu Live CD (the newest stable version is recommended) type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install gddrescue\nsudo ddrescue --binary-prefixes --cluster-size=64 --sparse --timeout=20s /dev/XdY /dev/AdB /media/ubuntu/ddrescue.log\n\nwhere XdY and AdB are the drive letters for the source and target drive. Ensure you don't copy the empty disk on the full disk. Examples are sda, sdb, hd0, hd1, ... Ubuntu doesn't work with Windows drive letters but with disks and partitions.  If you're unsure, ask!\nIf the copy doesn't give you the data you need, continue to the next step.\n\n*Use testdisk on the copy to recover some files\nIf you cannot recover enough, execute Step 2 again and continue to step 4.\n\n*use photorec on the fresh copy to recover some more files.\nThat's it!  You will not be able to recover everything but let's hope that 87.5% is enough.\n\nA: Sorry for the necropost. Actually, it looks like this user may have mounted the wrong partition because I get the same result when I mount the FIRST partition of a Windows drive, which is, in fact, the boot partition for Windows. In order to get to the C: Drive, you will have to type the following into your terminal emulator:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o ro /dev/sda2 /media/c\n\nThe location of your C drive may vary. You might want to look for the largest partition of the drive by typing\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThen, you can replace the \"sda2\" in the command above with the C drive partition and find the files you were looking for. Windows might not boot, but you will be able to access the files you intended to access earlier.\n", "Q: How to copy/paste from \"Sorry, the application XXX has stopped unexpectedly\" An app just crashed and I want to copy the error message and paste it into a search engine to hopefully find a solution.\nUnfortunately the error dialog does not allow me to copy/paste anything:\n\nIn particular the stack trace, which is very long.

If it did, try to create a new profile and run Firefox using that.\n\n*If step 1 failed, confirm that Firefox is really not running by using strace firefox command* in Terminal.\nIf Firefox exits by itself, the last several lines contains only exit_group(0).\nIn contrast, Firefox that exits normally upon user action (by clicking on Close x button or using Alt+F4 combination key) will contain close(8) close(7) exit_group(0) in the last three lines of *above command.\n\n*Optionally, backup your bookmarks by copying the bookmarkbackups directory that is found under ./mozilla/firefox/PROFILEDIR to somewhere for later use.\nIn which, PROFILEDIR may look something like XXXXXXXX.default for the profile that Firefox has created by default.\n\n*Remove the .mozilla directory which is found under the Home directory of current user.\n\n$ rm -rf ~/.mozilla\n\n\n*Purge the package (this is preferred than apt-get remove command, in case the package that has been downloaded earlier is corrupted when upgrading Ubuntu)\n\n$ sudo apt-get purge firefox\n\n\n*Install the package that is downloaded new\n\n$ sudo apt-get install firefox\n\n\n*Finally, run Firefox as usual.\nRestore bookmarks in Firefox\nIf you have done step 3, you can now restore your bookmark from the freshly installed Firefox.

The restored bookmark is found under Unsorted bookmarks > YYYYMMDD.\nWhereby, YYYYMMDD is part of the filename of *.json* file you had selected earlier and it is also the date the bookmark backup that has been created in your older install of Firefox.\nCompatibility notes\nThe troubleshooting steps should be applicable to recent Firefox releases on any Ubuntu releases, not just 12.04. I have decided to provide generic answer, since other earlier questions and answers didn't have this kind of advice.\n", "Q: Can not install steam: E: Unable to locate package I've  ran update and upgrade and are working fine.

It does not state that it will be set to the value of the HOME environment variable -- which indeed may or may not be the user's home directory.\nNote, as has been pointed out in the comments, that it is not recommended to run software as root.

I have a hard disk, which was partitioned before (probably in Windows) like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 0 - primary, 20Gb \n\n*Partition 1 - extended, 200Gb\n\n\nI have unallocated space after Partition #1, so I wanted to increase the size of the Partition #0. At first I wanted to move the Partition #1 to the right, so I started Ubuntu from CD and called GParted. All the logical partitions inside the extended partition aren't mounted. I've assigned the Partition #0 as swap (temporarily) because it looks like the Ubuntu needs the swap even when started from CD.\nThe GParted can resize the extended partition (Partition #1) but it can't move it. The left arrow in the slider is not movable.\nWhat might be a problem?\nAlso, the Partition #1 has a single flag on - it's \"lba\" flag. What's it for? Maybe it's the reason the GParted can't move it?\n\nA: Extended partitions are like containers for logical volumes. But unfortunately, you can't just move the whole container. \nMaybe it helps if you imagine partitions as cardboard boxes. A primary partition is a standard box and logical volumes are like little boxes that have to stay inside an extended partition. Now the interesting thing is how the extended partition would look like as box: It would be a box without a bottom!\nIt covers the small logical volumes, so to the outside (e.g. to the MBR partition table which only allows 4 partitions per disk) just looks like one big box, but if you would try to move it and lift it off the floor, all those little boxes inside (logical volumes) would still sit on the same place on the ground. You understand what I want to illustrate to you? By moving an extended partition (which does not work for that reason), you don't move the contained logical volumes.\nSo the solution to move an extended partition is to first enlarge the extended partition by moving one boundary to cover all the new space it should be moved to, then move all contained volumes to their respective new position, then shrink it again by moving the other boundary so that there's no unassigned space left inside the extended partition.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu (Desktop or Touch) on Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 (Windows or Android) I'm looking into possibly getting a Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2. This is a pure tablet device, that comes with either Windows or Android. It has an Intel cpu.\nWas anybody able to install Ubuntu on either one of those 2 flavors? What was the experience like? I don't mind using Ubuntu Desktop or Touch (or Ubuntu Next).\n\nA: I was able to boot from USB Drive after disable secure boot in bios. i also was able to install kali and ubuntu after removing windows from the 1051f tablet. i removed the windows installation and recovery partition (after creating recovery usb drive). \nTill now, bluetooth wont work. That means, you need a usb hub and keyboard+mouse. GPS wont work and auto-rotation for the display wont work.\n\nA: I wrote up instructions for getting Ubuntu (Desktop) installed on the Windows version (1051F): https://askubuntu.com/a/715843/463546\nHowever, the trouble is hardware support in the kernel. I couldn't get sound or suspend to work. People work on patching the kernel to support various things in various devices, but the SoCs used in these devices don't lend themselves to an easy one-kernel-fits-all solution. Perhaps sometime in the future it will all work out of the box, and it's possible patches already exist somewhere that will do their magic for the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 1051F.\n\nA: I use xubuntu 20.04 with small tweak, and know BKC800 keyboard work well:\n\n*\n\n*Install xubuntu 20.04\n\n*Download file: BCM4324B3.hcd\n\n*Copy file to folder: /lib/firmware/brcm\n\n", "Q: Concatenate table with a specific order I would like to concatenate the following table:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n...\n\nI am currently using:\nfind \"PATH\" name \"*.txt\" -exec cat {} + >> \"PATH/output.txt\"\n\nMy problem is that this command concatenate from A to X; indeed I would like to concatenate from X to A. Does anyone knows how to do that? Thanks\n\nA: Try sticking a sort in there:\nfind \"PATH\" -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | sort -rz | xargs -0 cat >  \"PATH/output.txt\"\n\nAnd note that, given the same PATH, output.txt might be included in this, so the results might not be what you expected.\n", "Q: When I manually start my own service it runs in the foreground, is this correct? I have created my own service by:\n\n\n*\n\n*copying my binary to /usr/bin/mcp\n\n*Create a daemon copying the skeleton: /etc/init.d/skeleton\n\n*Modify the skeleton bash script top:\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\nDESC=\"Runs my Service\"\nNAME=mcp\nDAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME\nDAEMON_ARGS=\"-d f -c /etc/mcp\"\nPIDFILE=/var/run/$NAME.pid\nSCRIPTNAME=/etc/init.d/$NAME\n\nOther than this the skeleton is exactly the same.\n\n*Then I create the daemon: \nsudo update-rc.d -f mcp remove\nsudo update-rc.d mcp defaults 97 03\n\nWhen I run the program manually: mcp -d f -c /etc/mcp, it works, but it never returns since its a service that is meant to always run. This is normal.\nBut now when I start it as a service: sudo service mcp start, I see the same behavior. I.e. as soon as I enter the start service command, the program runs, but now my terminal is stuck waiting for the program.\nI thought if you run something as a service then it should be running in the background?\nAlso I can't stop this service unless I open a second terminal. I kind of want it so that when I start the service it starts somewhere in the background and then you return to the command line. Am I doing something wrong here?\n\nA: Don't use an init.d service. Write an Upstart job instead. Here's an example. Upstart will take care of keeping the program in the background, logging, etc.\nYour service would be in /etc/init/mcp.conf, containing, for example:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop  on runlevel [016]\n\nexec /usr/bin/mcp -d f -c /etc/mcp\n\nThen you can do:\nsudo service mcp start\nsudo service mcp stop\n\nAnd so on.\n", "Q: Unable to create file /tmp/testfile: No space left on device i have really strange situation today over one of my Ubuntu Server. this is a web server, where One PHP website is running and i have programmed this web to move the File between the Mounted drive within the Network.\nBasically this Web app is providing the nice user interface , where user can put the files names and move within the all mounted Drives.\nMounted drives (some are smb /nfs and some mounted drives are FTP Destination.).\nand today suddenly i have got this error message :\nUnable to create file /tmp/testfile: No space left on device\n\nwhen i just want to create a test file and after doing df -h i found out the /dev/sda1 has 0 % space left and and nothing was possible on the server. and then i rebooted my server and then again my system was working fine and df -h  command gave me the result that /dev/sda1 again has more then 95% free space.\ni am trying to figure out why did i have this issue over my server?\ndoes it has something to do with my web app?\nthanks in advance.\n\nA: The only folder which gets cleaned at every reboot regardless of the running processes, which might handle their temporary files differently, e.g. by storing them into other places and / or by removing them from /tmp or from other places during the execution, AFAIK, is /tmp, so it's likely (but indeed not sure) that it's /tmp that got cluttered.\nWhat I'd suggest you to do is to check /tmp's size from time to time and to see if it gets cluttered, and then try to dig out which process / processes are causing the problem checking the biggest or most numerous files.\nI don't think the webapp itself might be causing this tough, unless it's starting some external process or unless it's the webapp itself that is putting the temporary files in /tmp; just to be sure, I'd also monitor the folders in the webapp's scope to check if a process started from the webapp itself is cluttering one of those.\n", "Q: I managed to get stuck with my Nexus 4 Ubuntu Phone, I can't reflash it back to the original ubuntu phone image?

You lose data (so backup needed before)\nOtherwise when the phone boot normally and for some others problems, I use the same command without the --bootstrap option and the phone on in developer mode (following the same guide)\nYou can for example use (or without the --revision option and maybe a different channel) : \nubuntu-device-flash --revision=[specific image revision number] touch --channel=rc-proposed\n\nWhen you use this, you don't loose data and I think it could solve apt-get issues (for example if you have installed somes packages with apt, it will remove them)\nMaybe using this command you will get the same \"pushing error\" (already happened to me), then you should try several times and maybe use an other cable or usb port (don't really know why this error is happening). For exemple, sometime I've tried it like 10 or 15 time.\nIf you still have \"pushing error\" anyway, you could try to flash from bootloader (loose every data and apps, like the --wipe option you used I think)\nHope this could help,\n", "Q: Windows Media Center DVR TV Tuner and TV Guide Replacement Does Ubuntu have similar software to Windows Media Center, specifically the TV Tuner, TV Recording and TV Guide features.

Since it is a virtual machine with its own virtual disk, should I choose \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" or will it have an impact on my actual disk with Win7? http://i.stack.imgur.com/EBXXR.jpg\nSecondly, if I choose this option there is a pop-up, what does it mean and am I supposed to accept it? http://i.stack.imgur.com/lS8NU.jpg\nThank you.\n\nA: No it will not effect your windows 7 os. Because the hard drive is virtual, you cannot edit the real hard drive it is stored on. So you should erase the vm \"hard drive\".\n\nA: The 'hard drive' in this case is actually a file on your Windows filesystem, used by the VM. Your Linux installation will not be able to affect anything outside of that file, which it sees as a physical drive. You can go ahead and 'erase everything...'\nAs for the second message, don't worry about it, for the reasons above.

Adding a static fstab record for a particular partition effectively prevents automatic mounting logic from handling it and this works great when I want the partition to actually be mounted (in a place I choose). But what if I want it to be ignored as if it just were not there? But I don't seek to hide it entirely. I don't mind if gparted can see it and a manual mount command is able to access it.\n\nA: Partitions will effectively be prevented from mounting by using the noauto option in their /etc/fstab entry.\n\nExample:\nThe following line will hide my ntfs partition /dev/sdb2 from appearing in Nautilus, from mounting with sudo mount -a, or on system boot:\nUUID=87654321FFFFFFFF /mnt ntfs rw,suid,dev,exec,noauto,users,async 0 0\n\nNow if we need to mount this partition then the following command will mount it to /mnt (or any other mount point we had defined in our fstab):\nmount /dev/sdb2\n\nIn case we only want root to be able to mount this partition just leave out the option users and replace it by nouser.\n\nA: I do not quite get what you are trying to achieve, but here is a  suggestion.\nYou can setup /etc/fstab to mount a partition to a hidden directory with no read permissions. That will do what you want.\n\nA: I have two data partitions that I mount at boot with /etc/fstab. However, I dual boot with Fedora. I do not want that to mount on boot (or Xubuntu from Fedora). Therefore, I just use udisks to mount those when I need to ('X' indicates partition number). \nsudo udisks --mount /dev/sdX\n\nYou can then set an alias or a keyboard shortcut for the command if preferred.

I have followed the instructions for setting up the the host system, including setting up the file /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules.\nI had been building Android 4.4.3, and ADB ran just fine as expected. (No need for sudo privileges.)\nHowever, when I built and installed Android 5.1.1, suddenly ADB complains:\n$ adb devices\nList of devices attached \n????????????    no permissions\n\nI tried several further mods to my 51-android.rules file, but no success.

SFTP logs show up in auth.log even without cranking up the LogLevel to VERBOSE.\nIs there anything I'm missing? Can anyone confirm they are able to get SCP logs to show up somewhere?\nThanks\n\nA: scp is executed internally just as ssh command and transferred files are not logged. You have only authentication logs in /var/log/auth.log or somewhere like this.\n\nA: I studied this once when I had to come up with a way to monitor SCP transfers. The OpenSSH scp utility doesn't log anything. It supports debugging output for the underlying SSH session, but that won't log the actual file transfers which are taking place.\nSimilarly, the OpenSSH server can be set to log detail about what it's doing, and it can be set to log the fact that a user connected and ran scp, but it won't log the actual file transfers which are taking place.\nIf you can't get these users to use SFTP instead, there are three approaches available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Investigate commercial SSH/SFTP/SCP servers. They should generally support logging file transfers.\n\n*Replace the scp utility on the server with one that logs the data you want. OpenSSH is open source. Someone who knows how to program in C for Unix could download the source and modify it.\n\n*Replace the scp utility with a \"wrapper\" that launches the original scp program and monitors what it does. There are debugging tools for Unix which can monitor what another process is doing.\nWe took the third approach. We wrote a Perl script which launched the original scp program under strace. Strace would output the names of files being opened and closed by the scp process. The Perl script read the strace output and converted it to log entries.\n", "Q: How can I connect laptop to my Epson Stylus Office BX600FW printer Printer worked perfectly prior to upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04.

I don't know what type of computer, how old, what specs, nothing. But probably it will have Windows installed and probably I will only be able to login as restricted user.\nBoth are things I don't like.\nSo I thought I could bring my own portable Ubuntu on a bootable 8GB USB stick with me. But you see that 8GB is not really much and USB is also not the fastest thing on the world, especially if the computer might only have 2.0 ports.\nTherefore I would love if I could outsource swap and probably even some data or system parts to the HDD of this computer, but I don't want to modify the existing system in any way, so repartitioning is not an option.\nI think creating a virtual file system image file inside the existing file system and mounting that one would be best. It should be encrypted though. \nAnd no, a simple live USB is not enough, it has at least to be persistent. However, the HDD using feature should be there too.\nSo how could I best set this up, a system installed on a USB stick that can create and mount an encrypted virtual disk on an existing file system without irreversibly modifying it? Detailed step-by-step guides appreciated, wherever the installation differs from a normal desktop installation.\n\nA: Regular file systems\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file on the existing file system on the internal drive of the computer (probably NTFS) for each (encrypted) partition, that you want to create, assuming the internal file system is mounted at /mnt/internal-drive and 1 GiB as the desired size of the resulting partition:\nhead -c 1G < /dev/zero > /mnt/internal-drive/some/arbitrary/path/partition.img\n\nIf you want a nice progress indicator you can use pv:\nhead -c 1G < /dev/zero | pv -s 1g -pterab > .../partition.img\n\nIf you want to create a partition based on a sparse file instead, use truncate(1) with the --size (shorthand: -s) option to specify the size in bytes:\ntruncate -s 1073741824 .../partition.img\n\nSparse files are fast to create and only occupy as much space as needed on the underlying file systems, but can become slow to access due to fragmentation. Some older file systems like FAT don't support sparse files. NTFS does.\n\n*Initialise the desired file system in the just created file, e. g. ext4:\nmkfs -t ext4 [FS-OPTIONS...] .../partition.img\n\nThe file system initialiser may ask you to confirm to create a file system inside a regular file or may even refuse to do so, unless you set a --force flag or similar.\n\n*Create a loop device backed by the partition file and mount it. Reasonably recent versions of mount(8), can do this in one step with the loop option:\nmount -t ext4 -o defaults,loop[,FS-OPTIONS...] .../partition.img /mnt/my-partition\n\n\n*Enjoy!\nSwap partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*Like step 1 above, but you probably want to avoid the sparse option.\n\n*Initialize the swap file:\nmkswap /mnt/internal-drive/some/arbitrary/path/swap.img\n\n\n*Swap-on:\nswapon [OPTIONS...] /mnt/internal-drive/some/arbitrary/path/swap.img\n\nBlock-level encryption\nJust like in the previous sections, regular files can be used pretty much like block devices. So you can use cryptsetup(8), crypttab(5), cryptdisks_start(8) and cryptdisks_stop(8) as you normally would, since they create loop devices for regular files automatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Like step 1 in the above sections.\n\n*If you want to use LUKS to manage your encrypted partition, initialize it:\ncryptsetup luksFormat .../partition.img [OPTIONS...]\n\n\n*Open the partition with your chosen encryption type and options:\ncryptsetup open .../partition.img <NAME> --type <DEVICE_TYPE> [OPTIONS...]\n\nWhere <NAME> is the name of the dm-crypt mapping to create for the partition and <DEVICE_TYPE> is luks, if you have created a LUKS wrapper in step 2, or plain for a plain dm-crypt partition. (cryptsetup supports other device types, but they're either legacy or for TrueCrypt compatibility.)\n\n*The encrypted partition is now available at /dev/mapper/<NAME>.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can create and mount file systems on it like on any block device as outlined in the above sections starting in step 2, or\n\n*you can create a partition table inside it with your favourite partition manager, if you want to wrap multiple partitions inside it without having to supply the same passphrase multiple times for them individually:\nfdisk /dev/mapper/<NAME>\n\nAsk the kernel to re-read the partition table and to repopulate the device node files in /dev:\npartprobe /dev/mapper/<NAME>\n\nYou now have the individual partitions available at /dev/mapper/<NAME>1 and so forth.\nMounting at boot\nYou can create fstab (and crypttab) entries for theses partitions just like you would normally, but with the loop option like above. File-based swap spaces don't need special mount options. You just need to take care to mount the underlying filesystem on the internal drive before these new partitions. E. g.:\nLABEL=Windows    /mnt/internal-drive    ntfs    defaults    0  2\n/mnt/internal-drive/some/arbitrary/path/home.img    /home    ext4     defaults,loop    0  3\n/mnt/internal-drive/some/arbitrary/path/swap.bin    none     swap     sw    0  0\n\nDestroying the file system afterwards\nShort version: Don't! Use encryption and destroy the key.\nLong version: Overwriting or \"shredding\" of individual files works under the assumption, that the file never occupied other drive sectors than it currently does (e. g. because the file system or one of its maintenance tools (e. g. de-fragmentation) decided to relocate them) and that no file data ever leaks into file system meta-data section (e. g. like during journalling). These assumptions may hold under most circumstances for older, non-journalling file systems (FAT, ext2). For NTFS, ext3/4 and HFS+ they don't hold reliably except under rare, impractical/unrealistic conditions.\nYou can go as far as to overwrite all unallocated sectors in addition to the sector currently occupied by the drive image file. Microsoft's cipher.exe can do this for NTFS, which supposedly catches almost all sectors, that may still contain left-overs of your precious file system image.\n", "Q: Suspension on my computer under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit won't work properly I have a problem about suspension procedure under Ubuntu 14.04.

I'm interested in the case where a new user is generated and no UID is explicitly given, leaving Ubuntu to automatically assign a UID.  I know that by default Ubuntu will generate a UID above 1000, but I want to know all about ubuntu's UID generation policy.\nA good answer to this question will clear up the following points\n\n\n*\n\n*What if the following two UIDs are already used: 1001, 2001 - will the next auto-generated UID be 1002 or 2002?\n\n*Is there a maximum UID?  What does Ubuntu do if some account already has been assigned the maximum UID (but there are otherwise free UIDs)?\n\n\nA: See /etc/adduser.conf:  \n# FIRST_SYSTEM_[GU]ID to LAST_SYSTEM_[GU]ID inclusive is the range for UIDs\n# for dynamically allocated administrative and system accounts/groups.\n# Please note that system software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd\n# package, may assume that UIDs less than 100 are unallocated.\nFIRST_SYSTEM_UID=100\nLAST_SYSTEM_UID=999\n\nFIRST_SYSTEM_GID=100\nLAST_SYSTEM_GID=999\n\n# FIRST_[GU]ID to LAST_[GU]ID inclusive is the range of UIDs of dynamically\n# allocated user accounts/groups.\nFIRST_UID=1000\nLAST_UID=29999\n\nFIRST_GID=1000\nLAST_GID=29999\n\nAnd, reading the Perl script at $(type -p adduser) or /usr/sbin/adduser, we find this function:  \n sub first_avail_uid {\n    my ($min, $max) = @_;\n    printf (gtx(\"Selecting UID from range %d to %d ...\\n\"),$min,$max) if ($verbose > 1);\n\n    my $t = $min;\n    while ($t <= $max) {\n       return $t if (!defined(getpwuid($t)));\n       $t++;\n    }\n    return -1; # nothing available\n}\n\nWhat this means is: adduser picks the first free UID between 1000 and 29999, or fails.  \nExact answer: 1002, It will pick a free one.\nThere IS a maximum UID, 4294967295, because UIDs are 32 bit fields, but adduser uses a lower limit.  \nHowever, there is also /usr/sbin/useradd BEWARE adduser and useradd are easily mistaken/mistyped for each other.  \nman useradd tells me:  \nDESCRIPTION\n   useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,  \n    administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.\n\n...  \n\n   -u, --uid UID\n       The numerical value of the user's ID. This value must be unique,\n       unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The\n       default is to use the smallest ID value greater than or equal to\n       UID_MIN and greater than every other user.\n\n       See also the -r option and the UID_MAX description.\n\n...  \n\nCONFIGURATION\n   The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the\n   behavior of this tool:\n\n...  \n\n   SYS_UID_MAX (number), SYS_UID_MIN (number)\n       Range of user IDs used for the creation of system users by useradd\n       or newusers.\n\n       The default value for SYS_UID_MIN (resp.  SYS_UID_MAX) is 101\n       (resp.  UID_MIN-1).\n\n   UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number)\n       Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by useradd\n       or newusers.\n\n       The default value for UID_MIN (resp.  UID_MAX) is 1000 (resp.\n       60000).\n\nOne reason that I use adduser, rather than useradd is the --encrypt-home option to adduser. Either one, however, could be replaced by editing a bunch of files, copying others, creating directories, etc using any UID one picks (Why, in the old days, I ...). There is nothing magic about adduser or useradd.  \n", "Q: How to create new user with sudo access My attempts at trying to create a new user on Ubuntu 15.04 desktop have been unsuccessful.\nSure, I get the new user and the login works and all seems fine.

I am trying to figure out if I can make a program bootup on linux, like a light switch. Power on and off at will.

They can turn the computers on and off whenever the car is turned on or turned off at will. How, can I go about doing that with Linux?\n\nA: Try to design your program to be stateless - read from sensors, receive data from network ports, write to serial ports and/or to network connections, etc, without writing to hard disks/flash memory. You could have read-only access to a configuration file, that is fine.\nIf this is not possible use journalling file system (i.e. ext4) and mount it with options sync,journal=data. This will do more writes to the storage media but will ensure consistency - if the power goes out in the middle of a write your program will see either the old version of the file or the new one. You would also need to add some checkpoint/restart functionality to your program. \nAnother advice: keep your files closed. Whenever you need to store something do open, seek, write, close.\nA bit more information about what are you trying to achieve would be usefull..\n", "Q: Questions about bootable USB stick (Ubuntu) on Windows When I create a bootable USB stick (Ubuntu) on Windows, does it mean that the changes that I will do (let's say save a new file called \"abc.txt\" on the Ubuntu desktop) will those changes be reflected the next time I boot this USB on some other computer (I will see the file \"abc.txt\" on the Ubuntu desktop)?\nNext one might be a pretty stupid question but here it is:\nWill it use the computer's RAM or use the space left on the USB as RAM.\nThanks\n\nA: That's extremely easy if you use the following set-up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your existing bootable USB stick to install Ubuntu on an SLC USB stick (USB 3.0 preferred if your hardware supports it) Just a normal install, treating the USB stick as an SSD.\nWhy? The SLCs are twice as expensive as the MLCs but they are 4 times faster and last 8* longer!  So they really are small SSDs on a stick!\n\n*Reboot from the USB and optimize the system and treat the USB stick as a small SSD, so:\nIn your /etc/sysctl.conf add:\n# Fabby: change the \"swappiness\" to 10 to prevent swapping as much as possible\n# to not wear out the USB stick as the Ubuntu default is optimized for a server.\n# 10 to balance with vfs_cache_pressure\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\n# Fabby: Lower vfs_cache_pressure to 75% \n# (once cached, probably not immediately needed any more)\n#\n# This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim\n# the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects.\n#\n# At the default value of vfs_cache_pressure=100 the kernel will attempt to\n# reclaim dentries and inodes at a \"fair\" rate with respect to pagecache and\n# swapcache reclaim.  Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer\n# to retain dentry and inode caches.\nvm.vfs_cache_pressure = 75\n\n# Fabby: Good to improve sequential reads (stop stuttering in movie play)\n# Can also be implemented per disk using udev rules\nvm.max-readahead=2048\nvm.min-readahead=1024\n\nIn your /etc/fstab add the bold paramaters to your boot USB line.

If you're not prepared to give up hard drive space to Ubuntu, you can burn the ISO to a second flash drive (even 2 GB is enough), boot it and install it to the 32 GB drive.

Can anyone explain how to fix this and make it an option again? \nUPDATE: I've been trying to figure out what I did wrong, and based on other things I read it looks like there's supposed to be a second boot partition for windows and that is what I accidentally deleted somehow.

As you are only interested in the IP addresses you should use the -n option so that arp shows numeric addresses instead of hostnames first.\nAlso you will typically get a lot of IP addresses depending the size of your LAN, so you should probably use an array instead of a variable to store the IP addresses.\nThe following command takes the IP addresses out of the arp cache and put them in array addrs :\naddrs=( $(arp -ni eth0 | grep -o '^[0-9][^ ]*') )\n\nHere is an example :\n$ addrs=( $(arp -ni eth0 | grep -o '^[0-9][^ ]*') )\n\n$ echo \"${addrs[0]}\"  ## First IP\n192.168.2.27\n\n$ echo \"${addrs[2]}\"  ## Second IP\n192.168.1.1\n\n$ echo \"${#addrs[@]}\"  ## Number of IP addresses\n37\n\nYou can use sed too :\naddrs=( $(arp -ni eth0 | sed -nr 's/^([0-9][^ ]*).*/\\1/p') )\n\nThe IP addresses will be shown in the first column, we are extracting the first column by [0-9][^ ]*. ^[0-9] here is to ensure that the line starts with a numeric so the first line containing header is discarded from the output.\n\nOn a different note if you have only one entry you can save it in a variable instead :\naddr=\"$(arp -ni eth0 | grep -o '^[0-9][^ ]*')\"\n\nOr\naddr=\"$(arp -ni eth0 | sed -nr 's/^([0-9][^ ]*).*/\\1/p')\"\n\n\nA: Here is another idea using awk\narp -ni eth0 | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}'\n\nExample\n$ arp -ni eth0 | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}'\n192.168.20.3\n192.168.20.1\n192.168.20.11\n\nor with a variable\n$ addresses=$(arp -ni eth0 | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}')\n$ echo $addresses\n192.168.20.3 192.168.20.1 192.168.20.11\n\n\nTo get a specific index without an array\n$ arp -ni eth0 | awk -v idx=3 'NR>1 && NR==idx+1 {print $1}'\n192.168.20.11\n\nTo get the maximum value for idx\narp -ni eth0 | awk 'NR>1 {idx_max++} END {print idx_max}'\n\nExample\n$ idx_max=$(arp -ni eth0 | awk 'NR>1 {idx_max++} END {print idx_max}')\n$ echo $idx_max\n3\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to ripping a CD via another computer?

[somewhat newbie]\nStumbled across juju 2 nights ago when looking for ways to use Ganglia and/or Rocks for cluster management and monitoring.  Love the \"deploy on AWS, yada-yada...\" of Juju - almost seems like holy grail of deployment to me.\nThen I started reading on building charms... and noticed that there are charms (experimental?) for Kubernetes.  If I have juju, why would I need Kubernetes ? or Mesos ? or Typesafe ConductR (new proprietary product) ? \nThere is also a ganglia charm... if juju is doing monitoring, why do I need ganglia charm?  Are there any heuristics for what are \"good candidates\" for charms?\nThanks,\nS-\n\nA: Kubernetes is a great technology for managing a cluster of containers.  It does that very well, but only works with containers.  Juju is more about service orchestration, dealing with virtual machines and also can orchestrate containers.  Juju can install and configure a Kubernetes cluster on GCE or AWS or any of the public clouds. Giving users the option to evaluate, develop, or use Kubernetes without having to know the details of the setup.\nWhile Juju does monitor the services it deploys, it is not a true monitoring system like Ganglia or Nagios.  Again you can deploy the services with Juju to build a solution with monitoring and save that to what is called a bundle.  You can then repeat that deployment of the bundled solution to other clouds if needed.\nA good candidate for a charm is any software service that you need or use.  There are many available at http://jujucharms.com, you can download those and use them now.  If you don't see something there that you know and use, that would be a \"good candidate\" for a charm.  Some people know certain software very well those would be a good candidate for writing a new charm.\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch: who decides to upgrade? And when?

I created a VM on Azure running Ubuntu 14.04 and installed a LAMP stack.\nIn Azure you have an so called enpoint configuration manager, which basically let you redirect incoming requests from one port to another on the hosted machine. So I deployed my first website on port 81 and made a redirect from 443 to 81 to make it work with the SSL certificate.\nNow I configured my second website on port 82 which works fine using http, but how can I now bind my SSL to it? Since I have an elastic IP I have to bind my DNS records to the CNAME of the machine which is called for example \"mymachine.cloudapp.net:port\".\nI am not so experienced in DNS / SSL / etc. So I think there must be a way which I don't know yet.\nSo far my only idea is to create one machine per website, which for sure is not the best solution. Using google I found plenty of workarounds for IIS but nothing for Apache 2.4...\n\nA: First things first, SSL is just a protocol and you can use any port that you want.  So answering your question:\nHow can you bind ssl to it?\nWell you pretty much need to buy an ssl and set it up for that site with that port (so basically you would have an SSL for each url and port combination you want (obviously there are SSL certificates that you can use for multiple sites with the same base URL). So you will just have to edit Apache .conf files to redirect that each app (DocumentRoot) to a different port.\nNow, my recommendation would be to use always standard ports:80 and 443 (for many reasons like: mental health, standards, etc.). What we actually do in the real world is that we have one server that hosts multiple VirtualHosts with one or more ServerNames, you can either buy them or just have a base url and then add a suffix or prefix to that domain.\nFor instance, I would have my base domain with something like this:\nhttps://example.com -> /www/mainApp\nhttps://admin.example.com -> /www/adminApp\nhttps://api.example.com -> /www/Api\n\nor if you go and buy domain names you could have something like this:\nhttps://example1.com -> /www/mainApp\nhttps://example2.com -> /www/adminApp\nhttps://example3.com -> /www/Api\n\nSo, basically I would get three SSL certificates, one for each app and you would have to configure Apache to respond to that domain name and go to the app that you need to serve, that would pretty much solve your problem. \nYou can read more about it how to configure it here. \nTry it out for yourself and let us know if you run into any more problems. I would also suggest reading more about Apache Virtual Hosts.\n", "Q: How do I install UBUNTU TOUCH in Nokia XL? Is it possible to install Ubuntu Touch in Nokia XL (Software Version 1.2.3.2) ?

When I boot the computer, everything works perfectly fine, but after rebooting using the button in the top right corner (eg after a kernel update), wired internet just doesn't work anymore. There's no problem with wireless, though (however, I mainly use LAN). It can't be a hardware problem, because it works on Windows (it is a dual-boot machine). Mysteriously enough, everything works perfectly if I just plug the notebook in before rebooting - even if I reboot on battery (-> broken) and then one more time on AC (-> fixed again).\nI've been doing some further testing: nothing changes if I cut the connection (physically, in the network manager or both) prior to rebooting. sudo service networking restart also has no effect with the output\nstop: Job failed while stopping \nstart: Job is already running: networking\n\nHowever, sudo service network-manager restart kills the connection in the same way as a reboot, forcing me to shut the computer down and then do a coldboot to get it operational again, but again only when the notebook is running on battery.\nI've been thinking_ \nWhat could be the cause of that behaviour?\nFurther command outputs:\nlspci -knn | grep Eth -A2:  \n05:00.1 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Therefore, my solution was to add\nsleep 1\nsudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g\n\nto rc.local (the value for sleep might be machine-dependant - I've replaced the HDD that came with the computer with an SSD, so for other machines it might have to be higher; the trick is that the command must be executed after the network interfaces have been configured). This way, wol is always activated, regardless of the power state - but with one exception: if you boot the computer on ac and pull the plug some time later, it reverts to the off-state. Normally, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, as you'd have to restart the network-manager via the command line to notice it - and if that really is necessary, a reboot might also be a good idea. Nevertheless, this behaviour can also be fixed by adding a small script to /etc/pm/power.d/ (similar to the one in the first answer to this question): in the battery-mode-branch, you put\nsudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g\n\nand the ac-mode-branch stays empty.\n", "Q: VirtualBox kernel issue. 3.19.0-25-generic I am attempting to setup virtualbox on a new Ubuntu install and have been running into issues.

I tried removing autocleaning out the current kernels and that didn't help.\nHere is the install record and you can see the error:\nhttp://pastebin.com/p3sqADhD\nFirst Installation: checking all kernels...\nBuilding only for 3.19.0-25-generic\nBuilding initial module for 3.19.0-25-generic\nError! Bad return status for module build on kernel: 3.19.0-25-generic (x86_64)\nConsult /var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.3.10/build/make.log for more information.\n\nAnd below is the make.log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/axbw9rni\nI am at a loss as to what's going on as I have done this before without issues. I have used sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nA: It is not uncommon that Virtual Box has issues on building for newer kernel releases. The developers do a great job in fixing those issues but they need some time to do so.\nThe issues with builing for kernels > 3.19 should be fixed in Virtual Box versions > 4.3.22, and issues with kernel 4.0 were fixed in 4.3.24, resp. 4.3.26 (see changelog for Virtual Box 4.3).\nTherefore whenever we are faced with building on any newer kernel we should upgrade Virtual Box to the newest stable release.\nIf a bug was still not fixed we should report this to the developers.\n", "Q: GCC compliler causing error of illegal refference for access noxim I am trying to run access noxim (network simulation too) on my Ubuntu 14 and concerning this source.\nhttps://github.com/habedi/SystemC-AccessNoxim\n\nI am using systemc2.3.1 for this purpose.

I do use HyperTerminal in Windows to send Data to my Micro-Controller.\nSo that I can't see such features in Ubuntu 14.04 and also how to configure COM Ports as well as list out the details of the COM Ports.\nHow to send the data using with Parity\\without Parity?\nHow to select baud rate ?\nPlease do refer any manuals regarding to that !\n\nA: HyperTerminal appears to be a Windows-Only program - HyperTerminal Website\nIn Ubuntu, there are many great built-in applications that replace the functionality of HyperTerminal, though, as well as great additional applications that are available for free in the Ubuntu repositories.\nFor instance, ssh and telnet are already immediately available for remote terminal login to devices over a network. \ncurl and wget are also installed by default and are great for running other types of network interactions, especially those involving http protocol.\nminicom can easily be installed from the Ubuntu Repositories and is a fairly popular application for accessing/utilizing com ports.\nIn case you are unfamiliar or just not yet completely comfortable with using a linux terminal for all of this, you can refer to the Ubuntu Community Wiki page for Using The Terminal.\nThere are many Linux terminal emulators to choose from and install in case you don't like Ubuntu's default terminal emulator. Most (if not all) of those can be installed from Ubuntu's Software Center. I personally favor terminator.\nIt might be an adjustment to launch and run all of these applications from CLI instead of a GUI, but you will most likely grow to prefer this method over the GUI of HyperTerminal over time, that is if you don't immediately fall in love with using CLI for all of it.\n\nA: Update: You need to add yourself to the 'dialout' group to access the serial ports:\nsudo gpasswd --add <your-username> dialout\n\nThanks to @Pilot6 for mentioning this. Until now I was using sudo for using the serial ports.\n\nIn Linux every device is is represented as files. For example, your HDD could be /dev/sda. A pendrive you connect will appear as /dev/sdx where x could be a,b,c...\nAlso in Linux, we don't use the term COM. If you connect a serial device, it will again appear as a file in /dev folder. It could be something like /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0 if it is a serial device. So if you want to communicate with the device, you can use the HyperTerminal Equivalent called picocom. There are other alternatives like minicom, but I use this picocom because it is very easy to use.\nInstall it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install picocom\n\nTo run it, type\nsudo picocom -b 19200 /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nHere I have specified the baud rate as 115200 and the device as /dev/ttyUSB0. For baud rate, refer to the documentation of the device you are connecting. /dev/ttyUSB0 is equivalent to the COM port name and will vary each time the device is connected and also depends on the number of serial devices connected(Just like in Windows, where it appears as COM1 on one connection and say COM2 when you reconnect it).\nTo find it, connect your device and execute:\nls /dev/tty*\n\nIt should be listed as shown in the image:\n\nUpdate: From the comments I understand that you only need to read the data. You can do this in linux without installing any software at all! \nFirst connect the device and then identify the device(ls /dev/tty*. Also Make sure that your user is in the dialout group. Assuming the device is /dev/ttyUSB0, set the baud-rate like this:\nsudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0  19200\n\nwhere 19200 is the baud rate.\nNow to read the output do the following:\ntail --follow /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nIn fact, you can also send data from the terminal:\necho <data> > /dev/ttyUSB0\n\n", "Q: Restore man user For some dislexic reason (or haven't slept enough) I typed\ndeluser man\n\ninstead of the more common\nman deluser\n\n... as you can imagine, I just deleted man user!

On the first HDD, I have windows 7, on the second HDD, I've installed Ubuntu, but I don't understand why can't I use Ubuntu.\nWhen I restart my PC, it doesn't ask me about Windows 7 or Ubuntu, Windows 7 simply starts.\nNote: When I've intalled Ubuntu I picked the second option \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\", because the first option did't let me install Ubuntu on the second HDD, only on the first one.\n\nA: You may have correctly installed Ubuntu on the second HDD, but most likely your BIOS is set to use the first HDD as the boot device. That's why you do not see the GRUB screen at all.\nYou just simply need to change the boot order in the BIOS. Or if it is easier, you can swap the order of the disks, by swapping the SATA connectors on the motherboard.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside windows 7? Is it safe to install ubuntu alongside windows 7?\nI have a laptop with 500 GB hard disk and 2 GB RAM and it is pre-installed with windows 7.My professor asks me to install ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7.\nHowever I am not sure whether it is safe to make a dual boot system? Will it affect my hard disk ?Is there any chance of a hard disk crash?\nPlease help.\n\nA: It depends on what do you call \"safe\"?\nThere is a risk of data loss if power supply fails during partitioning of the HDD.\nThere is also a risk that the person who installs Ubuntu removes a wrong partition or incorrectly understands what disk is. That it is not like \"Disk D\" in Windows. It is a physical disk.\nThere are lots of things that an inexperienced user can do wrong.\nThat is why it is always recommended to backup your important data first.\nBut if you do everything carefully, read manuals first, it can be pretty safe.\nYou can read this answer for directions.\n\nA: Usually this is perfectly safe, however if you need to change partition sizes (e.g. resize the Windows partition to half the size), this can be a bit risky. This does not mean that you should worry too much, but do have a backup.\nI am a dual-booter for nearly a decade, and never had any problems, but it is better to be safe, than sorry :)\n\nA: Microsoft has taken care that it becomes a lot more of a hassle than it used to be due to \"secure boot\".  You should search for a description on the Ubuntu forum for how to get this to run properly.  Don't attempt figuring it out on your own: that's just a recipe for frustration.  Be sure that you have a second computer with Internet connection available for searching on the forums/web/Internet whenever something goes wrong.\nAnother \"don't try figuring this out yourself\" is switching the \"Quick Start\" option or whatever it was called in Windows to \"off\": basically this is a suspend to disk and leaves the Windows file system in an inconsistent state.  That can become a problem if you then boot Linux (or possibly Linux won't boot) and try accessing the Windows partition.\nThose are the two things I remember when making my father's laptop dual-boot.  I haven't been using Windows myself for decades.  The Windows 7 (or was it 8?  Whatever the thing with the tiles is) stuff was the hardest I remember for a long time.\n\nA: If your installations are both clean, are done on a separate partition or HDD there should not be any issues.\nAnother thing to look for is the boot records. Make sure you have everything installed so that the master boot record (MBR) doesn't become corrupt.\n\nA: This is perfectly safe.\nUbuntu will partition you HDD for you and install itself alongside Windows 7.\nA very large number of Linux users run Linux dual-boot with Windows, and have no problems with it, since Linux can be run both on its own or alongside another operating system.\nBy the way, Ubuntu 12.04 will lose support in 2017, so if you want Ubuntu to last longer, install the 14.04 version, which is supported till 2019. It's the same as 12.04, but with extra features and bug-fixes.\n\nA: Like many other Linux users, I have been using dual boot systems for a long time now and I have created a few of them in the past. I made a few rookie mistakes the first time... \nI wiped out my entire hard disk... Back up saved me tho... \nSo it is quite safe but I recommend you do your research first, get as much help as you can and ALWAYS keep a back up. \nCheers :D\n\nA: There is no risk as long as you do it right as others have covered. \n12.04 is an LTS version but is pretty darn old, I can't see a reason to go with 12.04. Some people stick with 10.04 because it is a 2.6 kernel and they need specific kernel patches (RTOS) but if you are going to go to 3.x or 4.x (there was no major updates in 4.0 it was just a numbers thing) go with either the latest (best support) or the most recent LTS (decent support and support for years). There is a small chance your professor needs a specific kernel, gcc or other package version but this seems unlikely and can be fixed (will take time to learn, but that is what you are in college for).

If any of the packets have echo response from the router then it will wait for 5 seconds before stating the ping check again.\nNow if all 4 of the packets failed to get the response from router then it will sleep for 30 seconds so that we are not overwhemed by sudden network blip. After 30 seconds it will start checking with ping again, if succeeds this time the message There was a Network issue, Its Ok now will be shown.\nIf it not Ok still, then the message Network issue will be shown, then it will wait for 30 seconds and will start looping again until any successful response is received.\n", "Q: What codecs does Ubuntu support by default?

become part of different virtual network and I can not ping them from each other\nCan anybody help me in identifying and fixing problem\nCan anyone also explain whats difference between NAT and NAT Network\n\nA: According to VirtualBox manual, these are the network possibilities for your VMs:\n\n\n*\n\n*NAT:  Internal network between VM and host. Besides you can access to the Internet. Two or more VMs in NAT mode don't have connectivity among them, only with the host and Internet.\n\n*Internal: All VMs with this configuration will have connectivity among them but not with the host nor Internet.\n\n*Host only: A virtual network will be created between the host and all the VMs with this configuration, but you will have no Internet access.\n\n*NAT Network: You can reach all VMs in the same pre-defined NAT network and the host, but you won't be able to connect to Internet.\n\n*Bridged: Your VM will be in the same network that your host as if it were other computer/server in this network, and thus, it will have Internet acces if your host has.\n\n*Generic: Advanced and more specific configuration rarely used.\nSo, if you want to create an internal network with connectivity to the host choose NAT Network, but notice that you will have no Internet access. NAT is set only when you just want Internet access from your VM and nothing else.\nHowever none of these settings are ok with you if you want to have either connectivity between both VMs and the Internet. As far as I know, your only choice is to configure both VMs in bridged mode, so they will be 'different' computers in you host network and you will be able to ping them all and the Internet from any of them.\nOn the other hand, it seems that you clonned one VM from the other because both machines have the same MAC address (HWaddr in ifconfig command info), be aware that you should check the checkbox that reads \"Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards\" when clonning. Two devices with the same MAC address always creates problems.\nI am not an expert in VirtualBox so maybe other users can tell you other posible configurations to get what you want. I hope you find this information useful. \nFor more information you can read this.\n\nA: Why not working?\nIn 16.04 (and probably 14.04) the NAT Network feature of the main packaged version of VirtualBox (5.0.36) is bugged.\nCheck it!\nYou can check it yourself: if the ls /usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxNetNAT executable is present, then you may have some other kind of issue.\nFix it!\nThis bug is fixed in newer versions. So you should install a new version:\nRemove old version\nFor example if you installed using apt you could run:\nsudo apt remove virtualbox --auto-remove\n\nInstall new version\nThe fix is available for newer versions (Ubuntu yakkety+). For older versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the virtualbox.org, and download the newest version manually\n\n*OR\n\n*Use the following script:\n# add the official repository\nwget -q -O - https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc | sudo apt-key add -\necho deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian `lsb_release -cs` non-free contrib | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.org.list\n# install the newer version\nsudo apt install virtualbox-5.1\n\n\nA: I ran into this using VirtualBox 5.0.40 from the default apt repository. To get around it, I configured each VM to use two network interfaces.\n\n\n*\n\n*Adapter 1: Bridge Addapter (to your real nic)\n\n*Adapter 2: NAT Network (of your choice)\n\n\nUnder the guets OS (Ubuntu 16.04), you will need to tweak /etc/network/interfaces in order for the second interface to show up. In my case, I needed VMs to use static IPs inside the NAT Network, so this is what I got.\n## Bridge to Internet\nauto enp0s3\niface enp0s3 inet dhcp\n\n## NAT Network among VMs\n## Static is optional\n## DHCP if you don't need it\nauto enp0s8\niface enp0s8 inet static\n  address 10.10.11.100\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nThis, of course, assumes my NAT Network uses the subnet 10.10.11.0/24. Adapt numbers to your scenario or just leave it to dhcp, as you wish.\nNOTE: One important thing to note in the static config is that, for this particular scenario, you CANNOT assign it a default gateway. Giving enp0s8 a default (like 10.10.11.1) will cause the OS to create a route to this gateway and that route can also screw up your internet access as well. You should only need to do that when this particular interface needs routes to other networks, aside from the one configured to it.\nTo find out interface names assigned by Ubuntu for your environment, you can dmesg | grep eth.\n\n\nA: This might be a bug in VirtualBox. I've experienced the same (Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, VirtualBox 5.0.32_Ubuntu r112930): Set up a NAT Network, configured that for two Ubuntu VMs. Each VM could ping / SSH into the other, and via port forwardings I could SSH from the host into each VM. But no Internet access from inside the VMs. A colleague tried the same with a Windows host, VirtualBox (unknown version), and the same VMs, and it worked.\nAs a workaround, I've configured a second network card for each VM: The first one using NAT to access the Internet, the second using \"NAT Network\" to access the other guest(s). I had to set up the SSH port forwarding on the first (NAT) card, and configure a different SSH port on one VM (i.e. 2222 -> 22 on VM1, 2223 -> 23 on VM2).\nBased on the documentation, both NAT and NAT Network should be able to access the Internet. The difference is that the first has segregated host ↔ guest connections, so guests cannot access each other, only the host. The latter pools all guests into a single network (and provides services such as DHCP), so that they can access each other.\n", "Q: Error when creating debain source package with dpkg When entering this dpkg-source -b <packagename> into the terminal to create a debian source package, I get the following error:\ndpkg-source: error: syntax error in ResolutionX_1.0-0/debian/control at line 9:\nfirst block lacks a source field\n\nWhat does this mean?\nMy debian control file contains:\nPackage: ResolutionX\nVersion: 1.0-0\nSection: base\nPriority: optional\nArchitecture: all\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 9)\nMaintainer: xx \nDescription: ResolutionX\n    A simple tool to enable you to have your desired resolution without requiring graphics drivers.\n\nA: Package: ResolutionX\nVersion: 1.0-0\nSection: base\nPriority: optional\nArchitecture: all\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 9)\nMaintainer: First_name Last_name \nDescription: ResolutionX\n    A simple tool to enable you to have your desired resolution without requiring graphics drivers.\n\nThis paragraph is a mish-mash of fields for source and binary packages.\nThe first paragraph should describe the source package.

Whenever I try to navigate to the site, I just get the default apache page. I've disabled the 000-default.conf and enabled OSSEC-WUI.conf (the name of my site's configuration file in /etc/apache2/site-available). However, I'm still getting the default apache page. What do I need to do to get my site to display?\nHere's how I set up my apache2.conf file:\n# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the\n# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.\n# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about\n# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific\n# hints.\n#\n#\n# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:\n# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to\n# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

SSH lets you send special commands to SSH itself (not the shell you logged into) using certain \"escape\" sequences. From man ssh:\nESCAPE CHARACTERS\n When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, ssh supports a number of\n functions through the use of an escape character.\n\n A single tilde character can be sent as ~~ or by following the tilde by a\n character other than those described below.  The escape character must\n always follow a newline to be interpreted as special.  The escape\n character can be changed in configuration files using the EscapeChar\n configuration directive or on the command line by the -e option.\n\n The supported escapes (assuming the default ‘~’) are:\n ...\n\n ~V      Decrease the verbosity (LogLevel) when errors are being written\n         to stderr.\n\n ~v      Increase the verbosity (LogLevel) when errors are being written\n         to stderr.\n\nSo, if you pressed Enter for the username prompt, then ~V as the first two characters of the password, SSH would interpret that as a command to increase the log verbosity.\nSo, over SSH, to enter ~V as the first two characters of a password, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press ~ twice so that it gets treated as a literal ~ (per the second paragraph in the quote above): ~~V, or\n\n*Do something at the start of the prompt to break the sequence (type a character and delete it, for example).\n\n", "Q: Wifi connectivity issues in Ubuntu 14.04 [HP pavilion 15 series] I am very much new to ubuntu and this communtiy and i recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 (alongside windows 10) on my newly purchased laptop(hp pavilion 15-ab032tx).\nThere's some serious issues with the wifi connections in ubuntu. \nIf I am sitting very close(1 -2 feet) to my router it diplays the connection but gives a very low connection speed.\nIf I go to a distance more than say 5 feet, it shows the connection to be out of range.\nI followed some previous threads regarding this issue but i haven't been able to solve the problem.\nI also made some changes to the power management of my wireless card( as instructed in another thread) but it also didn't work.\n(NOTE: WiFi works perfectly fine on windows 10)\nhere's some information regarding my wireless card:- \n ***-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:08:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 00\n       serial: 70:77:81:12:70:59\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=rtl8723be driverversion=3.16.0-45-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.1.12 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:18 ioport:5000(size=256) memory:c6100000-c6103fff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8101E/RTL8102E PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 0a\n       serial: 3c:a8:2a:ae:32:43\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full ip=192.168.1.13 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:64 ioport:4000(size=256) memory:c6004000-c6004fff memory:c6000000-c6003fff**\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First upgrade the kernel to 3.16 as shown in accepted answer at this link\n\n*Reboot into the new 3.16.x by command sudo reboot.\n\n*After rebooting, run sudo apt-get -f autoremove\n\n*Now we have to remove old kernel, for that, first list the kernels currently present by command sudo dpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\n*It gives a list of kernels, identify the older version, for example linux-image-3.11\n\n*Give command sudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.14\n\n*Now give command : sudo update-grub2\n\n*Now reboot by sudo reboot\n\n*Now we have to install realtek driver.

I defined a subnet on eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces with:  \n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)  \nauto lo  \niface lo inet loopback  \n\nauto eth0  \niface eth0 inet static  \n        address 192.168.1.1  \n        netmask 255.255.255.0  \n        network 192.168.1.0  \n\nThis subnet will be used to communicate to a Raspberry Pi connected on my ethernet port. Internet connection is not needed because already provided by wifi.\nI was expecting my laptop to get the static ip address 192.168.1.1 when I run sudo ifup eth0 and it's the case. However, route -n shows:\nKernel IP routing table  \nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface  \n... (bunch of things) ...  \n169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do I have a 169.254.0.0 line?  \n\n*I believe it's unnecessary. How do I remove it?\n\n\nA: From the quoted link:\n\nIf a DHCP client attempts to get an address, but fails to find a DHCP\n  server after the timeout and retries period it will randomly assume an\n  address from this network. This allows communication with hosts that\n  have failed to obtain a DHCP address.\n\nHowever, your interfaces file requests a static IP address that is likely impossible, so no valid address was given.\n192.168.1.1 is likely the address of the router or other access point to which you are attempting to connect. Therefore, the address will not be granted. Moreover, if you expect to connect to the internet, you will need to specify DNS nameservers. May I suggest:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\n\nOf course verify the exact details before you proceed.\nRestart the interface:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup -v eth0\n\nCheck:\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n\nA: Per RFC 3927 (emphasis mine):\n\nTo participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be\nconfigured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by\nthe user or automatically from a source on the network such as a\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.  Unfortunately,\nsuch address configuration information may not always be available.\nIt is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a\nuseful subset of IP networking functions even when no address\nconfiguration is available.  This document describes how a host may\nautomatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the\n169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices    connected to the same physical (or logical) link.\n\nSo, to summarize, the 169.254/16 subnet was reserved to allow for communications between two physically (or logically, e.g. through a switch) connected devices without having to rely on DHCP or manual assignment of static IP addresses.\nTo quote the Wikipedia article on private networks,\n\nIf a host on an IEEE 802 (Ethernet) network cannot obtain a network\naddress via DHCP, an address from 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255 may\nbe assigned pseudorandomly.\n\nAs an example of its usage, say you have two embedded devices that need to communicate with one another via a direct Ethernet connection, but you want one or both devices to first look for DHCP so they also have the possibility of being connected into a local area network. When the devices are connected directly together and there is no DHCP available, the devices may use a protocol such as multicast DNS to discover each other automatically, but each device must first have some arbitrary IP address assigned so they can actually talk to each other over the Ethernet link. Thus, the operating system automatically assigns an IP address to the Ethernet device from the 169.254/16 network.\n\nNow, as for why that route is there in the routing table by default...if you look at /etc/networks, you can see that the 'link-local' network is defined as being in this subnet:\n$ cat /etc/networks\n# symbolic names for networks, see networks(5) for more information\nlink-local 169.254.0.0\n\nIf you take this file's advice and check out man networks, you'll see:\n\nThis file is read by the route(8) and netstat(8) utilities.\n\nSo the route is created automatically on boot after route reads that file.\n\nThe route is only necessary if you plan to actually use link-local communications and don't want to assign a static IP address to the connected devices. But it doesn't do any harm to leave it in if you don't.\nHowever, if you really want to remove it, you can do so with\nsudo route del -net 169.254.0.0 gw 0.0.0.0\n\nOr to remove it permanently, you should be able to just comment out its entry in /etc/networks and reboot.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, 169.254.0.0 is present in your routing table because ifup is setting up the link-local network.\nTo avoid this, consider using ifconfig instead of ifup.\nIf necessary, run ifdown first.\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1\n\nifconfig does less work and does not read /etc/network/interfaces.\nIt should be possible to share internet access with the Pi.  You need to turn on packet forwarding in the kernel on your laptop.  I think this can be done without rebooting.  I have done it in the past, but do not know how to do it off the top of my heard.  This might help:\nHow do I bridge network interfaces?\n", "Q: dh_install fails with missing files I am attempting to build a deb from an existing autotools based library.

I got:\ndpkg -l | egrep 'linux-tools-|linux-source-|linux-libc-dev|linux-image-|linux-headers-'| egrep -v $(uname -r | sed -e 's/-generic//')  \n\nThis produces a list of candidates for sudo apt-get remove. Eliminate from this list your current kernel and all of its like-versioned kin (I did that in the last egrep) AND the previous N versions. Start with N=3, use N=2 with caution, and try to avoid the N=1 case.  \nDO NOT REMOVE YOUR CURRENT KERNEL\n", "Q: Touchpad disabled at boot?

Reboot and see if the touchpad is enabled upon reboot;\nIn any case, if not needed, I'd suggest to remove the set -e command at the top of /etc/rc.local, or to modify the way the script is called calling e.g. a wrapper which calls the script itself and which always returns 0, to avoid the script breaking the execution of rc.local due to return values different from 0.\n", "Q: While running the Ubuntu-Tweak Janitor, it got hanged, Why?

When I needed to reinstall the system I tried again, but this time it wouldn't boot from usb unless it was in legacy mode. After installing Ubuntu now requires legacy mode to boot too.\nSo, can Ubuntu be convinced to setup uefi once it's installed?\n\nA: Yes you can, even with MBR partitioning. In principle, you \"just\" need to install an EFI boot loader for Linux. I put \"just\" in quotation marks because there are a lot of pesky details in this process that can turn it into a nightmare, particularly if you're unaware of the details or if something goes wrong when dealing with one of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*In theory, an EFI should be able to boot from an MBR disk as well as from a GPT disk. In practice, that doesn't always work; some EFIs seem to be unwilling to boot from an MBR disk. The partition table type can interact with the NVRAM entry (described later), since some EFIs don't like creating NVRAM entries that refer to MBR disks. Thus, you might need to do an MBR-to-GPT conversion. In most cases, this is easily done with gdisk (see its documentation on the subject. Sometimes, though, as detailed in that documentation, you might need to slightly shrink the final partition on the disk.\n\n*To boot in EFI mode, your disk needs an EFI System Partition (ESP). Thus, unless you happen to have sufficient unpartitioned space (~100-600MiB), you'll have to resize at least one partition to make room for the ESP, then create it. Note that you can't mark an ESP on an MBR disk with parted, GParted, or anything else based on libparted; you'll need to use fdisk to give it the right type code (0xEF).\n\n*You must install your EFI boot loader. This means copying files. Tools like grub-install (for GRUB) or rEFInd's install.sh help automate this process. Some other boot loaders (such as ELILO and gummiboot) are just one or two files, so copying them by hand is quite easy, although setting up their configuration files may take more manual effort.\n\n*Ordinarily, EFI boot loaders must be registered with the EFI and their locations stored in NVRAM. This can be done with the efibootmgr utility in Ubuntu, but this utility works only when the computer is already booted in EFI mode. As a workaround (which might especially be needed on an MBR disk), you can give the boot loader the filename EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP. (The ESP is normally mounted at /boot/efi, so the full path would be /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi under Ubuntu, if the ESP is mounted at the conventional location.)\n\n*IIRC, the Ubuntu installer won't install to an MBR disk in EFI mode. This won't affect an after-the-fact conversion, but it may cause you problems in the future, if/when you want to upgrade your Ubuntu version or re-install the OS.\n\n\nIf you know what you're doing, setting all this up is easy. If you don't, you won't know where to begin. With any luck, this answer will at least help you begin. For more information, I recommend you read:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog post about EFI-mode booting, which provides background information to help you understand what you're doing.\n\n*My own Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page, which covers the \"nuts and bolts\" of several EFI boot loaders for Linux and how to install them.\n\n\nOne further point: You can probably boot your computer into EFI mode right now with no changes to your on-disk configuration. The trick is to use a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager on it. If you boot rEFInd, it will scan your system for EFI boot loaders. The key is that the Linux kernel itself is an EFI boot loader (or has been since version 3.3.0, assuming the option has been compiled into the binary, which is the case for Ubuntu's kernels). Thus, rEFInd booted from a USB flash drive or CD-R should give you an option to boot Ubuntu. There are a number of caveats, though, such as the need for the kernel to be on a filesystem that rEFInd can read and the fact that you'll need to enter extra kernel options if you use a separate /boot partition. If this method works for you, though, you can boot into EFI mode now. The main advantage of this for your situation is that you'll be able to use efibootmgr to install whatever boot manager you like to your hard disk. Down the road, rEFInd can also be helpful for emergency recovery; if your GRUB 2 installation goes south, rEFInd may enable you to boot and fix the problem.\nOf course, jumping through all these hoops will take time and effort. If the Ubuntu installation is fresh, it's likely to be easier to re-install. The key here, given what you've written, is likely to be to re-create your Ubuntu installation disk, but do it properly. If the disk you've got now refuses to boot in EFI mode, chances are it lacks an EFI boot loader. You didn't say what tool you used to create the disk, but switching to another tool may help. Some tools also offer options (such as partition table type) that may affect the ability to boot in EFI mode. Personally, I generally use dd to copy the .iso file to a USB drive, as in:\nsudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nThis example copies imagefile.iso to the USB drive at /dev/sdc. Be aware, though, that dd can be dangerous! Pay particular attention to the of= option, which specifies where the image will be written. If you type the wrong value here, you could wipe out your hard disk!\nAlso, disabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your firmware may help. The CSM is what provides BIOS compatibility, so if you disable the CSM, the computer can't boot in BIOS mode (aka \"legacy mode\" -- and firmware options sometimes refer to the CSM using that term). Details of how to disable the CSM vary from one computer to another, though. See this page of mine for more on this subject.\n", "Q: Any command I enter ends with Extra junk after value. Why?

I was not able to access the BIOS menu.  \nI tried pressing F12, F2, Esc and Del on subsequent attempts only to enter the GRUB menu.\nDistribution information:\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\nLinux jim-OptiPlex-755 3.13.0-61-generic #100-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI even installed and ran boot-repair to no avail.  The information on this is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/1205935.\nI have been using Linux for 8 years, however, this problem is beyond my limited expertise.  Any advice and directions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Assuming the system is CMOS based, installing an OS wouldn't remove access to the BIOS.\nHowever, the wait period may be so fast you can't press the button fast enough. The first thing to try is resetting the BIOS back to defaults by setting the CMOS bypass, usually a small yellow piece of plastic connected to two of three pins. Move that piece to it covers the other pin an restart your computer.\nThis should force boot you into the BIOS. Remember to return the bypass piece to its original position. \n", "Q: One port over wifi, other use lan I Am working in a place where my imap for e-mail (using thunderbird) is only open over wifi. The rest will mostly work only over wired (and is quicker  anyway).\nSo what is the best option to use my mail (lets say the imap port for smtp 993 and 465) over the wifi and all the others over wired, when both wifi and wired connected.\nAnd only for this location by the way (so probably a batch to undo it and redo it).\nUsing ubuntu 14.04 desktop (on laptop).\n\nA: Problem can be solved with adding extra routes based on destination.\nFrom terminal\nsudo ip route add ip_address_mail_server dev wlan0\n\nThis can be done by editing connection in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/connection_name\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/connection_name\n\n\n[connection]\nid=Auto XXXX\nuuid=f4a27a71-202f-45ac-bc58-59a55600f515\ntype=802-11-wireless\n\n[802-11-wireless]\nssid=XXXX\nmode=infrastructure\nmac-address=18:CF:5E:23:2A:0A\nsecurity=802-11-wireless-security\n\n[802-11-wireless-security]\nkey-mgmt=wpa-psk\nauth-alg=open\npsk=yyyyyyyyy\n\n[ipv4]\nmethod=auto\nroutes1=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;32;yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy;0;\n\n[ipv6]\nmethod=auto\n\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - represent ip address of mail server\nyyy.yyy.yyy.yyy - represent gateway foe wlan0 interface\nEdit 1\nSecond method is more precise but also more complicated\nLet’s start from the iptable. Here we shall take smtp as the service for routing. Use mangle table of iptable for modifying the smtp packets. \n  sudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -p tcp –dport 993 -j MARK –set-mark 0×1\n\nWe are marking all packets with destination port 993 as ’0×1′ .\nNow save and restart iptables.\nservice iptables save\nservice iptables restart\n\nTo delete this entry from iptables we can use -D instead of -A.\nNext, create a new IP route table in /etc/iproute2/rt_table by just giving an entry\n100 smtp\n\nWrite rule for smtp packets.\nip rule add fwmark 0×1 lookup smtp\n\nAdd route at new table smtp. Here we shall use ’192.168.1.1′ as the gateway for smtp. All other traffic will go through the\ndefault gateway, which can be seen by IP route show command.\nWe copy all entries except default gateway entry from main table.\n sudo ip route show table main | grep -Ev ^default | while read ROUTE ; do ip route add table sshtable $ROUTE; done\n\nAdd default gateway entry for smtp packets to table smtp \n  sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 table smtp\n\nUse ip route show table smtp to show all routes atsmtp`.\nThat’s it..we have done it!!!\nRepeat everything for imap on port 465.\n\nA: first, Make sure you have the iproute package installed. If you have the ip command then you're set \nEdit /etc/iproute2/rt_tables and add a new table by appending the following line:\n200 wlan-route\n\nYou then need to configure your new routing table named wlan-route with a default gateway and create rules to conditionally send traffic to that table. I'll assume your default gateway is 192.168.0.1. Naturally this needs to match your actual network, and not just my assumptions.\nip route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 table wlan-route\nip rule add fwmark 0x1 table wlan-route\n\nYour final annotated script would look like this:\n# Populate secondary routing table\nip route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 table wlan-route\n# Anything with this fwmark will use the secondary routing table\nip rule add fwmark 0x1 table wlan-route\n# Mark these packets so that iproute can route it through wlan-route\niptables -A OUTPUT -t mangle -o eth1 -p tcp --dport 993 -j MARK --set-mark 1\n# now rewrite the src-addr\niptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o wlan0 -p tcp --dport 993 -j SNAT --to 192.168.0.2\n\nthis script sends any traffic on port 993 via wlan0\nsource\n", "Q: Executing a bash script in the terminal just by its name I am trying to follow this example in the Bash Guide over here where one can run a script just by its name instead of bash scriptname.

Notice the -rw-rw-r-- line in the line about mybashscript~. These characters show the permissions level for the file. Right now you have it so that nothing can execute the file, only read or write it.\nAn easy fix is chmod 775 ./mybashscript. This will change those characters to -rwxrwxr-x. The added x's mean that anyone can also execute the code, and will allow you to run your code.\nIf you are concerned that anyone can execute your code, which is a good thing if you are a security minded person or on a shared computer etc. You should look at this webpage that talks about what the different file permissions mean.

It's not always needed but I prefer it as it gets me in the habit of giving the system unambivalent instructions.\nNote: You will probably need to do this via a livecd:\nAs per http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reset-your-ubuntu-password-easily-from-the-live-cd/?PageSpeed=noscript, boot up your livecd, open a terminal and enter the following:\nfdisk -l\n\nThis will show you which hard drive you are using, typically /dev/sda1.\nThen type the following, replacing sda1 with whatever your drive is:\nsudo mkdir /media/sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1\nsudo chroot /media/sda1\n\nThis mounts your hard drive to the livecd and puts you in chroot.

So I want to set a fallback font to be used when some symbols are missing.\nAFAIK, it's related to fontconfig and fonts.conf files. Here is my current fonts.conf file:\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n    <alias>\n        <family>sans</family>\n        <prefer>\n                <family>FONTNAME</family>\n        </prefer>\n    </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nwhere FONTNAME is the font which have all symbols. It works, but after setting this, the default font disappeared and whole system use FONTNAME as default sans font. (Note that, FONTNAME has latin characters too.)\n\nA: It will be easier to install the Ubuntu package for your needed characters if available: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/fonts/\nOtherwise, to answer your question, the first font with a matching character/glyph in the preferred list is the font used. If you don't want FONTNAME used as the default everywhere, then you need to add it to the list after the primary. This should work:\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n    <alias>\n        <family>sans-serif</family>\n        <prefer>\n                <family>ORIGINAL_SANS_FONT</family>\n                <family>YOUR_FONT</family>\n        </prefer>\n    </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nI suggest using: sans-serif instead of sans, because it is the actual name in the fontconfig. sans is an alias.\n\nA: Per this answer you can simply find and download a TTF file (example) that contains the glyphs that you need. Double-click to open the font file in the font viewer, and then click the install button.\nYou don't need to manually set any config up - the system will automatically fall back to your font if the default font is missing glyphs that your new font contains.\n", "Q: Install Microsoft Office Proofing tools under Wine Due to compatibility issues I had to ditch openoffice and libreoffice for Microsoft Office.

This especially applies if the video you are recording is to be used for something other than, say, Skype chatting.\nTypically speaking, if your camera is supported in Cheese, it will be supported in GUVCView.\nSo uninstall Cheese and install GUVCView.\nTo install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/apps\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install guvcview\n\nYou can find GUVCView in the Applications > Sound & Video menu.\nThe latest git development revision can be checkout with the following command:\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/guvcview/git-master guvcview \n\nFor changes in the version of GUVCView see here\nRegarding Compilation.\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\nUsage\nThe following information is from this article\n\nThe basic usage of GUVCView is simple. When opened you will see two different windows. Figure shows the two different windows used by GUVCView. The left window is the preview window that will show a real-time viewer as you record your video (or take your picture). The right window is where you control the video and set up the options for the recording.\nIf you notice your camera is not auto-detected, you will want to go to the Video & Files tab and then see if your device is listed in the Device tab. If it is, but is not selected, go ahead and select it. If it is not listed, the camera might not be supported (or the drivers installed).\nIn this same tab you can select various options for your video recording. One very important option is the resolution. Remember, the higher the resolution the better the quality but the larger the file size.\nDo the same for audio in the Audio tab. You might have to select a different Input device (depending upon the camera you have).\nOnce you have all of your options set up you are ready to record. To do this just make sure you are within the frame of the camera lense and hit the Cap. Video button in the control window. As soon as you click the Cap. Video button, you are recording. When you click the Cap. Video button it will change to Stop Video. To stop recording click the Stop Video button and the file will automatically be saved.\n\n", "Q: Why do I need the x permission to cd into a directory? ls -la prints the following:\ndrwxrwxrw- 2 www-data www-data 4096 Aug 12 11:04 files\n\nMy username does not belong to www-data. When trying to cd into files I get a \"permission denied\" though the \"read\" permission for others is set. \nWhy do I need the \"execute\" permission? \n\nA: The meaning of execute permission for a directory is the ability to look up file names inside that directory. \nWithout execute permission on the directory, you can't stat, open, rename, delete, or descend into subdirectories inside that directory. \nThe only thing you can do is see the list of which filenames exist, and then only if you have read permission (and read but not execute is a strange set of permissions to have for a directory).\nIf you are not owner of the given directory, become a owner by using,\nsudo chown username /path/to/directory\n\nOr better way is to add user to a group,\nsudo usermod -a -G groupName userName\n\nfor getting execute permission use,\nsudo chmod a+x /path/to/dir\n\n", "Q: How to run more then one program through a service (/etc/init/*.conf) file My service, an executable called /opt/mcp/rpe, requires that a second executable is also running, called /opt/mcp/McpVp.\nIn my conf file: /etc/init/mcp.conf I have:\ndescription \"Run MCP\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nscript\n        # Start the RPE application\n        /opt/mcp/rpe -d f -c /opt/mcp\n        # Start the McpVp application\n        /opt/mcp/McpVp &> /var/tmp/mcp.log\nend script\n\nWhen I run this using: sudo start mcp I see that the rpe executable starts but the McpVp does not.\nI also try to run both in background mode, this also does not seem to work, and what is worse, when I try to stop the script it can't find the \"instance\" - I guess because it is lost in the background.\nSo, is there a way to run 2 (or more) processes, such that it works with the start and stop command? (i.e. sudo start mcp and sudo stop mcp)\nI know there are other ways to resolve this issue, but I specifically want to know if I can do this using the .conf file.\n\nA: What you do relatively easily is split the config into 2 configs of one executable with a\ndependency between them.  Then when you start mcp, it automatically starts mcp2 as well, and when you stop mcp, it stops mcp2 as well.  Here's the files:\n#----/etc/init/mcp.conf\ndescription \"Run MCP\"\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n# Start the RPE application\nexec /opt/mcp/rpe -d f -c /opt/mcp\n\nand\n#----/etc/init/mcp2.conf\ndescription \"Run MCP 2\"\nstart on starting mcp\nstop on stopped mcp\n# Start the McpVp application\nexec /opt/mcp/McpVp &> /var/tmp/mcp.log\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth: no adapters found I'm using a Bluetooth keyboard and all was working fine, until today.

Everything worked just fine as I was able to boot from the external hard drive and use ubuntu, and when I unplugged the hard drive from the computer it couldn't boot of course.\nThe problem is, when I plug the hard drive to another computer, and I have tried 3 different computers, they won't boot from it even when I change the boot order correctly in the BIOS, or I get a \"no operating system\" error.\nI would really appreciate any help.\nThank you !\n\nA: for a generic question like yours you can simply reinstall grub on your HDD.\nuse a Ubuntu Live CD or USB, plug your hard drive and open a terminal. Mount the partition where you installed Ubuntu, for example, if the hard drive is on sdb:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\nafter that, do a simply reinstall grub on the MBR's hard drive:\nsudo grub-install –root-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdb\n\n\nA: What I ended up doing is using \"Something Else\" option while re-installing ubuntu on the hard drive, (from a live CD or installation disk) and specifying the boot manager location to be sdX (the external hard drive itself).\nI guess that by installing ubuntu with express partitioning settings the boot manager was either placed on the wrong disk or on one of the disk's partitions.

Since about one month, I experience multiple System program problem detected when I start a session in Ubuntu.  I didn't notice any further problems so I could work with the system without any trouble.  \nAt first, I reported the problem, which means I had to type 12 types my password (one time for each 'crash').  Sometimes I did not have time or courage to do it.  I thought this would be solved with the next upgrade of Ubuntu (I am running Ubuntu 14.04) but so far, nothing happened.\nSo I tried to fix it and discovered a package called xdiagnose already installed on my system. I tried various options there, without success until I disabled apport. Since then, those messages do not show up anymore.  This is much more comfortable so far but are there any drawbacks? How can I know when to resume 'normal operations'?\n\nA: \nSometimes I did not have time or courage to do it\n\nOnce is enough. All the other reports will error out with a message that this case is already registered (that is if it is the same error). \n\nI thought this would be solved with the next upgrade of Ubuntu \n\nOften that is the case. But bugs also can be marked as invalid, or as won't fix, or as unclear. \n\nHow can I know when to resume 'normal operations'?\n\nThose reports end up on the bug pages on Launchpad so track down the bug and see if there is any progress on it. For a more detailed answer you probably need to include an error report into the question (that will probably tell you the package against it is filed and the bug id you need).\n\nIs it safe to turn off apport reporting in xdiagnose?\n\nYes, it is safe!

There is a .deb package in a repository which is declared to be 32bit, but installs 64bit binaries. This is the case for both installing through apt-get from the repository as well as with downloading the .deb file and running dpkg -i.\nIf I install the file to try, it upgrades/overwrites my existing application in 32bit, and I can't run it any more (on 15.04 32bit Ubuntu). When this happened first, I searched the installed executable with which and checked it's type with file, that proved it to be a 64bit ELF binary:\n$ file qtox\nqtox: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped\n\nSo while I wait for the maintainers to fix the issue, how can I determine which architecture a package (from repository or .deb file) contains?\nI tried both apt-cache show and apt-cache policy for the repository version and dpkg -I for the .deb file, but all of them report 32bit, which is wrong. \nIs there any chance to find the real architecture the contained executables are made for out, except by accessing the package's meta information (I think this is what the commands I tried did?) which does obviously not fit.\n\nA: Create a script, in my example foo\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Create a temporary folder in /tmp\ndir=$(mktemp -d)\n\n# Extract the deb file\ndpkg -x \"$1\" \"$dir\"\n\nprintf \"\\n%s\\n\\n\" \"$1\"\n\n# Show the package architecture information\ndpkg --info $1 | \\\n    awk '/Architecture/ {printf \"defined dpkg architecture is:\\t%s\\n\", $2}'\n\n# Show the executable format via find and awk for ELF\nfind $dir -type f -exec file -b {} \\; | \\\n        sort -u | \\\n        awk '/ELF/ {printf \"executable format is: \\t\\t%s\\n\", $0}'\n\nrm -rf \"$dir\"\n\nexit 0\n\n\nUsage\n./foo <deb_file>\n\n\nExample\n% ./foo qtox_1.1\\~git20150707.cfeeb03-97_i386.deb\n\nqtox_1.1~git20150707.cfeeb03-97_i386.deb\n\ndefined dpkg architecture is:   i386\nexecutable format is :          ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped\n\n\nA: A DEB package is just an archive with very specific contents. You can open it in any archive manager you like (such as File Roller or whatever) and the contents are laid out as if you empty it into /. All you need to do is locate a binary and query its file type. This isn't usually necessary - if the filename has i386 in it, it should be i386. Your case is definitely abnormal, so I'm wondering how the package maintainers let that happen.\n\nA: Each deb package declares an architecture, eg. \"i386\" or \"all\". However this is only a declaration, and it can be declared wrong (intentionally for some reason, or eg. by error in some package building script).\nWhat can you about to verify the real package architecture:\n# verify, if package supports multiple architectures (and possibly has some bug):\ndpkg --print-foreign-architectures package.deb\n\n# unpack and check executables inside:\ndpkg --unpack package.deb\ndpkg --contents package.deb |grep ^-rwxr-xr-x |awk \"{ print \\$6 }\" |grep -v /etc/\n\n# and then check a few random unpacked executables using:\nfile ./usr/bin/some-executable\n\n", "Q: Steam download speed drops off a cliff and then stops The basic problem: When updating a game through Steam, I get an initial spike of network activity, then the download stops.\nAs displayed by Steam, the speed tapers off:\n\nWhen looking at the actual network traffic, it spikes once, and then dies entirely:\n\nSome notes here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the download is down to 0, it stays at 0.

Put it inside a box under lock and key\nFor this kind of use it is best not to use Ubuntu Desktop. Use the Ubuntu server version, that has no desktop. Setup the WiFi hotspot as a service. A service (also called a daemon) starts when the computer starts and does not need anyone to log on. See How to setup an access point mode WiFi hotspot? for how to use hostapd to setup WiFi hotspot as a service.\nUse strong password for admin (sudo) accounts. \nIf you can't do that, try WiFi hotspot available to all users. See:\n\nNote, All users may connect to this network box is checked. This means this network will be online before anyone logs on.

Simple.\nIn Ubuntu, I've seen 3 types.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps I download from USC.\n\n*Apps I get through the Terminal. \n\n*\"Portable\" apps I download through my browser.\n\n\nWhat is the difference ? \nIs there a way to have all my apps in one manager as in Windows ?\n\nA: \nIn Windows apps come in .exe type. Simple.\n\nLet me draw a small analogy to Windows. .exe files are binary files and there's .bat scripts under windows. Same thing exists in *nix systems, however,Linux/Unix does not necessarily rely on extensions to define executable files. You might occasionally find .run scripts from proprietary software wendors, but under the hood they are really text files. Mostly, extensions are the choice of the developer. For instance, I add .sh extension for shell scripts , but they are not a requirement - just my own preference. Because I compile C programs with gcc compiler, by default the binary file comes out with .out extensions, but if I wanted to I could save it without one. \nFor instance , if you run  ls -l $(which gnome-terminal) command in terminal (where which command finds gnome-terminal and then ls lists its properties ), you will see this:                                                \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3511 Apr  8 10:34 /usr/bin/gnome-terminal*\nNo extension, but the file itself is executable. More so , if we try to determine what type of file is that, we find something interesting:\n$ file $(which gnome-terminal)\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal: Python script, ASCII text executable\n\nIt's a script ! It's a text file that you can view ! \nBut there's another file , that is being called in the script above /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.real . What does file tell us ?\n$ file /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.real\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal.real: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=3ad9f22b9c39e314bc13cdd74f5917711986ca4d, stripped\n\nSo the python script actually sets up environment for the actual executable.\nNotice  the -rwxr-xr-x part in the output of `ls $(which gnome-terminal). See the rwx ? That's read-write-execute permissions for owner, read-execute for ower's group and other users (read left to right).  If we remove those x permissions for the group and other users , the app is still a working app, but nobody but its owner (root user) will be able to execute it. It may be analogous to Local Group Policy in Windows\nAs for software from USC and terminal (I'm assuming you use apt-get ), they are pretty much the same, mostly binary files. Portable Apps, such as plugins and addons for firefox, are most likely in javascript. But I am not knowledgeable enough of those, so I won't tell for sure. \n\nIs there a way to have all my apps in one manager as in Windows ?\n\nTechnically, you already have one manager for programs under Linux - they're called package managers, e.g. apt-get, yum . With windows you install exe files you download from the web, right ? With Linux you can do that, but more commonly it is done through ppa repositories. apt-get has a list of sources out there on the web. When you install something, like sudo apt-get install someprog , we check those sources, and if the program exists, apt-get downloads it, as well as required libraries and programs, and gives them to dpkg, which install them . Ubuntu Software Centre does same thing, in fact , it is using apt-get behind the scenes.   But apt-get is Ubuntu thing. If you look at Red Hat or Fedora, they use yum. Same idea - use repositories to search and install software. \n\nA: In Linux, the executability (what you would probably call \"appiness\") of any particular file is NOT encoded in the filename (.exe), but rather in the file permission bits. Please learn more about Linux.   \nIf you restrict yourself to applications installed using the Debian/Ubuntu package management system (e.g. dpkg,apt-get,synaptic are tools using it), then the same set of tools can list what you have installed using the tools. If, however, you download something from evil.example.org and install it (or, following included instructions, do sudo anything) you are on your own. You will have to keep track of those things yourself.  \nThere are tools that will let you monitor things like the addition of executables to directories in your $PATH, like Bastille-Linux read this\nbut also read this or Lynis here, but they seem out-of-scope for this answer.\n\nA: In Ubuntu (and basically every other flavor of Linux), most software is installed through software repositories, which is just some unified place from which you can download software. Ubuntu pulls software packages from a number of repositories by default, but you can also add or remove repositories manually from the terminal or the System Settings program. Anytime you run sudo apt-get install <package name>, you are downloading and installing from a repository. Same story if you download from the Ubuntu Software Center, which I think of as a graphical representation of the Ubuntu's repositories, although I'm sure it's different in some regards. Both of those come with a number of benefits, particularly safer software that is reviewed before publishing, and updates delivered directly with all your other software updates. In other words, using the USC or apt-get in the terminal really isn't that different.\nBut not all software is available from a software repository. Or sometimes it's just easier to download a file and install it that way. I think of a .deb as the closest thing to an .exe installer in Ubuntu. But it's a little bit different. A .deb will open the USC for installation, and, at least in some cases, reference a software repository so it will also be updated with all your other software. Google Chrome is a perfect example of this.\nUnfortunately, not all software is available with a Debian-friendly .deb installer or in a software repository. These are frequently available as a .tar.gz, which is just a compressed folder format. These require the user to compile the source code manually from the terminal, using make if I recall correctly. I haven't installed many, if any, programs using this method, so I don't know a whole lot about it, but I wouldn't expect them to update through the software updater.\nAs far as organizing your apps, all your programs should show up in the Unity Dash (activated by the \"Super\" key, which probably has a Windows logo on it). As such, any program can be pinned to the Launcher, or the dock. However, as far as a comprehensive list with a nice, friendly \"uninstall\" button, I don't know of any way of unifying the software you've installed from all these different sources under one roof. The USC has an \"Installed\" tab from which you can view all your installed software, sorted by repositories listed in the drop-down menu. But any software you've compiled yourself will most likely be absent from that list.\nI hope this explanation was helpful. I also hope I'm not filling your head with misinformation, so all you Linux gurus out there, please correct me if I am mistaken when it comes to any of this stuff.\n", "Q: AC adapter triggers calculator When the AC adapter is connected or disconnected the calculator key is being triggered too.

However, I didn't have a wireless card (and no ethernet either), so I got a wireless USB (netis ac1200 wireless dual band usb adapter). It came with a CD with drivers for Linux but I have no idea how to install them! Yes, it has a readme and a PDF for install instructions. I read through them and tried to follow the directions but I keep getting errors when I try to install with the terminal. \nThe install.sh file on the CD is supposed to be what I can use to easily install the drivers. However when I right-click the file on the CD and try to set the permissions to run it as a file it doesn't allow me to do that. \nMeanwhile, if I move the install.sh file to the Desktop and allow it to run as a program and then try sudo ./install.sh I get a bunch of errors when trying to run it (it can't find the Makefile, etc.). \nAny suggestions before I go any further?\nI really don't want to have to go back to Windows but this is getting very frustrating! Two weeks I've been struggling with this install of drivers.\n\nA: You probably can't. As you've already seen, the install.sh can't be made executable on the CD as it is a read-only medium. You need read-write-execute. \nNext, the install.sh needs other files that are in the folder with the install.sh, so you'd need to drag and drop the entire folder to any convenient place, your desktop, for example.\nEven when you do this, the install.sh actually compiles source code. Compiling requires linux-headers which are included in recent Ubuntu versions but not some older versions. You also need a package called build-essential which is a meta package of other packages. \nFinally, many of the driver discs are too old to be useful; that is, they were built for kernel version 2.8 or some such, and will not compile on kernel versions 3.xx and 4.xx.\nI suggest you identify the device from the command:\nlsusb\n\nPost the result and let's see if we can help you.\n\nA: The easiest thing to do would be to just leave the script in the folder on the CD, as it most likely references other files relative to its location, then navigate to it using cd and run it from the terminal. (Keep in mind that external drives in Linux aren't mounted as D: and E: like Windows, but rather a folder, such as /media//. You'll probably want to figure out its mount point from the GUI and then navigate to it in the terminal.) I've always had trouble running .sh scripts from the GUI, so I'd stick with the terminal. If there's a .deb, you can probably run that from the GUI, but since it includes a .sh file, you'll probably want to try that first.\n", "Q: Wifi speed is horrible all of the sudden- Ubuntu 14.04 I don't know what happened but all of the sudden (about two days ago) my wifi is absolutely horrible.

The solution that I posted has something of a major flaw: it's not that it's wrong, it just isn't a permanent fix. In order to make the changes permanent, you actually have to edit your GRUB file.

Then, highlight the Ubuntu option. There should be an option at the bottom of the grub screen to edit commands before booting (mine has 'e' as the hot-button).\nOnce you hit the command edit hot-button, you should see a block of boot commands. Keep in mind that you will have separate boot commands for every boot option.\nCaution: all of the information I'm sending you is stuff I've figured out through tinkering with my computer, and I am by NO means a Linux expert.

It works, but in order to make the changes permanent, you'll have to go into your grub.cfg file in your boot/grub folder and make the same changes in the file. It's read-only if you just try to open it, so you'll have to use this command in your terminal to access the file without restrictions: sudo gedit ... Once you open gedit, you'll have to browse for grub.cfg. Unfortunately I don't know how to open files directly from the terminal (although I'm certain there's a way to do it).\n\n", "Q: Need help getting and intalling zlib1g-dev on Ubuntu 14.04.

I'm trying to strategize my ubuntu installation. I've always read that separating the /home directory makes it easier when it comes to upgrading your distro. But could somebody please explain why? I'm trying to determine if it would be worth it. Thanks! \n\nA: The main reason used to be so that you can format / and not format /home. Nowadays it does not matter any more: the installer lets you keep your /home.\nThere are still a few good reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*if / gets full over something like 95% the filesystem starts to store parts of files not together (ie. defragmentation) so performance will take a small hit.\nWhen / is 100% full you will have a harder time logging it due to the system not being able to use the free space effectively.\nSo a separate /home where you store your personal data will keep your / as empty as possible unless you have a server (apache, mailserver and mysql store their userdata by default in /var). \n\n*A separate /home also allows for encryption of just that partition. \n\n*If /home is on an actual different hard disc you can pull it out and put into another system that holds a / and use that.\n\n\n\nIn that respect depending on your needs and what your system is used for it might be better to create a separate /data partition, have /var/www/html symlink to /data/var/www/html so your websites are on the data disk, change the default database location for mysql to point to /data/var/mysql/ and symlink your /home/$USER/ directories (aka. Desktop, etc). to /data/home/{dirs}.\nIf /data is an actual disk you could take it out of your system, place it into an upgraded Ubuntu and continue working on it. Besides maybe a little snag here and there (like settings that got removed from mysql or apache) you could have a new system with all your data up and running in a single reboot and the time it takes to insert the disk into that new machine.\nI do that a lot with my notebooks.\n\nA: There is no need to have a separate /home partition for general use on a desktop system.\nThis is a kind of \"tradition\" to have it as a separate partition. There is almost no difference when you re-install.\nThe reasons to have it separate are, but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having an encrypted Home.\n\n*Using LVM.\n\n*Having a different file system, like XFS for Home.\nThere may be other reasons that I cannot recall right now. \nBut if you already have installed with /home on the same partition as /, it is not worth the effort to change it anyway.\nDisadvantage of having it separate is that you will always have to waste some space on your /.\nBut as a bottom line I can say that there is almost no difference.\n", "Q: Password manager does not trigger with Chromium when it should I'm running into inconvenience because the global password manager (gnome keyring?) that should fill in auth dialogs in Chromium doesn't trigger. For example, I'm accessing some webpage that asks for basic HTTP auth, or simply a login form I've already accessed and for which Chromium has already stored my credentials.\nThe expected flow would be \n\n\n*\n\n*the global pw manager popping up once per session, the first time I load the page (or periodically in a session, like sudo works, for example), \n\n*demanding my password, \n\n*then filling in the browser auth dialog. \n\n\nInstead, nothing happens, unless I sidestep this by doing some other action that finally triggers the password manager, e.g. installing-uninstalling some program in Ubuntu's software center. After triggering the password dialog in this manner, and refreshing the relevant pages in Chromium, passwords and credentials are filled in as expected, but this is far from ideal. I cannot find links to other people experiencing this problem. Does anybody know how to solve this?\nIt seems I'm running into a similar issue as the one detailed in this SU question. In my case, both \"Enable Autofill...\" and \"Offer to save passwords...\" are checked. When I first login (autologin is enabled), e.g. when turning on the computer, the Saved Passwords list is empty. After doing something that requests the global password manager's attention, such as the aforementioned installing something through the Software Center, the list is full of stored credentials.\nI checked, and it doesn't seem to be a difference between starting a session with automatic login (where I don't have to input my password) or starting my session by entering a password (I tried closing the session, the system then asked me for my password, but autofill was still unavailable.)\nI checked Seahorse, and I see two different password keyrings: the \"Session Start\" one, which only contains one item: \"Unlock password for Default (Google Chrome password)\" and the \"Predeterminado\" keyring, which indeed holds all my Google Chrome passwords, and probably more. Problem is, the \"Default\" keyring is not unlocked by logging in.\nI also tried replacing the \"login\" keyring with the \"Predeterminado\" (Spanish for \"Default\") one, as mentioned in this answer, but that didn't work either, and in fact that made the chromium password autofill stop working entirely.\n\nA: You mix up two separate issues.\nGnome-keyring stores passwords for websites and other passwords, like ssh, gpg, etc.\nThe keyring is unlocked when you login into the system and does not require to enter master password again. That is normal behavior.\nWhen you try to install some software, you need to have an administrator privileges. In Ubuntu you do not have to login as root, but sudo lets you execute a privileged task from a user account, but asks to enter a password again.\nThese two scenarios are not related. And this is not a problem at all.\n", "Q: Installing landscape-server > ERROR landscape-setup superuser I installed landscape yesterday without any problems, and then I broke it because I had to change my hostname and a bunch of other configurations on apache.\nI made the mistake of removing the packages trying to do a \"clean install\" using the landscape-server-quickstart and now I'm stuck at the error below.\nI've deleted the landscape group, user, data from postgress, config files, but just can't figure it out. \napt-get install output:\napt-get install landscape-server-quickstart\n\nReading package lists...

A newbie question I'm watching a tutorial on youtube about Zookeeper installation, confuguration and usage. And what I do not understand is how the instructor opens up three different terminal windows with titles like nuggetuser@HNHBMaster:~, nuggetuser@HNHRegion1:~ and nuggetuser@HNHRegion2:~ [14:20].

So, please, explain what this stuff means (I mean those different terminals), so that I could proceed with Zookeeper. Thanks!\nEDIT\nThis is how it looks like:\n\n\nA: nuggetuser@HNHBMaster means that the username is nuggetuser and the host name of that computer is HNHBMaster.\nIf the other terminals show other hostnames it means that the user has logged onto another computer (most likely using ssh).\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu on win 10 PC I want to install ubuntu on PC already running windows 10. I downloaded linux and made a bootable USB drive but on startup the system directly boots win 10.\nAlso i dont get option for selecting my boot device.\nWhat is the way forward ?\n\nA: I had this problem on a new Asus laptop.\nIt came with win 8.1 which I immediately upgraded to Windows 10.\nThe usual method of getting in to BIOS no longer works. The F2 key is ignored during boot.\nAfter some investigation I discovered that by telling Windows 10 you are in a rescue situation. It will fix it so you can get into the BIOS for one boot only.  However, when you get into the BIOS you find that the boot options have been restricted. So that you can only select a partition on the main drive (in this case an SDD).\nSo Windows 10 does allow you to boot from the rescue partition but not from USB drive.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working on Zoostorm laptop Trying to get my laptop to connect with my Samsung S3 and/or an A2DP receiver over bluetooth.

If so, it's a problem with your mouse/mouse drivers. If it does work on another browser, It's a problem with Mozilla.
