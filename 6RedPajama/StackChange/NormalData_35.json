["Q: iOS apps for sync data via sftp Please give me advice with iOS apps for data sync via sftp. I've tried using google... But there is no result.\nI need to sync iOS 8.1 with debian via sftp in live mode.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you meant with \"sync via sftp\", but if you just need an ftp client, you could use Transmit, that is available for iPhone and iPad and support the following protocols:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP\n\n*FTP with TLS/SSL\n\n*FTP with implicit TLS/SSL\n\n*SFTP\n\n*WebDAV\n\n*WebDAV HTTPS\n\n*Amazon S3\n\n*DreamObjects\n\n", "Q: folder copy in Finder labels it as incomplete, though copying is completed I am getting this error much too often.

The reasons behind this are unclear, but I know it's not to do with user-level software preferences, nor directly to with a low-level hardware problem (see my original question on superuser for the full troubleshooting logic).\nI should note that it's a made-for-Windows keyboard: a Thinkpad USB Keyboard with Trackpoint, in fact—the trackpoint being the reason I like it so much and stick with it despite its problems. So the key I'm that I'm mapping to option in the System Preferences is in fact the \"Windows Logo\" key.\nIt does work if I use option + RIGHT-shift + right-arrow but this is a very clumsy hand position for moving quickly around my documents.  So I'd like to try swapping the Mac's interpretation of the left and right shift keys. Is this possible, and if so, how?\n\nUpdate:\nAt the suggestion of Tetsujin\nI tried Karabiner but it seems like the problem is happening at a lower level.  The keyboard event for right-arrow never even reaches Karabiner if the Windows-logo and (physical) left-shift keys are held down (and it doesn't matter whether Windows logo is mapped to another modifier: the problem is stuck to that specific physical key combo).\nIn response to the comment by  Insomniac Software\nhere's what the Karabiner EventViewer says when I press:\nWindows-logo + left-shift + left-arrow:\neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x38       name:Shift_L         flags:Shift Opt                          misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_L   characters:    \neventType:keyDown         code:0x7b       name:Left            flags:Shift Opt NumPad Fn                misc:KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT   characters:    \neventType:keyUp           code:0x7b       name:Left            flags:Shift Opt NumPad Fn                misc:KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT   characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x38       name:Shift_L         flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_L   characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:                                   misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \n\nWindows-logo + left-shift + right-arrow:\neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x38       name:Shift_L         flags:Shift Opt                          misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_L   characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x38       name:Shift_L         flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_L   characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:                                   misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \n\nWindows-logo + right-shift + right-arrow:\neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x3c       name:Shift_R         flags:Shift Opt                          misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_R   characters:    \neventType:keyDown         code:0x7c       name:Right           flags:Shift Opt NumPad Fn                misc:KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT  characters:    \neventType:keyUp           code:0x7c       name:Right           flags:Shift Opt NumPad Fn                misc:KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT  characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x3c       name:Shift_R         flags:Opt                                misc:KeyCode::SHIFT_R   characters:    \neventType:keyMod          code:0x3a       name:Option_L        flags:                                   misc:KeyCode::OPTION_L  characters:    \n\n(NB: windows-logo + right-shift + left-arrow also works, in case you were wondering).\nNote that in the specific case of windows-logo + left-shift + right-arrow Karabiner sees fewer events in the first place.

I don't know any way to fix that, unfortunately, but I thought I'd answer the original question anyway.\nYou can remap modifier keys in OS X from at least 10.4 through to 10.10.4 by changing a Property List (.plist) file. The file is located within ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost, and is named .GlobalPreferences.[a long identifier].plist, where each user's long identifier varies. (In the Terminal, you can just use Tab-completion to pick up the specific name of your file.)\nHere are the steps to copy, convert, edit, and replace the .plist:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences > Keyboard, click \"Modifier Keys\" and remap at least one of the buttons (e.g. Caps Lock > Control). This will ensure that the proper section exists in the .plist, and make it easier to find.\n\n*In Terminal, go to or create a directory where you'll do the work, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*cp ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences (then press Tab to autocomplete the unique filename)\n\n*plutil -convert xml1 -o ./keys-xml.plist ./keys-binary.plist\n\n\n*Open the converted XML file. (You can use open /Applications/TextEdit.app keys-xml.plist to launch TextEdit from the Terminal.)\n\n*Locate the section in the file called \"com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping...\". You should see at least one \"dict\" group within that section. It will actually be one entry per specific key that's been remapped, so if you remapped Control to Shift, you'd see entries remapping LeftControl to LeftShift and RightControl to RightShift.\n\n*Modify the existing entry using the table below, changing the HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc key value to the Source key (the physical button you'll press, and the HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst key value to the Destination key you want (the key you want to take effect).\n\n*Copy the entire dict section (from <dict> to </dict>, including the key mappings, and paste one per key you want to remap, changing the Src and Dst for each.\n\n*Save and close the file. Then, back in Terminal:\n\n\n\n*plutil -convert binary1 -o ./keys-binary_new.plist keys-xml.plist\n\n*cp ./keys-binary_new.plist ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences (then Tab to autocomplete)\n\n\n*Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.\n\n\nHere are the key values to use for each modifier key in the Src/Dst mapping:\n+-----------------+-----------+\n|    Key Name     | Key Value |\n+-----------------+-----------+\n| None            |        -1 |\n| Caps Lock       |         0 |\n| Shift (Left)    |         1 |\n| Control (Left)  |         2 |\n| Option (Left)   |         3 |\n| Command (Left)  |         4 |\n| Keypad 0        |         5 |\n| Help            |         6 |\n| Shift (Right)   |         9 |\n| Control (Right) |        10 |\n| Option (Right)  |        11 |\n| Command (Right) |        12 |\n| ~~Kernel Panic~~|      ~~16~|\n+-----------------+-----------+\n\nNB: Key Code 16 should typically not be used.\nSource: Rewritten from http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060825072451882\n\nA: I ran across this article in my travels and it looks like it might be of some help.  \nRemapping Keyboard Keys Mac OS X Mavericks\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a DAS keyboard that was actually made for my Mac - the left Option key caused a mysterious combination of keys to be pressed, rather than Option.

In our school environment, we have a WPA2 network with simple username/password for joining all our Apple TVs. Eventually we replaced this with hard-wired Ethernet connections. Faculty and staff join another WiFi network which students may not access. This network allows staff to see Apple TV in AirPlay while students may not.\nThe problem is we have incredible inconsistency with some users experiencing periodic disconnects while others are fairly consistent. We checked with a number of other schools experiencing the same problem, and we also checked with two outside networking companies to evaluate our network health. Health is good. Pinging many different end points, we see packet loss is unusual. We have come to the conclusion that the problem is in the Apple TV device, not our network.\nI read that using Apple TVs in this way is in a sense creating a use case for the device as they were never intended to be used in such an environment. I want to find success stories where relatively large schools (1200+ staff and students) have deployed Apple TVs and used them without the problems we are having.\nSome other things we did based on research:\nTurn off sleep mode\nDisable screen saver\nTurn off Bluetooth\nUpgrade to Generation 3 Apple TV\nmajority iPads are 3+ but there are some iPad2\n\nA: We have a similar setup at our school, approx. 1300 students and an Apple TV in every room, most of which are connected to Dell projectors and Promethean interactive whiteboards. Like your setup, our ATVs connect via Ethernet.\nAnd yes, we've had our fair share of teething troubles since adopting Apple equipment in 2012, particularly with dropped connections. Apart from poor IT practise and usage from staff we've had a few network issues that, once identified, have made things much more reliable.\nBefore last summer all our access points were set to dual-band operation, allowing the Macs to select network settings automatically. This worked reasonably well until a Cisco firmware update in the summer when things went downhill. Airport diagnostics indicated the 2.4GHz band was pretty busy so we made the Mac VLAN 5GHz-only. Having all clients connecting on 5GHz has massively reduced the number of dropped connections and reliability overall has significantly improved. Incidentally this have the knock-on effect of killing AirPrint on our Epson Workforce printers so they've had to be wired in.\nOur biggest problem though has come from teaching staff using MS PowerPoint. Prior to 2012 all our staff used Windows and Office for all their needs, and it was deemed necessary to ease the transition to the Apple environment by giving Staff access to Office Mac 2011. I'm no fan of Office but it's what the staff are used to. Our PowerPoint problems come from staff thinking they are saving time by loading up a day's worth of teaching material into PowerPoint, which then frequently crashes and takes AirPlay down with it. Occasionally we can sort AirPlay issues out by cycling the Wi-fi off and on again, but frequently it's more of a case of logging the teacher off and back in again, or restarting OS X in the worst cases. Teachers using Keynote are almost never affected.\nA couple of other things...\nOccasionally (and generally while using PowerPoint) a teacher will try to connect to the ATV in their room but it will randomly connect to a completely different ATV elsewhere in the building. We nailed that by passwording each ATV using the room number as the password.\nWe've also had issues recently with a number of ATVs refusing to wake up automatically when attempting to connect to them. This has come as a result of a software update which failed on those units. They would otherwise work ok but would have to be turned on manually. Restoring the units via Apple Configurator brought them back to full functionality. - Note, this can also be done via iTunes but iTunes doesn't cache the downloaded firmware and so does a fresh download for each unit to be restored. Restoring via Configurator is much quicker as it checks to see if it has already downloaded the firmware.\nHope this gives you some ideas...\n", "Q: Two versions of the same app in Launchpad How can I have two versions of the same app listed in Launchpad?\nFor example, I have both Processing 1.5 and Processing 2.0 installed. Only one shows up at once - is it possible to have both?\n\nA: Yes is possible to have two or more versions from the same application.\nIn order to work, you should rename your apps on Applications folder:\n /Applications/Processing-1.5\n /Applications/Processing-2.0\n\nThe main issue with this, is that usually both apps will share configuration files, and sometimes will be a problem.\n\nA: You can rename them in the Applications folder.\nI guess both appear there as \"Processing\", give different names to them.\n\nA: Simply add the version numbers to the Applications' names in the Applications folder. You can do this by clicking the Application icon, then clicking the title underneath.

Finder isn't shown. Why?\nI use Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)\n\nOn Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) typing \"Finder\" in Spotlight does display the finder app.\n\nA: What are you trying to accomplish? Finder.app is hidden. If you wish to quickly open finder, command-tab is easy. \nIf that's your goal, some of these suggestions may be helpful. Personally I use finder windows accessed via command-tab. I dragged my Downloads directory into the sidebar (it should be there already). So: command-tab to finder, click Downloads in the sidebar and viola. Alternatively, you could drag the downloads folder to the dock (it should be there already). Or, swipe 4 fingers down to reveal desktop (an option in system preferences -> trackpad), then click desktop to select finder.\nIn Automator you could build a workflow and save it as a service. In Automator use open finder and save as a service. This will put it in your Library to be available across applications. Then enable a quick key assigning a keyboard shortcut in system preferences -> keyboard -> keyboard shortcuts -> services.\n\nA: Because Finder is located inside /System/Library. (Specifically, at /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app.) Everything inside any of the Library folders is considered a \"system file\", and not normally visible.\nInterestingly, Yosemite seems to have made an exception for /System/Library/CoreServices, treating it more like an applications folder than a library folder. Spotlight will show Finder in Yosemite.\nIn a Finder search window (which is basically Spotlight with more focus on finding files but little or none on finding non-files), you need to add a [System files][are included] search term to see system files. If you don't see System files as an option in that first menu, select \"Other...\" and find \"System files\". (Note that you can search for it!) For future convenience, put a checkmark on it to add it to the menu.\n", "Q: Which user name do I need to remotely log into my Mac? My username in the Mac login screen (\"My Name\", there is a space) doesn't match the one in Finder and terminal (\"anothername\"). Which one is my real username? The reason I'm asking is that I want to share media files over my home network, and when I was trying to access the media from another computer, it ask me for username and password. I don't know which one is my username I only know the password. I tried both and neither worked. Always says wrong username or password. I'm sure I know my password because that's how I login to my Mac. Could there be a third username? I'm completely lost.\n\nA: Either works. You have a short-name and a long name. Here's a great article about it.\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548\n", "Q: Macbook White Mid 2007 will not boot even on Mac OS X Lion bootup USB I see the gray screen and nothing shows up for minutes on the screen not even the blinking question marked folder. Does anyone know how to get it to boot as I have a new hard drive I installed and want to install Mac OS X Lion via the time machine backup. The old hard drive works fine but the boot up using the USB stick does not work.\n\nA: So I solved this problem by creating the Bootable USB stick by booting into my old hard drive and downloading and installing the recovery disk on the USB stick. Before I made the bootable USB stick on OS X Yosemite.\n", "Q: Would and SSD or RAM be the better upgrade in this situation? I feel I'm making this post more for validation than anything, but I want to get some of your opinions as well.\nMy friend contacted me the other day asking how she could make her MacBook Pro run a bit faster. I had her send me a screenshot of what she has and it's a Mid 2009 MBP with 4GB of RAM. I had her send me a screenshot of activity monitor and it shows she was using 8 MB of swap. In my mind, she is going to see a better performance boost from upgrading to an SSD instead of RAM, here's why:\nHer swap memory is already pretty low. Now, she is running 10.10.1, which is more RAM hungry, but that's the beauty of an SSD. Even if she does need more RAM, her swap will be much more efficient because it's on an SSD. And, when it's not needing it, any read/writes will be exponentially faster than the current 5400 rpm 320 GB drive she has now.\nShe talked to her brother who said to her \"upgrading to an SSD you won't see a difference unless you game.\" Which I then let her know is complete and utter.... you know. So I decided she could upgrade to 6GB of RAM for cheap and then get an SSD all for under $250. She told me that would be her ceiling. \nTonight she told me that because of what her brother said and another friend of hers said she is going to get a 1TB spinning drive and 8GB of RAM but she still wants me to help install it. I think a 1TB is honestly a terrible idea since that will most likely make read/writes slower, but that's just me.\nSo tell me... do you think my logic is faulty? Is more RAM really going to be a huge upgrade for her? Or am I making sense by thinking \"if swap is needed, it's better it be from an SSD than get more ram that you aren't using in the first place?\"\n\nA: Your logic is sound. Just something to keep in mind is that while yes swap is much faster on a SSD, it is still much slower in respect to RAM and both should probably be upgraded. But yes she would see the most improvement by going to a SSD\nJust as a side note 10.10.1 will try to pre-cache as many things as possible in RAM so apple uses 'memory pressure' to reflect the systems demand for RAM.\n", "Q: Macbook Lion Recovery Disk Utilities cannot detect newly installed SSD I just installed the SSD and I cannot detect the SSD in Disk Utilities of the recovery disk. Even trying to restore from time machine backup it cannot find any disk it can restore to. I am restoring Mac OS X Lion backup and using the Lion bootable USB stick.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot into Recovery from the USB.\n\n*Instead of opening Disk Utility, open Terminal instead.\n\n*Run the command diskutil list to see that your drive is being recognised. It should list two disks, one being your bootable drive, the other your SSD, and provide you with a disk identifier (such as disk0). If it doesn't show up, check that you have installed it properly.\n\n*If it is showing up, then type diskutil partitionDisk disk0 GPT JHFS+ MacHD to correctly set the partition map to GPT and create a HFS+ Journaled volume. Change disk0 to the appropriate identifier for your SSD. You can rename the 'MacHD' volume later in Disk Utility or Finder, if you wish.\n\n*Quit Terminal.\n\n\nYou should now be able to pick up the disk in Disk Utility and Time Machine to restore your backup.\n", "Q: How can I change the position of alerts pop up? With Yosemite we got handy, growl-like, alert popups from the notification center. It's great but it often hides handy utils which also take the top right position of the screen.\nIs there any way change the position of those alerts (via system preferences, plist, or an app)?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no built-in way to change the position of the popups still. Problem is well known (for instance, see here: Change location of notification center alerts).\nThe only way you can customize the position of notifications is to use commercial app - Growl (http://growl.info) for those apps that support it or turn all or some notifications off via System Preferences -> Notifications.\n", "Q: MacBook 13\" white (mid 2007) - how to treat a new battery for optimal battery life? The old battery of my MacBook 13\" white (mid 2007) is dead (as I always had the MacBook on my desktop and did not bother calibrating or discharging the battery).\nI bought a new one (original Apple battery) and I wonder how to treat it to get optimal performance and a long life.\nI found general tips on the apple.com homepage, but they are for MacBook Air/Pro Li-Ion batteries, and if I am not mistaken, the MacBook 13\" has a Li-Polymer battery which might be a different story.\nSo what do I do with the new battery?\n\n\n*\n\n*first use/charging\n\n*daily use\n\n\nA: I remember asking the guy at the Apple store this very question back when I bought my black MacBook 13\" back in 2007. From what he said and from what I've read over the years regarding battery health, most of what Apple have stated on the page you referenced is applicable to you. If I could offer some more advice, it would be this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cycle your battery at least once a month by charging it to 100%, discharging it completely (until the MacBook puts itself to sleep) and leaving it discharged for about 5 hours, then charge to 100% again and let it \"over\"-charge for about 2 hours. According to Apple, you should get 300 cycles out of your battery before it is considered to be \"consumed\". That's 300 months of use if you only cycle it that many times.\n\n*Only charge the laptop when you need to. Don't leave it constantly plugged in. If you know you're going to be running off of mains for an extended period without the possibility of power failure, then consider  removing the battery altogether to prolong its life. The 2007 model MacBooks have easily removable batteries so it's not too much of a hassle.\n\n*As for first use, as far back as I can remember, all Apple products are ready to use straight out of the box. It's annoying to get so excited to have a device, get home, and then have to wait 16 hours for it to do an initial charge. As far as I am aware, this should extend to their batteries as well, although I would hazard a guess that the batteries come with a 50% charge instead of a full charge as the batteries should be stored at around 50% for long-term storage. I would suggest, based on that and the above advice, to utilise the battery the first time without an initial charge, deplete it until the MacBook enters low power state, then charge it fully.\n", "Q: How to use gcc or git without installing xcode? I am a newbie of Mac user. I can see there are gcc, git, etc in the \"/usr/bin\" folder. But when I want to use them,  it prompts like this:  \nMacBook-Pro:~ nan$ git\nxcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command   line developer tools.\nMacBook-Pro:~ nan$ gcc\nxcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.\n\nDoes it mean I must install xcode to use gcc or git, thanks very much in advance!\n\nA: You could install both of them using Homebrew:\nbrew install gcc\nbrew install git\n\nTo install homebrew, you just need this single command:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nAnyway, if you want to use git and gcc installed on you system, you don't need to install Xcode, instead you just need to install the command line developer tools, that you can install by typing:\nxcode-select --install\n\n\nA: No you don't, at least not anymore. The possibility mentioned by @jherran involves installing yet another piece of software. If that's ok with you, you can use Hombrew or Macports. Its controversial which one is 'better', so take which one you like.\nBut, since OSX Yosemite (or maybe earlier, not sure), the Command Line Tools can be installed separately, which is great since it allowed me to ditch the huge useless XCode app sitting idly on my hard drive.\nThe most straightforward way might be to simply download the right package from Apple here.\nWhen issuing the commands you mentioned, does a window pop up prompting you to install the Command Line Tools? It is outlined here that this is what should happen. \nOr, just try to run \nxcode-select --install\n\nWhich should do what you want. They can be updated via the App store, at least on Yosemite.\nNote that if the executables are present in /usr/bin, you should be able to call them with their full name, e.g. /usr/bin/git.\n", "Q: Can I add actions to control automator to automator? Is there any way that I can add automator itself to the list of services I can automate? For example right now I can go and add a launch application action to the workflow and within that action launch automator. Effectively this creates a level of control over automator but only by routing it through the utilities action item. I know that you can add new application action libraries to automator to control any app that releases a library for it. So is there one for automator? Where is it if there is?\n\nA: Automator itself does not ship with self referencing Automator actions.\nGUI Scripting\nAlternative approaches include using GUI Scripting to automate interactions with the Automator application. See Accessibility Preferences and GUI Scripting for an example of how to set this up on recent versions of Mac OS X.\nautomator Command Line Tool\nOS X includes an automator command line tool. You can use this tool to incorporate your Automator workflows into other scripts. Through this tool you can pass in variables and thus manipulate the workflow's behaviour.\nBeyond Automator\nYou may find GUI Scripting and the corresponding What Me Do action fragile or unpredictable. If so, consider tools such as Sikuli to help automate your Mac.\n", "Q: iPhone claims diskspace is full My iPhone 5S 16GB is complaining about disk running out of free space.\nWhen I check it in settings, it shows me I have 1,5GB free space.\nWhy do I get this notice? It started since iOS8.\nIs this a bug in iOS?\n\nA: Although your device may show you that you have 1,5GB space available, it is possible that the free space notification is popping up due to application updates requiring a bit more space than that. Try resetting your settings (don't worry, you won't lose any data!) to see if that helps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Settings\" app.\n\n*Tap \"General\".\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and tap \"Reset\"\n\n*Tap \"Reset All Settings\". This will only reset settings to their factory defaults and can often clean out any corrupt preferences that may cause undesirable behaviour. Your data such as contacts, photos, apps etc will not be touched.\n\n*Enter your passcode (if you have one set)\n\n*Confirm that you wish to reset your settings.\n\n\nWhen your device has restarted, check your free space again. It might have increased a little and you should no longer get the notification that you are running out of storage space.\n", "Q: iPhone (iOS) mistakes my router (mifi) as needing a login page When using my iOS 8 iPhone 6 with a cellular mifi, it sometimes thinks this device has some sort of webpage login page, the way public wifi does (I guess sometimes called a landing page).  However, it does not.  Is there a way in iOS I can mark a SSID as never needing a login page?\nI suspect the reason it does this is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The mifi gives out DHCP before it has connected to the internet via cellular\n\n*iOS sees that it has a local IP address but can't reach the interent via some sort of test\n\n*Thus iOS assumes this is a scenario where you have to login, and tries to bring up a landing page - its blank but has the domain name that the router uses a shortcut to get to its web interface\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: When you log into any wifi router, immediately thereafter the OS (iOS or MacOS) tries to resolve the DNS for www.apple.com, and then attempts to navigate to this page:\napple.com/library/test/success.html\n(Or one of a handful of similar ones distributed around the 'net.) The page is very simple and basically just responds with the word \"Success\". If they do not get that, or it times out, they assume that you're on a captive router that needs a login. In that case they navigate to the IP of your router/gateway, which in your case brings up the settings, but in a captive system brings up the login page.\nFixing it seems to be a bit of a dark art. Try this solution first and see if it helps.\n\nA: In Settings → Wi-Fi, when you click the small i next to the network name, you can disable the automatic login setting, then the window should not be shown again.\n", "Q: What font is used for keyboard symbols?

After that, I didn't realize that I lost all my files that were in the hard disk. How can I get the files back?\nMacBook Air\n\nA: First things first, switch off Time Machine. Any further backups to that drive will hamper your ability to recover your files. \nYou're going to need some sort of data recovery app to dig down through your hard drive to recover the data that was there which has hopefully not been overwritten. \nEaseUS is a pretty good recovery program that I have used to recover data in the past. Their Mac version is a little pricey, at $89.95, but you will have to gauge the value of your data you need to recover and see if it works out worth it. \nI doubt you will find any decent free application that can properly recover your data. EaseUS do have a trial version available that will allow you to recover up to 2GB of lost data so you can try it out risk free.\n", "Q: Sign in without credit card if the Apple id is already created I have create my apple Id online using chrome and not from the App store or Itunes.\nNow when i try to download any free app from the app store it gives me a error that the Apple id i am using has never been used before.\nIt takes me to a different page where i have to agree to the agreement and demands the credit card info on the next screen where the \"none\" option is not available.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Log in Apple Store using your AppleID\nSelect Account\nSelect Edit for the Payment type\nSelect None.\n\n\nA: Creation of Apple ID does not mean you've created an App store account, so when creating a App store account one you'll need to setup payment information either using a credit card or a debit card if you're creating an Indian Apple app store account. Payment setup is done to ease the process of buying content/apps later while using the store. The initial setup does not require you to make any payments.\nNone option for payment type is not available for the Indian users. It's been this way for a very long time.

I am having an issue with the AppStore, and this is a related, but different question. \nHow do I find and remove all bits of the AppStore application? Besides the obvious app itself, sitting in the application folder, what prefs, helpers, etc are there that must be removed? \nI ask this because when I removed the application file, deleted it, and reinstalled (from 10.6.6 updater image), the app icon showed a pending update the moment it launched, and it showed that I was signed in to my account. This implies there's more stuff I need to delete. \n\nA: This is very tricky. From 10.6.6 (when Apple released the Mac App Store), the App Store has been pretty deeply built in to the system. You can see this by the fact that if you click on the  in your Menu Bar, there is an option to launch the App Store from there.\nIn later versions of OS X it is even more deeply embedded as software updates for the OS are downloaded through the App Store. In order to completely remove all trace of the App Store and still have a stable system that won't crash or kernel panic, you would have to dig in to some of the Apple Frameworks and binaries to remove references for the App Store.\n", "Q: Extend Netgear CG3100 Router network with Airport Express A1088 I have a Netgear router (CG3100) which is in my office and the base of our wireless network. A few rooms to the back of the apartment we have an Apple TV but the wireless connection here is flaky and keeps dropping out so I want to extend it. \nI found an old AE base station (A1088) which is good and working - I understand though that this can't extend the Netgear wirelessly as you need all Apple products for that, but it can extend the network when connected by Ethernet. \nBeen searching for how to do this but can't find any info.. can anyone point me in the direction of some resources/how-to for this or let me know how to do it?\nCheers!\n\nA: The problem with that model of AirPort Express is that it only supports 802.11b/g and not the much faster 802.11n. Using it with an Apple TV, I doubt you'll have sufficient bandwidth to watch HD content. If that's not a problem for you, then here is how I got my AirPort Express (A1264) to extend my TP-Link connection via Ethernet. I'm assuming you know your Netgear's IP and Subnet for the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect from your current WiFi network.\n\n*Plug in your AirPort Express and connect it via Ethernet to your Mac. If you don't have a Mac, make sure you have AirPort Utility on your Windows computer.\n\n*We want to start with a completely fresh configuration, so use a pen, paperclip, hair pin, whatever to hold in the little grey reset button until the light starts to rapidly flash amber.\n\n*Open AirPort Utility on your computer and select the AirPort Express Base Station, if it doesn't automatically open up the wizard. It may take up to a minute to show up so be patient. Make sure that you are scanning on Ethernet, too.\n\n*AirPort Utility should automatically assume you want to create a new network, so enter your existing SSID (the name of your network) that your Netgear router is using under \"Network Name\".\n\n*You can name the Base Station anything you would like, such as \"My AirPort Express\", or \"Dopey\" or \"Batman\", it really doesn't matter so long as it doesn't share a name with another device on your network.\n\n*Enter an access password to prevent unauthorised users from altering your settings and click \"Next\"\n\n*The AirPort Express will verify your settings and then probably ask you to cycle your modem's power. You can ignore this and just click \"Next\".\n\n*After resetting the Airport Express again, AirPort Utility should now show you your AirPort Express with a blinking amber alert and a few errors. Select it, and select \"Edit\".\n\n*Select the \"Internet\" tab and in the \"Connect Using\" dropdown, select \"Static\". This will allow us to specify the IP and Subnet that we want to use.\n\n*Set the IPv4 Address to something within your current network range (typically 192.168.1.xxx) If your Netgear router is 192.168.1.1, consider using 192.168.1.2, for example. Unless you have an atypical Subnet set, leave the subnet mask field, and fill in the Netgear's IP under \"Router Address\" and \"DNS Servers\".\n\n*Switch to the \"Wireless\" tab and confirm that the \"Wireless Network Name\" is correctly set to the SSID of the Netgear router. Change the \"Wireless Security\" drop-down to reflect the same security that your Netgear uses, and also type in your network password that you use to connect to the Netgear router.\n\n*Click \"Wireless Options\" at the bottom and set your Country. You can leave the Channel set to Automatic here, but if you would prefer, you can set the channel to whatever your Netgear is using, but offset by 3 either way (so if your Netgear uses Channel \"2\", set your AirPort Express to use \"5\"). Click Save.\n\n*Switch to the \"Network\" tab and set \"Router Mode\" to \"Off (Bridge Mode)\". This will allow all traffic to pass through the AirPort to the Netgear router.\n\n*Click \"Update\". You will be notified that the device will be temporarily unavailable. Click \"Continue\".\n\n*Disconnect the Ethernet cable from your computer and connect the AirPort Express to your Netgear router.\n\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you should be able to connect to your usual WiFi network and have the AirPort Express show up under AirPort Utility. From there, you should be able to connect your Apple TV without any problem. If it was connected to the Netgear network, it should automatically join the extended network anyway.\n", "Q: I removed Macintosh HD from backup disk how do I set it back?

For security reasons, wiping the phone is designed to be nearly instantaneous so a thief has no time to intervene.\nYou might have better luck if you turn the phone off and on again before trying again. By \"off\" I don't mean screen sleep. Hold the power button down for several seconds until a \"Swipe to turn off\" slider appears.\n", "Q: Cannot share media file to PC I want to share my media files on my Mac to my home network, however when I tried to access them from my PC I was asked for username and password. I'm sure I entered them correctly (I mean I can log out and log in my Mac no problem), but it kept saying unknown user name or bad password. What could possible cause the issue?\n\n\nA: That is an excellent start but you may still get the same error message as Windows will often want to know the domain of the username (not \"Domain\" with a capital D).\nWhen you log into a PC over the network from another PC your username will often take the form of:\n[PCNAME]\\[USERNAME]\n[PASSWORD]\n\nSo if my pc was called stevespc with a username of steve and a password of 1234:\nstevespc\\steve\n1234\n\nThis is so that the PC will know where to get the authentication information from. If you leave off the [PCNAME] then it will assume that it is using credentials from the computer you are logging in from and not the username and password that you want to get to (with a username/password from the target PC).\nso you may have to add the computer name of the mac. If you can't recall it you can use the IP address as well. Like this:\n192.168.0.1\\steve\n1234\n\nIt's annoying and can be confusing at first but once you learn the trick its no big deal.\n\nA: This can sometimes be a bit confusing for people when sharing from a Mac to Windows the first time. What are you using as your username? On a Mac, you have an account name and an account ID, usually your name. For example, if the display (account) name is \"John Smith\", your username or account ID is probably \"johnsmith\". If you aren't sure what yours is, open Finder and navigate to \"/Users\". The folder that has a house icon is your user folder and named according to your username. This is what you will use on a Windows machine when asked for a username. \nIf that didn't work then you need to enable File Sharing on your Mac and specify a username and password for Windows users to use. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Click \"Sharing\"\n\n*Select \"File Sharing\"\n\n*Click \"Options\"\n\n*Check the box marked \"Share files and folders using SMB\"\n\n*Check the checkbox at the bottom of the dialog next to your account name and enter your password\n\n*Click \"OK\" and \"Done\" and enable File Sharing\n\n\nYou should now be able to access your specified files from Windows\n", "Q: How can I force an application to be launched to the 2nd monitor? macOS X 10.10.1 Yosemite. \nHow can I force a newly launched application to open to a specific monitor?\nFollowup questions: Failing that, how can I force a new window that a current application is opening to open in a specific monitor?\nAnd how can I move a borderless window?\n\nMy specific situation: \nI have a two-monitor set up.  My games open in \"Full Screen\" mode and make the second monitor useless.  The game in Windowed mode does not have the green full-screen button available in the top left.  However, it does allow me to set a custom resolution and set it in borderless mode.\nSo I've set the game's resolution to 1920x1060 (my monitor's resolution minus 20 pixel height to account for the menu bar at the top).  If I launch this game with borders, I can move the window wherever I want, but I also have to look at the border around the edge of my screen the entire time, which I'd rather not do.  Plus, for some reason, the game handles edge-scrolling significantly better in borderless (or full screen) versus windowed mode.\nI can't seem to figure out how to get the game onto my second monitor.  My first monitor has the dock on the left side, and that's where I want the dock to be.  But the game launches to this first monitor, and the dock sits over top of it.  I don't want to autohide the dock.  I don't want the dock in another position.  \nI'm looking for more control over this windowing system.\n\nA: Not sure if you're problem was solved, but this did the trick for me\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2990037/operating-systems/solve-mission-control-failing-to-allow-displays-as-spaces.html\n\nA: When the app is on the dock do left click on it and it will appear a menu. Select Options → Assign To Desktop on Display 2.\n\nAlternatively, I used Moom, that let me move a window from one monitor to another with a defined shortcut. In my case ⌥+⇥. But this is a paid software.\n\n\nA: Make any application start on the other monitor:\nI'm using macOS Mojave 10.14.  Consider the simpler solutions first: \n\n\n*\n\n*First decide which screen is your default by choosing the default monitor, maybe you can solve your problem by switching default monitor.  Go to System Preferences -> Displays -> Arrangement. The Screen with the horizontal white bar is the default.  Toggle that.\n\n*Second, see if your app has an internal window manager, like iterm2 and chrome browser does.  Look through app system settings or profiles. This is application specific and may not have anything.\n\n*There are many 3rd party apple window management systems, some free and some paid.  Install them and they will attempt to impose controls over how these programs start and stop and impose desktop location, window sizing and window positioning.  Careful as these programs may fight each other.\nIf none of the prepackaged solutions above are good enough:\nYou want total control over program start, window sizing, window positioning, window re-positioning, and program end from background scripts.\nPull out the power tools on Apple's Quartz Compositor Windows management system through apple's osascript tool:\nMake a new file demo.scpt with this in it:\n#this logs text to stdout\nlog(\"foobar\")\n#define a variable\nset moo to 9\nlog(moo)\n#get the window dimensions of the Iterm2 window:\ntell application \"Iterm2\" to set window_geometry to (get the bounds of the front window)\nlog(window_geometry)\ntell app \"Finder\" to display dialog \"hello world\"\n\nRun it like this from the terminal:\nosascript demo.scpt\n\nThe result of this little script reports the screen geometry of the Iterm2 window, and a screen pops up saying hello world.  Read the osascripting guide on how to pass parameters to choose monitor, sizing, positioning, anything the OS can see.  If osascript has sudo access, then it grants full read and modify access to the Quartz Compositor Windows management system.  \nUsing osascript to keep one foot in unix shell, and the other foot in the apple window management system, it appears to be turing complete as everything is visible and modifiable via scripting, you just have to read window geometry and apply window geometry on application start.  \nApply window positioning on open\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set position of first window of application process \"Preview\" to {10, 10}\n    set size of first window of application process \"Preview\" to {500, 1000}\nend tell\n\nRun it osascript demo.scpt and the Preview window is repositioned.\n\nA: Spectacle works too, and it's free!\nThe only downside compared to Moom is that it doesn't have the Windows-style hot edges.\nhttps://www.spectacleapp.com/\n", "Q: My computer logs out and sleeps after two or three songs play on itunes Recently I did some updating on my computer just to make the display better, change sleep length (extended, not shortened), and to add hot corners.  \nWell, now when we play up to two or three songs on iTunes, the computer logs the user out with no warning. I've gone to different timing settings, but I can't seem to find the problem.  \nAnyone know how to help?\n\nA: Open System Preferences→Security & Privacy, unlock the padlock if it's locked, and then in the Privacy pane click on the Advanced... button.

The plan is to wipe my iPod of regular music and replace it with Christmas music just for the season, then wipe it again and return to normal music. Any ideas?\n\nA: You can easily create a second iTunes library when you launch iTunes by holding Option (on a Mac) or Shift (on Windows). This allows you to specify a file name and location for the new library which you can populate with whatever media you like. When you want to switch back to your regular library, just hold down the appropriate key again when relaunching iTunes and select the original library file.\n", "Q: iMessages - same message on two devices I once bought a macbook for my friend. I logged into it using my own apple account to make sure it worked properly before delivering it to him. However, he now gets a copy of my iMessages. How can this link be removed so he will no longer be able to see my messages?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences→iCloud on his machine, sign out of your iCloud account and into his.\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove read, write, and execute permissions for 'others' recursively on home directory? I would like advice on whether it would be safe to block users not in the appropriate group from accessing my home directory. I have some servers running on my Mac (10.9) under a different account, and wish to decrease the consequences of a hacker exploiting one of them by preventing this account from accessing any of my personal files.\nI am intending to use file permissions for this, but I am concerned that this may break something, by blocking system processes from doing what they need to. I would ideally like to block all but root and my primary account from accessing my primary account's home directory, with chmod -R o-rwx ~.\nDoes anyone know whether this would cause any problems, and also whether it would be effective in preventing other accounts (that may not sudo, and are not admin in System Preferences, these may be the same, not sure) from accessing these files, excluding an EoP vulnerability?\n\nA: That depends on what is running on the server. If you have a web server running and serving other user's content from their home directories than the web server would not be able to read those files. \nWhen making this decision the group that the users belong to is also important. If all users are members of the staff group for example and if the home directories have read and execute permission for that group than other users will still be able to access those directories.\nHowever in general it should be safe and probably even the preferred method.\n\nA: I would not be changing permissions recursively on a user directory, ever.\nThis chances breaking too many things, particularly in the ~/Library folder.\nThe permissions structure of OS X is fairly robust and only allows privileged users or processes access to directories/files. Admin users can always sudo to affect changes (as members of the sudoers list) but are otherwise normally blocked from access to other users' Home directories other than the Public folder or any shared folder through File Sharing.\nFirewalling in front of your system is going to be a more secure method of blocking access to hackers.\n\nA: Unless you have changed it (or enabled sharing) only users in your group should have read access, but I can see no harm in removing permissions for others\n\nA: Your approach is perfectly secure, and used as a basic rule in securing any Unix filesystem.\nThis approach will protect you from any non admin account access, and protect you from becoming a deposit area for crapware coming from other accounts.\nThe uniq directory which is relevant to get an other access right is:\nPublic/Drop Box\n\nHence I advise you to avoid a basic:\nchmod -R o-rwx\n\nand prefer:\ncd\nfind . \\( -path \"./Public/Drop Box\" -prune \\) -o \\( -perm +0007 -ls \\)\n\nto check what you will modify, and then:\ncd\nfind . \\( -path \"./Public/Drop Box\" -prune \\) -o \\( -perm +0007 -exec chmod o-rwx {} \\}\n\nIf any software might get broken, then this software is a security problem or a crapware. It is a good idea to detect these weaknesses as soon as possible.\nLook at umask shell builin to avoid appearance of files whith any kind of other access.\n", "Q: Mail.app won't sync Gmail account I have several Gmail accounts. One in particular started demanding the password before sending emails. I have two factor authentication with the unrecoverable password so I had to delete the account and create it again.\nThis has led to Mail.app not synching that account anymore. I have the disconnected thunderbolt symbol over it, and hitting the send/receive button seems to do nothing.\nIs there something I can do to force Mail.app to work normally with that account? All others are fine.\n\nA: Tested on a 10.10.3 Yosemite MBP. I assume that you have created the Gmail account in the first place and that an entry exists in the Accounts tab of Preferences in Mail.app.\nIf you have enabled two factor authentication in your Google account then you need to create an App Password at https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords?pli=1. This is a critical step.\nTake this password you have just generated and go to Mail.app > Preferences > Accounts > your Google IMAP Account > Password field and add that password. Copy/paste works.\nIf it's a problem just to send mail, from the same place click the Outgoing Mail Server dropdown > Edit SMTP Server List... tab > smtp.gmail.com > Advanced tab > Password field and populate it with the same Google App Password.\nEither way, close preferences and say yes when prompted to save changes.\nNow, still in Mail.app, click Window > Connection Doctor and investigate the information there. You are looking for two entries, one is Google IMAP and one is SMTP next to the Google account name you are concerned with.\nIf you have green lights, you are good to go. Red lights indicate a server communication problem.\nYou can change passwords now that you know where without deleting/creating a new account every time you have an issue.\n\nA: I assume you deleted the gmail account in Mail.app.\nThen you recreated it using Mail.app (+) to add new account.\nI assume you entered the correct IMAP info:\nIncoming mail imap.gmail.com\nOutgoing mail smtp.gmail.com\nYou also did the \"Enable this Account\" in the Mail Preferences Accounts window.\nYou also have the Port: 993 and Use SSL.\nYou do not have anything in the IMAP path prefix window.\nPassword:\nIs stored in your keychain.

How can I fix this?\nHere's the world's simplest Applescript, for the sake of an easy example:\nset volume output volume 0\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 20\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 0\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 20\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 0\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 20\ndelay 5\nset volume output volume 0\n\nThat should take 30 seconds to complete.  If I run it in Script Editor (formerly Applescript Editor) it takes 30 seconds to complete.  But if I save this script as an app, when I launch the app, the delays are ignored and the app takes a fraction of a second to complete.\nHow can I force Applescript to delay for a specified amount of time before moving on to the next step?  Is this a Yosemite glitch?  Is there a reliable workaround?\n\nA: Note: The issue with delay was fixed in OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n@2oh1, you have the right basic idea in your answer, but here's a complete and correct answer:\nThe only reasonable way to work around this is to invoke \"delay\" within a loop that ensures the desired duration elapses before continuing. The best way to do this is to override \"delay\" with a custom handler:\non delay duration\n  set endTime to (current date) + duration\n  repeat while (current date) is less than endTime\n    tell AppleScript to delay endTime - (current date)\n  end repeat\nend delay\n\nThis enables you to leave the rest of your script unchanged and you can use \"delay\" normally, e.g.,\ndelay 5\ndisplay alert \"I like cake!\"\n\n[NOTE: Normally, the custom handler would use \"continue delay duration\" to invoke the built-in \"delay\", but I found that, although this works within Script Editor, it returns an error when used within an applet (“Can’t continue delay. (-1708)”). I worked around that issue by directly telling AppleScript to handle the delay command instead of using \"continue\" to get there.]\nThe issue is that delay processes user input while pausing the script, so you can still click on menus or windows displayed by an applet, and there is a bug (fixed in 10.11) where user input causes delay to not wait the full duration before resuming script execution. If you don't interact with the applet, delay works correctly.\n\nA: While battling this same problem I came across this answer to a not-so-related question and decided to try it and it seems to work for me.\nReplace delay 5 with do shell script \"/bin/sleep 5\" and get the same result.\n\nA: I'm not saying this is the best solution, but it seems to have solved my problem.  Instead of using a simple delay, which is being ignored for reasons I do not understand, I've switched to getting the time and looping until a new time is reached (it still uses a delay, but it doesn't matter if it ignores the delay since the script doesn't continue until the time is reached).\n# Pause for five minutes\nset GetTheTime to current date\nset NewTime to GetTheTime + (5 * minutes)\nrepeat while (current date) is less than NewTime\n    delay 60\nend repeat\n\nI'm still dying to know why delay is being ignored (or dramatically sped up?!??), but this gets the job done, clumsy as it is.\n\nA: I found a work-around in a German forum post. Add these lines to the top of your script:\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\ncurrent application's NSThread's sleepForTimeInterval:1\n\n\nA: carzyj had what I consider the best answer, but when combined with Chris Page's method, you get:\non delay duration\n  do shell script \"/bin/sleep \" & duration\nend delay\n\nYou can comment out \"on delay\" through \"end delay\" to revert to the original delay.\n\nA: this is a modification to @chris-page solution\nIt seems to be a balance between responsiveness and accurately capturing the delay.\non delay duration\n    set endTime to (current date) + duration\n    repeat while (current date) is less than endTime\n        set delta to duration / 100\n        if duration < 0.2 then\n            set delta to 0.2\n        end if\n        tell AppleScript to delay delta\n    end repeat\nend delay\n\nBut instead of telling Applescript to delay for the overall duration, we just tell it to delay for a fractional period of the duration. if the period is less than what apple allows (1/60 of a second), then let's just set it to that delta. That we can keep some responsiveness, yet still be accurate. the suspicion is that sometimes delay doesn't work so the repeat while loop will keep the thread locked up, but in success scenarios, we want the delay delta to be short so that the process can still be interrupted\n\nA: So, to put it all together, I believe Chris means this:\non delay duration\n   set endTime to (current date) + duration\n   repeat while (current date) is less than endTime\n      tell AppleScript to delay endTime - (current date)\n   end repeat\nend delay\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to measure data traffic from airport extreme?

If you bought a SSD that needs trim support (at time of writing, all SSDs benefit) such as the Samsung 840 Evo, there are many reported issues when performing PRAM reset and potential future system update conflicts in addition to the current security tradeoffs (see below). Trim Enabler author says using Trim Enabler by turning off kext signing is cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer. \nI'm hoping for strategy / options to work with SSDs that recommend or require Trim support. So far, because of this article, I'm considering a SSD with Sandforce or equivalent active garbage collection. I'm also considering turning on Trim Enabler periodically, then off and reenabling kext-signing to avoid issues with until (if) Apple restores TRIM support to hardware and software devs.\nPlease detail working hardware/software configurations and strategy/schedule as well as outcomes.\ntl;dr --\nSome background:\n3rd party SSDs for the most part don't have trim support in Yosemite without kext signing security tradeoffs. Apple changed kext signing in OS X 10.10 such that kext singing must be disabled to use applications like Trim Enabler for trim support. So choices using Yosemite are, reduced security and potential system update issues; or, a SSD that doesn't require Trim support.\nYosemite kills third-party SSD support. This is not relevant if you're using an Apple installed SSD or SSD that doesn't require 3rd party trim support for optimal function. So, if you're using a DIY SSD, Trim support is tricky in Yosemite because of recent modifications to kext security management that affects Trim support. More about Trim Enabler for Mac:\n\nAbout Trim in Yosemite In OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), \nApple has introduced a new security requirement called kext signing. (A kext is\n  a kernel extension, or a driver, in Mac OS X)\nKext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the\n  system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they\n  have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver. This is a\n  means of enforcing security, but also a way for Apple to control what\n  hardware that third party developers can release OS X support for.\nSince Trim Enabler works by unlocking the Trim driver for 3rd party\n  SSD’s, this security setting prevents Trim Enabler to enable Trim on\n  Yosemite.\nTo continue to use Trim Enabler and continue to get Trim for your\n  third party SSD, you first need to disable the kext signing security\n  setting.\nIt is important to note that the kext-signing setting is global, if\n  you disable it you should be careful to only install system drivers\n  from sources that you trust.\n\n\nA: See my answer here: \nSince the release of 10.10.4, Apple now provides a new tool called trimforce, allowing users to activate TRIM also on unsupported disks. So now you can do: \nsudo trimforce enable\n\n\nA: It is true that disabling the kext signing is global, but before Yosemite, it did not exist at all, so compared to a pre-10.10 setup you do not lose security. The only thing you need to do is make sure every driver you install can be trusted (and how often does one install drivers).\nI would simply use TRIM enabler, it has not created problems for me. For the unlikely event that I should be met by the grey stop sign at boot, I printed out the instructions from Cindori to disable the signing again and carry it in my laptop bag.\n\nA: I had this problem and decided to go with a SSD having built in garbage collection (namely a Crucial MX100 for this reason).\nAFAIK, this is the only solution for those not willing to disable Kext signing but willing to keep the SSD in pristine condition.\nEDIT: According to French site macplus.net, a new Yosemite friendly TRIM solution by TRIM Enabler's creator is in the making and should see a beta release in early 2015.\n\nA: @carfish: so you buy a car without ABS braking, because it is safe because before modern cars there was no ABS??\n@samric: the french trick is a hack: they just change the name inside the SSD into Apple name. Obviously that will only be a shortlived \"solution\" because it is illegal.\nIn general: Trim for non-apple SSDs is not wise: there is a (small) chance that it causes an issue on the file level on the SSD (irrepairable); and also the modern SSDs have a very good GarbageCollection system: as long as there is enough free space it is as good as the Trim induced GarbageCollection. If you are afraid that GC has not enough space, just format the SSD to 10% smaller than the total space and leave that 10% unformatted.\nTrim is not worth the disrobing of a global level of security.\nLexS\n\nA: Personally I have a samsung pro ssd and trim enabler app didn't help me on enabling the trim support. Chameleon ssd optimizer is the answer and is free.\nI tried 2 times: the first time didn't work. Make sure before it asks you to restart the trim is enabled. Cancel the restart and wait for the chameleon to disable the trim lock then restart.\n\nA: https://github.com/Temptin/Documents/blob/master/Yosemite_Patchless_TRIM.md\nBrings forward the method of enabling TRIM using 'trimforce' in the command line. It does EXACTLY what Apple's official TRIM enabler will do with 10.0.4, without disabling Kext. Does Trim enabler give anything more for $10? I might be missing something. \n\nA: Wondering if anyone has tried this:  Run your 3rd party SSD on Yosemite with kext enabled and no TRIM and once a week--or as needed-- boot from a bootable Mavericks external and run a TRIM Enabler over night. In the morning, shutdown, remove the bootable external drive and restart with Yosemite.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone capture screenshots as PNG? Is there a reason for iPhone to save screenshots taken as .PNG instead of .JPG?\nScreenshots won't have transparent background anyways.\n\nA: PNG is not only useful for allowing transparency: PNG is a lossless format, while JPEG uses a lossy form of compression. Also PNG does compress screenshots pretty well (unlike camera photos, which is why Apple uses JPG for those).\n\nMore info if interested:\n\nAlso, A technical overview of what PNG is good for is worth reading (it's basically one of the main references on the topic and contains enough details to spend the day on it). Excerpt:\n\nFor the Web, as of early 1999, there are two image formats with\n  ubiquitous support: JPEG and GIF. JPEG is very well suited to the task\n  for which it was designed--namely, the storage, transmission, and\n  display of photorealistic 8-bit grayscale and 24-bit truecolor images\n  with good quality and excellent compression--and PNG was never\n  intended to compete with JPEG on its own terms. But PNG, like GIF, is\n  more appropriate than JPEG for images with few colors or with lots of\n  sharp edges, such as cartoons or bitmapped text. PNG also provides\n  direct support for gamma correction (loosely speaking, the\n  cross-platform control of image ``brightness'') and transparency. I'll\n  discuss these in more detail shortly.\nGIF was the original cross-platform image format for the Web, and it\n  is still a good choice in many respects. But PNG was specifically\n  designed to replace GIF, and it has three main advantages over the\n  older format: alpha channels (variable transparency), gamma\n  correction, and two-dimensional interlacing (a method of displaying\n  images at progressively higher levels of detail). PNG also compresses\n  better than GIF in almost every case, but the difference is generally\n  only around 5% to 25%, which is (usually) not a large enough factor to\n  encourage one to switch on that basis alone. One GIF feature that PNG\n  does not try to reproduce is multiple-image support, especially\n  animations; PNG was and is intended to be a single-image format only.\n  A very PNG-like extension format called MNG has been developed to\n  address this limitation.\n\n\nA: Because this:\n\n\n\nlooks a lot better than this:\n\n\n\nOK, so I had to crank the JPEG compression quality way down to make the compression artifacts that obvious, but the point remains — a PNG screenshot shows exactly what you see on the screen, whereas a JPEG screenshot is always a little bit lossy (yes, even if you crank the quality up to 100).\nBesides, PNG tends to be pretty good at compressing images with large areas of flat color, sharp edges and repetitive patterns (like text).  Thus, in many cases, a lossless PNG screenshot can actually be smaller than a JPEG screenshot saved at any acceptable quality level.\n\nA: One of the functions of a screenshot is to show someone else a particular visual artifact you're seeing on your device -- perhaps to show a visual glitch to an app developer. In such cases, any compression artifacts could be a distraction from the actual issue under discussion; the screenshot needs to be pixel-perfect.\nThus, a lossless format like .PNG is mandatory.\n", "Q: How to remove Local Disk entries in DCIM sub-folders in iPhone? in iOS 8, multiple entries of \"Local Disk\" spawned every time I use Windows 7 File Explorer to transfer files to my computer.\n\nHow to remove those? and when will iPhone / iOS re-index those random sub-folders in DCIM folder?\n\nA: Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data > Remove All Website Data\nWorked for me with iOS 8.

You should (and I say 'should' because it may not be the case with your particular build of the Windows installer image) have a few options there, the normal Macintosh HD and Recovery 10.x, and then a couple of Windows options. One should be a regular BIOS link to the Windows installer, and the other should be a UEFI link to the installer.

I'm still in \"setup assistant\" mode.\nThe amount of information being transferred is about 120Gb.  I've tried transferring over a direct-connected Ethernet from Mac-to-Mac, as well as a brand new Time Machine backup to an external SSD connected via a Thunderbolt 1 breakout box.\nEvery time I try to transfer, the transfer makes it to the applications stage in a reasonable amount of time.  The progress bar is almost full. Then it starts doing the applications.  At first, the screen shows \"Transferring Applications\"/\"Transferring files to support applications\" pretty fast.  Then it starts getting slower.  And slower.  All the while, the completion time (which was \"about a minute\" starts creeping up.)  The first time I let it run all night.  By morning it was saying there would be over 250 hours to completion.\nI've tried it 4 times since then (including a complete system reinstall), and the same thing happens every time.\nI feel like I'm down to 2 scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac Pro has a hardware issue.  I've already run the hardware diagnostics, but nothing shows up.  That being said, this is a refurb, it's possible something is wrong that only affects the new machine during long transfers.\n\n*There's something in the backup or my applications setup that's causing the migration to get stuck in a loop.  I've looked on the system drive for a log, but I haven't found one.\nHere's where it gets really, really bizarre: I can't find any sign of the files transferred on the new Mac after I've stopped it.  Not a single file appears on \"Macintosh HD\" on the new Mac.\nAny ideas? Apple can't help me in the store until Monday, so I thought I'd ask here.\n\nA: Also not really an answer but more a practical approach.\nAnother idea that requires manual work. I did this with a Macbook Pro and a MacPro 2006:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your old MacPro into Firewire Target Mode (yes this works with \"T\" on power on).\n\n*Connect it to you new MacPro with a FireWire cable.\n\n*Mount all harddiscs\n\n*Copy over all data you need, but leave out the Library folder in your old homedirectory.\n\n*Do a fresh install of your favourite software, that is quicker and safer that copying them from the old MacPro or a TimeMachine Backup. You will definitely miss important files. (just my experience with MS Office)\n\n\nPositive effect of this: you trashed all old things you really do not need. :-)\nI even go a step further - On my old MacPro I set all files and directories I want to copy on a red label in the finder. When mounting the harddiscs, I immediately see what is important and needs to be copied. :-) And as a reminder of which software I will need on the new machine, I set the finder label \"green\" to all applications I will need on my new machine.\n\nA: Not really an answer to the real issue, but an alternative that somehow worked:\nI ended up loading the recovery partition on the new Mac (CMD+R while booting), and choosing to restore from TimeMachine.\nIt took about 15-20 minutes to completely restore everything, and the new computer has been running fine ever since.\nI know this is usually a bad idea, since I'm restoring to a completely different machine, but it seems to have worked with no obvious ill results.\nJust an option if you are desperate as I was.\n\nA: This happened to me when migrating to my current Macbook Pro. What worked for me was to migrate everything except Applications, and then reinstall those as needed. Fortunately, since it does still copy over your home directory, all my Application preferences were still there, so it was fairly painless.\n", "Q: Is there really a Mid 2014 13-inch Macbook Air?

Be careful though, it's a powerful tool so make sure you know what you're doing with it before you do anything.\nAs for boot time, make sure you don't have a lot of daemons loading at launch. One easy way to check is to go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > [Your User] > Login Items and remove anything listed there that you don't need launching at startup. Anything with a default document icon means it doesn't exist and can be safely removed. Ideally, the only item that should be listed is iTunesHelper, but if you don't use any iOS devices, then you can remove that too.\nAnother few places to check for daemons and login items is \"~/Library/LaunchDaemons/\", \"~/Library/LaunchAgents\", \"/Library/LaunchDaemons\" and \"/Library/LaunchAgents\". If you see anything listed for software you don't use anymore, trash it. Certain other apps load daemons in to here too that you might not need; Adobe is a big culprit here with their Flash Player updater, Adobe Reader updater, and AAM.

The open command is run within ftp.\n\nA: ftp hostname\n\nor\nftp://username:password@hostname\n\nNow, once connected the 5 most common options are:\ncd foldername      #e.g. cd /downloads/recent\nget filename       #e.g. get thisisthefileiwant.text\nput filename       #e.g. put sendthistotheserver.txt\nmget filenameregex #e.g mget * to get every file in a directory\nmput filemameregex #e.g. mput *.txt to upload every txt file to the server\n\nThe only trickery is sometimes you might need to put it into binary mode by typing binary\nTo exit, type bye\nThe difference between mine and @grgarside 's solution is his forks it to the Finder using open, while mine uses Terminal\n", "Q: Create SavedSearch Criteria Using OR not AND I'd like to create a savedSearch in Finder that looks for recent Documents AND pdf's. If I create a rule such as:\nKind is Document\nKind is PDF\n\nit will look for things that are Documents AND pdfs. How do I set it to look for Documents OR pdfs?\n\nA: Yes, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Finder. Create a Smart Folder using the key combination Option+Command+N\n\n*Click the + icon. Kind is any is the default search rule. Leave it for now. \n\n*Most important step: Hold down the Option key. You will see the + icon change to …\n\n*Simply click the … icon to add conditional criteria. Use the default, \"Any : of the following are true”\n\n*Specify the criteria using two rules: Kind is Document and Kind is PDF\n\n*Now, delete first search rule made in Step 2. Here is a screenshot of the result:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, “any of the following..” functions as “or” (versus “all of the following..” which functions as “and”) \n\nA: Since PDF is also a Document those can not be separated with a \"or\".\nIf you want to search only for pure Documents (non PDF) , the use the serch box and select what kind of document you are after\n\nIf you want to search for PDF (that are also Documents use that.\n", "Q: What's netbiosd? I must block netbiosd? I was asked to block netbiosd, but do not know what is. I must to block all connections from netbiosd?\n\nA: From Apple's netbiosd man page:\n\nnetbiosd is responsible for interacting with NetBIOS networks.  netbiosd registers and defends one or more NetBIOS name, depending on the set of configured services. It also browses and scavenges names from the NetBIOS network, making them available to the system through mDNSResponder.\n\nSimply put, no, netbiosd is a perfectly safe daemon included in OS X by Apple.\n", "Q: Transferring photos from my new iPad to 2008 refurbished MacBook 13\" Can I use iCloud to transfer photos from my new iPad to 2008 refurbished MacBook 13\"?\n\nA: You've tagged that you're running Snow Leopard so no, not really. iCloud was introduced with OS X Lion (which is no longer available) and unless you upgrade to the maximum RAM for your system (Apple lists it as 4GB), I wouldn't recommend updating to OS X Yosemite just yet.\nHowever, you should still be able to access iCloud from the website through Safari to access your Reminders, Calendars, Photos and Contacts, and Mail will allow you to set up  your iCloud email account. You can also use Image Capture and iPhoto to copy photos from your iPad to your MacBook, so long as they were saved to the device's Camera Roll (that is, weren't copied to it from another computer via iTunes).\n", "Q: Why do I have /Volumes/Storage Drive?

It should be perfectly safe to rm -rf it, especially if it is empty.\nNote: If you rm -rf in /Volumes, make sure you specify which directory  to operate on (i.e. DON'T JUST rm -rf /Volumes!) otherwise you will delete everything on every mounted disk, including your root drive (granted, it will throw permissions errors before doing anything to your OS first but still).

My teenage daughter's Mac Mini (running OSX 10.8) was cluttered with all sorts of stuff, even unwanted and inappropriate popup windows when using Safari, and more. So I made a final TM backup. Then I did a clean install of Mavericks.\nNow, I wanted to bring back individual files and folders from that TM backup, BUT...\n\n\n*\n\n*going to Migration Assistant, I realized that it would overwrite the clean install and bring back the clutter. This is no option.\n\n*going to TM, I realized I wasn't able to select any of the snapshots from the timeline\n\n*going to the external drive containing the TM backup with Finder, all folders within her \"old\" user-folder showed a small red stop-sign, which I learned is an issue with permissions. I wasn't able to restore manually.\n\n\nWhat to do now?\nI know I could restore the cluttered state and copy folders and files manually to an external drive, make another clean install of Mavericks, then copy manually from that external drive. This seems a lot of time and work to me.\nIs there an easier way?\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*going to the external drive containing the TM backup with Finder, all folders within her \"old\" user-folder showed a small red stop-sign, which I learned is an issue with permissions. I wasn't able to restore manually.\n  \n\nThis is probably the easiest way to go.  \nYou can fix the \"red stop-sign\" issue by opening Terminal and entering: \nsudo diskutil disableOwnership /Volumes/[Your TM Drive].\nYou'll then be able to copy the files over manually, without having to worry about permissions.\n\nA: If you look on that Time Machine drive you should see a top-level folder named Backups.backupdb. If you open that folder you will see a machine name folder, inside that a series of dated folders representing individual backup instances. Inside each of those you will find \"Macintosh HD\" or whatever your hard disk used to be called. In there, find your files!\nHere's what one of mine looks like:\n\nYou will not necessarily find ever file at every date, so you should have some idea of when the last good backup of the file you want was made.\nFiles appear not to be encrypted* or compressed so it should be as simple as just dragging them back to where you want them. I was able to restore a text file this way.\n*you may have set your Time Machine backup to be encrypted... in which case it should not be encrypted once you have entered the volume password. If it is encrypted in this way you won't see anything.\nOne final note - you may need to authenticate as the user who made the backup to access the files. So if restoring to an account with a different username or password, be prepared to provide the correct details.\n\nA: Your account has to have the same username as the pre-wipe account. Make a new account with the pre-wipe account's username, and you should be able to get your files without needing to authenticate every time!\n(Thanks to 0942v8653 for saying that you only need the username. If it still doesn't work, try making the password the same too.)\n\nA: I have a late 2008 macbook pro and time capsule. I rebooted and renamed my hard drive years later. I wanted to recover my files manually. Doing so individually or all at once and put on another portable hard drive so I could pick and choose what I wanted to use in the future. Nothing would show up in Time Machine. And I also wasn’t sure how to copy large quantities at once.\n\n\n*\n\n*I plugged in the network cable to y laptop then the TC. Then power. \n\n*I couldn’t figure out who to get into the bundle, so I found this and typed it in terminal. Change WHOEVER to your computer name.\nhdiutil attach -noverify /Volumes/WHOEVER's-1/WHOEVER’s MacBook Pro.sparsebundle\n\n\n*It was supposed to mount so I could peek inside without TM but it didn’t work.\n\n*I also tried right-clicking on the bundle and ‘show package contents’. Then click on the Bands folder or whatever. Takes a while to load all the files.\n\n*Not sure if that worked either. So I went in TM and this is what worked for me.\n\n\n\n*Under the ‘Now’ state, I clicked on my WHOEVER’s Macbook Pro, in the left window pane.\n\n*I clicked on my TC hard drive OR whatever you named yours.\n\n*I clicked on the sparsebundle backup.\nTHIS IS WHERE TM’s LOGIC COMES IN TO PLACE. —You must have the sparsebundle selected AND THEN ‘GO BACK IN TIME’ by clicking the up arrow. This will effectively GO BACK to when that backup made sense, ie. 2012!… \n\n\n*I click the up arrow to back in time only once. It took me to the most recent accomplished backup file.\n\n*ONCE I was browsing in this window, I clicked on MACINTOSH HD. Then USERS. Then MY NAME. I looked around and was excited to see OLD FILES!! :)\n\n*So this is where you want to be. I tested a couple files and the following worked for me: Right click on the folder you want to TRANSFER. Click on ‘RESTORE FILE TO…”\n\n*This should take you out of TM. You will then be able to CHOOSE A FOLDER on your computer. I chose my attached portable hard drive (a lot of space).\n\n*I chose to backup the entire MACINTOSH HD. IT TAKES A LONG TIME!! Choose your location and WALK AWAY. Come back in 30 minutes and you should see “20 GB of 500 GB - About 8 hours” or something.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: The easiest thing by far is migrating and making a clean (non time machine) back up of your root or desktop file system. Time Machine is great but it makes what you are doing unnecessarily laborious. Though it takes a while to migrate and then copy and then reinstall a clean copy most of that time is passive work. So just set it and forget it or your going to end up spending as much time working on creating your solution as you are to implement it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download and install BatchMod\n\n*Open the Users folder in the backup:\n\n\n*Drag the user folder (in my example 'eva') to BatchMod:\n\n\n*Modify the settings like in the picture above\n\n*Hit Apply - you will be asked to enter your password. It may take a while to adjust the new permissions.\n\n*Copy all needed files and folders to your new user folder\n\n", "Q: Should i Buy SSD first or RAM for my Macbook? I have a macbook pro 15 inch mid 2010.\nFor school i have to use mostly Adobe applications but they take so long to boot up. \nNot only these programs but other programs too.\nWhat should i do to improve my macbook.\nI was thinking to upgrade my ram from 4GB to 8GB.\nI was also thinking to buy a Samsung Evo 840 128GB SSD.\nBut i don't know which one should i buy first.\nWhich one should i buy first? (SSD or Ram?)\n\nA: Don't get a 128GB SSD. You don't want to run a 3rd party SSD on OS X without a decent amount of free space since you won't have TRIM support.\nDoes Activity Monitor show memory pressure? If not, I'd save my pennies until I could afford a 256GB or 512GB SSD. I've done both RAM and SSD upgrades many times and an SSD has always been by far the best upgrade in changing the \"feel\" of the computer.\n\nA: Once programs are started they reside in RAM. \nSo if you have enough RAM they will be fast. \nA fast SSD will be also helpful but usually it is not used much during normal operation if you have large RAM space.\nI would start with RAM upgrade, since the RAM is acting as SSD but it is faster.\nMain difference in SSD you will see when starting up the computer, or starting new applications (that are not in RAM yet).\nThat said, it is only a budget question, but having both is the best solution.\n\nA: If you want to boot up programs faster, i would advice you buy the SSD first. This is the part of your computer that is responsible for booting up programs.\n\nA: In my experience, an SSD has led to faster load times (a formerly-1:20 boot time became 18 seconds!), but a RAM upgrade has epically increased the stability of the computer (I used to get the beach ball of death on a daily basis, which the SSD did nothing to combat, but I can count how many times I've gotten it since going from 4 to 10 GB a few weeks ago on one hand).\nAnalogy time! If using a computer is like a road trip, getting an SSD is like getting a faster car, and getting more RAM is like improving the quality of the road. It's all about what matters more to you, pure speed or overall smoothness.\n\nA: Upgrade to SSD first then only come the RAM. There is software to help you enable TRIM support for third party SSD\n", "Q: Weird removable drive I have a removable 16gig flash drive from lacie.

Then he can use the arrow keys left/right to show the other images in this directory.\nOn OS X, you can open a finder after attaching, double click an image but in preview.app, which opens then, you can not navigate to the other pictures. Another option is to select all images (CMD + A) and drag and drop them to the preview.app-icon in the dock. But thats very error-prone if he accidentally rise the mouse button while dragging.\nIt's not a solution to import the photos in any application like iPhoto, Lightroom or so for this case, because the Mac is just for viewing them. They are always imported later on another computer. I'm afraid of the suspense, which files are the most up to date ones or to clean his Mac every two weeks.\nI'd like to have a simple tool for that, I can install. Ideally, it will pre-load the next pictures I can navigate to, to speed things up. Windows does so.\n\nA: Use Quick Look. Select the first image, then press Space. The arrow keys can then be used to navigate through the images.\n", "Q: Where do you get the tool they use at the Genius Bar to remove SIM cards? I was at the Genius Bar recently and the techs had a tiny tool on their loop of cables that looked like a pin with an oval-shaped loop at the top. Anyone know where to acquire this tool?\nI know I could cut and bend a small paper clip, but this looked a bit thinner and sturdier. They used it to pop out the SIM card and clean out the Lightning port.\n\nA: If you purchase an international or unlocked iPhone, it comes with this SIM ejection tool. They cannot be purchased from Apple, however they are sold on eBay/Amazon/etc.\n\nA: The \"Apple SIM ejector\" is a glorified paperclip. A much better (and more comfortable) tool is a 0.8mm hex driver. Find the precision tools section of your local hardware store and get one that fits. Do NOT get a pointy-end driver like Phillips. Hex drivers have flat ends and smooth sides.\nAnd don't use metal objects to clean out the connector - a toothpick won't scratch up the electrical connections.\n", "Q: How to debug my webcam problems? I'm quite a new OS X user and come from a linux background - usually to debug my problems I consult the logs as per /var/log/syslog however with Yosemite i'm not sure what i'm looking for.\nAny way my problem is that I will load Skype and video call someone which works fine but the moment my mac is locked or goes into hibernation mode the next time I try video call the web cam is not detected - if i attempt to use Photo Booth this too doesn't detect a webcam.

Before, the Dock would pop up when the mouse was at the very bottom.  But the current behavior makes it difficult to access things like tabs on a spreadsheet because the Dock comes up and covers them.  What is to be done?\n\nA: Try following in Terminal to adjust the Dock behavior.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.5\n\ncompliment that with killall Dock to make it active.\nThe number at the end is in seconds (delay) so choose what it suits you.\nTo return to original settings use\ndefaults delete com.apple.Dock autohide-time-modifier\n\n\nA: My personal solution?\na) Put the dock on the side of the screen, not at the bottom. Screens are generally wider than they are tall, and documents are generally taller than they are wide. Screen real estate is much more precious at the bottom than at the sides.\nb) Never let the dock hide. Having the dock hide is not useful, because the space it covers isn't really available for anything else, as you've noticed. A hidden dock entices you to put things in places on your screen that you cannot reach.\nBut that's just my opinion. Yours may vary, or course. But you did ask....\n", "Q: Where are airdrop files located on ios? I sent my files(pdf, docs...) from macbook to iphone but i did not open my files when received.

You have to pick one if you want to keep the file. If you just press Cancel, the file gets deleted. If the file(s) are photos or videos (compatible with ios) they end up in the photo album.

I have an MBA running Yosemite. Apps like Mail, messages, calendar, and FaceTime have 'banner' notifications that pop up in my laptop's built-in display but they don't pop up on my external monitor that's plugged in via a thunderbolt adapter. \nHow can I get notifications to display on my active display?\nIs this even possible or a feature that is yet to be implemented by Apple?\n\nA: Go to notifications and under the section \"Turn on Do Not Disturb\" toggle off, \"When mirroring to TVs and projectors\".\n\nA: Try this: System Preferences -> Displays and drag menubar (small white stripe at the top of the blue box in the \"Arrangement\" tab) to your external (attached) display. Built-in notifications will be displayed on the monitor with main menubar.\nIn addition to this you may wish to explore Growl app (http://growl.info/), which allows you to setup notifications in more sophisticated way and configure them for several displays.\n", "Q: Can I change iCloud ID I originally created an Apple ID for use on the App Store in iTunes.\nWhen Apple introduced iCloud my Apple ID ended up being used.\nI would like to separate these. I don't want to lose my app purchases (which I would like to share with family), so creating a new iCloud ID seems the best option.\nI can't find any method of changing. Is this possible?\nI assume if I create a new iCloud ID it would need to resynch everything.\n\nA: They don't have to be the same. Sign out of iCloud in Settings and set up the new Apple ID. Then, if that Apple ID's also been applied to the stores, go to one of them, sign out, and sign back in with your store Apple ID.\nSource: My own experience - my iPod Touch works fine with my own Apple ID for iCloud and my family's Apple ID for the stores.\n", "Q: Strange padlock icon on status bar (not rotation-lock!) I recently noticed that a strange padlock icon with a \"T\" in it on my status bar. It is not rotation-lock tho. What exactly is this?\niPhone 5s, iOS 7.0.6\n\n\nA: This icon does not appear in any of the devices running iOS 7 or 8. \nIt's probably caused by a jailbreak tweak. OpenNotifier is one such jailbreak tweak which lets you customise the status bar to indicate notifications from any app. The icon does not seem to relate to anything specific so it's quite impossible to tell what's it's indicating. Checking the tweak settings could tell what's that icon is indicating.\n", "Q: iCloud Security Questions I am trying to create a new iCloud account. This requires me to enter security questions. I normally have no issue with this, but I am offered only 6 choices, and frankly I don't know the answers to any of them.\nE.g. one asks for the name of my favourite primary teacher. None of them were, and I don't remember the names after 55 years.\nHow do I enter my own questions, which is what I normally do.\n\nA: You can actually enter any information as your answers. Moreover, this is better option actually as it adds security against people who may know or guess your answers.\nThe only important thing is to remember this information or at least keep it safely. You'll need it in case of any problems with access to your iCloud account either to restore by yourself or through tech support.\nYour options are:\n1. Memorize your answers\n2. Write them down (not safe!)\n3. Use any password utility (like 1password, for instance) that help you keep all your info safe.\nThat's the easiest way to deal with the subject. Changing questions requires you to communicate with Apple with no guarantees of success.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: From a security standpoint I always recommend that people DO NOT answer these questions with truthful answers. Instead I advise using random strings of text because then it is much more difficult for individuals to hijack your account even if they know you personally.\n", "Q: Disassociate an Apple ID from a computer There's a work computer (iMac) I'll soon stop using, which might be used by other people in the future.\nWhile I've mainly used a separate work-only Apple ID on the computer, I suspect I may have used my personal Apple ID on the computer from time to time.\nI want to make sure that my personal Apple ID isn't used in the future on the work computer. How do I ensure this is the case?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, and check \"iCloud\" and \"Internet Accounts\". Sign out where necessary, and once neither of them list your personal account, you're good to go.\nYou may also want to make sure your web browsers don't remember any of your passwords.\n\nA: Removing an associated device or computer from an Apple ID\nTo remove a device or computer from your Apple ID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Sign in to your Apple ID by choosing Store > Sign In from the iTunes menu.\n\n*Choose Store > View My Account from the iTunes menu. \n\n*From the Account Information screen, click Manage Devices.\n\n*Click the Remove button next to the device name you would like to unassociate. \n\n\nNote: Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the 90-day timer.

I have a Mac mini (Mac Mini 5,1 Mid 2011 , 2.3GHz intel Core i5, 4GB RAM) model that has a stock HDD (Toshiba MK5065GSX 500 GB SATA III 5400 RPM).\nThe HDD has a SMART issue and I have ordered Seagate's ST500LM000 (500 GB laptop thin SSHD).\nThe only thing I am worried now is that Toshiba HDD had 9.5mm size while the SSHD has 7mm thickness. Would new SSHD be compatible and inserted without any extra stuff,effort and adjustment OR should I stick to a 9.5mm drive only ?\n\nA: I think there ought to be enough play in the connectors that it will fit without further modification.\nThe only real issue with a mini is that the drives are fixed from underneath rather than from the top. This will move the connectors by 2.5 mm from where they initially were.\nJudging from the iFixit guide on adding a second drive, there would appear to be enough play in that connector strip that you will get away with that small move.\nCompared to all the effort to get in there, though, if you find you don't have enough play in it, packing out the top by a couple of mm really shouldn't be much of a challenge. We're talking beermat depth, or a couple of pieces of folded card, not major engineering work.\n", "Q: Restore missing Ringtones, iOS 8 How do I recover and set my ringtone to the lollipop guild, a song I had already purchased?\n\nA: Make sure your phone is updated to iOS 8.1.2 - this was a known issue in 8.1.1\nAs you update you will get a notice about it & a link to follow to get your ringtones back.\nSee Restore missing tones on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 8.1.1\n", "Q: To create a new apple ID on another iPhone Now my wife is holding iPhone 5S.

I have tried uninstalling iPhoto and reinstalling using the App Store.\nThe error I receive is this, full crash log:\nException Type:        EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000\n\nApplication Specific Information:\ndyld: launch, loading dependent libraries\n\nDyld Error Message:\n  Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/NyxAudioAnalysis.framework/Versions/A/NyxAudioAnalysis\n  Referenced from: /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents/Frameworks/iLifeSlideshow.framework/Versions/A/iLifeSlideshow\n  Reason: image not found\n\nFrom what I can tell, there are certain libraries that can't be loaded. Apparently, simply reinstalling iPhoto does not do the trick. Is there anything else I can do?\n\nA: I found a proper solution to this problem:\nI had used the Migration Assistant to migrate my old Mac System (10.8 or so) to a newly bought Mac Mini with 10.10 (Yosemite). After a few day I found out that iPhoto wasn’t starting — with the described symptoms.\nFortunately I still have the old system running, so I could compare them and copying the old NyxAudioAnalysis directory did the job. \nEverything could be fine here, but I wondered why when reparing my access rights the disk utility kept telling me there was a problem with the directory. It said it was a directory, but was expected to be a symbolic link:\nAbweichende Zugriffsrechte für „Library/Frameworks/NyxAudioAnalysis.framework“, Soll-Wert: lrwxr-xr-x , Ist-Wert: drwxr-xr-x .\n\n(German version here, sorry.)\nSince I have another box running under Yosemite I could compare the systems and I found out that Apple had moved the location of the NyxAudioAnalysis framework at some time. In 10.10 (Yosemite) it is located in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks, whereas in older systems it was in /Library/Frameworks. To ensure compatibility, Apple inserted a symlink at the old location: NyxAudioAnalysis.framework → /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NyxAudioAnalysis.framework. The migration assistant seems to have messed that up somehow. \nSo to fix it you can use Terminal.app: \ncd /Library/Frameworks\nsudo mv NyxAudioAnalysis.framework NyxAudioAnalysis.framework.copy\nsudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/NyxAudioAnalysis.framework NyxAudioAnalysis.framework\n\nwhich does the job.\nConclusion: Copying the directory from some source is working, but it may not last. The potential problem with it is that if Apple should update their library some time you won’t get the changes. This could cause some problems with iPhoto (or other programs) any time in the future. Therefore I suggest to insert the original symbolic link.\n\nA: I was able to find a blog post online where someone had uploaded the missing libraries. I just put them in /Library/Frameworks/ and iPhoto now opens up fine. Here is a link to the blog post:\nhttp://www.sanebutdifferent.com/iphoto-11-nyxaudioanalysis-crash-error\n", "Q: Mac OS X Applications Windows Stack Order When you right click an application in the dock, a list including the opened windows for that application is open, like this: http://cl.ly/image/350Q2J0q0e25\nThe problem is this: I would like to specify the ordering of these windows some way.

Since upgrading to iOS 8, I've noticed that the Events list inside iPhoto is no longer in reverse chronological order. In fact, it's not in any order at all. This makes the Events system almost completely useless for me.\nIs anyone else experiencing this? Is it a bug, or is there a setting I need to configure?\n\nA: It's a bug.\nNo fix at all right now.\nI've tried all the usual suspects, re-order in iPhoto, delete & re-add all my Events, clear & re-sync everything.\nEvents arrive in random order whatever I do… a different random order after each of the attempts to fix.\nThere's been a lot of discussion on the Apple community site about it, no-one's found a fix, the bug is known to have been reported already.\n\nA: in itunes, when you click to add photos you will see it ask if you want all, some, or recent.. click events and add one event at a time. start with the event you want to show first, then add the event you want to add second etc etc. it seems they put events in the order the pictures are placed on the device. so even tho you have them set up in order via the list in itunes, it syncs all the photos randomly putting the events in order they are sent to the device.\n", "Q: MacBook Air running Yosemite won't shut down when external HDD connected My MacBook Air won't shut down when an external hard drive is connected. The screen goes black, and the mouse pointer is still there. I think this started happening when I upgrade to Yosemite. Any suggestions as to how I might fix this?\n\nA: Are you sure something is not still running...or something is preventing the disk from unmounting.\nIf there's a grey circle -- then it might be running fsck on the disk...\nNow, another thread suggested:\n\nStart Up in Verbose Mode using Command-V\nThen issue: sudo shutdown -h now\nAlso, more /var/log/system.log\n\nThis should show you what's occurring as it shuts down.\nThe sudo shutdown -h now is equivalent to the Shut down menu option.\nAlso, try going into Disk Utility and manually click on the Unmount icon.

What setting am I missing?\n\nA: As an addendum to the above, if the Other section is not visible in the sidebar, go to Preferences and select the General icon.\nNow select the Show Birthdays Calendar or Show Holidays Calendar (or both) and close the Preferences pane. The Other section is now added below the iCloud section.\nYou can now right-click in the Other section, select New Calendar and an untitled calendar is created in the On My Mac section above the iCloud section.\nI find this very useful if I need an application to run at a specific time each day on one specific Mac and not on any others. This also prevents alerts from appearing on other devices such as iPhone or iPad where they would have no significance.\n\nA: The other answers didn't work for me until I hid all the other calendar groups by hovering over them to show the hide button. Then I right clicked to create a new calendar.\n\nA: To create local calendar on Yosemite (when no such option is available via File menu) navigate to calendar in Other section in the sidebar, select one and right click, then select New Calendar. This should create calendar in On My Mac section (local).\n\nA: Just had this problem with a new MacBook running Sierra. I tried disabling iCloud Calendars but as soon as it was enabled my local calendars were moved to iCloud.\nFinally was able to do it, by selecting on of the calendars inside Other (i.e. Found in Apps) and then doing File -> New Calendar.\n\nA: If you first turn off your iCloud account using the System Preferences control panel, an \"On My Mac\" option appears in the File > New Calendar menu.

To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap \"General\"\n\n*Tap \"Language & Region\"\n\n*Tap \"iPhone Language\"\n\n*Select \"English (U.K.)\"\n\n\nYour iPhone should reboot and your dictionary should be set to British English. If it doesn't, you may need to reset your dictionary by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap \"General\"\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and tap \"Reset\"\n\n*Tap \"Reset Keyboard Dictionary\"\n\n\nYou can verify that you are running your iPhone with British English as your preferred language as in the main Settings menu you will see an option labelled \"Mobile\" (it is labelled \"Cellular\" in US English).\n\nA: In Settings → General → Language & Region → Preferred Language Order, you have to select English (U.K.) and remove others.\nIn Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards you can select the keyboards languages you want. There is a keyboard called English (UK).\n\nA: You can also just hold the globe button down and choose UK English there. \n\nA: iPhone 8\nRemove and add languages under keyboards.\nThis will give access to the appropriate spelling correction.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, I tried this on an iPhone 8 plus and it made no difference !\nIt still shows \"aeroplane\" spelled as \"airplane\" in the SETTINGS.\n(Unfortunately, I can't reply to the original post as I need 50 reputation points or something :(  )\n", "Q: Is it dangerous to run a GPU benchmark I wanted to see how my new 13\" Retina MacBook Pro performed on GPU stress, so I downloaded some GPU benchmark apps.\nIn one of the apps, I set the resolution to the same as my screen, and I putted antialiasing to the max...\nThen, when I launched it, my computer became (not surprisingly) unresponsive, I did managed to force quit the app though, at which time OS X triggered me an error panel, telling me that there was a graphic error (and I could signal it), but it didn't blocked anything.\nA little bit later, after I ran another benchmark, a small black line appeared briefly on the screen (something like 0.5 seconds) and then disappeared.\nIs it a normal behavior after a high GPU load ? Or should I worry about it ?\nIs it dangerous for the CPU to go to its limits ? (my GPU is an Intel Iris one).\nThank you.\n\nA: I've seen that error a few time on mine since updating to Yosemite. I've taken it in to get checked out and apple didn't find anything when running their tests. One thing I've done to keep it from popping up as much is to do a NVRAM reset. You can do this by restarting before bootup hold command + option P + R till you hear a second startup chime then release. This clears out some video memory and some other minor settings like volume etc. \n", "Q: iMac retina 27\" with Mac OS X Yosemite.

The light is on and it is vibrating as it usually does I had another external drive transferred to this one with all my data on it and now I can't access it.\nWhat can I do to access the drive and data?\n\nA: Open System Information and check the USB bus to see if the drive is recognized on the connection level. If not, you need a new cable or a new drive or a USB port repaired. Try different ports to get a good USB connection.\nThen, you need to use Disk Utility to see if the drive has problems. Once you've verified the USB connection is working, then open Disk Utility and click to unmount any drives using that USB connection (eject removes them - unmount allows diagnostics to finish or run).\nAt that point, you should be able to let the system finish checking the drive and optionally run the verify command.\nOnce you have a more specific failure, post a new question with details on what your situation is.\n", "Q: Avoid stutter when watching Amazon Prime video on Mac Mini 32-bit? I have a Mac Mini that's a few years old.\nI'd like to use it for watching online video, because it's small, we're not using it for anything else, it fits nicely under the TV, and I can connect its video output to the TV. We've got a month's free trial of Amazon Prime Video.\nIt's 32-bit (Intel Core Duo) so it's running Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6), which I understand is the most recent version of OS X that it's possible to upgrade it to. It has 1Gb of ram.\nI've upgraded Flash and downloaded Silverlight and although APV videos won't play on Chrome, they will play on Firefox. Which is ok.\nBut when I play them back I get stuttering. :( Sometimes it's ok for a minute or 2 and then we get a little stutter, other times its stuttering every 10 seconds. It seems to stutter mostly when there's a big change in the image and lots happening in the audio - that could be my imagination.\nTo give video playback the highest priority (the machine is not being used for anything else), I did a renice -20 pid for the Firefox process and for the Silverlight process which it spawned. That didn't seem to help.\nI know that the problem is with this machine (rather than with our internet connection or our router) because I've tried watching the videos on my laptop, connected to the internet in the same way, and that works well.\nI've rebooted the machine and I've made sure there's only 1 logged-in user.\nCan you suggest things I could try in order to make Amazon Prime Video play back without stuttering? Thanks!\nsh-3.2# system_profiler SPHardwareDataType\nHardware:\n\nHardware Overview:\n\n  Model Name: Mac mini\n  Model Identifier: Macmini1,1\n  Processor Name: Intel Core Duo\n  Processor Speed: 1.66 GHz\n  Number Of Processors: 1\n  Total Number Of Cores: 2\n  L2 Cache: 2 MB\n  Memory: 1 GB\n  Bus Speed: 667 MHz\n  Boot ROM Version: MM11.0055.B08\n  SMC Version (system): 1.3f4\n  Serial Number (system): VM65001EW0C\n  Hardware UUID: 00000000-0000-1000-8000-0016CBA7861B\n\n\nA: My guess is that your CPU just isn't up to the task of decoding the stream of data that makes up the video stream for several reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Amazon video is using a somewhat inefficient codec and software stack to deliver the content.\n\n*The software to render the video is likely single threaded on your Mac OS.\n\n*Your CPU has only two cores and at 1.66 GHz of that era isn't keeping up.\n\n*Your desktop size is too large and/or you can't ask the video server to send a smaller picture that can be processed. Each time you double the sides of a rectangle, you have to calculate 4x the pixels. Even reducing from 1080 horizontal pixels to 720 horizontal pixels would drastically reduce the processing power needed to render the video.\n\n\nYou can verify that the CPU is indeed the culprit by rebooting your Mac and opening only the Activity Monitor app and watching the CPU graph. Set the update interval to be 5 seconds in the app and then open your web browser of choice to an empty page. Again, let the CPU settle. Lastly, load the video you want and then pause the stream.\nLooking at the CPU load at that point will let you know if any other process is hitting the CPU in a meaningful way. Anything over 5% would be worrisome from a maximum performance standpoint.\nThen let the video play and watch the CPU allocation. \nKnowing that the CPU is the problem, you can try reducing the screen resolution or putting the browser on an external display VGA or reducing the color depth of the main display might all help or hurt CPU load - so running some controlled tests might get you to acceptable settings. If not, you could get a secondhand iPod touch or iPhone/iPad and probably stream Amazon video inexpensively and far more smoothly than your Mac.\n\nA: It turned out that switching a setting on Amazon's website from the Silverlight player to the Flash player solved the problem.\nFor anyone else with the same problem the setting is on this page:\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201460940&encoding=UTF8&ref=atv_pc_pp_more\nThank you @bmike for your advice nonetheless!\n\nA: I just experienced the same issue for the past week on a mid-2012 quad-core MBPr w/ 16 GB ram.\nTurns out it was caused by a program called Memory Monitor.\nAfter disabling this program the issue stopped and I get smooth video playback.\nUpdate:\nAfter more observation it appears to be a memory issue.  If I spin up a Parallels VM the stutter comes back, but less intense than when Memory Monitor was running.\nMy conclusion at this point is I'm running out of memory (somehow!).  Memory Monitor's reorganization of the system's memory just exasperated the issue.\n", "Q: VLC on windows 8.1 can't open files on iMac I have an iMac running Mavericks. My music files (mp3) are stored on this machine. I also have a windows 8.1 laptop running VLC media player. I can access files on the iMac from the windows machine over my local home network using windows explorer with no problem. However VLC running on my windows 8.1 machine cannot access the files on my imac: I get an error saying \"VLC cannot access the MRL.\"\nUsing VLC I can access and play music files stored on any of my windows machines, so it is not a problem with vlc getting through the firewall on my windows 8.1 machine. It seems the iMac is refusing access to VLC, though it allows access to windows explorer, ping etc.\nHow can I open these files?\nUpdate: I tried different music apps running on my windows 8.1 machine besides VLC. Boom.exe and MPC-HC were not able to play the files stored on the imac (though they could both see and select them) but windows media player could see and successfully play the files.\n\nA: This is not a fix but information sharing.\nMy mavericks Firewall has following settings\n\nUse the + to add and allow connection.\nI set my VLC to Block for demonstration purpose.\n", "Q: Is there an app for manage documents for OS X? I'm searching for an app like iTunes or iPhoto but for documents which manage documents for me.\nI assume the finder itself could manage documents, but please explain how the helpful properties of finder or another app can work more like iTunes and iPhoto on OS X.\n\nA: The closest analog I know of for general purpose document organizing in an \"everything box\" similar to iPhoto/iTunes would be Yojimbo.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/\nIt lets you catalog and organize information in quite powerful ways. Also check out Evernote if you want files to be in the cloud and don't already use a service for syncing. I've heard Together is also worth investigating but never really known anyone that used it or tried it myself.\nFinder is capable of using tags and smart searches, but most people that are inclined to do that have already come up with a folder hierarchy that uses the filesystem for storage and spotlight for indexing files. It really depends on how much time you want to invest in cataloging and the volume and type of files you are organizing.\n\nA: If you're managing a lot of PDFs, I like Papers.  It's intended for researchers to manage research papers.  I've found it handy for managing other sorts of documents.  It lets you specify plenty of metadata, organize documents into collections, and take notes about your documents.  \nIt also sounds like you could use a great primer on using the Finder.  Macworld has a bunch of articles to help you learn more about using the Finder, including Finder 101 (which is super-basic) and Mac essentials: files, the Finder, and search (which introduces you to ideas like Smart Folders and lots of things -- it's a long article, but worth the time investment).  Macworld has lots of other resources.  Your question is pretty broad; if you update, I might be able to provide some more specific recommendations.\n", "Q: Mobile Safari Redirects to App Store According to several news stories, the iOS 8 betas included a new feature:\n\nSafari now blocks ads from automatically redirecting to the App Store without user interaction.\n\n(The last link makes it look like the feature did get into the released version of iOS 8, not just the betas.)\nHowever, certain sites (with ads) are still managing to open the App Store on my iPhone 5S.\nIs there a way to ensure this setting is enabled?\n\nA: Unfortunately regardless of Apple's efforts to curb websites redirecting users to the iTunes App Store, it still regularly occurs.\nThere is no 'setting' which enables / disables this 'feature', my only recommendation would be to ensure the \"Fraudulent Website Warning\" is switched on, having the \"Block Cookies\" setting on anything but 'always allow' and also testing weather turing off JavaScript support (under Advanced) helps in any way.\n", "Q: What are the differences between Applescripts saved as *.scpt and *.applescript? It seems to me that those scripts that are saved as *.applescript are always meant to be the raw, uncompiled text while those that are saved as *.scpt can be either the raw text or the compiled program.\nWhat advantages/disadvantages are there to using each extension?\nAn ancillary question: is there an analogous extension to *.applescript for the new JavaScript for Automation (JXA) language? Perhaps *.jxa?\n\nA: .scpt is in binary. .applescript is in text.\nYou can use Spotlight/Finder's find function to search for words in .applescript. You cannot do this with .scpt.\nSince .scpt is already compiled, it's quicker to launch.\nMy favorite thing about .applescript is that I can write that a script that read/write onto itself, so that variables are saved for next run without creating a separate file to house the variables. \n", "Q: iPhone 6 Plus Wireless connection problem My brother bought an iPhone 6 Plus, and it has a small problem.

I bought a mid-2014 MBP Retina (activated on 30/09/2014) from a friend and did a re-installation of Mavericks, then upgraded to Yosemite right after the re-installation (without associating the mac to my Apple account. I only did that after upgrading to Yosemite.)\nNow I realise that I cannot get the iWork and iLife apps for free (I should have associated the mac to my Apple account and use it to get iWork and iLife before upgrading, right?).\nIs there anyway to get that apps without re-install everything ?\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: It is not about iCloud account but about Mac Apps store logged in account and upgrading said apps under it.\nIf you have iLife and iWork trials installed under Mavericks you will get them associated to your Apple ID logged into App Store. Can't say for sure but maybe you have to update them for this. Don't have to download them all the way though when they started updating.\nAnd no there is no way to do it except having Mavericks. You might use another Mac with Mavericks for this (provided it doesn't have iLife and iWork already installed of course) or you might install Mavericks on your Mac — you can create a temporal partition for this, you can use external drive, USB or even SD card for this too.\n", "Q: What is the relation between water damage and a cracked iPhone screen? This morning I took my iphone 5c to the genius bar and they refused to repair my cracked screen of the iphone initially agreeing to repair and then backing off citing water damage.\nMy iPhone is in standard 1-year warranty yet, so I don't understand what the connection between water damage and a cracked screen is. \nCan someone explain Apple's reasoning or decision?\n\nA: Just like an automotive repair service, some damage costs more to repair than it would cost to make a new vehicle. In car terms, your phone is \"totaled\" and the physical damage to the screen alone lies outside the warranty.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could buy a new phone from the vendor and then submit that cost to your insurance company if it covers the accidental (or not) damage to your property for reimbursement.\n\n*You could ask Apple why they aren't offering you a \"partial repair\" - where you acknowledge that some damage is present and want a limited repair and then forgo the warranty on the repaired phone. My guess is they decided that all Apple repaired phones need to pass all tests and they literally can't even know how much liquid damage has spread without entirely reworking the phone.\n\n*You could seek repair from a company or person other than Apple.\n\n\nLiquid damage is expensive to even diagnose since the small cracks in an iPhone ensure that water can and will go everywhere. If corrosive salts are coating the electronics you now have a safety and reliability concern. The cost to inspect and test every single part is akin to painstakingly refurbishing a 1971 Hemi 'Cuda convertible that you found rusting in a field. In that case, there were external factors that made the cost to refurbish the product economically or socially pleasing.\n\nA: There might be corrosion inside the device making it a pain or very expensive to replace parts which can potentially start to rot.\nOnce the water indicator in your device (sim card slot) has been colored ree, it will void all warranty.\nYou can still try to call Apple and explain the problem and try for the best\n\nA: bmike pretty much approached the reason. Here's the actual reason in simple terms:\nWhen Apple does a repair, they give you back a product that they guarantee is working. They stand behind it. Even if it's out of warranty, they give you a 90 day warranty. With liquid damage, for the reasons bmike stated in his answer, they CANNOT guarantee that you have a fully working to factory standards and longevity phone.  For this reason they decline to do the repair.\n\nA: This is illegal, if they refused to repair it because of ‘water damage’. Apple lost a huge lawsuit in Australia wherein they had to admit that their moisture sensors can turn red/pink just from humidity and not necessarily because a device has actually been in water. Because of this admission they are required by law to repair or replace any device which is malfunctioning under warranty regardless of the color of the sensor. If you do some google-fu, you can find documentation of water damage not voiding warranty on Apple’s own site. \n", "Q: Missing menu items from the Apple Menu Somehow in the past 24 hours, I have only a basic menu for the Apple Menu and my early 2011 MBP running Yosemite 10.10.1 also always starts up in the Simple Finder.

My question is fairly simple, seeing as iPod has full support for executing JavaScript (proven my bookmarklets (See below) why doesn't it have a \"dev tools\" option, or at least a JS console?

You should see a switch for \"Web Inspector\". Switch it on.\n\n*On your Mac, go into the Preferences within Safari and on the Advanced tab you should see a tick box for \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\". Tick it.\n\n*Now if you open the Develop menu within Safari on your Mac you should now see a submenu for your iOS device listing the available \"inspectable applications\". I've only seen Safari on this list, but I assume other applications that use UIWebViews are inspectable too.\n\n\nArguably more useful than having web development tools built into the devices themselves.\n\nA: Well, we can only speculate as to why Apple doesn't include a JavaScript console but we can make some assumptions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen real-estate is limited on a mobile device, and it would be cumbersome to use (imagine trying to code with an iPhone keyboard).\n\n*Mobile devices are, in general, not intended for web development. Apple wants to keep their UI/UX as streamlined as possible. Including a feature which, in Apple's opinion, is unnecessary, works against this goal.\n", "Q: Restoring data from both an iCloud and iTunes backup I backup my iPhone to iTunes manually about once a week, and backup to iCloud automatically every night, when I charge my iPhone.\nIf I want to restore from an iTunes backup, then I just connect my iPhone to my Mac and hit \"Restore\". It will restore the device to exactly the same condition as the last backup, including all media, etc. because all that media (music, photos, app data) is stored on my Mac.\nHowever, if I restore from my iCloud backup, then what gets restored? And what doesn't? My iCloud backup is about 2.5 GB, significantly smaller than the 50 GB or so that I am currently using on my iPhone (mostly music and photos). So clearly a lot of things are missing, mostly photos, since music and apps can be grabbed directly from Apple's servers since one song here is the same as the same song there.\nSo how would I go about also restoring photos after I restore a backup from iCloud?\n\nA: *\n\n*First of all, I see that I can restore those: Notes, Reminder, Apple Mail, Apple Contacts, Apple Calendar, Photos. \n\n*Then, you can also restore MANUALLY for those contents: Contacts, Calendars, Bookmarks. \n\n\n\nPS: I'm using IP 5S. ^^ \n", "Q: Disable notification center in Yosemite I tried several solutions to disable completely the notification center in Yosemite.\nFor example, see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57477/104881 or https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/139171/104881.\nThese solutions disable the notification panel, but, in Yosemite, the notification icon of the menu bar is still there.\nHow can I remove the menu bar icon ?\nI know the bartender software can do that but I am looking for a solution which does not require addind another app.\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have already tried to remove NotificationCenter.app in /System/Library/CoreServices.\n\n*I also tried the following command:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist; killall NotificationCenter\nThese two techniques remove the notifications but do not remove the icon.\n\nA: Like the spotlight search icon, the notification centre icon cannot be removed from the status bar using OS X. You should use the bartender program to hide that icon.\nIt works with Yosemite and has the feature you seek:\n\nWith Bartender you can hide or move the Notification Center menu bar item, but still use Notification Center.\n\n\nA: Solution (not perfect because it leaves the space of the icon in the menu bar, but it's always better than nothing), type this in the Terminal and confirm with your password :\nsudo rm System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/Resources/menuitemNormal.pdf\n\nAnd reboot your computer (or close and reopen your session).\nExplanation :\nI was searching for the same thing, so I searched where the file image of the icon is in the system, and it was not hard to find it.\nFirst, I looked for something related to the user interface in the Activity Monitor, and I found SystemUIServer. Next, I searched its emplacement in the hard drive, I used Show Package Contents, and I looked in the Resources folder. Bingo, the icon was this pdf file !

I do not have iTunes match.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can change the default location for the main mp3 file storage for iTunes, but not [easily] the location of the database files.\nIt is far simpler in the long term to leave the database in its default location -\nC:\\Users\\[your name]\\Music\\iTunes\nThis is also a folder you should recover from your old machine & transfer to the new one, otherwise you will have all the music but none of the playlists, play counts etc etc. & will have to re-import all your existing tunes.\nYou can, however, easily change the main 'content' storage location.\nGo to Edit menu > preferences > Advanced\nThe first section is 'iTunes Media Folder Location' with a file path beneath [presumably currently set to the default location mentioned above] & a Change… button to the right. This will allow you to redirect to your non-standard location.\n\nIf you still have the original database successfully recovered from your old machine, then to save a lot of additional effort, make sure you put your content folder in \"the same place\" as it used to be on the old machine, i.e., if it was in D:\\iTunes remote folder then put it in the same place again, otherwise it will lose the connection to your existing tunes & again have to be rebuilt.\n", "Q: How to do I keep music on an iPod when I have no access to the iTunes account that it was added with? I have a rather difficult question. When I got my iPod I didn't have my own laptop, so my brother set up a joint account for both of our iPod's on his laptop - using his email and his personal account.\nUnfortunately my brother has recently passed away and I have no access to his laptop, email or iTunes account. \nSo I'm not sure how to keep the music that is currently on the iPod (which I want to keep for sentimental reasons) while I attempt to sync it with iTunes with a new account (I want to add some music). Is there a way to do this - if so, how?\n\nA: You could try, the windows only application, MediaMonkey (mediamonkey.com). This may help you as it used to be able to get around the itunes media controls... I have not used it for a while, so it may have changed (or Apple may have changed something to stop MediaMonkey from working as it used to).\nWith MediaMonkey you may be able to save the music already on your ipod. Once you have saved the music (safely - check it first) to a PC, then sync to itunes and then after you have sync'd it with itunes (which is pretty much guaranteed to wipe the original music), you could then re-add it...\n", "Q: Is there any app to make/receive calls on iphone from another non-apple device? I have an iPhone that I use mainly to connect to internet and another device that simply makes calls and not have much features. It becomes frustrating using two devices when answering calls. There is a feature called \"Call Divert\" which charges for each call diverted, and using a Bluetooth headset is inevitable especially when you are having much less call frequency. So is there any app, without the need to be JAILBROKEN to connect the iPhone with other Bluetooth enabled device and simply act as a sound pathway so that calls and music on the other phone can be heard on this iPhone. More like using an iPhone as Bluetooth headset. \n\nA: Yes, on your iPad or iPhone go to settings > facetime > choose the caller id option for your phone number, then an option will appear to allow iphone cellular calls.\n", "Q: iCloud Drive taking up space on local drive? My computer seems to be keeping a local copy of my iCloud Drive folder. Is there any way to disable this? \nI know this because in my \"Library\" folder, there is another folder called \"Mobile Documents\" that links to the contents in my iCloud Drive folder. \nAlso, when I click on \"About This Mac\", under \"Storage\", it includes the iCloud Drive folder's contents.\nIs there a way for me to not keep a local copy of the iCloud Drive folder? I don't want it taking up space on my hard drive...\n\nA: No, I don't believe this can be done.

If so, what is the easiest way to get an up-to-date version of etags, to use with Emacs from http://emacsformacosx.com/?    \nI am using:\nGNU Emacs 24.4.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0, NS apple-appkit-1265.21) of 2014-10-20 on builder10-9.porkrind.org.\nYosemite 10.10.1\n\nA: Emacs from http://emacsformacosx.com/ comes with a recent etags:\n$find /Applications/Emacs.app -name etags\\*\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-i386-10_5/etags\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-powerpc-10_4/etags\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_5/etags\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_7/etags\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_9/etags\n[...]\n\nIt's the corresponding version to emacs:\n$ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_9/etags --version\netags (GNU Emacs 24.4)\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n\nA: Would using ctags from homebrew be a sufficient replacement? It is quite up to date (Exuberant Ctags 5.8) and trivial to install if you have Xcode already and then install the brew package manager. It's manual page clearly indicates that it works with Emacs.\n\nA: The reason why etags is out of date is that the emacs version installed on a Mac by default is also severely out of date. \nEmacs comes with etags, so when you install emacs via homebrew, you get a recent etags. But I would expect that emacsforosx also comes with etags. \nI assume that, if you look in the application folder, you will find etags somewhere there.

I'm trying to get the Mindstorms software on my MacBook, and this is part of the requirements:\nMac 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 with the latest service packs\n\nWhat are the service packs it is talking about? Were they on older versions of OS X, but not on the current version? I'm confused because I thought service packs were a Microsoft thing.\nEDIT: I'm currently running 10.10.1 (Yosemite).\n\nA: Whoever wrote the requirements probably is more familiar with Windows terminology. While they aren't called \"service packs\", every major release of OS X (such as 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8) has had multiple \"minor\" or \"point\" releases containing improvements and fixes. See this list for details of release dates. For the example given, 10.6.8, 10.7.5, and 10.8.5 would be the most-current releases of the major versions mentioned.\nThese minor updates have historically been made available through the Software Update item under OS X's Apple menu, and, since either 10.7 or 10.8, are now available through the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Service Pack is Microsoft naming convention for a major update pack which incorporates a plethora of minor security and other updates in one single installer.\nA rough Apple equivalent are the latest Combo Updates:\nMac OS X 10.6.8 Client Combo Update\nMac OS X 10.7.5 Client Combo Update\nMac OS X 10.8.5 Client Combo Update \n", "Q: \"Suspicious Activity Might Have been Detected\" malware in Safari or other browsers Did you navigate to a page that produced a popup that says (among other things)...\nSuspicious Activity Might Have been Detected\n...and then asks you to call a toll free number?

I have backups of my personal files more unfortunately I do not have the system.\nIs there any way to install Mavericks again through a partition of an external HD?\nI already have this HD two images of the maverick acquired in apple store. One is the .dmg extension and the other is in .iso extension that I converted in linux.\nIs there any solution?\n\nA: You're getting the error message because OS X Mavericks isn't available for download by the Recovery HD anymore, deleted in favor of Yosemite. Your best bet is to use Internet Recovery. Make sure you're on a decent Internet connection (Ethernet is best, if possible) and follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Immediately after hearing the Mac boot chime, hold down Command+Option+R – if you see the Apple logo you waited too long and need to reboot and try again\n\n*Eventually, you’ll see the familiar “OS X Utilities” screen, choose “Reinstall OS X” to begin the re-installation process of the Mac operating system\n\n*Select the destination and complete the re-installation (or installation) of OS X as usual\nSource\n\nA: Your first option is to go to an Apple Store and use an installer CD. Put the CD in your Mac's disk reader and boot from that. To do this, press the power button and hold the option, or alt, key. Select the CD (it will have an icon) and follow on-screen instructions. If your Mac does not have a disk reader, you will need to use an external one.\n\n\nYour second option is to put the Mavericks installer on an external drive.\nYou will need another Mac for this.\nYou can find similar instructions on the internet by searching for\nmac os mavericks installer usb\n\nThese instructions involve erasing disks. Make sure you are using the correct disk for each step. If you are unsure of what you are doing, ask for help. To avoid erasing the wrong disks, make sure you only have one disk plugged in at a time and never touch \"Macintosh HD\" on the Mac you are using to format the disk.\nOption 1 to put installer on external drive:\nTaken from this answer by dewaldcels\n1. Download Mavericks for the App store.\n2. Plug in the USB drive you want to boot from (has to be 8GB or more)\n3. Then from the Terminal app run this command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\nIn this command it says --volume  /Volumes/MyVolume. You need to replace MyVolume with the name of your disk. To get the name, go to Finder and find your disk. The name of the disk is the name you need to put instead of MyVolume. If your disk is partitioned, use the name of the partition you want to use.\nI HAVE NOT TESTED THIS. THIS COULD ERASE THE PARTITION, SO USE ONE YOU DON'T NEED.\nThis will take a while.\nOption 2 to put installer on external drive:\n1. Borrow another Mac (from friend or Apple Store)\n2. Get a copy of Mavericks (either from a backup or App Store or an actual Apple Store) [1]\n3. Right click the installer app and click \"Show Package Contents\"\n4. Find InstallESD.dmg inside\n5. Open InstallESD.dmg\n6. Open Disk Utility [2]\n7. Attach a USB/SD card/external hard drive that you are not using with at least 8GB of memory\n8. Reformat it to use the GUID Partition Scheme and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format [3]\n9. Select InstallESD.dmg in the sidebar on the left\n10. On the right, click the tab labeled \"Restore\"\n11. In the sidebar on the left you will see the external storage device you attached in Step 7. It will have the name of the type of device you used [4]. Under this you will see the name of the partition (the name you see in Finder). It must be at least 8GB [5]. Drag it into the right side into the box labeled \"Destination\"\n12. Click \"Restore\". This process will take a while. The disk must be formatted correctly. See [3]\n13. Eject your drive\n14. Plug it into your other Mac (the one you want Mavericks on)\n15. Press the power button and hold the option key (also known as alt key)\n16. Select the partition that you just reformatted. It should say \"Install Mac OS X 10.9\" or something similar.\n17. Follow onscreen instructions to install Mavericks on your hard drive (Macintosh HD)\n\nNotes\n[1] The name of the app is \"Install Mac OS X Mavericks.app\". You might have backed it up using Time Machine. If not, download it from the App Store. Otherwise, ask a friend or an Apple Store employee.\n[2] Ways to open Disk Utility:\n1. Open Spotlight (click the magnifying glass in the top right corner or use a keyboard shortcut), type \"disk utility\" and it should be the first result)\n2. Open Launchpad and search \"Disk Utility\" (OS 10.8+) or open the Utilities folder and click \"Disk Utility\"\n3. Open Finder, click the \"Go\" menu, and click \"Utilities\". Then open Disk Utility.app\n[3] Warning: reformatting a partition erases all its contents.\nSelect your disk in the sidebar. Click the \"Partition\" tab. At the bottom, find the text \"Partition Map Scheme\". If it says \"GUID Partition Table\" use Method 2 below. Otherwise, use Method 1.\nMethod 1 (erases disk):\nWARNING This erases the entire disk.\nSelect your disk in the sidebar. On the right, under \"Partition\", click the \"Partition Layout\" drop-down menu and select \"1 partition\". To the right, select the \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" format.

Click the \"Erase\" tab, select the \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" format, and click \"Erase...\".\n[4] If you used an SD card, it will say \"SDXC Reader Card Media\" or something similar. If you used a hard drive or a USB, it will have its capacity and the manufacturer, or something similar.\n[5] To see the size of your partition, select your disk in the sidebar on the left. Under the \"Partition\" tab, make sure the text box labeled \"Size\" contains a number greater than 8 and says \"GB\" to the right of it. If it does not have enough memory, you might have to use a different disk or re-partition and reformat it (see [3] above)\n", "Q: OSX hangs on startup after large file search caused a crash (Mavericks 10.9.5) Well, my computer won't startup.

It wasn't too much and I turned off the computer right way. The computer works perfectly fine, but after I log in the keyboard and trackpad stop working.\nDoes anyone have any clue on what is going on?\n\nA: As physical connectors heat and cool, they may loose contact with what they are connected to.  Rather than logging in immediately upon boot up, let the computer get up to temperature.  In other words, wait 5-10 minutes.  Can you log in at that point?  If not, the increased heat from normal startup may have exposed some hardware damage done by the liquid.\n\nA: After letting it siting for a couple of weeks the computer started working normal again. So I'd say that in cases like that it would be a good idea to let the computer off as long as possible and at least 72h.\n(The computer wasn't actually mine and the guy turned it on after 3 or 4 hours).\n\nA: I have had the same problem (only without the liquid) and I have find the solution... I was ready to restaure an old back up from time machin. To do so, I have before '''clean the desktop'''. I classified and '''removed all the desktop documents and restart the computer'''.

I am running Snow leopard 10.6.8 and know I can upgrade to Yosemite but have my hesitations after reading many comments on blogs. I've started to notice the effects of Snow Leopard being fazed out and want to upgrade but don't want to kill my machine while doing with a OS thats too much for it.

Any thoughts would be most appreciated!\nThanks\nPaul\n\nA: I actually have the very same machine. I started with Snow Leopard, since it originally had 1GB of RAM. After a bit of playing, I decided I liked the newer UI better and upgraded to Lion. Lion is a LOT better on this machine, very snappy, and has support for newer software from the Mac App Store. Unfortunately, some pre-Unibody MacBooks CANNOT be upgraded past Lion without hacks. Main reason being the graphics unable to keep up with the later 'beauty' introduced into the operating system.\n\nA: I think 10.7-10.9 are all about the same on that machine so I don't see why not to install 10.9 Mavericks since it is latest and most polished of them with Aqua UI.\nYosemite while having some nice UI enchancement has some quirks regarding redraw speed.\nAnd is clearly not as polished as Mavericks.\nFor great speedup you might consider buying an SSD though. If you don't use Superdrive then you might just replace it with 9.5mm PATA to SATA Optibay and save on SSD size. If you go this way install HDD into Optibay adapter and SSD in place of HDD.\n", "Q: Alternatives of BitThief to Download Torrent Files Sequentially I have reasons to modify my Java 6 (legacy) runtime resulting at the torrent client BitThief failed to run.

I was reading previous post on calibrating touch screen and I tried a couple ideas... It mentioned something about it being in the front panel which I just had replaced so I'm wondering if I got a faulty repair or if it's something else entirely? \n\nA: yes - you should head back to the vendor that performed the repair as soon as practical and ask them to have a look at the device - assist with calibration and or perform the repair again if it's not working.\nMost locales have a short period where any work is warranted, so be sure to get something in writing from the vendor if they tell you they can't support their work.\nHopefully it will be something they have seen before and know how to remedy and/or reach an agreement that is satisfactory to you both.\n", "Q: Installing ML 10.8 Using Internet Recovery freezes during install process I changed my Mac HDD because the other one was corrupted.

Otherwise, you’ll boot directly into OS X at startup without being prompted for the EFI password. \nTo re-enable a login password:\nOpen System Preferences. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select Users & Groups > Login Options > Automatic Login: OFF\n", "Q: How do I properly force osx to reload the Info.plist file of an application? On Yosemite 10.10, I was trying to use defaults to modify the Info.plist file of an app, but after such command, osx does not reload modified Info.plist.\nI've tried to move the app around and reboot, as mentioned somewhere else as a way to force osx to reload Info.plist, but failed.\nSo here's the problem, How do I force osx to reload the Info.plist file of an app?\n\nSpecifically here is what I want to achieve:\nCurrently the flash in Firefox runs in low resolution when in fullscreen mode, to fix this I need to make the Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container.app HiDPI compatible.\nAccording to this, after this command:\ndefaults write /Application/Firefox/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container.app/Contents/Info.plist  NSHighResolutionCapable true\nI should be able to uncheck the \"Open in Low Resolution\" checkbox. But no, modifed plugin-container.app still has a greyed-out checkbox in its info panel. Rebooting does not solve the problem.\nHere's the weird part: I moved the modified plugin-container.app to somewhere else, then I was able to uncheck that checkbox. But I moved it back and that checkbox became greyed-out again.\nAn work-around I found is\n\n\n*\n\n*copy another app to /Application/Firefox/Contents/MacOS/ and renamed it to plugin-container.app (I call this the \"fake plugin-container.app\"), \n\n*then replace fake one with the modified one.\n\n\nIn this way I can have the \"Open in Low Resolution\" checkbox back and am able to uncheck it, but system doesn't update the app icon after replacing, so now the app icon of the modified plugin-container.app is still the one of the fake plugin-container.app. \nA problem is fixed but another is created.\nSo what is the proper way to have the system reload the Info.plist?\n\nA: I've just had this issue as we had to change Info.plist in our app and it failed to run for anyone who updated from the previous version of the app. The easiest way I found of clearing the Info.plist cache was simply to move the file to a different directory, then move it back. I'm still hoping to find a way of doing it pro grammatically, but this should do for your case.\n", "Q: Trouble with iCloud signing request How can I keep my iPad from asking me to log in to iCloud?\nI don't want anything to do with iCloud and I don't want to be constantly hounded by Apple to log in.\n\nA: Try under Settings > iCloud > Sign Out at the bottom of the page.

Every single device I came across has sequential bluetooth and wifi mac addresses. Except for one device and I think it might be jailbroken I am not sure (it was a friend's phone). Is this always correct? Every iPhone/iPad has sequential mac addresses except for the jailbroken ones? If not is there a pattern between bluetooth and wifi mac address?\n\nA: I imagine this is the case: iPhone and iPad are using an integrated chipset (like this: http://www.broadcom.com/products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions/BCM4334) supporting both Wifi and Bluetooth. And as both of them are on the same chip the manufacturer could be just incrementing the MACs. \nHowever the question is why you ask this - if you want to use this information to check if it's the same device: don't, as there is no guarantee that it will always be this way.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade mac mini I have a Mac Mini, running OS X 10.7.5, and I try to upgrade it, but I cannot for some reason (in short - I want to install the new XCode and code in Swift).\nWhen I click the \"Free upgrade\" button nothing happens (pic below). I have triple checked Little Snitch that nothing is blocking the App store or something similar, but found nothing.\nAny suggestions.\n\n\nA: Look up your model here.\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html\nThen, scroll down to the section marked \"Maximum MacOS:\", it's towards the bottom on the right.\nOne of my Mac Minis is the early 2009 Core2Duo model, which is the oldest Mini which supports Yosemite.  If you have a model which is older than 2009, it will only support Lion (Core2Duo), Snow Leopard (CoreDuo/CoreSolo), or Leopard (PowerPC).\n\nA: Try searching for 'Yosemite' in the Mac App Store, and install it directly from there. This is the same procedure as upgrading.\n\nA: There is one simple way to find out if you have a real 2009 model. How many USB ports do you have on the back of your Mac mini. If you have 5 USB ports, you have the 2009 Mac mini and I've put Yosemite on 8 of them so far this year. Go on your 2009 Mac mini and click the black apple (top left of the screen), About this Mac, get more info, look for video or graphics. If you have 256MB video you're fine. 2008 and prior Mac minis only have 64MB of video, that's why, even with a core 2 duo CPU, they can't go past Lion. \nSource: We take 2006 core solos and upgrade them to Core2Duo machines that can now take 4GB of ram and thus put Lion on them, which at least does have iCloud support.\n", "Q: How to use OSX to create a bootable USB key to install Windows 8.1 on a PC I have a PC laptop without OS and I would like to install Windows 8.1 on it.  \nHow can I prepare a bootable Windows USB key in Yosemite?  \nI have to use OSX to prepare the bootable USB Key, as I have no Windows machine to create it on.\nIs it possible?

Can I safely remove them or repair the OS ? \nAny suggestions how to deal with the problem are welcome.\n\nA: \"Usually I would do a clean install\" - this is why clean installs are the best way. The time saved by doing an upgrade-install is often negated by the time spent troubleshooting afterwards.\nIt may be worth running the latest version of Onyx and clearing out both system and user caches, but I'd probably be more inclined to spend the time letting Time Machine backup my home folder while I download the Yosemite installer and make a USB installer from it.\nUSB install instuctions for anyone in a similar situation...\nGet an 8GB USB stick, label it Untitled - you will need to modify the command below if using a different volume name.\nDownload the 10.10 installer but don't let it run.\nEnter the following command in Terminal\nsudo /Applications/\"Install OS X Yosemite.app\"/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/\"Install OS X Yosemite.app\" --nointeraction\n\nWait for the magic to happen. You can then boot from the USB, erase your HD and perform a clean install which works as it should. You can then forget about your existing issues and move on.\nIt's not a solution to your issue but it may prove quicker doing this than waiting for a proper answer, particularly if time is an issue...\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" wont connect to wifi My Macbook Pro was broken and I had to fix it at a Apple support.  \nAfterwards, I noticed that the wifi symbol is not showing up on top of the upper task bar.\nI opened system preferences and went to network, & noticed that the wifi and the bluetooth tab is gone, it shows only ethernet and firewire, so I set a service order and no wifi tab pops up, only the ethernet tab and the firewire tab. \n\nA: *\n\n*At the lower left corner of the Network page in System preference, there's a \"+\" button. \n\n*If you click it, you will have a drop-down window asking you how you'd like to create a new network service.\n\n*From there you should be able to select \"Wi-Fi\" as its interface, and give that service a name.\n\n*Then click \"create\", and you should have the \"Wi-Fi\" tab back.\n\n*Then in the Wi-Fi tab, at the bottom there's checkbox \"Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar\", check it and the Wi-Fi symbol will be in the menubar.\n\n\nAfter all these steps you should be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks just as you usually do.\n", "Q: Playing and editing DV-AVI files on a Mac I have loads of video files that I have transferred from MiniDV tapes and onto my computer.

But there is a problem. The files are there, but won't open on the Mac. They play fine on all my PCs.\nWhat do we do? Is this a file type incompatibility issue, or a software issue, or what? I was under the impression that the files on MiniDV tapes are natively DV-AVI (or is this wrong?). Do you have to convert these to MOV or something else while transferring if they are going to be used on a Mac? What do we do? \n\nA: Handbrake can convert almost any movie file to MP4, which then works fine on everything Apple.\n\nA: VLC can play almost everything, DV files included.\nYou can check supported formats here.\nTo edit this kind of videos you can use iMovie from Apple. \n", "Q: dnsextd messages in console I'm running OS X 10.10.1 and keep getting thousands of lines like the following in the system console log.\n12/16/14 2:57:02.937 PM dnsextd[9384]: ConnectToServer - 10 failed attempts.

How is this even possible? How am I even supposed to shop for a new dock reliably if my dock dies?\n\nA: The problem will lie with the dock disk-controllers and the method they use when translating the hard disk layout. I recently serviced an HP NX7400 laptop and the BIOS has two different modes for dealing hard disk translation - LBA Assist and Bit-shift. \nBoth work, but if a drive is formatted using one method it will not be recognised if the other option is then selected after partitioning and formatting.\nThe acid test would be to format both disks, one on each dock, and then hook the drives up directly to a Mac.

I am doing my very first in-house server reset and wipe since graduating from school and I am in over my head. I know I am a noob at it but I am THE I.T. GUY at my office so I am stuck doing this job....\nI did my homework as usual and made sure to follow all steps correctly for my mac mini server at the office. It is the kind with no DVD drive therefore I am relying on attaining my OSX 10.8.5 from apple via the internet. We had a time capsule used as a base station for our office WIFI and since I have begun this project we are without internet and my colleagues are frustrated. I badly need this problem resolved today.\nTo wipe and reset, I...\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut Down The Mac Mini\n\n*Held Command + R until The \"Connecting To Apple\" screen came up with a spinning world. When I started this all the time capsule was causing me huge problems as it wanted to connect to apple for the OSX download via WIFI.... which cant work since our office WIFI is infact the Time Capsule... So I now have all connections unplugged and the direct modem connection into the server and FINALLY I have the option to do the install via LAN direct connection.\n\n*Clicked on Disk Utility, this is where I get confused. I did what I was told, I clicked on my Macintosh HD of 996.8GB size and erased the data. However, there are somehow two other RAID drives showing up here each their own 1TB slot. Was I supposed to erase all of those also? I did only what the online tutorials said to do which was remove the Macintosh HD data. I picked the fast option that wipes in like 4 mins instead of 2.5 hours.\n\n*Waited until drives were wiped and then exited out of the utility program and back to the main screen to then click on Reinstall OSX. This installed with no warning messages and then rebooted my server for me.\n\n*Once it reloaded back up this is the message I get, which launches into an infinite loop of restarting my machine from an internal error to then let me know the same error occured, to then restart all over again....\n\n\n\nCan any one offer a new graduate into the field a bit of help here? I am a great programmer, but a noob server admin.\nUPDATE 1\nSince this post I have had a bit of help but still no luck. I have now tried the OSX reinstall option three times total. There is a raid set running on two other 1 TB drives other than my Macintosh GB HD drive that used to be my main drive. I am not sure if I am supposed to remove or erase these drives and try again?... As you can see its not my main drive that has the raid setup. Its two seperate drives each with a different raid I think. My main drive used to be Macintosh HD.\n\nUPDATE 2\nThere was no option to remove the extra drive partitions in the RAID since the minus button, the delete button, the erase button and all the HD verify/repair options are ALL greyed out :(\n\nA: In case anyone has searched this and had the same problem as me here was the problem. \nAfter a trip in to the apple store and some work on my own It turned out to be partly a broken sata cord inside the mini as well as the raid partition setup. Once the apple store employees helped me find the sata cable that was causing the error I realized the final problem was that one of the raid slices was set as a promoted drive.\nThe reason I couldn't tell this was the actual problem was an unrelated separate problem which turned out to be a broken sata cable. Once that was replaced it was fairly easy to see that one of the raid slices needed to be demoted in order to remove both partitions and truly wipe the HDD. \n", "Q: How to enable writing to coreduetd.log In Yosemite, there is a log file here:\n/private/var/log/coreduetd.log\n\n...but it's always empty.\nHow do I make the system write events to it, assuming there are any?\n\nA: Unless you know that you've tinkered with the permissions on the file, it should be:\n\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  0 Oct 18 11:02 /private/var/log/coreduetd.log\n\nThis logfile is empty on the 5 Yosemite Macs I have access to.\n", "Q: How do you get the internal drive to show up when you're reinstalling?

You can do so by pressing the home- and power button for 10-15 second. You can release the buttons once the iPod is shut down.\nPreforming this reset will have no effect on your settings and data on the iPod. \nWhen this does not help, iTunes normally gives an error.

down what would be causing this kind of activity.  I thought it might be a passing issue, but it has been ongoing for several hours now.  Is there a way to get a close peek at what is evoking Spotlight activity such as this insomuch that I can isolate the process that is evoking this behavior?\nI was hoping that I could leverage 4317356 since that number or ID appears consistently over this period of time, but it does not seem to relate to any PIDs or other identifiers that I've hunted for thus far.\n\nA: The command:\nmdutil -a -s\n\nwill help you locate on which particular filesystem mds_store is looping on error.\nFor example:\n/Volumes/flamme 1 250 Go/Backups.backupdb:\n        Error: unexpected indexing state.  kMDConfigSearchLevelTransitioning\n\n\nA: mds_stores indicates, that your Spotlight is running wild. This is a known issue on OS X Mavericks and others.\nThere is an article by 9to5Mac How to: Get Spotlight processes back under control when CPU usage goes crazy which says that you should do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Spotlight off with  \nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\n\n*Delete the Spotlight index with\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences/Spotlight/Privacy and disable all folders with often changing content by dragging them into privacy. (Backup, Dropbox and similar)\n\n*Turn Spotlight on again with\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\n\n*Inspect /System/Library/Spotlight/ for ‘Plug-ins’ which could cause some havok with often changing content. Put them into other location and start investigating with mdimport.\n\n*Turn indexing of pure Backup-Volumes to off with\nsudo mdutil -i off /Mountpoint/Volumename\n\n\n*Wait for OS X Update, reverse steps 1-6, check Activity Monitor, and hopefully don't have to do steps 1-6 again.\n\nA: I assume you've tried Force Quit in Activity Monitor? There are some errant processes now and then in Yosemite, less so as the Betas go on. The information there will of course give you an idea what's going on. If this is Spotlight, you could have it index nothing ... and any of the basic OS X utilities will delete the current index and rebuild a fresh one - and I'm sure there's a terminal command for this.\n", "Q: Mac Mini private network I am trying to set up a very simple network using a Netgear 5 port Gigabit switch, a Mac Mini, a Seagate Central 4Tb NAS and an Apple TV to serve movies to my Samsung TV.\nI followed a guide on WikiHow, connected up all the devices, set the IP of the Mac manually and assumed that would be that.\nI am far from expert in this area so as I cannot see anything under \"shared\" in finder I am now at a loss as to what to try. Is there something I need to do to tell the Mac what is there? I tried \"connect to server\" but none appear to be there.\nThe 3 lights on the switch corresponding to the ports connected are green and flash occasionally so they appear to be connected. I do not have an internet router where the devices will be deployed hence the wired solution with switch.\n\nA: I didn't see you mention iTunes at all in your post.  iTunes is essential.\nUnfortunately, AFAIK, you can no longer just \"share\" movies from iTunes to ATV.  You have to turn on Home Sharing, and I believe this requires a live internet connection.  Both iTunes and ATV log into Home Sharing, and everything loaded in iTunes is available on the ATV.\nIf you do not have an internet connection in this setup (and can't/won't add one), you can setup Airplay Mirroring on the Mac mini (2011 or newer, I believe), play the movie in iTunes, and send the content to the ATV.  This is not ideal to me, as you have to use the Mac (iTunes) to control the ATV.\nHome Sharing is the way to go with ATV.\nThere are lots of other options like Plex if you want to use Roku or Chromecast, which should work without an internet connection.\n", "Q: Apple keeps asking me to accept the new iCloud terms and conditions A pop-up will appear on my phone asking me to accept the new terms and conditions.

This would take a couple of hours to accomplish so I suggest you accept the  T&C and than log out from icloud via 'settings > icloud' like @Buscar said.\n\nA: Since you had the iCloud turned on initially, you will have to accept the T&C anyway. \nYou have a iCloud account!\nTurning it off now is to late since you used the product already.\n\nA: None of the existing answers solved my problem on iOS 9. I have multiple iCloud accounts configured on my phone, which was the root of the problem. I followed the instructions posted here and my problems were solved. For posterity's sake, here is an excerpt from that link:\n\nThere’s not a lot of chatter about this, primarily because it only\n  affects a few few iPhone/iPad users who happen to have and use more\n  than one Apple ID on their device. This is you, so here’s how to fix\n  this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Tap Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then tap on the first iCloud account. You should see a Terms and Conditions link near the\n  top in blue.\n  \n*Tap the link, scroll to the bottom and tap the Accept link.\n  \n*Repeat steps 1 & 2 for any other iCloud accounts you have showing in the list of accounts.\n  \n\n", "Q: How to get client Mac to use caching facility from Mac OS X Server on Yosemite I have installed Mac OSX server onto one machine. Caching is enabled.\nHow do I now configure a client Mac on the same network to start using this cache for both web browsing and software updates?\nI have tried System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> Proxies and enabled \"Web Proxy (HTTP)\" and entered the local IP of the machine running Mac OSX Server (192.168.1.24) and the port number 49524 but this doesn't work. I just see a blank white screen when I try and view any web page in Chrome.\nDoes anybody know the correct set up instructions for the clients? There appears to be very little to help me out on Google.\n\nA: The Caching service is no web-proxy. It just provides software updates, purchased apps from the Mac App Store, iBooks and iTunes U content.\nWhen you first enable the caching server, it registers its public IP and private IP with Apple.  If a client tries to download a software update or an app from the same public IP as the server, Apple “introduces” the client to the server automatically. Therefore client configuration is not required.\nIf you want a proxy server install Squid/Squidman\n\nA: It is to a point transparent.  Here is a good quote from the Apple article about caching server \n\"and by default is configured to support clients that share the same public IP address behind a NAT.\"\nAs long as you have your clients set up behind the same NAT it will download from Apple for the first download and every client after that will then download form the Caching server.  Take a look at the picture below from Apple's documentation.  So in the end their is no client side setup needed if your network is setup correctly.\nApple Link\n\n", "Q: I transfer a picture folder from desktop to an imovie project in 10.0.3 How do I transfer a folder from desktop to an imovie 10.0.5 project?\n\nA: In iMovie you can import files.

I had this working fine in Tiger thru Mavericks, but it broke in Yosemite. Pressing F4 now launches Launchpad, and only fnF4 triggers Dashboard. \nLaunchpad is useless compared to Spotlight or even the Dock. I'd much rather have the F4 key triggering Dashboard again, or even Notifications (which is really starting to come along). \nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Prefs / Mission Control / Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts / Show Dashboard set to F4.\n\n*Syst Prefs / Keyboard / Keyboard / Use all F-keys as standard function keys unticked.\n\n*Syst Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Launchpad & Dock / Show Launchpad unticked. \n\n*Syst Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Mission Control / Show Dashboard set to F4. \n\n\nIdeas?

From what you’ve described as your settings, it should be working…\n\nA: I have the same settings described in the message above and I don't get the Dashboard either. I have ended up assigning the top-right corner as a \"hot corner\" that shows the Dashboard.\nSystem Preferences > Mission control > Hot corners (left-bottom corner of the window).\n\nA: System Preferences > Mission Control > Dashboard (drop-down)\nChange dashboard drop down box from \"off\" to either \"As overlay\" or \"As space\"\nSide note: I do have Show Dashboard set as F4 as seen below in this same Mission Ctrl window. Also, I have the same settings as was mentioned in the original posted question.\n\nA: I mapped dashboard to F6 on my Mac Pro with a desktop keyboard. It doesn't require pressing the fn button since this key does not have a special use. But I think on Macbooks the F5 and F6 keys do keyboard illumination so that might not work on a laptop.\n", "Q: Finding CodeBlocks that works or fixing bugs? I am using Codeblocks to develop C++ code on OSX Mavericks. I am currently running into the problem where the software occasionally will crash and than continue to crash every time the software is started again. I know for this software package there is a bunch of different sources: code blocks pre built apt, mac port version, and I believe even a version you can download through svn or git hub which is the nightly build. \nAdditionally, I also have problems with the auto complete sometimes not working.\nCan someone recommend a version that worked for them with a reasonable explanation on how to install it? Or, if you had similar issues with code blocks, how you went about fixing the bugs?\nBy the way I am using the pre built 32 bit apt from code blocks website. \n\nA: I was having the same issue. \nA workaround / fix is to  disable the autocomplete plugin if you consider \"works\" without autocomplete.\n", "Q: On iOS, do \"Automatic Downloads\" (incl. Music, Apps, Books, Updates) download on public or slow WiFi networks? If I have \"Automatic Downloads\" enabled for some or all of the categories (Music, Apps, Books, Updates), then these items will download when available, while I'm connected to my home's WiFi network. \nI enabled these settings recently, so I'm not quite sure on this yet, but if I'm connected to a public network, then will they still download? Because public WiFi networks are often quite slow, so I think the downloads might stall. Is it possible to instead keep these options enabled, but prevent downloads from taking place on WiFi networks that are not my home network?\nOr at worst, if a download stalls and I can no longer connect to WiFi again, then is there a way to revert an update that only downloaded halfway? Would restarting my device do the trick?\n\nA: Yes, they will download even in slow Wi-Fi connections. There is no option to choose an Wi-Fi connection to do the automatic downloads. You can only disable the downloads on Cellular Data on Settings / iTunes & App Store / Use Cellular Data.\n\nA: When you enable automatic downloads, your iPhone will download new content over every WiFi network.\nI believe that it will also download over your data connection when not connected to wifi. But only when the files the iPhone tries to download are below 10 MB.\n", "Q: Why is my startup disk so full? I've been getting messages recently that \"My startup disk is almost full,\" and I'm quite sure I haven't used the full 250GB of my Macbook's hard drive. Using \"Get Info\" on Macintosh HD says that I'm using around 245GB (aka 5GB from being full), but I have no idea what could be using that much space. My home directory (with Photos, Movies, Downloads, etc.) is only around 34GB. Applications? only 11.\nIn fact, I looked into it using a disk sweeping application, and it profiled my hard drive as only having 65.1GB in total! Where are the other ~200GB? What's filling them?\n(I did search using Finder for files over 1GB, and there were only a few, so I don't think the problem is one massive file).\nResult of ImageDiskSweeper:\n\n\nA: It turns out that another user account (not the one I was logged into) had many gigabytes of photos stored on the hard drive. DiskImageSweeper, along with any other tools (spotlight search, etc.) could not search through the other user's files, so they were virtually undetectable.\nI solved the problem by logging into the other user account and clearing up space. I imagine that you could also just delete the user's account and have the same effect.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with a customer's MacBook Pro about a year ago. The disk was saying it was practically full, yet there was hardly anything on it. A few steps to take you through here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple () Menu on your Menu Bar\n\n*Click \"About This Mac\"\n\n*Click the \"Storage\" tab \n\n*You should see a breakdown of your hard drive as in the screenshot below\n\n\n\nThe case I saw last year had an enormous amount of data reflecting under \"Backups\", but none of that information could be found anywhere, and disk scanners couldn't find it. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE && killall Finder\n\n*Open Finder and navigate to the root of your drive (\"/\")\n\n*Press Cmd+alt+i to bring up the Inspector (I prefer this over Cmd+i for this step as it allows you to change the contents of the Inspector window depending on what you have selected)\n\n*With nothing selected, Inspector should show you that you have 245GB used.\n\n\nNow comes the tedious part.\nSince you say you've already checked your User folder and Applications, don't worry about them, but otherwise check each of the hidden folders to verify their file size. In the case I had, \".Trashes\" was actually the culprit. There were two \".Trashes\" folders and one was heavily bloated. Check to see if you have multiple ones. If you do, check their sizes, one of them is most likely the culprit. The other folder to check would be \"/var\" as this is where caches are stored from Mavericks onwards.\nKeep checking through folders until you find the largest one, then drill down from there and trash it (so long as you know it is actually a safe folder to trash!).\nIn the event that you don't have permission to trash the folder, switch back to Terminal and run:\nsudo rm -rf /path/to/folder\nreplacing \"/path/to/folder\" with the actual folder path.\nTo re-hide hidden files once you're done, simply run\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE\nin Terminal.\nHope all that helps. :)\n\nA: I had a similar issue with a client's laptop trying to install NI Kontakt Ultimate 10 (~ 330 GB) on a SSD with 400 GB \"free\" space.\nProbably TimeMachine local snapshots is enabled on your Mac. Local snapshots are basically backup files stored on your local hard-disk (as opposed to regular ones stored on the external TimeMachine volume). This is a useful feature for people who travel a lot, so they can revert files to recent versions even when they are not connected to their home TimeMachine.\nTo disable \"local snapshots\" open Terminal and enter sudo tmutil disablelocal and hit ↵.\nEnter your admin password at the prompt (the password  will not be visible) and hit ↵ again.\nEnter exit, hit ↵ and quit Terminal.\nIt may take a while to free up the space.\nNow check in Finder and Disk Utility if you regained valuable disk space.\nTo reenable local snapshots just enter sudo tmutil enablelocal.\n\nA: You could make a backup using time machine to an external harddrive.\nWhen that is completed shut down your mac and reboot it with the alt-key pressed.\nYou will get in a menu where you can choose which drive you want to startup from. When you have os x 10.10 installed you will see the drives \"Macintosh HD\" amd os x 10.10 recovery.\nStart you mac from the recovery drive and go to disk utility.\nYou can erase you disk (Macintosh HD). keep in mind that OS X needs to be installed again than. You can reinstall OS X from the menu where you can choose disk utility. To reinstall os x, an internet connection is required.\nWhen you did this, you can start up your mac like you normally do and go to time machine. Do not restore the whole backup! Select some files to restore and check if your problem with the disk space still occures. Repeat this step until all document are restored on you disk.\nSometimes a bug in the software can create this, or orther, problems and is most of the times solved by a clean install.\n\nA: I found that the problem was Microsoft Office (big surprise). It had library files that were almost 87 GB, and for what? \nI had to uninstall the programs, go into the Library files and delete them. The way to completely uninstall MS Office for Mac is here: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3\nAlso try to clear out the .trashes folder: \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/728709/how-to-delete-trashes-on-ntfs-drive-on-mac\n\nA: I had the same problem. I think, disk sweeping application is best. I cleared my space manually by looking into disk sweeping data and freed 60 GB of space. Mac saves everything on hard drive even your emails. Dropbox, Camera Roll and emails files are also synced with hard drive. Even if you are using XCode or Android, there are GB's of backup and useless data stored on hard drive. Just go through \"Users\" and \"Library\" folder manually and check what you need and what you do not need. Unsync Google and Dropbox from external hard drive. Check these blogs for help.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://blog.neverthesamecolor.net/how-to-recover-disk-space-from-xcode/\n\n*https://www.dropbox.com/guide/business/manage-files/save-your-hard-drive-space\nHope, it will help you.\n\nA: My startup disc was full with over 90G of the dreaded \"other\"!I read some of the answers and thought I'd give you a more current answer to how to free up space. From the Apple App Store, I downloaded an free, Apple-approved app called \"Disc Expert\". (I haven't checked but they may have one for Windows, too.) \nDarn it! I thought it would show my screen shot! But if you copy & paste the address in your search bar, you'll see what I wanted to show you here.\n\n\nIt will show the top 25 largest files, (and in my case, also hundreds of other files that I didn't know existed!)  Anyway, you can right-click on any file--it gives you an option to open it in Finder so you can see what it is. Then you can drag and drop any unwanted files into the trash! (I used an external hard drive to save important things.) I also dragged a lot of files into my iCloud account (which you can see on your Finder window on the left-hand side. External Hard drives are MUCH more reasonable, cost-wise, than they used to be. I just bought a Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB for $59.00 on Amazon, but check different electronic stores to compare prices. It also comes with 200GB of free OneDrive cloud storage for 2 years is included when you register a new Backup Plus drive online! \nAfter registering your drive on Seagate.com, a link will be provided to add 200GB to any new or existing OneDrive account.\nSorry so long! I'm not an expert--but I am a fast learner and researcher, so I tried to write this in layman's terms. I hope it helps! Good Luck!:-)\n", "Q: iPhone - How to set up not requiring passcode if recently closed I have an iPhone with iOS 8. Is there a way to setup my phone where it doesn't require a passcode to unlock if it has been closed in the last 5 (or some amount) minutes?\nI know that my computer has a 15min feature.\nThanks\n\nA: You have to disable Touch ID for \"iPhone Unlock\" on newer iOS devices in order to set a time to lock your phone.  In Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, disable (toggle off) Touch ID for iPhone Unlock.  Once toggled off, you can then change the time to require passcode by accessing the \"Require Passcode\" option.\nBasically it sets to \"immediately\" only with Touch ID enabled for unlocking your phone.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Settings App and navigate to General –> Passcode Lock.\n\n*To set the passcode lock delay, locate the button where you see Require Passcode. By default you will see “Immediately” next to Require Passcode. This means that as soon as your device locks, your passcode will be enabled. If you want to delay this, tap on the button and select After 1 minute, After 5 minutes, or After 15 minutes. When you select any of these three time intervals, your device will not require you to re-enter your passcode for the relative time you selected.\n\nA: I believe the setting you are looking for is Settings > Touch ID and Passcode > Require Passcode.\nIt should be noted that using a Microsoft Exchange account in email can effect the options available here.  For example the only option on my phone is \"immediately\".  this thread is how i finally learned why I only have the option \"immediately\".\n\nA: I think what you mean can be found under settings> general. There's a function called, I think, Automatic Lock.\nYou can automatically lock your iphone after:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 minute\n\n*2 minutes\n\n*3 minutes\n\n*4 minutes\n\n*5 minutes\n\n*Never\n\n\nA: If you want to override the requirement to use a passcode - say if Microsoft exchange is installed and the requirement for a passcode is set server-side; and if your phone is JB'd then you can install cydia then activator then an app called bypass which will run within activator.  both activator and bypass are located on the bigboss repo that comes preinstalled in cydia.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but I've found with my 6s, running iOS 9.3.2, if you have the option \"Use Touch ID for:\" and you have \"iPhone Unlock\" turned on then the option \"Require Passcide\" will be automatically limited to \"immediately\" as well as selected & unchangeable. \n\nA: 6s \n10.1.1\nturned off Touch ID \nAllowed delayed lock options \n", "Q: Thunderbolt to HDMI (Not DisplayPort to HDMI) My first question is do Thunderbolt to HDMI adapters exist? The reason I'm specifying Thunderbolt and not DisplayPort is because I have a Belkin Thunderbolt2 Dock. If I use a MDP>HDMI adapter and the HDMI port on the unit, only one display works. However, after borrowing my friend's Elgato Thunderbolt dock and connecting it to the TB port on the Belkin dock, I could use the HDMI port on each dock on both monitors, no issue. \nI would hate to have to buy two docks to set up my docked setup, but I could if I absolutely have to. The reason I want this to work is because I have a HengeDock for my laptop, and the HDMI port is inaccessible from the dock since it points upright. \nWorst case, I guess I could get another DP to HDMI adapter, but that would occupy my other thunderbolt port, and my TB external does not have a daisy chain connector.\n\nA: Mini DisplayPort and Thunderbolt are essentially the same connection, just with different hardware controlling them. Thunderbolt is essentially a combination of Mini DisplayPort and PCIe. I assume this was done for backwards compatibility with older hardware that was Mini DP (so you could use an Apple Cinema Display on a newer model MacBook Pro, for example). Of course, Mini DP doesn't have the same power behind it (in that it doesn't combine with PCIe) as Thunderbolt so you can't daisy chain them.\nUnfortunately, from what I have been able to see, and from my product knowledge working at an iStore, there is no Thunderbolt to HDMI, only Mini DP. The actual daisy chaining that goes on inside Thunderbolt devices is done within the device itself and would require a power source to power it. Since there is no power source to an adaptor, there is no point making a Thunderbolt to HDMI connector when Mini DP is (for all intents and purposes) the same thing. Apple also says here that if you have a Thunderbolt chain, the Mini DP connection should come last. This could be the reason for only one of your HDMI ports working as the built in one would most likely be positioned after the Mini DP connection.\nOf course, that isn't to say there is no multi-output HDMI Thunderbolt peripheral (a single Thunderbolt cable to a device with multiple HDMI ports), it may exist as it is possible, I just haven't seen one. The closest I could find for you were these two devices, Mini DisplayPort to HDMI® (2x HDMI® Output) Converter w/ Audio and Zotac ZT-MDP2HD Mini DP to Dual HDMI Cable.\n", "Q: Navigate Finder Sidebar using arrow keys Yosemite Is there a way I can navigate the sidebar items using arrow keys? I am using Yosemite.\n\nA: There is no way of navigate that way. You can only use the following shortcuts to navigate through finder:\n\n\nA: Jherran's answer is good for the Finder sidebar’s standard locations, but if you want to navigate to any of your own folders that you have added to the sidebar and you don't want to rely on third-party software, another option is Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator and create a new 'Service’.\n\n*Set 'Service receives' to 'no input', and 'in' to\n'Finder.app'.\n\n*In the sidebar, under ‘Library > Files & Folders’, locate ‘Get\nSpecified Finder Items’ and drag it into the workflow area.\n\n*Click ‘Add’ to choose the folder you want a shortcut for.\n\n*In the sidebar locate ‘Open Finder Items’ and drag it into the\nworkflow area.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Save your workflow and give it a logical name like ‘Go to\nMyFolderName folder’.\n\n*Go to ‘System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts’, and click on\n‘Services’ in the sidebar.\n\n*Locate your workflow within ‘General’ and click on it. (If your\nworkflow isn’t there, you may need to restart or log out and back\nin.)\n\n*Click the ‘Add Shortcut’ button and give it a keyboard shortcut that\ndoesn’t conflict with one of Apple's default Finder shortcuts. (If\nyou do have a conflict, you can always redefine the default Finder\nshortcut. For example, for a folder called ‘Projects’, I wanted to\nuse Command-Shift-P, but this conflicts with ‘Show Preview’ (which I\nhardly ever use). So I redefined the ‘Show Preview’ and ‘Hide\nPreview’ shortcuts to Command-Shift-Option-P.)\n\n*Enjoy your new Finder shortcut!\n\n\nLet’s hope Apple doesn’t remove wonderful automation features like this in a future release of macOS as some are speculating. That would be a very sad day indeed.\n", "Q: Myriad of (relatively minor) issues on my rMBP in the last few days Not sure how to generalize this, but my rMBP 15\" 2014 has started having several weird issues in the past few days:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing freezes (briefly) in Notes\n\n*Searching “Keychain” from spotlight returns some results but NOT “Keychain Access”\n\n*Xcode stops building files because “too many open files on system”, fixed by restart\n\n*Mail autocomplete doesn’t work -> Restart Mail, freezes on open -> Restart again, same -> Open Internet Accounts in System Prefs, freezes -> Restart computer, works\n\n*Beachball opening folder from Dock -> Downloads (about 10 seconds)\n\n\nNone of these issues seems to stay for long.

I clean installed Yosemite about 6 months ago too.\nDoes anyone know this might be? Hardware issue, like failing motherboard or something? Or (hopefully) some kind of software bug?\n\nA: We've had a couple of machines at work in a similar state, they were brought back to normal operation by starting in safe boot then moving the Containers folder from the user's Library folder to the desktop. This has the effect of clearing the startup caches, performing a disk check and resetting sandboxed applications back their default settings.\nA new Containers folder will be automatically created. Any applications that have lost important data after moving the Containers folder can be restored by copying the relevant folder from the old Containers folder to the new one - I always make a copy of the ARD folder as any custom UNIX commands will be lost otherwise.\nAs a matter of course I would also want to run a disk permissions check and give the drive structure a check with DiskWarrior.\n", "Q: iTerm2: How to change the color used to highlight search results? It seems that iTerm2 is hardcoded to highlight search results using a yellow background color. I tried both the latest release and the nightlies but could not find a way to change that color.\nDid I miss something? It seems implausible to me, that a terminal emulator with such a degree of customizability would really hardcode a single color while at the same time making virtually everything else user-configurable.\nFor clarification, here's a screenshot:\n\nAs you can see, I searched the screen contents for the word \"stack\" and all its occurrences are highlighted in yellow (except for the selected one).\n\nA: For iTerm2 Text color changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the menus choose Profiles → Open Profiles.\n\n*Click the Edit Profiles button, then the Colors tabs.\n\n\n*You can change the colors by clicking on the color wells.\n\nYou can find iTerm color schemes at iterm2colorschemes.com.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the yellow color is actually hardcoded in the source code and cannot be configured in the preferences.\nHere is the corresponding code snippet where the color is applied:\n if (isMatch && !bgselected) {\n     aColor = [NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed:1 green:1 blue:0 alpha:1];\n } else ...\n\nSource: https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/blob/3a99bb0a0e5924e2d515ec9638a4ffa6731a5682/sources/PTYTextView.m#L6274\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 time-lapse maximum length? I'd like to record a two-day long time-lapse video with iPad Air 2.\nHow long can iPad Air 2 record (charging while recording) time-lapse video in iOS 8.1.2?\n\nA: I would say until it uses up all its storage. How long it takes to do that would depend on the scene being shot and how long the intervals between taking photos are. \n\nA: It can take a time lapse as long as it has battery. If you plug it in it will go until something stops working or you end it. Storage space is not a problem because it discards half the frames after a certain period of time and doesn't take up any more storage on a seven day time lapse Than it does on a one hour one. Seven days is the longest I've gone and it was with an old iPhone 4s.

It also is an issue when doing clean installs.\nThe card I have does not have an FCC ID or brand label on it and is simply labeled as \"USB 3.0\" with 2 USB 3.0 ports. The single chip on it says:\n\nD720200AF1 112EV073G CHINA\n\nThose that I have looked at already:\n\n\n*\n\n*The LaCie USB 3.0 LaCie ExpressCard for Mac has not had a driver update in 2+ years. \n\n*The Sonnet Allegro USB 3.0 on Amazon card looks physically the same as the unmarked board I have but with additional printing. \n\n*There are some cards on eBay that claim to use the NEC/RENESAS chip or same specifications but it looks the same as the card I have and as the Sonnet card and sound like they require a Kext. Note I got my card from eBay years ago as well\nI am looking for a specific card by an established vendor for the 2008 Mac Pro to get USB 3.0 speeds (not just a 2.0 with some boost, but true USB 3.0) that doesn't require the use of Kext Wizards and as much chasing of emulation drivers used in Hackintoshes and has been confirmed to work with Yosemite.\nHas anyone found that that exists?\nNote: It is my assumption/opinion 10.10 Yosemite will likely (based on its age and is already oldest version supported and the hardware unique to the 2008 and not as upgradable as the 2009+ doesn't support many of features of Yosemite {airdrop, handoff, support for current version of Bluetooth, USB, CUDA, etc...) be the last to support the 2008 Mac Pro but the system still is going strong and close comparable benchmarks to my 2012 & 2013 ones so I would like to continue to use it as long as possible. I am only noting this to try to mitigate some of the editorial comments and keep the discussion 'on topic'.\n\nA: (Just wanting to close the loop on this topic since it's an old question without a definitive answer)\nThe chip for the device referenced by the OP - D720200AF1 - has long since been EOL'd by the manufacturer.  There have been some references to \"hacks\" to get this to work, but ultimately, they are unreliable because a device driver is more than just support for a particular chipset.  Ultimately, no native driver exists for card in question.\nThat said, to get USB 3.0 on a Mac Pro (2008 through 2012 models), Inatek makes a very good 4 port USB 3.0 PCIe adapter card.  Their specifications state that it works with Yosemite and above and I can confirm that it works with El Capitan (it also works with Windows XP through 10).\n\nA: My understanding is that recent OS X versions have a built-in driver for the \"Fresco Logic\" FL1100 USB 3 chipset, which is used in the new Mac Pros.

That should take you to the startup selection screen. Hopefully it'll show you an icon for Windows and another icon for OSX. \nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1310\nIf it doesn't then you might need to install OSX from scratch. If your Mac is fairly recent you can do this from the Internet directly. Otherwise you'll need to source install media.\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT4718\n\nA: OP says that a \"virtual machine\" starts. One wonders if it is a startup item and that just loads immediately on startup. If so holding the SHIFT key at startup should disable any startup items.\nFailing that the OPTION key at startup that Alistair mentioned will allow you to choose a boot partition and boot into Mac O/S if it is installed. Note that it is possible to not install Mac O/S on a Mac and just boot into Windows by default.\n", "Q: 2006 MacPro - Worth upgrading for use as a VM host? I have a MacPro 1,1 bought in early 2007. Earlier this year I was about to recycle it but tried installing an SSD as a boot/apps drive. It has been a great success, it now feels like a new machine and I'm contemplating souping it up to  16GB of RAM and using it to run Windows VMs (I'm a .Net developer) in Parallels Desktop or VMWare or similar.\nThe RAM is going to cost < $50. I was wondering if this is a good idea in 2014 or if I'm going to hit a load of constraints imposed by the age of the hardware. Any comments or observations very gratefully received. I cannot and will not pay thousands for a new MacPro.\n\nA: Short answer, yes.\nThe MacPro 1,1 can run 10.7.5 as it's latest OS.  I have a 2008 Black MacBook which runs the same.  Despite being on an OS from 2011, you can still run the latest version (v7.1.0) of VMWare Fusion.  You can also jam 32 GB of RAM in there.  Plus, the Xeon from 2006 will almost be comparable to a Core i5 from a couple of years ago.\nLike you, I also updated to an SSD.  Even though the RAM in my MacBook is only 2 GB, it is an amazingly fast machine considering it's specs.  SSDs are simply amazing, they are the best upgrades you can make.\nI also have a 2012 Mac Mini.  I installed the maximum 16GB of RAM and a 240 GB SSD.  I am able to run OS X as well as a Windows VM and 2 Linux VMs with almost no degrdation in performance.\nIt's worth noting 10.7.5 might soon be cut off from receiving security updates, however I imagine you can configure some networking where the VMs have internet access yet the host machine only has access to the local LAN.\nI'd say go for it.  That machine is far from dead, there are still some amazing things you can do with it.\n\nA: The main limitation is that it won't run a more recent OS X version than 10.7 (Lion), which probably won't be supported with security updates for much longer. I wouldn't put it on the Internet, but it should be fine as a VM host on your LAN.\n\nA: Definitely Yes\nMy 08 is still well worth keeping going - it's still my main machine, with up-rated GPU, SSD, & RAM.\nI see no reason why it shouldn't be worth keeping an 06 going for a while longer. Maybe Bootcamp rather than VM, if you need what speed remains in the machine. As you have plenty of drive bays, I'd Bootcamp to a different physical drive, seems to save issues in the long run. \nYou can hammer Mavericks onto it too, if needs be - see Modernizing the 2006 and 2007 Mac Pro to Go Beyond OS X Lion [far too much to précis here, but it doesn't look very difficult, just fiddly]\n\nA: I have a MP1,1 that served me faithfully from October 2006 to around July of this year. Like you, I put a SSD in it and ended up with what is largely a new machine. Over those 7+ years I upgraded HD's, video cards, added some RAM and that's about it.\nUnfortunately the upgrade cycle ran out of steam this year. App Store submissions require Xcode 6 now, and that requires 10.10 now, and that doesn't easily run on the 1,1. Yes, it can be run, but reading over the threads it is highly unstable configuration-wise and will break with every update I'm forced to install as part of Xcode upgrades. At some point it's sanity over money.\nIf you don't game, then just buy the Mac Mini. It has much more horsepower than the MP1,1 (I tested it) and is basically a small MP for all intents. But if you do game, it's basically useless. No, not basically, completely useless. If they make a MP6,1 with a single GPU that would be the machine for me, but they don't.\n\nA: Now in 2021, I'd offer this thought: the power consumption of those Mac Pros is very high; and the distance between the OS they can run and present-day technologies is much larger.\nYou may be able to get similar performance or better (for some tasks) for a much lower power usage with a secondhand Mini (e.g. 2012 4-core i7), that has a bigger 'compatibility overlap' with the here and now.\n\nA: I have a 2006 Mac Pro 16 gig of ram 2 5355 quad core Intel processors 10.5 terabytes of storage and running yosamite using refit running Snow Leopard,lion,Mavericks,Windows XP, windows 7 ,Windows Vista ,and windows xp media media machine runs like new without SSD all these upgrades for very cheap and well worth it i use this machine to run Pro Tools 11 it  performs magnificently.

Where is this coming from?\n\nA: Mac OS is runnning Time Machine backups for you, even if your Time Machine disk is not connected. The backup directory is automatically created and mounted as a network share via NFS at the /Volumes/Mobilebackups directory. \nThis is not a backup in the disaster recovery sense, but it will allow you to restore older versions of your files, if you by accident delete a file or regret an edit you did.\nSupposedly it will consume a lot of disk space, but only as long as there's at least 20 % free space.\nDisable the service with this terminal command if you dont like it:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nTo see the NFS path, run the mount command.

My questions are, (1) What is the $PATH and (2) how do I configure it to include LaTeX? \nThanks!\nBest,\nLJR\nPS: I am using TeXShop. \nPPS: I am new to coding and LaTeX. \n\nA: The $PATH provides the shell (command line) a list of directories to look at for executables. So, when you type a command in the command line, the shell (the program running in the terminal) will look in the locations listed in your $ PATH for an executable matching the command. The first one it finds, it runs.\nTo see the information type echo $PATH on the command line. This should return something along the lines of:\n\n/Users/name/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nTo add a new location to your path (i.e. /opt/local/bin )you issue a command such as\n\nPATH=/opt/local/bin:\"${PATH}\"\n\nThis adds /opt/local/bin to your $PATH \n*Specifically it adds it first, so this will be the first place the shell will look for a command! This is important because if you have multiple copies of an executable you'll want to know which one is being executed.\nBTW, Generally you will add your path command to your .bash_profile file (~/.bash_profile) that way it will set your $PATH as you desire overtime you laugh the  BASH shell (the default on OS X).\n", "Q: Help with a simple email script for OSX I would be so happy if someone could assist me in creating an Applescript to send some emails.

When the RAID array is later automagically mounted, it's default mountpoint already exists, so it is instead mounted at /Volumes/RAID6-11TV 1, which causes no good at all.\nIs there a way to fix rebooting so that either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server.app won't launch until the RAID disk is ready, or\n\n*Delay OS boot so that it won't finish launching until the RAID disk is ready?\n\n\nRegarding (1), I've edited /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.serverd.plist to add a QueueDirectories key, but that doesn't seem to have any effect, and WatchPaths sounds like it has the wrong semantics, so I'm leery to even try that.\nRegarding (2), if I boot into Single User mode (holding down Command+S during boot), then wait until all messages have completed, then hit Ctrl+D to continue the boot, /Volumes/RAID6-11TB is properly mounted as intended.\nHowever, this doesn't help for automated reboots when I'm away (e.g. after power failures).

The second and third monitors have good quality display, although their display rate is too slow to stream movies on (they are fine for reading email, browsing the web, etc.).  This was the best solution I have found so far without purchasing additional thunderbolt monitors.\nVery annoyed with Apple on this one, but it does work.  However, I do need to often set my monitors to not be mirrored, and their order after rebooting.  Not too difficult, but its the best solution I've seen.\nMind you, my windows PC works perfectly with multiple monitors.  Windows did better than mac on this one...\n\nA: You can only connect two or more displays to your mac when it is a thunderbolt display. \nWhen you have an thunderbolt display and a non-thunderbolt display, your mac will automatically start working with the thunderbolt display until you unplug it.\n\nA: So the final answer on this, supported by links in comments and answers above is that the documentation says clearly there are only two possible ways to achieve what you are looking for. Either you daisy chain thunderbolt displays (obviously doesn't work for you). Or an hdmi and a true Thunderbolt Display.  The first of those two possibilities is spelled out. The second of them is inferred by a lack of anything explicitly saying that option isn't possible. That being said if you're plugging in hdmi and a true Thunderbolt Display and it isn't working then it would stand to reason there was a tiny oversight in the documentation and that also isn't a possibility. \n\nA: Please believe me when I say that the Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Dock will not support two monitors if you have an older MacBook Pro.  I have a 2011.  One Thunderbolt port.  It just does not have the capacity to drive two monitors.  I have exhausted all options with it.  Only one external monitor will work.\nI did however connect two monitors using the Dell D3100 USB Docking Station. \nI purchased this on-line directly from Dell. Arrived quickly. Simple setup.  Works great with my MacBook! Actually allows for three monitors if required.  My MacBook as one, plus two additional displays. Just had to download the correct video drivers from Displaylink.

I have a Macbook that the OS has crashed (I am not 100% sure if the Hard Drive is dead, but I would like to save the files before anything else). \nWhen I boot up, the screen just remains grey and there is a spinner that stays on forever.\nI thought that if I got a thunderbolt cable and connected that Macbook to my other Macbook Pro, I could boot the crashed drive Macbook into Target mode and then get access to the files.\nThat doesn't seem to be working and now I am re-reading the instructions it seems that the target computer needs to be bootable (i.e. into OS X, which mine is not). I'm not familiar with how to take this unibody MacBook Pro apart.\nSo how do I get access to those files, before I reinstall the OS?\n\nA: One option would be to used your other Macbook Pro to create a Linux boot CD or USB drive, then boot your Macbook from that.

I have 8 GB of ram and I have only 1.25GB free memory left, not enough to run 2 tabs of gmail. for chrome keep asking me to kill the process of my Gmail which 2-3 days ago I'm always have like 2-3GB free memory after opening 2 gmail accounts and some others websites.\nI also installed auto memory clean to help me get more memory back but recently when my mac start, a few minutes later memory almost dropped to 0GB so my memory cleaner app keep to clean memory after that memory consuming so fast and repeat above process again. Memory clean doesn't solve my problem in a long term.\nI have closed all the apps to free memory and I see that when idle I should have more memory back but it's not.\nSo I looked into Activity Monitor and Memory clean app, I saw 2 things that consuming lots of memory which I don't think it's true.\nI'm trying to use cleanmymac 2 to help me solve the issue specially to kick away some file cache problem, but I don't see any difference.\n\nA: First of all it's probably a good idea to stop using that memory cleaner app. They aren't necessary these days; if they ever were. The memory systems on modern operating systems are perfectly capable of maintaining themselves. The way these memory cleaner application work is by claiming a huge chunk of RAM, thereby forcing everything not critical out of RAM, and then releasing the RAM they've requested. Your swapping something that has been fine tuned over years by a lot of very smart people, with some guy wielding a mallet.\nThis could actually be the reason you are seeing your free RAM drop to zero. It could be the memory cleaner app itself.\nThe idea that you need to have a large amount of RAM sitting \"free\" is just wrong. When you close applications the RAM isn't necessarily immediately freed. All modern operating systems keep recently used files cached in RAM so that if you (or the system) decide to reopen something recently closed the files open quicker.\nIf you do have a performance problem with Gmail in Chrome the problem is likely elsewhere. I highly doubt it has anything to do with the amount of free RAM on your Mac.\n\nA: First, Chrome uses a lot of memory, especially if you have had it open several days.\nUsually closing apps helps recover and frees portions of memory, but still keeps some for the very same reason RAM is used.\nAfter closing you're apps, you can purge command in your terminal to force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied).\nsudo purge\n\nEnter your administrative password, wait a few seconds. Your Mac should be close to initial boot conditions.\nman purge for more information:\n\npurge -- force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied)\nPurge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions with a cold disk buffer cache for performance analysis.

Is there a way to do that from Snow Leopard?\n\nA: This should do the trick:\nIn Terminal:\ndiskutil eraseDisk MS-DOS <newname> <diskID>\n\nwhere  is the new name for the disk and  is the disk identifier (you can find this by getting the disk info from Finder or Disk Utility, or by typing \"diskutil list\" into Terminal).\n\nA: If you tell OS X to format a disk or volume in \"MS-DOS\" format, it'll try to choose the \"best\" option from FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32, based on the volume's size. If you need to override its choice, you have to use the command-line diskutil command with a more explicit volume format like \"MS-DOS FAT16\". Here's an example:\n$ diskutil info /Volumes/UNTITLED/\n   Device Identifier:        disk2s1\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk2s1\n   Part of Whole:            disk2\n   [...]\n\n   File System Personality:  MS-DOS FAT32\n   Type (Bundle):            msdos\n   Name (User Visible):      MS-DOS (FAT32)\n\n   Partition Type:           DOS_FAT_32\n\n...note that at this point, I could either erase & reformat just the volume (disk2s1) or the entire disk (disk2).

I've already tried the \"Open this file on...\" function on Dropbox, but it doesn't show me Safari as an app that accepts that kind of file. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you try to accessing the files using the regular sharing feature the HTML file will fail to find it's linked CSS, JavaScript, etc files because of the way that Dropbox generates these sharing links.\nHowever you should have a \"Public\" folder in your Dropbox. If you drop your files in there and select one you should see a \"Copy public link...\" option above the file list. If you use that, instead of the \"Share\" button then your HTML file should find it's linked files.\n\n\nA: Try copying the share link of HTML file, paste it into safari, and then change the \"www\" to \"dl\".

I would like to start a process and monitor its LOG_DEBUG syslog messages.\nI know that I can change the filter of an already running process with syslog -c process (and then monitor its messages with syslog -w -k Sender process), but that requires the process already to be running and furthermore fills up logfiles with messages that I only need temporarily.\nIs my only option to change the running configuration with syslog -config, then later restore the configuration once I have read the messages I want?  Surely there is a \"better\" way.\n\nA: Using the tail command in Terminal.app will follow a log file and print out in real time whats being written to just that log file.\ntail -f /path/to/your/log/file.log\n\nIf your process has a common name that shows in every log file, like com.my.process you can tail the file and grep out for that keyword/process.\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | grep \"com.my.process\"\n\ntail command\n", "Q: iPhone 4 signing in issues So I just got my iPhone and I made a new Apple iTunes account and I verified my account through email then I tried to download a game and it says please sign in so I tried signing it and it said I need to complete my registration and to put in bank details , which I already did signing up... so I put them in again and this time it came back with \" card declined, payment method didn't work\" blah blah blah..\nI cannot download games and I cannot access my emails or apples iTunes I cannot sign in it wot let me can someone help?\n\nA: The best way to solve this is to call Apple Care (http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201232).

Which is plenty for my use, at least it has been. I usually have no more than 3 apps running as notes, reminders and safari. I also use statsbar to watch the performance and the usual is 1/3gb of ram free. The problem I started noticing is in the past week the machine has started overheating as I can feel it by touching the laptop and hearing the fan, which only used to happen when I tried to turn on all I could to see if the machine would handle it.\nI supposed some would say that it also may depend on the amount of stuff I have open in safari as neither notes nor reminders use up the cpu that makes it overheat. I usually have up to 5 tabs open: youtube, couple of news websites and a couple of wiki tabs. Which the machine used to handle with no problems at all. \nSo my main question is how come the machine is going crazy and what can I do to prevent it?\n\nA: Try uninstalling Adobe Flash. Flash doesn't work well on Macs. Flash games and Flash content in the Internet pages require a lot of processing power, which causes the CPU to go to the extremes and as a consequence heat builds up inside the Macbook. MacBooks (especially Air models) are known for poor inside ventilation.\n", "Q: Low-res photos when transferred from iPhone I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 8.1.0\nWhen I take photos using the built-in camera app, and transfer them off my phone using DropBox or PhotoSync the photos mostly end up as low-res versions. Not all of them, but about 90%.\nI've spent some time trying to work out what is going on and its melting my brain.\nThings I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem is related somehow to the iPhone camera app as it doesn't happen with Camera+.\n\n*The photos do exist on my phone at full-res. If I plug my phone into the laptop with the USB cable, a drive gets mounted and I can get to my photos, copy them off and they are there basking in their high-res glory. That rules out any dumb stuff like 'was I using the front-facing camera' or 'have you set the phone to store photos at low-res'.\n\n*If I use DropBox or PhotoSync they come through as (mostly) low-res.\n\n*I'm not doing anything with iCloud as I know that causes lower-res versions.\nAny help would be appreciated as it is doing my head in!\n\nA: I believe the problem was fixed in either iOS 8.1.2 or possibly 8.1.1. \nRunning iOS 8.1.2, I have tested the same photos from my Camera Roll that gave me the issues described and they now transfer at the correct resolution.\n", "Q: Intermittent Static / Garbage External Display On Wake and Boot?

That's the one used in the thread.\n\nA: For iOS 12 and later:\nStarting at the screen with the all the messages you have sent to/received from the contact, tap the contact icon at the top of the screen (this can either be the picture you assigned for the given contact, or a gray circle with the first letter of the contact's name, if you have not assigned a contact image). After clicking this icon, a small menu bar will appear below the contact icon with three options, in gray: audio, FaceTime, and info; click info. The next screen will have similar options, but this time in blue. Once again, click info.\nYou should now be able to see the information for the given contact. Check where the phone numbers are listed – one of them should have a gray RECENT tag next to it. This is the number you are looking for – it denotes the phone number that you either got the most recent message from, or sent the most recent message to.\nNote that if you are looking in the Contacts app, you will not see the RECENT tag. You must go through the Messages app in order to see this.\nFor earlier versions of iOS:\nWhen typing in a contact name while creating a new message in the Messages app, if the contact sheet for that person has more than one number (or email addresses too) it'll display a list of all numbers. From there you can select which number you'd like to send the message to for that specific contact.\nIf you've already sent a message and wish to determine what number or email address you're using, simply tap on the message -> details -> the \"i\" icon. The contact sheet will display the currently used number/email in blue (the other numbers will be black).\n\nA: For iOS if you follow the I symbol in the upper right hand corner of the message screen it will take you to a place where the contact name is given. Click on the name âne a list of all their numbers will show up. Next to the number that is related to the message you are inquiring about will have the word \"recent\" posted next. Apparently recent doesn't mean it is their most recent number like I had first assumed.\n", "Q: How long can I safely leave my Macbook Pro running? I've set up my Macbook Pro 2011 to run a linux home server through virtualbox. I noticed that this laptop seems to get hot after a few hours compared to my previous laptop (toshiba, windows 8) which I could leave running for days and it never heated up. I am curious though how long I can safely run my Macbook without putting it to sleep? (I have NoSleep installed) I have no problems rebooting once a week or so, just want to know for certain if this actually necessary, cause otherwise I'd put a fan on it and stick it in a corner and forget about it. CPU usage seems to be around 10% when running the server from what Activity Monitor is telling me.\n\nA: Laptops weren't developed with acting as servers in mind.\nThe overall-quality of the integrated components is lower than those of common servers. Additionally redundancy for important parts (like the cooling system etc.) is not given.\nEspecially consumer hard disks and the whole cooling system aren't designed to be run 24/7 a week and guarantee a long lifespan.\nThe in-case temperature will be generally higher than in a normal server.\nThis will effect particularly low-cost hard disks. The durability of hard disks may decrease with higher temperatures. (Opposite standpoint: Google)\nNamely the Macbook Pro 2011 (i own one myself) heats up fast.\nI always would advise to get a (cheap) MacMini, set it up headless and store in  a vibration-free place.\nIf you insist on using your MBP as server, use something like SMC Fan Control (as mentioned/advised by yourself and dwightk , choose a vibration-free place and don't close the lid. Most laptops rely on losing some of their heat through the keyboard. Try to disable the discrete graphics card by turning off 2D/3D acceleration in your VirtualBox VM (please check this ticket).\n\nA: It should be fine setting it and forgetting it. You might want to manually raise the minimum fan speed just a bit. It is usually running at about 2000rpm for noise reasons, but if you bump the minimum to 3000 it will keep the computer cooler. You can use SMC Fan Control or (I use) iStat Menus to adjust the minimum fan speed. \n", "Q: iTunes fails to sync I just bought a new iPhone. I'm trying to sync music to it. iTunes get stuck in \"Waiting for changes to be applied...\" for what seems like an endless period of time.\nFurthermore all of the songs appear on my phone, but they have the cloud icon next to them, which means they aren't actually present on the phone, only the metadata is.\nPhotos and other data syncs without a problem.\nI've tried unchecking the \"Sync Music\" button in iTunes, but now it still hangs.\nHow do I even start to figure out what's gone wrong?

You can see how to do that in this video. If the link does not work, you can find the video on youtube by searching for: \"how to burn OS X Lion to USB DVD\". \nPut a USB stick into your Mac (8 GB minimum) and go to Disk Utility. Make the USB bootable following these steps: select erase data, create a single partition, click options and choose the first option (GUID).

That is, is there a difference between the Yosemite install \"app\" that I would get on the Mac App Store, between the one I would get on a MacBook Air vs. on a MacBook Pro?\nTrying to download it on my Air and install it clean on my Pro.\n\nA: The Install App that you download from the Mac App Store is a universal installer that isn't tied to a specific model/build.  Similar to the retail installation discs from earlier operating system releases.  It will install properly on any supported systems that meet the requirements.\nSo yes, as long as the installer is from the Mac App Store then you should be able to copy it to a thumb drive and install it on any supported Macs.\n", "Q: Turn by turn navigation GPX file app We wanna start doing car rallys and these routes are delivered using a GPX files.\nWhat we are looking for is an app that can make a route from our home to the start of the gpx file and then start navigating the GPX route.\n\nA: Gpx Navigator\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Getting Started.

Excuse me for my english, I'm french and I try to find a solution for my new Mac Mini buy in December. My new Mac Mini it's configured with Yosemite 10.10.0. and it's a problem for me because I use some professional music software like Cubase Elements 7 or Studio One 2, it's not compatible for the moment with Yosmeite. I want to downgrade and I read your post and I'm in panic because I view that not possible to downgrade my new Mac Mini in OSX Mavericks. I have created a external bootable usb key with a Mavericks in my other Mac. When i restart on my usb key bootable, appear this symbol \n\nIt's the kernel panic when I try to boot on the usb key. I think it's mean it's not possible to downgrade on Mavericks with this New Mac Mini (end 2014) ?\nActually I'm in OSX 10.10.1, it's possible that the problem come because I'm in this version ?\nThanks for your help and your answers...\n\nA: The general rule is, you cannot instal an OS on a Mac that is older than the Mac itself.\nSee Don't install a version of Mac OS X earlier than what came with your Mac\nThat said, Cubase 7 should run OK on Yosemite, though you will need the Steinberg Installer patch. I don't know Studio One 2 so I can't say on that.\nGoogle did find this from Presonus about it.\nEdit: I also found this, officially qualifying Studio One 2.6.4 as Yosemite-compatible\n\nA: When installing OS X, it automatically check if you qualify for the update with the apple servers (OS X 10.8 and above i think). That is why you can't downgrade OS X by installing older software. I do not know if there's a workaround for it, but I also can't imagine downgrading to OS X 10.9 Maverick from OS X 10.10 Yosemite\n", "Q: How to restore system from network drive? I have a 2014 MacBook Pro.\nI want to restore my OS from a Time Machine backup which is on a shared network volume.\nWhen I restart in recovery (Apple-Opt-R), it boots from internet, but if I try to restore from Time Machine backup, it fails to see the server where the shared volume is. \nDo I need to log/mount the share somehow?\n\nA: The above answers are a bit too complicated for my taste. I actually tried klanomath's answer and failed, maybe because I have an encrypted backup on the network share. But might also have to do with a wrongful URL encryption.\nHowever there is a much easier way. In this step:\n\njust reinstall your OS X. \nAfter that is finished the migration assistant should popup or if it does not, one can create a user, login and then start the migration assistant by hand. \nIn the migration assistant:\n\nchoose \"From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk\". Click Continue, and choose \"Other server\". This will allow you to enter the address of the volume and it will ask you for the password, in case you used an encrypted backup.\nAfter that you can choose what to recover. Beware, if the user you created after the installation has the same name as the one you used in the backup, there will be a conflict. You will then need to choose, whether you would like to keep delete the user or keep the data. \n\nA: UPDATE: On recent versions of macOS (tested with High Sierra 10.13.4) you can restore from a networked drive directly from the \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\" option in the recovery mode. The following steps are not required (but are super awesome!).\n\nPrerequisites:  \n– admin account & password\n– AFP/SMB-share & server IP-address\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Computer to Recovery Mode.\n\n*Open Terminal in the Utilities menu\n\n*At the prompt enter: cd /Volumes\n\n*Create a sub-directory in Volumes as a mount point for your time machine share:\nmkdir TimeMachine\n\n*Enter cd TimeMachine\n\n*Enter pwd. pwd should show /Volumes/TimeMachine\n\n*Mount the network share with your admin loginname & password:\nmount -t afp afp://adminname:password@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine\n\nIf your password contains wonky characters like :@\\/ use URL encoding to protect them\n\n*Enter: ls -la. Note the exact name of your sparsebundle.\n\n*Enter: hdid /Volumes/TimeMachine/NameOfYourSparseBundle.\nYou may enter the first letters of the sparsebundle name and then hit TAB.\nHitting tab should auto-complete the Time Machine sparsebundle name. It may not look the same as above as it escapes spaces and special characters.\n\n*After auto-completing the name, hit return. \nIf you return to the prompt the sparsebundle has been opened.\n\n*Enter exit and ⏎ and quit Terminal.\nExample steps 3-11:\n\n\n*Select Restore From Time Machine Backup and click Continue.\n\n\n*After a search it should show you the Time Machine Backups directory as a volume that contains your backup. Select that (in my example 'Time Machine Backups') and click Continue.\n\n\n*In the next screen you will see all the backups that you can restore from listed by time and date.\n\n\n*Select the backup you want to restore and continue and finally choose your destination disk:\n\n\nA: Recovery mode needs a netboot server (like OS X server app) to serve up that image.\nYou could set one up or you could copy the backup instance to a USB drive and connect it locally.\nFor netboot, I'd recommend deploy studio as your go to solution in terms of ease of use and robustness of the solution.\nAlso, if you just need user files and applications, you could do a clean install of the OS and then make a temporary user account and use migration assistant to copy the real user and files over once the Mac can run it's own OS to perform the network mount.\n", "Q: No game achievements in steam at all Buy the game Monochroma some time ago and no one achievement has earned until I passed it. Already trying to get help in steam forum, but nothing. Maybe anyone have this kind of problem on mac platform with steam games? Thanks for watching!\n\nA: Steam uses OS X's Accessibility API for the Steam Overlay (Shift+Tab screen) and to communicate between the game and Steam.app. You probably enabled it when you installed Steam. Unfortunately, every time you update Steam (this is a bug in OS X) you must uncheck and re-check the box in System Preferences. If you're having this issue on your Mac but not Windows, that's the reason.\nJust go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, unlock using the icon in the bottom left, and uncheck and re-check Steam.\n\nA: I'd try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure all your OSX updates are installed\n\n*Follow 0942v8653's suggestion and toggle off the Accessibility API for steam\n\n*Completely remove Steam\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Reinstall Steam\n\n*Toggle back on the Accessibility API\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThere may well be better ways, but this is my hip-shot guess on this one.\n\nA: You need to give Steam access in the accessibility settings and then you may need to restart Steam and or reinstall.

I went into the event on Google Calendar and edited it - say, I changed the title slightly.  This somehow \"flushed\" the event through and it showed up in Mac Calendar.\nI noticed this problem arose after I decided to re-link my Google account to my Mac since I was having issues with certain contacts not showing up when I wanted to compose a message in Mac Mail.  Per Google's instructions I re-introduced the Google account as a CardDAV account instead of simply as a Google account.  Not sure this has fixed the contacts problem but it did create the problem above with Calendar sync.\nSo for me editing the event in question fixed the problem.  But for the bigger problem described by @Michelle Wedd I do not necessarily have an answer.  Maybe she can provide an answer if she has been able to fix the problem.\n\nA: this is happening to me only with events created using the apple calendar app. not with events created in google calendar on a pc browser. as such, i can't help but think it's a problem with the calendar app and not on google's end. whenever i add an event and go to edit it, the app crashes. over, and over and over again. so frustrating!\n", "Q: Is Time Machine sufficient in the case of a reformat?

This is also indicated on the time scale on the bottom right side.\nIf you now want to restore just the blue Adobe folder highlight it and click \"Restore\" and it will be copied to your main volume overwriting any previous file/folder there.\n", "Q: How can I use an old mac as an external display using software? I want to use a \"space\" or \"application\" with another computer on the network. Just the UI not keyboard and mouse.\nThe other goal is to add a pseudo screen, without getting an extra monitor.

The VIPs folder on iOS and OS X seems to have very different behavior.  \nOn iOS it shows only messages from VIPs that are also in the inbox.  On OS X it shows messages from all VIPs in every mailbox.  \nIs there any way to get the VIP folder in OS X to act like the one in iOS?\n\nA: It’s obscure:\n\n\n*\n\n*expand the VIP mailbox so the mailbox list on the left shows all your VIPs — each one has a separate mailbox\n\n*go up to the View menu, select Sort By (!), and down the bottom you can choose Inbox Only or All Mailboxes\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*despite appearing to be specific to each VIP, the setting seems to affect all of them at once\n\n*you seem to have to click off a VIP for the setting to show\n\n\nMail 8.2\n", "Q: Can't see family sharing invitation on iPad mini I created a Family Sharing invitation and sent it to an email address. In a new iPad mini (running iOS 8.1.2) I find the email message and click on the \"View Invitation\" link.  It immediately takes me to the iCloud settings, but there are no details about the invitation and no indication about how I should proceed. This iPad has not been previously associated with any Apple ID. How can I associate this device with the Apple ID associated with the invitation?\n\nA: Confirm that your device is running the version of iOS that you think that it is under Settings > General\nIt might help to associate devices with that Apple ID, or at least log in to iTunes with the Apple ID to make sure that everything about the Apple ID works\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204074\nYou can also get to the invitation from Settings > iCloud > Family Sharing\nhere is info from the start\nhttp://www.iphonehacks.com/2014/09/setup-family-sharing-iphone-ipad-ios-8.html\nI was able to resolve all of my issues.\n", "Q: How do I change permissions of folders on a hard drive from a booted USB drive I am trying to save my files on my Hard Drive that has a crashed OS.

I have an Excel spreadsheet that is pulling in data from an external CSV. I want it to refresh every time I open it, because eventually it's going to be pulling data in from 20 different files. At the moment it says\n\nsecurity warning \"data connections have been disabled\"\n\nAnd then when I override it, it prompts me to reselect the file in Finder.\nIt sounds like this is pretty easy in Windows Excel, you pretty much just need to enable a setting in the 'Trust Center'. Only, Excel 2011 has no trust center, and as far as I can tell, no way to actually do this automatically.\n\nA: Refreshing a data table in your Excel workbook\nIf your query table is linked to a data source, you can update the data in your workbook on demand so that it reflects the current state of the data source. On the Ribbon’s Data tab, go to the External Data Sources group and click Refresh button’s triangle to display a pop-up menu, where you can choose from the options.\n", "Q: ssh -X without/with using xquartz I would like to know if OSX supports ssh -X right out of the box?\nUsing the command launches XQuartz and interestingly both are NOT working: \ne.g. displaying pdf files returning :\nevince foo.pdf \n\n** (evince:1341): WARNING **: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=58045ffa2d1f3dc82398e1eb00000008 --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: EOF in dbus-launch reading address from bus daemon\\n\nFailed to get bus connection: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=58045ffa2d1f3dc82398e1eb00000008 --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: EOF in dbus-launch reading address from bus daemon\\n\n\n\nA: The '-X' parameter to ssh instructs ssh to open an XWindow session, which is why xquartz is launched automatically.\nYou can ssh to a remote server without -X and interact with it on a command line, however, to forward the XWindow display needs XQuartz.\nTo debug the problem you are seeing you may want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure there are no errors when you connect to the server (i.e. 'X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0')\n\n*Test other X window commands after you establish a valid connection (like xeyes or gvim)\n\n*Check the value of $DISPLAY.\n\n", "Q: 15\" MacBook Pro to 27\" iMac monitor Can I hook up my 15\" macbook Pro thunderbolt to my 27\" iMac thunderbolt, and operate the MacBook pro in Windows 7 in order to have a large monitor to run AutoCad?\nBoth computers are running OSX Yosemite and Bootcamp Windows 7.\n\nA: According to Target Display Mode: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), you can't do it.\n\n8.

I also happen to have a 333MHz tray-loading G3 model #M4984 and am wondering if I can put the HD from the 400MHz into the 333MHz, just to use to boot up and back up my data onto a flash drive.  \nHere are the specs:\niMac #1 (the one with all my data on it):  400MHz slot-loading G3, Model #M5521, 20.4GB hard drive (may not be the original HD - think it originally came with a 13GB), 320MB memory (256 and 64 cards), dvd drive, serial #RN9445BXHCW, and is running OS 10.3.9.  The hard drive says on it: Maxtor HD model # 92049U3, 20.4GB, manufactured 15 July 2000.  \niMac #2: 333MHz tray-loading G3, Model #M4984, 6GB hard drive, 288MB memory, CD drive, serial #XB9361VUGSQ, and is running OS 9.2.2.  \nThe questions we have are whether the 400MHZ iMac hard drive can be put into the 333MHz iMac and, if so, whether it would be able to boot/run it given it is running OS 10.3.9.  We are trying to do this ourselves, as we are money-limited, and my husband is capable of changing the hard drives, however the 333MHz iMac is the only other machine/method we have to use to try to recover the data.  Any info you could provide on the compatibility of the two hard drives/iMacs would be very much appreciated.\nThanks a lot,\nCindi\n\nA: Well, while newer iMac drive will work in older one, there is no guarantee it will boot.\nThere was a limitation during the times of Classic Mac OS on size of boot partition which has to be below 8GB. You have Mac OS X 10.3.9 on that drive so I can't say if it still applies. And maybe if it does apply you might had it partitioned just the way it need to be to overcome it.\nThen again getting HDD from that iMac and into it is not that easy. Not that it really hard but still it is not a Mac Pro or standard PC case.\nAnd also keep in mind that you might just break cables when disassembling since it is long time when it was put together and they probably aged and aged cables don't like when you bend them.\nSo if you are not afraid of the idea of making another iMac unusable or brave, experienced or just curious then go ahead and try. Do not forget to remove power cord, then press power button to get excessive electricity from capacitors off and get yourself grounded.\nStill there is an option and it is just buying a used (they are cheap since practically nobody use them) or getting for free a USB enclosure (it could be USB 1.1 or USB 2 — it doesn't matter since that iMac only has USB 1.1 ports anyway yet USB2 enclosure will work too. It even can be 5.25\" external CD case provided it internally uses PATA/IDE interface) case for 3.5\" PATA/IDE HDD.\nAfter putting your HDD into it you should see content of it. Provided it is not dead, of course.\nSo good luck and keep us posted.\n", "Q: Can I use HDMI for audio only without video? When I connect an HDMI display to my computer, it uses it as a display. I can't figure out how to use the HDMI cable for audio only and only use my laptop monitor. Is this possible?\n\nA: If all you want is to have your desktop confined to your computer's screen, go to System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement, and check Mirror Displays. That'll make it so that your HDMI display only acts as a mirror of the desktop you already have, rather than an extension of it.\n\nA: There is no way to transmit only audio data via HDMI.\nThe HDMI white paper (page 10) notes that the signal is sent in HDMI packets consisting of both audio and video. Despite all the pins, there are no separate audio and video signals, so there are also no HDMI A/V splitter cables.\nThe only way to get around this is to send blank video data (e.g. a black screen). I'm not sure exactly why you want only the audio, but here are my suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're connecting it to an audio receiver, just send it along without worrying about the video.\n\n*If you're connecting it to a TV, and don't want the TV to show your desktop, you can extend your desktop (turn off mirroring) and either have a blank desktop show up or put up any image you want on full screen while you do whatever you need to do on your MBP screen. That part's really up to you.\n\n\nHope that's helpful.\n\nA: I use an \"HDMI Splitter 1 in 2 Out\" device (not KVM) for this purpose.\nreasoning:\n\n\n*\n\n*send audio to a receiver without fudging with a mirrored setup on the\nOS side\n\n*avoid spdif because \"Optical standards are limited to basically\n\"LPCM\" 2 channel only.. .ever.... period. The only way to transmit\n5.1 audio and it's LIMITED to 5.1 only, is via compressed bitstreamed DTS/DD\" quote u/DHJudas\n\n", "Q: Need help with update to latest Git using Terminal I was trying to update to the latest Git version in my Terminal. I've no clue what I did and all I remember was that I removed the previous installed Git I think because when i run the following commands:\nwhich git => /usr/local/bin/git\ngit --version => -bash: /usr/bin/git: No such file or directory\nbrew install git => Warning: git-2.2.1 already installed\nbrew doctor => Your system is ready to brew.\nbrew link git => Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.2.1\n$PATH => \"/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:‌​/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\n\nMy question is what should i do next so that I can use Git ?\n\nA: I suspect that git's location is still cached in /usr/bin (the default location). To check this, type:\ntype git\n\nThe result will likely be:\ngit is hashed (/usr/bin/git)\n\nTo fix this, you can simply log out & back in, or clear the hash for git with the following:\nhash -d git\n\nNow, running git should work properly.\n", "Q: Programmatically send text message through Messages app on OS X 10.10 With OSX 10.10 you can now send and receive text messages through your phone, from your mac. Is it possible to do this programatically? Either via applescript or a reverse engineered API?\n\nA: There is quite a few good examples out there for using Applesccript to send iMessages.  I haven't found one yet that will work to a number via sms, the below script only works with iMessage.  Also it limited to the number(s) in your contacts(buddy list) and will error out if the buddy/number isn't in your contacts.  Here's one that I use to send notifications of a server backup complete.\nCreate an applescript named \"sendMessage.scpt\" with the following code:\non run {targetBuddyPhone, targetMessage}\ntell application \"Messages\"\n    set targetService to 1st service whose service type = iMessage\n    set targetBuddy to buddy targetBuddyPhone of targetService\n    send targetMessage to targetBuddy\nend tell\nend run\n\nThen from terminal.app run this command to send iMessage:\nosascript /path/to/sendMessage.scpt 12345550123 \"Your Text Message to Send\"\n\njust change 12345550123 to the number your sending to.\nLink to original guide from stackeoverflow\n\nA: send.scpt\non run {phoneNumber, message}\n    tell application \"Messages\"\n    send message to buddy phoneNumber of service \"SMS\"\n    end tell\nend run\n\nrun from terminal like this:\nosascript send.scpt +48500123456 'hello andi!'\nthis works both with iMessage and standard SMS when you have enabled on your iPhone the option Text Message Forwarding by setting your e.g macbook device.\n\nA: Using:\ntell application \"Messages\"\n    get name of every service\nend tell\n\nI noticed that I have \"SMS\" as a 4th option (yours may be different). So then I used:\nlaunch application \"Messages\"\ntell application \"Messages\"\n     activate --steal focus\n\n     set targetBuddy to \"12345550123\"\n     set targetService to id of service \"SMS\"\n     set textMessage to \"Just a test\"\n\n     set theBuddy to buddy targetBuddy of service id targetService\n     send textMessage to theBuddy\nend tell\n\nThis lets me send a text message over SMS Relay. I'm not 100% sure that I did this correctly, but it does work if targetService points to \"SMS\". Now to convert it to script that works from the terminal.\n", "Q: Changing Icloud user name I have an Iphone 4s that is linked to an Icloud account with an old email account that I no longer have access to.  Is there a way to delete that old account and recreate  a new account with my new email address?\n\nA: The issue is with the Apple ID used to activate the iCloud Service. An Apple ID is simply an email address that you sign into Apple with and, by extension, use set up Apple’s auxilary services (iCloud, iTunes Store Purchases, etc). \n\nIs there a way to delete that old account?\n\nApple usually won’t let you delete an old Apple ID. You need to contact Apple ID Support to inquire. If you wish to purge Apple’s servers of all the information associated with that Apple ID, you can.\n\nIs there a way to…recreate a new account with my new email address?\n\nYes. \nOption One:\nCreate a new Apple ID using your new email address. This is the easiest solution.\nOption Two:\nChange the primary email address associated with your Apple ID account. You don’t need access to the old email address in order to change your Apple ID. This is preferable if you have old purchases or other information you wish to keep.* From Apple ID FAQ:\n\nI no longer have an email address that was also my Apple ID. Can I still use the email address as my Apple ID?\nApple recommends you change your Apple ID to your current, working email address. This will not create another Apple ID, it will only\n  change it to your working email address. See Changing the name you use\n  for your Apple ID if you'd like more information.\n\n*It’s important to note that you cannot merge Apple IDs. Period (period). \n\nA: First step, turn off FindMyiPhone if it's on.  (you don't have to but it will be easier)\nthen go to appleid.apple.com and click \"Manage Apple Id\".  Now go back to the iPhone and change the login's for iCloud, iTunes and Appstore, Facetime, Messages and Game Center.  Turn find my iPhone back on anytime after you change the iCloud login.\n\nA: Just been through torture trying to turn off 'find my iphone' and delete things.  Fact is, because I foolishly changed my icloud login on my mac before doing the other devices,  it would simply not let me past the old (now defunct) login email address.  So:   I connected my iphone to itunes using my USB lead and went into backup.  First question asked by the machine:  'this iphone is sync'd to another itunes account, do you want to change?   I answered 'Yes' and the problem seemed to go away.  Hope this helps.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro crashed many times Does anyone have any ideas to suggest me?

See my answer here for more details.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the panics persist without any third party drivers, then it’s a hardware problem. \n\n*If other panics include “type...GPU Panic” along with nvidia dependencies in the backtrace, then it’s a hardware problem. \n\n\nBest of luck. \n", "Q: Can one use Apple's Bootcamp drivers on a Parallels VM? So this just occurred to me: What if I installed Windows as a Parallels VM and used bootcamps drivers instead of the parallels drivers, would this work?\nSomething tells me it won't, and that this is a really stupid question, in part because the VM is not actually your machine, but then again, it's a VM working ON the actual machine... no?\n\nA: This is unlikely to work, though I haven't tried it. If I may esplain...\nThe bootcamp drivers are for windows running on a specific number of Apple Macintosh computer models. In other words the drivers are for specific computers.\nThe Parallels VM is an emulated PC that may or may not have any compatibility with the Apple hardware.\nIt's kind of like going to the Dell drivers download site, downloading drivers for an (lets say...) Optiplex 9020 and than hoping those drivers will work on the new HP you just brought.\n", "Q: iCloud password reset How do I change the Apple iCloud password that is synched to a computer no longer available to me?\nI am trying to backup my contacts to my new computer.  I have loaded the latest iTunes application on my notebook.  updates my iPhone 4S iOS8.  The mobile icon doesn't appear in iTunes.  The folder shows up in the drive tree.  \nSo I am trying to backup everything to an iCloud account however I can't access it.\n\nA: If you do not have the password for an iCloud account, and also do not have the means to reset it via appleid.apple.com page, then you can't do anything with that iCloud account.\nAlso, it seems you have a couple of issues: iTunes not recognising your iPhone?\nPD: Why would you want to backup everything to an iCloud account you can no longer access?\n", "Q: I overwrote OSX with Linux by accident So here is what happened. I installed Ubuntu onto a flashdrive hoping to be able to dual boot Linux/OSX. I burned Ubuntu onto the flash drive on my desktop PC (windows 8.1) with universal USB installer, I believe. I plugged it into my Mac OSX, rebooted, held the option key, and booted from the flash drive (it recognized it as \"windows\" by the way). \nIt then started to install and I must have somehow clicked install onto the hard drive because now both my hard drive and my flash drive are Ubuntu (both recognized as \"windows\" in the boot screen) and I really need to get my Mac OSX back. \nI get this screen every time I boot from the hard drive then get stuck at a blank (looks terminal-ish) screen which doesn't load. \n   \nI can boot from the flash drive and get this.\n   \nIt at least boots into Ubuntu. \n   \nI'm really not experienced with Ubuntu and I really don't want to have to keep Linux, so please if anyone can help me I would appreciate it.\np.s like I said earlier I have a windows 8.1 PC, so I can use that to help fix it if necessary I just really need my OSX back.\nIf you need any more information I'll gladly give it. Here is what it looks like with my flashdrive plugged in when I choose where to boot from.\n   \nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*Need help with linux/restoring to osx!\n\nA: You have two options.  \n\n\n*\n\n*You can restore your OSX using Mac's built-in ⌘ + R.\nThis requires a little explanation, so here it goes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your mac.\n\n*Power-on, while holding down ⌘ + R.  You may release these keys as soon as you see the apple logo.\n\n*When you see the OS X Utilities screen (pictured below), click Reinstall OS X\n\n\n\n*This might take a while, but after you're done, you should have OS X installed.  You can update it to the newest version from the Mac App Store.\n\n\nor...  \n\n\n*You can take your mac to an Apple Store  \nThis should be pretty self-explanatory, due to Apple's good support.\n\nA: The simple way is to turn your Mac in at an authorised service provider or Genius Bar.\nWhat you can try yourself is to make a bootable USB drive with OS X. Since you only have Windows I do not know if this is possible.\nYou could also try to download OS X and place the dmg file on a USB drive, then try to boot from it.\n\nA: It sounds like you don't have a backup of your original OS X setup, and since you also likely don't have the Recovery partition, you can reinstall in the following way from scratch (assuming you have a relatively recent machine):\nSee How to use macOS Recovery for reference - but the relevant steps are below:\nmacOS / OS X Internet Recovery\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac, and hold down Command + R at startup until the Apple logo appears. \n\n\nAfter your computer finishes starting up, you should see a desktop with an OS X menu bar and an OS X Utilities window with the options listed above. If you see a login window or your own desktop instead of the Utilities window, it's possible that you didn't press Command-R early enough. Restart your computer and try again.\nChoose the option you want to use from the Utilities window or the Utilities menu.\nIn order to reinstall OS X, you need to be connected to the Internet using Ethernet or Wi-Fi. If you're using a wireless Internet connection, click the Wi-Fi menu in the upper-right corner of the screen to select a nearby Wi-Fi network. Choose your preferred network name and enter a username and password to join the network if needed.\n\nA: So basically yes you made a rather large mistake. If if you don't have a backup the chances of getting the data back are slim to none. Even if you are willing to pay a number of Hamiltons to a data recovery company Ubuntu has likely overwritten most if not all of your files. Chalk it up to a learning experience (EG always have a current backup. Always) and work on reinstalling your Mac O/S.\nIf you do want to play with Ubuntu it would be much easier to use VMWare, Parallels or the free Virtualbox and run it as a virtual machine inside of your Mac OS.\nIf you really have to have a dual boot, spend some time on the Ubuntu forums looking for advice on dual booting on your Mac.\nBasically you'll have to use GParted (a partition editor) to shrink the Mac partition and add the Linux partition. What you did was overwrite the Mac partitions with your Linux partition. Modifying the partitions is not hard to do but it must be done carefully with attention to detail.\nAnd once you have restored your Mac like Scot said, make a backup.\n", "Q: Why does fan increase slowly its speed at boot and system is so slow? I am given a MacBookAir5,2 [A1466 (EMC 2559)] that is very slow. To give you an idea, a sequence of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on\n\n*Log in and loading the desktop\n\n*Power off from the menu\n\n\ntakes around 10 minutes.\nThe MacBookAir runs quite cool. With $ top I see around ~10% of CPU usage after logging in and ~25% of RAM and sysctl hw.cpufrequency returns 1,800,000,000 without the commas, which I suppose is good. Also, I noticed that fan speed is always at (almost?) full speed.\nSo, after searching around I did a PVRAM/NVRAM reset and an SMC reset.\nPVRAM/NVRAM reset seems to be successful since I get the \"double restart\".\nBut I question the SMC reset. The steps of the procedure are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer. \n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected. (I shut it down having MagSafe plugged in)\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time. \n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time. (I did this, holding them down for <1, ~5 and ~10 second(s).)\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer. (Now, this does NOT work. I have to unplug MagSafe in order for power button to turn on the MacBookAir.)\n\n*Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC. (It does not change states to me.)\nThe strange thing is that when I turn it on, the gray screen appears with the \"loading\" icon. Then, after let's say 10 seconds I can listen to the fan increasing its rotation slowly from its minimum speed to -I guess- the maximum. This increase is quite slow and takes around 10 seconds.\nShould the next step be delivering it to a proper technician or there is something else I can do?\n\nA: Go to iFixit and look up the guide for your Air. You will need to do two things. First is disconnect the battery, second is remove/clean the CPU heatsink before reapplying thermal paste and refitting it. When you've done that you can reconnect the battery and see what happens.\nSMC resets using key combos don't always work - disconnecting the battery does. It might seem drastic but removing the power source is what's needed. If you've an SMC issue (which sounds very likely) this should clear it and cleaning up the CPU cooler will give you something useful to do while any residual voltage is discharging.\n", "Q: How do I clear individual types of browser data in Safari? Prior to upgrading my MacBook Pro to OS X Yosemite, I was able to clear individual types of browser data (such as cookies, visited URLs and website data) in Safari. However, the  \"Clear History and Website Data...\" option in the new version of Safari only lets me choose how far back I want to clean the data; it doesn't let me choose what types of data to clear. How do I enable the option for choosing the data types?\nI'm sure the solution is very simple, but I can't seem to figure it out for the life of me.\n\nA: For cookies: The option to delete all of your cookies stored on your hard drive lies under your under the “Privacy” tab. There, click on “Remove All Website Data…” then click “Remove Now.” To delete individual cookies, click “Details…” under the “Privacy.” From there, find the specific cookie and delete it accordingly.\n", "Q: iOS Updates when bandwidth is restricted I was on a cruise ship in the Caribbean a month ago and needed to keep in touch via email.   \nConnect@sea offered a 300mb plan which I thought would work.  I followed all of their guidelines about what to disable etc. \nAll was going well until...\nI woke up on day 3 and IOS 8.1.1 had downloaded (182mb) and was ready to install.  After the 182 mb download, my wifi package was also empty.  \nI can't find any way that I could have prevented that large automatic download. Is there a way?  (It's true that it doesn't install until you approve it, but it downloads automatically.)\nSuggested in the first answer is to only connect to wifi, download email and disconnect. That method won't work for me. Some of the emails are server generated alarms (I also kept push notifications from the Pingdom app enabled), therefor I was unable to disconnect from wifi except when checking email because I need the email to arrive in real-time.  \nWhat are the best practices when you take your iPhone with you on a cruise?  (it wasn't easy at all actually, there are a lot of controls to use when you don't want to use cellular data, but everything is designed to assume that WIFI is a giant unmetered pipe---not a restricted connection that you don't want to suck data from.)  \n\nA: Regarding the OS update, I seem to remember that filling the iPhone with (songs, books, pictures, apps) to the point where the OS update would not fit was the only way to prevent the OS update from downloading.  On a cruise, where you would likely be taking many pictures, etc, this is not a very amenable solution.\nWhen I've had metered WiFi in the past, I would turn it off except when checking mail and then turn it back off immediately after downloading all the messages.  Depending on how fast your WiFi connection is, even this may or may not have prevented the update from downloading.\nAbout the only thing remaining is to ask the network admin onboard the ship if they could block the software update site as if it were a torrent or porn site.\n", "Q: Boot Camp partition is on lowest brightness and will not change It all started this morning, since I listen to podcasts on YouTube before bed. I barely use my Mac partition, but still update it. I use my Windows partition for most of my stuff.\nI went to bed with the screen dimmed all the way down and went to sleep. When I woke up, my computer was shut down but still perfectly fine. I started up Windows and after the \"Starting Windows\" screen, the screen went black since it is dimmed all the way down and now I can't brighten it back up.\n\nA: Just point a small torch (I used the one in my old mobile phone) to the windows screen where it requires your password to log in and you will see slightly where is the box, click then enter your password and the windows will start then increase the brightness by using F2.\nWorked for me.\n\nA: Go into safe mode, change if so you don't have to \"log\" into Windows with a password or otherwise when Windows starts, the issue is that the brightness F2 key doesn't work until your logged in and Apple drivers load. If Windows starts, then F2 will work to brighten up screen.\n\nA: Have you installed the Boot Camp drivers for Windows? These give Windows access to the extra keyboard functions such as the brightness control you need. If you haven't then boot into OS X, go to Boot Camp Assistant in Utilities and it will download and install the specific drivers for your model onto a USB stick for you. Alternatively download them from Apple's support page.\nIf you restart the Mac does the built-in display remain at its dark setting? If so resetting PRAM will bring the display back to its default brightness. Hold option/alt-cmd-p-r when you hear the startup chime, keep holding until it restarts. Windows may override the brightness setting once booted up but this shouldn't be a problem if you've got the Boot Camp drivers installed.\n", "Q: Can I use a 3.5mm mic in an ipod touch? I have a microphone with a 3.5 mm jack. Can I use this for recording in garage band in my ipod touch. Thanks for the help.\n\nA: Not directly - you need, at minimum, a plug adaptor to take the 2-way connector on the mic to the Apple standard 4-way connector.\nThere are a lot more advanced methods too, involving actual 'live' interfaces designed to do just that - it really depends on what kind of mic it is as to what interface would be best, though if its default connector is a 2-way mini-jack, then my guess would be it's a non-powered electret condenser, which are not always the best for music recording. \nI'd consider having a look at some of the IK Multimedia iRig devices or alternatively, just start from this Google search for simpler connectors\n", "Q: Deleting notes in ipod All my notes are synced to my gmail account and can be accessed. Now if I delete all my notes on my ipod, would it also delete all my notes in my gmail because it syncs. \nI do not want the notes in gmail to be deleted.Thanks for the help.\n\nA: If you delete the notes from the app, then yes, they'll be deleted from Gmail. However, if you just want to take the notes off the iPod, you can just switch off \"Notes\" for your Gmail account under Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\n", "Q: Terminal not beeping on bell character I'm running a nearly vanilla installation of OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 with the usual Homebrew, MacPorts, and Fink.  I have barely anything installed with these utilities.  For some reason, my Terminal.app is not producing an audible bell, even with the preference enabled.  I have since enabled the visual bell, and at first it didn't produce a result either until I disabled the \"Only when sound is muted\" option.  I do not have my system's default audio device muted; it is in fact at 100% volume and fully functional.  It seems like Terminal.app is under the impression that my system audio is muted for some reason.  How can I get my Terminal.app to beep like it did in past versions of OS X?\n\nA: There are several ways to do this on Terminal, but first make sure that in Terminal preferences > Advanced you have ticked the Audible bell option, otherwise you won't hear anything.  Now you can do any of the following to get the bell:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ echo ^G (hold down the ctrl key followed by V and then G to get ^G)\n\n*$ printf \"\\a\" or $ printf \\\\a\n\n*$ echo -e \"\\a\" or $ echo -e \\\\a\n\n*$ tput bel\nFYI: the way you installed Yosemite, whether via Homebrew, Macports etc., shouldn't affect this issue.\n\nA: I came here via a search as I was experiencing exactly the same issue and tried all the steps suggested to Clay Freeman with the same results. \nWhat worked for me was going into Systems Preferences / Sound, where I noticed that the slider for Alert Volume was at its leftmost setting. Sliding that to the right resolved the problem.\n\nA: *\n\n*On your Terminal what are the Bell options you have set in Preferences > Advanced?  As I said before, Audible bell and Visual bell should be ticked, otherwise that's the problem.\n\n*Did you check that you can play other system sounds?  The standard system sound files for alerts are located in /System/Library/Sounds, and can be played from Terminal using afplay.  Try doing the following\n$ afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff\nYou should be able to hear the sound.\n\n\n*If not, then it could be a problem with value for the bell setting in the terminfo for terminal - terminfo is an internal database of terminal settings files that Terminal.app uses to perform actions for different terminal types - a collection of different settings files for different terminals.  The standard one is xterm-256color - you can find out which one by doing\n$ echo $TERM\nyou should see xterm-256color.  The settings file for this terminal is a binary file located in a numbered subfolder of /usr/share/terminfo, to find out which one do\n$ mdfind xterm-256color\n\nYou should see several lines, the first which should be something like /usr/share/terminfo/78, in which case that's where the settings file for xterm-256color is located.  Since it is a binary file you won't be able to read it out literally, but must do the following\n$ infocmp\n\nto print it out in human-readable form.  This is a long string of key-value pairs for different settings - to find out the bell settings for your terminal you can either manually scan the output for bel=^G or do\n$ infocmp | grep bell\n\nand you will see something like bel=^G, blink=\\E[5m, bold=\\E[1m, cbt=\\E[Z, civis=\\E[?25l.  The bel=^G key-pair is saying that using echo or printf followed by ^G (the key combination ctrl+V+G) from your terminal will produce the audible bell (using whatever standard system sound you are using, e.g. the Funk sound /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff.  Using tput you can use the capability name bel to sound the bell also by doing $ tput bel.\nOK, so tell me what you see when you have done this.  If the file is corrupted or damaged or the value is missing, or there is something you should be able to identify it.\n", "Q: Can I play Blu-ray discs directly on a MacBook using an external drive?

I have my Mac OS X Yosemite system configured in spanish, but I have an app with a horrible spanish translation, and I would like to run it (and just this app) in english. How could I do that?\n\nA: So... there is two ways: change the main system language for some time or use this freeware, Language Switcher, which helps to launch single applications with a different language. Also you can try this variant - App Language Chooser.\n\nA: You may try to move translation files out of application bundle.\nFirst make a copy of Your app (just in case). Then go to the Resources folder inside this app-copy (right click -> show package content -> enter Content -> enter Resources). Here You'll probably find directory called like: es_ES.lproj/es_lproj/es_MX.lproj (or similar) - delete this dir. Launch this app-copy and check the language.\n\nThis is a bit overkill since You can use -AppleLanguages switch.

It is the full body aluminium with the Superdrive. \nPer Apple, this is my machine:\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009)\n\nThe only drives I see when holding down option are Macintosh HD and Recovery.

When booting from a USB disk that seemed to be bootable, it would display a \"no\" symbol ( e.g.  ⃠  ...) after trying to boot into it and would then boot into the OS. I tried wulfderay's suggestion (the currently voted answer) to reset the pram and it didn't help.\nI came across this installation tutorial and figured out that #5 in Step 1 of creating the drive had been wrong in my case. It's important to create the partition as \"GUID Partition Table\" rather than either of the other two. Mine was previously \"Master Boot Record\" as a partition scheme.\nI'm guessing this could be the edge case that a few of us have run into. I confirmed the SHA of my Yosemite download and used the same one to re-create the bootable USB, so this was the only difference.\n\nA: After booting with the Option method, plug in the USB drive after the existing disks appear.  I think this relates to protecting the system from USB viruses: you're normally only allowed to connect the drive after the system is powered-on... this is my logic anyway!\n\nA: You might try resetting the pram on your mac.\nI understand that startup disk settings are stored there.\nIf the disk is bootable on other Macs, it stands to reason that it should boot on this one. \nYou can reset the pram by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Mac. \n\n*Locate the following four keys:  option,\ncommand, p and r. You'll need them in the next step. \n\n*Power on the Mac, then immediately hold option, command, p and r.\nYou need to do this before the grey screen appears.\n\n*Hold down the keys until you hear the startup sound twice, then release them.\n\n*Plug in the bootable USB stick, restart the Mac, and hold option.\n\n\nI can't guarantee that it'll work, but it won't hurt, so it's worth a try.\n\nA: Something similar has occurred to me before but then I identified that the .dmg of the OS X file was damaged which made the created bootable USB useless. Please make sure you check the SHA1 hash of the downloaded dmg with someone else to rule this possibility out.\n\nA: Only thing that worked for me was to create the same Yosemite boot disk on a firewire drive. \nMacPro Desktop Tower: OS X v10.9.5; 2x3.2GHz Quad Core Intel Xeon, 14GM 800 MHz DDR2, MacPro3,1.\n", "Q: How to open a new c++ file with a predefined template in Sublime Text? I am keen to know if there is a way to open not an empty new file but a new file with some predefined template. I participate in online coding contests and for every new file (which I save as a '.cpp'), I have to Cmd+C and Cmd+V all the preprocessor directives i.e. #include <..>'s and #define's from one of my earlier '.cpp' file. Is there a way by which I can have all these things written to some file and every new file that I save as a c++ file this data gets loaded onto it thus saving my copy-pasting/retyping. Eclipse IDE has this feature, I wanted to know if its possible somehow in Sublime Text too. Thanx!\n\nA: You should use a snippet. For instance, you can define a new snippet and trigger it with !initcpp. Then you open a new file, type !initcpp, hit ⇥ and your are ready to go.\nTo define a new one go to Tools → New Snippet…\nFrom Sublime Text: Snippets.\nSnippets can be stored under any package’s folder, but to keep it simple while you’re learning, you can save them to your Packages/User folder.\nSnippets File Format\nSnippets typically live in a Sublime Text package. They are simplified XML files with the extension .sublime-snippet.\nThe structure of a typical snippet is as follows (including the default hints Sublime Text inserts for your convenience):\n<snippet>\n    <content><![CDATA[Type your snippet here]]></content>\n    <!-- Optional: Tab trigger to activate the snippet -->\n    <tabTrigger>xyzzy</tabTrigger>\n    <!-- Optional: Scope the tab trigger will be active in -->\n    <scope>source.python</scope>\n    <!-- Optional: Description to show in the menu -->\n    <description>My Fancy Snippet</description>\n</snippet>\n\nThe snippet element contains all the information Sublime Text needs in order to know what to insert, whether to insert and when. Let’s look at each of these parts in turn.\ncontent\nThe actual snippet. Snippets can range from simple to fairly complex templates. We’ll look at examples of both later.\nKeep the following in mind when writing your own snippets:\n\n*\n\n*If you want to get a literal $, you have to escape it like this: \\$.\n\n*When writing a snippet that contains indentation, always use tabs. When the snippet is inserted, the tabs will be transformed into spaces if the option translateTabsToSpaces is true.\n\n*The content must be included in a <![CDATA[…]]> section. Snippets won’t work if you don’t do this!\n\n*The content of your snippet must not contain ]]> because this string of characters will prematurely close the <![CDATA[…]]> section, resulting in an XML error. To work around this pitfall, you can insert an undefined variable into the string like this: ]]$NOT_DEFINED>. This modified string passes through the XML parser without closing the content element’s <![CDATA[…]]> section, but Sublime Text will replace $NOT_DEFINED with an empty string before inserting the snippet into your file. In other words, ]]$NOT_DEFINED> in your snippet file content will be written as ]]> when you trigger the snippet.\n\ntabTrigger\nDefines the sequence of keys that must be pressed to insert this snippet. After typing this sequence, the snippet will kick in as soon as you hit the ⇥ key.\nA tab trigger is an implicit key binding.\nscope\nScope selector determining the context where the snippet will be active. See Scopes for more information.\ndescription\nUsed when showing the snippet in the Snippets menu. If not present, Sublime Text defaults to the file name of the snippet.\nWith this information, you can start writing your own snippets as described in the next sections.\n", "Q: In Bash, can I output text from cut into a new command?

I'm using an image editing program, and I'm trying to do a large clone.  This requires me to keep the mouse button down (virtually, this is on a trackpad) for a long period of time, and any mistake means I have to start all over.  (Not to mention, if I get to the edge of the trackpad and still need to push the pointer further I am in trouble!) So I have been looking for a way to keep the software thinking the button is down without having to keep my finger touching the trackpad for an extended period of time.\nI read this answer here, which seemed to offer a solution to the problem.  However, perhaps I am not understanding what it really means to \"double tap\", because after setting the option exactly as given in the answer, two literal taps on the trackpad in quick succession do nothing to enable dragging.  When I do it in my image editor, I see two modifications made to my image, as if I made two separate taps.  If I try it on the top of a window where I would normally click and drag to drag the window around, dragging does not start and the taps are completely ignored.  I already have single tap to click enabled, so I know a tap is being registered properly.  Setting the \"Enable Dragging (with Drag Lock)\" seems to have had absolutely no effect.\nIs there something else I am missing?\n\nA: After some experimentation, I discovered that it isn't quite a double-tap that is required to activate the drag lock.  The second tap of the double-tap need to be held down until the drag is started instead of being released immediately.\nSo the sequence of steps look something like this:\ntouch trackpad\nrelease after ~0.1s (or some short period of time)\nwait ~0.1s \ntouch trackpad\nbegin drag\nrelease touchpad\n\nAnd then when I am done dragging:\ntouch trackpad\nrelease after ~0.1s\n\n\nA: Did you mean to drag something over the screen?

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been installed on the virtual machine. In ubuntu I use Emacs 24.3.1 as editor.\nOnce emacs of ubuntu is launched, the Kill Menu (see Edit -> Paste from Kill Menu) is empty. If I want to copy a text from Chrome under Mac to Emacs under ubuntu, I can use Command+C (which saves the text into the Kill Menu of Emacs) then Command+V or Ctrl+V.\nI can also copy and paste a text within Emacs by using Command+C (which also saves the text into the Kill Menu of Emacs) then Command+V or Ctrl+V.\nHowever, the problem is, after I copy and paste something within Emacs, I could not copy and paste a test from Mac to Emacs anymore by Command+C then Command+V or Ctrl+V: Command+C under a Chrome page of Mac can not save the text into the Kill Menu anymore. Consequently, Command+V or Ctrl+V within Emacs always pastes the last element in the Kill Menu, which is not what I want.\nSo I have to close and re-launch Emacs to clean the Kill Menu to enable the copy-paste from Mac to Emacs of ubuntu, which is tedious...\nCould anyone help?\n\nA: I think there are two issues here. One is how to copy from Mac to Ubuntu. That is the work of the VM. You have to set it up and oftentimes it depends on capturing the mouse/keyboard (you may want to look it up in your vmware config for the specific VM you are using, I mean, the one running Ubuntu). From what you said, it looks like this part is working ok.\nThen there is a question about the Kill-Yank ring in Emacs. Usually, you kill (cut) using Command+K (it kills from the cursor position to the end of the current line; you can kill characters with Control+K or words with Option(alt)+K) and you paste with Command+Y (it will paste everything that you had killed just before yanking it up). So, unless it is somehow configured differently, whatever you copy or cut with Command+C or Command+X on your Mac side (provided it is correctly configured on VMWare) should be available on Emacs by using Command+Y not Command+V. \nHope it helps.\nP.S. There is also another trick: Ubuntu tends to think of the mouse as a peripheral having three buttons. Selecting something (just selecting, not copying or cutting it) and pressing the middle button normally pastes it at the cursor position (I don't know, nevertheless, how your VMWare-hosted Ubuntu would differentiate your middle button. Sometimes, it means pressing both buttons at once. On some configurations, you will need to press a modifier (Option?) while you click the secondary button.\n", "Q: What does \"each user must type in their password before they will be able to unlock the disk\" mean?

Even the  previously not 'enabled' users are available by 'user switching' or a 'second' login screen.\n\n*After logging in with an enabled user your system will be encrypted.\n\n\n*You may enable users subsequently by clicking the lock and 'Enable User...'\n\n\n*Enter the user's password and click OK, then Done\n\n\n*All users enabled subsequently will reappear at the first login screen, may unlock the disk and log in as usual.\n\nA: FileVault encrypts the hard drive -- these users are able to decrypt the drive, though standard unix access controls will prevent non-admins from looking at other user home directories.  I suspect that any user with the ability to unlock the drive and physical access to the machine could boot into single user mode and see the hard drive.\n", "Q: How do I mask \"forbidden\" chars in passwords in the mount command? How do I properly mask/escape illegal characters like /:@\\ in passwords added in the mount command?\nThe question arose in the answer here:\nmount -t afp afp://adminname:password@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine\n\nThe asking person had a backslash \"\\\" in the password and the command didn't work. The solution were single quotes around the afp...-part.  \nTesting the whole scenario in a VM, I created an admin with a password similar to aaaaa\\@11111, but I haven't been able to get the mount command working.\n\nA: Use URL encoding to protect the wonky characters in the password. Essentially each character (or byte of UTF-8) can be encoded as a % followed by two hex digits specifying the encoded byte. In your example, \\ -> %5C and @ -> %40:\nmount -t afp afp://adminname:aaaaa%5C%4011111@ServerIPAddress/ShareName /Volumes/TimeMachine\n\nThis worked in my test.\n", "Q: Recommendations for inter-app audio apps for GarageBand?

I`m exporting a 1 hour slide show from aperture with music.\nI`ve outputted a 720p ipad version (done), now doing a 1080p HD version export.\nIt gets to about 65% (twice) then gives me an error that the disc is full. I had 45 gig left prior to exporting on my laptop retina.\nwhy is aperture filling up my local disc when i`m exporting to a Lacie thunderbolt drive?\nI have zero disc space left, I cannot even perform a screen capture or do rudimentary things on my mac, and I cannot find the video rendered (data exported) so far that has clogged up my system to full... where is it being stored? what do I need to delete to get this space back?\nplease help urgent, i need to get this wedding slideshow out by tonight and move on to other editing tasks.\n\nA: I'm guessing it's using the boot drive [its own Library structure, in fact] as a scratch disk & making the video as raw data, which it will then compress & copy to the desired location. \nYou cannot dictate which drive it will use for scratch, unlike Photoshop, so the only thing I can think to 'fix' it [other than start deleting stuff] would be to move the Aperture Library to a larger drive. Double-clicking the 'new' library will launch Aperture with that as its new default.\nYou could always move it back afterwards.\n", "Q: How does my just-booted and encrypted iPhone still receive messages before I decrypt it with the passcode? It's my understanding that personal data on the iPhone 6 is automatically encrypted with the user's passcode. This is why when you boot it for the first time the passcode is required instead of the fingerprint.\nMy question, however, is why after the first boot, before entering the passcode for the first time, does the iPhone continue to receive account-specific notifications? As an example, Google Hangouts will actively receives messages that are readable and on the lock screen before any decryption has taken place. Wouldn't this imply that the user data for apps somehow are not encrypted?\n\nA: Probably because you didn't just reboot it. All you did was turn on the screen.\nOnce you enter the passcode, some but not all of the data remains accessible until you turn the phone (not just the screen) off. To turn the phone off, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds until a \"Slide to turn off\" slider appears, and slide it.\n", "Q: Notes.app: Notes from iCloud show title but bodies are blank! I have been using notes.app for a while, especially for its ability to use iCloud to sync. Everything has seemed fine, though it seems like some of my older notes' bodies are showing up blank. \nI suspect that this is merely a retrieval/format issue, but I am also concerned that by looking at a note triggers an automatic save, which in turn does in fact replace iCloud's copy of that note with the now-blank version. I have stopped looking at older notes pending a solution in case looking is destructive.\nHow do I download an archive of my iCloud notes that I may preserve and peruse at my leisure?\nNotes have been left from Mavericks, Yosemite, and iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1.2. I am currently retrieving them using Yosemite.\n\nA: Welcome to my world.\nI had same problem and ended up killing the Notes in iCould.\nBefore that I moved my precious notes to \"on my mac\" at least the ones that were still there.\nNo more iCloud stealing my notes.\n", "Q: Rebooting the MBP in recovery mode When I reboot with Control-R pressed as suggested by many, I see the spinning wheel for more than half hour and the laptop does not show the recovery options. I have Yosemite and want to go back to Mavericks for various reasons.

Last year, I switched from an iMac to a MacBook Pro, and I restored from my Time Machine backup. I've been using Time Machine since then, and never checked it until now. I just found out that my backups are split into 2, \"dee's iMac\" and \"dee's MacBook Pro\" when I expect them to be just one backup since I moved everything from my iMac to MBP.\nThe \"dee's iMac\" backups aren't accessible through \"Enter Time Machine\" and aren't deleted when Time Machine is full; instead, it will delete the newer backups from my MBP backups, which currently holds only the past 2 months while there are backups from my iMac from last year. \nIs there any way to merge these backups? What happens if I just move all the contents of the \"dee's iMac\" folder to the \"dee's MacBook Pro\" folder? Or should I just delete the entire \"dee's iMac\" backup folder?\nNote: Currently on OS X Yosemite, 2013 MBP (non-retina)\n\nA: You can still access data from \"dee's backup\" by selecting \"Browse Other Time Machine Disks\" from Time Machine's Dock menu. (Right click or click-and-hold on TM's icon in the Dock.)\nTM is holding onto both sets of data because even though YOU know you copied all the data from the old machine to the new, all TM knows is that a bunch of data just showed up on the new machine. It doesn't know where that data came from, but knows it should be backed up.\nWhen TM, running on \"dee's Macbook Pro\", needs to delete files to make room, it can only delete files backed up from \"dee's Macbook Pro\". Even the root user on that machine has no authority (and cannot give TM authority) do delete some other computer's backup files.\nYou don't need any of \"dee's iMac\" backup. As you say, everything from that computer got copied over, and none of it has been needed since last year. It's time to let it go. To do that, open the Backups.backupdb folder on your backup disk, and delete the subfolder named \"dee's iMac\". (I'm assuming you're backing up to an external disk connected to your MBP. Details will be different if you're backing up to a Time Capsule or a network volume, but the principle is the same.) Time Machine won't let you modify that backup in any way except that it will allow you to delete it in its entirety. You'll need to authenticate as an admin to do that. And it will take a while. You should be able to delete it using Finder, but if not you can enter the Terminal command:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/\"disk name\"/Backups.backupdb/\"dee's iMac\"\n\n\nA: Don’t attempt to merge them. All that will do is corrupt the MBP backup, which is the only one that matters. There’s no use in keeping the old one. It’s just redundant. Think of it as a useless block of data that’s just clogging up disk space.  \nTime machine is only deleting the MBP backups because those are the only backups it recognizes as Time Machine backups - those associated with the external drive. The old iMac \"TM backups\" aren’t recognized as such, so they are just treated as any other data on the backup drive would be treated by Time Machine (not touched). You'd need to delete the iMac TM backup because there’s no use for it and it’s taking up unnecessary space (which, by extension, will cause the MBP backups to be automatically deleted more quickly). \nIs all your data accounted for currently? If so, I’d recommend starting fresh. Reformat the external hard drive. It will be recognized as a new drive by TM. Then, have Time Machine make a new, full backup of your machine in its present state and proceed unimpeded from there (into the future). \n", "Q: iPhone 5s screen goes black during a phone call When I end a phone call I find that the screen has gone black. I have to turn it on and re-enter my password to hang up. Is there a way to keep the phone from turning black during a call? The call is not affected.\n\nA: Is your phone in a protective case?  My wife's iPhone does the same thing because her case is loose and slides over the proximity sensor and thinks it's still by her face.  \nThe screen turns black because of a proximity sensor on the phone. This is to save battery during a call, and to protect the buttons from being pressed when it's up against your face. This feature can not be disabled. The only way I have been able to prevent the screen from turning black during a call is by using a Bluetooth headset, earbuds, or speakerphone during the call, and never bringing it close enough to the face to trigger the sensor. \n\nA: Have you tried a hard reset or restored to factory settings? That your screen goes black when you hold it against your ear is normal. But it should turn on again when you remove it from your ear.\n", "Q: Apps are not opening in Mac Google Chrome and other apps are not opening, they just bounce and then stop without giving me any error message.\nI also re-downloaded Google Chrome and still not opening.\nRecently I installed windows 8 via bootcamp and I had to delete lots of useless files I maybe deleted an important file by accident.\nHere is a screenshot of the files that won't get deleted from my trash.(possibly important)\n \nPlease help me with this problem.

Mostly I'm getting used to and liking it... except for the fact that without a menu bar I can't check the time at a glance.\nWhat are some easy ways to display the current time on Yosemite without using the mouse/trackpad?\n\nA: You can move focus to menu bar with for example: ⌃ CTRL+F2 or ⌘ CMD+⇧ SHIFT+/.\nAlternatively You can show Dashboard with clock as a widget (but set the Dashboard not as a separate space).\n", "Q: Will I be able to receive my WhatsApp chat history when i change my phone I have been using a sim for two months on my iPhone and now I gave that sim to my cousin. What I am worried about is will she recieve my WhatsApp chat history when she downloads WhatsApp to her phone.\n\nA: WhatsApp works on the phone number, not the phone, so you need to transfer your number\nFrom the WhatsApp FAQ\n\nBefore you stop using a particular phone number or phone, you should migrate your WhatsApp account to the new number or new phone.\nFor a simple way to delete your old account number and migrate your data to a new number, use our Change Number feature.\n\n", "Q: Annoying shrill outgoing Facetime ring tone Is there anyway to stop the FaceTime ringtone heard on an outgoing call? I have tried the iPhone mute button and FaceTime mute icon with no success. \n\nA: No, this is not possible without switching output device to another connected device which is muted, such as a bluetooth speaker or car stereo, or jailbreaking to delete the audio file from the filesystem.\n\nA: You can't actually mute it but you can reduce to a very low level, simply with the volume buttons. It will remember your settings for future calls.\n\nA: Use earphones whilst it's calling and when it's connecting take them out.\n", "Q: Mac OS 10.7.5 – VLC - Can't find AB Loop Hotkey in Preferences I use VLC as a video player for many reasons but mainly in order to benefit from the A-B Loop function where I can select a particular section of the video and watch it over and over again at different speeds. VLC for Mac OS does not allow users to add a loop button on the controller bar at the bottom of the window such as VLC for Windows. \nThe only option is to define the A & B points by clicking on the Playback menu item and scrolling down to A→B Loop to define point A, then do the same again to define point B, which render the function useless and overly convoluted, or at the least inaccurate and completely frustrating. The other option is to use the shortcut (hotkey combination) shift+command+L, which works somewhat better, but still is very annoying when trying to define specific points on the video where you want to the loop to start and end. \nI tried to use change the Hotkey combination in Preferences under Hotkeys, but to my dismay, the A→B Loop is not listed anywhere in the list of functions under Hotkeys. How come? All other functions are!\nI was hoping someone could give me some advice on how to make this function easier to use and/or how to maybe customize the A-B Loop Hotkey so I may choose a single key on the keyboard instead of a 3-key combination.\nI would love to see in the future a visual indicator on the screen where users can visually define the A & B point on the slider. I'd hate to switch to a different video player because I love VLC otherwise, but if I don't find a solution for this particular issue, I might just have to.\nCheers!\n\nA: System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.\nHit +  add VLC & set up as a Menu Command \n[if you can't find the → character just copy/paste this… A→B Loop]\nAdd any hotkey you like - beware of duplicates, of course - the new hotkey will then show in VLC's menu as though it were native.\nI don't know how A→B Loop behaves on the PC, but on Mac it's simply one tap to set the 'in' point A, second tap sets the 'out' point B & automatically starts the loop. 3rd tap clears the loop points & playback continues.\n\n", "Q: Error when terminal opens; no available formula When I open my terminal I see the following message\nLast login: Thu Dec 18 22:00:53 on ttys000\nError: No available formula for php5\n\nI have tried to run brew doctor but the error remains.

I would like to retrieve all the Reminders in a specific reminders list with Automator. Searching for reminder, the available actions are “Delete Reminders”, “New Reminders Items”, “Filter Calendar Items“ and “Find Calendar Items”. \nFind Calendar Items allows you to search for reminders, but the search parameters available are \n\n\n*\n\n*Title\n\n*Notes\n\n*Priority\n\n*Completed\n\n*URL\n\n*Date Due\n\n*Date last modified\n\n*Date completed\n\n*Reminder has (alarms)\n\n*Reminder has no (alarms)\n\n\nThe “Reminder has (no)” query is fixed on alarms, no other options are given.\nIs there any way to get all the Reminders from a given list?\nI’m running Yosemite and Automator 2.5.\n\nA: I have found a workaround. In that list, let’s call it Downloads, I have put the word “downloads” in every reminder item. Like so:\nDownloads\n\n\n*\n\n*Download http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/24/#javascript-automation\n\n*Download https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/\nRedundant and not too pretty, but it works.\nThe way I accomplished this was the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Calendar Items\n\n*\n\n*Find Reminders where\n\n*All of the following are true\n\n*Any content contains list_name\n\n\n*Event Summary\n\n*…Now you can run other actions like “Extract URLs from Text“\n\n\nThen you’re done.\n\nOne thing I have learned is that (so far) there is no way to retrieve the contents of a list from Reminders. These actions will grab any item that has the text of the list name. It won’t grab that list (or all the contents) even though the list has the stirng I am searching for. It makes sense but it is lacking a bit. \n\nA: To show a specific reminder list in the app you can use JXA. \nvar Reminders = Application(\"Reminders\")\nReminders.activate()\nReminders.lists.byName('List 1').show()\n\n\nIf you want to get the text of all reminders in a list you can use \nApplication('Reminders').lists.byName('List 1').reminders.whose({completed: false}).name()\n\nTo pull information out I used https://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/08/my-jxa-problem/\notherwise you can find more JXA snippets https://github.com/SeamlessIO/JXA-Snippets\n", "Q: Reset or Uninstall Yosemite Server I installed Yosemite Server and I had previously configured the Apache for web development. Now, It seems that the configuration and everything is messed up.\nHow can I reset my web server configuration to factory settings, like after installing a fresh Yosemite?\nDoes an uninstall of Yosemite Server affects my current web server configuration?\n\nA: You can reset just the Websites service in OS X Server with the following command:\nsudo serveradmin command web:command=restoreFactorySettings\n\nMake sure the Websites and Wiki services are off when you run this command.\nUninstalling OS X Server will, by default, retain all configuration files so that reinstallation keeps all data, however you can delete the Server folder to reset all the data.\n", "Q: Deleting content of /private/tmp moved on different HDD I have a Macbook pro with 2 internal HD (stock HD for data and data doubler + SSD in place of the optical drive, hosting the OS).  I'm now trying to optimize this setup to take into account the presence of the SSD, and I want to move the temporary folder from the SSD (/private/tmp) to the secondary drive (/Volume/MacintoshHD/private/tmp).\nFollowing this (http://blog.alutam.com/2012/04/01/optimizing-macos-x-lion-for-ssd/comment-page-1/#ramdisk), here's what I did :\nsudo ditto /private/tmp /Volumes/MacintoshHD/private/tmp\nsudo rm -rf /private/tmp\nsudo ln -s /Volumes/MacintoshHD/private/tmp /private/tmp\n\nEverything is fine, but when I reboot, I expect the folder to be emptied as usual.  However, I found out that whatever files that were present on the previous OS execution are still present.\nMy guess is that whatever script emptying the /private/tmp folder executes before the magnetic HD gets mounted, which means that the link pointing to the tmp folder does not point anywhere then, and hence the failed deletion.\nAny idea how to fix this?  Any other suggestion to move the /private/tmp folder to another drive and still preserve automatic deletion?\n\nA: After doing some research, I ended up writing a shell script and using launchd to have it execute at boot time.\nThe script I use (/usr/local/bin/empty-tmp.sh) :\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Delete files (other than directories) that haven't been modified in more than 1 day\nfind /Volumes/MacintosHD/private/tmp -not -type d -ctime +1d -delete\n\n# Delete empty directores that have been created more than 1 day ago\nfind /Volumes/MacintoshHD/private/tmp -d -type d -empty -mindepth 1 -Btime +1d -delete\n\nand the property list (in /Library/LaunchDeamons) :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.samric.emptytmp</string>\n\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/bin/bash</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>/bin/wait4path /Volumes/MacintoshHD/private/tmp/ && /usr/local/bin/empty-tmp.sh</string>\n  </array>\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>LaunchOnlyOnce</key>\n  <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nNow the key is using wait4path to make sure the secondary HD (MacintoshHD) is properly mounted before invoking the script.

I have an old e-mail address linked to my Mac Mail account.  I have made a rule that forwards new mail from a specified address - call it johndoe@test.com - between my old e-mail and my current e-mail.  Right now, I need to manually open the Mail application for the rule to apply to new mail.  \nI'd like to do this automatically, without needing to manually open and close Mac Mail.  To avoid opening it manually, I created an Automator program that performs the following actions on a daily basis:\n\nWhile this Automator Application opens and quits Mac Mail, it doesn't seem to work, as my current address doesn't receive any forwarded e-mails.  Is there another way to automatically forward e-mails from johndoe@test.com from my old e-mail address (linked to Mac Mail) to my new one?\n\nA: Where is your new email service? Perhaps you can configure it to check your AOL mailbox and pull it down.  This would happen automatically on their servers and wouldn't require a script on your side.\nFor example, if your new email service was with Gmail, go into the Settings>Accounts tab and add your AOL account to the \"Check mail from other accounts\" section.\n", "Q: Can't play albums in iTunes I know you've been dealing with this for two years.  However, none of the recommended solutions works for me.  iTunes will play one song, and stop.  Or, it will play one song - over and over and over.  I am using iTunes vsn. 12.0.1, updated on 10/21/14, on a Mac running OS 10.7.5.\n\nA: This is often caused by iTunes' insistence on only playing songs that are 'checked', even though you can't tell whether they're checked or not except in Songs view. \nIf you don't need the functionality that checking songs is used for (syncing with other devices, or limiting what appears in smart playlists), you can turn it off by unchecking Preferences > General > Show List Checkboxes. Then iTunes will play any selection you like without stopping.\nIf you don't want to disable checkboxes, as @Buscar웃 says, the Up Next list is your (somewhat unintuitive) friend.\n\nA: Not sure if it is the 10.7.5 but on 10.9.5 it works just fine with iTunes v.12.0.1.  \nSelect/Open a album click to play first or any song in it, select shuffle if you want to and it plays all songs in that album.\nWhile showing what is up Next:\n\nTo make sure it only plays a single album select all songs in that album and hit play.

It simply does nothing.\nI haven't changed my HyperSwitch's preferences and I don't remember installing or updating anything that would create a conflict.\nHowever cmd+tab window preview is working, so the app is clearly up and running.\nIs anyone experiencing the same problem? Or everything works well?\nI have already contacted the creator of the app to get some support.\nMeanwhile, is there any free app with the same Alt+Tab window scrolling feature?\n\nA: I found the real answer to this question in reading this and this. What happens is your mac gets stuck in \"SecureInput\" mode. When this happens, HyperSwitch won't work, and I also noticed keyboard events won't be picked up by Karabiner-EventViewer. If you use iTerm2, you may notice that in the iTerm2 -> Secure Keyboard Entry is stuck on, and you can't toggle it. This has nothing to do with iTerm2; some other process is hanging on to SecureInput and iTerm2 is simply reflecting that state.\nFind the offending process. Run\nioreg -l -w 0 | grep SecureInput\n\nand hunt for a PID. In my case, I found \"kCGSSessionSecureInputPID\"=102 so I killed it with sudo kill 102. 102 was loginwindow so this logged me out, but I was able to log back in and most of my processes could be resumed. However, maybe some other app is hanging onto \"SecureInput\" so killing it won't be as drastic. After, HyperSwitch worked again, and keyboard events were also showing in Karabiner-EventViewer.\n\nA: I thought HyperSwitch had broken until I realised that I was using the wrong buttons to switch between apps. HyperSwitch defaults to using Option + Tab, but I was using Command + `Tab.\nAfter changing the command options in the preference menu and restarting HyperSwitch everything started working for me. This following image may provide clarification.\n\n\nA: After months of digging I found out what was my problem. As I visited this page like a million times I'll leave here my story as it may be helpful\nMy issue was related to the new \"Secure Input\" feature of os x. When Secure Input is enabled, apps like HyperSwitch, Contexts etc... will not be able to grap hotkeys.\nSome app may be bugged and not release the secure input lock, or (like in my case) you may have some issue with Iterm2. In this case just disable it, Iterm2 menu -> Secure Keyboard Entry and you have your life back!\n\nA: No idea what feature you are looking for as I've never used HyperSwitch and their website doesn't show much.\nFor a \"better than Apple's\" Application Switcher, I use LiteSwitch X.\nIf you want one that switches between windows instead of full Applications, try Witch\n\nA: For anybody who comes here for the same question but still not yet solves it.\nI encountered the same question and just solved it not by all of the ways listed above.\nHere are the procedures of how I solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall the HyperSwith app.\n\n*use the cmd sudo find /Users -name \"*HyperSwitch*\" to find out all of the cache files and configuration files of HyperSwith and then, remove them all by the cmd rm -rf files.\n\n*restart your computer.\n\n*reinstall HyperSwith.\n\n\nA: lock your mac, then unlock, you'll found that it works\n\nA: Thanks to the answer from Enrico Carlesso I managed to figure out a way to fix this issue without signing out.\nIn my case it was iTerm2 that created the problem, and you can solve it without restarting iTerm2.\nFix:\n\n*\n\n*Select the iTerm menu item, select Secure Keyboard Entry so that it is selected (checked)\n\n*Write sudo ls in a terminal window. Write your password and press enter.\n\n*Select the iTerm menu item again, make sure Secure Keyboard Entry is deselected / unchecked.\n\nNow Hyperswitch worked for me again.\n", "Q: iPhone available space: significant difference between iTunes and iPhone I am trying to update my wife's iPhone from iOS 7 (.x.x) to 8 (the latest). I was trying through iTunes because the iPhone says only around 300MB is available. iTunes shows around 7GB as available space. But when I hit update, it complains that at least 770MB should be available and it is not.\nIs this a known issue that iTunes reports a larger available space than iOS? I have read about the \"Other\" storage space problem, but this is about \"Free\" space.\nAlso, is there a workaround to reclaim this \"free\" space?\nThis is a iPhone 5S, latest iTunes (12.0.1.26) on OSX Yosemite (10.10.1)\niPhone:  \n\niTunes:  \n\n\nA: I had the same problem too. My iPhone 6 showed free memory at less than 200mb and iTunes showed more than 5.6GB.\nTo correct this problem: go to your device (iPhone) and go to settings, iTunes & App Store, click on your Apple ID and select Sign Out. Go back and Sign in again. This is a lot simpler than restoring your backup.\n\nA: Are you using iTunes Match? If so, turn it off.  Any locally cached files will be purged.  iTunes doesn't see the Match downloaded music but only what it is configured to sync.  I think this is why you see usage difference between the phone and iTunes.\n\nA: To clear out 'ghost' space from iOS devices, first backup your device to iCloud [Fully] then wipe the device & restore from your most recent backup.\niCloud does not backup any of the 'ghost' space & therefore does not restore it either.\n\nA: You might want to try out the third-party Mac application PhoneExpander. This can clear the cache of your iPhone and free up some space.\n\nA: This may have happened if you recently deleted a bunch of photos from your phone. Oftentimes, when you delete a large amount of pictures from the Photos app, the amount of actual free space does not show up, and it shows a smaller amount of space available than you actually have. Maybe, if you haven't tried this yet, you could 'hard reboot/reset' your phone. This won't delete anything. To hard reboot, you need to hold down the power button and home button until the phone turns off and then shows the apple logo. If this doesn't work, there is a great Mac application called PhoneClean that deletes a bunch of cache files and the likes from your phone, freeing up a lot of space. On my first time, I got as much as 700mb of free space on my 16gb iPad from this application, so give it a try.\n\nA: Join Apple beta and you can get cuter iOS updates and have a decketed out phone without jailbreak and it will work also \n\nA: A simple solution: sign out from icloud, then sign in, all the \"ghost\" memory space will be back. \n", "Q: Why does my mac keep crashing under panic

I've made many small tweaks and preference customization to the Mavericks install on my Mac. If I upgrade to Yosemite, will those tweaks and preferences be reset and would require me to re-apply them?\n\nA: In general, no. Most of your settings will remain intact, but some of them may be reset or irrelevant in Yosemite. \n\nA: I upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite several months ago, and didn't notice any differences with OS preferences.  They should stay the same. However some application specific preferences may change, but I would guess that for most standard apps, like Mail, your preferences would remain intact.  But it would help if you were more specific about what kind of preferences.  \n", "Q: Arbitrary Editor for Mac I need a text editor on mac that could open arbitrary file and show its content. \nEdit: I dont want to \"decode\" the files, I just want to read them byte by byte, as they are sitting on the filesystem, just like fopen() in c. (No parsing!) Is there any editor that can do that?\nFor example, I want to open \"test.pages\" file, because I am curious. Textedit denied to open it, textWrangler opened it in disk browser. TextMate did open it , showing first 2 characters as PK, (which i understand as a packed file), but it showed lots of special characters as white spaces, which is not acceptable.\nNotepad (or any XYZ editor on windows) could open arbitrary files, without ever complaining about \"format\".\n\nA: This seems to be the job for a hex viewer/editor rather than a text editor. An easy way to do this would be just to use Terminal emacs with hex mode.\nIf you prefer a GUI application Hex Fiend looks promising\n\n  \n*\n  \n*A fast and clever open source hex editor for Mac OS X.\n  \n*Insert, delete, rearrange.  Hex Fiend does not limit you to in-place changes like some hex editors.\n  \n*Work with huge files.  Hex Fiend can handle as big a file as you’re able to create.  It’s been tested on files as large as 118 GB.\n  \n*Small footprint.  Hex Fiend does not keep your files in memory.  You won’t dread launching or working with Hex Fiend even on low-RAM machines.\n  \n*Binary diff.  Hex Fiend can show the differences between files, taking into account insertions or deletions.\n  \n*Data inspector.  Interpret data as integer or floating point, signed or unsigned, big or little endian...\n  \n\n\nA: You can open Terminal.app and have a go with nano or vim if you want. When I opened a .pages file with TextWrangler, it opened it up the archived file tree (giving access to all of the files therein). It then showed special sub-files byte-for-byte (for example the PDF preview).\nAll I did was right-click on the .pages file and Open With… TextWrangler. You may have to change the selection box to \"All Applications\" instead of \"Recommended Applications.\"\n", "Q: Is there a video app which can position subtitles over black bars? I've been happily using VLC for all video playback but now realised it's missing a feature I think is quite essential – having subtitles placed on the black bar below a movie instead of in the actual picture where it wastes screen real estate and annoys. VLC has a 'Force subtitle position' option which does not do anything useful with negative values. MPlayerX allows adjusting the position relative to the bottom, again, no use for negative values.\nCan anyone suggest a player that can do this?\n\nA: I found this - Subtitler Lite VLC plugin,\nwhich might possibly do what you need.\nI haven't tested it myself yet, so feel free to add comments re success or otherwise.\n", "Q: IPhone 4 Transfering Pictures I am upgrading my phone from the 4 to the 6 and trying to back up all photos and videos and everytime I move a photo from the Camera Roll to the Photo Stream to upload to the Cloud and the erase from the Roll it also erases the same picture from the photo stream.\nIt defeats the whole purpose...Help !\n\nA: When, upgrading, I always just backup my old iPhone to iTunes and restore the iTunes backup.  That gets all pics including the camera roll. \nI just recently upgraded from a 5s to 6, and I still have the very first pic I took with an iPhone on July 11, 2008 and that is how I've always done it.  \nNote: backup in iTunes is not the same as syncing with iTunes.  Click the phone icon to find the backup button.\n", "Q: Change home directory with symlink I added an SSD to my system, so now I have a boot drive on the SSD and my home directory on a different volume. I successfully changed the home directory as specified in Change Users Home Directory. However, this breaks all of the symlinks I've set up for my dotfiles, since things like .bashrc which used to point to /Users/me/.local/dotfiles/.bashrc are now broken.\nMy fix was to instead change /Users/me/ to be a symlink to /Volumes/Home/Users/me, and set /Users/me to be my home directory. Are there any stability problems with this approach? Will it be noticeably slower than having my home directory actually be /Volumes/Home/Users/me?\n\nA: This approach is quite okay and generally sane. You should verify that Time Machine is still backing up your home directory, following the symlink to the new drive, and not just backing up a reference to your directory.\n", "Q: How to view current display resolution How can I find out the current resolution the screen is running at, in OS X 10.10?\nUnder settings -> display (which is where I think it used to be), it shows the refresh frequency, but not the resolution.  Using the monitor's controls, I can see it's running at 3840x2160, but how would one find this out from OS X?\n\nA: system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType will give you the physical resolution of a Retina display, but it won't give you the effective (scaled) resolution. If you need that, you can sort of get it with osascript:\n$ osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to get bounds of window of desktop'\n0, 0, 2048, 1280\n\nNote that if you're running a multi-monitor setup, this may require some interpretation. For instance, I have a Retina iMac 21\" with physical resolution 4096x2304 and scaled resolution 2560x1440; I also have an external portrait monitor running at 1440x2560:\n┌─────────┐┌─────────────┐\n│  1440x  ││  2560x1440  │\n│  2560   ││             │\n│         ││             │\n│         │└─────────────┘\n│         │\n└─────────┘\n\nWhen I run the command above, it reports:\n-1440, 0, 2560, 2560\n\nThese are the bounds of the desktop relative to the upper left corner of the main monitor:\nx = -1440       0          2560\n     ┌─────────┐┌─────────────┐ y = 0\n     │         ││             │ \n     │ Monitor ││  Monitor 0  │\n     │    1    ││             │\n     │         │└─────────────┘ 1440\n     │         │\n     └─────────┘                2560\n\nAs you can see, this by itself doesn't actually give you the scaled vertical resolution of the main monitor (although you can figure it out from the physical aspect ratio).\nAnother option is the GPL'ed utility screenresolution (which is available through Homebrew if you don't want to build it yourself). The command line isn't much like anything else on this earth, but it works:\n$ screenresolution get\n2018-04-20 10:00:14.935 screenresolution[12084:518367] starting screenresolution argv=screenresolution get \n2018-04-20 10:00:14.938 screenresolution[12084:518367] Display 0: 2560x1440x32@0\n2018-04-20 10:00:14.939 screenresolution[12084:518367] Display 1: 1440x2560x32@60\n\nAs a bonus, it also gives you the color depth in bits and, if available, the refresh rate in Hz.\n\nA: You go to apple menu -> about this mac, and there is a Displays tab with the information.\n\n\nA: You can get the resolution in Terminal using system_profiler by issuing the following command:\nsystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | awk '/Resolution/{print $2, $3, $4}'\n\n\nA: You can see the current resolution in the Display system preferences.\nOn a Macbook .. Retina, If you have scaled selected for resolution\nHover your mouse over the current scaled selection and the resolution will be shown.\nIf you have  default selected for resolution then the resolution is not shown.\n\n( I cannot check my non retina desktop at the moment)\nBut either way you could run this Applescript/Objective - C script from your Applescript Menu or from Script Editor.\n    use framework \"CoreGraphics\"\n    use scripting additions\n\n    set sizes to item 1 of (current application's NSScreen's mainScreen's frame as list)\n\n    set theRez to (\"width:\" & width of |size| of sizes & \" x height:\" & height of |size| of sizes) as string\n\n\ndisplay dialog theRez with title \"Main Screen Rez\" buttons \"OK\"\n\n\n\nA: You could parse the output of displayplacer if needed for scripting.

But since this new Safari came with Yosemite, the tabs maintain their own sessions. \nIs there any way I can keep the login session between safari private tabs till the private window closes, just like how Google Chrome does?\n\nA: No, this is currently not possible. Safari Private Browsing tabs and windows do not share any session data and are completely independent.\nFrom the Apple Support KB \"Safari for Mac: Use Private Browsing windows in Safari\":  \n\n\n*\n\n*Each tab in the window is isolated from the others, so websites you view in one tab can’t track your browsing in other tabs.\n\n", "Q: Safari CMD+Click link new tab focus Is there a way to force focus to a new tab in safari when you cmd+click on links in google search results for example? \n\nA: Go to Preferences → Tabs and enable When a new tab or window opens, make it active.\n\nEnabling this option switches the shift modifier to disabling this functionality rather than enabling it.\n\nA: Command-Shift-click takes you to the newly-opened tab.\n", "Q: Mac Messages sending to Wrong Computer I recently purchased a new MBP to replace an older one.

By default, the icons/image previews are not large enough for my needs, so I increase the size of the thumbnail icons in the bottom right of the finder window to determine which image to use. Easy peasy.\nWhen I do this, however, the icons don't cascade down. Instead, I get a scrollbar with icons out of view to the right. This is so Windows 2000. \nMy solution is to go to View > Clean Up By > Name and all icons are shown with only up and down scrolling and are the size I want.\nIs there some way I can have it so when I increase icon preview size in the Finder, that all images stay inline? \nI don't need to set a default size for all icons to load. I prefer the default size for most use cases, aside from this one. \nSee below for an example showing my workflow issue.\ntl;dr I want responsive design applied to my finder icons!\n\n\nA: You can have the folder contents auto-arranged in icon view via a few settings in View > Show View Options (⌘ Cmd-J).\nWhen you select the files to be Arranged By the criteria you prefer and select Use as Defaults, the icons are automatically re-organised on-the-fly. Note that you don't need to select Always open in icon view, as in the example image below.\nThese default settings will be used for all folder that don't have folder-specific settings applied, before or after setting the defaults.\nYou have to restart Finder, e.g. by killall Finder before the new defaults are used.\n\n(Image borrowed from a SuperUser answer)\n", "Q: How do I sign out of iCloud on iOS6 How do I sign out of iCloud on iOS6.\nI have created a 2nd AppleID I want to use for iCloud synching, but the only option I get is \"Delete Account\".

Now he has given it to me. I have tried my hardest to find at least a number to call but nothing.\nAny suggestions how to get the phone unlocked or extract the owner's phone number?\n\nA: Though this is in effect a duplicate of How can I bypass Activation Lock? as it's a nice clean question, looking for a legitimate solution - to which only the police or perhaps network provider might be able to assist.\nIt does, however give an opportunity for a lesson in \"be prepared\".\nIn this circumstance, or indeed if you were in an accident - if the authorities can't get in your phone they may not even know who you are..\nSolution - 5 minutes in Photoshop or Gimp…   \nPut your ICE on your lock screen.\n\nThe picture needs to be 200px larger than your screen resolution in both directions, because of the parallax/motion effect, & it might need a couple of attempts to get the text out of the way of the Slide to Unlock, but it's well worth it for peace of mind.\n", "Q: How to add icons to the Opera browser's toolbar? I'm a longtime Opera user, and, now that I'm moving to Mac, I want to install Opera on it.  On Windows and Linux, I can add icons to the toolbar - such as turn images on/off, control the zoom, wrap the text. Yet, on Mac, with the latest Opera (26), there doesn't seem to be any way to edit the toolbar.\nHow can I add icons to the toolbar?\n\nA: From Opera Help pages:\nCustomize toolbars\nYou can change the appearance of a toolbar by adding items, changing where or when it displays, changing the style and wrapping, or returning to its defaults. To do this, Ctrl-click the toolbar and select \"Customize\". The toolbar is highlighted by a yellow border and you can start customizing the toolbar in the following ways:\nTo add an item, such as a button or search field, select \"Appearance\" and in the resulting dialog, click \"Buttons\" and drag a new button from the list for any toolbar to the highlighted toolbar.\nTo change where the toolbar displays in the browser, select \"Appearance\" and change the Placement setting.\nTo change the style of the toolbar, for example, to use text rather than buttons or images, select \"Appearance\" and change the Style setting.\nTo change the wrapping of the toolbar, select \"Appearance\" and change the Wrapping setting.\nTo set the toolbar to display only when it is needed, select \"Appearance\" and check \"Show only when needed\". This is especially useful for the navigation bar.\nTo undo any changes you made and reset a toolbar to the default setting, select \"Reset Toolbar to Its Defaults\".\nTo remove an item from a toolbar, select \"Remove from Toolbar\".\nTo change the order in which toolbar buttons or icons appear, drag-and-drop the buttons or icons.\nTo change the size of the buttons on all toolbars, select Tools > Appearance > Skin and in the \"Icon Size\" field, select the percentage to scale the buttons.\n\n", "Q: How can erase my IPhone using its home,power, or volume buttons?

The more memory you have, the more battery life will be reduced as well — this is why Apple has kept the RAM relatively low in its mobile devices other than laptops. I do not believe that the size of the SSD should have a negative impact on battery life. The larger drives are faster and so should overall reduce battery usage, however, if the drive is crammed full this will reduce battery life simply because there is more information which needs to be available to be accessed.\n\nA: The 13 inch MBA gets up to 12 hours with Intel i7 processor.\nThat is actualy more than the 11 inch MBA which gets up to 9 hours.\nMain reason is battery capacity, 38 vs 54 watt hours.\nThe larger SSD and more RAM have negligible power consumption.\nFor example: 4 Gig RAM consumes 4 watt, while 8 Gig Ram consumes 8 watt, but on the other hand the i7 CPU consumes up to 100 watt under heavy load.\nApple specifies 12 hours with i7 on 13 inch MBA.\nSince the CPU and the LCD screen are the 2 larges power consumers it is safe to say that the 13 inch MBA with i7, 8G RAM and 512 G SSD will yield up to 12 hours on single battery charge.\n\nA: Your cofiguration of the macbook air 13\" will not have any effect on your battery.\nSome programs have a higher inpact on your battery, like iMovie, a virtual machine,... Lets say havier programs effect your battery time in a negative way.\n", "Q: Xbox driver for PS4 for mac?

I heard on windows are drivers that trick the computer into thinking that the PS4 input is an xbox input but can't find ANY for apple. Is there a workaround or are there drivers for mac that allow me to do the same?\n\nA: It might be a button mapping issue. I haven't tested it so I'm not sure it answers your question but here's what I stumbled upon today:\n\nI used an app from the Mac App Store called, Joystick Mapper, although other apps are also available. This allows you to manually map each input from the DS4 to keyboard buttons on your Mac, effectively using the keyboard settings in games as your controls. For this example I mapped the inputs from my DS4 to the keyboard settings in Max Payne 3. If you look at the pictures below, you can see how I used the keyboard settings in the game to help me map the controller (click on the pictures to enlarge them). \n\nhttp://www.backwardscompatible.co.uk/using-your-dual-shock-4-controller-on-a-macbook.html\nThe app is here: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/joystick-mapper/id528183797?mt=12\n", "Q: Windows 8.1: how to update Broadcom driver without using external drive I am looking for a way to update a Broadcom driver without using BootCamp or external boot drive.\nI have a Macbook pro mid-2012 (non-retina) and successfully had Windows 8.1 running on it, except it does not detect any ethernet and wifi devices. \nI used Bootcamp through which I believe I got the latest Windows-support drivers and firmwares.\nI do not have access to any external drive to build a boot drive and to any network which I might download softwares directly from a Windows partition. The entry point is the OS X partition.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Download on Mac from http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/downloaddrivers.php\nDepending on write support, copy to Windows partition from Mac or from Mac partition in Windows.\nIf direct install doesn't fix it, try uninstall from Device Manager, reboot & install again - seems to have worked for others.\n", "Q: Thinkpad keyboard & scrolling I have got an Thinkpad external keyboard with my mac. The keyboard has some mouse buttons and trackpoint. The trackpoint mouse function with two mouse button works fine but scrolling with middle button + trackpoint isn't. Is there any chance to configure scrolling with trackpoint? I have Logitech mouse with scroolwheel, that works out of the box. I use Yosemite.\nThanks\n\nA: I do not own this keyboard, so I can only cite others.\nIn this Topic some users talk about their experience. It seems to depend on the exact version of the keyboard, that you are using.\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-Version:\n\nI was able to get the center mouse button scroll to work by installing USB Overdrive. You select \"middle button\" and change it to \"move to scroll\"\n\n\n*Bluetooth-Version:\n\nMy Lenovo Compact Bluetooth wireless keyboard (Part Number# 0B47190) paired via bluetooth with both my MacBooks quickly, and the middle button used with the red trackpoint on the keyboard scrolls in every situation I can think of (web browsing, doc editing, evernote, MSOffice, Keynote, Pages, etc.) without any addition setup or extra programs like UsbOverdrive.  It just works.\n\n", "Q: Can I set the primary Language of OS X by using shell script or AppleScript? My computer is mac mini (late 2012) with Yosemite 10.10.1 installed. The primary language of the system is English, with Chinese being the second language.\nSometimes I need to use the Maps.app, and as a Chinese person, a map with Chinese characters is more comfortable for me to use rather than English. So when I use the Maps.app, I have to temporally switch the primary language into Chinese, and then switch back to English after using the Maps.\nBut, it's really inconvenient to do the switchings all by clicking the Settings icon, clicking the Language item, and dragging the language up and down. \nCan I do these actions by writing scripts, such as AppleScript or shell script?\nThank you very much!\nP.S. I've checked the dictionaries of AppleScript and also the OS X manual pages, but found nothing help. It seems that no such 'language setting command' exists.\n\nA: You don't have to change System language to launch an app in different one. You can do for example this:\n/Applications/Maps.app/Contents/MacOS/Maps -AppleLanguages '(de)'\n\nThis will launch Maps.app with german language set.\n\nHere are the other options: Is it possible to launch a program in a specific language?\n\nA: You could also use Language Switcher (free), an app which allows you to \"use your apps in different languages at the same time\". It will give you a list of apps and let you choose in which language you want it be started. I use it all the time to make english screenshots for Stack Exchange.\n\nA: You don't need to change language. \nYou can simply set it in the App of Maps' Menu: [View]-> [Labels]-> [always Show Labels in English]. Cancel it.\nTry now :)\n", "Q: How to get list of all Wi-Fi networks available in iPhone 5 My laptop is showing 4-5 wifi networks available in my area. But my iPhone is just showing 1-2 wifi networks. Even when I'm trying to add/search manually, then it is showing error couldn't find network. Anyone have any idea why?\n\nA: Download the Airport Utility app from the app store and then in the settings app enable Wi-Fi Scanner.\n\nYou get a searchable list and export capabilities of the results. Once you have a scan, you can post those results in a new thread to ask what to do in your situation once you have concrete data.\n\nA: Your iPhone has a lower-power Wifi adaptor with a smaller antenna than your laptop. The networks it sees are probably the only ones it can connect to.\n\nA: The thing about the iphones is that it can only get wifi a very short radius from the location(about 10 feet). So try moving your phone to a stonger location of your wifi so that you can access it.\n\nA: If it doesn't show up, you might be able to connect to it as a hidden network. It could be that your iPhone is too far away, and discards the network. Whereas, it may be wrong and it does have the network. This way, it connects.\n", "Q: How to know if Apple service staff copied my private data? Tomorrow I will collect my iMac 27 from the service, after they have replaced the screen (due to yellowish smudges). \nTo my surprise,  I was requested to give them my password. I did not expect they may need it, and did not erase my data at home. I have just made a backup to an external drive. Still, all my documents, photos etc are in my iMac (no porn luckily).\nHow to know if Apple service staff copied or looked into my private data? \n\nA: The simple answer is, there is no way to be absolutely certain. Furthermore, you likely signed agreement to the standard AppleCare Repair Terms and Conditions so from a legal standpoint, you have agreed to the AppleCare Repair Service terms and conditions by signing your property and data over to Apple.\nThe more probable answer is that, as Apple employees, they have very likely signed some kind of non-disclosure agreement, prohibiting them from looking any further than to fix the issue, on pain of dismissal or legal proceedings.\nCondensing some of the comments into this answer…\nIt is possible that the entire drive could be cloned, without your knowledge. Physical possession of the drive is one of the easiest ways to access the data on it.\nIf encrypted, that clone would be of little use without the encryption password - not necessarily the same as the login password.\nThis would not show on any kind of key-logging software, as it could be easily done by removing the drive from the machine.\nHowever… The chances of this actually happening to a machine given to Apple for repair are virtually nil.\nIf it was ever documented as having happened, their stock would collapse, along with their credibility.\nThis is not the same kind of breach as a couple of celebrities being phished or socially-engineered for their details, this would be a whole new level of distrust.\nIt is unlikely to happen.\nAny current or former Apple employees would be most welcome to add comment to this.\n", "Q: Iphone 5 Replacement Program I purchased my Iphone 5 in New-York but i live in London, may Apple restrict me from replacing the Power/Sleep button outside of the US?\n\nA: call apple, they tend to do it on a case by case basis for full phone replacements. \nThat being said if it is just the sleep button, in countries like canada you  can just walk into any apple store and they do it for you, maybe try walking into a store, i would be shocked if the recall was not available in canada and not london \n\nA: When I was in California with a defective iPad purchased in London, the San Luis Obispo Apple store swapped it out for a replacement with no problem. It just had the standard warranty, not Applecare. But I seem to recall that they said they couldn't have done the same for an iPhone, because the UK and US models are actually different -- different frequencies. If you're just having the button replaced that shouldn't matter, though.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable Junk Mail filtering in mail.app? I'm using Mail.app to sync three email accounts on my Mac. I find that usually my Junk Email is usually filled with a lot of emails. It is possible to disable this tab entirely ?\n\nA: If you simply want no filtering & wish to sort mail manually you can just disable Junk filtering altogether from Mail Prefs… \n\nNote: That doesn't actually appear to delete the Junk folder - but it does stop it being populated at all.\n", "Q: How can I repair a scratched MacBook Air screen? (A1369) I have a mid-2011 MacBook Air (model A1369), whose screen has attracted some unsightly but superficial scratches. They look like smudges, but I suspect a layer of coating (or similar) has come off.\nMost likely, the scratches stem from frequent transport with the screen pressed to the keyboard.\nThe screen is not protected by a glass layer – I hope it has a removable user-facing plastics film.\nIs there a way to replace the scratched layer of the screen assembly to get rid of the scratches? I feel confident to do repairs myself and have done similar things in the past.\nHere is a sketch of the scratch areas: \n\nThis picture is based on a photo. The scratch shapes are correct, but color and intensity are exaggerated for readability.\n\nA: The protective plastic cover on the screen is bonded to the complete LCD display and not really removeable as a single element. A video on Youtube (\"A1369 13.3\" Macbook Air LCD Screen Repair step by step howto guide\") explains the removal and disassembly of the display and is one hour long. It involves a heat gun and very careful use of special tools:\n \nConclusion: there is no way to remove the single element (scratched screen protector) in a simple procedure. It would be probably easier to replace the complete lid assembly, but this items costs 500 USD / 440 EUR (Summer 2015). This seems excessive for a screen which has \"only\" a few very unattractive scratches.\nMental note for next Mac: always place a protective cloth between keyboard and screen. \n\nA: I had a similar problem, and wanted to share an alternate cheap fix. My 2 year old MBA screen was damaged by unnoticed juice splatter left between the keyboard and screen over night. I noticed a difference in reflectance next day, tried displex screen polish, but the damage became more noticeable! It was my successive applications of polishing chemicals that made the scratches more visible. So I would advise against that. The MBA screen is different and has a sort of film layer that can get peeled off by polishing solutions.\nThe fix that worked for me is to hide it with a screen protector! I had some success with a generic one called \"6 pack anti-glare screen protector\" for about 6 pounds. The acid damage was successfully hidden, even at different viewing angles. The downside is that you have to be really careful in applying the screen protector (my first attempt was a mess due to difficulty in aligning. I gave up, then restarted with fresh one from the remaining 5). My screen was left with small bubbles of trapped dust near the edge, but I settled because it already looked far better.\nIn retrospect, if my MBA had a screen protector to begin with, then I wouldn't have had this problem. But with a brand new screen and lack of skill in applying a protector, the screen would just have annoying little bubbles earlier...\nEDIT:\nI just realized that the screen protector, has a screen protector-protector (no instructions on a generic budget product). Peeling off the glossy plastic top layer reveals the actual matte screen protector. But that lessened the bubbles since most of them were between these two additional plastic layers. There are other types of screen protectors if you want to maintain the glossy mac screen finish, but I'm not sure whether they would be as effective in hiding scratches underneath. My mac screen now looks like a thinkpad's but the scratches are still hidden.\n\nA: With the introduction of the Unibody Macbook there is a glass on the top of the LCD display, so you're able to change only the cover glass. Here you can find a detailed guide.\nTo dismount the screen you can follow this step by step guide.\nBefore doing the glass replacement I suggest to try this homemade fixes.\n\nA: I'd look into used parts, with a P5 pentalobe and a T5 torx screwdrivers you can do that job, it's really easy and it might be not that expensive.\n", "Q: PDF reader that restores last viewed page Is there a (free) PDF reader that could restore last viewed page when opening a PDF in OS X 10.10?\n\nA: Preview can do it. Just be sure that in your Preferences → PDF tab, you have checked the following option: \n\n\nA: And if you have to resave the file (for whatever reasons), use Adobe Reader, which provides the same functionality.\nNote: Preview.app can seriously mess up the internal structure of a PDF, so that it is no longer usable.\n", "Q: Upgrade logic board of Macbook Unibody 4.1 I've recently found a (factory refurbished) logic board from a Macbook Unibody 5.2 (mid-2009; 820-2496-A) and want to replace the logic board of my Macbook Unibody 4.1 (early-2008) with it, so my Macbook can run a newer OS. I've already upgraded my Macbook with a 240GB SSD and 4GB 800MHz RAM.\nComparing pictures of the logic boards it seems like the connectors are the same, as well as everything else, except for the graphics chip (X3100 is my current, while the one on the new logic board is the x64-based GeForce 9400M). So visually it seems like the 5.2 logic board is perfectly compatible with the 4.1 version.\nI'll probably receive the logic board just before Christmas (never know exactly this time of year), so I can try swapping the logic boards. Once I've succeeded (or failed) I will report to you guys here.\nHas anyone tried doing this before? If it works, does my current OS X installation work with the new logic board or do I need to reinstall OS X?\n\nA: I have received my new logic board today and installed it successfully. I also upgraded the Macbook with a 240GB SSD and 4GBs of RAM.\nI only encountered 2 problems which can be worked around easily. The first one was the different SuperDrive connector. I simply didn't connect the SuperDrive, but you can easily order the right SuperDrive, since they're not that expensive. The second and most important problem I encountered was the different layout of the heat sink. This needs replacement as well in order to get it working properly. I'm still waiting for this part to be delivered. For now, my Macbook shuts down after a few minutes, because it gets too hot.\nAfter I've received the right heat sink and installed Yosemite, I'll give you guys another update.\n\nA: I've got it all up and running now!\nI just bent my heat sink a little, so it covered both the processor and graphics chip. This works like a charm! It's just a temporary issue though, since the proper heat sink is on its way.\nYosemite was installed in about 20 mins and runs perfectly. No lags or choppy graphics and due to the SSD it works even faster than OS X Lion on the old logic board.\nSo if you have an old Macbook Unibody A1181 which can't be updated to the latest version of OS X, you can buy a logic board of a newer version of the A1181 along with the right heat sink and (optional) the right SuperDrive and you'll have an up-to-date Macbook for less than €150. I'd recommend upgrading your HDD to a SSD and your RAM to at least 4GB for maximum results!\n", "Q: History of shared web pages in Safari I shared a web page via Safari (8 on Yosemite) once. Now the last recipient shows up in the menu. How can I delete it from there? See picture for how it looks.\n\n\nA: This was a long time ago, but I found out how to delete the recently shared items and haven't answered yet. So here is how it goes:\nDelete the plist file:\nOld: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sharekit.recents.plist\nNew: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.preferences.extensions.ShareMenu.plist\nI forgot when exactly macOS changed the file location, and maybe both file are present after an upgrade.\nYou can use plutil -convert xml1 <filename> to convert the plist into a human-readable XML format if you want to inspect it.\n", "Q: SSD is not recognised with the internal SATA cable (13\" 2010 MBP) It's pretty weird, seeing that HDD's are recognisable, and that SSD works when in an enclosure (Crucial M500).\nI've read somewhere that it could be an issue with the cable, but I bought a replacement cable, and it doesn't recognise the SSD either.\nOne idea that I have might be the issue is that the SSD needs 1.7 A of current, while the HDD I tested it with only 1 A. \n\nA: The actual problem here was that I installed the OS while the SSD was in an external enclosure, not installed in the internal bay. When I wiped the drive, installed it in the bay and then installed the OS from the old HDD, now in an external drive, my problems were solved.\nI also tried another SATA cable before switching the positions, and that didn't help.\n", "Q: automount problems I have a Yosemite Mac Mini with performance problems.

I'll skip some details and jump to the fact that I deleted my latest iCloud backup both from my iPad and my iPhone, as well as my computer running iCloud for Windows. I did it from all 3 just to make sure the backup got deleted (it wasn't initially showing it deleted, so I did it from all 3).\nI then turned off iCloud backup on both devices. Finally, I turned it back on on just my iPhone. Then I let it do a backup. For some reason, the backup size is much larger than it looks like it should be. See screenshot attached. The settings shown there are the same settings that were in place when it did the backup this morning.\nWhy is the backup size so large? It looks like it should only be about 3MB in size, based on what I have checked. Incidentally, 4.6GB is the same size as the backup I said I originally deleted before starting this process.

But today I'm at home and the location is not changing!\n\nIf I click on the i in the upper right corner, I can't change it manually.\n\nDoes somebody know a solution?\n\nA: Open up System Preference, go into the \"Security\" pane, and then, within \"Location services\" check whether the weather widget is allowed to get your current location. \nIf it is currently checked, and your location is still not correct, uncheck and re-check it again. Note that you might need to unlock the preference pane by clicking on the lock icon in the lower left corner first.\n\nA: Go System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy [tab] \nUncheck and recheck 'Weather' and it's back to normal\nSee below img\n\n\nA: I found what may actually cause this problem. The weather widget uses location services to determine your home location. It caches the last location it found. I use my computer over wired LAN at home and location services does not work without WiFi on. So when at home it could never resolve my location and defaulted to the last location which was incorrect.\nTurn on your wifi, and remove the wrong location from your weather widget. It worked for me.\n\nA: Press the i icon in the top right of the screenshot you provided. There you can change the location for weather.\nEdit\nDid a quick search and it seems to be a bug in yosemite. Found a french website with a solution, link . it seems that the location for you weather is stored in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ncplugin.weather. I don't know if this is a temporary fix\n\nA: Go System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy [tab]\nClick the lock on the bottom left of the window and enter your password.\nUncheck 'Enabled Location Services' and press the lock in the bottom left again.\nOnce more, press the lock to unlock, Enable Location Services again and lock again.\nThis solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I did what Lucas said, and at first it didn't work. I tried again an this time after I had unchecked the Weather in the Location Services I: locked the preference pane, went to the notification center clicked the i in the upper right hand side, then removed the incorrect location, finally I unlocked the preferences pane and checked Weather in Location Services.\n\nA: System Preferences>Security & Privacy \nClick Privacy tab\nSelect \"Location Services\"\nUncheck \"Weather\"\nThe incorrect weather location should disappear. Rechecking \"Weather\" should automatically bring up the correct weather location.\n\nA: I had this problem too. I clicked the \"i\" icon on the bottom right of the widget and once it flipped I typed in my zip code (Australian) and it recognised it as a Sydney zip code and allowed me to select the Sydney time zone. This worked a treat! Nothing else seemed to work.\n\nA: If you hover over the Weather widget there is a little 'i'. Click it then re-enter your location.\n\nA: remove from Notification center then add back..\n\nA: Press the \"i\" icon to the right of \"Weather\", then drag the vacation spot down, so it is no longer at the top of the list. Then delete it.\nIf you don't drag it down from the top of the list, it reappears in about ten or fifteen seconds.\n", "Q: iPhoto Library Picker OK I have been upgrading and moving things around between computers for years and in that time I have managed to have a lot of duplicates in the iPhoto Picker:\n\nI have consolidated the libraries down to three but the iPhoto Library Picker (hold OPTION when launching iPhoto) is filled with a bunch of old cruft that I would dearly love to remove. Problem is I can't find where this list is kept.\nIt does not seem to be in any of the iPhoto preferences in my home or system folder nor in Application Support either.\nAny ideas where this data is stored?\n\nA: Locate iPhoto in your Applications folder. Control + Click on the iPhoto application and \"show package contents\". The file you seek is there.\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain, but I suspect this is the relevant file:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iPhoto.plist\n\nLook for the RecentRootDirectories key, and see if the entries it contains line up with what you're seeing in the UI.\n", "Q: How often and for how long does Trim Enabler need to run? As of Yosemite, DIY, or non-Apple installed SSDs have Trim support challenges using applications such as Trim Enabler. Assuming one keeps their TRIM supported SSD in Yosemite, \n\n\n*\n\n*what is a good strategy for using Trim Enabler periodically so there are no issues with kext-signing and potential OS update conflicts while Trim Enabler is disabled? \n\n*Can this be worked around by periodically using Trim Enabler?\n\n*How long should Trim Enabler be run?\n\n*How often? \n\n*If SSD usage, e.g. amount of read/written data is relevant to how long/often Trim Enabler should be run, is there a way to evaluate guidelines on light, moderate, heavy use.\n\n\nAn excellent feature for TE would be a scheduler to run based on need, then toggle TE off and turn kext-signing back on after a scheduled maintenance run. At least until/if Apple ever reopens kext-signing to software and hardware devs. Cheers - \n\nA: What I used to do was enable TRIM, reboot, create and delete an encrypted disk image that almost filled the free space, leave my MBP idling overnight, disable TRIM, and reboot. That restored performance.\nI'm not sure r/w volumes will tell you anything useful. The OS reuses erased blocks and the current controllers garbage collection is supposed to make TRIM largely irrelevant (or at least that's what I read).\nI don't have that machine anymore and it seems like a lot riskier process under 10.10 so I'm not doing anything with TRIM on my Mac Mini w/ a Samsung 840 EVO.\n", "Q: Display playlist by album instead of by song on iPhone I have an iPhone 5S. I want to see my playlist by albums instead of by songs. When I add an album of songs to the playlist, it shows all the songs. I can do it on iTunes on the computer but it doesn't seem to allow you to show playlist by album instead of by song.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't do this on your iPhone, but on a mac when you select the playlist you can go to the top right corner and change it from songs to albums for them to be sorted by album.\n\nA: This option needs to be added on the iPhone. \nI like sorting through the music on my phone in Album view and its a big hassle when I have 800+ single songs in my \"Gym\" Playlist that get lumped in with the full albums I have on the phone.\nThis has led me to make a separate playlist for the full albums...but you can't view them in any other way except as a list of SONGS in the playlist....its like..damn you can't win.\n", "Q: How to use the programming calculator in OS X? I'm trying to make the best out of the programming calculator in OS X, but I don't know these functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*byte flip\n\n*word flip\n\n*X<\n\n*X>>Y\n\n*RoL/RoR (are these just sll/srl?)\n\n\nAlso is it possible to perform a two's complement on a narrower range i.e. 16 bits instead of 64 bits?\n\nA: Flipping\nByte flip and word flip will swap bytes or words.\nTechnically it works like this:\nLet's say we have a two byte value (hexadecimal): 0x3344\nThe number consists of two bytes, the lower one is 0x44, and the higher one is 0x33, so let's put them into two imaginary cells of one byte size:\n[33][44]\n\nNow, flip the cells:\n[44][33]\n\nTherefore byte flipped value will be 0x4433\nSame way with words, considering word consists of two bytes.\nLet's assume we have a two-word value: 0x12345678\nSplit them into two imaginary cells, now containing one word (2 bytes) each:\n[1234][5678]\n\nNow, flip the cells:\n[5678][1234]\n\nTherefore word flipped value will be 0x56781234\nShifting\nShifting shifts values bitwise.\nWhat does it mean?\nLet's take a very simple decimal number: 5\nThen, let's convert it to its binary representation: 101\nThen, let's shift it left by 1:\n[101] << [1010]\n\nWe basically moved the whole binary sequence left one position and filled the empty space with zero.\nNow do the same, but with shifting right:\n[101] >> [010]\n\nour number is 10 now. The lower 1 is lost by shifting right. The zero on the left is just for display and has no value. \n// Technically there's a CPU flag which indicates that the bit was lost, but it is not relevant to the calculator.\nRotating\nRotating works absolutely same as shifting with one exception: bits are never lost.\nSo, we take the same decimal value 5 and its binary representation 101.\nThen we rotate it right within a byte:\n[00000101] ROR [10000010]\n\nAs you can see, the [1] which was lost on the shifting right was carried on the beginning of our byte.\nSame with shifting left, let's perform series of rotations by 1 bit left until we carry one bit:\n[00000101] ROL [00001010]\n[00001010] ROL [00010100]\n[00010100] ROL [00101000]\n[00101000] ROL [01010000]\n[01010000] ROL [10100000]\n[10100000] ROL [01000001]\n\n\nA: *\n\n*byte flip / word flip - not sure about these\n\n*X<<Y / X>>Y - bitshift X to the left/right Y times\n\n*RoL / RoR - Rotate left/right, similar to bitshifing, except the bits wrap around in a circular fashion\n\n\nA: *\n\n*byte flip : when you have two bytes in one number, such as 0x1441, you'll get 0x4114 after you press this operator;\n\n\n*word flip : As I explained above, it swaps two consecutive words' values. Apple programmer calculator assumes a word length is two bytes;\n\n\n*<< : shift 1 bit to the left, the highest digit will be lost and an extra 0 will be added to the lowest;\n\n\n*>> : shift 1 bit to the right, the lowest digit will be lost and an extra 0 will be added to the highest;\n\n\n*x>>y : shift y bits to the right, you can see it as executing >> y times;\n\n\n*x<<y : shift x bits to the left, very similar to x>>y;\n\n\n*RoL : rotate left, that means, the highest digit will come to the highest digit but not be lost, and other digits shift 1 bit to the left;\n\n\n*RoR : rotate right, very similar to RoL. the lowest digit will come to the highest digit.\nHope that will help you.\n", "Q: Standalone Flash player app for swf -files I use nowadays Opera because it just works for these swf -files. \nNo other browser work. \nHowever, the problem with Opera is that it is big. \nIs there any tool by which you can just view SWF -files?\n\nA: Did you already visit Adobe?\nAdobe provides a standalone Flash Player: Flash Player Projector 16.0.\nAdditional also debugger versions are available as well as older versions. \nOriginally it was meant for Flex and Flash developers. \nExample: Starting a flash game\n\n\nA: at\nhttps://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html\nDownload the \"Flash Player projector\"\nat\nhttps://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/32/flashplayer_32_sa.dmg\nThe second link will be updated.

Remember, it’s a firmware function built-in to a drive checking itself. \nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode. Use the repair disk function of Disk Utility to check the boot volume (disk0s2) from your recovery partition. \n\n*Use third party software such as Techtool Pro to scan for bad blocks on your HDD.\n\n\nBest bet: \nHere is your machine. More than likely, it’s a hardware issue. Specifically, either your drive is failing or the PATA cable is failing. The Apple Hardware Test, even if you were to access, does not test your HDD’s integrity. It would test, however, the input cable to the logic board (the PATA cable) - this is a much cheaper fix.  \nBottom line: You can’t troubleshoot a hardware issue. Backup your data while the drive is still alive. Get a definitive diagnosis from Apple free of charge, and proceed from there.

In Safari go to 'Preferences' > 'Advanced' and select \"Include Bonjour\" where you wish to - either in Bookmarks or in your Favorites bar.\n\n\nA: Unless you’re running a firewall behind a NAT router (which serves no point), Bonjour’s enabled and running by default. It’s used to discover and connect to other devices within your local network configuration (think of that W2P button on a router - it’s Apple’s software equivalent). To view Bonjour discoverable devices through Safari, go to:\nSafari > Preferences > Advanced > “Include Bonjour in The Bookmarks Menu.”\nI’ve never set up a WD MyBook “NAS”, but here’s an example of how Bonjour works through Safari.\nThe printer on my local network (S-2) is discoverable:\n\nI’m able to manipulate its settings via my browser:\n\n", "Q: How do I convert from Case-Insensitive to case-sensitive in 10.8 I just got a new (well refurbished) MacBook Pro running 10.8.3. I am a programmer, so I have need of a case-sensitive filesystem.

I would just need a way to do it without a disk.\nSo, what is the quickest and easiest way to make the partition case-sensitive?\n\nA: I've run in to this before and the only solution I'm aware of is to reformat your file system. Here's what I suggest you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot off of your OSX install media and use Disk Utility to clone your OS image on to another drive.\n\n*Reformat your main drive with the file system you want\n\n*Restore the contents of your backed-up system to the main drive.\nYou could also go largely through Time Machine for this, but I'd recommend going straight at Disk Utility.

I'm using OS X Yosemite and in Pages table jumps to the next page (and leaving text on the first page) when it gets too big, how can I stop it?\n\nA: A table in Pages inherits its page break settings from the line on which it is located. (You can imagine the table is a huge character on a line).\nTo change the behavior of that line place the cursor at the end of the line above the table and press arrow right, moving the cursor to the table row.

Package should install in /Applications location, so that non-admin user can use the app.\nI check this and this\n\nA: The installer is actually doing the right thing by asking for an admin password. Users without admin rights do not have the ability to write to the /Applications directory on a Mac.\nWithout knowing more about your installer, I suspect the request for an admin password is coming from Apple's Installer.app, which is the application that your installer is working with to install your application. \nInstaller.app is detecting that the non-admin account that's running the installation doesn't have admin rights and that /Applications doesn't allow non-admin users to write to it. To resolve the issue, Installer.app is requesting that an admin account authenticate the installation and authorize the needed rights. Otherwise, the installation will just fail.\n\nA: I think somewhere In your package you hav checked require admin authentication.\nI have tested on 10.9 its not asking for password.\n", "Q: How to change language of facebook interface in ipad2 I have ipad , I want to change language of facebook interface to Arabic \nI tried to change (Settings >> General >> Language & region >> Region) to Iraq and now its Iraq , then I uninstall facebook application and re-install again but interface still in English.\n\nA: If you look at the page for that app in the App Store and you will see that Arabic is not on the list of supported languages.

Is the location of these ~/Library/Mail or somewhere else?  I use OS X 10.10.1.  For my IMAP account with domain mykolab.com, the relevant folder seems to be ~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-@mykolab.com@imap.mykolab.com and the inbox is INBOX.mbox, but I can't see the matching location of an email in the client in this folder - there is no option to do so from Mail, and the timestamps for the message files in INBOX.mbox seem to be older than current messages.\nIs there a way to pinpoint the exact file location of an email in the client?\nIf I delete an email and empty trash in the client then is the deletion done securely, using srm or in a non-secure way?\n\nA: I take it the core of your question is how to securely delete an email which you received via an IMAP email account, and read using your local Mac OS X ''Mail'' application.  You ask other interesting questions along the way, to which I'll give only brief answers. \nFirst, it's important to understand the IMAP account, and how it affects deleting messages. The essence of the IMAP approach to email is that mail resides primarily on the mail server. The email client (the Mac OS Mail application in your case) temporarily downloads a copy of the message to your local Mac for you to read. If you were then to feed your Mac to a gigantic crushing machine, the local Mac and its copy of the message would be destroyed, but the original copy of the message remains intact on the IMAP server. When you tell Mail to delete the message, Mail tells the IMAP server to delete its copy of the message, and Mail deletes its own copy of the message. Thus, you might want to concern yourself with how securely the IMAP server deletes its copy.\nSecond, concerning strictly the way Mail deletes its messages, we can tell that the local copy of the message exists as a file on the local Mac. Telling Mail to delete the message makes it disappear from the Mail window, but might not delete the local file containing the local copy. The Mail command \"Erase deleted items...\" does reliably delete the local file with the local copy. \nYou ask, \"If I delete an email and empty trash in the client then is the deletion done securely, using srm or in a non-secure way?\" I don't have access to the Mail source code, so I don't know how securely it deletes the file. We have to assume that it deletes files using the most fast, easy, and insecure method available from Mac OS.\nSo, the most secure way I know of to delete the email message from the client is:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mail, delete the message\n\n*In Mail, erase deleted items. Control-click on the mailbox which had contained the message. A pop-up menu appears. Select \"Erase deleted items...\". A confirmation dialog appears. You are about to delete files related to not just the message you just deleted, but other deleted messages also. Click \"OK\".\n\n*Using Disk Utility, erase free space with either 7 passes or 35 passes. This too will erase more than just the local copy message you deleted.\n\n\nIf you care this much about security, you should also think hard about how your IMAP server deletes messages, and how vulnerable you are to an attacker seeing a copy of the message on your IMAP server's disk. You should also think about whether you should be sending such messages unencrypted, where an attacker monitoring the data flowing through the public Internet could read it.\nYou ask, \"Is there a way to pinpoint the exact file location of an email in the client?\" Yes, but it's not fast and not programmatic. You already figured out that the messages are stored in \n~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-@mykolab.com@imap.mykolab.com/INBOX.mbox/...\n\nMy impression from looking at my own file system and thinking logically is that the local copy of your email message will be one of the files matching:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-@mykolab.com@imap.mykolab.com/INBOX.mbox/*/Data/*/*/Messages/*.emlx\n\n(This pattern is not the only one Mail appears to use; messages stored \"on my Mac\", and attachments, will have different patterns describing the file path names.\nEach email message appears to be stored as a plain text file with a name like number.emlx, e.g. 55219.emlx. One way to find the appropriate file is find a distinctive phrase in the message, and to use grep from the command line to find a file containing this phrase. Thus, [linebreaks added for readability]\n% grep -l 'Repair Cafe January 18' ~/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-@mykolab.com@imap.mykolab.com\n    /INBOX.mbox/*/Data/*/*/Messages/*.emlx\n/Users/myuser/Library/Mail/V2/IMAP-@mykolab.com@imap.mykolab.com\n    /INBOX.mbox/393BA6E1-145B-E29D-536F-306645CA9917/Data/3/5/Messages/53938.emlx\n\nHowever, don't assume that you can safely delete these files out from under the Mail application. It might get confused by the unexpected absence of the file. It might simply recreate the file from the copy on the IMAP server.\n", "Q: Multiple display setup mac, ignore separation between displays I am currently setting up my workstation, and I want to use the set up pictured here:\n\nAs you can see, the display on the top is turned sideways, and that is the way I want it.\nThe question is this: how can I make the cursor jump between the left and right monitors and the top monitor smoothly (rather, at all), as if the top display was just as wide as the bottom center display?

It's a little magnifying glass in the menu bar, towards the top and right of the screen.\nWhat you probably hit was ⌥Option+⌘Command+⇧Shift.\n", "Q: Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in Yosemite? Is there a way to completely disable Spaces in Yosemite (without turning off Mission Control, Dashboard, etc.)? \nAs someone who frequently switches between multiple monitors and using my Macbook on its own, I frequently run into baffling setups where windows on one monitor become a Space on another monitor. I'd like to end this behavior. \n\nA: I think I got the solution:\nIF you only want to disable the spaces option, open mision control (by pressing F9, or by the Mission Control key (also F3). Once your spaces are shown on the upper part of the screen, you can just go over your diferent \"spaces\" with you mouse and then a cross will appear letting you shut down.\n\nhope this is helpful!\n\nA: I did this recently to get an iMac to better support an X-Arcade Tankstick and MAME.

I have to resort to using CTRL+Left click. I have tried it with a different mouse (non Apple) and experienced the same problem. I also tried switching the secondary button to Left just to make sure it wasn't something specific with the L/R button. When I do that, the secondary click doesn't work even if it is the left button. \nThe only way I have solved this is to do a full restart. I suspect logging out and back in may fix this. \nI think this is a driver issue somewhere. Any Ideas?\nI am running Yosemite with all the latest patches.

Would like to put the updater/installer on a USB drive.\non the apple site, there are direct downloads for older versions of iphoto, but not the latest.\nI was also able to download yosemite and put it on a usb drive.  but not iphoto\n\nA: You can put the new iPhoto itself on a USB drive, and just replace the file in Applications (after taking the necessary backup precautions, of course). It should work fine.\nSource: My own experience, having upgraded a computer to Yosemite with the sole available wifi network having a finite amount of data.\n", "Q: Why are Script Editor .scpt files not saved as plain text files? The Script Editor (formerly AppleScript Editor pre-Yosemite 10.10) saves .scpt files as binary files, not plain text files.\nIt makes working with them in source code control systems somewhat cumbersome.\nDoes anyone know why this is the case? Is there some long-standing history that necessitated this file format be something other than plain text files?\n\nA: William R. Cook's paper contains an excellent history and insight from those involved with AppleScript in 1989.\nWhat follows is fun and speculative.\nConservation of Space and Processing\nAppleScript was written at a time when every byte and bit was valuable. OS X's lazy encoding as property list formats would be wasteful in the eyes' of those early developers.\nThe binary format provided a pre-parsed form that avoided duplicating the complex, error prone, and time consuming parsing process with each load from disk. Better to load directly into memory and run.\nAdaptive\nSaving in a binary format allowed AppleScripts to be tied to the underlying AppleEvent codes rather that their dictionary of long form terminology.\nThis would allow an AppleScript written and saved against one version of an application to automatically update to terminology changes between versions of the targeted applications.\nAn integer object might be called 'integer' in the script but saved as the four character code 'int ' in the binary representation. The four character code coming from the AppleScript dictionary provided by the operating system.\nIf a future AppleScript terminology decided to alter the user facing word for integer, the binary representation could map to the newer name.\nA flip side to this is possible to see today. Write an AppleScript against an application's dictionary. Then remove the application entirely from your Mac. What do you see in Script Editor upon opening the script?\nAt least in recent versions, AppleScript Editor showed chevrons surrounding the four character code. The code has been remembered and highlighted. Not the user facing terminology.\nThis is probably not the primary benefit but a possible benefit.\nModern Bias\nIt is worth acknowledging our modern bias for text documents. Experience has taught many of us that storing valuable content in a binary format carries risk. Binary formats are often poorly documented, opaque to the end user, and difficult to open when the owning software is not maintained.\nWhen AppleScript and it's binary format were created, this bias was not yet formed. Storage and computational limits were very real and every kilobyte or thousands of cycles saved were worthwhile.\nHistory and Origins\nThe stories of AppleScript's origin are wonderful but difficult to track down these days. AppleScript tried to be a friendly, English language like, language and was breath taking in its vision; the actual implementation was harder to get right!\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript by William R. Cook\n\n*AppleScript - a story worth telling\n\nA: After seeing the decompile command shared by Fartheraway I discovered the solution. If you want the applescript (.scpt) file to not be binary.\n@fartheraway also mentions it in the bottom of his answer.\nsimply do all development with .applescript extension. \nThe Script Editor will be able to run the code and it will not save it in a compiled format. \n\nA: In short, .scpt allows backward compatibility. Plus, applescript/javascript (etc) can saved with the same extension, given that Script Editor now supports javascript.\nTo decompile .scpt in shell:\nhttps://github.com/rupa/applescript/blob/master/decompile.sh\nThe most relevant part:\nosadecompile\n\nTextmate is a third-party editor that can read .scpt:\nhttps://github.com/textmate/textmate/blob/master/Applications/decompile_as/src/decompile_as.mm\nThe most relevant part:\n[[OSAScript alloc] initWithCompiledData:];\n\nThis function comes from OSAScript.h, apart of OS X SDK. In OSAScript.h, there is this lengthy comment:\n\nGiven a URL that locates a compiled script, script application, or script source, create and return an autoreleased script data descriptor with its contents. You may use the descriptor to create a script with -[OSAScript initWithScriptDataDescriptor:...]. This enables you to create a script with a specific OSALanguageInstance. You may use +[OSALanguage languageForScriptDataDescriptor:] to get the language for the script data, which may then be used to create or select an appropriate language instance for an OSAScript. Script source data may be compiled by -[OSAScript initWithScriptDataDescriptor:...], or you can coerce the descriptor to a string (using NSAppleEventDescriptor methods) and explicitly create an OSAScript with the source.\n  + (NSAppleEventDescriptor *)scriptDataDescriptorWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)url AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_6_AND_LATER;\n\nBasically, when saved .scpt, an OSALanguageInstance descriptor is also saved in the file. \nIf a file is saved as .applescript/text, the system will compile it with lastest version of applescript language. A script, for example, written for an older version of OS X may not work on a new version because some functions have become obsolete. With .scpt, the system/app have pick out what version of applescipt it's meant for.\nFrom 10.10, javascript can be saved in .scpt and be executed correctly.\n", "Q: How to snooze reminders on the notification screen?

I really like the 3rd party Swype keyboard, but it is missing the Mic button.  Is there a gesture or something to engage the Siri Microphone?\n\nA: No, this is currently not possible due to restrictions with 3rd-party keyboards in iOS.\nFrom Apple site:\n\nCustom keyboards, like all app extensions in iOS 8.0, have no access to the device microphone, so dictation input is not possible.\n\n", "Q: Is there an option to delete old photos off my iPod?

My windows PC crashed and I need access to my photos from iCloud. I installed the iCloud control panel but it only shows my photo stream which is roughly 30 days of photos.\nI need to restore ALL of my photos from an iCloud backup to my windows PC.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: iLoot (free) can help you for iCloud restoring! no device needed!\njust tried it, worked fine and restored everything. \n\nA: If the photos are still on your phone, the simplest way would be to wire it up & import to Windows Essentials Photo Gallery, or push them via Dropbox etc.\nAs far as I'm aware, iCloud only stores the last 30 days or 1000 photos. It doesn't keep them all long-term.\nFrom No, iCloud Isn’t Backing Them All Up: How to Manage Photos on Your iPhone or iPad\n\nAre the photos you take with your iPhone or iPad backed up in case you lose your device? If you’re just relying on iCloud to manage your important memories, your photos may not be backed up at all.\nApple’s iCloud has a photo-syncing feature in the form of “Photo Stream,” but Photo Stream doesn’t actually perform any long-term backups of your photos.\niCloud’s Photo Backup Limitations\n  Assuming you’ve set up iCloud on your iPhone or iPad, your device is using a feature called “Photo Stream” to automatically upload the photos you take to your iCloud storage and sync them across your devices. Unfortunately, there are some big limitations here.\n1000 Photos: Photo Stream only backs up the latest 1000 photos. Do you have 1500 photos in your Camera Roll folder on your phone? If so, only the latest 1000 photos are stored in your iCloud account online. If you don’t have those photos backed up elsewhere, you’ll lose them when you lose your phone. If you have 1000 photos and take one more, the oldest photo will be removed from your iCloud Photo Stream.  \n30 Days: Apple also states that photos in your Photo Stream will be automatically deleted after 30 days “to give your devices plenty of time to connect and download them.” Some people report photos aren’t deleted after 30 days, but it’s clear you shouldn’t rely on iCloud for more than 30 days of storage.\niCloud Storage Limits: Apple only gives you 5 GB of iCloud storage space for free, and this is shared between backups, documents, and all other iCloud data. This 5 GB can fill up pretty quickly. If your iCloud storage is full and you haven’t purchased any more storage more from Apple, your photos aren’t being backed up.\nVideos Aren’t Included: Photo Stream doesn’t include videos, so any videos you take aren’t automatically backed up.\nIt’s clear that iCloud’s Photo Stream isn’t designed as a long-term way to store your photos, just a convenient way to access recent photos on all your devices before you back them up for real.\n\nSee also My Photo Stream FAQ\n", "Q: Problem after erasing the HD of a brand new Mac (OS X Yosemite) with Disk Utility I cannot reinstall OS X Yosemite now, as there's no hard drive I could see. \nI had erased the HD with the idea that it will create a new partition but it didn't, so now I can't see a hard disk on disk utility.

Or the migration assistant from Apple?  \nI need to move all the data, applications, settings, etc.\n\nA: From my point of view, best option is Migration Assistant.\nYou can select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which users you want to migrate.\n\n*If you want to migrate or no the installed apps.\n\n*Allow to migrate settings or not.\n\n*You can select other files.\n\n\nYou can use it with Wifi or Ethernet, FireWire or ThunderBolt.\nDisk clone is an option for me, when the target machine have the same configuration as origin machine.\n\nA: If you're pressed for time, by all means use jherran's answer and Migration Assistant.\nBut if you have time, I would recommend manually moving everything across. This means you get to evaluate whether you actually need this (app|video|picture) anymore, or if it's just taking up HDD/SSD space. On the flip side, it's possible that you miss some things.\nMy procedure when I get a new Mac is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the old one into Target Disk Mode and connect it to the new one, usually over Firewire/Thunderbolt\n\n*Bring across obvious data folders - ~/Desktop, ~/Documents, ~/Pictures, etc.\n\n*Go through /Applications (and ~/Applications, if you use it) and evaluate each app before bringing it across - do I really need this still?\n\n*Open each app and look for settings/configuration to bring across. \n\n*I use Homebrew, so I run brew list on the old machine and have Brew install everything I think I still need on the new machine. Same with other utilities like nvm, rvm, etc.\n\n*Keep the old machine around for a month or two. In that month or two, I should have to use everything that can't be regenerated. This time frame might be different for you.\n\n\nAgain, this is for people that can afford to spend some time rebuilding their machine. However, it does have a couple advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're so inclined, you can hide the old machine and 'practice' rebuilding from your backups (you have them, right?)\n\n*You prune down your machine of old cruft that isn't needed anymore, thus improving performance. And you feel better about it.\n\n", "Q: Slow mac when Terminal have been open for some time When I have Terminal.app open for some time (mostly after 2-3 hours), everything starts getting slow.

There's nothing in your screenshots that points to Terminal. Nor anything in my experience—I let Terminal run for days with no ill effect.\nIt's possible that you're starting some task that's running away with the processor. You could set Activity Monitor to show all processes hierarchically, and give the tasks running directly under Terminal closer scrutiny, but I'd be more inclined to think that whatever it is is something you've spawned off as a separate process (using & at the end of a command).\nDoes quitting Terminal give you your performance back right away? That would indicate that the process is still running as a subtask of Terminal.\nEither way, set Activity Monitor to show All Processes, and sort the list by % CPU. See what floats to the top.\nIs there anything unusual about your $PROMPT_COMMAND? This is a command that gets run by the shell just before it displays the prompt. Seems to me to be a place where a time-waster could hide.\nADDENDUM: I just noticed your comment \"...when I have an ssh session open to one of my servers\". Do you also accept incoming ssh sessions? It's possible that you're under attack. Someone is trying to open an ssh session back to you, and is guessing passwords. If they're guessing very fast, they can bring your machine to its knees.\nI thought of that earlier, because I've seen that happen when I enable Remote Login and have a publicly visible IP address. Once the bad guys notice that your port 22 is open from the WAN (and they will, within hours), they'll slam it with login attempts. The (temporary) fix is to disable Remote Login for a few minutes. They'll get bored and turn their attention elsewhere, and you have a respite of a few hours until another bad guy notices the open port.\nBut you say the problem goes away as soon as you quit Terminal, which sounds like a different problem. UNLESS you have some watchdog on your system that automatically opens port 22 (i.e., enables Remote Login) only while Terminal is running, and automatically closes it when Terminal quits. Or I imagine it could be possible to configure a firewall so that it allows incoming connections to port 22 only while there is currently an outgoing connection to port 22. Or only from remote addresses that you have an outgoing connection to, and the server you're connecting to is infected. Quitting Terminal closes all your ssh sessions, which would make the firewall stop accepting ssh incoming sessions, breaking the attack. Just a guess.\nTo see if you're under this kind of attack, open Activity Monitor and filter the process list for \"sshd\". If you see lots of very short-lived sshd processes, someone is trying to guess your password. Even if you don't allow password access, they don't know that and will try anyway. \n\nA: My guess would be that you have a very, very large scrollback buffer active and that it takes up your memory.\nSee if \n\nhelps (must be applied separately in each window).  The default value for this is \"available memory\".  You may want to change it in settings to a suitable number of lines instead.\n", "Q: Force Splotlight to search a subfolder Background:\nI moved the Microsoft User Data from ~/Documents to ~/Library/Preferences because I didn't want Google Drive to sync my Office files.

(If you don't see \"System files\" as an option, select \"Other\". Scroll through the list to find \"System files\", or instead of scrolling start typing \"System files\" in the search field. Optionally, turn on the check mark to add \"System files\" to the menu so you won't have to look for it again.)\nAnything whose name starts with a period (like .olk14Message in your case) is considered invisible. Spotlight won't find anything that's invisible or in an invisible folder unless you either start in the invisible folder or add a search term for \"File visibility\" that says to report invisible items.\nmdimport won't help here. Spotlight has already indexed even System files and Invisible files. It just won't show them to you unless you specifically ask for them.\nFor mdutil -E ..., you need to specify a volume, not a folder. Thus, for example, mdutil -E / would erase (and probably rebuild) the Spotlight index for your entire boot volume. You can't select anything smaller than a volume.\n", "Q: Four Apple Monitors on a Macbook Pro I have a 15\" Mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro and would like to hook additional monitors to it. Ideally, these would be 4x 27\" Apple Displays of some sort.\nI have done a bit of Googling, but information on this sort of configuration seems to be a bit sparse. Here's what I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*This model can officially support 2x Thunderbolt Displays.\n\n*Thunderbolt displays can be daisy-chained.\n\n*Apple LED Cinema Displays (Mini DisplayPort model) can be daisy-chained off of Thunderbolt displays, but only if there are 1 or more thunderbolt devices separating them, and them \n\n*USB to (mini) DisplayPort adapters (external video cards) exist, but can only output at 720p to an iMac or Cinema Display.\n\n*USB to Thunderbolt adapters do not exist at this point. (And probably never will)\n\n*It is easy to go from (mini) DisplayPort to HDMI, but not the other way.\n\n\nBased on the above, I have come up with several options in decreasing order of preference. (Ranging from simple/elegant to hackish) I'd like to know if anyone has tried any of these, and what kind of success you have had, or if you've done something different that I haven't thought of.\nOne last thing. When these monitors are plugged in, the computer will be in clamshell mode in a Henge vertical dock, so it won't need to power the internal display.\nOption 1:\n4 Thunderbolt displays. Two plugged into the thunderbolt ports, one daisy-chained off of each of those.\nI understand that this probably won't work, but am wondering if anyone has tried it.\nOption 2:\nTwo Thunderbolt Displays, each with an LED Cinema Display hooked up to it with, something in between (ie. a docking station)\nI understand that this configuration will work if I hook up 1 pair, but need to know if the computer can handle 2.\nOption 3:\nSome way of getting a DisplayPort signal from a USB video card, Two thunderbolt displays, and two DisplayPort displays.\nI haven't been able to find anything here, but if anyone knows about anything, I would really appreciate it.\n\nA: EveryMac has some words of warning on trying to run 3 additional displays from a MacBook Pro…\n\nOn a 15-Inch Retina Display MacBook Pro, site sponsor OWC briefly tested three external displays -- two iMacs used as displays at 2560x1440 via Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt/DisplayPort and an LG monitor at 1920x1200 via HDMI -- and shared that \"moving images and media didn't create any lag and we were able to play video on all four displays simultaneously.\"\nHowever, in more detailed evaluation, a helpful EveryMac.com reader reported:\nI have a \"Mid-2012\" Retina Display MacBook Pro with two 27\" Thunderbolt Displays daisy chained in clamshell mode. I tried adding a third 1920x1200 Dell monitor via the HDMI port, and it actually does work. But here is the catch: with no external displays, the system fans hover around 2600 RPM. With two 27\" Thunderbolt Displays, regardless of what I do, the fans hover around 2800-3200 RPM. The GPU diode temp reads 69°C (156°F). If I force it via a fan control program to run at 2500 RPM, the GPU heats up. I was afraid of damaging my computer so I turned the fans back to auto-mode.\n  Now the kicker. I tried with the three monitors and the fans go up to 4800 RPM. That's without doing anything. If I start running a YouTube clip, or do anything remotely CPU or graphics intensive, the fans max out at 5900 RPM (which is the max the machine will do). I exceeded that by having a few videos running at the same time, fired up 3 virtual machines, and had it compile some code. The whole system became choppy and it began stuttering.\n  Since then, I've never used three monitors, just the two Apple Thunderbolt Displays. Apple probably doesn't officially recommend using three displays because it gets too hot.\nUltimately, although the Retina Display MacBook Pro models are technically capable of running three external displays as well as the internal one, the above reader is highly likely to be correct. Although Apple does not formally provide a reason for why only two external displays are supported, it is clear that the system can overheat with three connected. Consequently, EveryMac.com does not recommend running more than two external displays on the Retina Display MacBook Pro models.\n\n\nA: DisplayLink produces some chipsets that allow to convert HDMI / DVI video stream to USB. Plugable and Anker sell them (around 50-60 USD for one converter). It works for Windows and sometime on Mac (check the product's description). There is some experimental support for Linux. On Mac OS X you can plug up to 4 monitors this way.\nOtherwise you can give a shot to Kanex Thunderbolt to eSATA + USB 3.0 Adapter (I haven't tried it).\n", "Q: Using modified SMS database with iOS I've been trying to remove a specific text from my iPhone's SMS database.

We played the sound and found the touch in her bedroom, but it's still showing on the map that it is in California.  What can be making it show that it's in a different location than it is?\n\nA: Since iPods don't use cellular or GPS data it relies on wifi triangulation to get the closest GPS coordinates. I would simply reset your iPod touch so it can reboot based off the current network.\n\nA: Location Services could be off. It may be showing the last location it \"saw\" it (which obviously isn't correct)\n\nA: Are you using a VPN on the iPod?  That could make it think it's somewhere it isn't.  Also, what is your ISP?

Meaning, I reformatted it, and normally the little sun button \"New\" would then allow me to proceed with the Windows install. \nI thought it was very weird so I instead deleted the partition, which turned into a 47.3Gb of Unallocated Space.\nI tried formatting said unallocated space which created a bunch more partitions, but ultimately the same problem persisted: Can't install Windows.\nIn OSX, the Disk Utility wouldn't let me actually delete or remove the partitions so I went back to the Windows install menu and turned all the undesirables into unallocated space.\n\nHere's what my Disk Utility looks like now:\n\nAs you can see there's some purple stuff at the top and some dark-grey stuff at the bottom, which I imagine represents free space?\nFinally, here's a diskutil list readout:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         948.5 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *1.1 TB     disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2\n                                 A952E93D-0902-4BEC-B4D2-93A8BB1CDDD0\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *16.0 GB    disk3\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WININSTALL              16.0 GB    disk3s1\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*WTF happened? \n\n*How can I reset everything to the way it was so I can\ntry bootcamp again? \n\n*More specifically, how do I add unallocated space\nto my primary OSX partition?\n\n*List item\nPlease help!\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't know what exactly happened, usually it works.\nTo get back to your original disk layout, just format the unallocated space with the Window installer (FAT32 or NTFS), boot to OS X and open Bootcamp Assistant.\nSkip building an installation medium or downloading any drivers, just remove the Windows Partition.\nIf that doesn't work give me a comment.

When that part is done it prompts you to reboot and after a while gives you a simple graphical view of your disk space that you can drag left to make the Windows Partition bigger and the Mac's smaller. \nPardon the statement of the obvious but that is what should have happened, is that the way it went?\nOnce the partitioning is done you boot into the Windows installer and get the partition chooser you showed at the top of your post. At that point you should do nothing but verify that you have the correct partition selected and click on NEXT, ignoring all of the other buttons.\nThat is how it should go. It is easy enough to be confused by the options or even just click the wrong thing. Hell, I've done it myself and wiped my Mac's drive, thank god for backups!\nIf something did not go that way run Bootcamp from the start and recreate your install media and try again. Note down every mouse click and thing you typed, so if it fails again we can figure out where...\n\nA: What worked for me: Don't format or create new partition, just select \"Unallocated Space\" during the Windows install and click \"Next\"\nAnything else will result in a failure.\n", "Q: How to recover TextEdit files? I just quit TextEdit and forgot to save my files that I have been working on for 2 weeks. I'm about to cry.\nPlease tell me how can I recover them?\n\nA: If you quit TextEdit, then reopening TextEdit will re-open all your documents. If it didn't give you an option to save, then they were stored by Restore in the Saved Application State. When you next open the app, they should have been there as the application state is restored. If this did not occur, then something else went wrong and the application state was either not saved or not restored correctly (e.g. force quit whilst opening will cancel restoration of application state).\nIf you closed TextEdit, then all the documents will be closed, and clicking Don't Save will delete them and you will not be able to recover them.\n\nA: If you know the name of your file(s), try using Spotlight (cmd + space) to search for them.\n", "Q: How to open numbers spreadsheet in 2 separate windows I often find it useful to have two tabs of one spreadsheet open in separate windows. In Excel this is easy (Windows/New Window).\nIs there any way to achieve this in Numbers (as of Version 3.5)?\nFor the record, I've tried searching for an answer to this, but needless to say, searches including \"Numbers\" and \"Windows\" doesn't lead to anything useful.\n\nA: Thinking about this some more, I have figured out a workaround. Though it's not altogether satisfactory, it could be useful in some cases. The workaround is iCloud.\nSave the Numbers spreadsheet to iCloud drive, and then open it from a web browser. Open a new browser window and again open the spreadsheet from iCloud drive and you now have the spreadsheet open in 2 windows.\nYou could also have a local copy open in Numbers, with additional windows provided by iCloud browser windows, though there would be some lag between local changes appearing in iCloud and visa versa.\n\nA: There is a (clumsy) workaround. From the File menu select Duplicate and a new window will open with a copy of the spreadsheet. Just be care to use it only to read and make updates to the original spreadsheet. When you are done, you can close and choose delete on the copy.\n\nA: This is currently not possible. You can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html\n\nA: As a workaround - you can open a spreadsheet, then press Cmd+N, choose the first template, and open the spreadsheet from that new window.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately Numbers does not support two windows like Excel but there are alternatives.\nFirstly open the Numbers file in Numbers and the second file in Preview. Resize the windows and each can be seen alongside each other and compared. Only the numbers file can be edited but the comparison of two spreadsheets and the cross referencing of information is good. The thing to do is to open the file which you want to alter or change in Numbers. \nYou can also do this with one window using Numbers and the other OpenOffice which is a free download. When you then have two windows open you can swap between programmes and not only compare files but alter both if needed . I find this a good way to compare say membership lists and reconcile payments against Bank statements.     \nTransfer of files from numbers to OpenOffice is easy as Numbers will export to a different format including CSV and this can then be taken up in Office.\n", "Q: Update iOS on jailbroken iPhone 5S with evasi0n7 *without USB* I jailbreaked my iPhone 5S with evasi0n7 [iOS 7.0.4] a few months ago.\nThe thing is, that I accidently broke my USB driver on the iPhone (I can still charge the phone but not connect it to any USB data port).\nI want to update my iPhone to iOS 8 and delete the Jailbreak.

Now it doesn't work at all and won't even allow me to reinstall after I deleted it. Is that because I'm still running IOS 5.1.1? Can I upgrade my operating system to IOS 7 or 8 on IPad 1?\n\nA: iOS 5.1.1 is the last version of iOS you can run on a first-generation iPad.\n", "Q: How can OS X perform \"VPN Single Sign On\"? Windows can perform \"VPN Single Sign On\" whereby a (pre-configured) VPN connection is initiated from the login screen using the provided user credentials and, once established, the user is authenticated against the corporate directory server.\nOnly after successfully completing such a login can a remote client be used.\nHow can the same be accomplished with OS X?\n\nA: You could use tunnelblick, as a front end to OpenVPN. Once installed, it runs automatically when the user logs on. It can also be configured to connect automatically, in the VPN Details dialog:\n\nIt appears to work with OpenDirectory also, starting from version 3.1beta16 (I am currently using version 3.4.2). Taken from the release notes (What's New in Tunnelblick 3.1beta16 (Changes from 3.1beta14))\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixes issues when using OpenDirectory and the user's home directory is on a non-Mac platform.\n\n\nSo, in short, while it doesn't provide the VPN logon at the login screen as requested, the end result is pretty much the same - you log in and have the VPN connection already running.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Little Snitch alone is adequate. Some combination of Little Snitch, or with Apple Server software will accomplish what you seek. Once set, Little Snitch will prohibit/allow outgoing connections based on a saved (password protected) configuration. Only VPN can be configured such that that user will be unable to connect except through enabled connections. The user will have to sign into the VPN server after login manually or via keychain.\n\nApple Server is also pretty versatile, and Apple Enterprise Server support is quite good, especially since it comes free with the $20 Server software. \n\nA: Here is an answer Apple provides:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH15510\n\nMavericks Server Admin: Single sign-on authentication\nOS X Server uses Kerberos for single sign-on authentication, which\n  relieves users from entering a name and password separately for every\n  service. With single sign-on, a user always enters a name and password\n  in the login window. Thereafter, the user does not need to enter a\n  name and password for AFP service, Mail service, or other services\n  that use Kerberos authentication.\nTo take advantage of single sign-on, users and services must be\n  Kerberized—configured for Kerberos authentication—and use the same\n  Kerberos KDC server.\nUser accounts that reside in an LDAP directory of a Mac server and\n  have a password type of Open Directory use the server’s built-in KDC.\n  These user accounts are configured for Kerberos and single sign-on.\n  The server’s Kerberized services use the server’s built-in KDC and are\n  configured for single sign-on.\nThis Mac server KDC can also authenticate users for services provided\n  by other servers. Having more servers with OS X Server use the Mac\n  server KDC requires only minimal configuration.\nKerberos authentication\nKerberos was developed at MIT to provide secure authentication and\n  communication over open networks like the Internet. It’s named for the\n  three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to the underworld of Greek\n  mythology.\nKerberos provides proof of identity for two parties. It enables you to\n  prove who you are to network services you want to use. It also proves\n  to your applications that network services are genuine, not spoofed.\nLike other authentication systems, Kerberos does not provide\n  authorization. Each network service determines what you are permitted\n  to do based on your proven identity.\nKerberos permits a client and a server to identify each other much\n  more securely than typical challenge-response password authentication\n  methods. Kerberos also provides a single sign-on environment where\n  users authenticate only once a day, week, or other period of time,\n  thereby easing authentication frequency.\nOS X Server offers integrated Kerberos support that virtually anyone\n  can deploy. In fact, Kerberos deployment is so automatic that users\n  and administrators may not realize it’s deployed.\nIt is the default setting for user accounts in the Mac server LDAP\n  directory. Other services provided by the LDAP directory server, such\n  as AFP and Mail service, also use Kerberos automatically.\nIf your network has other servers with OS X Server, joining them to\n  the Kerberos server is easy, and most of their services use Kerberos\n  automatically.\nAlternatively, if your network has a Kerberos system such as Microsoft\n  Active Directory, you can set up your Mac server and Mac computers to\n  use it for authentication.\nThe Internet is inherently insecure, yet few authentication protocols\n  provide real security. Malicious hackers can use readily available\n  software tools to intercept passwords being sent over a network.\nMany applications send passwords unencrypted, and these are ready to\n  use as soon as they’re intercepted. Even encrypted passwords are not\n  completely safe. Given enough time and computing power, encrypted\n  passwords can be cracked.\nTo isolate passwords on your private network you can use a firewall,\n  but this does not solve all problems. For example, a firewall does not\n  provide security against disgruntled or malicious insiders.\nKerberos was designed to solve network security problems. It never\n  transmits the user’s password across the network, nor does it save the\n  password in the user’s computer memory or on disk. Therefore, even if\n  the Kerberos credentials are cracked or compromised, the attacker does\n  not learn the original password, so he or she can potentially\n  compromise only a small portion of the network.\nIn addition to superior password management, Kerberos is also mutually\n  authenticated. The client authenticates to the service, and the\n  service authenticates to the client. A man-in-the-middle or spoofing\n  attack is impossible when you are using Kerberized services, and that\n  means users can trust the services they are accessing.\nKerberos is available on every major platform, including OS X,\n  Windows, Linux, and other UNIX variants.\nMove beyond passwords\nNetwork authentication is difficult: to deploy a network\n  authentication method, the client and server must agree on the\n  authentication method. Although it is possible for client/server\n  processes to agree on a custom authentication method, getting\n  pervasive adoption across a suite of network protocols, platforms, and\n  clients is virtually impossible.\nFor example, suppose you want to deploy smart cards as a network\n  authentication method. Without Kerberos, you must change every\n  client/server protocol to support the new method. The list of\n  protocols includes SMTP, POP, IMAP, AFP, SMB, HTTP, FTP, IPP, SSH,\n  QuickTime Streaming, DNS, LDAP, local directory domain, RPC, NFS, AFS,\n  WebDAV, and LPR, and goes on and on.\nConsidering all the software that does network authentication,\n  deploying a new authentication method across the entire suite of\n  network protocols would be a daunting task. Although this might be\n  feasible for software from one vendor, you’d be unlikely to get all\n  vendors to change their client software to use your new method.\n  Further, you’d probably also want your authentication to work on\n  multiple platforms (such as OS X, Windows, and UNIX).\nDue to the design of Kerberos, a client/server binary protocol that\n  supports Kerberos doesn’t even know how the user proves identity.\n  Therefore you only need to change the Kerberos client and the Kerberos\n  server to accept a new proof of identity such as a smart card. As a\n  result, your entire Kerberos network has now adopted the new\n  proof-of-identity method, without deploying new versions of client and\n  server software.\nKerberos provides a central authentication authority for the network.\n  All Kerberos-enabled services and clients use this central authority.\n  Administrators can centrally audit and control authentication policies\n  and operations.\nKerberos can authenticate users for the following services of a Mac\n  server:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Login window\n  \n*Mail service\n  \n*AFP file service\n  \n*FTP file service\n  \n*SMB file service (as a member of an Active Directory Kerberos realm)\n  \n*VPN service\n  \n*Apache web service\n  \n*LDAP directory service\n  \n*Messages service\n  \n*NFS file service\n  \n  \n  These services have been Kerberized whether they are running or not.\n  Only services that are Kerberized can use Kerberos to authenticate a\n  user. OS X Server includes command-line tools for Kerberizing other\n  services that are compatible with MIT-based Kerberos.\nSingle sign-on experience\nKerberos is a credential or ticket-based system. The user logs in once\n  to the Kerberos system and is issued a ticket with a life span. During\n  the life span of this ticket the user doesn’t need to authenticate\n  again to access a Kerberized service.\nThe user’s Kerberized client software, such as the Mail application,\n  presents a valid Kerberos ticket to authenticate the user for a\n  Kerberized service. This provides a single sign-on experience.\nA Kerberos ticket is like a press pass to a jazz festival held at\n  multiple nightclubs over a three-day weekend. You prove your identity\n  once to get the pass. Until the pass expires, you can show it at any\n  nightclub to get a ticket for a performance. All participating\n  nightclubs accept your pass without seeing your proof of identity\n  again.\n\n", "Q: iTunes movie classification I have a few .mp4 files that I have added to iTunes.\nSome are classified as Home Movies and other are My Movies.\nI was wondering if there is any way to change this maybe by converting to a certain file type. I was also wondering how does iTunes determine this.\n\nA: In iTunes, Get Info on the specific video. From the Options tab, select Media Kind and change it to Movie or the appropriate format.\niTunes selects the Media Kind based on any metadata it can parse from the file. Lacking anything for .mp4 files, it defaults them to Home Video.\nIf you have movies ripped from DVD and want to add metadata, take a look at MetaZ. (It's the replacement for the old MetaX when that stopped being updated and functionality broke.) iTunes properly reads the metadata that MetaZ embeds. You will want to remove the files from iTunes, process with MetaZ and then re-import them into iTunes.\n\nA: Or use Subler, which allows auto & manual metadata & poster art tagging as well as muxing/remuxing of any of a video file’s subtitle, audio, chapter or closed caption tracks. It’s very light weight & I prefer it to all the other video taggers I’ve tried. You can change the ‘type’ of file from home video to movie very easily as well as set HD and other tags. Any changes made to a file already appearing in your iTunes library should be automatically revealed when you either click it to reveal the cast & synopsis information or with Get Info; in other words, you do not need to remove the file & reimport it, as the changes will be recognized in place. Just make sure you go up to the File menu item & hit Save. \n", "Q: Which Transcend Jetdrive Lite fits into MB Pro 13\" early 2011? I want to expand my MB Pro diskspace by a seamless SD-card.

My old MBA (2008) is not booting anymore from hdd. I tried to repair it with disk repair and with a DiskWarrior CD-ROM, but nothing. I need to copy some data from the hdd, before replacing it.\nAny ideas on how to do that?\n\nA: I would started with getting that drive out of MBA with the instruction from iFixit for example.\nThen I would buy one of these IDE to 40 pin ZIF adapters and find yourself old PC or Mac with IDE connection.\nFire up DiskWarrior or R-Studio (on Windows) or better and cheaper with DDRescue.\nIf you want to check if HDD is physically sound you might also try MHDD or Victoria tools (they are DOS and Windows only though).\nAnd if you want to replace that HDD better go with SSD. At least 64GB SSD will do big boost to this old bugger. Provided you have Nvidia in yours. If it is intel I would just replace HDD and sell it.\n\nA: Edit: This model doesn’t support TDM. A functionally equivalent alternative: you can remove the HDD from the machine and use an external drive enclosure to try and mount the disk as an external drive on another machine in the same fashion.\n\nIf you have access to another Mac and a Firewire cable (along with FW > Thunderbolt adapter if the Mac does not have FW port), you can attempt to mount the drive as an external drive on the other Mac using Target Disk Mode. If the drive doesn’t mount, however, it’s more than likely bricked. \n\n\"Target Disk Mode is useful for accessing the contents of a Mac which cannot be booted from its own operating system.\"\n\nData recovery companies offer costlier solutions and do not guarantee success.

Blurring the image makes the selection process (of which to show) much easier.\nIs there a way to do this in Safari? Perhaps as an extension?\nAs a bonus, if there is a way to whitelist a set of images or sites (e.g.: the voting buttons in Stackexchange), that would be great.\n\nA: The following approach comes pretty close, but it does not (nor can it) cover images that are set as background. It might also slow down page loading a bit. \nThe goal is to inject custom CSS into the page. I'll use the add-on Stylish for that (theoretically you could do it without any external add-ons, but you need a free Safari developer ID to do so - see here - I was wrong, see @markhunte's answer). After installing Stylish, you will see a great 'S' button next to the URL field. Click it and select 'manage'. In the new tab, select 'Edit' to create a new style. Give it a title (perhaps 'Blurred images'), and paste the following CSS into the 'CSS' field:\nimg {\n  -webkit-filter: blur(10px);\n}\nimg:active {\n  -webkit-filter: blur(0px);\n}\n\nUnder 'Applies to:' select 'global (if you want, you could narrow it down to specific URLs, URL prefixes, domains etc.), then save the style to enable it.\nIf you load a webpage, all images (except for background images) will be blurred. If you click an image it will be un-blurred as long as you hold your mouse-button down. You can customize the degree of blur by editing the pixel value in the first selector as the second selector un-blurs the image.\nThis is all you can do in plain CSS. If you want a selective whitelist that persists across sessions, you definitely need to write your own extensions. This still comes down to applying the CSS posted above, but the whitelist and the 'click-to-add' part may be a bit more complicated and I do not have enough experience to give you a helpful answer in that case.\n\nA: This is an add on to @thee's answer.\nYou can add the css code in their answer without third party apps or a Developers id.\ncreate a .css file by pasting the code as plain text in to  a text file.\nYou can use TextEdit.app to do this.

The app, in fact, has a setting to disable backing up to iTunes, but the setting doesn't work for me because I've already got it disabled. Is there a way to control this myself, so that this app and its contents are not backed up to iTunes?\n\nA: On your iPhone go to Settings -> General -> Storage & iCloud Usage -> Manage Storage -> . Here you have Backup Options and you can select which apps to include in the backup.\n\nA: No you cannot. Apple makes you do a full system backup so they can get all your data saved to their servers. This means all apps and all app data are copied to your computer through iTunes and a list of all your files is sent to Apple secretly every time you plug in the iPhone to your computer. Also it is Apple's marketing policy to make advance users suffer, while reducing basic users' confusions by providing less options all together.

Specifically, I want to replace my 125 GB SSD with a 250 GB SSD, and my optical drive with a 1 TB HDD.\nThe SSD inside my MacBook already has a cabinet, I assume. Hence, I do not need to get another cabinet for the new SSD. I can use the same SATA cable too, correct? However, I need a cabinet for the HDD, and I was thinking of getting an OptiBay for my unibody Mac. I will need a new SATA cable to connect the new HDD, though, right? Do I need some kind of special SATA cable, or will any do? How long does it need to be? About 10-15 cm?\nAs for tools, I think all I need is a regular X screwdriver and a Torx size 6.\nHave I assessed my needs correctly? I want to have everything in order before I begin the procedure.\n\nA: I made a similar modification to my 13\" mid-2009 MacBook Pro and used the OWC Data Doubler. You don't need to provide a SATA cable, rather the frame (OptiBay or Data Doubler) used to mount the hard drive in place of the optical drive will use the SATA cable formerly employed by the optical drive.\nAs for tools, I believe you will only need a Phillips screwdriver (size #00 or #0, I can't recall). Unless they are required for the OptiBay, I don't think you'll need any Torx drivers. The installation instructions for the Data Doubler can be found here and cover the tools required for all MBP models. \nOne tip for doing this procedure - use a long roll of tape stuck to your desk to keep track of the screws you remove at every step. If you're especially concerned about losing track of where things go, you can put the tape on a piece of paper and write down the location of each screw next to where you've taped it.\nAll the standard warnings about opening your computer apply here.

I want the music to play in the movie through all the slides.\nThe music file is 5 mins long. It is set to play continuously per slide.\n\nA: I just wanted to say that I have exactly the same problem. My music file is 2:10 and in the exported movie it always stops after 1:04...

So after the Apple hack when celebrity nudes were stolen I changed my password to something more complex than I can easily remember. (My password is now stored in the password manager app and is something like this u7GhY53bAhh2x.)\nWhen I was buying this latest iPhone the sales rep at the Apple store assured me that I will no longer need to enter my password because the phone can read my fingerprint that is very secure, blah-blah-blah. So I set this all up and then what... now when I try to download a new app the thing pops up and wants me to enter my password. The praised fingerprint doesn't seem to do anything. So OK I entered my password (which now basically required a trip to the password manager program and a process of copying it letter-by-letter.) This was about a couple of weeks ago. Today, I was trying to write a review for another app and guess what -- that same annoying password window came up & wanted me to enter it again. So where is that fingerprint thing again?\nCan someone explain how to make it work with the fingerprint and not bug me with entering the password over and over again?\n\nA: Password is always needed for the first time after a restart, first time in the App Store etc, after that it will accept the fingerprint, so long as you have that switched on -  \nSettings > Touch ID… > [passcode] > use touchID for…\n\n\nA: The fingerprint is not a replacement for the password. It's a convenience feature to save some time. It's possible to create secure passwords you can easily remember. \nHere's an explanation:\nhttps://xkcd.com/936/\n", "Q: Office Word 2011 for Mac scrambles hyperlinks with different schemes I have a very urgent question.\nI made my dad buy a MacBook Air just 3 days ago, I configured it completely and installed Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, so far so good.\nThere is only one bad downside: Every Word document (.doc) which has hyperlinks with custom schemes (i.e: test://, whatever://) gets converted automatically to some weird file pointer scheme stuff. For example:\nExample 01: \"testing://onetwothree/\" -> \"file://localhost/testing/::onetwothree::\"\nExample 02: \"one://two/\" -> \"file://localhost/one/::two::\"\nHowever, using \"http://\", \"mailto://\", \"file://\" works with whatever you put after them.\nTypically, I'm looking for one simple solution: tell the Word not to validate the hyperlinks present on the document, whether the document is opened, saved, a hyperlink is created or edited, so they will not end up being converted/changed.\nPS: This behavior is not present on Windows Office (any version), only on Mac Office 2011.\nI have heard that Word Macros CAN overwrite the behavior for built-in function callbacks, something like VBA Scripts (correct me if I'm wrong).\nAny help?\n\nA: As for the 'weird' file pointed scheme, that's just what Office '11 does with non-standard URLs. It is actually attempting to create a link to file on the computer's filesystem.\nTo have Word not create such links, in Word go to the Preferences > AutoCorrect > AutoFormat as You Type tab and un-check \"Internet and network paths with hyperlinks\".\n", "Q: What info does a Mac broadcast and how to hide it? I want to run a Mac in the cloud as a webserver and for facilitative use. I've secured most of my used tools already, but I was wondering about the OS itself.\nImagine I'm running an up-to-date Yosemite. How could I check what information a third party could obtain from the device. If information could be found, how to hide it?\nI noticed some SSH services on Linux servers bluntly giving their exact OS version until the release number. I would want to prevent stuff like that being broadcasted and just wanted to double-check if OS X would broadcast such and how to obfuscate it or hide it fully. I can understand I can't hide my server is running OS X, but I would at least not like the external party to know more details if they were broadcasted.\n\nA: First make sure that you're running a firewall that is prohibiting all inbound and outbound connections on the server. Then open only those ports you need for the production to run fine.\nMost applications can be configured to not identify their exact version, but remember that this is not really giving you any more security, it is just a tad harder to exploit.\nAfter you've \"hardened\" your machine like this you could fire up a second machine in the same subnet and launch a utility like Wireshark (Wireshark download page) to listen to the chatter of your cloud server. This way you get additional hints about processes that you might want to silence.\n\nA: I second recommendation for \"Little Snitch\".\nIt's always running on my Mac.\nAt first, shocking to see much traffic from the OS itself.\nTo hide what you don't want revealed, you can set up rules in \"Little Snitch\".\nI also use \"Avast\" to control connections.\n", "Q: The App Store app update kept asking for Yahoo password I was trying to update YouTube on an iPhone 5S with iOS 7.0 but it asked me for Yahoo password, not iCloud password.\nHow am I supposed to solve this problem?\n\nA: The app store dialog that is titled \"Sign in to iTunes Store\" is worded slightly ambiguously.

When I play online I have a hard time limiting the amount of time I play. There is a free application I found called self-control. It allows you to block domains, ip addresses and ports to applications under what it calls a \"blacklist\" for a specified period of time. I entered into the blacklist the name of the poker website hoping its client side poker software connects through its main domain and even when self control program is blocking access, the program program still connects to its server. \nQuestion-Using terminal or some other utility how do I determine what servers or ports to block to prevent the poker software from connecting to its severs?\n\nA: There is\nlsof -i\n\nand \nnetstat -n\n\njust to name few of Terminal commands to look who is using the Internet.\nThose are information only, and will not block anything.\n\nA: Little Snitch is a program that blocks everything that you specifically doesn't allow. That way it is quite easy to keep track on all IPs and ports different programs are accessing. That way it's easy to use that information for Self-Control.\nhttp://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\n\nA: You can use the lsof command to figure out what IPs/ports are being accessed by a process, but first you'll have to figure out the process ID (PID) is for your poker software. You can use Activity Monitor (in the Utilities folder inside of Applications) to find out the PID. It should show up in the CPU tab, but if it doesn't, you can add it by right clicking in the column headers. One you have the PID, you can use the following command to see what IP connections are being used by the software (replace PID with the PID of the poker software:\nlsof -p PID | grep IPv4\n\n(It's possible, but unlikely the poker software is using IPv6, but you can tweak the command to check that, too.)\nIf the software creates lots of different connections at different times and then drops them, this may not work well, and Little Snitch would definitely help you out in that case (I totally recommend Little Snitch--it's awesome, but not free). In any event, if you block the persistent connections, it will most likely solve your issue.\n\nA: I use little snitch. You can monitor all incoming and outgoing connections and customise according to your requirements. Another alternative is HandsOff! however I haven't used this for sometime. \n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.10 doesnt recognize 1 and 3-finger gestures I have Macbook Pro 13\" 2014. Everything was working fine. But suddenly it stopped recognizing some gestures.\nI was always using built-in trackpad. But now my computer doesn't respond to tap or physical click. 3-finger gestures are not recognized as well.\nA few hours before this, the computer was working fine. Then I left my laptop open for about 40 min. When I returned, it looked like the mouse button was clicked and stuck in the clicked state (I don't have a mouse, it is just how it looked like). Of course, I tried to stop it, but nothing helped...

But it stops responding to clicks after that. Even when I log out, the clicks doesn't have any effect. I cannot login back!\nI believe this is not a hardware problem and I can fix it as soon as possible.\nBut how? I cleaned it, performed reboots, cannot reinstall OS though - simply cannot click \"next\"! \nOn the forums say that it might be a battery problem, but from the outside I don't see anything abnormal. And I cannot open the laptop and look at the battery.\nHow to make my laptop recognize clicks? Please, help me!\nUPD: I added a few details.\n\nA: One Queston, then my suggestion. \n\nWhen I connect a standard PC mouse, I get the same outcome - 2-finger\n  tap, zooming, swiping work. But not clicking.\n\nDid the machine respond normally to the mouse click?\n\nGiven your description of the issue, here’s how I would proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your software and firmware is up date. Apple Logo > About This Mac.. > Software Update\n\n*Disconnect all peripheral devices. Hold down Shift at the boot chime to enter Safe Mode. If you can’t recreate the problem, it’s software related. The most likely culprit would be a third party driver that's interfering with your trackpad functionality. \n\n*Run Apple Diagnostics on the machine. Do so two times, back to back, regardless of the result. The machine must be plugged into your MagSafe. If the machine is not plugged in, you may receive a false positive that there is an issue with your battery. If you do receive an error code, follow the on screen instructions. Make an appointment to bring your machine in for a definitive diagnosis and servicing. \n\n*Follow these instructions to reset the SMC. Components such as the keyboard lights, fans, battery, power supply, and trackpad all rely on this controller. If one is behaving abnormally, a reset may do the trick. See if the issue persists. If it still does, then proceed to reset the PRAM. \n\n*Make an appointment with Apple to bring the machine in for a free and definitive diagnosis. Remember, your machine is covered under warranty. The last thing you want to do is void that warranty. Especially when you can’t even pinpoint the problem. Simply unscrewing the bottom enclosure will void it if detected. So, do not try a DIY fix. Bring it in. If it’s a hardware problem, they’ll fix it free of charge. If it’s a software issue, they’ll proceed accordingly (see below) until the problem’s solved. No matter what the issue is, as long as it’s under warranty, they assume responsibility for fixing it until it’s fixed. I don’t mean to come off as preachy, but I can't stress this point enough. \n\n*I see no purpose in reinstalling OS X before diagnosing the issue. It’s the first step Apple will suggest to take after the hardware checks out. Not before.  However, if you do so, I’d recommend a clean install (wipe the machine completely, then selectively restore your data). \nBest of luck. \n\nA: I had the exact same problem, turned out to be a Bluetooth mouse connected, lying in a drawer with the mouse button pressed :)\n", "Q: How to either simultaneously delete photo from photo stream and all devices; or how to designate a photo not to go to the cloud at all.

I have a USB drive that was formatted for a Mac and now I want to use it for a PC. How can I do to make it?\n\nA: It’s quite simple. Note that reformatting the thumb drive will erase all it’s contents. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility. It’s located in the /Applications/Utilities folder. Or just type in “Disk Utility\" in Spotlight. \n\n*Select the drive (not the volume), and click the “Partition” tab.\n\n*Select “1 partition” from the drop down.

The standard nowadays is exFAT. It supports files of up to 16 exabytes in size. FAT32 only supports 4 GB files. Additionally, in a windows environment, the FAT32 filesystem is subject to more fragmentation. \n\n*If you want to use it exclusively on your PC, reformat it as NTFS in Windows on your PC (you can reformat as exFAT and FAT32 in Windows as well). An NTFS filesystem is read only in an OS X environment. OS X’s Disk Utility does not offer this as an option.\n\n*Others may suggest just to click the erase tab.

The big concern the phone vendors have is they don't want to wind up \"brokering\" complaints about real-time audio latency! Also they don't want to be seen as \"heavies\" coming in and wiping out the analog wireless mic market. The BIG latency problem on wifi for example is \"hidden latency\" from retries because unlike recorded media like CDs there is NO \"embedded error correction\", it's all retries (and it's not delays from bad firmware in the router, I looked into that too). What Apple WILL \"tolerate\" is transmission over AirPlay (they have a similar mechanism for files called AirDrop) but to use it you're required to connect BOTH wifi and Bluetooth and it's up to iOS to pick the one to use, they \"build in\" a giant 2 second real-time buffer (read 2 second real-time DELAY) which just means regardless of actual transmission issues the video and audio cross the finish line at the same time, their competition Chromecast is even LONGER (OK for streaming, bad for live). Raw Bluetooth latency isn't so bad but connectivity is an issue. So Apple \"addresses\" this by only pairing with \"passive\" Bluetooth devices (and maybe a speaker or two but certainly not a receiver). Android devices will \"pair\" OK but have you ever seen a Bluetooth mic app for Android, there isn't one! (Although to really get latency down you'd need a Nexus 5X or 6P or Pixel anyway.) There's also issues that between PC, iOS, Android no two of them use Bluetooth stacks from the same vendor which gives \"plausible deniability\".

This will restore the automatic backup of your database.\n\n\nIf you added music since your last sync, you'll probably have to add the music again, but this is way better than restoring and syncing your entire library.\n\nA: To find out why its not reading the music, first enable hidden files on your laptop, then look for hidden folder \"iPod_Control\" in the main directory of the iPod. All your music SHOULD be in there.\n", "Q: How to install MacPorts on user-only account? On my Mac I use an Admin and an everyday User account (without admin / sudo privileges). Currently I am setting up a new Yosemite system and found that after installing MacPorts (using its installer), I cannot do sudo operations, such as sudo port selfupdate. In the user account it tells me that it does not have sufficient privileges and on the admin account the command port is not found.\nSo I am wondering what is the correct way to set up MacPorts on OS X? Should I install it rather on the Admin instead of the User account? Or is there some other way to use it from the User account?\n\nA: Neither.\nMacports is installed as root and uses its own account macports for some things. It does not use your account for anything.\nTo do MacPorts actions e.g. install, selfupdate you need to run it as root. Which in this case is run via sudo. So to do these actions you do need an admin account.\nTo use MacPorts executables or libraries you just need to add MacPorts to your user environment, which is the same for any user on your machine. e.g. add /opt/local/bin to $PATH to put the executables on your path, as described in the MacPorts manual.\nThe one edge case is the install from the disk image which will run a script on your current user to add a line to your .bash_profile to set up your path.\nYou can also manually add the following line to your Admin's .bash_profile:\nexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\n\n", "Q: Why does updating Garageband 6.0.5 to 10 cost money? I have Garageband 6.0.5. Why does updating to Garageband 10 (next version, don't get fooled by numbers) cost money? I thought updates were free!\n\nA: When you bought garageband 6, you cannot update to the new version because it was released as a new program, not an update.\n", "Q: How can I send audio to airport speakers from a stereo system, not a computer? I have some speakers connected to an Airport Express, and can easily send audio to them from a computer. So far, so good. However, I also have an actual stereo system (receiver, CD/tape decks, etc.), and I'd like to be able to send the output from that system to the Airport speakers as well. \nI could probably do this by attaching a computer to the system, but it seems like overkill, and makes for a complex process (something like 'start computer, set up audio output', rather than 'push the button'). Is there some other, simpler piece of equipment that can take an audio input and send it to the Airport-connected speakers on my network?\n\nA: You have to have a computer in-between.\nIt probably could be something small like Arduino but it has to be able to communicate with Airport Express in expected way and compress your audio source on the fly to feed to Airport Express as bits and not analog waveform. There is no such device in commercial production as far as I know or if there are they take a great care not to advertise the ability). For example pretty expensive Lynn Network Music players say nothing about Airport Express in their promo materials.\nMaybe just maybe every AirPlay compatible receiver can do this but I am not sure since I don't have much experience with them. For this it should be able to get audio from its line in and play it over AirPort Express, maybe doing decoding to the expected format in the process.\nStill you might use old computer (you might try old G4 like Mac Mini or iBook might be enough but don't take my word for it test it first), setup audio streaming server on it, get audio from line in and encode it at highest settings it can (preferably lossless in iTunes friendly format since why else?). Then get iTunes to connect to the stream and play it over AE.\nThen if you are not using AE with external DAC you should if you care about sound quality since DAC integrated in AE is pretty well crappy one. AE supports Toslink connection.\n", "Q: Open iMovie '09 .rcproject in iMovie 10 I have a vintage 2009 iMovie project (.rcproject) I rescued from an old Time Machine backup, and I'm trying to open it in iMovie 10 under Yosemite. It's large enough that I'm pretty sure it does actually have the video in it.\nUnfortunately there's no just \"open a file\" option and everything I can find on line about the '09 -> 10 transition is about upgrading your iMovie \"library\". I haven't got a library, just one .rcproject file. How do I convince iMovie 10 this is something it can upgrade / open?\n(Additional info: I do have iMovie 9.0.9 on this machine, but under Yosemite it refuses to launch.)\n\nA: In iMovie 09 an RCProject file is a binary text file which contains instructions and references to the actual video material. The actual video clips are stored in an Event folder. Check to see if you still have your Event folders. The clips would be in there.\nYou mention that your RCProject file is large. This probably means that you rendered your finished movies. iMovie saved the \"Media Browser\" copy in the rcproject file so it doesn't have to render it again unless you make a change.\nSo open your RCProject file and navigate to the Movies folder. Any completed movies would be in there.\nTo open the RCProject, right click on it in the Finder and select SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS.\nOne more thing: If you do find the Event folder to go with the RCProject folder, iMovie is finicky about where these files are located.\nPut the RCProject file in the Movies/iMovie Projects/ folder.\nPut the Event in the Movies/iMovie Events/ folder.\nWith these in place, there is a chance that iMovie 10 will see them. However, I am not sure if you have to convert to iMovie 11 (which is version 9) first. Both iMovie 9 and iMovie 11 use the RCProject format. The current iMovie is called iMovie (no year) and is Version 10. It uses a scheme more like Final Cut Pro, so everything is in an Event folder, including any projects relating to that event.\n", "Q: Backup apps in ipa format on iphone no PC I need to restore my iphone firmware on my work computer, without installing any other program other than the iTunes already installed on it. I'm wondering if there's some kind if app or jailbreak tweak I can install on the iphone  and use to back up all my apps into ipa, copy to PC, then install later again.( I could always use appcake to install back ) \n\nA: Techicnally, what you want isn't impossible, but is pretty hard. I'd SSH in via your work computer, and copy applications from /var/mobile/Applications/. (/var/movile/Container/Applications/ in iOS 8). And, even that doesn't restore all your data.\n", "Q: How do I clone my old mac to a new one? I have a MacBook Pro running Lion 10.7.5.  I just got a new mac running Yosemite. I have everything from the old mac backed-up on Time Machine. How do I transfer all my files, apps, email, photos in iPhoto, music, etc., to the new mac? I want to get everything I have on my old mac, plus anything new on the new mac, such as new apps.\nWill the old Lion OS get installed on the new mac when I use the migration tool? I do not want that!\n\nA: If you haven't set up the new machine yet, you can do this by connecting your Time Machine drive before booting. (If the backup is on a Time Capsule, it will search for backups on it.) During the setup of the new machine, you'll be presented with the option of migrating your setup from the Time Machine backup.\nIf you've already configured the new Mac, use the Migration Assistant (Applications->Utilities) to do the same; or reboot into Recovery Mode to restore from the Time Machine backup. I'd actually do a full system reinstall and migration from the Time Machine backup in Recovery Mode to prevent any issues.\n", "Q: No java installations was detected, although I have Java $ java -version\njava version \"1.6.0_65\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode)\n\n$ which java\n/usr/bin/java\n\n$ ls /usr/libexec/java_home\n/usr/libexec/java_home\n\nBut when I run some application from the terminal, is says in terminal:\nNo java installations was detected.\nPlease go to http://www.java.com/getjava/ and download\n\n\nA: I had such problem in sbt run having $GREP_OPTIONS=--color=always --ignore-case.

Both the Mac and the iPhone are configured to sync to my iCloud account.  How do I force them to sync now, one after the other, so I can make this call?\n\nA: To summarize, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close and reopen the Contacts application. Did that work?\n\n\nSide Note: Generally contacts will sync whether the app is open or closed, it doesn't matter, but sometimes devices act up. It tends to happen with older devices, especially if running newer versions of iOS (iOS 8). \n\n\n*Try switching the Contacts tab under iCloud settings on your iPhone. If that does not work, check if that number is visible in iCloud.com\n\n*If the phone number is not there, it might be one of two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Your Mac is not uploading to iCloud.\n\n*You might have added that contact under the contacts of a different email account setup on your Mac. \n\n\n*Check your iCloud settings on your Mac and open the Contacts app, taking note if the contact is under the iCloud account by selecting the iCloud account alone, NOT \"All Contacts\". You will see different accounts (emails) on the left hand side if you allowed contact syncing for email accounts on the Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*If so, drag-and-drop the contact to the iCloud tab.\n\n\n*To confirm whether your Mac is uploading to the cloud, login to iCloud.com and check the Contacts app.  If you don't see the new contact, you know to focus on the Mac to iCloud sync.\n\n\nA: The real simple way to force Contacts to be updated is to add a new contact.  I add a new contact with a First Name of \"A\" and click done.  My contacts are then updated from the cloud.  Then I delete the new contact.\n**It works both ways - iPhone to Contacts and vice versa.\n\nA: Great way to force a sync is to go to iCloud settings and sign completely out and then sign back in - it forces a complete sync and solved my problem with this issue.\n\nA: I had this issue on the Mac side (icloud.com and iPhone were in sync). The accepted answer (open/close contacts.app) did not work in my setup (OS X 10.13.2). Nor did a reboot or checking/unchecking \"Contacts\" under iCloud in System Preferences.\nWhat did work, however, was signing out of iCloud on my mac, letting it remove local copies of everything, and signing back in. This is a nuclear option as it requires re-syncing, downloading multiple gigabytes of iCloud data in the process. You MUST ensure what's in iCloud (icloud.com) is the version of truth you want before proceeding down this road.\nBut it did work.\n\nA: I assume it's a little late for your phone call, but for anyone else with this problem you can force both the OS X and iOS Contacts apps to sync with different methods.\nOS X\nClose (and reopen?) the Contacts app.\niOS (8)\nTouch Groups on the top left, then drag down until the spinner at the top fills up.\n\nA: If you have multiple accounts on your phone such as your iCloud account as well as your work account it is possible that the new contact has been added to the wrong account.\nGo to Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars and scroll down about 2/3 of the way to the Contacts section and make sure that iCloud is the Default Account.\n\nIf you find that you have been saving contacts to the wrong account there currently appears to be no way to move them to another account using the iOS device. The best way to fix this is to either export them from one account and import them to the correct account then delete from the original (wrong) account. You can also accomplish this via emailing them to yourself from the iOS device.\n\nA: Reboot your iPhone. iCloud contacts started syncing immediately for me. It might work for you.\n\nA: Solution: 1) Default account on all devices needs to be iCloud. 2) You can select all of your contacts in OS X and drag them to \"iCloud > All iCloud\" in Mac OS X Contacts to get them all into the proper account (and thus syncing and showing up on your iOS devices). Apple will even handle the duplicates for you automatically.\n\nA: The iCloud contacts disappeared from my iPhone 6 for no reason. These iCloud contacts were still on the iCloud website, iPad, and mac, but they were not on the iPhone. I tried everything apple suggests on their website several times (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204150), but nothing worked. \nThen I tried turning on Gmail contacts from anther account and magically, the iCloud contacts synced. Why knows why that worked, but it worked for me.\n\nA: You can also try to click the circle / arrow thing in the upper left corner in the Contacts app.\n", "Q: Airport Extreme and 10/100 Ethernet Switch I have an Airport Extreme (with Gigabit Ethernet) connected up to my cable modem, my Mac, and my PC.  I have one spare port on the AE and thought about hooking up a spare 10/100 Ethernet Switch I have (D-Link DES-1105).  I could hook up the Blu-ray player, etc, to this.\nWill hooking up a switch like this (and 10/100 Ethernet devices to that switch) drop the Gigabit Ethernet on the rest of the AE to 10/100?  Or, will the AE keep the Gigabit devices running at full speed, and keep the 10/100 Switch running at 10 or 100 Mb/s?\n\nA: Auto-negotiating switches, like the one in the AE, will run each port at the speed of it's connection. I think you have to go back to the days of hubs to run into the \"port drag-down\" issue with one slow device bringing everything connected to the lowest connection speed.\n", "Q: Will Home Sharing work without a running iTunes instance? This is the idea: if I move my iTunes library to a NAS and enable Home Sharing, will this feature continue to work if I then turn off my PC?\nI would like my Apple TV to access my music and videos but without having to keep my PC running, ideally only the NAS should be running. Is there any way this could work?\n\nA: No. Home Sharing uses mDNS (Bonjour) to advertise. Without a running iTunes instance for the share, it won't be available. Your NAS may have a DNLA server built-in which could make the iTunes library on it available though.\n", "Q: how to Quick Look text files with custom file extensions in Finder When I have .txt files or .py files, I can Quick Look those files in Finder.

I've recently started reading up on RAM disks, and they really do sound like they could boost a computer's speed. However, I was wondering if there was a way to go even further and make a RAM disk one of the volumes in a DIY Fusion Drive. Is there a way, keeping in mind the fact that RAM loses its data upon losing power, to safely make a DIY Fusion Drive featuring a RAM disk?\n\nA: Fusion Drive acts as an extension to the installed HD, it is not a cache. If you would use a RAM disk as the SSD part for your DIY Fusion Drive you would loose the data stored in the RAM part whenever the system shuts down.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve files from a Time Machine backup done with Snow Leopard when my current OS is Mavericks? I have a Seagate GoFlex home 2 Tb external drive that was installed on my Snow Leopard Mac and configurer with Time Machine. A year ago, due to issues with my Mac, the (internal) hard drive was erased and I subsequently installed Mavericks and re-configured Time Machine with the external drive. I would like to retrieve the files from the Snow Leopard backups, which included many photos for example but I am unable to see them in Time Machine. I can only see the Mavericks backups. Here are additional things I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried accessing the external drive via Finder but nothing appears in the Time Machine backup folder. I obviously also looked in the other folders and for hidden files but nothing relevant appears. \n\n*I looked at the Seagate GoFlex applications that were included with the drive but none of them allow me to access the backups, including the Mavericks backups.\n\n*I tried the Migration Assistant (under Utilities) and I can only see the Mavericks backups.\n\n*I checked my Time Machine settings and \"tell me when old backups are deleted\" is enabled. I would have been noticed (which isn't the case). I also read that new backups can override older ones but my disk still has 1.5 Tb free. \n\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: The Time Machine backup format is OS-version agnostic. It doesn't care which version of the OS created the backup or which version is trying to access it.\nIt does care which machine is accessing the data. As far as TM is concerned, erasing your internal drive turned it into a \"new\" disk volume. The stuff it backed up before the erasure and the stuff it backed up after the erasure are backups of different disks and have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. That's why when you're browsing the backup of your current disk you can't see further back than when it was created.\nThis can be fixed, but only if you are mistaken when you say I tried accessing the external drive via Finder but nothing appears in the Time Machine backup folder. This can't be right. Your Mavericks backups, which you say exist, should show up in Finder.\nIf you look on your backup volume, you should see a folder named Backups.backupdb. Inside that is a folder for every computer you are backing up there. I'll assume there's only one. Inside that folder are a bunch of folders, almost all of them snapshots named according to when they were taken, in the format YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS. There will also be an alias name \"Later\" and maybe a few other folders. If that isn't what you see, I don't know how to help you.\nOpen TM and see how far back in time you can go. Make a note of that date and time. Exit Time Machine.\nIn Finder, browse through the list of snapshots to find the latest one from before that oldest Mavericks backup. That was the last snapshot taken from before you erased the disk. If there isn't one, if the oldest snapshot is one you can reach with Time Machine, you're out of luck. You must have erased your TM backup when you set up TM to start backing up the new disk, and your old data is gone.\nBut if you can find such a pre-erasure snapshot, we can re-associate it with the new disk. That is, we can make TM treat it as a backup of your current boot disk.\nTo do that, log into your admin account and open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities). Enter the command\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a / \n\nbut don't press return yet. Be sure you left a space after the slash. Open up that pre-erasure snapshot, and you will see a folder for each disk you were backing up at that time. (There's probably only one: your boot volume. That's the one we want.) Drag that folder (the one for the snapshot of your boot volume) to the Terminal window. Drop it anywhere; Terminal will put it in the right place.\nPress return. If you've never used sudo before, you'll get a scary warning message, which you should read but ignore. You'll be prompted for your admin password, which you need to type blind. Nothing will be echoed to the screen. Press return at the end of the password.\nTime Machine should now be able to browse backwards across the erasure.\n", "Q: One user can't open anything after Yosemite upgrade My Mac mini (early 2009) was getting slow, so I decided to do some upgrades. I got 8 GB of ram and a 128 GB SSD from crucial that their wizard verified as being compatible. I downloaded Yosemite from the app store and made a bootable USB drive following Apple's instructions. Then I did a time machine backup to an external drive. Finally I did the RAM and SSD install. I inserted the Yosemite USB drive I made earlier and did a fresh installation. On startup, I migrated files and settings from my time machine backup. I logged in to my primary account and did the software updates from the app store and rebooted. At this point my family started using the computer and is very happy with it. Startup, login, and application loads are very fast. There's no more freezes or beachballs.  \nHowever, one of the four user accounts is problematic. It takes several minutes to login and load the dock/ menu bar, versus seconds for all the other accounts. Clicking on anything in the menus/desktop/dock/dialogs results in a beachball for several minutes. No applications or files will open. Occasionally I'll get a \"the application ... could not be opened\" error dialog 10-20 minutes after trying to open something from the dock. How do I fix this account?  \nSome additional information: this computer does not have filevault encryption enabled, and there are no login items. \n\nA: There is likely a corrupt preferences or other file in the user's ~/Library folder. Honestly your best bet is to create another users folder for that person, copy their files over and set up Mail, Messages, Safari and the like from scratch.\nOnce you have a working profile you can slowly migrate other things from the old to the new user folder (old Mail folders, Safari bookmarks, etc.) till you have enough restored for everything to work as necessary.\nAt that point you can delete the old user.\n\nA: Use/hold Command-R during restart\nselect Terminal and type \"resetpassword\"\nThen select reset password for the account in question\nDO NOT RESET the Password.\nInstead click on the Reset Home Folder Permissions.\n\n\nA: So. I've had this same problem with multiple machines. \nI've tried all these fixes.

Thing is, Bluetooth doesn't show up under device manager. In fact, I install the following three drivers from the Boot Camp support package (version 4.0.4033), and the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleBluetoothBroadcomInstaller - success, driver being used\n\n*AppleBluetoothEnablerInstaller - success, driver being used\n\n*AppleBluetoothInstaller - success, but \"Not needed (no device for\nupdate present)\"\nThe last part is the worrying bit. There's no yellow triangle in Device Manager. There's just plain nothing. No device that does Bluetooth at all. I tried the broadcom drivers (  http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php) and it won't detect any device, it just gives up before installing anything. I tried WIDCOMM (http://www.drivers-win.com/acer/acer-aspire-5740-windows-7-drivers/), and it also gives up, not able to detect anything. I looked at the Broadcom adapter under Network Adapters in Device Manager and enabled Bluetooth Collaboration, still nothing. I've even reset the SMC and tried everything again. Nothing at all.\nI would think this was a heavier issue (i.e. the Bluetooth is fried on the machine), but my headphones work like a charm when I switch back to Lion. Does anyone know what could be the issue, and whether I could fix it without reinstalling Windows?\nMaybe I'm installing the wrong support package...how can I check my Mac's actual model?\n\nThis is what Device Manager looks like...as you can see, Apple Built-In Bluetooth is nowhere to be found\n\nA: It seems this has to do with your older macbook pro because I have a more recent iMac and my Bootcamp version shows Bluetooth devices. When did you download that version of Bootcamp? If you're still using the original version from years ago, you may want to try downloading a new version as it may include the Bluetooth capability. If not, your computer may just be too old. Hope this helps, good luck!\n", "Q: Is it okay to run two instances of SuperDuper! at once? It's quite easy to start two instances of any app from the command line. In this case:\nopen -n /Applications/SuperDuper\\!.app\n\nHowever, I know that this isn't always a good idea because most applications are not meant to share resources with themselves. I was hoping to back up two different drives with SuperDuper! (a hard drive cloning application) at the same time. I was wondering if this is safe.\n\nA: A better question is \"can I back up two different drives at the same time?\"\nIf you have 4 drives total, on 4 different connections, then yes. To be clear, there must be 4 physically separate storage devices involved, not just separate volumes. And \"4 connections\" does not include daisy-chained firewire devices or plugged into the same usb hub (those count as one connection).\nRunning 2 copy jobs on the same volume is a huge performance hit - drives have but one read/write head so the absolute best you can do is 2x sequential-copy speed. In reality it will be much worse as the heads are constantly going back and forth between the two copy jobs.\nRunning data down the same wire will similarly eliminate any advantage you gain by running two processes. \nThe one exception to the rule is network copies - downloading several files over the internet (different servers) works because your external network connection is so much slower than the internal connections that they never get saturated.\n", "Q: Do I need to \"unregister\" an OSX virtual machine? I have an OSX VM (using VMWare fusion 6), and want to delete it.\nVMWare's docs say \"Apple's updated license agreement allows you to install up to two additional copies of Lion on your Mac which is already running a retail version of Lion\"\nI remember something in the installation, possibly linking to my Apple ID saying that I could only install 1-2 copies in a VM too (I installed Mavericks, 10.9)\nIf I'm going to delete this VM, and want to create other OSX VMs in the future, can I/do I need to \"unregister\" this VM?\n\nA: There's no registration for OS X, and nothing in the code to detect and prevent you running more than two VMs. It's purely a legal restriction. If you've deleted the VM, then you're fine.\n", "Q: Quickly remove badge from app Is it possible to quickly remove a notification badge from an app in the Dock? I'm looking for a solution faster than opening the app itself and performing whatever task is required to mark the notification as read.\nIn some apps, clearing the badge is quick and easy, but others require a bit more persuasion or actual action. For example, the App Store badge is useful as it tells me that updates are available, but once I'm aware of this, I don't need the badge any more. Unfortunately, clearing the badge requires installing/ignoring the updates, which I may not want to do immediately. A quick way to remove just the badge would be very useful.\nI would prefer something scriptable, but GUI scripting is not out of the scope.\n\nA: I'm not aware of anything available to remove the badge from the app. However is is simple enough to turn off the notifications. For example in Mail:\n\nNote the checkmark next to Badge App Icons in Notifications -> Mail. That will prevent the badge icon and if you have the sound on you will be notified when a new message comes in without the annoying visual distraction of the badge.\n\nA: The badges populate when certain conditions are met.\nIn most cases an action needs to be performed before the badge is removed/updated.\nBadges can be cleared easily if the developer who wrote the app adds an optional action to ignore the current conditions and clear the badge. Acting like a kind of reset.  \nSo you are limited to the developers actions or using the apple supplied disable badge in the notifications settings.\n\nA: In general, it depends heavily upon the App in question. \nOS X Mail for instance has the ability to select one folder for the dock count. It also has hooks that allow a third party developer to heavily customize the dock icon for Mail app based on multiple criteria.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.creativeinaustria.com/DockStar\n\n", "Q: When I want to install TeamViewer 10, why can't I select my system disk as the destination?

The photos and videos were in the DCIM folder. \n!\n\nA: Since you cannot unlock your iPad, you wont be able to backup your device using iTunes. When you have iCloud backup enabled for your iPad, it will automatically make a backup when you plug in the power cable.

Why does  \"my music\" in ITunes have multiples of the songs I have loaded?\nHow do I get rid of the duplicates without manually deleting each one?\n\nA: There are many variables that could affect the outcome you have proposed. You could have downloaded physical CD's while offline years ago and then online recently, changed Apple IDs, shared an Apple ID etc etc. Theres really no telling. If the music is from the iTunes store that you downloaded it could just simply be an iCloud issue or a iTunes Match issue etc etc. I would suggest you don't go Apples route if you have a large library of duplicates because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It only searches for duplicate 'Song Titles'\n\n*They have to be manually deleted\n\n*There is no filter option after you click 'Show Duplicates' other than 'Same Album'\n\n\nHowever,\nThis is the way Apple has offered:\nGo to your iTunes and in the menu bar click 'View' and in the drop down menu select 'Show Duplicates' or 'Show Duplicate Items' (based on your iTunes version)\nThis will generate a new table view of nothing but duplicate Song Titles. As mentioned above, it only narrows it down to that and you have to manually delete them. However, the only other filter option you have is the 'Same Album' tab which segregates only the Song Titles that repeat within the same Album Title. See picture:\n\nIf this isn't as flexible as you like, there are Apps out there can decipher it better than Apple has provided, but i will not post links to those softwares to remain objective and not sound like I am sponsoring them. \n\nA: In your case, I cannot tell.

The fan was pretty loud and iStat showed 99 degrees. However, as soon as I've terminated the process hogging the cpu, it went down to 80s in a second which means iStat readings might be inaccurate..\nSo, my question is, might this have damaged my computer somehow?\nThanks in advance.  \n\nA: Your Mac and Intel CPU have means of protecting them self from self destruction.\nYou Mac has thermal senors (same one that the istat uses) to monitor temperature and do something about it.\nThe Intel CPU has also a build in circuit to shut down before any damage is done due to overload or heat.\nSo no, no damage has been done in that short period.\nHowever, running at elevate temperatures for extended time (days) will eventually reduce the life time of the CPU, by creating junction leakages and interconnect issues, that is why there is a build in circuit (inside the CPU) to stop that.\nCredentials: I am a CPU design engineer.\nPS\nYou Mac does not need iStat, that one is only for you to feel better, or not.\n", "Q: Cant allow app to control computer anymore I'm developing app now, and when I debug it - I open debug folder and drag app into Preferences->Privacy->Accessibility->List.

A couple I know have two computers I'm supporting - one is a iMac which I recently upgraded from Snow Leopard (10.6) to Yosemite (10.10).  The printer is attached to this machine.  The other computer, unfortunately, is a 450MHz Power Mac G4 (AGP graphics) running the last version of Panther (10.3.9).  Surprisingly, the 14-year-old computer still works and is actively being used (primarily for AppleWorks documents, which is another \"ugh\").\nBefore the iMac was upgraded, I had done something to it which let the Power Mac see the shared printer.  I suspect it had to do with CUPS, but I could be wrong.  Ever since the upgrade to Yosemite, the Power Mac has been unable to print, and I can't seem to recreate the old setup.\nMy question resumed in one sentence is:\nHow do I share a printer from a Mac running Yosemite to one running Panther, so that the Panther one can print? \n\nA: For clarity I will name your Power Mac G4 running Panther: Pant and your iMac running Yosemite: Yose.\nYosemite has problem to print in an IPv4 environment (see: How to make shared printing works on Yosemite within an IPv4 only network?.\nOn the other hand Panther is able to run IPv6.\nCheck IPv6\nHence the 1rst point to check to be able to print from Pant is that Ipv6 is up and running. If Pant and Yose are connected through Ethernet, you will check this with (this is a command to enter within Terminal):\nifconfig en0\n\nand you should get an output containing a line starting as:\ninet6 fe80::\n\nWhich prooves that Pant has an IPv6 address and is IPv6 connected.\nIf they are connected through AirPort, you have to check the same output with:\nifconfig en1\n\nIf Pant doesn't have an IPv6 address, you will have to modify its network configuration through:\nSystem Preferences > Network\n\nselect Advanced...\nand under the TCP/IP window, select\nConfigure IPv6: Automatically\n\nClick OK, Apply.\nCheck that IPv6 is now up and running.\nCheck cupsd\nIf you just enabled IPv6 for the 1st time on Pant then you will have to restart cupsd so that it will be able to talk this protocol.\nThe easiest way is to simply restart Pant.

I need help. so the photos from my iPhone 5S, when connected to the iMac, will automatically sync and the photos from my iPhone 5S can be seen on the iPhoto on iMac. how do I stop this ? I don't want anyone to check my photos when using yhe iMac. I want privacy.  I want to set a lock on the iPhone to prevent the pictures from being synced and connected to iPhoto.\n\nA: Firstly, you can't prevent your iPhone from doing things on the user end of tasks. Thats the user's job. Secondly if your concern is privacy, automatic sync to iPhoto is the lesser of your worries. iCloud automatically syncs your photos to the cloud which can be seen from any device using your apple ID. If your computer is a publicly used computer a specific password protected login account would be a better fit for you.  \nRegardless, to answer your question is a quick and easy method. Go to your spotlight search and type Image Capture or you can find the application in your 'Applications' folder. \nWhen the device is plugged in you will see its title populate in the left sidebar. Click on it. This is what your screen will now show:\n\nYou may or may not see the bottom bar, if not just expand it to show more options and your screen will now look like this:\n\nSimply change your method to No Applications. Alternatively, this can be done within iPhoto preferences, however, I just wanted to point this option out to you for future references.\n", "Q: How do you enter binary numbers in OS X Calculator?

I moved the \"iTunes\" folder to my external and I also moved my Music folder which is also outside of my external but the issue I'm having is when I export the XML file.\nIn Itunes I went to File > Library > Export Library which exports an XML file.\nIn the XML file I see a ton of paths that begin with:\nfile:///Volumes/Data/Music/\n\nSo my plan is to change all the files from beginning with that to:\nfile:///External/Music/\n\nThat way iTunes can find my files. I haven't done the last step yet because when I option+click the itunes file and it opens up to the message with an option to \"Choose Library...\" when I click this option it won't let me select the XML file I just exported but an ITL file in the\niTunes/Previous iTunes Libraries/\n\nfolder where there are some files with the extension ITL and some that dont have an extension at all.\nHow do I move my files from my self managed Music folder on my hard drive to a Music folder on my external?\n\nA: Leave the iTunes folder where it is, or symlink it from there. It's relatively small compared to the actual music data, but iTunes really wants to find it in the default location. \nThe simplest way to do this would actually be to change the library location then let iTunes organise it for you… however, if you don't do that you will have to change one file, then Import it. iTunes will not simply find your changed file & say to itself, 'hmm, I see, they're all here now.'\nYour premise is almost correct, however, you don't export the XML, you change the existing one.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've already moved the main ~/Music/iTunes folder structure put it back (or Symlink it) & check all is still OK in iTunes.\n\n*Quit iTunes.\n\n*Copy the iTunes Library.xml & .itl files to the desktop for safety.\nDelete the ITL still in the iTunes folder. iTunes will rebuild this itself at the last step.\nOpen the XML in BBEdit or similar.\n\n*Change the paths, as you were doing - you already noticed that these are, rather irritatingly, absolute paths not relative.\n\n*Now - this is the important bit that none of the 'moving my iTunes Library' guides tell you. They mostly tell you to Import this new XML from the Import menu - I've done it, it can take 12 hours & you lose some data.\n\n*Save your modified XML file back into the iTunes Music folder.\nWe now need to make a new broken ITL file.\n\n*Open Terminal & enter this touch ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty ITL file, broken enough for this.\n\n*Launch iTunes. It will now notice something is 'wrong' & start rebuilding the ITL file, using your newly-modified XML file. The message is 'Importing ‘iTunes Music Library.xml’  This will take some time, but more like 15 minutes than 8 hours.\nYou may find some album artwork missing - it never seems to be a truly perfect solution, but your play counts, playlists etc should all survive intact.\n", "Q: Account for upgrade is different to account in phone settings My father-in-law had forgot his Apple ID on his iPhone. He had his friend enter his details to download some apps on to his phone. He's since reset his password and set his phone back to his own account (both the iTunes and iCloud are using his email address). The issue is, when he goes to upgrade some apps it's asking for the password for his friend's email account? How can we resolve this?\n\nA: NRaf,\nChances are the friend downloaded those apps under his/her Apple ID. Thats why it's prompting that Apple ID username/password.\nSimply delete those apps and reinstall them under your Dads account and everything will be fine. \nIf these are Apps that your friend has paid for but your dad has not and thats why the friend downloaded them to his device so your dad wouldn't have to pay for them, then thats a different issue. look into family sharing and see whats going on there from both parties.\n", "Q: Is there any way to connect a record player (RCA outputs) to AirPlay speakers? I've got a very simple situation, which is: I have a generic record player with a preamp and RCA outputs (red/white). I have a pair of speakers connected to an old Airport Express, one connected to a new Airport Express, and an Apple TV.\nCan I make the record player Do A Sound in the AirPlay-connected speakers? Options I've considered are:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Raspberry Pi, but the software side of it may be more trouble than it's worth\n\n*Connecting the record player, using an adapter, to my iMac, and then using Rogue Amoeba's LineIn to capture input, and transmit all audio, using Soundflower and Porthole, to AirPlay. This worked, but the lag between different speakers is considerable. Also, I'm using three separate apps for a task I should be able to do with a small box.\n\n\nThis doesn't seem like that maddeningly difficult an ask, but so far I've come up with nothing that works as an AirPlay transmitter in the same way as, say, iTunes. I can get this amp for cheap: http://www.pioneer.eu/uk/products/42/98/405/VSX-529-K/page.html but I don't understand if it can transmit as well as receive AirPlay streams. Halp?\n\nA: Now I have figured out a simple and reasonably cheap solution for Airplay that does not require a computer, paid apps and similar, only a cable, that have multiple other uses, and an iOS device not in use while listening (depending on the circumstances I use either my iPhone or my iPad), see this\nhttp://davidbo.livejournal.com/795.html (It is added to the Wayback Machine so it won't disappear).\nSome non-dealbreaking minor issues remains, I will update that article when I find solutions to them.\n\nA: If you want to improve audio quality you need a some kind of optical receiver on the end of AE. It could be MD player/recorder as a cheap solution. Or audio receiver/amplifier as not cheap but better and versatile. You connect it with miniToslink to Toslink cable and then you get signal from and sending it where and how you want. This way you are omitting AE DAC which is considerable boost to quality. Still you can worse it with speakers amp if they are standalone multimedia speakers so you might not hear the difference.\nIs it what you were trying to achieve with this cumbersome loops btw?\n\nA: Look at this http://www.yankodesign.com/2012/06/28/vinyl-goes-wireless/\nApparently it has a DLNA/Airplay module. If that module was possibly to buy separately I guess it would solve your (and my) problem, but so far, I haven't found anything.

I read that it would be \"preferable\" to set this up because of the security flaw which still has not been addressed, but that's another issue).\nWhen I login, I first have to login with my admin account & password.\nThen another screen comes up with both the admin account and the standard account and a black rectangular shape at the left-hand side of the bottom the page which tells me to login. A white rectangle outline is on both the standard account image and the password section. I then enter my apple ID password into that white outlined rectangle. This is how I get into my computer.\n(I had many many other problems from Yosemite which I have remedied slowly)\nBUT the problem is:\nI have locked myself out of the admin account somehow.\nThe admin password I login with, does not work anywhere else. For instance it does not unlock anything that requires to unlock the padlock - such as System Preferences.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot access Disk Utility, cannot unlock or put in my admin password.\n\n*I cannot turn FileVault off or the Firewall\n\n*I cannot upgrade software that requires admin password.\n\n\nWhat can I do to regain admin access? (I cannot do this in System Preferences because I am locked out). Do I have to reset my default keychain?\nWhat do I need to do?\n\nA: First, setting up separate admin and standard accounts was NOT a mistake. It is, in fact, a Good Idea™.\nWhen you need to authenticate (for example, to unlock a padlock), you need to enter both your admin name and your admin password. If you're in your admin account, the name will be filled in for you. If you're in your standard account, both the name and password fields will be blank, and you need to enter them both. Be sure to enter the admin's name and the admin's password.\n\nA: You can reset the admin (or any) password by using the Recovery HD partition (assuming you're on a newer Mac).  \nRestart your computer and hold down \"R\" key or \"option-r\" (if standard \"r\" doesn't work).  This will start up the computer to the Recovery HD/Internet Recovery.\nOnce it is booted to the Recovery HD, select Terminal from the Utilities menu. \nOnce in Terminal, enter \"resetpassword\" and follow the prompts.\n", "Q: Fix iTunes Billing issue with iTunes code My prepaid MasterCard didn't have enough value so a problem occurred at my last purchase and I can't download any already purchased music or free updates anymore as I have to update my credit card information.

My iPad mini is jailbroken and I wish to use one to symlink apps to a USB flash drive because I only have a 16GB model and I'm always trying to find things to delete to free up space. Is it worth the money for an Apple branded adapter?\n\nA: The reason the adapters from apple have such a high price is because the product have a chip inside that will make sure the product keeps working.

I've had some success, but am running into seemingly inconsistent and troublesome errors.  In order to diagnose the errors, I've broken the scripts down into their component parts and narrowed the most troublesome issue down to the Screen Saver.  When I activate the current screen saver via a script, or if I access the Screen Saver control panel via the System Preferences, I get \n\nI can click the \"OK\" button and it dismisses, sometimes for good, but most often it loops endlessly and my only option is to force a restart by holding down the power button.  I've tried force quitting all open apps, and relaunching the finder and the error message/dialog box loop remains running.  \nOddly, starting the Screen Saver with the Hot Corner does not seem to trigger the error.\nTo me this indicates that the issue isn't with my script, but that there's a problem with my Mac.\nFor what it's worth, I've also had issues with connecting to my Time Capsule backup which is the only drive on that server.\nThe machine is a MacBook 13-inch Late 2007 running OS 10.7.5.\nThoughts?\nUpdate - \nI thought that the Screen Saver might have been trying to call up images from a drive that used to be connected to the Airport Extreme but that is no longer there.  I reset the Screen Saver control panel to one of the built in Screen Savers (after many tries at dismissing the irksome dialog box) and I deleted my user defined Screen Savers.  This did not resolve or change the issue in any way.  I've tried the same AppleScript on two other Macs without incident.  Both of these other Macs are running 10.9.5 though, so that may or may not indicate anything.  \nIs there a way to re-install just the Screen Saver, or should I try to re-install the entire OS?  Is there something else I should try?\nThanks!\nUpdate 2\nWell, re-installing the OS did not resolve the issue.  I tried deleting the preferences plist from both the user library folder and the library folder at the top level of the hard drive.  This didn't resolve it either.  Perhaps it's an issue with the Airport Extreme, though I can't imagine why the Screen Saver in a re-installed OS would need to access the Airport Extreme.  I'm really stumped here and beginning to wonder if I'm going to have to pay for more expert help.  Thoughts?\nUpdate 3\nIt occurred to me that though the Screen Saver should not be trying to connect to some external volume, it still might be.  I used to have a number of hard drives connected to, and shared by the Airport Extreme.  One of those drives stopped mounting reliably, and as it so happens, it's the one with my pic archive and iPhoto files on it.  I took it to a local shop and they worked some low level UNIX magic on it and recovered my data to a new, larger drive.  This new drive is now connected to my RAID 1 server Mac Mini, not the Airport Extreme.  When I mount the volume with the pic archive to my desktop first, there is no error message.  Dismounting it and running the script or opening the Screen Saver control panel prompts the error message.  Help?  \n\nA: OK, I got it  solved.  I first mounted the disk with the image files from it's new, permanent location on the server.  Then I opened iPhoto and slowly, image by image opened them.  The bulk of them opened with no problem from the new location.  A fair number, 100 or so out of 10,000, had lost their connection to the actual file.  Most of these I was able to locate on the hard drive and re-link with no problem.  A few, perhaps 20, I seem to have lost completely.  None of them were of much importance.  I allowed iPhoto to take it's time quitting so that it could update it's library etc. Now, even without that drive mounted to my desktop, the Screen Saver will start with a simple AppleScript and opening the Screen Saver control panel works with no trouble and does not spawn any error messages at all. \n", "Q: Music App forgets what it was doing When resuming music playback after a break (10 minutes, few days, another app playing content) it ignores whatever playlist, album, artist or other refinement was placed on the music list and simply plays at random from the entire library.\nIs there a way to set it so that resuming playback will resume in the playlist it was last playing?  If the music app is opened directly, it remembers where it was, so why not when using the play button on the lock screen, or when attaching a Bluetooth device, or plugging it into a speaker?\nFor example, I was playing Christmas music on a speaker system at home.  I unplugged the iPod 5, went out to my car, automatically paired to the Apple compatible in dash Bluetooth and resumed playback.  It picked up where it left off in the same song it was playing, but showed the number of songs in the entire library (not the playlist) and shuffled to another song in the library after the current song, not in the previously loaded playlist.  I had to unlock the iPod, open the music app, return to the main screen, select playlists, select the desired playlist, select a song and then play.  That's a lot of steps to resume playing a music playlist on a music playing device (especially while driving).\nFor another example, I was listening to a playlist using the built in speaker of my iPod 5.  I took a phone call, so I swiped up and pressed pause.  While on the phone, I used another app, then set the iPod down.  After the phone call, I pressed the home button and simply pressed play on the lock screen.

Stuart H's suggestion points you in the right direction IMO.\nFunctionality I'd include in a boot time script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detect if one of the IOBluetoothFamily.kext or IO80211Family.kext drivers, located in /System/Library/Extensions/, pass code\nsignature validation (with Apple's codesign command line utility). If one or both of them do, they\nlikely have been updated/replaced by an OS X update and need to be re-patched: the script can proceed.\n\n*Rename any KextsBackupBeforePatch and KextsBackupAfterPatch folders in the user    dir to avoid any \"overwrite files\" prompt during the activation.\n\n*Run contitool.sh -a with admin privileges to activate Continuity from the command line. Catch and log CAT's output in a file: in case of failure you may want to know what happened.\nAdditionally, I'd modify the rebootPrompt() function of contitool.sh to restart the system automatically. You could also add a popup asking or warning the user about the reboot on top of that, e.g. through Apple Script (osascript command line utility).\nLast but not least: Apple may release an OS X update anytime that breaks the methods used by this tool to activate Continuity. So far this hasn't been the case - but risks of issues with your system are increased if you automate the activation right after an OS X update.\n", "Q: Automatic conversion between .ps to .pdf upon download onto Mac OSX? Is there any way to convert .ps to .pdf every time automatically as a .ps is downloaded onto a Mac machine? (Using Mountain Lion 10.8)\n\n\n*\n\n*can Automator perform this task?\n\n*convert and then delete the .ps\nIt's annoying that it has to convert from .ps to .pdf in preview every time I open the file, and quick preview doesn't work on .ps.\n\nA: You could use the Folder Action for that.\nRight click on to your download folder\nselect Folder Action Set up:\nChoose Covert PostScript to pdf action.\ndone\nIf you feel like modifying the script go ahead.\n\nA: You could set up Acrobat Distiller with a watched folder, or use Automator with it. This gives you better control over the conversion options, as you could specify the .joboptions.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro won't exit out of iPhotos I was importing pictures from my Nikon d3200, i had to stop it early, so i pressed the stop importing, and the delete the pictures that you have already imported, then I left. Now, it won't close out of iPhotos and it says it is importing photos, but it said that all day. Since it won't close out, i can't shut down my Mac or restart it. And I can't import the rest of my photos either. What should I do?\n\nA: There are two ways to exit an application that is stuck:\nHold alt+cmd+esc and then Force quit the application that is not responding.\nIf that did not work force shutdown the computer by holding the power button for 5 seconds or longer.\nIn both case you will lose all unsaved information.\n", "Q: After erasing 200 GB I need to repair it using the Recovery HD I was cleaning my MacBook Pro, erasing all unused files I had on it. After that I decided to erase the free space, so I will have all my files organized and cleaned the \"used space\". After that I verified the disk that shows the following error:\n\nThis disk needs to be repaired using the Recovery HD. Restart your computer, holding down the Command key and the R key until you see the Apple logo. When the OS X Utilities window appears, choose Disk Utility.\n\nThe questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*My mac will go from scratch, means erase all the programs, files, music, pictures etc?\n\n*What if I install Yosemite, will it solve my problems?\n\n*If number 2 doesn't solve the problem, are there any steps I should take now?\n\n\nI'm now backing up my MacBook on time machine, just in \"case\" I lose it all, and before I erased the free space all was fine!\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*No your Mac will not reset all you files. It is just maintenance of file system and not your files.\n\n*No it will probably not solve your problems. It even can make matters worse on filesystem level. Or just ask you to do the same i.e. Repair Partition.\n\n*You should just do what it you are asked — boot to Recovery HD with CMD + R on startup and Repair Main Partition.\n\n\nWord of caution: It might be that you HDD is failing so do Time Machine backup or other form of backup before going futher.\n\nA: Personally, I would steer clear of Yosemite for a few more months. Look at all the complaints about it in the App Store review section. I've never seen anything that negative before.\nYour disk could be failing, but it probably just lost some linked files. I use Scannerz to test my drive periodically because I'm paranoid, even with Time Machine in place. Testing the backup drive is, FWIW, probably more important than testing the regular drive because if the backup fails you're pretty much sunk.\nLike the other poster said, make sure all your Time Machine backups are up to date, then let the system go ahead and try to correct the index files. The errors you're showing aren't that serious but who knows. Better safe than sorry.\nIf sectors on a hard drive or blocks on an SSD go missing because of damage, indexing problems can happen, but I'm guessing maybe you just had the power go out on you once or twice or maybe the unit got shut down while a write operation was taking place. \nHopefully this won't be a big deal.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Strange networking issue: good software/hardware troubleshooting tools? I'm posting this question with the hope of getting some guidance from others because at this point I'm completely stumped.  \nI'm trying to troubleshoot a mid 2011 iMac (11,2) running Mavericks that is unable to ping or communicate with any other host, despite appearing to connect to my home router without issue (it associates and gets an IP address from DHCP).  The router is an Asus RT-N65U with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios.  Wireless clients mostly connect to the 2.4GHz radio since it has better range, WPA2 authentication is used on both.  There are numerous other devices on the LAN - both wired and wireless - that all work fine.  Furthermore, the iMac in question seems to only have developed problems within the last couple of days though nothing has changed on the router and nothing has changed on the machine either...or so I'm told.\nAfter some initial troubleshooting I went ahead and reinstalled Mavericks from a USB stick I had on-hand, figuring that would eliminate any software related issues that might have otherwise been hard to track down.  However the problem persisted even after the re-install, which made me think the wireless card was flaking out.  I'm skeptical of this however because\n\n\n*\n\n*The machine doesn't have any problem establishing a network connection\n\n*The signal strength is what I'd expect to see\n\n*I ran a packet sniffer and that showed link layer packets going back and forth, but IP packets of any kind are ignored (as far as I can tell).\n\n*I set up an ad-hoc network with the iMac and joined it with my MBP, both machines could ping each other.\n\n\nThe only thing I've seen that seems sort of suspect is an error message from the kernel in the wifi log: Unsupported ioctl 181 but I haven't been able to determine what this means beyond the kernel asking the wireless driver to do something it can't, so it may or may not be significant.  The other potentially significant thing is that at one point this machine was restored from a time machine backup of a completely different computer (a MBP).  It's my understanding that time machine backs up the entire drive, so restoring a backup from a different hardware configuration seems like it could break things, but nothing that a clean install of OSX couldn't fix.  I've tried to do the built in hardware test but it doesn't work for some reason, maybe because this machine has an after-market hard drive upgrade (the original failed).\nSo this brings me back to wondering whether it's a software issue, particularly something to do with the router but that seems strange since nothing has changed on the router and I'm the only one who could change anything to begin with.\nThis all brings me to my question: what else could I look into that could provide more info to work with so I narrow down what's going on here?\nUPDATE\nSome more info and clarification of some things:  When I say the machine \"connects\" to the router, I meant associate.  It associates to the wireless network, but will not ping the router's IP address.\nI have not tried a wired connection but I did try one of these and it works flawlessly, so this is specific to the built in wireless.  Are there any other tools for testing the hardware besides the Apple diagnostics?\n\nA: Apple ships with some pretty good tools to check wifi network.\nLook in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications for\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Utility.app\n\n*Wireless Diagnostics.app\n\n\nYou can also access them by holding Opt/Alt while clicking on the WiFi icon in the menu bar.\nThen there is lots of Terminal commands to do that as well, if you prefer the Terminal.\n", "Q: Using an iMac as a secondary monitor I have an early 2009 iMac (The last one that was 24 inches) and a Macbook Pro from work. Occasionally I work from home and would like to use my iMac as a second monitor with the Macbook.\nIs this possible? And what cable do I need? If not, I'm thinking of getting the new non-retina iMac, is it possible with that?\n\nA: As explained here, the first iMac to allow this is the 27-inch Late 2009 iMac.\nThere are, though, some Applications which may achieve something similar, requiring both computers to be connected to the same LAN/WiFi/VPN, and sending all the information, the one to be displayed on the second computer working as a display, through it. Such as ScreenRecycler. You can find some more here. \n\nA: Don't think it is possible as the iMac doesn't have a video input, only thunderbolt where you add Thunderbolt displays in a chain of 4+. I have the 27\" thunderbolt display and it works amazing, I switch between Mac Mini and my Macbook with 1 cable. The cable includes a MagSafe 1 power cable so there is no hassle for extra Macbook cables. It's pricey but it's worth it for all the features. And it supports latest windows computers with Thunderbolt supported motherboards. \n", "Q: New Activaction I bought a iPod 5 over the summer as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I purchased it from an estate sale; as it appeared to be in working order. However, my daughter tryed to setup her own iCloud account yesterday and received a message saying \"This iPod belongs to m......@icloud.com enter password\". I have no idea what her password is and don't remember where the sale was, what can I do?\n\nA: This question is answered numerous times in just about every corner of the Internet. As a safety feature the iPod is locked to the owner before since they set a password. There is no legitimate method of recovery. Sorry you got duped. \n", "Q: My iphone 5c won't turn on, it just uzzes while plugged in I recently fell on my iPhone while it was in my back pocket. The screen wasn't cracked but it refused to show the home screen. All the same noises were present (i.e; siri, charging). I tried a hard reset and now it won't turn on or light up at all and it buzzes constantly while on the charger. Any suggestions?\n\nA: While the glass did not crack it is highly likely that the digitizer itself was broken. It's a little uncommon for this to happen but I've fixed my fair share of phones like this. You need a new screen. (Full screen replacement(digitizer and glass))\n", "Q: How to ignore faces permanently in iPhoto? How to tell iPhoto to ignore the specific faces permanently if I want to ignore them. When I click close button it doesn't work, because the next time when I find faces, THE SAME faces appear again and again.\nAnyone knows how to fix this issue?\n\nA: When you click on \"search faces\", you will be presented with groups of four faces. Hover with the mouse over the picture of a face, and a small circle with an \"x\" will appear in the top left corner. When you select this x, this face will never pop up again.\nBut you have to do this for every instance of that face. If you have hundreds of images with one particular person which you will not add to your known faces, you will need to click on every instance of it.\n\nA: One way I've gotten around this is to \"name\" any people that I want to ignore with \"anonymous\", or \"X\", so that I can quickly put them in that category using the keyboard only and they will not show up every time I find faces. It would be great if there was a better way!\n", "Q: Change children's Apple ID I accidentally created an @icloud.com address for my kid's (under 13) Apple ID, and now I want to change the primary email to his correct address. However, there is no option for setting a new primary email when I sign into his account at appleid.apple.com. The correct address is listed under Alternative Email Addresses\n I thought maybe I'd have to change it through my account, but I couldn't find any help there either. How can I change his primary email address?\nEDIT: The only buttons next to the alternative email address are edit and delete. There are no buttons next to the primary address. Both addresses are verified\n\nA: http://appleid.apple.com/ is the correct place.\nIt's been awhile since I did this, but as I recall you will need to delete it as the secondary email then you can edit the primary.\nAlso, it's easiest if you turn off FindMyiPhone on the device before starting this process.  After all changes have been made and you are logged back into iCloud on the device using the new appleid then be sure and turn FindMyiPhone back on. (FindMyiPhone is a security feature and one it's purposes is to make it difficult for someone without the appleId details to log out. Changing your appleId can confuse the secuirty features, solution is to turn it off during this process.)\nAlso realize that once you have made the change at appleid.apple.com, the are multiple places in settings on the phone to logout and log back in under the new: iCloud, iTunes and App Store, facetime, messages, Game Center, and likely email needs setup changes.\nEdit (based on OP's comment below): Apple states that \"If your email address ends with @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com, it's already an Apple ID.\" Therefor it's not going to be possible to make this appleid have a different primary email address.  If you want an appleid using your son non @icloud.com address you will have to create it.  In order for that to happen you may have to delete it as the secondary on this account.  There is logic in no edit button appearing for the primary. If you made this appleid differnt, how could the @icloud address still be an appleid?\n\nA: If an Apple ID is created as an iCloud.com account, you are unable to change the primary email address. You can add a rescue email address to the account, in order to make changing passwords or resetting security questions easier.\n", "Q: is there a shortcut to expand folders in Finder while being in Cover Flow mode? in Finder I can use the arrow keys to go up and down and with \"left arrow\" and \"right arrow\" I can expand a folder while being in List View mode.\nHowever, when I'm in Cover Flow mode the \"left arrow\" and \"right arrow\" do the same as \"up arrow\" and \"down arrow\", i.e. just go up and down in the list.\nHow can I expand a folder while being in Cover Flow?\n\nA: aaaand while typing the question I just played around and figured it out:\nIn order to expand a folder you need to use COMMAND+\"left arrow\" and COMMAND+\"right arrow\" respectively.\n", "Q: How to make Application's windows always display in the same Monitor when having multiple displays?

Since updating to Yosemite OS X 10.10.1, I cannot recover my files stored as Time Machine backups on my external drive. In the finder, it cannot be see under devices, however in Disk Utility, it is visible. The mounted partition is not viewable, however. My own native hard drive is 200 GB while the external hd is 500 GB. There's no creating a 500 GB image on my hard drive, in other words. I've tried the latest versions of Paragon NTFS and Tuxera NTFS with no avail.\nHow am I to recover my files, most importantly my Time Machine backups, from my external drive?\nMacBook\n\nA: Connect your HDD to Windows computer and check&fix it (it is under properties of that drive).\nAfter that reformat the drive to HFS+ if you want to use it with Time Machine.\nNTFS is not supported filesystem for Time Machine why did you started to use it in the first place?\n\nA: This happened to me with a WD external 1TB hard drive (where I kept Time Machine backups) right after doing a clean install of Yosemite. The drive would be visible in Finder, sometimes it wouldn't, and even thought it would mount, I was unable to access the drive via the Finder or Terminal. It had some sort of denied access. It sounds similar so hope this helps...\nIf I recall correctly after all the troubleshooting, I found that the permissions on the volume were changed for some reason. The user did not have read nor write access. It was completely removed.\nIf you get to see your drive in Finder, select the volume (drive), and hit Command-I. This will bring up the \"Get Info\" page where at the bottom you can see the users who have access to the drive. If you don't see your user, add it. You should be able to use your drive now.\nLet me know if this worked as I can investigate further the steps I took. I just wanted to provide a quick response from what I remember worked.\n\nA: Try getting another external, then Disk Utility/Restore. That will reformat the external, so copy all data off it.\n", "Q: Script to remove image orientation I need to remove the orientation \"flag\" of a batch of images (jpeg images), without changing the displayed orientation of the images.\nTrying to make it clear : if I have an image in portrait orientation with an orientation flag, I want it to keep this portrait orientation, but get rid of the orientation flag, as it seems some application are not able to handle it correctly.

Once this window is open I strongly suggest you set your default shell back to the system-provided bash by running:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nOnce you do this, you can change Terminal.app's preferences back to Default login shell.\n\nA: You installed another version of bash,right?

(I'm guessing there's some kind of cache I should delete.)\n\nA: Do you want to disable the App re-open the documents when you launch the App?\nSo, you can go to \"System Preferences\" > \"General\" and enable the \"close windows when quitting and app\" option.\n\nA: To amplify what Nelson said above, here are the full list of steps which worked for me on OSX 10.10.2:\nQuit Preview if it’s running.\nHold down the option key and select Go ▹ Library from the Finder menu bar. From the Library folder, delete the following items, if they exist:\n      Containers/com.apple.Preview\n\n      Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist\n\n      Preferences/com.apple.Preview.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist\n\n      Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState\n\nLog out and log back in.

Then Quit the app.\nI have several windows/documents (in textedit) that I leave open when I quit, so they will open when I reopen the app, it works with most OSX 10.10 apps. I use them as a sort of note pad, NOTE: if the system crashes you could loose the data if they have not been saved at some time.\n\nA: You can do a Finder search for com.apple.preview and find the files you need to remove: \nFrom Terminal, you can go to\n~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.apple.Preview.savedState/\nThere you can remove the window_*.data files that include your previously open file list.\nYou can also remove windows.plist and that gets rid of all of them.\n\nA: This worked for a colleague: you can type alt/optcmdW when opening Preview, then quit an re-open.\n", "Q: How to unblock extensions in Safari so I can install adblock?

I happened to name some of my photo folders \"*.Playground\" (e.g., some date plus the \".Playground\"), it got picked up happily by Xcode and now OS X treats it like a file associated with Xcode, even changing the filename doesn't help.\nDoes anyone know a way to force the file to be treated as a Folder?\n\nA: I created a folder with two .jpg files in it, and renamed the folder \"Today.Playground\". As you say, it got associated with Xcode. (Nifty icon!)\nSo I changed the name to \"Today.layground\". At first, Finder wouldn't show me what was in it. (That is, I was viewing it in column view, and column to the right showed a preview of a generic folder, instead of listing what was in it.) I clicked on another item and then clicked on the folder again, and Finder properly showed the two .jpg files still inside.\nIt appears to me that that's all you have to do: look away and then look again.\n\nA: But thanks to ganbustein@'s answer, which led me to find the solution (since I wanted to create the jpg files via commandline):\nI noticed that even though I changed the name to something else via Finder, it still appends a hidden extension of (.playground) to it, so I just renamed the folders there and the folders are back!\nAlternatively, I think if I had Finder show extensions for all files and I can do the renaming in Finder as well.\n", "Q: How can I get my videos from a digital camera to OSX and iPhone? I have Sony NEX 3N. I can find AVCHD file when camera plugged to the computer\n\nthat fires QuickTime \n\nwhere I can export videos to different social services such as YouTube but I cannot find the video files itself. I want videos to directories such as Dropbox directories. Then I want to organise the videos by timestamps.\n\nI have used Aperture for pictures and Final Cut Pro for editing videos. Now I want to get the videos as files without middlemen like QuickTime or Final Cut Pro. I need the videos from Sony NEX 3N to my iPhone where I have video collage creation applications and more videos. So my plan is to have the video files as raw in Dropbox and somehow get them to iPhone or is there any easier method?\nHow can I get videos from the camera to OSX? What about to iPhone? How can I manage this process?\n\nA: This is the solution I am using for fast small improvisation\nI create a new Aperture production library for each new project. I don't want to mess up the originals. I import all necessary videos and pictures to the new production Aperture library and then syncronise that production library through iTunes: clean and simple! Sometimes the syncronisation has some problems but then you just need to close your Aperture and close your iTunes. The syncronisation does not look to work most reliably that is a bit painful. To circumvent the syncronisation problem: the Time Capsule  may be a solution -- as suggested here.\n\nAnalysis\nCommunity wiki answer where I am documenting solutions. Bruno here provided the solution fastest for finding the files in Quora but I am not able to get them into iTunes. I don't know yet how to syncronize things over OSX and iPhone now easiest, testing.\n0. Create iMovie projects in OS X and iOS that you synchronise -question\nI.

Enjoy!\n\n\nII. How to get MTS files to iPhone?\n\nMTS files do not work directly in iPhone. So you cannot transfer them just like that from the STREAM/*.MTS to DropBox and open in iPhone.\n\nIII. How can I get the videos from the camera to iTunes and sync to iPhone? Drag and dropping does not work from the video view to iTunes.\n\n\n\nIV. How to get the videos easiest to iPhone from the Sony camera?\n\nI don't know the answer yet.\n\nV. How to get the videos easiest to OSX from the Sony camera and iPhone?\n\nI don't know the answer yet.\n\n\nA: As you've noticed QuickTime supports (as of quite recently) the AVCHD container format and the MTS or M2TS files therein. Because of this, you can use iMovie to import them into an iMovie library. This importing process will remux the videos (i.e. change container format) to MOV which are obviously much better supported, not only as individual videos, but for a wider range of Apple software/devices.\nI've not tried just using those MOV files on an iOS device, but would assume at the least iMovie for iOS can use them.\nSo far I'm not aware of any super easy way to move iMovie video events from OS X over to an iOS device (you can AirDrop from iOS to Mac but not the other way around!), but you could certainly grab the MOV files out of the iMovie library and copy those over.\nThis removes the problem of having unwatchable MTS files or an annoying AVHCD container, but the issue of painlessly synchronising to iOS remains unsolved.\nI guess a possible solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a new iMovie library in Dropbox\n\n*create just one single event that you use for all importing\n\n*set up the \"Original Media\" directory as some kind of bookmark in the Dropbox app (can you do this?)\n\n*after importing on OS X, use Dropbox to view the Dropbox/iMovie Library/EventName/Original Media folder to see the .MOV files.\n\n", "Q: Why is my script editor coming up with connection invalid after running it for a while?

How do u stop this from happening. \n\nA: Do you share an AppleID? More generally, does he know the password to your AppleID. If so, then yes, he can tell Apple that his phone (or Mac) is one of the places you want your messages to be delivered.\nIf that's not what you want, change your password. \n\nA: This is likely to be a iCloud syncing issue.\nAssuming that you are using an Apple device (which is why you're here) then each photo you send/receive may be getting automatically backed up to your iCloud account. This might also be configured on another device (eg computer, iPad, iPod, etc.) that your Ex has. (Or maybe he set up your phone and you are using the same Apple ID.)\nOn an iPhone, you goto Settings > iCloud > Photos and turn off photo sharing.\nIf you go to www.icloud.com you will be able to see all the content he has been able to access and delete it. \nFinally, as others above have suggested, you must also change your Apple ID Password immediately.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: iPhone 5 won't start after an iTunes recovery I shut down my iPhone 5 phone in the middle of an iTunes purchase download. \nI went to an At&T store and they reset the phone.

I also have a Mac OS Leopard Drop-in DVD that will boot to the installation menu but will not install because 10.4 is not found on the HD.\nI have a MacBook Pro with Yosemite loaded and purchased a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter and Firewire 800 to 400 cable to connect to the iMac.

System requirements for OS X 10.7 is at least 2GB RAM though. So you might check first if you have enough. These are guides on how to get to the memory.\nThen you will need USB pen drive and Lion Disk Maker to make it bootable out of bought file.\nThe mac will accept 2 or 3GB of DDR2-667 SODIMM RAM total(depending on exact model).\n\nA: 2006 is the year when Apple switched from PowerPC CPUs to Intel CPUs, so you've probably got a PowerPC MacOSX Tiger Installer. (which cannot run on Intel MBPs)\nIf you cannot boot the installer disc from iMac, then your iMac is probably also Intel.

Review the other kernel panic logs, as the one you posted shows that it suffered a GPU Panic in that instance.

I finally figured out that VLC was opening the video window in a new \"Space\", so after it started I would have to slide over to the next Space. Try that. \n\nA: I've experienced something similar with VLC. Typically, I play vids in full screen on my second display connected to my MacBook. When I am not connected to the external display and I play a vid, VLC seems to want to still play in this dual display mode. So it's like it's playing on a ghost second display.\nIf this is your situation, the easiest solution is to simply press 'Escape'. That pulls the vid out of full screen mode (on the ghost second monitor) and displays it in windowed mode.\nFrom there you should be good.\n(P.S. I just wrote this same thing in another similar VLC post today... Must be something in the air.)\n\nA: Go to the preferences and select \"Show video within main window\"\n", "Q: How can I open MTS video files to iPhone's photostream so applications can use them? My goal is to have the MTS files in PhotoStream so that all of my iPhone applications such as video collage creator apps can use them. MTS video files are files created by Sony Nex 3N camera that are downloaded to MacOS X and Dropbox.\n\n\n\nI am using iMovie 10.0.6 in MacOS X.\nHow can I open MTS video files in iPhone in a way that video editing apps are able to use them?\n\nA: You need to convert them first.\nI recommend using Handbrake application for this. It is free and solid.\n\nA: This is what works based on iskra's tip about Handbrake. I am now one step closer to video improvisation: next I need to understand how to deal with the AVCHD files in OS X. I think the best idea is to do all cutting/cleaning-up and things like that in OS X before transmitting to iOS with Handbreak or anything.\nPuzzle 1: best way to convert MTS files to iPhone. There are many options Handbrake and Handbrake Alternative. Others?\n\nHandbrake\n\nProcedure that avoids the \"no valid source selected\"\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the AVCHD file away from your camera to some harddrive (and free space from your camera)\n\n\n*rename the AVCHD file and rename the BDMV -- now when you clip them in Handbrake you can get into the MTS files\n\nDiscussion\nYou store the AVCHD without changing them or importing them anywhere in your external hardrive (best idea with this large files).\nMy plan is after all shooting sessions to remove the material away from the camera so material irrelevant to each other won't get into the libraries.\n\nALERT! Conversion of MTS files to iPhone file type: eg 1.5 GB video about (15 minutes) required 15 minutes' conversion on Macbook Air 1.8 GHz -- far too long time for improvisational material!\n\n\nRelated historical material\n\n\n*\n\n*comment to iskra's Handbrake: when I select the AVCHD thing, it says \"No valid source found\" -- how can I get the AVCHD into\nHandbrake?\n\n\nand\ninstructions\n\nPuzzle 2. Is handbrake really a solution to this? Or should I use Handbrake\nAlternative\nto get the ACHD videos to iPhone?\n\nSolution: rename the folder names and you will get the MTS files to be accessed by Handbrake: it is not programmed automatically to dig into the AVCHD folders.\n\n\n\nA: Up until iMovie 10.x (currently the latest version; previous version was 9.x and also called iMovie '11) there was no native support for AVCHD, but this has changed.\nIf you're able to run iMovie 10.x (I think it requires OS X 10.9 Mavericks or newer) you can natively import the AVCHD files, and it will quickly and losslessly convert them to MOV files that should be much more compatible with OS X & iOS devices.\nAs far as I can tell it's just a \"remuxing\" of the original files, i.e. moving the H.264 video from the AVCHD/MTS/M2TS container into a MOV container, so is way faster than Handbrake.\n(I personally think it was a ridiculous oversight that Apple didn't support AVCHD about 3-4 years ago, but better late than never I guess).\n\nA: I'm doing it now directly on an iPad. My workflow is:\nImport with Lexar microSD reader to iConv. iConv allows converting .mts to .mov and saving to PhotoStream.\nI'm currently trying to find an alternative to iConv as I have not yet purchased the pro version and I think it's a bit expensive for a simple converter.\n", "Q: Why does Finder see volumes which are not under /Volumes? If I navigate as high as possible in Finder (under 10.10.2, but this did not appear only recently), I see this window, with many volumes which are long unmounted, ejected and erased.\n\nBut if I tried to look around in the Terminal to potentially delete these, it only found the reasonable ones:\nLaszlo-Sandors-MacBook-Pro:Volumes laszlosandor$ ls -la\ntotal 24\ndrwxrwxrwt@  5 root          admin   170 Dec 28 09:04 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  47 root          wheel  1666 Dec 26 10:57 ..\n-rw-r--r--@  1 laszlosandor  admin  6148 Jul 17 18:33 .DS_Store\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root          admin     1 Dec 26 10:51 Macintosh HD -> /\ndrwxrwxrwx   0 root          wheel     0 Dec 28 10:51 MobileBackups\n\nDisk Utility only sees Macintosh HD.\nWhat is going on, and what is there to do?\n\nA: Finder will show all mounted volumes, regardless of where it's mounted from.\nOpen up Terminal (from Applications -> Utilities) and type 'mount' then hit enter. You'll get output similar to this:\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  mount\n/dev/disk3s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk8s2 on /Users (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)\n\nThis shows what's mounted, and where. I have a disk mounted under /Users and Finder still shows it at the top level.\nThis should tell you where those volumes are coming from.\nAlso, try clicking on one and either cmd-I, or File -> Get Info, to see what Finder thinks it is.\n\nA: Unix wants to present all of your files in a single hierarchical tree, no matter what device they're on. This makes it possible to name any file on any disk using a single descriptive string, called its path.\nIn order to do this, when a new disk volume is mounted, whoever mounts it names an existing folder to be the \"mount point\" for the volume. Whatever was in that folder becomes inaccessible, replaced by whatever is at the top level of the newly mounted disk image. When the disk is later unmounted, the folder and its contents become accessible once again.\nUnix permits any folder to be \"sacrificed\" in this way. OS X is based on Unix, but does not normally avail itself of this flexibility. It prefers to \"sacrifice\" a newly created empty folder as the mount point. /Volumes is the place where OS X conventionally creates this folder. When the volume is unmounted, OS X also removes the newly exposed and still empty folder.\nBut that's only an OS X convention. OS X is still Unix under the hood, and Unix apps can still mount volumes on whatever folder they want.\nActually, OS X sometimes does, too. That's how FileVault I works. Your home folder contains only an encrypted sparse bundle disk image. When you log in, your password is used to decrypt and mount the disk image, using your home folder itself as the mount point. The disk image (and anything else in your home folder) become inaccessible, but that's OK. The disk image is already mounted, and doesn't need to be found again. In fact, it's good that it can't be accessed, because that keeps anyone from fiddling with it while the user is logged in. When the user logs out, the disk image is unmounted, and the \"real\" home folder becomes accessible again.\nFinder synthesizes its top-level list from many sources. Obviously the list includes anything that really is at the top level of your boot volume and is not invisible. You know it also throws into the mix any volumes with mount points inside /Volumes. But it doesn't stop there. For example, hdiutil info lists all volumes mounted from disk images or from RAM disks, no matter whether their mount point is in /Volumes or not. More generally, OS X also inherits from MacOS a method to find info about every mounted volume however it got mounted.\nMost of your unexplained items seem to be Google-related.

Perhaps this kind of pattern, combined with the delicious foods behind them, makes iPhoto think faces are in the image when they aren't.\nThis Apple Discussions thread discusses the inability to turn off face detection in iPhoto, but talks about being able to turn it off in Aperture.\nUnfortunately, other than marking each of these phantom faces and deleting their entries, or taking the photos with the oven door open, I think you'll have no luck fixing the problem.\nI have to admit I'm chuckling at these two images you've provided. \n", "Q: AppleTV interrupting while playing movie My new black Apple TV (3rd generation) is plugged into my flatscreen by HDMI. All worked fine. \nA few days ago there were sudden \"interruptions\" while watching a show from netflix: no video, no sound, black screen. After a few seconds, video and sound returned, my screen shows a message that it is connected to a HDMI source.\nFrom that message, I understand that the HDMI connection was lost. ATV has the latest software, the interruptions come and go, no pattern to be detected.\nAnybody know what I can do, apart from returning the ATV and getting a new one? \n\nA: \nHDMI connection lost\n\nCould mean that the HDMI cable is not having good contacts on the pins.\nThe only way to test that is to get different HDMI cable.\nApple also provides some instruction on how to fix it.\n", "Q: Automatic mounting of encrypted partitions on OS X There is a well-documented method of getting Unix to automatically mount a partition on Mac OS X, namely adding something like this to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=C92FFDDD-5E09-34ED-A10D-914EA92EA888 /MountPoint hfs auto\n\nHowever if the partition is encrypted, this won't work.  Does anyone know is there a way to get Unix to mount encrypted partitions?\n\nA: I'm using Unlock by Justin Ridgewell to mount my FileVault2 (CoreStorage) encrypted HDD that I have replaced my SuperDrive with.\nUnlock will loop through your CoreStorage encrypted volumes (sans boot) and ask if you want them unlocked upon booting.  The passphrase for unlocking them will then be stored in the System Keychain so that another user could login and have them automatically mounted even if they don't know the passphrase for the volume.\nSo it's a boot time unlocking vs a user login unlocking.\n", "Q: Mac OSX upgrade Adobe Flash Player, download stops I am on Yosemite 10.10.1. For some reason (maybe corrupted initial download) the 1.2MB installer stops at around 30% (34%, 35% or 36%) downloading the full installer.\n\nA: I spent some time why but I just gave up. Here is my workaround and I hope it will help others. The workaround is to download the offline installer from this page http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/distribution3.html. Download the \"DMG Installer (for System Administrators)\" and install. After installing restart Safari for example and verify from http://www.adobe.com/uk/software/flash/about/ that you have installed.\n", "Q: External Monitor's USB ports don't work I have connected an external monitor to my macbook pro through a thunderbolt vga adapter. The monitor has several USB ports on it and if I plug a mouse or keyboard into them, they will not work. Is there a fix for this?\n\nA: You'll need to connect a USB cable (probably A/B) from the monitor to your laptop.\n\nA: Before assuming that their is a problem with your device.  Some P.C's Require a manaul download of a driver. Which can be found Apple web sight.Original cable for your device is a must. If you have a cable for a camera device with the apple plug should be saficient. Sometimes additional driver to communicate with manufactures is also required for image or file output. Off brand cables are no good.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro no longer connects to wireless network. All other devices do I haven't made a single change to my wireless network over the last few months. However, lately, my macbook pro will NOT connect to either of the 2 SSIDs that I have broadcasting. Both wireless networks are using WPA2 PSK.\nThe one that it will connect to is using WPA2 PSK as well. I have like 8 devices in my home that are connecting to this wireless network, and I can re-connect all of them just fine. Even disconnecting some and trying to connect the laptop will not work.\nIs there any way to do like a hard reset or something with the wireless profile? This is very annoying. No changes have been made on the WLAN, so I see no reason why I'm having issues.\nThe only thing that I've done on my Macbook Pro lately was delete my old KeyChain profile, but since I'm \"forgetting\" the wireless network and re-adding it, I don't see why this would have any effect.\nI've tried changing the wireless network password to \"Password1\", bringing the encryption down to WPA instead of WPA2.. Still nothing.\n\nA: I know you probably already tried this but in an effort to point to the problem being with your Macbook Pro can you connect to a network that is not yours?  (e.g. a friends or someone else's?)\nAlso, you've probably done this too but sometimes just a reboot may help.\n", "Q: How can I sync photos between iPhone 5s and iPad mini without using a laptop? I can do it using a laptop. But is there a way I can do it without passing them through a laptop each time?\n\nA: In my understanding, I suppose that Photo Stream will do the trick.\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Photos > My Photo Sream, and turn it on.\nEnable iCloud on both devices using the same Apple ID, and you can see the latest photos in Photos.\nApple - iCloud - Photos\n\nA: If you want your photo library to be completely in sync across your devices, you need to use iCloud Photo Library. You'll need to be on iOS 8.3 or later on both devices.\nLog into the same iCloud account on both devices, then go to Settings > iCloud > Photos, and turn on iCloud Photo Library. Go to the Photos app, make sure it's uploading, and then it'll take care of itself.\nIf you have more than 5 GB of photos, you'll have to pay monthly for iCloud storage. The cheapest plan is 50 GB for $0.99 a month.\nIf your devices don't have enough storage to hold all your photos, you'll want to select \"Optimize [device] Storage\", so only recent photos, favorites, and photos you look at often will be kept on the device. The others will be stored in the cloud, and they'll download when you tap on them.\n\nA: Enable iCloud on both devices using the same Apple ID. Make sure Photos is turned on with most of the options turned on (perhaps not \"Upload Burst Photo's\").\n\nA: If you don't want to ensure iCloud then you could simply try using AirDrop which is the most convenient way to transfer anything between multiple Apple devices\n", "Q: \"Look Up in Dictionary\" stopped working in Chrome on Mac OS X 10.10.2 I upgraded my Mac to OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 recently. Since then the dictionary lookup stopped working in Chrome. Tried both keyboard shortcut and context menu. Know of any workaround for this issue?\n\nA: I also went to the trackpad part of preferences and unchecked and checked the force click look-up option and it worked again.\n\nA: I encountered same issue, but that's because I turned on some option Chrome pops up to suggest me to use Chrome itself for dictionary lookup.\n\n\nA: Maybe not directly answering the original question, but for some reason the three-finger tap became disabled by default in El Capitan update (OS X 10.11). I had to go to the \"trackpad\" part of system settings and reenable it. Then it worked normally again.\n", "Q: How to make an application to be on top at startup instead of Finder in Yosemite? On Yosemite I would like to have an application show up as the top running application (it takes over the screen and hides the menu bar).\nWhen you set up an application for startup in the user account under Yosemite, the application starts but finder always comes up on top of it and any applications set for startup behind it.\n\nA: Just make sure your finder isn't set to run on startup. Thats the easiest work around. You could do a lot of things like Automator, AppleScript etc, but just set your Finder menu to not populate on start up. \nI can't duplicate your error. \nNote : Finder will always take precedence when it's open the first time. \nGo to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items and make sure Finder isn't there. If it is delete it. Also, Relaunch Finder, could be in there. If it is, delete it.\nMake sure none of the applications that you want to display are set to hidden. \nIf neither are there its an OS glitch. \nOpen Application> Utilities> Disk Utility> Select Macintosh HD> First Aid> Verify Disk Permissions> (when done) Repair Disk Permissions\nRestart your system\nAdditionally, when you restart or shutdown if the box below is checked and Finder window is currently open then it will naturally reopen upon restart. Make sure all windows are closed or the box is not checked if necessary.\n\nIf that does not work a clean OS install would correct your issue.\nIf your asking how to make an application show on log in and show Finder window on login too but make the application fullscreen you can not do that without some scripting or automator process.\n", "Q: Read dead iPhone's files? I have a broken iPhone 4S with iOS 8.1.1 jailbroken. It fell a lot, and the battery connector (I forgot to screw it back in) ripped out of it and the screen is broken so even if I place it and hold it with my fingers against the pins, it turns on but the screen is not possible to see as it just flickers. It also does not turn on all the way and right when it does, it just restarts so I can't connect it to my computer.\nQuestion, how can I actually read the iPhone's HDD? Is it built in the motherboard? Is there anyway to buy something that would connect to it to read the files?\nThe reason for this is, I have about 300 songs on there and a lot of photos and the music has been copied to a different folder from Filza. I am comfortable taking the phone apart, it actually is apart right now pretty much and I just need help reading the files of a dead iPhone.\n\nA: If the connector is 'ripped out', the only way to access the data would be to 1) hope the internals are still intact after all that falling--and other--damage, and 2) find another iPhone 4s, and transfer the 'old' inner stuff to the new phone and go from there. This is not a trivial operation (see the iFixit guides), and I would only attempt this if 1) the data is irreplaceable, and 2) you have familiarity with such work.\n", "Q: Is there a difference between HDMI or Thunderbolt for monitor? This is my configuration: \n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung S22A300B monitor (with VGA and DVI input)\n\n*Computer A\n\n*\n\n*2,6GHz Mac Mini from end of 2014\n\n*HDMI to DVI cable\n\n*Thunderbolt to VGA cable\n\n\n*Computer B\n\n*\n\n*Mac Book (yes, old)\n\n*output video to DVI cable (forget the connector name)\n\n\n\nMy problem is:  If I connect the Computer A to VGA, will I lose something in quality? With this configuration I can use booth computer on same monitor, just need to press the switch button. In another configuration, I will need to physically change the cables.\nSo, Is there a difference if I use Thunderbolt instead HDMI?\n\nA: Answering straight yes. You loose quality when connecting monitor with VGA.\nYou see VGA is analog standard and digital signal being first time converted into analog in a computer to be transmitted through VGA cable and then converted back into digital to be used by the digital TFT panel. Since there are few steps of converting signal and analog interference while in a cable you have few chances to loose on quality.\nThen it depends on particular setup, cables and quality of convertor when answering how much of quality being lost. So if you don't see that quality is degraded on you VGA connected MacMini compared to MacBook on DVI that it is safe it definitely more convenient to leave them as they are.\n", "Q: Best OS X for late 2009 MacBook I have a white 13\" MacBook (late 2009) with 2GB memory.\nIt is currently running Mavericks.\nThe machine is too slow, probably because the memory is just 2GB.\nI'm considering downgrading it back to its original OS, which was Snow Leopard.\nI bought Lion from the App Store when it came out, but I can't find it now, only Mountain Lion and Yosemite.\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be the ideal OS X for this machine?\n\n*If it is Lion, how would I go about getting another copy, given that I've bought one once already?\n\n*What if I upgraded the memory to 4GB? (But installing new memory requires opening the machine up, which is not so easy.)\n\nA: You basically have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't want to open up machine then install Snow Leopard as leanest of them all. It will be fast though few resource hungry apps or web pages can bog it down. \nAnother minus of the path is that Snow Leopard being released July 25, 2011 is going to be unsupported soon if not already. At least latest NTP patch doesn't apply to it.\n\n*If you do to open it. And it is not that hard really with this machine see instruction. Then I would say add 8GB while you are there. It supports up to 2x4GB SO-DIMM DDR3-1066 modules(choose big names like Hynix, Samsung, Crucial for compatibility). Regarding OS X choice it is either 10.9 as more polished or 10.10 as the latest. Clearly 10.9 behaves a lot more solid on the machine. But if you need 10.10 it will also be fine. Safari is definitely snappier on it.\nRegarding 10.7 Lion. It just doesn't make sense. It is no faster than Mavericks on 2GB but it is definitely slower than 10.6 Snow Leopard. \nI put 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD in place of Superdrive in same machine recently, installed 10.10 and it will be fine for few more years for light to medium tasks. Good luck\n\nA: I don't know if this is still relevant given the date of the original posting. I am presently using a late 2009 MacBook with 8GB of RAM, a 250GB SSD (from OWL) and High-Sierra. The machine is very fast. I compose music (I am a professional) on it and it runs very well. Given the fact that High-Sierra may be supported for maybe two more years it is worth upgrading RAM and HD and buy yourself a couple of extra years.\nP.\n\nA: If I were you I'd update the RAM to 8GB (Apple says 4GB is the max supported, but you can go to 8GB) and install Yosemite. \nWithout updating beyond 2GB, I would try either Snow Leopard, or Mountain Lion. The downside of using the older OSes is that they are unsupported, so you won't get security updates. \n\nA: Processing speed (and the processing speed of the graphics processor) also have a huge impact on the snappiness feel of a computer. Using activity monitor, check how much ram it is actually using. If it is reaching %80 used then a RAM upgrade makes sense. I have a mac-book pro with 4GB which I bought used. Yet it feels fast. It is even older, being from 2008. It does have a better processor however. \nRam is not everything. \n", "Q: Can new colours be given to new tags? I wanted to add new tags to the standard set AND to give them colours of their own but I have not been able to do it. For instance, I would like to have a brand-new Black tag. Any ideas?\nThanks in advance,\nNacho\nP.S. Notice that I am referring to Yosemite\n\nA: You can only use the set tag colours; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, or gray.\nYou're not able to set your own colour, so the closest colour for you would probably be gray.\n", "Q: Files Greyed out in Finder - Potential extended attributes issue? I am having a rather strange issue with some image files I have on a local file server. I have spent a while trying to figure it out, to no avail. Hopefully someone on here can offer some assistance.\nRecently, after I import image files from my camera, they appear greyed out in my finder window, and I cannot open them or copy them. Terminal sees them just fine, and I can operate on them without issue. If I copy the files to a new directory after clearing the xattrs, they work just fine. This is somewhat of a pain, and does take time for large amounts of files, so I'd like to avoid this if possible. I have seem some people suggest that the xattrs are at fault with similar issues, so I first checked that out. There are indeed extended attributes on the affected files, notably com.apple.FinderInfo. If I either delete com.apple.FinderInfo, or completely remove xattrs with:\nxattr -c *\nthe files are no longer greyed out and are accessible again.\nThe crux of the issue is that after some time (about 15 secs or so), Finder regenerates the com.apple.FinderInfo xattr, and the files are greyed out and inaccessible again.\nSome potentially helpful notes I've compiled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before being greyed out, the date modified shows correctly as Today\n\n*After being greyed out, the date modified (in Finder) shows as\nJanuary 24, 1984\n\n*Interestingly, even after being greyed out, the date modified from\na GetFileInfo command shows correctly as Today, even though it shows at 1984 in Finder\n\n*Performing a touch on the greyed out file doesn't change the incorrect Date Modified in the Finder window\n\n*Performing mdls on either the parent folder or the greyed out file shows one interesting field: kMDItemFSCreationDate      = 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\n\n*If I copy the affected folder from within Terminal while the files are greyed out, the problem persists in the new folder; If I copy the folder after deleting the xattrs without giving com.apple.FinderInfo a chance to regenerate, the new files don't seem to have com.apple.FinderInfo regenerate, and are able to be opened and copied just fine\n\n*For some reason, I can't seem to update permissions on the affected files. After a sudo chmod a+rwx * I still get this permissions string from ls: -rwx------@\n\n*The files are stored on a smb share from a local networked server running ZFS on FreeNAS 9.2.1.8; I believe I first encountered this issue sometime after updating the FreeNAS version, but I can't be sure whether or not that caused it, as I'm sure other software on my computer changed during that period as well.\n\n*At some point in the past I changed some Finder preferences to disable .DS_Store creation on network shares, as there is no .DS_Store file generated in these directories\n\n\nAny help on this issue would be much appreciated, as it's starting to drive me a little crazy. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: This worked, but after external disk (NTFS) eject the problem was back\nxattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo fileToUpdate \n\n(or for all files in a folder xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo *)\nThis worked after eject/re-mount\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \n\n0000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 fileToUpdate\n\nNotes from man xattr:\n xattr -w [-rsx] attr_name attr_value file ...\n xattr -x  Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal representation.\n\n", "Q: Need to know how to set up WiFi for FireHD 7 on hardwired iMAC desktop Got a Fire HD 7 for christmas present.

I have an additional user [Update Needed] appear on login screen at every boot, which doesn't affect usability but a bit annoying. I googled for solution, but all of them are just disabling and enabling FileVault again. That would be time-consuming, somewhat harmful to the SSD, and would leave bits of sensitive data unencrypted on the disk. Is there any other way? Like some terminal commands?\n\nA: If the Mac in question is running OS X 10.8.x or later, you can remove users from the list of FileVault enabled accounts using the fdesetup remove command. To remove the account using the username, run the following command:\nsudo fdesetup remove -user username\n\nSuccessful removal of the account will not produce any additional output. \n\nIf the account being removed is not currently enabled for use with FileVault 2, an error message will be displayed.\n\nDoes the icon you're seeing look like this?\n\nIf it does, this isn't a user account.

However there are some special cases that it doesn't handle as I would like it to.\nFor instance, my sister has an iPad with iMessage set up, but she uses an Android phone (i.e. no iMessage). If I try to send her a message from my Mac, it usually (not sure if always) sends to her iMessage account. This is a problem since she doesn't always have her iPad with her so sometimes she doesn't see my message for a long time. On my phone my messages with her are split into two threads, one for iMessages and one for SMS messages, so I always reply to the correct address. However, on the Mac they are merged into one thread. So sometimes she sends me a SMS from her phone, which I receive on the Mac, but when I reply it sends an iMessage.\nIs there a way to either force Messages on the Mac to send to a specific address or to split the thread as it is on the iPhone?\n\nA: you can choose where your message will go: click on the little down arrow right to the recipient's name, and select the destination Message or iMessage (or even other chat system like jabber or bonjour).\n\nA: You can direct a message to a particular destination using the Contact Card. Right-click  a conversation with your sister from the list on the left and choose \"Show Contact Card\" from the pop-up menu, click the label beside the entry for her Android phone (such as \"Mobile\" or \"Work\"), then select Send Message from the pop-up menu.\n", "Q: Duplicate icons in Applications Dock Stacks A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nI have a shortcut (not sure what the official word for this is) to my Applications folder in my Dock.\nWhen opening it, I see multiple copies of the icon \"Xcode.app\".\nIf I \"open in finder\", I only see one.

How can I download the app?\n\nEdit: Instead of resetting my iPad, please let me know if there is any other option?\n\nA: The most probable source of your problem is Apple just changed their terms and conditions for the App Store and they won't let you download anything till you accept them.\nWhenever Apple change their terms and conditions, the App Store app has a strange behavior (since I had an iPod touch in 2008). One typical situation is that it won't let you download an item that you had already bought.\nWhat you should do is install a new app (one you have never downloaded). Then it will take a lot of time and finally (and hopefully, otherwise you should kill the App Store app and begin the process again), the new terms and conditions page will appear for you to accept them.\nOnce you accept the terms and conditions, you'll be able to download your previously downloaded app.\nAs you see, the problem doesn't have anything to do with the iPad crash but with the coincidence in time with the terms and conditions change.\n\nA: Does it still not download after you turn off (power off all the way via holding sleep button for 3+ seconds and sliding to turn off) and turn back on the iPad?\nThat's always solved this for me.\n\nA: Try resetting your iPad.\nGo to Settings > Reset > Reset all Content and Settings \nMake sure you have backed up your iPad, so you can restore afterwards. \n\nA: Have you checked to see if the game is already on your iPad? If it is, try deleting it. \nIs it an iPad 1? The latest version that the iPad 1 runs is iOS 5.1.1. Double check that the game supports your version of iOS. Some apps will install but crash immediately. The game developer may have updated the compatibility since then. \nThe App Store entry for Amazing Ninja says iOS 6.0 and above. That doesn't mean it actually works on iOS 6, let alone iOS 5.1.1.\n\nA: I ran into this problem on my wife's iPhone 6s and iOS 10.1.1 -- but only for one particular app. I could download other new apps without a problem.\nI couldn't fix it, ultimately I had to install via iTunes. I tried all the measures listed here except wiping the phone.\n", "Q: What happens to iOS Apps when you turn OFF Family Sharing? I have Family Sharing turned on currently, but no longer wish all my family's purchases to come from the one credit card.\nAs some iOS apps have been bought for the benefit of the whole family, what happens to these apps if I were to turn off the Family Sharing feature?\nI note that any In-App Purchases will not be shared (which is fine), but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the apps continue to reside on all the other people's phones and be updatable etc?\n\n*Presuming 1. to be \"Yes\", what happens if in the future they remove it from their phone, but then want it back again?\n\n*Does it show as purchased on their accounts?\n\n*If the answer to 3 is \"no\", would turning Family Sharing back on temporarily solve this?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Before Family Sharing, you could take someone else's iOS device and sign in to the app store with your account and download all/any apps you choose.\nAt that point, your password was needed to update, but signing out didn't delete the apps or in any other way prevent them from working. Let's set aside in-app purchases for the time being.\nFamily sharing changes this in that when someone joins the \"family\" - their Apple ID is used to download and update other family member apps. They do not show up in your purchases, they show up as the other named family member's purchase. All that changes is the password needed to install and update.\nWhen you as a family member remove yourself from the plan - you get a warning that lists what will happen and basically, you immediately lose access to the purchases, photos, calendars and other items that were shared in the plan.\n\nRejoining the family would then let you re-download and re-sync the items.\nYou'll probably want to find a better way to use the family service than routinely joining and leaving or skip the family share and use the older method of signing in to multiple devices which doesn't immediately remove/revoke the items.\n", "Q: How to access the full capacity of hard drives larger than 2TB with OS X Yosemite? Last week, I bought a 4TB hard drive to connect to my MacBook Pro. My quest to have access to all the 4TB on my Mac was more difficult than expected.\nAfter a lot of experimenting, I managed to create an exFat partition of 4TB. \n(For people who want to replicate my approach: I connected the HD using sata-cables to another computer, and booted the computer from a Windows 8.1 dvd. Next, I created the exFat partition using the partition manager on the dvd. When I started Windows 8, the disk manager showed me that I only had created a partition of 1.8TB. I removed this partition, and created a new one of 4TB. Next, I had access to the full 4TB of my new drive.)\nSince OS X also supports exFat, I figured I should be able to see the partition I created on Windows. This turned out to be wrong. When I connected the HD to my Mac using a docking station, the HD was visible in Disk Utility, but there were no partitions associated with it.\ndiskutil list shows the HDD as follows:\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.8 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n\nNow comes the strange part. When I run a Windows 7 virtual machine and connect the HD to this virtual machine, I have full access to the full 4TB.\nThe only conclusion I can draw at this moment is that OS X Yosemite does not support hard drives larger than 2TB.\nI would like to know if other Mac users have had more success than me in connecting a hard drive larger than 2TB to their Mac.\n\nA: \nThe only conclusion I can draw at this moment is that OS X Yosemite does not support hard drives larger than 2TB.\n\nVery wrong. Yosemite supports drives up to 8EB (exabytes. Or 8 million terabytes. You could download the internet with some room left over).\nWhat it has problems with is proprietary file formats from other companies, esp. if the patent holder doesn't want to share.\nIf you want to access the full drive on your Mac, repartition it in Disk Utility and format as HFS+. If you want to share the data on this very large volume across platforms, the easiest way is a NAS enclosure (Network Attached Storage - basically an external drive with an ethernet port). The disk format only matters to the device it's directly connected to.\n\nA: I read on another forum that there is an issue with Yosemite reading Windows formatted exFat drives.\nI don't seem to be able to find any workaround, so I am faced with the only viable option I can see: which is to copy stuff on disk to a Yosemite formatted hard disk.\nI don't know how Windows reacts to Yosemite formatted exFat drives, though.\n", "Q: any Virtual Ipad/Iphone applications for PC that has network connections? I am looking for a virtual emulation of an Ipad or Iphone that I can run on a PC machine so I can create video tutorials on things such as setting up our corporate email  or how to connect the devices to our network. I have found some applications via Google and youtube, but so far they do not support a network connection.  I know there are android emulators that do this, but haven't found an IOs one. If anyone could point me in the direction of one it would be greatly appreciated.\nI would prefer free software, but am willing to pay as long as its in a reasonable price range.\nI got the answer below, but I found a pretty promising site for anyone who happens to be looking for the same thing. Miricast and AirPlay emulation\n\nA: As there are no emulation / simulation engines that I've seen that work well enough to run tutorials in anything resembling a smooth manner, your least expensive option would be to get a cheap secondhand iPad and then use AirPlay emulation software on the PC to capture the screen and make your videos.\nYou could even save money by taking static screen captures and then animating them on the PC.\nThe only simulator that even comes close to what you need runs on OS X and is part of Xcode delivered from Apple. You could probably virtualize that, but the cost there is more than buying cheap used iOS hardware. Even an iPod touch is often good enough for walk through videos on basic settings for corporate users.\n\nA: You can make your PC to an Airplay server(just like AppleTV) via some App.\nyou can download airserver trial version\n", "Q: Sandvox: Only reachable within local network I have several Mac Minis using several OS (10.7.2-Intel Core 2 Duo, 10.8.5-Intel Core i5, 10.5.8-Power PC, 10.9.5-Intel Core i5, 10.6.8-Intel Core 2 Duo). I am using serving pages from all and built the sites using Sandvox. Until a couple of weeks ago everything was running fine. Also using DynDNS. Recently i modified some info on several and now Sandvox replies:\nOnly reachable within local network\nEvery pertinent port in the router is open… internally the page is webserved… \nhelp!\nthank you for your time and knowledge\n\nA: Hello… It was the DynDns software… reinstalled and almost everything is good now… only some bugs now\n", "Q: Adding \"local\" to the DNS Search Domains has no effect I have a Mac Mini (Yosemite) on my local network and it's not running a DNS server at all. When I want to access it over SSH from a Terminal on my Macbook Air (Yosemite), I can type:\n$ ssh myserver.local\n\nAnd that works fine. \nBut I wanted to avoid having to type the \".local\" domain every time, so I added the \"local\" domain to the Search Domains list in Network Settings (for my Wi-Fi adapter which is the one currently in use in my MBA).\nIf I then try:\n$ ssh myserver\n\nthat doesn't work (Could not resolve hostname).\nAny idea why?\n\nA: Hostname resolution in Mac OS X (since ~10.3) has roughly spoken - i exclude various cache mechanisms - the following operating sequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*'Files' (e.g. /etc/hosts) ->\n\n*mDNS ->  \n\n*DNS (search domains) ->  \n\n*DNS\n\n\nValid names for the different name resolution methods:  \nfor 1: almost arbitrary names\nfor 2: name.local\nfor 3: name (+ search.domain in your network prefs) A Start Of Authority (SOA) record for the top level domain is obligatory.\nfor 4: fqdn\nIn your first scenario (myserver.local) you only use 'Files' and mDNS. 'Files' fails because there is no entry myserver.local in your hosts file. mDNS succeeds resolving it because it's a valid and resolvable mDNS name.\nIn your second scenario (myserver & search.domain local) you use 1, 2, 3 (and 4). 'Files' fails because you have no entry myserver, mDNS fails because it's no valid mDNS name. DNS (search domains) fails because you don't have a DNS-server with a SOA record for .local in your network (as well as DNS).\nSo just enter sudo nano /etc/hosts in Terminal and add the line:\n a.x.y.z      myserver\n\n(a.x.y.z= IP-number of your server) and it should work. If you are really lazy even an 'a' as name might be sufficient. But don't use single numbers (like 1 or 123) because then ssh might try to connect to 0.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.123. At least ping connects to 0.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.123.\n\nA: @klanomath's answer explains perfectly how name resolution works, why your attempt did not and how you can create a pseudonym on your local machine for a static address through the /etc/hosts file.\nHowever, if myserver does not have a static address but rather is assigned one dynamically (e.g. by DHCP), then /etc/hosts is not ideal as one must find some way to keep the address therein updated.\nFor SSH, one can instead create an alias in /etc/ssh/ssh_config (system-wide) or ~/.ssh/config (user-specific):\nHost myserver\n    HostName myserver.local\n\nThen you can simply ssh myserver.\n", "Q: Text editor quotation mark woes In text editor my quotation marks keep getting replaced by non ascii versions.\nSo if I am editing an XML document the double vertical line type quotation mark keeps getting auto-replaced by the curly type that breaks the XML document.\nI have turned off the Text replacement option in preferences but it keeps happening.\n\nA: If you are using TextEdit, go to Preferences > New Document > Options and uncheck the box for smart quotes:\n\nYou may then require a system restart.\n", "Q: Macbook won't sleep with VGA monitor connected My macbook pro will not sleep with a VGA monitor connected, via a MiniDisplayport to VGA adapter. When I close the lid, all of the windows shift over to the second screen, and the light on the macbook continues to stay solid (rather than pulsing like it usually does when the monitor is not plugged in).\nI can unplug it, but it is a nuisance and I'm wondering if there's a way to fix it.\n\nA: I'm afraid that's the appropriate behaviour, and it's called Closed Clamshell or Closed Display mode.\nUsing the  Option+Command+Eject shortcut will  put the computer to sleep.\nOn the other hand, unplugging the Power Adapter from the MacBook and then closing the lid, will do the trick, too.\n\nA: The macbook will not go to sleep if an external monitor is connected. What you can do is put your mac in sleep with the following combination:\n\nCmd - option/alt - eject (on newer macs) \n  Cmd - option/alt - power button (on older macs)\n\n", "Q: Spotify Offline Mode: do I need to launch the app within 30 days? (when I'm online) If I use Spotify in Offline Mode on my iPad, I need to go online within 30 days or I will lose the offline songs.\nBut do I need to open the spotify app when the device does have internet connection, or can I just leave it close, and it will automatically inform the server?\nIn other words, do I need to take care about it and open the app when I do have connection, or this is done silently in background as soon as I connect to the internet (even with the app close) ?\n\nA: I think your misinterpreting the intent of that feature. Spotify offline mode basically forces your app to not connect to the Internet, in other words only the songs downloaded to your phone via the 'available offline' switch will play when the feature is enabled. After 30 days the next time you open the app it will disable the feature and connect to the Internet as normal. However, this does nothing to your music, it won't delete your downloaded songs or move it or touch it in any way, it just lets the app start up with internet connectivity allowing you to stream songs. I use this feature too and have no issues with it. \nEDIT straight from their website:\n\n", "Q: ipad music player crash The music player on my iPad iOS 8.1.2 has started crashing. After playing half a dozen songs or so the music player stops completely. This is very recent behaviour. Whether the music is downloaded or cloud does not make a difference. All music is in my iTunes account. \nI have rebooted the machine (let the battery run down to force a restart) but that has not fixed the music player. How can I restore normal music player function? \n\nA: You might need to isolate the problem further.\n\n\n*\n\n*Syncing with iTunes will rebuild the iTunes database files and potentially correct artwork problems.\n\n*playing new content might show that the existing content is in some way corrupt.\n\n*backing up the device and erasing all content and settings might be a more drastic step to get a clean song or two.\n\n\nIf that crashes, restore your device. If not, you can restore the backup and continue isolating things that will cause the crash. There's no update for iTunes, but perhaps you just need to wait for iOS 8.2 to arrive if it's not anything you are causing. The fact that multiple songs cause a crash means it's more likely about the database file storing the playlists and not just a bad song or two. Your comment about it happening with music that once played fine also points to settings and metadata and not the songs themselves.\n", "Q: Trying to restart a MacBook Pro that went off by itself with a battery that indicated \"Service Battery\"? My daughter's MacBook Pro (Late 2011 model) just went off while she was using it.\nBattery was reporting that it required servicing, so apparently, she was pushing it.\nAfter it went black, it would not turn on anymore, even though it said the battery was full (before it went off) and the charger was plugged in.\nNow when the charger is plugged in, the charge light flickers very faintly or is a constant faint green (really faint).  The charger is good because it can charge my son's MacBook Pro just fine and shows a bright orange while charging.\nWe've tried long power button holds to force a restart, but nothing seems to work.\n\nUpdate: MacBook Pro was brought to an Apple store. They swapped out the battery and put in a new Magsafe connector which they assumed might be faulty. Neither of those fixed the problem. So they suspected it was the Logic Board and said it needed to be sent out.\nThis MacBook Pro was sent out previously and received a logic board replacement earlier in 2014. Now it's potentially going to get another logic board replacement. We told the representative at the Mac service desk (aka Genius Bar?), and they said something about there not being a warranty on the logic board and they don't have a \"defined lifetime\". If it is a logic board, that will make it the third logic board that's been in this MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I woke up yesterday morning to this article in my newsfeed:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/man-fixes-laptop-by-putting-it-in-the-oven-2014-12\nWhen we replaced the first logic board, I had found that this is a widespread problem and people are trying to get Apple to address it.\nhttp://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/16/owners-of-late-2011-macbook-pros-report-critical-gpu-failures-system-crashes\nI will update this answer with what Apple comes back with when the laptop is returned from its second trip to the faraway fix up land.\n", "Q: Spotlight does not seem to work in finding apps I have a Spotlight to search for the applications.\n\nHowever, nothing shows up when I searched the application. \n\nWhat might be wrong?

The obvious candidate is called mdutil. You can use the -E flag to erase the local metadata store for the named drive(s), or -i off followed by -i on to turn indexing off, then on.

Great!\nIs there any keyboard shortcut that switches between full-screen windows on a single monitor?\n\nA: To summarize the set of keyboard shortcuts with the addition of @soulshined's input:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I have two windows from different apps I can switch with ⌘ Command-Tab.\n\n*If I have two windows from the same app I can switch with ⌘ Command-`.\n\n*If I have two full-screen windows from the same app then ⌘ Command-` doesn’t work, but I can switch with ⌃ Ctrl-← or → (or ⌃ Ctrl-← or →; I chose ⌃ Ctrl-← or → to\navoid conflict with browser back/forward shortcuts).\n\n*If I have two full-screen windows from the same app on different\nmonitors then ⌃ Ctrl-← or → doesn’t work but ⌘ Command-` does.\n\n*If I have two full-screen windows from the same app on different\nmonitors and the target window is currently not in front then ⌘ Command-` and ⌃ Ctrl-← or → both fail to work. I have to ⌘ Command-Tab to another app that is on the target monitor, then ⌃ Ctrl-← or →  to the target window. Correction: ⌃ Ctrl-← or → scrolls through spaces on the original monitor, not the target monitor, so there's actually no way to do this that I know of.\nAside: if I enable the keyboard shortcuts for “Switch to Desktop 1” and “Switch to Desktop 2” and use two monitors, the shortcuts won’t work if the specified desktop is not assigned to the current monitor.\nI've entered a usability bug with Apple, number 19363102.\n\nA: I have outlined below what you should do. In short, yes it is possible, because I use it everyday\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → 'Shortcuts' tab.\n\n*Click on the 'Mission Control' option in the left sidebar.\n\n*Now on the right sidebar you will see a Mission Control heading with a disclosure triangle next to it. Click on the triangle to show additional options.\n\n*You will see predefined options for you to select from; however, the keyboard shortcuts can be edited as necessary. I have mine set to Command-→ to switch between spaces.\n\n\nVisual aid:\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, it's because you don't have your displays segregated. If you're running more than one monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Mission Control and check 'Displays have separate Spaces'.\n\n*You will have to log out and log back in for it to take effect.\n\n\nAdditionally, for further desktop organization you can set your apps to only appear on a certain window or space, so that way that application only populates in the space you designate. You can do this by going to System Preferences → Mission Control and check \"Group windows by application\" so there isn't cluttering of applications.\nNOTE\nThis is not OS specific (works with Mavericks or Yosemite) and is not prejudiced to full screen apps. In other words, since you're switching spaces it doesn't matter what's in the space or how it's displayed; it will switch regardless. Lastly, it functions regardless of your screen output, setup, or format. I have three monitors and it only affects the active display. \n", "Q: External mic with iPhone and Bluetooth output I need some way to control iPhone 5 to allow me use a external microphone in the headphone 3,5mm socket and output my voice (in real time) to an external bluetooth speaker via the mobile Bluetooth system in the phone. In fact it’s like using a mobile phone as a PA system. Can anyone help?\n\nA: I found this app on App store that might suits your needs.\n\nMegaphone transforms your iPhone into an instant Microphone, PA system\n  or Megaphone when you plug it into amplified speakers.\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/megaphone-free/id304955183?mt=8\nAs you plug in external microphone your system should switch to that input, same for the Bluetooth speakers as output.\n\nA: No you cannot modify the white headphones you got. I'm assuming that your external mic is connected to some sort of audio panel right? If that's the case then you'll have to use an audio panel out to microphone in cable.\nOr if you want a direct connection to your iPhone you could try using something like this;\nhttp://www.canford.co.uk/Images/ItemImages/large/38-783_01.jpg\nAFAIK if you use something like the above image, the iPhone will detect that you're using the jack as microphone in and not mic+headset speakers So it will then reoptimize and choose your bluetooth speaker for sound out.\n\nA: [I think there is] only one way to use your iPhone and Bluetooth speakers, connect your iPhone to BT speakers, then call your iPhone with another phone and now this other phone becomes your wireless mic.\n\nA: There is an app called crowd mic that will allow you to use your phone as mic broadcast over PA system, wirelessly.\n\nA: I had the same problem. The mic on my ipad is dead, can't figure out why and how. I don't want to purchase that expensive adapter either, but I did have a bluetooth microphone laying around. I connect my ipad to the bluetooth mic, then in order to override the internal mic, I plug the white headphone into the jack. Somehow it works.\n", "Q: I would like to delete some photos from my phone camera roll, that i have imported to my Mac, will they stay on my Mac? I recently imported all my photos from my iPhone to my Mac. Now they are on both devices. I would like to delete some of them from my phone camera roll, but i want them to stay on my Mac. Will the photos/videos delete from both devices\n\nA: Yes, in short, you are safe. \nDepending on what software you are using, the only thing that could potentially happen is you delete your photo albums that you have synced to your iPhone, which is a manual process or you are syncing photos to your iPhone from your mac. However, since you stated you imported them, I don't foresee any issues. \nNOTE if you are referencing iCloud, then also, you have nothing to worry about. iCloud stores all the files in your iCloud but if you delete them from different devices it only deletes it from that device, unless you haven't had time to sync it to your Mac, but again, strictly importing, meaning you dragging and dropping or clicking the import to iPhoto/Aperture etc button, than you are good to go.\n", "Q: Yosemite OS: Turning a kext off and on -- consequences? Are there consequences to turning a kext on and off repeatedly?\nAlso, How can I check to make sure a specific kext is already on or off?\n\nA: I do not know how you turn kext on and off instead load and unload.\nBut, if you want to know current loaded kext's use Terminal.\nkextstat > ~/Desktop/kexts.txt\n\nThis will output a text file to your Desktop of currently active kext.\n", "Q: Yosemite OSX iMac reboot progress bar stuck at 50% My son went out of town and, upon returning, turned on his iMac.

I'm very technically inclined but don't know what to do about this issue.\nEDIT: So now things are getting worse as he tries rebooting and, after the start up sound, the computer powers down. \nEDIT2: I just learned that the computer was not turned off while he was away which leads me to believe the system tried to update itself and something went wrong causing some system files to not be found or, perhaps, the few things we tried to do to the system helped that along. \nSo we found out Apple will check out his system even though it's not under warranty and, if it can be fixed in the software, they'll also fix it for free. What a great company!\nEDIT3: Apple decided the hard drive had gone bad and replaced it. My son has a friend in the data recovery business who will attempt to extract the data.\n\nA: From your describe(\"progress bar typically showing during updates\"). sound like the system is updating and doing something. Click \"⌘L\" will show you installation log, you can check what's going on\n\nA: My son took the computer to the Apple store which found, through their testing, that the hard drive had gone bad and he replaced the drive.

Is there a better solution? Recently I was trying to train an Automator script to run some mundane tasks - unfortunately it stops at the first step.\nI clicked the \"record\" button on my old Mac OS 10.5 machine, opened Keychain and did a few more steps. It failed on the first step unfortunately - the cursor just points to the spot a little to the right of where Keychain shows on the bottom dock. (Yes, I tried turning off autohiding, and the jumpout effect)\nOn a newer Mac it was actually worse, when recording and playing back the steps it didn't give an alert saying it failed, it just kept pressing the mouse down, down, toward the icon, and never clicking it.\nIf Automator isn't the best tool for what it says it does, what is the best solution?\nSince this will be programmatically called, one natural choice might be the Java Robot class - unfortunately it seems this does simple key press, key-up, mouse movement, but doesn't seem to have the smarts Automator has.\nSikuli seems like possibly a good solution, but I can't test right now as it apparently only works on OS 10.6+ (and earlier than 10.10). It also sounds a bit hacky, how it uses image processing to find what you're looking for.\nI know there are OpenSSL commands that do the same as the Keychain, but for the purposes of this automation it has to be known by the system - which from what I can tell requires certs to be in the Keychain. I need a solution that can be scripted.\n\nA: You can add certs to a keychain with the command line tool security\nIt's been a while since I've used it, but IIRC the command would be:\nsecurity add-trusted-cert -r trustRoot -k /path/to/keychain /path/to/cert\nRead the man page:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html\n", "Q: How do I activate my old iPhone 4s?

Check your Mac model, click the Apple icon at the top left of your screen, choose About This Mac, then choose More Info.\nYou can't upgrade to an older version (unless you have a copy of the installer for that version).\n\nA: Mavericks / Yosemite are not updates to 10.6, they are new \"apps\".\nIn the App Store, search for \"Yosemite\", it should be the first result. mavericks is no longer offered directly but may be available by less obvious routes.\nAlso note that if you have an original Macbook Air it may not support the latest operating system.\n", "Q: Global keyboard shortcut to switch to an application (to use with Emacs/Aquamacs) Like in iTerm, I'd like to be able to set a keyboard shortcut to switch to an application, which in this case would be Aquamacs. This would be really useful to know in general. Would an Applescript or Automator let me do this?\n\nA: I tried to use specifically Applescript/Automator to avoid 3rd party applications, but eventually I utilised capabilities of application called Alfred (I can not recall right now, but there is a chance you should buy Alfred Power Pack to use this feature)\nIn addition with the help of Karabiner.app I forced CapsLock button to act as Shift+Cmd+Ctrl+Opt and there is almost no need to use Opt+Tab to switch between apps since then.\n\n", "Q: Projects between iMovie iPhone and iMovie OS X synchronised? I am trying to address the question here about transferring the videos between OS X and iOS from the iMovie perspective. Because iMovie is Apple product, I hope there is some easy synchronisation. There is iCloud in iMovie OSX but I cannot see it in iMovie iOS (iPhone 5) so I am worried that I am just wasting my times to work with projects requiring both iOS and OSX.\nIs it possible the get the iMovie projects synchronised between OSX and iOS?\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I transfer my iMovie project from iOS to OSX?\n\n\n*How can I move my iMovie OSX project to iOS?\n\n\nA: I think you should consider your possibilities.\nThe iOS iMovie version is greatly limited in capacity, not to mention disk space, compared to its sister application.\nYou can share 'projects' via iMovie theater, however I use that term loosely. Going back to practicality, if you share a complete project and sync it to your mobile device and lets say this mobile device only has 16GB HDD and you only have a 5GB iCloud storage locker than you will quickly run out of room in easily half of 1 project. With that being said, going back to the mobile devices capabilities, it doesn't have all the features your desktop version has so some things get lost in translation, you may lose a transition you set prior, etc. However, it is a resource to share projects nonetheless. Additionally, the main draw back of iMovie Theater is that it doesn't share the PROJECT thats why I was using that term 'loosely', it shares the entire project movie with it's components (i.e., background music etc) that you have created thus far or the selection of the project you dictate. Theoretically, you can download the iMovie project from the theatre to your device and create a new project on your iPhone where you can add clips and edit there. But you won't be able to edit the properties in the previous project.\nWhat I recommend you doing if your going full scale with this, two of the better options I would recommend is :\n\n*\n\n*Get a Time Capsule, you can set it up to wake over WLAN and essentially use it as both a router and external HDD which files you can access from anywhere. Although, this isn't an iOS friendly option, it's a logical option, because why waste your time creating on an iOS when the features are limited and the projects are decapitated from your devices hardware.\n\n*Dropbox, Box, Google Drive etc etc etc. Use a file sharing cloud service to where you can simply save the project there from the get go and edit through that file instead of any of your devices HDD (unless your planning on doing some high processing features in FCPX with rendering etc) then that is a viable option.\n\n*Don't use iMovie. It's great and all, but look at its target audience, it's meant for the people that don't have much expertise or the attention span to sit and edit videos, it's one-click and done type editing.\n\n*Just get a laptop and save yourself a lot of heartache.\n\nBut to answer your question specifically and without bias, then NO, in regards to iMovie Mac and iMovie iOS you can not sync projects where full functionality is retained.\n\nA: According to this review, with recent versions of iMovie, iOS and OS X you can use AirDrop to \"share\" a whole project from iMovie on iOS to iMovie on OS X, as well as using the Theatre to share individual clips (original media or finished products).\nRequirements will include:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.9+ (maybe 10.10?)\n\n*iOS 8+\n\n*Mac and iPhone which both support AirDrop\n\n*iMovie 10+\n\n\nNote: this feature was temporarily removed (sounds like they updated the format for iMovie for iOS projects but haven't added support in iMovie for Mac), so may only work on iMovie for iOS up to some particular version (sorry don't know which). Presumably will continue to work again soon...!\n", "Q: How to determine where the localhost:8080 source and server are located I am running Mavericks OS currently on my iMac. It has been a while since I set up a web server on my iMac. I went to my Firefox browser and went to localhost:8080 and it returns a simple string \"SUCCESS\". How can I determine what server is responsible for this and where the source file is located? I have searched multiple locations and can't find it's location. I have looked at /etc/apache2/sites/...conf file and it shows /Users/(me)/Sites but the index.html located there is not what I'm seeing. I would expect that to be on port 80 anyway and it won't load, suggesting that the apache server were running, which I'm pretty sure is not, based on  the Activity Monitor.\nI don't recall how the server was started. I have been dabbling with nodejs but not sure which project is involved with this. Is there a way to track this down and control the server and the webroot code located there?\n\nA: Try:\nsudo  lsof -n -i :8080 -s TCP:LISTEN\n\nThe first two columns will be the name and PID of the process(es) listening on port 8080.\nUse the PID to find it in Activity Monitor, Get Info, and notice which files it has open. It'll have a bunch of libraries open, but high on the list will be the executable file.\nAlternatively, from the name, see what service it corresponds to with\nsudo launchctl list | grep theprocessname\n\nFor example, if the name were httpd, the above command would tell you the service name is org.apache.httpd. If you don't get any hits (because it's not running as a daemon), try it without sudo.\nAsk launchctl for more info about that service. Continuing to use Apache as the example:\nsudo launchctl list org.apache.httpd\n\nwould tell you\n{\n    \"LimitLoadToSessionType\" = \"System\";\n    \"Label\" = \"org.apache.httpd\";\n    \"TimeOut\" = 30;\n    \"OnDemand\" = false;\n    \"LastExitStatus\" = 0;\n    \"PID\" = 39660;\n    \"Program\" = \"/usr/sbin/httpd\";\n    \"ProgramArguments\" = (\n        \"/usr/sbin/httpd\";\n        \"-D\";\n        \"FOREGROUND\";\n    );\n};\n\nNotice the \"Program\" line, which gives you the path to the executable. Most of that information comes from /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.apache.httpd.plist, which is the file that tells Launch Services when to run the program and how.\nYour web server, listening on port 8080, is not from Apple, so it won't be in /System/Library. Look in /Library/LaunchDaemons, or maybe even in ~/Library/LaunchAgents (if it runs only when you're logged in). (Listening on port 8080 does not require root privilege, so it could conceivably be running as you, although that has interesting security implications.)\nAnother place to look is in System Preferences→Users & Groups→Login Items. Since we don't know how you set it up to run automatically, it might be that you didn't do it by putting a file in any of the ...Library/Launch* directories.\n", "Q: Playing AVI file with XviD codec crashes my VLC and doesn't play on quick time I got a video file with an avi extension, and this is its technical description:\n VIDEO: 1300 kbps XviD               \n RESOLUTiON: 720x304                           \n AUDIO: 256 CBR AC-3        \n NOTES: Converted to XviD.\n AAC to AC3.\n\nWhen I play it on itunes It gives me this error:\n\nClicking on the tell me more button I go to this link which states:\n\nQuickTime Player plays Motion JPEG-based AVIs created by many digital cameras.

So if for example I'm closing a window in the background, I completely lose focus of where I was before.\nAny way to rectify this annoyance?\n\nA: macOS is an application-centric model (by most recently used), whilst Windows uses a window-centric model (by z-order).\nRead more: https://www.isotoma.com/blog/2010/05/10/solving-the-real-alt-tab-problem/\nYou can use a number of third-party apps to make macOS use a window-centric model, see the answers to this question for some examples.\n\nA: I may not understand your issue, but you can close any application even if (in coding terminology) it is not the 'frontmost application', just like you can scroll any window without it being the active window. \nFor example I have Safari open and that's what i'm currently active with and working in.  I want to close iMove while retaining Safari as the frontmost application. You simply just click on the x button of iMovie without even making it an active application, it will close the window NOT QUIT the application. \nSo, in the scope of your question, if we go back to my example of using Safari, and i have two windows or tabs open and I use the keyboard shortcut command + w or otherwise to close the most active window, because the Application is the frontmost application it will automatically go to the next window of that application to retain intuitive workflow that apple so much loves. \nI can't duplicate your error, so it must be a user-end issue. Chrome can't tell your OS how to operate, it can just navigate it's resources. \nHow are you closing it is the question? Keyboard Shortcut? Clicking the x without making it active? Additionally, where are you closing it could cause the problem, if your closing a full screen window then again, it's automatically going to go to the next most forefront window of that application since its the most active application.

I used iTunes to create a backup for it.\nI just got an iPhone 5S (also running iOS 8.1.2), and I restored the 4S backup onto it. However none of the voicemails on the 4S were restored in the process.\nI entered my voicemail password on the 5S and it didn't download any voicemails.  Apparently AT&T doesn't keep voicemails on their servers after you download them.\nAll the voicemails are still saved on the 4S. Is there any way to transfer those voicemails onto the 5S?\n\nA: I think we’ve established that at the time this question was asked, you were left at the mercy of your carrier. There were workarounds, such as plugging an AUX cable into a computer and recording those voicemails, but many of them were rather cumbersome or lossy (or they cost money).\nThankfully, starting with iOS 9, Apple added the option to convert Voicemails to Voice Memos (on carriers that support Visual Voicemail).\nSimply open the Share Sheet on a voicemail you want to save, then select Voice Memos.\n\nVoice Memos are supposed to sync via iCloud (although my results have been spotty with that one), and my experience has been that they get included in your iTunes and iCloud backups as well.\nYou can also save your voicemails to iCloud Drive, AirDrop them from your old iPhone to your new (although that requires at least an iPhone 5), etc.\nI don’t know how relevant this question still is to the OP, but if they kept their old iPhone 4s, it is eligible to upgrade to iOS 9, and therefore transfer those voicemails that have been sitting around all this time.\n\nA: See what you can access Here\nYou may be in trouble if AT&T isn't automatically displaying them. I have in the past been saved by them, where it auto-populatd all my voicemails after upgrading my phone. However, I also know from personal experience that saved or deleted messages aren't retained after a threshold, but they are retained in your backup. However, i'm not sure your end goal isn't possible without a backup, i know you can save them to your computer, but retransferring them back to your phone as a voicemail will not happen. Why your voicemails weren't restored is a complexity of it's own. It's part of the core backup process so why it was omitted in the restore? who knows \nRegardless, there are tutorials out there that can get your through locating your backup references. but I suggest you save your own personal time, and if it's worth the money get a third party app that will take care of all the hard work in transferring them as audible audio files you can play on all audio players. The only reason I know is because my grandpap passed away and I wanted to save a voice mail that got lost in translation of upgrading so I downloaded iExplorer. Handles all the heavy work for you, but unfortunately it costs money. I'm sure years after my incident there are widely more available options that are free\n", "Q: Who is able to access iMessage on Apple's servers? I understand that iMessages are stored on Apple's servers regardless of whether my iCloud is switched on or not.\nCan the messages stored on Apple's servers be accessed either by myself, or by anyone else using my AppleID? I am concerned that other people may be able to access these messages.\n\nA: See iOS Security, pp30–32:\n\niMessage\nApple iMessage is a messaging service for iOS devices and Mac computers. iMessage supports text and attachments such as photos, contacts, and locations. Messages appear on all of a user’s registered devices so that a conversation can be continued from any of the user’s devices. iMessage makes extensive use of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Apple does not log messages or attachments, and their contents are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt the data.\nWhen a user turns on iMessage, the device generates two pairs of keys for use with the service: an RSA 1280-bit key for encryption and an ECDSA 256-bit key for signing. For each key pair, the private keys are saved in the device’s keychain and the public keys are sent to Apple’s directory service (IDS), where they are associated with the user’s phone number or email address, along with the device’s APNs address.\nAs users enable additional devices for use with iMessage, their public keys, APNs addresses, and associated phone numbers are added to the directory service. Users can also add more email addresses, which will be verified by sending a confirmation link. Phone numbers are verified by the carrier network and SIM. Further, all of the user’s registered devices display an alert message when a new device, phone number, or email address is added.\nHow iMessage sends and receives messages\nUsers start a new iMessage conversation by entering an address or name. If they enter a phone number or email address, the device contacts the IDS to retrieve the public keys and APNs addresses for all of the devices associated with the addressee. If the user enters a name, the device first utilizes the user’s Contacts app to gather the phone numbers and email addresses associated with that name, then gets the public keys and APNs addresses from the IDS.\nThe user’s outgoing message is individually encrypted using AES-128 in CTR mode for each of the recipient’s devices, signed using the sender’s private key, and then dispatched to the APNs for delivery. Metadata, such as the timestamp and APNs routing information, is not encrypted. Communication with APNs is encrypted using TLS.\nIf the message text is too long, or if an attachment such as a photo is included, the attachment is encrypted using a random key and uploaded to iCloud. The key and URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for the attachment are encrypted and signed, as shown below.\n\nFor group conversations, this process is repeated for each recipient and their devices.\nOn the receiving side, each device receives its copy of the message from APNs, and, if\n  necessary, retrieves the attachment from iCloud. The incoming phone number or email\n  address of the sender is matched to the receiver’s contacts so that a name can be\n  displayed, if possible.\nAs with all push notifications, the message is deleted from APNs when it is delivered.\n  Unlike other APNs notifications, however, iMessage messages are queued for delivery\n  to offline devices. Messages are stored for up to seven days.\n\nIf implemented properly, this means that your messages on Apple's servers can only be decrypted by devices that you registered with Apple for iMessage before they were sent.  Furthermore, you must connect the device to Apple's push service within 7 days of message transmission or else the messages will be purged.\nHowever, that is a big \"if\":\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no independent audit of Apple's codebase, so the devices that you and your correspondents use might contain \"backdoors\" (deliberate or otherwise) e.g. weaknesses in key generation or information leakage through covert channels—and that's assuming the devices themselves are \"secure\";\n\n*There is no way that your correspondents can verify that the discovered public keys (received from Apple's directory) are actually paired with the private keys you hold on your devices—Apple could substitute them for those of a \"man in the middle\" or simply add an additional public key for a device that you do not own but which will then be able to decrypt all messages destined for you (you can attempt to detect such attacks by querying for your public keys from another account and verifying the response, although there is still no guarantee that Apple aren't providing a different response to other parties);\n\n*As always, security is only as good as the weakest link: your correspondents have full, unencrypted access to your conversations and any compromise of them or their devices would lead to a total compromise of your communication.\n\nA: Actually, during the whole Privacy snafu thanks to Edward Snowden, iMessage has proved resilient and one of the better encrypted workflows according to NSA. the NSA even took it to the government asking them to force Apple to dumb down its protocols so it's not so effective. However, if you are using iMessage on your Mac then there is an option that allows you to save conversations to your desktop. You can disable this feature anytime. Pertaining to your phone put a passcode on it. When backing it up make sure your backups are encrypted. This will require a password when restoring the backup. Otherwise, there's only so much you can do in the realm of today's technology to keep a firewall of protection active. But iMessage is fairly safe in that scope of dependency. \n", "Q: Disk Images no longer show up in Finder's Sidebar I've been dealing with an issue for a very long time, I feel like it used to be a problem randomly, but at least for the last few months it's persistent.

You can see that I have a DMG for Clementine open, and Disk Utility confirms that. But the volume isn't showing up on the sidebar. You can also see that the Devices list is expanded, listing my built in volume.\nI've done some light searching of options to see if it could be controlled by a plist defaults setting, but I haven't found anything yet.\nWhy aren't mounted volumes showing up on the sidebar? How can I restore them in the list?\nThis problem began under Mavericks, and has persisted in Yosemite.\n\nA: Update.\nJust realised that it the CDS,DVDS,  and iPod option in the Finder side bar prefs control  showing of DMGs\n\nYou need to check it to get them to show up.\n\nThe below may be related to External drives not showing up.\n\nIf you drag them of the sidebar they will never show up even when mounted.\nTo get them back you need to mount them and drag them back on.\nThis may not be what is going on with your if this is happening to any new items you have never mounted before. But you could try this and see.\n\nHere for illustration a Partition and a DMG being dragged off. \n(But this has happened to me without me realising or for some unknown reason.)\n\n\n\nTo get them back I would need to drag them back.\nI go to my device window:\n\nAnd drag them back to the side bar\n\n\n\nAnd now they are back.\n\n\nA: i am on mojave. \nnothing of the above worked for me.\nin order to have the disk images appear in the sidebar when opening a DMG file, i deleted the preferences of finder (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist) and sidebar (same folder, file com.apple.sidebarlists.plist). \nplease note that i had various com.apple.finder.plist files, with the base-name completed by random alphanumeric sequences: com.apple.finder.plist.QNHART6 and the like. i had to delete of all of these com.apple.finder.plist files. after what the behavior was again that when clicking ot oen a DMG file, the disk image appears in the sidebar.\n", "Q: How to subscript/superscript single character in Text Edit? I would like to know how to subscript/superscript \"single\" character in Text Edit.\nI have followed this question: Entering superscript text (exponents) in TextEdit?, which is format-font-baseline-Subscript\nbut it subscripts/superscripts single line, even if I highlight single character. I tried to use different fonts, but it seems like I cannot select single character and then subscript/superscript it. Thank you for every answer.\n\nA: The problem was that I had plain text turned on, instead of rich text . ( Format-Make Rich text ).\nI don't know if plain text is the default option or not, but when you have plain text you can't use subscript/superscript single characters, it just applies the transformation to the whole line. Surprisingly, when you subscript something in rich text and then switch back to plain text, you get this popup:    Making a rich text document plain will lose all text styles (such as fonts and colors), images, attachments, and document properties.\nI just don't get why these unsupported operations aren't greyed out when they don't work properly. \n", "Q: Where to find the Yosemite traffic light icons? Where would I be able to acquire Yosemite's new \"traffic light\" icons? I have found the SystemAppearance.car file, but I do not know how to decompress .car files, or if the file even contains the icons.\n\nA: .car file is special BOM file and the file specification is un-document by apple, this is simulator with Assert.car in iOS. \nI found an open source project ThemeEngine\nPS: I don't test it anymore.\n", "Q: Cannot download app from family sharing (app already downloaded) I have recently configured Family Sharing (2 accounts are currently part of it). Most of the apps download just fine, but there are some exceptions.\nExample: account A has Twitter in its purchased list; if account B tries to download Twitter from the store, the little cloud icon appears (and this is expected, since the app has indeed been downloaded by a family member already), but the download fails with an error message that says that the app has already been purchased by another user.\nIs there a way to solve this?\n\nA: Ok I found a solution, it's another iOS 8 bug. These are the steps to solve this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Launch the App Store on your iOS device.\n  \n*Select the \"Featured\" tab and scroll to the bottom.\n  \n*Tap on your Apple ID and select \"Sign Out.\"\n  \n*Tap on \"Sign In\" and log in with your Apple ID.\n  \n\nSource\n", "Q: Recover data after reinstalling OS X? I was wondering if there is a way to recover photos and things alike from a MacBook after reinstalling the OS X.\nLike when you reinstall Windows there is the \"Windows.old\" folder and you can recover some of the data from there.\n\nA: The Apple installer does not erase the disk unless you tell it to - that involves opening Disk Utility. So your files are fairly likely to still be there in the Users folder, just under your old user name.\nHowever, you said \"She used the installation CD\" - you have old hardware running OS X.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier? those versions DID have an \"erase and install\" option.\nOf course, the easiest way is to simply recover the files from yesterday's backup that you of course have on an external drive.\n\nA: I'm afraid no such thing exists in Mac OS X.\nYou could try recovering the information you want using software like TestDisk, although might be difficult to recover if you're using a SSD drive or you did a Secure Erase.\n\nA: After searching for some hours I found a program which can recover files.\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\nYou select which hard-drive will try to recover data, the format in which files are saved in that disk,...\nAlso you can select which types of files you want to get. For example .jpg. The program will look for files in the hard-drive which have the header for the .jpg and will save them in a folder.\nThe only bad thing is that it recovers also program icons and everything so you will have +30k photos which you won't need.\n", "Q: keyboard issues I currently have Yosemite and I am new to mac. \nI have an issue with my keyboard. I tried to look under preferences of the keyboard but couldn't find the proper virtual keyboard matching my actual keyboard which means that not all my real keys correspond. I am playing a guessing game to figure out where \"à\" is for example. My actual letters are good but not the rest (punctuation, etc...)\nThe last thing is the continuous shift key. It doesn't \"capitalize\" mu numbers which means that i need to keep pressing shift at the same time I am writing numbers. Is that a mac feature or can I change it? It's annoying if I have to write series of numbers...\nThank you \n\nA: I have the same issue than Nidale except that my physical keyboard layout is correct according to the APPLE's layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*AZERTY physical keyboard\n\n*Configure as French Numerical (so  123 underneath the french flag icon)\n\n\nThe issue was solved simply by clicking on the flag in the menu bar and choosing the same keyboard layout as Tom asked to add (french flag with 123 underneath).\nThe keyboard layout set when you open a document (or an app) will stay the same until you change it manually. If you want to use the numerical layout you need to choose it as default and then close all your apps/documents or relog/reboot (even better).\n\nA: 1 I really don't know which \"Alter sound\" you have heard, it's really hard to guess\n2 do you want to type \"à\"? US_en keyboard layout you can type and hold \"a\" key and you can see a popup menu \n3 which keyboard layout do you use?  \n\nA: To have the numbers stay when you do Caps Lock, go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and use the plus and add buttons to activate the French Numerical layout, then select that one in the \"flag\" menu at the top right of the screen.\n", "Q: How to remove known networks from Mac? I wanted to try the solution from there (and many other sites point to this solution) but the preferred network list and all the buttons (shown in the step 4) are greyed out on my Mac (10.9.5). \nHow do I remove a known network from my Mac?\n\nA: *\n\n*Just unlock (bottom left) the network prefs before hitting the advanced button.\n\n*You have to enter a login name with admin rights and the respective password to do so. If it's your personal Mac usually the one and only existing account has admin rights (though the login name doesn't contain 'Admin'). An office/school/university Mac has - depending on the internal guidelines - often several accounts: non-privileged standard user accounts and one or several admin accounts. Only the admin accounts are eligible to change network preferences.\n\n*Choose your WIFI-interface and click the advanced button\n\n*Remove any unwanted networks\n", "Q: Screen sharing with windows 8.1 - observe windows screen on mac Here are already some questions about how to connect to mac's screen from windows, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*screen sharing from Windows to Mac over LAN\n\n*Screen Sharing from windows to mac with no software on the windows computer\nI'm looking for a reverse way.

You can try both and see which works best for you.\n1) you can install VNC for Windows (there are several versions) on her machine\nMost are free and should work with the OSX vnc client application. I haven't use it so I can't say more. As long as they on the same network you should not have any problems. Over the internet, things get complicated...\n2) install a free (for personal use) application like TeamViewer.\nI prefer Teamviewer as it is simpler and it will work from anywhere in the world with a semi decent connection. There are several other applications like this out there but I've used it for years and I've come to trust it.\nThe other good thing about TeamViewer is that once her machine has it installed (and password protect it), it will get an numeric ID that should not change. Open an account with TeamViewer.com and save her ID there. Then anywhere in the world you can find her machine and share her screen. Neat no?\n\nHope that helped.\n\nA: you can install Microsoft remote desktop for mac, this app can access the windows pc desktop remotely. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12\n", "Q: Managing Virtual Macs on a closed network I have a lab of VMWare virtual Macs on a network with no Internet access.  What options do i have for managing these Macs, other than one at a time?  I am looking at ARD and JAMF at the moment...\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop turns out to be the answer.  It is important that ARD have a separate administrative user account, and I recommend that the account be hidden from users' view.  \n", "Q: Find Mac's \"age\" in Yosemite I upgraded a Mac to OS X Yosemite and would like to find the age (when it's been released). In previous OS it was given here:\n\nbut I can't find it in Yosemite there\n\n...anyone?\n\nA: It should be right under the the OS X Yosemite.  Checked 3 different models and all showed in the same place.\n\n\nA: Or, on the same window, you can go to the Support tab and click Specifications to get even more information.\n\n\nA: You could also check for your device or any other device when you have the serial number at \nselfsolfe.apple.com\n", "Q: Trigger function key using AppleScript I'm trying to trigger a function key using applescript. I need it to press the 'volume up' key with fn.\nI wrote the following AppleScript but it isn't effective:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key down 63 -- fn\n    key code 111 -- f12\n    key up 63\nend tell\n\njust executing key code 111 gives me the same result as the code above, \n key down 63 \n\ndoesn't seem to effect the behaviour of the script, the f12 key is being pressed, without the function modifier.\nIs there anything like \n using function down / using fn down\n\njust like there is for the command key\n using command down\n\nor is there any other way to achieve this?\n\nA: if you are trying to set the volume in AppleScript a correct syntax would be as the following, no need to force button presses :\ntell application \"System Events\"\nset volume 4\nend tell\n\nNow as you can see its a forced process. If you want more flexibility like determining where the users volume is currently at or set it to increment increase/decrease by 1, yes it's possible, but a little more code heavy than i can manage right now (i'm typing from my iPhone) \nHowever, \nIf at possible, and your end goal wouldn't be affected by using Automator. I would use Automator if I was you, it has built in functions like this with easy drag and drop motives. 'Set Computer Volume is one of them'. But thats an alternative, I just emulated that with the code above. \n", "Q: Calendar does not show event times in month view after Yosemite download Calendar does not show times in month view, and there is no box on Preferences to Show Times in Month View, as some have said there is.\n\nA: The pref for Event Times in Month View disappeared with Mavericks.\nMake the window large enough & they will automatically show.\n … or ...\n\nA: if your speaking in reference to iCal then you can't. Just in Week and Day View. If you are using iCal and you have an event for the whole day there is no need to show the hours right, because you know it's an all day process. iCal determines that by putting those events at the top of the list in the day of the month. BUT If you have an event that is set by time, it will show in the right detail section the time your event starts, see picture below. However, if events overlap, say there is a coffee party before my 5k Run that runs until 9:30 there is no way to decipher that without clicking on the event to show the details of the event. Even though it will list Coffee Party before the 5k since it starts before you just won't know it overlaps. Everything is in chronological order. Your simply stuck with what Apple provides in this case.\n\n", "Q: Creating NetRestore on 10.10.1 failing When trying to create a NetRestore image in SIU on 10.10.1 and trying to add custom packages the build will always fail with Error Code 2.\nI noticed when you try to Customize Packages that \"Essential System Software\" reads as 8.03TB but the SSD inside the computer is only 256GB. \nI have tried to redownload the \"Install OS X Yosemite\" from the Mac App Store three times and with all 3 sources the \"Essential System Software\" will still always read as 8.03TB.\nDoes anyone else experience this and know how to resolve this?\n\nA: 'Customize Package Selection' is only valid for NetInstall images and not for NetRestore images - at least for Mavericks.  \nSource\nProbably it's the same for Yosemite. I haven't a source for that though.\nOn the other hand 'NetRestore' just uses an already prepared image of a working OS X installation - so absolutely nothing to customize afterwards...\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Air keep restarting because of a problem?

The panic report references the kernel extension \"ng.uds.netusb.controller\".\nIf so, either look for an updated software package for the USB network adapter, or uninstall the software.\n\nA: If I had to guess just based on what you've posted, I would guess you may be looking at either a hardware incompatibility or hardware failure. First, try booting without any external devices attached. If you still get kernel panics like this, try the Apple Hardware Test suite: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257\nFinally, make sure your laptop has good ventilation and is not overheating.\n\nA: Try doing an SMC reset (http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295) and see if the issue persists.

I have a 2011 MacBookPro running OS X Yosemite. I was browsing online when suddenly my entire screen went grey (no cursor, completely unresponsive). I restarted the laptop & got the usual \"Update Needed\" user (I have FileVault on). As soon as it reaches halfway thru the progress bar, it reboots on its own! I tried resetting the SMC, as well as holding down Cmd + R to access recovery. In the latter case, the Apple logo appears with a progress bar underneath. As soon as it reaches halfway thru, the screen turns grey & it just sits there. The same thing happens when I try to boot into safe mode.\nTried many times unsuccessfully. I have a feeling this has to do with FileVault.\nHelp!\n\nA: Turns out my 2011 MacBook Pro is one of several units suffering from a defective GPU.\nI realized this issue happens only when I'm doing something GPU-related like using iPhoto or viewing certain webpages.

Inside that folder you'll see all of the user accounts for that Windows computer.  Copy the user you want over to a flash drive or external hard drive then plug it into your laptop.  On your Mac, use the Migration Assistant to finish the transfer or just copy and paste the files yourself.\n\nA: Macs are able to read NTFS file systems (the kind used by Windows) but are not able to write to them by default. You should be able to transfer the data over as you would normally. If you want both read and write access from both a windows and a mac machine, consider using a more advanced file system like ExFAT.\nIf your current External Hard Drive is formatted as NTFS, you can reformat it in either windows or a mac environment as ExFAT, however this will delete all the data on the drive. \nIf the intended goal is simply to transfer to the new mac, this could be achievable in NTFS or ExFAT. I would recommend transferring the files to your mac, and then re-formatting the drive as ExFAT, so both operating systems can read and write to it.\n", "Q: Getting MAC Address from known network I lost my old router, and I need to know its MAC address, only info i got is the log of my Mac (Yosemite), i have found that with this command i got a lot of info about the preferred networks (saved networks) on my Mac.\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences KnownNetworks\n\nAnd it outputs something like:\n\"wifi.ssid.<77696669 2d756e65>\" =     {\n    AutoLogin = 0;\n    Captive = 0;\n    ChannelHistory =         (\n    );\n    Closed = 0;\n    CollocatedGroup =         (\n    );\n    Disabled = 0;\n    LastConnected = \"2014-09-19 19:20:23 +0000\";\n    Passpoint = 0;\n    PossiblyHiddenNetwork = 0;\n    RoamingProfileType = None;\n    SPRoaming = 0;\n    SSID = <77696669 2d756e65>;\n    SSIDString = \"heeeyomywifi\";\n    SecurityType = Open;\n    SystemMode = 1;\n    TemporarilyDisabled = 0;\n};\n\nBut i see no MAC address :(, could this be done? or shall I search somewhere else?\n\nA: Pending how long was the last connection, you could find the answer in your Console log.\nI have it showing the information for last 7 days.

I want to make sure that the old (Mavericks) backup never gets automatically erased; if there isn't enough space on the backup disk I want the backup to fail, not overwrite the old one. How can I be sure that it won't be deleted? Would it be safe to move the Mavericks backup out of Backups.backupdb? Ideally, I'd be able to treat it as a second machine. In the linked question com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist is mentioned; it would be nice to generate a new one.\n\nA: You've already done it. By erasing the disk you changed its UUID, so TM already considers the new disk completely unrelated to the old one.\nThe only problem you may run into is that if you ever do a full-disk restore from one of your old backups, TM will patch things up so that the restored disk (which now has yet a third UUID) is considered the one that all the old backups were from. It will now be the new backups that it won't ever erase.\nWhich come to think of it is probably exactly what you want.\nIn case that's confusing, let's take a specific example. You have a disk with UUID#1, and in March you begin letting let TM make a bunch of snapshots with it. TM remembers that they're snapshots of UUID#1. Then in June you erase the disk, so that it now has UUID#2 and let TM start taking snapshots of it. TM regards your snapshots from June onward to be snapshots of a different disk from a different computer. It won't touch the March-April snapshots.\nThen in August you do a full-disk restore from one of your April snapshots. Part of a full-disk restore is to erase the disk, so it now has UUID#3. But at the end of the restore, TM will patch up the backup so that the March-April snapshots now appear to have been of the disk with UUID#3. The May-June snapshots, of the disk with UUID#2, are now the protected ones that TM will not touch.\nPersonally, though, I'd let TM start backing up to a new disk. That makes it easier for you to keep track of which backup is of which disk, and reduces the risk that you'll lose the old backups to a drive failure. Drive failure seems to be the biggest threat to a TM backup. If you aren't using the old backups, you don't need to have them mounted all the time.\n", "Q: Does adding Yosemite Tags to a File change its MD5 Signature? I have a cloud backup system that relies on MD5 hash signatures for de-duplication.\nDoes adding OSX tags to a file change its MD5 hash?\nEDIT: I did some testing and got mixed results depending on the filetype/app used. So not sure if the tag itself is making a difference or something else change by the app. \n\nA: I ran md5 file in Terminal.app, applied a tag to file, and re-ran md5. The hash returned was the same. Without knowing your exact setup it's impossible to know for sure, but it looks like you're OK.\n\nA: One thing I thought of that might affect the outcome is which tags you're adding, and how. The traditional label colors (Red, Orange, ...) are stored in a 3-bit subfield of the FinderInfo field of the HFS+ catalog record for the file. The new labels are stored instead in an extended attribute of the file.\nUnder the new scheme, if Finder sets the tag, it always puts it (or them) in the com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags extended attribute. If some other application sets the label index, for example with the AppleScript command\ntell application \"Finder\" to set label index of someFile to 3\n\nthe label index is set in FinderInfo. A non-zero value for FinderInfo causes the xattr command to list it as if it were the extended attribute com.apple.FinderInfo, where you can see the label index as three of the bits in the tenth byte. The interaction between these two fields is complex. Sometimes modifying one will clear the other, sometimes not.\nmd5 might be affected differently depending on what metadata, if any, is included in the checksum versus which metadata is affected by the method you use to set the label.\nThe good news is that md5 appears to ignore all metadata. It computes a checksum of only the data fork. It doesn't even incorporate the resource fork. (To checksum the resource fork, you have to explicitly ask for it, as in md5 \"Icon^M\"/..namedfork/rsrc, but then the resource fork is the only thing it looks at.)\n", "Q: Is the MacBook designed to hang from its display? I am looking admiringly at the roost for my 17\" MacBook Pro.\nThe height to which the MacBook is raised is terrific—higher than any other solution I'm able to locate online (also here and there). The promise of less strain on my neck is appealing. Since I'm looking for a portable solution (hence three phone books do not do the trick), the roost's weight is also appealing.\nMy problem is that this device does not seat the laptop. It hangs it from its display. I am not particularly tempted to pick up my mac from its display, nor to pick it and then let it hang there for hours on end. I suspect there will be considerable strain on the hinges, and I can already feel a minor bump where my thumb, ever so gently, opens the display, from merely the pull of the magnets, not to mention the potential damage to the screen (a single replacement part from Apple).\nIs there any specification from Apple that the MacBook Pro is designed to withstand its own weight (6.6 lb; 3 Kg) through its display and hinges? Is doing so counter-specified? Lacking either, have you actually hung your 6.6-lb laptop from this device since its introduction in early 2014? Did the display survive?\nUpdate Hooray! There is a new design.\nUpdate2 There is a worthy competitor in the field, but it's not portable.\n\nA: I would venture that this is not an endorsed way of mounting a laptop.  Holding an LCD by its housing can cause potential problems with the hinges, as well as pressure marks.  It's also possible to crack the metal as it's really thin around the screen.\nAny sort of damage resulting from the use of such a device would most likely be deemed accidental and not covered by your warranty.\nYou should ask Apple what their official policy is if you're hell-bent on using this.\n", "Q: iOS 8.1.2 Calendar Timezone Problem I use my calendars very often to keep track of things.  Ever since I upgraded to iOS 8.1.2 (or possibly 8.1.1) the phone lets me create a new event with my timezone, but as soon as I create the event and try to edit it, the times are converted to GST (which is not my timezone).\nIs there a way to fix or disable this so that iPhone Calendar is easier to use like before?\n\nA: Go to Settings/General/Date and Time.\nChoose Set Automatically and choose your Time Zone.\nNext go to Settings/Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. Page down to the Calendars section.\nSet Time Zone Override to OFF if you want you calendar to display with times converted to the Time Zone where you are currently standing.\nOr, set Time Zone Override to ON if you want to force the times in your calendar to be displayed in the home Time Zone that you set above.\n", "Q: Is it possible to take a screenshot of a dashboard in OS X? I'm using a  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  command to take a screenshot of a desktop, but it doesn't work if I switch to the dashboard. \nIs there any way to take a screenshot of dashboard elements? \n\nA: I'm assuming you set up  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  yourself, as it's not a System default.\nIf you use  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  then you can drag a marquee round the item you want, or even use  Space  afterwards to grab the entire floating widget, examples below…\n\n\n*\n\n*Using  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4 \nNote the hard edges & visible background.\n\n\n*Using  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4   followed by  Space  then clicking the desired 'window'/widget.\nNote the soft edges with shadows\n\n", "Q: Disable citrix receiver startup on login I have installed citrix receiver on my home macbook.  It auto starts on login yet it does not show an entry in the Login Items tab under the Users and Groups pane of System Preferences.  How can I disable the service from starting on login?\n\nA: Creating an app in Automator with shell script works fine to unload at startup without removing the plist files.\nYou have to add :\nlaunchctl unload –w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac.plist \nlaunchctl unload –w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist \nlaunchctl unload –w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist\n\nAdd this app to run at startup and it'll solve the error when you open the Citrix Receiver application.\n\nA: I mainly followed the answer from the Citrix Discussion\nmacOS: prevent workspace/receiver from starting at login/boot.\nIn short:\n\n*\n\n*In /Library/LaunchAgents, I changed the name of com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist to com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist_bu just to keep a copy for the future.\n\n\n*I opened com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist and com.citrix.safariadapter.plist and set the value \"RunAtLoad\" to \"false\".\n\nA: Like @cheezsteak mentions, starting and stopping is done through launchctl. The process below allows you to stop autostart at boot. \nFirst, I fetched a list of all \"citrix\" processes that run on startup:\nlaunchctl list | grep citrix\n\nIn order to remove them completely from starting up automatically, I use the following commands:\nlaunchctl remove com.citrix.ServiceRecords\nlaunchctl remove com.citrix.ReceiverHelper\nlaunchctl remove com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac\n\nThe only issue now is that when you open the Citrix Receiver application, you may get something like the following error:\n\nUnable to connect to the citrix AuthManager service\n\nTo fix this, you manually need to start the services again:\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac.plist\n\nUnfortunately, this is a bit of a cumbersome process. Especially to repeat it every now and then. But I've made it simple as an Automator task, which runs the mentioned commands to start the service and immediately after start the Citrix Receiver.\nActually, I have no doubt that it is relatively easy for Citrix to make this configurable as a preference. There is actually a discussion on their forum about this, but it appears dead and without response. For the time being - and as mere principle - I choose the hard way myself.\nFor further reference about launchctl, this AskDifferent answer is quite helpful.\n\nA: The following services are are started at login by launchd \n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist\n\nYou can use launchctl to stop the processes like so\nlaunchctl stop com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac\n\nHowever I am currently unable to prevent launchd from autoloading these services through launchctl.  It is irrelevant because the Citrix Receiver App will not start those services when it starts and will therefore not work if they were stopped or disabled.\nI did notice these services are unneeded if using the the companies web app.  Considering that one can just delete the above .plist files and only use the web app.\n\nA: I removed Citrix from my mac as it was so annoying. I had to run the code above in Terminal in order to kill the live Citrix first. There were still error messages coming up and I found that there were files with citrix in their name in Library/LaunchAgents and Library/LaunchDaemons, I deleted those, Citrix seems gone from my computer.\nFor those who have to live with Citrix, I am suggesting keeping the app but getting rid of those launch files anyway to avoid seeing this come up at startup.\n\nA: This has been annoying me forever as well.  I tried the above steps via Terminal & to delete the Plists for citrix but would not stop auto launching on my MacBook Air.\nThe following Citrix Uninstall worked for me & allowed the Citrix Desktop application to be deleted.\nThe Uninstall seems to do a reasonable cleanup of itself as well.\nhttps://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace-app-for-mac/install-uninstall.html\nFinally!!!!\n", "Q: Can't put my new music I bought on my iTunes My new iTunes music I have bought on my iPad isnt showing up on the iTunes on my computer so I can put it on my iPod help!\n\nA: The most likely problem is that your computer isn't logged in to the same AppleID as the one you purchased the music under. Go to System Preferences→iCloud and check which account you're logged in as. Alternatively, in iTunes look in the Store menu. One of the menu items will be \"View Account (your_account_name_here)\".

The feature is missing. \n1) How can I save a video to my Camera Roll ? \nI want preferably a solution that do not need a computer.\n2) Bonus question : Why has Apple limited this feature to photos ?\n\nA: Apple doesn't have a solution on iOS to accomplish this. I've not found any third party app from the App Store that will read the shared stream videos or receive a paste event (you can copy the video from Photos app on iOS, but pasting it anywhere seems to not work for me on iOS 8.x)\nI use iPhoto on OS X to view the shared video and then import them into my library. From there, I can get the videos onto iOS. Not exactly your preferred solution, but it works well enough for me.\n\nA: Copy the video and paste it in an iMessage to yourself. \n\nA: There are now apps that can download these online videos directly into your camera roll. Most are free for basic functions and the ones that I have used include Video Download.\n\nA: Maybe have your friend email you the video or upload it to  Dropbox or MEGA as private.

Will it damage my phone?\n\nA: You can charge an iPhone with any reputable USB charger, but unless it is designed for Apple will charge very slowly (~100mA the USB default).\nIn some cases (this is based on earlier iPod dock) the device will refuse to charge if it incapable of negotiating a charge rate.\nYou would have more luck plugging into a computer.

I have a blank 8 GB USB Drive.\nI'm trying to set up Boot Camp and install said copy of Windows onto my new Macbook Pro. In order to do so, it seems I need to create a USB installer from an ISO of Windows; it won't allow me to just use the DVD.

I'm thinking of setting up Boot Camp on my early 2011 MBP for gaming purposes because, obviously, VMs just don't cut it when they have to share their hardware with OS X. However, several forums I've read say that a Boot Camp partition could make the computer susceptible to malware that can somehow access the OS X partition. Short of using two separate drives, is there anything I can to totally isolate the partitions from each other, or otherwise keep the OS X partition totally safe?\nSome links about it.\n\nA: If your Mac OS partition is encrypted with FileVault 2, it will be unreadable when you are booted to Windows. At that point, the only thing malware could do to this partition would be to wipe or delete it.\n\nA: The access to the OS X partition on Windows is managed through the HFS+ driver. If you uninstall it from Windows, the OS X partition will become inaccessible from Windows. It does virtually protect you from any kind of attack, unless a malware include itself the drivers (I hardly see that happening) or it simply deletes the whole partition. However, you won't be able to access any file in the OS X partition whilst using Windows if you uninstall the driver. \nUnfortunately there is no other way. As stated in the previous answers, any piece of software running on a hardware has fully access to it, if no virtualisation is assumed. \n\nA: \na Boot Camp partition could make the computer susceptible to malware that can somehow access the OS X partition.\n\nA better way to state this would be:\n\nRunning Windows could make the computer susceptible to malware that can somehow access the OS X partition.\n\nAny booted operating system on any partition has full control of any connected devices. The big advantage of a virtual machine is the rest of the computer does not exist as far as the virtualized part is concerned.\nSo, if you want to boot Windows on your Mac you are for all intents and purposes running a Windows machine with all it's vulnerabilities. But the hardware looks great.\n", "Q: Yosemite - Change default C and fortran compilers I am struggling to build a climate model that depends heavily on C and Fortran compilers installed on the machine.\nI installed XCode and its default compilers, but I had to install more recent versions from MacPorts since I need updated compilers.\nTherefore, I currently have two distinct versions of the compilers installed on my Mac (using here gcc as an example, but it is the same with gfortran):\ngcc, from XCode, installed on /usr/local/bin/gfortran\ngcc-mp-4.9, from MacPorts, installed on /opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.9\nWhat I need to do is to set gcc-mp-4.9 as the default gcc compiler of the system, for any purpose at all. I created an alias on my bash.profile:\nalias gcc='gcc-mp-4.9'\n\nwhich works if I just type gcc on terminal. However, if I type \"which gcc\", the system still detects the old version:\n$ which gcc \n/usr/bin/gcc\n\nwhich causes me some troubles, because most of the libraries I have to build rely on the output of 'which' to determine the compiler to be used.\nWithout removing /usr/bin/gcc or creating symblic links, is there any way to indicate to the system that gcc-mp-4.9 is the default gcc compiler for any occasion?\nThanks in advance,\nThiago.\n\nA: After some deeper research, I came up with the solution.

That's the hard way.\n2) You can also delete your iCloud account if you don't have any purchases of content attached to it. I highly doubt that you don't need the account and that's why I would tell your daughter to go to the iPhone Settings>>iCloud>>Sign Out. She can then sign in with her own iCloud/Apple ID. If she doesn't have one, she can set up a new Apple ID and new iCloud account by following these steps. While at it, she'll make things a lot easier if her icloud account is the same as her apple ID account. Access to all of your content will be much more simple. This is a mistake a lot of people make.

Safari takes about a minute to launch occasionally, as an example.\nGranted, I've got a number of background tasks running (Dropbox, BitTorrent Sync, AirServer), but that's unchanged compared to before upgrading to Yosemite. \nMy main suspect is the very high network usage. The process kernel_task is using a lot of LAN bandwidth, occasionally downloading 60 MB (that's megabytes)/s for a few seconds before going down to zero, for no apparent reason. The total amount of bandwidth used has exceeded 14 terabytes (!) after a couple of weeks of uptime.\nI've got a NAS that I use for sharing files and backups, but since the process using the bandwidth is kernel_task, I don't know what to think.\nUpdate: As a temporary workaround I have setup a script to clear the systemstatsd files mentioned below regularly, but the root cause remains unresolved. \nToday I noticed three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*In three days, total downloaded data amounts to 3,300 GB. \n\n*Currently, approximately every 12 seconds there is a boost in network activity, where something maxes out the Ethernet interface for a couple of seconds. \n\n*Quitting the BitTorrent Sync app made item number 2 go away. \n\n\nMy theory is then: there's some bug in BitTorrent Sync that causes it to go nuts on the network, which in itself uses quite some system resources. This in turn causes systemstatsd to hiccup, which creates the final burden on the system. \n\nA: The culprit was indeed systemstatsd. The way I understand it, that process both produces a number of system stats, dumps them into a file which it later analyzes. For some reason, that file never got reset, resulting in a giant stats file that took serious resources to analyze.\nWhat I did was stop the analysis daemons,\n\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.systemstatsd\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.systemstatsd.analysis\n\nremove the stats dump file (which was about 3 gigs in size at the time)\n\ncd /private/var/db/systemstats/\nsudo rm snapshots.db\n\nrelaunch the daemons\n\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.systemstatsd\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.systemstatsd.analysis\n\nI never figured out why that dump file never got cleared, but suspect it'd something to do with the PRAM, so for good measure I finally reset it by rebooting and pressing CMD, ALT, P, R when the boot chime was heard until it was heard a second time.\nThe end result is a mac that is very much snappier than before. Here's hoping that zapping the PRAM did eliminate the root cause.\nFurther reading: What is the use of snapshot.db?\n\nA: Your systemstats seems to be running out of control, that would explain sluggish operation.\n\nThe systemstats process is used to retrieve information about system\n  statistics and power usage\n\nJust to compare I have systemstatsd at 0% CPU usage on my MBA with Mavericks after 50 hours of CPU time. And for the disk usage is 18 MB (from a Total of 45 GB), so no TB's.\nYou can help it by resetting it.\nCopy paste following in your Terminal that is located in your Utility folder.\nsudo killall systemstats\n\nenter your log in password when asked.\nOr if you do not like using Terminal use the Activity Monitor window:\nSelect the errant systemstats process and choose the (x) button to force quit.\nPS\nYes there are 2 processes, the systemstasts and the systemstatsd.\n*\n\nWhat could be causing it: Generally, there’s nothing to concern\n  yourself with if you see systemstats spike up Activity Monitor or top\n  for a short amount of time, and many standard Mac functions may cause\n  it to temporarily appear. For example, the systemstats process is\n  triggered on the MacBook line by looking at the Energy usage option\n  from the OS X battery menu, and other users may see it briefly when\n  adjusting other Energy settings. The problem arrises when the process\n  is running constantly at very high CPU usage for no apparent reason.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You might want to check your Energy usage, your battery ect.. or do a SMC reset.\n\nA: We have a late 2009 Mac Mini.

To achieve this, I was planning on using the Migration Assistant (MA) tool with a Time Machine (TM) backup stored on a USB drive. However, MA keeps telling me that there is not enough space to complete the migration, even though the TM backup is ~24 GB, and the Mac Mini comes with a 500 GB HD.\nI have checked here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/11412283#24471966\nbut none of the advice given there help me. I have also checked the disk (multiple times) using diskutil. \nDo you guys have any tips on how to resolve this? Are there any other ways in which I could perform the transition?\nThanks a LOT in advance!\nEDIT: I have tried to connect the two machines via FireWire - same issue. In the dialog box where I can select what to migrate, I have tried unselecting user data, applications, etc. What's strange is that MA keeps telling me I have not enough space on the target drive even if I unselect everything except for, say, the settings.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me. I lost a Mac virtual machine, which was not backed up by time machine on the host system, but it WAS backed up by the guest OS X system itself. After creating a new guest OS X system and figuring out that Migration Assistant was the correct method of restoring from a Time Machine backup, I was blocked by the same issue. MA claimed that I needed more space to restore the data from the backup. My target system was a single drive system with 80GB of total space and 60GB free, while the backup was only around 30GB in size. Even when only a small amount of files were selected, MA refused to restore it.\nThe target system had Server.app installed, while the original system backed up did NOT have Server.app installed. So, I simply moved Server.app to the Trash, and tried MA again... this time it worked and had no issues.\n\nA: I have been having this problem when using Migration Assistant to move from a 10.6 install to a 10.11 install, and could get nowhere. \nA reference in this discussion: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7523071?start=0&tstart=0 to Charles Edge's TakeControl of OSX Server book seemed to indicate that it might be a \"Server.app\" issue. For me, the old 10.6 system was not a \"Mac OS X Server\" machine, but the new 10.11 system did have the Server.app software installed and running.\nhttps://www.takecontrolbooks.com/osx-server\nWhen I removed \"Server.app\" from the /Applications folder, and gave my admin credentials, the system informed me that it would turn off all the Server services, but leave the data intact at /Library/Server. Now when I run Migration Assistant.app (after using sudo hdiutil attach /Path/To/Image.dmg to get the sparse disk image with the TimeMachine data to remain mounted after Migration Assistant.app logs me out as mentioned http://www.blueboxmoon.com/wordpress/?p=854 ), I am able to select various items without the claim that there is not enough room.\nI just (2016/08/21) did the migration and it has successfully completed with no errors about being out of space.\n\nA: Have you tried directly connecting the old Mac and the new and using Migration Assistant? Rather than trying to move EVERYTHING (which takes a long time) do it in stages e.g. move user data only.\n\nA: Let's try this to reset TM:\n\n\n*\n\n*In TM Preferences, put the slider to OFF\n\n*Open the backup disk > Backups.backupdb > your Mac’s name > drag  to the Trash the folder “Latest”.\n\n*In /Macintosh HD > Library > Preferences > drag to the Trash the file com.Apple.TimeMachine.plist.\n\n*In the TM Preferences panel click Select Disk, choose the disk again as Backup Disk and everything should be fine.\n\n\n• A new backup will be taken.\n\nA: Use an external disk. Install a base system and migrate to that disk. Boot up from the external disk. Move larger data stores off and out of the disk. Things like the mail folder will be large (/Users/YourName/Library/Mail), the mobile sync folder (/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/Mobile Sync), etc., If you have lots of photos and music, next copy the iTunes folder to the external disk and delete the iTunes folder in /Users/YourName/Music/<iTunes>, follow by copying the iPhotos folder along with the Photos folder located in /Users/YourName/Pictures/<iPhoto Library> and /Users/YourName/Pictures/<Photos Library>\niTunes, iPhoto, and Photos all allow you to hold the option key during launch to select a new library location. This means you can store them on an external disk. You can decide if you want to leave them on the external disk you moved them to or move them back if there's enough space on the new drive. To do that press the option key and click on their respective icons in the dock. Just before the programs launch you will be presented with a screen to choose the location of the library container.\nTypically I find that moving only the music and photos give a huge space savings and that should be enough. If it's not then...\nFind large files by sorting from largest to smallest size. Make notes regarding the path to the files before removing them and saving them on another disk. Do the migration from the external (now trimmed down disk) then move the files you temporarily stored elsewhere into their proper locations.

(If you end up back on the login screen after a flash of the black screen with white lettering, enter your password and it will return to the black screen.)\n\n*Check and repair the drive by typing /sbin/fsck -fy then ↩ enter - as directed by the on-screen text.\n\n*Mount the drive as read-write by typing /sbin/mount -uw / then ↩ enter.\n\n*Remove the Apple Setup Done file by typing \nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone then ↩ enter.\n\n*Reboot by typing reboot then ↩ enter.\n\n*Complete the setup process, creating a new admin account.\nNote that this may result in the new account being logging in automatically when the system is restarted, replacing whatever account may have been set to automatically log in previously. If you need to retain access to the original account without knowing its password, this may mess that up.\n\nA: You can boot your Mac into single user mode by holding Cmd-S key while the system startup\n\n\n*\n\n*mount when read & write mode mount -uw /\n\n*you can create admin group and account by using dscl utility \n\n\nPS: This procedure does require you to type a fair number of commands, you can alternatively use the OS X setup assistant for recreating the admin account. To do so, after booting to Single User mode and setting the file system for write access (see above), then run the following command:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nA: Answer for 2022/Big Sur:\nDoing this in Single User mode may still be possible, but for several reasons I found it way too difficult*.\nI found deleting the .AppleSetupDone file from Recovery to be far easier:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot holding down Cmd-R to enter Recovery\n\n\n*open Terminal from the Utilities menu\n\n\n*Enter the following (assuming your boot disk is called 'Macintosh HD')\nrm /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\n\n\n*restart the computer and create a new admin user via the Setup Assistant\n\n\n*(optionally, if you had on old admin user who got somehow \"de-adminned\", promote that user to an admin and remove the new admin account)\n*\nmounting disks r/w is now four commands in two sections and a bunch of extra info scrolled past while I was doing them, so the instructions scrolled off the top of the screen before I could finish them! And you can't copy/paste. Also dscl failed to do anything, complaining about missing files\n\nA: Boot off the recovery partition, open up terminal, and type\nresetpassword\n\nThat should bring up a dialog that will allow you to change your password and, maybe, set the account to admin. If you cannot set an account to admin, then you will need to reboot into single user mode (hold Cmd-S while starting up your Mac). When you get to the command line (black screen, white text) type:\nmount -uw /\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nThis makes the file system writeable, and then removes the file that tells OS X that you've setup the system. Hit Ctrl-D\" to continue your boot and you should get the \"Welcome to Macintosh\" startup and you will be able to setup a NEW account (make sure it is a new account). This account will be an admin account.\n\nA: There are several ways to regain/recreate administrator privileges on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*The administrator account exists, but the password is forgotten:\n\n\nBoot into Recovery Partition, choose Terminal from the Utilities menu and type following:\nresetpassword\n\nThis will launch the Reset Password app with which you can select an account and set a new password for it, thus enabling login for it.\n\nResetting the password does NOT change the password of the account's keychain file, so accessing data in the keychain still requires the original password.\n\n\n*The administrator account does not exist and/or we want to create a new admin with the Setup Assistant\nThe goal is to remove a flag file /var/db/.AppleSetupDone which tells macOS that the Setup Assistant has already completed. If the file is missing macOS will launch the Setup Assistant which includes the creation of a new account with administrative privileges (same as on first boot of a new Mac). Note that this may result in the new account being logging in automatically when the system is restarted, replacing whatever account may have been set to automatically log in previously. If you need to retain access to the original account without knowing its password, this may mess that up.\nYou can make Setup Assistant run in (at least) three ways:\na) use Terminal in Recovery. First you boot in Recovery Partition (CmdR at boot) and select Disk utility from the Utilities window. Select your system volume (usually named Macintosh HD) and click Mount button on the toolbar. Now the volume is read/write. Close Disk Utility, launch Terminal from the menu and type following command:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nPress Enter, quit Terminal and restart your Mac. When the system boots, Setup Assistant will be shown and you will be prompted to create a new administrative account.\nb) use Single User Mode. First you boot in Single User Mode (CmdS at boot). When the system boots up and prompt #root is displayed type following commands:\n\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nexit\n\nWhen the system boots, Setup Assistant will be shown and you will be prompted to create a new administrative account.\nc) use Target Disk mode with another computer\n\nIf you have another Mac available, you can use Target Disk Mode (T at boot) and connect FireWire, Thunderbolt or USB-C cable between the Macs. On the other Mac you will see a yellow icon representing an external disk (but is actually the internal disk of your Mac in Target Disk Mode) which you can access with full read/write capabilities. Note the yellow volume name (usually Macintosh HD) and type following in Terminal (with appropriate volume name entered):\nrm /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nEject the yellow volume and use power button to shutdown and restart your Mac. When the system boots, Setup Assistant will be shown and you will be prompted to create a new administrative account.\n\n\n*use Single User Mode and use command line tools to directly create a new user and make it a member of administrator group:\n\n\nFirst you boot in Single User Mode (CmdS at boot). When the system boots up and prompt #root is displayed type following commands:\n\n/sbin/mount -uw /\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist\ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin\ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin UserShell /bin/bash\ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin RealName \"Joe Admin\" \ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin UniqueID \"510\"\ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin PrimaryGroupID 20\ndscl . -create /Users/joeadmin NFSHomeDirectory /Users/joeadmin\ndscl . -passwd /Users/joeadmin password \ndscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership joeadmin\ndseditgroup -o edit -a joeadmin -t user admin\nexit\n\nThis will create an account \"joeadmin\", account ID 510, with password \"password\" which will be an administrator.\n", "Q: iCloud is giving me empty PDF files I can't download a PDF from iCloud that someone is sharing with me. \n\n\n*\n\n*I get an email from the person with a link to iCloud.\n\n*The link opens in my browser. It says 'downloading should soon begin', although nothing happens.\n\n*I see in my Downloads folder the file name in question - but they have the format myfile.pdf, myfile (1).pdf, myfile (2).pdf, and myfile.pdf.part.\n\n*I try to open myfile.pdf and an error appears saying \"This file is empty.\"\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I've had this happen to me when the PDF itself was corrupt. Just plain \"weird\" behavior including what you've just described - the download beginning, nothing happening, the actual file eventually showing up and being unopenable.\nSome things to try, in no particular order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the file size - it's possible you really did download a 0 byte PDF. What shows up under Size when you hit Get Info on the downloaded file? If it is 0, try downloading the link from another machine on another network (on your phone or another computer, perhaps). If that doesn't work, the problem is likely on the sender's side.\n\n*If the file is a substantial size (around a meg or more), the problem might be on the sender's end. Something you could try if you suspect the file is getting mangled, is to have whoever created this file compress it in a ZIP/DMG and send you that file. \n\n*Try downloading an alternative PDF reader like the official Adobe Reader and see if that can open it. Perhaps there's something strange about this file that Preview doesn't like.\n\n*Another way to confirm if the file is completely corrupt or not is to open up Terminal, navigate to your download folder (cd ~/Downloads), and then run the file command on one of the downloads. (file myfile.pdf). This checks the bits in the file that tell your computer what it is. If it's a real PDF, you should see something like:\nmyfile.pdf: PDF document, version 1.6\nBut if you see:\nmyfile.pdf: data\nthe file is indeed unreadable. If you see anything else, the output will give you a hint as to what you need to open it.\n", "Q: Is there a Developer and Inspect feature in Mail.app Is there a Developer and Inspect feature in Mail.app?\nWithin Safari.app, I have a developer menu which includes an Inspect item which allows me to investigate issues with HTML in the browser.  \nDoes such a feature exist in the Mail.app?\n\nA: To inspect the underlying code of a message, you can use View > Message > Raw Source.  \n\nA: No, other than the Raw Source.\n", "Q: Playing fullscreen in the same window I have Vlc version 2.1.4 operating on Mac OSx Yosemite.

How do I get the sequencing corrected?\nContext: Macbook Pro, Yosemite 10.10.1.\n\nA: First you have to close all previously opened files (slides) in Preview. \nAnd also close all Preview windows. \nCheck your Preview preferences settings:\n\nNow start with your process and use Sort by \"Name\" in Preview.\nTo do that use Select all (Thumbnails) and right click on one of them, a new pop up will show the sort by.\nIn Preview File-Open, and open the slide you want to add.\n", "Q: Override keyboard shortcut in Safari 6 In Safari 6, the keyboard shortcut ⌘ Command-1 opens the first bookmark on the bookmark bar.

Or will my phone wipe automatically since I selected the \"erase data\" function? I just want to make sure the thief won't be able to access any of the data on that phone.\nI appreciate the help. Thanks!\n\nA: It was really wrong that you have choosen to remove device from account. If you have passcode on it your data is probably safe but since you have removed it from your account it can now be restored as new without any iCloud lock whatsoever.\n\nA: When it reconnects to a network it will go in lost mode and start deleting the files, but if the thief doesn't connect to one then all of your data will still be on the device. You shouldn't have removed it from your iCloud account because now if the person restores the device before connecting it to a network because now the phone can be restored and iCloud lock won't stop it.

For a week or so it was like my box was on steroids, then I saw the beachballs more and more often. Took a backup, formatted my disk and re-installed Yosemite from scratch - no improvement.\nSymptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Last two times I started the box, Safari, which I just ran to save a wallpaper is stuck with a great big spinner. Nothing else can be run and even the top bar was missing. When I turned the computer off and on, I was sent to System utilities which made me suspect a harddisk failure is imminent and perhaps the root problem.\nI have now let the computer sort itself out - when I woke it, all tabs in Chrome were in a state of loading, but immediately got the pages loaded and I have for now as I write this a very responsive system.\n\n*When in Chrome (my default browser, I sometimes get no response, then a beachball, then more often than not an \"Aw Snap\" or Kill page? which make me suspect a network issue (all other devices are happy with my time capsule - iPhone apple TV and iPad - yes I am 100% Apple here) \nI contacted Apple Support with this story as a Yosemite issue and was told to re-install snowleopard which came with the machine. I want to make sure my iMac is borked first since then I will upgrade to a newer iMac instead.\nThe fact that I am now breezing along with no issues and pages loading and switching much faster than under Mountain Lion makes me want to first investigate if there is something you guys can detect based on some test you can suggest.\n\nHardware Overview:\n  Model Name:   iMac\n  Model Identifier: iMac8,1\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core 2 Duo\n  Processor Speed:  2,66 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores:    2\n  L2 Cache: 6 MB\n  Memory:   4 GB\n  Bus Speed:    1,07 GHz\n  Boot ROM Version: IM81.00C1.B00\n  SMC Version (system): 1.29f1\n\nUPDATE If your iMac slows down and hangs like mine, have a look in the console for hardware issues.

Best would be to run 'Onyx' and clear out the Boot Cache.\n\n\nDon't forget that spotlight would be reindexing your machine after an upgrade, so that could be an explanation for the slow performance at first.\n\nA: I tried very many things in a similar situation (beachballs all over the place, system unusable).\nActivity Monitor said system was not being used for anything (95% idle, memory mostly free, no apps hogging anything or \"red\") \nTech tool Pro said no problems. \nDisk Utility found no problems\nPreferenceCleaner found no problems\nForced spotlight to reindex\nRemoved unnecessary preference panes and startup items. \nChecked all USB devices and connections. \nLogged in with different user and same probs. \none of the error messages was \"kernel: CoreStorageGroup::completeIORequest - error 0xe00002ca detected for LVG \"Macintosh HD\" (EE74B25C-0D2C-49B5-BF7D-EFF4D0D4EA18), pv F035EDD4-32D0-4718-B83B-2D61C774E567, near LV byte offset = 320161787904.\nkernel: disk1: I/O error.\"\nThis is what finally fixed it \nSystem Controller Reset: \nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n", "Q: Scale menu bar size I am sure by this time a lot of us are using 2560 or a new 4K displays, which allow to fit a lot of content in. However, the size of the menu bar becomes pretty difficult to read on them so my question is whether I can scale the size of the menu bar to improve readability on high resolution displays?\n\nA: OS X scales the entire display's content for high resolution displays. This means that the menu bar, along with the rest of the content is scaled to be an appropriate size, per an 'indended' resolution selected in System Preferences.\n\nContent such as 4K video which plays within a high-resolution-supporting app will show pixels literally on the display without any scaling. For example, running FCPX will show the player in literal 4K and the rest of the UI scaled.\n", "Q: See what a previously purchased app costs on iOS App Store How can I on the iOS App Store see what an app that I've already bought costs at the moment?\n\nA: You could use an app like AppShopper, which shows the current price of an app as well as past price changes. AppShopper also has a website where you can find the same information, for example for GarageBand: http://appshopper.com/music/garageband (you can change the country/currency at the bottom right of the page, past price changes are shown in the “app activity” box).\n\nA: Browse to the app within the iOS app store. Click the 3 dots [edit: for newer versions of iOS, the Send/Share button (box with uparrow)], and select 'Gift app...\" you will see the current price displayed.\n\nA: The only way to know the price from the Store requires that the specific app is not installed on your device, and not being signed in. Details:\nIf the app you want to know the price about is not installed on your device, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store app. The app opens with featured section highlighted. \n\n*Go to the bottom of the list in that section.\n\n*Tap on your Apple id. \n\n*Tap on sign out. \n\n*Force-close the app (the App Store app) i.e. open the multitask pane and swipe the app out of the screen.\n\n*Open the App Store app again. \n\n*Look for your app and you will see its price. \n\n\nIf the app is installed on the device, you could delete it and follow the above process.\nIf you wouldn't like to uninstall (and possibly install again), then the best option is watching the result from googling itunes appname, where appname is the (approximate) name of the app. \n\nA: As I known, there is no way to see on App Store directly. \nUsually you will get a receipt deleveried via email after buying an App, in which you can see the price at that moment.\n\nA: If you're looking for the current price (which might not be the price you paid), you can Google search for the product and Google will display the App Store price in the results:\n\n", "Q: Does OS X Yosemite support spotlight on network drives?

However, I have created a few folders on the root level of my home folder, and those ARE accessible to this other user. They can open folders, and open some of the documents with ReadOnly access.\nIs anyone else seeing this? Is this a standard configuration, or is my Mac screwed up? This seems like a security hole to allow users to access files of other users on the system.\nI'm running a fairly clean build of Yosemite 10.10.1 - this was installed about a month ago. I restored my old files from a hard drive. They were not restored via Time Machine\n\nA: If you wish new folders at the top level of your home folder to by default be non-readable by anyone but you, add the following two ACLs to your home folder. DO NOT PROPAGATE PERMISSIONS. The first ACL makes all new folders unreadable, unwritable, and unsearchable by everyone. The second ACL makes an exception for you. Be sure to enter them in this order, so the second entry can push itself to the front.\nchown +a \"group:everyone deny list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,directory_inherit,limit_inherit,only_inherit\" ~\nchown +a# 0 \"user:$USER allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,directory_inherit,limit_inherit,only_inherit\" ~\n\nBut truth be told, it's easier to just fix up the permissions on any subfolders you create directly under your home folder. I mean, it's not like you're going to do that often, right?\nAnd besides, who's to say you want these new folders readable only by you? What if you want a folder that is group-readable for some group but not world readable? These inherited ACLs are just going to get in your way then.\nCreating a top-of-home-folder folder should be a rare event. Ad hoc solutions are best for rare events.\n\nA: This is the standard permissions configuration and has been around since the beta days of Mac OS X when Unix underpinnings were established for Apple’s new computer OS.\nThe root of your home folder is global read, but standard macOS folders within such as Desktop and Documents should be global no access. Feel free to set the permissions of other folders which you create in the root of your home folder to match the permissions on the standard folders.\nIf you wish new folders to, by default, be global no access, change the permissions on the root of your home folder, propagate the permissions recursively and set up ACLs to inherit permissions for new folders, however I am unsure as to any effects this may have.\n\nA: Wow I was quite shocked when I realized this. \nAnother solution is to lock the home directory for everyone else:\nchmod 700 ~\n", "Q: Login or unlock screen on a Mac using an NFC tag? Does OSX have support for unlocking the screen (or logging in) using a NFC or RFID tag?\nThe ACS ACR122T USB NFC dongle (a PC/SC device) seems to have working OSX drivers, but no software suite for login is available.  Rumors has it that Dangerous Things are working on that.\nA workaround is to use a RFID/NFC reader that acts as an HID/input device, such as the RfidLoginer.  But that doesn't sound very safe, especially since the linked device only sends the RFID device ID.\n\nA: In earlier versions of OS X (i.e. 10.9 and older) you had the /usr/sbin/pcscd executable, which the driver that comes with your ACR122T dongle can talk to.\nIn the latest OS X (10.10), pcscd has been replaced by something new called com.apple.ctkpcscd, which will be running in a default install of Yosemite.\nThe documentation for this new daemon is available from:\nhttps://smartcardservices.macosforge.org\nHere you can also get the source code, etc.\n", "Q: encoding of filenames in zip archives When I unpack a zip archive (with standard 'archive utility') that was created under windows, cyrillic characters in filenames become some gibberish.\nJust the filenames are the problem, actual contents of files is ok.\nHow to fix this?\n(Yosemite, if that's important. In general, I have a lot of files with cyrillic filenames — and they are displayed just fine (including on flash drives from windows users etc).)\nUpd. Looks like the source of the problem (many modern zip unarchivers assume that filenames are in unicode, but that's not always the case) and a possible workaround (convmv) is described e.g. at http://blogs.gnome.org/happyaron/2010/09/03/workaround-of-file-name-problem-while-unzip-handling-cjk-encodings/\n\nA: I wrote a Qt based utility specifically for handling and fixing double encoded filenames: \nhttps://github.com/dennis97519/EncodingConverter\n\nA: I found this that might help you.\n\nAssuming your decompress tool passes the raw filenames directly to the\n  VFS layer, it's not enough for the filenames to be in UTF-8. They must\n  also be in Normal Form D. Having the filenames in Normal Form C\n  will end up having them mangled in the VFS layer.\n\n\nA: A very simple solution is to use The Unarchiver (free on App Store) which, by default, is configured to automatically detect the filename encoding. If it does not detect the language, you can launch the program and under Preferences select the \"Advanced\" tab and configure the \"Filename encoding\" manually.\n", "Q: Macbook 13 inch - Screen Noise on attached display I have a 13 Inch Macbook (2014) running Yosemite -  the computer has been attached to an external dell monitor via the HDMI port.

How can I do this without having to do a full copy of drive contents every time?  I'm on OS X 10.10.\nThis is simply for periodically backing up the contents of drive A.\n\nA: rsync is certainly one way to go.

(I'm writing a script.)\nHow might one go about doing that?\n\nA: You can't, at least not directly. /usr/bin/open will have told some other app to open the file, and then immediately dissociated itself from the whole affair.\nIf you know which app did the actual open, you might be able to use scripting to tell the app to close it. Something like\n/usr/bin/open SomeFile.pdf\n# time passes\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Preview\" to close document \"SomeFile.pdf\"'\n\nBut that pre-supposes that you know Preview is the app, and that this is the correct syntax for telling it to close a document, and that you've gotten the correct value for the document's name.\nYou can eliminate some of that uncertainty by specifying the app in the open command, and by assuming that the document will still be the front document when your script wants to close it.\n/usr/bin/open -a Preview SomeFile.pdf\n# do some stuff\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Preview\" to close front document'\n\n(It might be more robust to refer to the app by its bundle-id rather than name\n/usr/bin/open -b com.apple.Preview SomeFile.pdf\n# do some stuff\n/user/bin/osascript -e 'tell application id \"com.apple.Preview\" to close front document\n\nbut that's barely more than a matter of style.)\nIn general, /usr/bin/open can open just about anything. It behaves like double-clicking, so it can \"open\" windows (in Finder), applications (as themselves), disk images (by mounting them), network shares (by connecting to them), or even ordinary documents (by launching the app currently selected as the default app for that document type). Each of these flavors of \"open\" has its own flavor of \"close\".\n", "Q: Adobe Flash Player.app file alone, without being embedded into a .dmg package where can I download the Adobe Flash Player.app file NOT as a .dmg Installer package to put into the Applications folder.\nI have done so with other files, but cannot seem to find the executable Flash Player file to put into the Applications folder.\nI just want the .app file.  \n\nA: Adobe provides a standalone Flash Player: Flash Player Projector 16.0.\nAdditional also debugger versions are available as well as older versions. \nOriginally it was meant for Flex and Flash developers. \nExample: Starting a flash game\n\n", "Q: Can I disable the linear image scaling in Safari on a retina display?

I have already upgraded the HDD from 250 GB to 1 TB and the RAM is 8 GB, upgraded from 4 GB. \nI need some advice because, while I know quite a lot about software (I study Computer Science at University), I'm not so good on the hardware side of things. So the questions I need answers for are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be the best SSD to get for my Mac? I have been looking at the Samsung 840 Evo, but I was wondering whether something like the Samsung 850 Evo would be worth buying instead. Would I get the extra speeds it offers, seeming as my MacBook Pro can only support up to 3 GB/s instead of the 6 GB/s of newer models. Also the SATA connectors are only version 2, not 3.\n\n*When upgrading it, where do I put the SSD? Before the Fusion Drive came about, I've read that you should put the SSD in the slot where the HDD is, and put the HDD in the Optical Disk slot, as this will avoid problems with Sleep mode (because the SSD will be the boot volume). Is this still necessary with a Fusion Drive, because the system treats the 2 drives as one Logical Volume anyway?\n\n*Would I need to enable TRIM support with a Fusion Drive? Would the Samsung 840 Evo or anything else like that support all that I need?\n\n\nThanks for any help :)\n\nA: re 1: hard to say - if you can spare the Money you should go for the 850 bc. of a (probably) better Garbage Collection (see #3), else go for the 840.\nre 2: The best tutorial for replacing the optical drive with a harddrive (or SSD) can be found at iFixit.com, f.e. this one. You should search for the Tutorial for your model, the link i posted is probably not for your model.\nre 3: There is a hot discussion going on if Trim should be enabled or not and if that is a bad thing. Fact is, Apple has Trim Support enabled only on its own OEM SSDs and disabled it for third party drive. There are Tools to enable TRIM Support, but it could be a not necessary bc. of a better Garbage Collection within the SSD Firmware (see this article and this Article). For general Infos i recommend this Article from Samsung \nBTW, to create a homemade Fusion Drive you need to use the 'Core Storage Volume' Command. You can look it up with \nman diskutil\n\nlook at the 'coreStorage' section. There are some tutorials for creating a homemade Fusion Drive, but it's a very painful process.\n\nA: I have installed quite a share of SSDs in older Macs to give them second breath so to say and can answer your questions from my perspective.\n\n\n*\n\n*What would be the best SSD to get for my Mac?\nJust buy cheapest big manufacturer brand. I have been installing Intel 320 (40GB), Micron M4(64GB), Kingston V300(60&120GB), Toshiba OEM(Marvel chip I believe, 128GB), Samsung 830, 840 EVO(120GB), SanDisk Ultra(if I recall right, 128GB). They all are about the same, all can support TRIM, all have about fine GC, speed varies a bit but you will never feel the difference. But price can be quite different and so of course warranty term.\nIf talking about Samsung EVO specifically then I would now only install it on Windows machine since their selling point is RAPID mode which is only working in Windows. And weakness is TLC cells used for NAND chips.\nSATA3vsSATA2 is only applies when doing much of linear writing&reading. I say just don't bother about that.\n\n\n*\n\n*When upgrading it, where do I put the SSD?\nIn Optibay. You have equal ports in you Macbook and HDD port has Sudden Motion Sensor and rubbered sockets for HDD — why waste it on SSD?\nDidn't have any problems with sleep in SATA Optibays. I even tried putting SSD into PATA optibays and it was fine too BTW.\n\n\n*\n\n*Would I need to enable TRIM support with a Fusion Drive?\nFrankly I don't know. Well for sure you don't need to. But you can if you want that. You can do it with Chameleon SSD Optimiser for example.\n\nThough there is a caveat in Yosemite. Since enabling TRIM on non-Apple\n  drive will patch AppleAHCIBlockStorage.kext signed by Apple you need\n  to disable kext signing and you might not be able to boot into OS X if\n  signing rule be reapplied (like NVRAM will be cleared or so)\n\nAnd also I never tried to create Fusion drive so I can't comment on that.\n", "Q: How to find empty folders using smart folder I need to find all empty folders using smart folder.\nIs there a way to do so?\n\nA: Just select options in the image below and you will get all empty folders.\n\n", "Q: fish shell suggests commands in tmux I use fish shell, it's has option \"suggests commands\", so it is works like in the next screenshot. \nExamle:\nYou type command git status.

I have used iMac or Mac Pro for my Desktop system for the past 5 years but now consider replacing them with MacBook Pro Retina in desktop environment.

Also, I prefer the amalgamation of keyboard and trackpad as seen in the MacBook line.\nHowever, I wonder there are any disadvantages of using MacBook Pro as desktop. Especially, because I have to open the laptop and run the system for the whole day/week/month, which is the way I have used Mac Pro or iMac, I'm worried how it influences the internal battery.\nIs there any serious risk - e.g. increased chance of breakdown, or explosion or ignition for the worst - of letting MacBook Pro to run the system permanently, keep connecting it always to the AC adapter, and rarely shut down the system? Or does it just lead to the exhaustion of the battery life?\nFor your information I use 13' MacBook Pro Retina in mobile environment.

Or a smaller iMac with integrated Iris Pro and Quad i5? If you are so keen on Keyboard and trackpad being together look at Magic Wand and that trackpad is bigger than in Macbook.\n\nA: Every developer at our company uses a 15\" retina MBP (16GB RAM) as a desktop. They're fantastic, and the battery doesn't suffer noticeably. Several of us run two external monitors as well. \nAt night we close the lids and put them in a secure room. \nThe only drawback is network share drives, which seem to need reconnecting each morning, which is a pain if you were working on a file from the network share, but that may well be a network problem at our end. \n", "Q: Play music on iPhone via a mixer with wireless connection I want to play musi from my iPhone on a sound system but connected to the mixer wirelessly.\nWhat interface an I get to plug into the mixer that would receive the music output.

If that is the case, why wouldn't this be the default behaviour when I \"save a password\" on my Mac? \nThanks\n\nA: Within Keychain Access the 'login' keychain is the user names and passwords that you have stored for the current logged in user. The iCloud keychain is as the title states stored in the cloud available to be accessed on any devices under the same Apple ID.\nThe main risk with storing anything within a cloud service is the risk of these online services being hacked. OS/X devices are multi user environments, and under these setups often share an iCloud account, or are using iCloud Family Sharing feature. These features could lead to passwords being available to users/family that you would not want to have access to.\nAs for copying the items over, as far as I am aware there is no way of doing this, looking within Keychain Access application there is no option for this. Also within preferences there is no option to set the default location, any new passwords will be stored within the 'login' keychain.\nHopefully this has cleared things up for you.\n\nA: Copying or moving items is trivial. Either copy them (e.g. edit menu) or drag them. You will need to confirm the action for each item with your password.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt display - Why do programs always start on the laptop screen? I have an MBP Retina with a Thunderbolt display. I have them arranged non-mirrored with the thunderbolt display in front of me (bluetooth keyboard) and the laptop to the right.\nI'm using the TB display for most things and the laptop for 'overflow' when needed.\nThe problem is that whenever I start a new program it appears first on the laptop screen and I have to drag it onto the Thunderbolt display.\nWhy is it doing this, and how can I have it start programs on the thunderbolt display?\n\nA: there are 2 ways to help you solve you issue\n\n\n*\n\n*set the TB display as the \"main\" display. You can drag the \"Menu bar\" to the TB display in \"System preferences\"->Display setting, please refer the screen shot below. As you said the external TB display is most thing, so I suggest you this way.\n \n\n*You can setup App launch in individual desktop or display.

I've a Macbook Pro Retina 15\" Late 2013. My MagSafe 2 connector (T connector) gets really hot when charging.\nIs it normal ??\n\nA: Yes. In my case, my new MacBook Pro Retina 13\" MagSafe connector gets insanely hot but once the charge level reaches above 50% or so, it starts to cool down and then stays lukewarm. \nThe best solution is to not let the Mac's battery discharge too much. It also doesn't make much of a difference to the heat level if your Mac is on or sleeping as the heat level in both cases are similarly high.\n\nA: It can normally become warm, especially if you are using a lot of processor power and have the computer plugged into the magsafe 2 power supply. In my case, a malfunction of either the battery  (on a late-2012 MacBook Pro 15 in. with Retina) or the Magsafe module in the computer was at fault. I replaced both eventually and went through two 85W OEM chargers. I was getting what must have been micro arcing at one of the hot leads in the magsafe plug gap that left one part of the contacts sooted and pitted away--like an EDM wire. Fortunately parts replacement, new battery and new magsafe module (and a new magsafe 2 power supply) has appeared to correct the problem.\nI unplug the power supply if I think it is heating up, although it has not heated anywhere near as much as it did before the parts replacement.\n", "Q: Mac is slower and has strange nuances in operation after liquid contact I need some advice with my MBP late 2011 model (13″ Intel i5, 2.4 GHz, 500 GB HDD, 4 GB RAM).\nIt all started one day when was a heavy rain which went through my windows. I had my Mac on my bed and my bed was completely soaked.\nI wiped off the rain water on my Mac and when I powered it on it didn't turn on. I had to press and hold the power button until it came back to life.\nObservations afterwards\n\n\n*\n\n*Each time I have to turn on my mac, I have to press and hold the power button until the sleep light indicator starts blinking then I release it before it turns on.\n\n*I performed resetting the SMC and it didn't work: http://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295 \n\n*I also realized that the mac is considerably slower after the rain incident so I upgraded to an 8 GB RAM. However even after the upgrade it's still slow. Much slower\nthan my Windows 7 8 GB RAM i5 Acer laptop. I had to download novabench to benchmark their performances for comparison.\n\n*I also formatted my 500 GB hard drive and perform a clean install of OS X Mavericks since that was what I performed the benchmarks on. The newly installed\nOS together with the 8 GB RAM is still really slow (you can tell from using it and also as indicated by the benchmark result)\n\n*I have replaced my 500 GB with an old 256 GB running Mavericks and the performance is still poor.\nMy question is what could possibly be wrong with my mac and how can I get its performace as it was before the rain incident. The 8 GB RAM isn't improving the performance. I am thinking of getting a SSD hoping it will improve the performance but I highly doubt that.\n\nA: I really think your best option is to take it into an Apple-licensed fix-it person and have them open it up. I expect they'll find some kind of damage on the motherboard (probably up and around the underside & top). Water does some gnarly things to electronics, so just because it's still turning on and 'working' doesn't mean there isn't something damaged on the mobo. \n", "Q: Export versions of a document (/.DocumentRevisions-V100) I'm trying to automate the following process:\n\n\n*\n\n*get all versions of a document,\n\n*check in each version to a repository (Subversion, in my case)\n\n\nAs a half-solution, I'd already be happy with:\n\n\n*\n\n*get all versions of a document,\n\n*name them to include a version info (an incrementing revision number, a timestamp, whatever),\n\n*place them in a common directory.\n\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any tool, command-line or otherwise, to help with this. Nor does there appear to be Automator or AppleScript support for managing versions, or, some other means of browsing the /.DocumentRevisions-V100 database for a particular document.\nI only seem to be able to browse to a particular version, mark it as current, save a copy, then repeat. Is this correct? Has anyone attempted to at least speed this up with UI scripting?\n\nA: This is not an answer, but it is too much for a comment. Might be somebody can add information here.\nYou might think the different versions are stored within the file itself. This is not true. The different versions are stored in the following directory\n/.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nYou need admin rights to browse around in that folder, so changing its rights using the following command makes it possible to see its contents without admin rights.\nsudo chmod -R 115 /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nNow you can use Finder to look around in your versions.\nopen /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nYou will notice that the directory structure is a bit un-human, and it looks a bit like the iPod structure if you ask me. The different versions of all your files are stored within this folders. Probably, the /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1/db.sqlite-wal file contains the most important information. But unfortunately I can only guess how these versions are stored.\nIt might be possible to create a smart folder that handles the contents of /.DocumentRevisions-V100 to fetch the versions you want.\n(Most of this info is from: http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/everything_you_need_know_about_versions)\nNew:\nThe /.DocumentRevisions-V100/PerUID/[0-9] directory contains the files per user ID (run the id command in the Terminal to know your user ID). This is were the different versions of all your docs are stored. When I copied this Directory to my desktop and changed permissions, I was able to do spotlight searches on them and find all versions from 1 certain file.\n\nA: the 'NSFileVersion' API can do what you want but it requires programming experience\n", "Q: iPhone 4S shutting down 20-30 % - battery already replaced I've had my iPhone 4S for 3 years and it now runs iOS 7.1\nBattery was performing badly so I decided to replace it.\n\n\n*\n\n*I bought a spare battery online by duracell direct (average quality good!)\n\n*Replaced battery by myself (easy!)\n\n*First 2 running cycles are OK\n\n\nNow, the iPhone shuts off at 30 % (sometimes at 20%). I can even reboot it and use sometines below 10 %, but experience is awful. Tried to do 2-3 calibrations but no luck.\nI checked real battery status with iBackupbot, seems ok.\nHere follows a log frm iBackupBot:\nInfo da iBackupBot il 30/12/2014\nBattery\n\n CycleCount: 5\n DesignCapacity: 1430\n FullChargeCapacity: 1393\n Status: Success\n BatteryCurrentCapacity: 67\n BatteryIsCharging: true\n ExternalChargeCapable: true\n ExternalConnected: true\n FullyCharged: false\n GasGaugeCapability: true\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Few ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried a full blown factory restore? \n\n*Are you SURE everything internally on your phone is secured and exactly as it was when you first opened it? Might be worth it to open it up again and double check.\n\n*Have you contacted the battery seller? I've personally never heard of 'em, but then again I've never been in the market for a new iPhone battery. I would contact them and let them know about the issue. It very well could be that you were sent a dud. \n\n*Last resort: Get it replaced. Not sure what would've gone wrong with the battery replacement, but there ya go. Contact your cell phone service provider or an Apple Store and see if you can either get it fixed by them or get a replacement. \n\nA: You are either shorted something while replacing the battery or battery is a dud. That happens sometime. And since Duracell direct has nothing to do with Duracell brand of batteries it probably a dud.\nSince it is not possible to get original one except from Apple service buy either few of cheapest or one of brand name compatible batteries that don't pose itself like genuine but usually have better quality then knockoffs.\n\nA: When a phone shuts down at voltage levels that show 30 to 80% charge, it's almost always a faulty portion of the battery that causes the voltage to drop precipitously. The other reason would be a loose connection, so if you want to re-check your work, that would be good to focus on. I would expect the device to be much more flakey or you can rule out a bad connection by testing the device with it clamped to a workbench.\nThe charge remaining calculations assume the voltage decay is smooth since that's how Apple's batteries are designed.\nThis chart shows the charge stage and if your phone operated with a constant current drain, it would mirror this in reverse. Your device shutting off means that there is a chemical problem with the battery.\n\nI would seek warranty replacement of the battery or buy another - perhaps with a better return policy if the one you bought has no warranty and/or no return policy.\n\nA: It could be the phone hardware is not recognizing the battery capacity correctly.\nBack up your phone to a computer. Do not only a factory reset but after that plug your phone back in to iTunes and act like you're going to reboot your phone while hooked up to iTunes. Once you see the Apple appear let go of the lock button but continue to hold the home button. This puts the phone in a \"factory settings\" mode.\nIt resets your hardware which a part of that recognizes battery capacity. It worked for me. Swapping those integrated battery throws off those apples.\n", "Q: SSD In iMac G4 not recognized I recently bought an SSD and an IDE to SATA adapter. I've installed these into my iMac G4 (it's the 20\" 1.25GHz model) neither the Leopard installer or Disk Utility will recognize it. \nThe SSD is \nhttp://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX49961\nAnd the adapter is http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX30129\nI've heard that some iMacs will only work with SATA II, but I've also heard that this doesn't matter if using an adapter.\nJust wondering where I should start troubleshooting. Is there anything obvious wrong with these two pieces of hardware?\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure your SSD is working by connecting it to different computer through SATA or SATA to USB adapter.\n\n*Make sure your PATA adapter is working by connecting it to different computer. Also try different drive with it.\n\n*Try to buy another adapter with another chip, prefer unidirectional one.\n\n\nThere a whole lot of incompatibilities with them\nThis one for example is working fine in my FW IDE enclosure with TI chip and not in the FW enclosure with some different chip. Go figure!\n\nA: *\n\n*Is everything plugged in securely? Double/triple check it.\n\n*Does the drive + adapter work in another computer? I'd recommend troubleshooting with another Mac AND a Windows machine if you can. If the drive shows up in Windows but not your Mac, then I'd expect it's a formatting issue.\n\n\nI don't know of any limitation that would suggest that the parts are incompatible, so I expect that you'll find your answer while trying suggestion #2. If it doesn't work in any other computer, you probably have a bad adapter or SSD. If it works in Windows and not Mac, probably a formatting issue. If it works in another Mac, try reformatting/repartitioning it on that and try again on your G4. \nIf that still fails, then I can only assume there's some hardware limitation of your G4 that won't recognize the SSD through the adapter. I don't think that'd be it, though...\n", "Q: How can I connect multiple wireless headphones to the same iPhone at the same time? I like to listen to audio files on my iPhone 6 while jogging outdoors.\nMy girlfriend wants to join me (jog with me and have her own headphones listening to the same audio).\nHow can we both pair our wireless headphones to my iPhone simultaneously so that we're listening to exactly the same thing?\n(And these audio files are not available in some shared location like Spotify.)\n(Also, we own a headphone splitter, but using wired headphones is inconvenient since cords make running difficult.)\n\nA: That would be difficult for the conditions described.\nLooking for most portable solution,I think this BT splitter might do the job.\nhttp://www.solveyourtech.com/can-two-bluetooth-devices-connected-iphone/\n\nA: While it is true that there is no built-in supported method for an iPhone to connect to multiple sets of bluetooth speakers, it is possible to do so.\nYou would need to get an additional device, a Bluetooth splitter. They generally plug in to the headphone jack, and will connect to at least 2 devices. Likely more finicky than using just an iPhone, but possible. Here is one example.\n\nA: As I understand it, iOS 13 will now have this capability:\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2019/05/26/report-iphone-11-could-let-users-send-music-to-two-bluetooth-devices-at-the-same-time/\n\nA: I just stumbled across this after looking at the JBL Synchros E40BT over the ear headphones sold at Crutchfield.\nIt looks like you are basically just pairing one set to the iPhone/ipod etc.  But, the headphones allow you to pair a \"secondary\" set to the first.  The primary set controls the music but the second pair hears exactly what the first is hearing.\n\nA: There is another \"workaround\" that DOESN'T involve Bluetooth. I often train multiple students students for 5K's, 10K's, etc. Since I train multiple students at a time and often use 1-hr long DJ mixes to set paces for everyone, I connect my iPhone to an FM broadcast device (usually limited from a 30-100 feet range). I additionally, I encourage trainees to use wireless devices such as nano shuffles, etc. that can pick up radio FM frequencies. There's no pesky Bluetooth \"pairing\" compatibility issues and anybody can join in by simply tuning in to my FM frequency; even those with nothing more than a simple portable radio/MP3 player. Although these devices were originally intended for tuning into your car radio, I've found they work just as well as for other mobile devices that can receive radio FM frequencies. They're not that expensive, either.\nLink\n\nA: I just bought two SkyGenius over ear headphones on amazon, you can connect two SkyGenius headphones to one iPhone without any splitter, they name this function ‘ShareMe’, you can make the two headphones pairing first, and then pair one of them to your iPhone, then the two headphones can listen simultaneously.\n\nA: Apple is rolling this capability out.  The feature is called Airplay, and both the iPhone or whatever broadcasting device and the headphones must support the standard for this to work.\n\nA: MyStream is an app that lets you share that music wirelessly to your friend's iDevice so you can both listen to the same music at the same time.\n", "Q: How do you remove fonts from the Favorite collection in the Fonts dialog?

I can't find anything in the online documentation about it.\nI think it has something to do with remote/subscribed calendars, but what, exactly?\n\nA: This is the Notifications button.\n\nThe Notifications button shows how many invitations you have. If you don’t have any invitations, it isn’t available.\n\nSource: Calendar: Reply to an event or calendar invitation\nThe notification button also shows when changes are made to a subscribed calendar. In this case, the standard Accept/Decline/Maybe buttons are replaced by a single OK option to dismiss.\n", "Q: How to keep an SSD in shape on Yosemite? As of OS X 10.10, Apple uses kext signing. Ever since it has become difficult and dangerous to manually activate TRIM for third-party SSDs on OS X. That means users with non-Apple SSDs will sooner or later see degrading write speeds. \nSo I am wondering what are my options to avoid this situation. Some approaches I could think of imply additional problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you aware of any alternative approach, that does not require disabling kext signing? \n\n*Are there tools or tricks to manually clean up a SSD (i.e. issue a TRIM command)?\n\n*If I decided to temporarily use a tool like TRIM Enabler how long would it need to be activated, in order to clean the disk?\n\n\nTo summarize: No TRIM on Yosemite. What can I do?\n\nA: EDIT 3:\nYes! Since the release of 10.10.4, Apple now provides a new tool called trimforce, allowing users to activate TRIM also on unsupported disks. So now the ultimate and final answer is: \nsudo trimforce enable\n\n/EDIT 3\nEDIT 1: \nFinally I found a way! Apparently there is a neat trick hidden in the fsck tool as this answer says.\nSo in the future I will boot into Single User Mode (press ⌘+S at boot screen) from time to time and issue the command fsck -fy. It will check the disk and finish with the message Trimming unused blocks.\n/EDIT 1\nEDIT 2:\nSo there is a new tool called Disk Sensei that specializes on exactly that problem. It has a manual TRIM command and helps you turning Yosemite's kext signing on and off.\n/EDIT 2:\nFurthermore, I read about DiskFresh which would somewhat accomplish what I was originally asking for. This Windows (Bootcamp partition required) tool will rewrite all data of partitions or an entire disk. This approach seems a little less painful than wiping my SSD and restoring it from a backup. However, it also comes with the downside of doing an additional write cycle.\n\nA: Alternative approach would be to leave as much space on SSD free as possible for GC to work well.\nI did this i.e. enabled TRIM on clients computer just when Yosemite was released and I didn't fully understand consequences of it. Now I only hope she will install update with new AppleAHCIBlockStorage before she will try cmd+optn+p+r for some reason.\nNow I wouldn't do it on anything except your computer that you can deal with being down for some time if you clear NVRAM. You had to have another Mac or boot media/install media around and printout of sudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1 though.\n\nA: Depending on the SSD manufacturer, I've read that restarting your machine and holding down the option key, which will bring you to the start-up disk chooser and then letting it sit in that state for a few hours without choosing a boot disk will allow garbage collection to commence, I believe I read that on the MacObserver's MacGeekGab or maybe it was the podcast, not sure. Have you heard this to be true? @PascalCouq\n\nA: You might want to try the software \"disktester.\" It has a recondition function that apparently works with SSDs. I haven't yet tried it myself, but it looks pretty legit. \n\nA: I recommend enabling trim and doing firmware updates! :)\n\n", "Q: Run MacBook Pro with lid closed Is there a simple setting to allow a MacBook to continue running with the lid shut?

Typically, I play vids in full screen on my second display connected to my MacBook. When I am not connected to the external display and I play a vid, VLC seems to want to still play in this dual display mode.

Once that's done, do a soft reset on your phone by holding down the power and home buttons until the apple logo appears.\n\n\nNow, see if you can connect to the original or new networks. Do they work at all? If you try to browse to a page in Safari, what do you get?\n\n\n*\n\n*Anyone else with the same problem? If the local wifi is borked, other people are probably having issues too. Ask around! This will be helpful for the next step:\n\n*It's possible that the appearance of the second network is purely coincidental and something is wrong with the RV park's router. Ask the management if everything is okay on their internet - maybe all they need is to power cycle their router and everything will be fine again.\n\n*If that didn't work, the next thing is to determine if the new network is at all related to the old one and how. You're living in an RV park, so I'd have a talk with the management to ask if they recognize the name of either network, specifically the new one. If they do, and they're running it, it's possible that the original network was some kind of \"staff only\" thing and you should be using the other one anyways.\nMany things are possible here, so definitely ask first :)\nNow onto the less likely interference problem\nIf it's an interference issue (this is more obvious if the signal is weak.. while using your phone, you may see it drop the wifi connection and then reconnect often), you may be able to convince the management to put the network onto a different channel. There are 3 \"main\" wi-fi channels: 1, 6, and 11. These are the only 3 channels that don't overlap onto their neighbors. It looks something like this:\n\nIn my experience, most cheap routers start on channel 6, with the result that 6 is often overcrowded. If you can get their wireless moved onto 1 or 11, you may have more luck.\nI must emphasize again that it's more likely that the management has done something or that something is not quite right with their router. You said that the wifi was \"working fine\" before, where if the signal was marginal enough for this new network to be causing problems, you probably would have been having dropoffs the whole time.\nMore drastic measures\nIf that didn't work, if nobody else is having problems, if the management insists that the first network should be usable, then we've isolated the problem to your phone. Next thing to try there is doing a full restore. You'll have to reinstall all of your apps, so this isn't a step to take lightly - but if you wish to try it, follow the steps here on Apple's knowledge base\nIf that doesn't work, it's time to make an appointment at the local genius bar.\nGood luck, and let us know how it works!\n", "Q: Apple Pages: Make a cell span two columns I have a table.

I am an admin that wants to access other users' files. How to do this via the Terminal? \n\nA: As stated by patrix: the personal files of other user's on the same machine are generally stored in the /Users/<username> folder for each user. The permissions on these folders are usually set such that they are private to the individual who owns the files.\nThis means you need to use sudo to elevate your own access levels in order to see their files. If you are truly an admin, using sudo is something that's ok, but do so with caution. If you are not an admin then you shouldn't have the proper sudo privileges to do any of this and your repeated attempts to use sudo are logged in the system access log.\nTo simply list files in another user's home directory (let's call them bob) you do:\nsudo ls ~bob\n\nThe ~ prefix is POSIX shorthand for \"home directory of...\". To browse freely, you can become that user with sudo like so:\nsudo su - bob\n\nThis makes you bob, logged in as bob and in bob's home directory. You can now move around, cat files, open files, etc. as bob.\n\nA: The home folders of all users are stored in /Users. Assuming you have the technical and legal rights to access files of other users, you can do this by changing into their home folder (cd /Users/joe or cd ~joe) and accessing the files there.\n", "Q: How should I start a new iTerm terminal with shortcut?

Let's say I have a particular folder, that has never changed, in the first backup, eg my MP3 music collection from 2009. (I know my important files should be saved elsewhere, but it's just an example).\nIn one scenario, I deleted the folder, and in another, the folder is still in my home folder.\nI dont understand what this means: The oldest backup are deleted when your disk becomes full.\nDoes it means that when there is not any space left on the drive, Time Machine will start deleting my music ? \nObviously if there is no more space left and Time Machine wants to backup new files, it has to delete something. But what exactly does it delete ?\n\nA: Roughly speaking, Time Machine deletes files in the same order you do. (The roughly speaking part has to do with it deleting hourly backups even when there are older daily backups, and daily even when there are older weekly backups.)\nFor example, suppose you create a file in January and delete it in July, and TM is backing up all this time. TM will first see and back up the file in January. From then until you delete the file in July, every time TM does a backup it notices that you have the file but it's already backed up, so it doesn't copy it again. It does, however, put it into every single one of those snapshots. How it does that without copying the file again is fascinating but not important here. The point is, the file is in every one of those snapshots, and won't be deleted until all of them are. Unless you're micro-managine TM, that won't happen until the disk is so full that TM has had to delete everything thru July.\nAnother way to say it: Even though it copied the file only once, it saw it many times, and won't delete it as long as it remembers any of those sightings.\nMore precise rules:\nTime Machine does not backup any file it has never seen. (Duh!) If you create a file and immediately delete it, before TM takes its next snapshot, it doesn't get backed up. This can be summarized as If you don't keep it, neither does TM.\nTime Machine defines an hourly backup as any snapshot that is not the first snapshot of its day. It deletes it when it is 24 hours old, or when you've used \"Backup now\" to force 24 newer hourly backups after it. If you create a file, keep it around until TM takes at least one snapshot (let's call it an hour) but delete it later that same day (or at least before the first snapshot of the following day), TM will keep it for 24 hours. This can be summarized as If you keep it for an hour, TM keeps it for 24 hours.\nTime Machine defines a daily backup as the first snapshot of a day that is not also the first day of the week. TM will keep it for a month. This can be summarized as If you keep it for a day, TM keeps it for a month.\nTime Machine defines a weekly backup as the first snapshot of the week. Rather than get into a religious war about when a week begins, TM defers the decision of whether a snapshot is a daily or a weekly backup until the snapshot is at least a month old. Until then, it doesn't matter, because it'll keep it either way. When a snapshot becomes more than a month old, if there is another snapshot less than 7 days prior, then the newer one is a daily backup, and gets deleted. Otherwise it's a weekly backup and gets retained. This can be summarized as If you keep it for a week, TM keeps it until the disk is full.\nBy the above rules, your initial backup is therefore on the first day of its week, no matter what day that is. Successive \"weeks\" will be at least 7 days long, and may be longer if you don't let TM make regular backups.\nTM is in effect watching what you do with the file to see how aggressively it should preserve it. The longer you keep it before deleting it, the longer TM keeps it before deleting it. Your actions give TM guidance how to put your files into one of four classes: files you deleted before TM saw them, files you deleted before the next day's first snapshot, files you deleted before the next week's first snapshot, and files you kept across a weekend. These groups have successively longer retention periods, matching the fact that they contain files you kept for successively longer times before deleting them.\nIn each group, TM backs up the files in the same order you created them, and deletes them in the same order you deleted them.\nTM never deletes your only snapshot. If it has deleted all but one snapshot to make room, and still does not have enough, it will abort the backup. It's better to have an old backup than none at all. This can be summarized as If you never delete it, neither will TM.\n\nA: Time Machine will always keep a backup of the current state of the contents of the source volume. When the backup drive becomes full, it will start removing the oldest backup states to make room. If the contents of a folder have not changed, it will retain all the contents. If the contents of the folder changed over time, it will remove the oldest content state. So in your example, if you had deleted some MP3's from that folder after the first Time Machine backup and Time Machine had to delete a backup to make room for a current backup, you would no longer be able to recover those deleted files.\n", "Q: Why does Google Chrome launch multiple instances of Google Chrome Helper?

The reviewer in 9to5mac from the link you posted states that the HDMI input ports will only do 4k at 30hz, so the only solution (as he also states) is to purchase a miniDisplayPort to DisplayPort 1.2 adapter or cable. I went for the cable and am currently awaiting its delivery.\nI played with SwitchResX lots. Several threads on the internets suggest overriding the EDID in an attempt to fix the Television=yes in System Report problem, using Picture in Picture mode and running the display off of two cables. Neither of which is very satisfying to me, as its either a) PIP is not for every day use or b) requires plugging two cables, making it further more difficult to mount my machine on a desk and take it off.\nThe DisplayPort cable will hopefully do the trick when it arrives. Meanwhile, I noticed there is some kind of firmware update on the product page of the monitor. It requires a Windows machine, so I have not yet tried it. I can't find a way to see the current firmware version in the display menu either, but Samsung state that its a \"compatibility improvement update\" or some such. There is no changelog as to what changed since the previous version, or any explanation as to how that potential update might occur. To my knowledge, HDMI 1.4 supports Ethernet and maybe thats how the update takes place. If you have a Windows machine around, give it a try and report back please.\nP.S.

I'm upgrading a 2010 Macbook with an Intel 730 SSD.  Since Trim Enabler is still available but more risk, I'm trying to get by with just Disk Utility.\nMy question was prompted by this hint which seems to imply that \"Disk Repair\" will perform a one-time TRIM.  Using either a reminder or an automated script, I could run Repair Disk once a week or once a month to get the benefits of TRIM.\nThere is a similar question at Creative solutions to work around kext signing issue in Yosemite? that does not answer my question.  \n\nA: Did you notice that the interesting bits in the discussion seem to point to Disk Repair having performed a TRIM because Trim Enabler was installed?\nUser jimsander says:\n\nMy guess is it's a result of the 3rd party TRIM enabler - just did Disk Utility --> Repair on my machine (MacBook 2008 w/ Lion + Crucial SSD) and it didn't say it did a TRIM.\n\nIt would not make much sense if Disk Repair made a TRIM happen without Trim Enabler, because what is lacking by default for non-Apple SSDs (and that Trim Enabler provides) is driver support for TRIM. Disk Repair accesses the hardrives through the same driver that the filesystem implementation uses in normal operation, so it won't do the one-time TRIM without the same driver support that would allow the filesystem implementation to trim immediately.\n", "Q: Re-download purchased film on iPad without iTunes I'm having real difficulty finding an answer to this problem and since the device is out of warranty, Apple want to charge £25 for me to even report the problem.\nWe have ONE film that we've purchased on the iPad mini but it was accidentally deleted. Everyone tells me I can simply download it from the store again for free, however the \"cloud\" icon is greyed-out. We decided to bite-the-bullet and buy it again, but that won't work either, it says we already own it.\nI've been told that I need to fix this by connecting to a PC, but this iPad has always been stand-alone and I don't have iTunes (or anything else) loaded on a PC.\n\nA: I've got to the bottom of this now and there is the potential that some of the information may be useful to others so thought I'd submit the entire thing as an answer.\nThe reason why the \"cloud\" icon is greyed-out (and the root of the entire problem) is that the movie in question is No Longer Available from iTunes. I find this bizarre in itself, the movie is 800Mb but for some reason they need to remove that from their servers to save space...?!? \nWhen the movie was first deleted and we tried to re-download it, it definitely still showed as being available in the store. I guess the metadata was still there but the movie itself was deleted.\nThis movie cost £10 around a year ago, you can buy it on DVD for less then £5. The lesson here is to have your OWN backups of material from iTunes because they take no responsibility for allowing you to re-download it later. I thought we OWNED this movie and Apple would guarantee our ability to download it onto any device at any time, but apparently I misunderstood that I was paying more money for a product substantially inferior to a DVD.\nI found this out by phoning Applecare using the number from Jules' link below.\nWhen going through the \"Select an option\" stuff, if I selected \"iPad\", they still wanted £25 to talk to me. By selecting \"iTunes\", I spoke to them for free. I spoke to a very knowledgeable person who was able to explain the problem and offer - if not a solution, then, at least, a form of compensation.\nThe offered me 2 movie-rentals by way of compensation, pretty useless for us but better than having nothing for our lost £10.\n\nA: When you can not download the movie, there are two things i would do\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of itunes & appstore from the settings app. For help see this link\n\n*preform a hard reset\n", "Q: Minimise full screen Steam games in OS X Yosemite Previously, in OS X Mavericks it worked to minimise games, or navigate through open apps with cmd+tab even if the game was opened in full screen but now you can't do that anymore.

Recently I purchased an HDMI to VGA adapter that actually converts the digital signal to an analog VGA signal to connect a computer to an external monitor. It works perfectly with a Windows PC that I tested, but with my MacBook Pro Retina (early 2013 model), no display is detected. I've tried SMC and PRAM resets, several restarts, and hot plugging both ends of the converter, to no avail. \nI read an answer on \"graphics limitations\" of the Mac but am still wondering how that may be the issue, considering that this is has both passive and integrated graphics, rated better than the PC I tested. I would suspect that it is probably a hardware detail that I don't understand here, but I have been having issues with other display cables (HDMI to HDMI) recently, too. I have noticed specific log messages that appear whenever I attempt to connect the two, which I will add in an update.\nIt is worth noting that I am regrettably on the Yosemite public beta (10.10.2) and I am checking to see if this is the issue with a Time Machine restore in a bit.\nUpdate: Restored back to Mavericks and the issue persisted.

Standard msata didn't fit, and from a few consumer reviews of other enclosures and adpaters, it seems to be uncertain if one exists. Its a \"mini PCI-e\" interface, but its been hard finding an enclosure using that term that doesn't end up being an msata one. The SSD installed has 28 pins (12+16). I've seen some mini PCI-e to usb adapters, but they are from sketchy sites with no product reviews.

I don't have Mavericks in my recent purchases in the App Store because my Mac shipped with it. Recovery mode just installs Yosemite. Does anyone have a link to where I can download the OS X Mavericks installer?\n\nA: In order to reset your Mac to your shipped OS you just need to boot it from Recovery Mode, but install from the Internet. It's probably installing Yosemite because you might be restoring from a backup or your possibly doing a Recovery from the drive (which in this case would be the current OS recovery: i.e., Yosemite)\nHere is the difference between the two:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use the Recovery System stored on your startup drive to reinstall OS X, it installs the most recent version of OS X previously installed on this computer.\n\n*If you use Internet Recovery to reinstall OS X, it installs the version of OS X that originally came with your computer. After installation is finished, use the Mac App Store to install related updates or later versions of OS X that you have previously purchased.\n\n\nSee the how-to-guide and additional information reguarding Recovery HERE\nNOTE it states in the docs that it automatically detects when the Recovery System on the startup drive isn't available, however you can manually elect this in the Recovery menu\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the organizer for Family Sharing?

I'm confused about how to set it up with regards to using my Apple ID, or creating a separate AppleID for her.  I've read some things about Family Sharing, but it doesn't seem to address what I want to do. \nWhat I'd really like is for her to be able to download anything she likes from iTunes or the App Store as long as it's free without any need for me to authorize the download.  However, for anything that is not free, I want to be the one who authorizes this with some kind of approval/password.  \nCan anyone please tell me if this type of setup is possible and how to do it?\n\nA: What I would do is create an Apple ID for her without a credit card, along with creating an Apple ID for yourself (hooked to a credit card).\nWithout a credit card, the only way to purchase something would be for her to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a gift card (you still couldn't control that spending)\n\n*If she wants to buy something, she needs to come to you directly.

I've plugged in my Seiki 39\" 4K TV (SE39UY04), but when the \"Best for display\" option is chosen, it outputs 1080p, rather than 2160p.  If I choose \"Scaled\" for the resolution, the only options are 1080p, 1080i, 900p, and 720p.\nHow can I force the Mac mini to output at 2160p?  Or is Apple's marketing wrong and I bought a machine that doesn't actually support 4K over HDMI?\nEdit:  Apparently, it really is an Apple-acknowledged issue, but they've stubbornly not provided any fix.  Frustrating.  \nSummary: Yosemite reads the EDID from the TV that clearly indicates it supports 4K @ 30Hz, and promptly throws it away considering it invalid because it erroneously thinks the pixel clock to be too high (297 MHz).  Once you fix that, though, there's yet another bug in the frame buffer.  Apparently others online have success in Mavericks and it fails in Yosemite and also no problems at all under Windows.  I'm going to try both of those this week, but ... ugh.\nAlso... since the comments indicated that perhaps it had to do with the cable or the TV, I should note that during the initial boot (Apple logo with progress bar), the output is correctly set to 2160p@30Hz.  Likewise if I boot while holding down option, when presented with the options for drives to boot from, that screen is outputed at 2160p@30Hz.  But the moment the login screen is presented, it switches back to 1080p@60Hz.\n\nA: Did you try the final solution on that thread? \n\"Final update. Got my new 2014 Mac Mini now, works w/o problem with my 4k Hisense TV now.\nMaybe, worth a note ...\nInitially, boots in 4k but then switches to 1080p after the OS is loaded.\nTo get 4k at the OS level, one has to do this:\n1.

Note how 50Hz and 60Hz now disappeared from the list\nIt is straightforward to do. But maybe not as intuitive to everybody as Apple may think.\"\n\nA: OSX has a pixel-clock-limit at 165hz that you can overclock.

What is iPhone 6 Plus 128GB 1080p 30fps Maximum Video Time Length?\nIs it \"Available Storage Space,\" or is there already a fixed time limit? Digital Still Cameras are generally restricted to 29 minutes because of tariff restrictions (vs. being categorized as a video camera). Will iPhone 6 Plus do the full 29 minutes, or longer, or is there a shorter technical time limit?\n\nA: I believe limit is only storage space and power.\nFor sure there is no 30 min limit on duration since last time I did 55min video without any interruptions.\nAnd since bitrate of the video is variable depending on the scene there is no fixed time limit per GB either.\n", "Q: Is there a way to read the Spotlight comment in Automator workflow I need to do some clean up on Spotlight comments. Is there a way to read the Spotlight comment, then set it to another value ? For example let's say I need to remove one specific word in the comments. Adding is easy, with Set Spotlight Comments for Finder Items. I'm looking for the opposite action.\n\nA: Since it appears that Automator doesn't have a \"Get Spotlight Comment\" action (surprisingly), maybe you can do this with AppleScript.\n(See this forum)\nSomething like:\ntell application \"Finder\"   \n    set thisItem to \"Macintosh SSD:untitled folder\"\n    set Comm to comment of folder thisItem (* get comment *)\nend tell\nreturn Comm (* to return the Comment string for editing *)\n\nThis returns the Comment (in the Get Info Window) of the specified folder on my Desktop, and could be modified to modify the comment of all items passed in by Automator.\nIn Automator, you'd have to add the action \"Run Applescript\" and insert a script like this there.\nUnfortunately I don't think you can have the script take both the files & new comment as input from the previous Automator action.\nSo you'd probably have to hard-code the comment modification part, and add a set comment part, perhaps like so:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Finder\"   \n        set thisItem to the input as string \n        set Comm to comment of folder thisItem (* get comment *)\n        (* manipulate the comment strings*)\n        set comment of folder thisItem to \"NewCommentString\" (* set comment *)  \n    end tell\n    return input (* to pass the file list to next automator action)\n\nend run\n\nThis script currently only modifies a single file's comment - I believe you'd have to loop through the file list to do it on many files.

I put the firmware restoration CD into my DVD, but the screen remains blank.\n\n\nA year or two ago I had installed rEFIt on my Mac and had it successfully booting to various devices.  At that time I think I had Mac OS X Lion installed.  At some time later I removed rEFIt and installed Mac OS X Mavericks, which worked without a problem.  Then a few days ago I decided to try reinstalling rEFIt (I should have probably used rEFInd instead, but rEFIt had worked previously for me, so that is why I had tried to use it again).  This is when I started having issues with booting into my iMac, but even removing rEFIt and re-initializing my internal hard drive has not resolved the issue.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?  Is there anything else I can do to fix my iMac?  TIA.\nUPDATE:\nPlease note that I clarified the steps I took for firmware repairs in step 10.\nUPDATE 2:\nOK, I now see from here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768 that the long tone from step 10 means that an EFI update is in progress, but even if I leave the computer on for a long time, the update does not appear complete.  How long should it take?  How do I know when it has finished the update?\n\nA: Agree with Tetsujin about doing an SMC reset.\nI recently had the same issue - I had hard-powered-off the computer in the middle of booting, and my system would then just remain black-screened at boot.  Resetting the SMC brought everything back to normal (able to do Recovery Mode, Choose Boot Disk or boot from internal drive as usual).\nHowever, for me to reset the System Management Controller (SMC), the procedure was different.\nFrom Apple, for computer without removable battery: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer. \n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to\nthe Mac if its not already connected.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option\nkeys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.\n\n\nNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\n( SMC reset: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 )\nThis immediately solved my booting issues (just last week).  Good luck.\n\nA: All I can think of that you may have missed in the 'standard suite' of things to try first would be Reset SMC...\nShut down the computer.\nUnplug the computer's power cord.\nWait fifteen seconds.\nAttach the computer's power cord.\nWait five seconds, then press the power button to turn on the computer.  \n", "Q: Complete Time Machine restore is only partially recovering my files I recently renamed my home folder on my new MacBook Pro (Retina, 13\"). I restarted my computer not realising that it would result in a complete wipe of my drive. Previously having backed it up with Time Machine, I wasn't too worried though.\nLooking through the Time Machine backup files, I also did see everything I had had previously saved, and since I have the backup on an external, I restarted the computer and pressed command+R to perform a complete restore.\nAbout 78% through it seemed as if my external drive had failed (not responding, no progress). However, after a few moments my MacBook said the restore had been successful and restarted. Upon logging in, however, I saw that two very important folders were messed up - both of these I had added to the sidebar and the dock. Now, one of them was missing completely (a question mark in its place on the dock) and the other only had one file in it from a day ago. \nAlarmed, I tried restoring the computer again, with the same results. Now even the backup files on my external don't have intact versions of the two folders. Furthermore, none of the data for my apps or any of my settings seem to have carried over.\nIf there's any way I can recover the two files, I'd love to know.\n\nA: Launch the Time Machine App, you may see the time line show you backup time, you can navigate the \"important folders\" at any backup time.\nif you find the files you want, just restore it manually.\n\nA: Sorry to hear that, founds quite frustrating.\nRegarding\n\nI recently renamed my home folder on my new MacBook Pro (Retina, 13\").\n  I restarted my computer not realising that it would result in a\n  complete wipe of my drive.\n\nThis should not have 'wiped' anything - but indeed the system will have difficulty logging in properly because the home folder contains all your user's login preferences etc.  (Apple really should pop up a warning if you rename your home folder.)\nIf you had just reverted the name of the home folder, you should have been golden (eg. by booting in Command-S single-user mode, mounting the drives as instructed, and \n mv /Users/HomeFolder_NewName /Users/HomeFolder_OriginalName\n\nRegarding getting your files back, try the full TimeMachine Timeline restore as suggested above by nelson.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the folder that is missing files.\n\n*Choose \"Enter Time Machine\" from the Time Machine menu item.  This\nshould pull up the timeline of items in that folder.\n\n*Scroll back through the timeline until you see that the folder is\nfully populated,\n\n*Then choose \"restore\".  You may need to select all the files in the\nfolder and then choose \"Restore\" to bring back all those files.\n\n\nOne issue I can foresee is if your backup drive was kind of full, maybe it's deleted some older backups - perhaps including the one with these missing files (would only happen if you ran a TM backup after the Full Restore as well).\nGood luck.\n", "Q: AirPlay YouTube from OS X Can you AirPlay YouTube from OS X to a Bose and Apple TV?\n\nA: You have many ways to do this, but the easiest or simplest way to do this would be to mirror your whole display to the apple TV using the icon in your status bar, if you already have air play mirroring set up. If you don't have it set up go to system preferences > display and there should be an option in your lower left-hand corner. Unlike in iOS, airplay isn't really targeted towards specific apps. I don't really know about the Bose thing, but if you're referring to a sound system, as long as it's hooked up to your TV you should be fine. If you mirror and the sound still plays from your computer try changing the output in system preferences > sound\n\n\n", "Q: Cannot log in with Apple ID after performing password reset My wife forgot the password to her Apple ID account. Her Macbook Air (OS X Yosemite) restarted to install some updates.

I once tried that when I forgot the password, and within minutes the problem solved.\n\nA: In my experience the below is right except that you don't need to restart your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to login to your iCloud account online and set your primary email back to the original one (your computer is still using this email) reset the password if you would like.\n\n*Now restart your computer and you should be able to log back in.\n\n*Once you are logged in, go back to iCloud website and change back to your new email.\n\n*Before you log off your computer go to Setting>iCloud and remove the old iCloud account and add the new iCloud account.*\n\n", "Q: Boot Camp - Can't download the software because of a network problem I have spent 20 hours trying to install Windows 8.1 pro 64 bit on my MacBook Pro Retina MGXC2B/A\nI created a ISO image of my Windows dvd, put it on my desktop.\nInside Boot Camp it asks for the Iso Image, I set this to read the ISO file on my desktop\nInside the Task Status window, I see the text \"formatting selected drive...\", which then changes to \"Copying Windows files...\"\nWhen the loading % bar in this window reaches around 50%, a window pops up stating.\nCan't download the software because of a network problem\n\nI have tried this 10 times now, its the same error over and over, there is nothing wrong with my internet connection or networking, what is the issue?\n\nA: UPDATE: How to download and install the driver files without using Bootcamp.\nUsing the web site How to identify MacBook Pro models, I determined your computer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n*Model Identifier MacBook Pro11,3\n\n*Configuration 15.4”/2.5 Quad-core i7/16GB/512-Flash\n\n*Model number MGXC2xx/A\n\n\nOther Mac computers use one of the links below:\nHow to identify your MacBook Air\nHow to identify MacBook models\nHow to identify iMac models\nHow to identify Mac mini models\nHow to identify Mac Pro models\nFrom here, I went to the web site: Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems to determine which driver files to download.\nThe files, you need to download for your MacBook Pro, can be found at: Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5640\nThis should give you an alternative to downloading from Bootcamp.\n\nI believe \"the creation of the usb install flash drive\" can be separated from \"the download of the drivers.\" You should be able to install windows first, then install the drivers later. This is what I did with my clean install of the windows 8 operating system. I believe this is still true. \"See Install Windows support software\" in the Install Windows on your Mac.\nIf you are having network problems, can you continue the install without having the \"Download the latest Windows support software for Apple\" box checked off? \nIf you do get windows to install without the downloaded drivers installed, you will need to be able to boot back to OS X. This can be done by holding down the option key at startup, then selecting OS X. Once, the drivers are installed, you will be able to do this from the desktop.\n\nA: I ran into this issue just now and fixed it. My computer used to be managed by my company and the catalogURL was changed to a company owned update server.\nI fixed it by resetting it:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\n\nA: \"network problem\" means: \"I tried to download stuff, but it failed for some sort of reason you can't fix and neither can I, good luck and try again\".\nSo basically, it might be a problem at Apple's distribution servers, a problem in the API providing the BootCamp assistant with the latest data on how to download the right files, or it could be a problem with a request timeout. There are so many things between an app trying to download something and the whole chain up to Apple's download server that could have gone wrong. It doesn't mean your internet is completely broken or that your network cable is bent just a bit too far ;)\nJust go ahead and use the option to create install media without Bootcamp, and download the drivers yourself. If you have an older MBP with installation media, one of the disks is Windows-readable and contains a version of the BootCamp drivers as well. It's usually printed on the disk. Those hybrid disks were used up until one of the recent versions of the MBP that had a SuperDrive, just before Internet Recovery became a thing.\n\nA: This happened to me the first time I download. I just tried again and it worked. \n\nA: I download the files directly from\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1721?locale=en_US\nI unzipped the folder and added its subdirectories directly to the partially completed windows 10 efi boot that the bootcamp assistant had made (before it crapped out)\n", "Q: Prevent Finder from launching when quitting all applications I have enabled the option to quit Finder. However, if Finder is the only remaining open app and I quit it, it will launch again.\nPersonally I don't find the scenario of having all apps closed that nonsensical... I might want to close everything, and then open a different set of apps (because I switched from coding to making music, for example)\nCan I prevent this behavior?\n\nA: If you open Terminal and enter \"launchctl list\" it will list all of the programs kept running by launchd, the \"launch daemon\" that keeps system software running even after it is quit/force quit/killed/crashed.\nScroll to the top the results, and you will see \"com.apple.Finder\" keeping the Finder always running as long as the OS is running. Finder does much more than browse the file system, and it should always be running (same for the Dock). However, if you want to quit it and keep it from relaunching, you will need to remove it from launchctl first. I wouldn't do this personally, but here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Enter: sudo launchctl remove com.apple.Finder\n\n*Enter your password and hit return.\n\n\nNow you should be able to quit Finder without it relaunching.\nTo undo this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Enter: sudo launchctl load System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist\n\n*Enter your password and hit return.\n\n\nA: You can quit Finder using the AppleScript command tell application \"Finder\" to quit. It will stay quit until you launch it again with tell application \"Finder\" to launch (or tell it to activate), or click on its Dock icon.\nThe AppleScript commands can be issued from the command line, using\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to activate'\n\nFrom Terminal, with the normal PATH settings, you can save some typing by leaving off the /usr/bin/ part, but when writing shell scripts it's prudent to spell out all commands using full paths.\nWhen Finder quits normally, as above, launchd will not automatically respawn it. If it quits abnormally, for example using kill or killall or via force quit, or if it crashes, launchd will respawn it immediately.\nMost of the important work Finder did in the background has been shifted to System Events or to Dock. The split between Finder and System Events is basically that System Events has taken over manipulation of files and folders, leaving Finder to focus on just their visual appearance. When an AppleScript tells Finder to do something that is now System Events' responsibility, Finder just passes the request along, but still gets launched along the way.\nBut generally, the only reason to quit Finder is to manipulate something behind its back, for example in the common sequence\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder ...\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to launch\n\nor because you've just gone into System Preferences→Language & Region to change your language defaults and want Finder to start using the new settings.\nI can't think of a reason to make Finder stay quit. If you're worried about visual clutter, just hide it. If you're worried about CPU usage, it doesn't use any while it's hidden (except to respond to Apple Events), and not much while it's not. Time-consuming tasks like copying files or emptying the trash get passed off to the background process racoon. \nIf you're worried about its RAM usage, it doesn't use much (under 45MB on my system), and since Mavericks it supports Sudden Termination. If the system sees it's not doing anything (because it's hidden, for example) and has a use for the RAM (for example, to delay having to start swapping to disk), it'll silently quit it without telling you. The Dock will continue to show it as running, but Activity Monitor will show that it actually isn't. \n", "Q: How I can activate the iPhone which is asking for credentials I don't remember?

Again, this article is for Linux, but I assume TestDisk will work the same on both operating systems.\nIf it works, the first link will give you the cleanest, most-direct fix.\nUsing the last two links, you should still be able to fix the disk by first formatting the partition table to some universal format like FAT and then running your OSX recovery program to reformat the disk as it sees fit.\nIf you do go with the last two links, I would recommend trying to run PhotoRec on it first just in case you're able to recover any useful data with it. PhotoRec is made by the same folks who made TestDisk, but it's easier to use and is designed to just bruit force scan the disk and automatically pick out files that it can recover — actually \"bruit force\" might not be the right word here since that's just one of the options, but you get my point. :)\nGood luck!\n\nA: I replaced the drive with a new one.\n", "Q: Connect to second Wifi network using dongle I have a Macbook Pro running Yosemite (10.10.1) and an Asus wifi dongle.\nI would like to connect to two wifi networks.

On the Mac, Safari only sends the systemwide preferred languages.\nTo change it:  → System Preferences → Language & Region.\nBeware that doing this will change the locale used by your operating system.\nOn the other hand, in iOS 10 the systemwide language is set separately from the app-and-website preferred languages. Both can be found under Settings → General → Language & Region.\n\nA: \nYou can also turn Location Services off altogether by deselecting Enable Location Services in the Privacy pane of Security & Privacy preferences.

Both where being used as backups for the most part with a few files. Thank you for your time. \n\nA: If your disks have non-critical data you can live without, and you just want to wipe them clean, use Disk Utility. If you're not in a rush use the Secure Erase/Zero Fill option as this will take any bad sectors out of use that may have formed since you acquired the drives.\nAlternatively, if you have data you really need to access, try DiskWarrior as it can repair many disk issues that Disk Utility/FSCK can't.\n\nA: If you have essential data on the drive and do not want to erase it you can usually copy all your data to another drive using FreeFileSync. It's free, extremely stable, and has a user friendly interface. It also gives you constant progress reports which is very reassuring. \nI used this on a 2TB Time Machine drive that failed and could not be repaired with DiskWarrior and was hard to even mount. Owing to the damage to the drive it took a week to transfer about 800 GB comprised of 2.5 million files, slowing to a crawl or pausing for a couple of minutes.\nNormally it's extremely fast for making large copies.\n", "Q: rMBP kernel_task spikes when connecting more than one external monitor When connecting a second external monitor kernel_task spikes to 600%+.

I no longer use this service, but finder still tries to connect to it automatically at every startup, I'm not sure how to delete this server from the list of servers finder tries to connect to automatically. How do I do that?\nSome things I have tried: It has been removed from favorite servers and I also cleared the recent servers list in the \"Connect to Server\" menu. This had no effect.\n\nA: Just hold the ⌘ button down, click and hold on the item you wish to remove, and drag it off the Finder’s window.\nAdditionally you should try Go → Connect to Server (⌘+K).

My question is, is this common behavior? Is there any workaround (except for saving it to non-hidden+copy/paste), or some hidden setting?\nEDIT: adding picture\nas below suggestted, typing / you can specify your directory, providing you know the exact path, but what if there are more than 1 hidden files in your path? On the left is save panel without hidden directories, on the right Finder with enabled hidden directories.\n\n\nA: Referring to the screenshot in your original question: Just drag the folder (_EXTERNAL_DATA...) from your Finder window on the right into the save dialog on the left. The save dialog will now be sitting at the folder you dragged into it.\nIf you have already opened the folder in your Finder window, just drag the little folder icon from the Finder window's title bar (the one directly to the left of the window title) instead.\nI quite like the 'Go to folder' solution in another answer, but if you already have the other window open, I think this is even quicker.\n\nA: The built in way to do this by using a key combination when in the save/open dialogs to toggle the hidden files to visible or hidden\n\nUpdate: This shortcut works in all views, But in column view it does not update the view to show the change until you navigate to another directory.\nNot sure why this is the behaviour.\nBut you can toggle it in column view click on another folder (in the parent column on the left) and back to see it has changed.\n\nWhen you are in the Save or Open Dialogue of the app.  \nPress and hold the CMD + shift  and then .  keys at the same time.\nThis will toggle hidden files/folders in the  Save or Open Dialogue.\n\n[toggled to hide invisible files/folder]\n\n\n[toggled to Show invisible files/folder]\n\n\nNote: You do not need to have hidden files/folders set to visible in the finder\nThis toggle works independently. \n\nA: Pressing ⌘⇧G (Cmd+Shift+G) in any Finder window or standard file open/save dialog will bring up a little prompt:\n\n\n\nYou can enter any path you want into this prompt. Using ⌘⇧G to get to this prompt will show the last path you entered, which is very handy for saving multiple files to the same hidden destination.\nIn Open or Save dialogs you can also get to this prompt by pressing either the ~ or / keys, which will prefill the dialog with ~ (home directory) or / (root directory) automatically. The advantage of using Cmd+Shift+G is that this key combination will remember the last path you typed in, and it works in Finder too (~ and / prefill the dialog and only work in Open or Save dialogs).\nFurthermore, the prompt supports a limited form of tab-completion; pressing Tab in the window will autocomplete the path using the alphabetically-first entry that starts with whatever you typed. This can be very handy for quickly navigating your filesystem even when the files aren't hidden.\n\nA: Which version of OS X are you using?\nWhen I tested this on Yosemite, if I entered ~ or / it brought up this:\n\nin which you can enter the path to the directory of your choice.\nAlso if you just put in the directory such as\n\n~/Library\n\nThen it will take the file selector to that directory and allow you to drill down.\n\nA: What if you add said hidden folder to the Finder sidebar?  It will then show up in an open/save panel.\nFor example, I mess around in ~/Library from time to time, enough that I added it to the sidebar.  Now, when I go to and open or save panel, I'm able to jump right to it.\n\nA: Side note: if you use DefaultFolderX (which has lots of other handy features), you can set an 'advanced option' so that all you need to hold is the Option key when selection Open or Save to be able to access all files/folders.\n", "Q: Bandwidth limiting in Yosemite I get disconnected from the internet whenever the speed reaches 2.5 Mbps\nIs there any app to limit the internet speed below that.

The drive will always be something like /dev/disk2, so the script only needs to eject the specific volume name.\nI would suggest ejecting it at the end of your day versus after a single backup.

It should be empty except for an Extensions.plist file.\n/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Safari/Extensions\n\nYou mentioned extensions but not plugins. Within Safari's preferences go to the Security tab and click on the button \"Website Settings...\" beside \"Internet plug-ins\". Uncheck anything you don't recognise there and try again. Especially, obviously, anything enabled for Google's sites.\nAnother thing to check is the proxy settings on your Mac. A quick way to access these is from the Advanced tab in Safari's preferences. There should be a \"Change Settings...\" button beside \"Proxies\" near the bottom of that tab that will launch System Preferences and take you right to the proxy settings. Hard to give you guidance beyond this, but look for any proxy settings that you haven't configured yourself.\nOne last thing to check for is malicious or buggy kernel extensions. While it's unlikely on Yosemite (as kernel extensions now need to be signed to load) it might be worth checking anyway.

I created a second partition. Format is Free Space.\nHow do I undo this? As in, I want to have just one primary partition \"Macintosh HD\" \nI've tried:\n1) In Disk Utility, I select the partition tab. The \"-\" character is greyed out. As in, it cant be clicked on.\n2) Rebooted in Recovery mode (CMD+SHIFT+R) and did above. Same result. The partition cannot be removed. The \"-\" button is greyed out.

If you look there, you see that only 125.4 GB of space is allocated to the \"Core Storage\". Disk 1 is the logical volume (Macintosh HD) which resides in disk0s2 (also named Macintosh HD) so deleting disk1 won't be what you want to accomplish and the tool is preventing you from deleting that \"logical device\".\nYou can fix this with the cs subcommand of diskutil in terminal to remove the core storage and put things back on disk0s2 in a none-CoreStorage format.\nFor safety's sake, make a good backup before continuing and then revert the core storage volume:\ndiskutil cs revert 8F5A679C-06AB-44CC-BD46-33E327446D80\n\nNow let the machine revert to none-CoreStorage layout. Once that's done, you can use the Disk Utility and or diskutil to resize disk0s2 to take up all the space. Then you would re-enable file vault if you want core storage going forward. This may take more time than wiping the drive and reinstalling the OS and restoring your backup - but you will learn more by using diskutil and not need to test your backup now if you've never restored it.\nI personally don't see any benefit to using Core Storage unless it's for encryption, but you're free to do so. Also, there is an undocumented diskutil cs resizeStack operation that I'd be hesitant to rely upon, but if you don't care to lose the data, might be a one trick pony to get your resize done.\nI'd just revert the core storage to normal storage and then grow your normal partition using Disk Utility from reading the various comments and your initial post closely.\n\nA: For safety's sake, make a good backup before continuing.\nI really agree with @bmike, I'd like to say, \"re-enable file vault\" is a bad idea, because it's Unencrypted originally, and also \"file vault 2\" has so many horrible bugs.\nif every thing is OK, diskutil cs resizeStack 8F5A679C-06AB-44CC-BD46-33E327446D80 0g should work\n", "Q: Total memory doesn't add up in Activity Monitor My computer's been really slow, to the point where it's almost unusable, and according to Activity Monitor, it's because the physical memory's basically all being used (the CPU usage is fine). However, the processes' memory don't all add up to the total memory usage reported by Activity Monitor (I did show all processes, not just the user's). Where is the extra memory usage coming from?\n\n\nA: The overall picture of your RAM is that it's healthy and there is no memory pressure. Something else is the bottleneck causing slowness.\nOnle 2 GB of RAM is used for App Memory and less than a gig of File Cache and Wired Memory seems fine. Some IO would be faster if you had more File Cache, so you could try quitting Apps you don't need, but I'd focus on the CPU and Disk/Network tabs of Activity Monitor and start benchmarking the things that are slow.\nWhat are you waiting for?

In my old MacBook Pro the screen powered on immediately on pressing a key to wake from sleep and if I was waking from sleep by opening the laptop lid the screen was on before the lid was open.\nI have Yosemite 10.10.1, the old MacBook had Mavericks.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Maybe the excerpt below can explain.\nThe full article can be found on OS X Daily, Is Your Mac Slow to Wake from Sleep? Try this pmset Workaround:\n\nIf your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air feels slow to wake from sleep after it’s been sleeping for a while, there may be a fairly simple cause: standby mode. Standby mode allows a Mac to potentially have up to 30 days of ‘standby’ time, meaning it can sit in a prolonged sleep state for that long before draining the battery. Basically, standby (and sleep) works by dumping everything out of active RAM into a sleep image file on the hard drive, and then when the Mac wakes from sleep that sleep image file is copied back from the hard drive to RAM. You may have guessed this already, but the reason some Macs take a long time to wake from sleep is that process of copying contents of sleepimage back into memory, and typically the more RAM you have in a Mac the slower the process can be. As you can imagine, it can take a while to copy 8GB or 16GB of data anywhere, even when a Mac has a super fast SSD drive it’s reading from.\n\n", "Q: Can't Sync m4b files to iPod My m4b audiobook will NOT sync to my ipod.

I just bought a MBP 13\" mid 2014 with a 128 GB SSD.\nWhen doing a disk speed test with the Black Magic Design-app, I only get about 210 MB/s write and about 510-550 MB/s read.\nAll the benchmark videos I have seen using the same app all get about 310 MB/s write and up to 700 MB/s read.\nIs there something wrong with my disk? The computer seems fine in daily use but I want the performance I paid for.\n\nA: Well if it is not the state of you disk it could easily be just a different SSD vendor. Those figures you have provided are from testing SanDisk 128GB equipped ones.\nApple has many different vendors for same part and some SSD chipsets are faster at sequential than other. It might just be the case. Here is an article on similar discrepancy over 2013 and 2014 MBAs\n\nFor many years, Apple has used different suppliers for the solid-state\n  drives (SSDs) in its MacBook Air models, with drive performance\n  varying among manufacturer brands. A recent study by Macworld\n  demonstrated rather dramatic differences in SSD read and write speeds\n  between tested 2013 and 2014 models, but at the time it was unclear\n  whether the poorer performance for the 2014 models was still simply\n  due to drive brand variances or if there was something specific to the\n  2014 machines causing an overall degradation in performance.\n\nIf it is the case then what you can do is either sell it and find SanDisk equipped one or bring it back to Apple if you are in 14 days window (you would have to pay restocking fee though. No you can't claim that you are not getting performance you have paid for because Apple is only advertising its performance as “up to” figures)\nOn the other hand if you are not working with high def video on this machine and SSD I wouldn't bother since those sequential speeds are only good for that. And that tool is from company that is creating pricey tools for movie production btw.\n\nA: No there is nothing wrong with the disk:\n- you can have another file size than what is used in the \"specs\"\n- you can have a rather full disk and the GarbageCollection was not fully done.\nPlease let your computer sleep overnight, without any software running, this will help your GarbageCollection;\nmake sure you have enough free disk space for the Garbage collection, let's say 20%.\n\nA: Your Mac already has a disk read/write speeds report in the Activity Monitor.\nSince it is a dynamic value you need to start a app that reads/writes to the disk, or use Terminal for that:\nTo test write speed:\ntime dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024\n\nIn the output, you should look for something that looks like \"bytes transferred in 16.546732 secs (519131791 bytes/sec).\" Copy and paste the bytes/sec speed into Google to convert to MB/s (e.g. Google search for \"519131791 bytes/s in megabytes/s\").\nTo test read speed:\n dd if=tstfile bs=1024k of=/dev/null count=1024\n\nsample from my Activity monitor:\n\n", "Q: Console log flooded with discoveryd errors.

I doubt very much you have a firmware \"bug\", memory failure is much more likely and would explain the unusual hardware behaviour you're experiencing.\nI had the same model which I initially bought around 5 years ago, this had the original OS installed (10.5.6). Immediately after purchase I used the install discs to wipe the machine totally clear of the previous owner's setup, no problems encountered during installation. \nEverything seemed to generally work ok (one or two occasional random crashes) until I decided to wipe it clean following the retail release of 10.6. After trying (and failing) several times to install 10.6 I decided to substitute the factory 1GB RAM stick with a 512MB stick from another laptop. This time 10.6 installed perfectly, first go. Faulty memory explained the random crashes as well as the installation issues with 10.6. Incidentally, I tried running the machine after installing 10.6 with its original 1GB RAM. It would sometimes boot but was completely unpredictable - single user mode was always accessible though, like your setup.\n", "Q: Change \"Third Party Content\" answer for app in iTunes Connect I submitted an app to the App Store yesterday, but now realize I should change by answer I checked for the \"Third Party\" content Yes/No question.\nIs there an easy way to do that?

I tried verifying the version in terminal:\nmanfred$ java --version\n-bash: java: command not found\n\nI think there's a conflict between two versions or something perhaps. How can I solve this?\n\nA: Looks like Java is not in the path.  I do something like this in my ~/.bash_profile\n# Get Java Home for the specific version\nJAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.8 2>/dev/null`\n# Add Java to the path\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nQuit terminal once you create or edit ~/.bash_profile.

Is their any file modification or app that will work around this?  Like to switch throughout the day from a sit down desk to stand up and bringing the power adapter back and forth, is becoming more of a hassle.\n\nA: You can use Insomniax to disable sleep when the display is closed. This will mean that you can close the lid and display the screen on a secondary monitor mode without needing to have a power adapter connected as the Mac will not sleep when you close the lid.\n\nInsomniax is now abandonware and no further updates or binaries will be supplied.

I couldn't find a native option to do that - do I need to download an app for that?\n\nA: Getting the 'full path' to a file on a non-jailbroken device is not useful as you can't access the file directly anyway. Generally, this is not possible, although you may be able to infer the location of a specific file.\nFor what it's worth, the full path to an image in your camera roll is:\n/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/###APPLE/IMG_####.png\n", "Q: Remove dropbox icon from Finder toolbar The dropbox icon keeps reappearing in my finder toolbar, no matter how many times I Command Drag it off, or remove it in customize toolbar.

I can't get Finder to do a darn thing. Specifically, it won't open new windows, show files on the desktop, or be the app in focus when I click its dock icon or the desktop. \nWeird! Fine, I'll relaunch Finder. That usually clears it up. \nEr:\n\nI can hit 'relaunch' on both of those Finder items, and it changes nothing. Neither did restarting the computer. \nApps can still manipulate files, and Alfred can open them - but not find them. \nThere are zero Finder processes open according to Activity Monitor:\n\nWhat are my next troubleshooting steps?\n\nA: Try restarting the LaunchServices database.

This should show if the process or processes are actually still running as the force quit dialog can sometimes be stale. Furthermore, you can check for Finder instances by running the following:\nsudo ps -ax | grep Finder | grep -v grep\n\nThis will show the path to any Finder which is currently running and also provide the PID.\nYou can also try booting into Safe Mode (hold Shift on boot). This should rebuild the LastApplicationState for Finder (and clear caches) which may allow it to launch correctly next time you boot normally.\nFull discussion in chat\n", "Q: OS X Messages.app, cmd+shift+w not working On my new mac, \nI have noticed in Messages.app, I can no longer purge message threads via cmd+shift+w like I could on my old computer.

I am seeing 2 accounts on my login screen. One is my account and the other has the name \"Other\". What account is that? When I click on it, there is no username. When I try to shut down my computer, I am now prompted to enter my username and password. Previously there is no need to do so. I have tried the suggestion here How to get rid of the \"Other...\"-Account on the login screen? but that only hides the \"Other\" account.

Where do I set what my game is optimized for? Do I need to provide iPhone 6 and 6 Plus screenshots?\nWhat about iPad screenshots? The compatibility mode screenshots don't look great.\n\nA: When you optimized you app to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus you have to add new image and icon sizes in your assets. If you select Images.xcassets in your project and then select your AppIcon and hit ⌥+⌘+0 you must see something like that:\n\nIf you have selected iOS 8.0 and Later Sized you will have to provide screenshots for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, in other case, it won't be necessary.\n", "Q: Using Terminal to order SSID preference in System Preferences I'd like to find a way to add a specific SSID to the top of the preferred WiFi networks in System Preferences > Network > WiFi > Advanced. (10.9 Mavericks and beyond)\nAccording to the man page, this should do it:\n\n-addpreferredwirelessnetworkatindex hardwareport network index securitytype [password]\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear the 'index' aspect actually sets one network name above the other. Is there a way to set this via terminal and/or run via bash?\n\nA: A couple of things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Supposedly, specifying 0 for the index puts it at the front of the list.\n\n*You need at least admin privilege and may need root privilege. Have you tried it with:\nsudo networksetup -addpreferredwirelessnetworkatindex ...?\n\n*If the wireless network is already a preferred network, you may need to remove it first before adding it again. That is, it may be ignoring the index if the network already has an index. Assuming your wireless port is en1, you can get the list of preferred networks with:\nnetworksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks en1. I admit that I'm just guessing here.\n\n*If you have multiple wireless ports, it will of course make a difference which one you add this service to. You can list all your hardwareports, wireless and otherwise, with: \nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\n", "Q: New Finder window opens maximized every time For some reason, now every time I start Finder or ask for a new window, it occupies my entire screen (note this is not full screen mode, it is just normal screen mode but the Finder is resized maximally to fit the entire visible area, except the bar at the top).\nI tried resizing this Finder window and closing, then restarting but end up getting a new Finder window that is resized occupying my entire workspace.\nAny idea how to troubleshoot this? \nRunning Yosemite latest on MBP retina 13.\n\nA: Open a new window, resize it, then immediately close it. That tells Finder to remember the new size for all new windows. No need to throw away all of your preferences just to change one.\n\nA: This problem is usually caused by the preference, you can try to remove the plist file temporarily. This file is in the directory ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n", "Q: Changed Username, Broke Everything I changed a username in Yosemite, and now everything under that username is wrecked.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Chrome won't work at all, saying it can't read or write to a data file.   \n\n*All of my son's Minecraft data is lost, and the minecraft launcher won't run, saying something about Java not being able to set up a directory.   \n\n\nBoth these things run fine under all other usernames.  Also, I can't establish Read/Write permissions for any folders at all, though the problem username is an admin account, and I have all the passwords to unlock the permissions manually and changed them in the \"get info\" area, and have changed them many times, the change never sticks.  \nI have tried Repair permissions, in the disk utility, and that hasn't worked either. How can I salvage Minecraft or possibly all user data?\n\nA: When you changed your username, did you also change the name of your home folder. Without more information, my best guess would be that you changed your username by going to System Preferences→Users & Groups, right clicking on your account and choosing \"Advanced Options\". There are fields there where you can change your username (inexplicably labeled \"Account name\") and your home directory.\nYou should never change either of these for the account you're currently logged in as! Log in as a different user.\nChanging the \"Home directory\" field only changes where the account looks for its home directory. It does not actually rename the folder. \nContinuing to guess, I will surmise that that's exactly what you did. You wanted to change your username from oldyou to newyou and at the same time changed the name of your home folder from /Users/oldyou to /Users/newyou, but made the change only in the dialog, not on disk. The next time you logged in, the system noticed your home folder (/Users/newyou) was not present, so it made one for you as if for a new user.\nThe good news is that your old home folder, /Users/oldyou, is still there with all your data (Minecraft included), exactly as you left it.\nThere are two possible paths you can take here, both depending on your still being able to perform admin functions.\nOne method is to go back to System Preferences and change the \"Home directory\" field back to /Users/oldyou. You'll have to restart, but when you log in all your data will be back. You'll have a now-useless folder /Users/newyou, which you can delete.\nIt'll mean that the name of your home folder no longer conforms to the  /Users/username convention, but that should be OK. It's just a convention, and only poorly written software will get confused by it. Sadly, we live in a world where poorly written software exists.\nWhich leads to the second method for resolving your problem. If you can still create accounts, make a new admin account. In that account, delete /Users/newyou and rename /Users/oldyou to /Users/newyou.\nThese folders are marked as deny delete, which also means you can't rename them. (Renaming is tantamount to deleting and then adding.) Finder probably won't even let you try. You can do it from Terminal, though, by first:\nsudo mv /Users/newyou /Users/trashme\nsudo mv /Users/oldyou /Users/newyou\n\nBe sure you've replaced newyou and oldyou with the proper names. Verify that you can log in to your newyou account. Once you're sure that everything is working as it should, you can delete the /Users/trashme folder with:\nsudo rm -rf /User/trashme\n\nBe very sure you've entered that exactly as I've given it. Copy/paste might be a good idea. Punctuation, including spaces, is very important here.\n", "Q: About to sell my 2013 rMac. Is 3 pass zero enough? I plan on selling my late 2013 rMBP  soon. I was wondering what your opinions are on me using a 3 pass zero on a SSD? Is it enough? I do have some sensitive data on there (bank info, passwords to important things at work, etc.). I also don't want to damage the SSD because I hear these passes can hurt the hard drive. Apple said that I don't even need to do that because SSD are just that great. Is that true? \nThank you. \n\nA: I believe Apple's position is a standard erase is good enough on SSD. In the article on secure erasing, they recommend enabling FileVault before you ever introduce any sensitive data to the drive so that you can just throw away the encryption key and not need any passes of erase to be secure.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201949\nThat being said, in your situation, I wouldn't do a 3 pass erase on an SSD and I also wouldn't do a simple erase with no passes. \nInstead, I'd turn on FileVault 2 (Assuming you have a newer OS) and then boot to recovery mode and repartition the drive. Be sure to not unlock the drive but simply repartition it to an empty HFS+ partition, no passes needed.\nThat ensures that each writable block is totally encrypted and randomized so that it's impossible to tell what was free space and what was files, let alone do data recovery.\nThe passes are a marginal hit on the drive's life (they are rated for hundreds to thousands of passes), but one complete wipe might be as much wear as three months of heavy use. What makes the passes worthless is they waste your time and are un-necessary additional wear on a consumable part (the SSD).\n\nA: Three passes is akin to slamming on your brakes and screeching to a halt in your car. Your tires will be fine but you've just left a few hundred miles of rubber on the road. Chances are you hit the brakes for a good reason though so it was worth it.\nYou won't damage the SSD. Yosemite's 3 pass includes 2 passes of randomized data, which is very much like repartitioning the drive with FileVault turned on. There's little harm in even going to 7. Hopefully you encrypted sensitive data anyway. Recovering that won't do anyone any good assuming the encryption and password were fairly strong.\n", "Q: How to launch web start on 10.10 OSX My wife is taking an online class and it says it needs to launch using Java Web Start.

However, I want other processes to be running on admin user account while I'm logged in to user with limited privileges. Is this possible or do I have to be logged in to the admin user to run the processes?\n\nA: The services that are installed/managed via Mac OS X Server can run in the background and do not require a GUI login session. The Server application itself is just a config/monitoring tool and does not need to be running for the services to run. So it is quite OK to run those services and have a limited user logged into a GUI session.\n", "Q: Backup Encryption Password My IPad 2 crashed recently and I was forced to upgrade to IOS8.

When I would click something, it wouldn't register and I'd have to click repeatedly for it to actually work. Additionally, when I'm highlighting text, I'll still be holding onto the left click, but it'll cut out and I'll have to press down harder for it to continue registering.\nThe left clicking I use is the physical pressing down of the track pad. I prefer this method to the magic clicking because my hand can accidentally touch my track pad without it clicking on something eslse while I'm typing.\nI thought my problem might be a minor fluke so I restarted my computer multiple times in an attempt to fix it, but nothing happened. I went through forums and only found problems vaguely similar to mine. None seem to have the problem of left clicking just cutting out randomly. Some forum posts suggested running an Apple Hardware Test and mine came back clear. Others have said to make sure there's no external mouse on bluetooth, but I don't have one.\nI plugged a USB mouse in to make sure that left clicking as a whole wasn't a problem and it worked fine. I just want to know if anyone's had a similar problem and if there were any solutions to it before I take my computer in to the Geek Squad. I have a plan with them already, so there's no additional money being spent on taking my computer in, but I'd hate to have to waste their time and be away from my computer when I have school work to do on it.\n\nA: It was my Magic Mouse. I turned it off and the problem was resolved. I had my mouse in a box with some other things that must have accidentally shifted and was pressing on the button. Once I found it and turned the mouse off, everything was fine.\n\nA: Does the trackpad click feel normal? Does the trackpad feel recessed or sunken at all?\nThere are two possibilities here:\n1) trackpad needs to be adjusted - there is a little adjustment screw when you take off the bottom case - sometimes it needs to be turned to make better contact with the trackpad. Apple will usually adjust this for free in the store as an attempt to fix the clock issue. \n2) the trackpad is failing. What you described is a classic symptom. You might need to have it replaced. \nThere is a trackpad diagnostic that Apple stores have. Make an appointment and go in. It's free. \n\nA: I've noticed that I've been having a similar issue with the trackpad on my 2011 Macbook Pro. I thought rebooting would solve the issue and it did the other day. Today I noticed that the issue came back, rebooted and it was still there. That's when it dawned on me that it was more complex than I had thought.\nI did some trouble shooting and  I realized that I had recently started using a Magic Mouse recently. So I decided to turn off my bluetooth antenna and it seems to have fixed the issue. I would say that my Magic Mouse must have sent some sort of \"frozen click\" message that was resolved when I turned off bluetooth. Don't know if this applies to your situation but so far, its resolved my issue.\n\nA: I have this left click not working issue on both my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) and newer laptops with Touch force.\nMine will do this. If I use an external bluetooth trackpad and click, it will work and so will my internal track pad.  I use two external track pads. One is left at work and the other left at home.\nMy boss' laptop did this as well and a USB Mouse did not work either. I somehow got it fixed by logging into another user. And after the mouse was working, I reset bluetooth using SHIFT+OPTION on the Bluetooth Menu and Debug Menu-> and removed all bluetooth devices. Then rebooted to her user and things have been fine since.\nSometimes Zapping the P-RAM will work. Reboot Command-Option-P-R\nThis is a concern as it is not limited to just one type of Mac laptop.  Recovery Mode does not fix it. It seems to be a hardware problem and it may or may not be a stuck mouse. The hardware device might just think one is. My guess this is really bluetooth radio interference which runs a similar band as WiFi. So there could a signal that the Mac receives thinking a left click is on somewhere and that disables the real device.  One thing you will notice when this happens, right click still works. \n\nA: Check your Mac's system report by clicking the Apple logo located in the top left corner of Mac OS then check the power tab and note your battery health condition to ensure it is normal.  If it is not, your battery may be failing and it's cores are expanding thereby putting pressure on the bottom of your trackpad.\nI had this happen to me on my Mid 2010 MacBook Pro a little over a year ago and replaced the battery to relieve the pressure on my trackpad, now everything is running great.\n\nA: It might be caused, by a bluetooth link between another unknown mous. and that mous to be put under something, so it's left click i presed. essentially holding left click. It can be fixed by stopping bluetooth, or forgetting the device from the bluetooth menu.\n\nA: the same behavior may also occur it seems when you would have two bluetooth mouses linked to your mac, (which could occur frequently), and both online, and close to the bluetooth antenna. \nI had no effect on left click, with right click ok, both on trackpad and bt mouth on my 2015 macBook Air. I just had to reinitialize BTooth module through debug mode, forget the second mouse on the list, and all was ok from now on. \n", "Q: How to read iPhone system logs? Does the iphone (and ipod/pad?) have an equivalent to the Windows Event Log? How can one read it?\nI'd like to examine the event log for things like unlock events (successful and failed), charging times (connect/disconnect), network access (connect/disconnect) for both wifi and data, and power cycles (on/off). Bonus points for what apps run and when. All going back several weeks (if possible).\nI want to check existing history, not install something on the device that will track this kind of information going forward.

I have two 15\" Retina MacBook Pros, a 2013 which is my work machine and a 2014 which is my personal machine. I'm trying to transfer some files between them using airdrop. Both have Yosemite on them and are on the same network. Both have been rebooted whilst on this network.\nThe 2014 MBP shows the 2013 MBP in airdrop and can drop files to it.

I've found that signing out of and back into iCloud is a temporary fix. My suspicion is that new Airdrop leans heavily on a lot more services than original Airdrop.\nAnother option is to Select 'Don't see who you're looking for' in the Airdrop windows on both machines and select 'Search for an older Mac'. This will revert to legacy mode and works as well as it did in previous versions of OS X.\nAlso check if your searching for 'Everyone' in the Airdrop window.

When I get new messages from gmail, they show up in the Unread and Today mail folders but not in the overall Inbox folder. After they are read, they disappear from Unread (of course) and are lost in the ether. If I search mail for a specific message, it finds it and indicates its either in an Important folder or simply in the inbox. Otherwise the message doesn't show up in Mail at all. \nAlso the mail remains on the gmail server when I access it directly on the web.\nI've tried to synchronize the mail accounts but nothing changes. \nI also turned on iCloud and iDrive at the same time.\n\nA: Your messages are not gone.  \nApple Mail is not displaying the Exchange or G-mail inbox properly.  \nI tested this with 2 systems: 1 on Mavericks and 1 on Yosemite.  \nThe Mavericks mail worked correctly and the Yosemite would stop displaying the inbox.  I was able to perform operations (read, flag, delete, move) messages on the Mavericks system and the actions would correctly show on the Yosemite system once I re-synced the mail application.  \nFurthermore, I only needed to click on my iCloud-based account and then go back to my Exchange account for the inbox to be displayed properly.  However, after about 30-45 seconds it would again stop displaying.\nThis looks like an Apple bug.\nI hope this helps and that Apple can fix this annoying bug soon.\n\nA: The problem lies in the Mail - List view - with Preview Window.\nUnfortunately as soon you look at the mail (without actually opening it), the Mail will mark it as viewed (since you did see it in the preview window).\nThe only way to keep email as not read till you actually click to open, is to remove the Preview window in the List view.\nTo do that just slide the dividing bar between the List view and Preview to the bottom till it disappears = no more Preview.\nThe Smart boxes you created (Unread and Today) can not keep messages as not read, as long you have the List View with Preview on. As soon as seen in Preview they will no longer be in Smart box, but should be in your Inbox and in your \"archive\" folder.

It is adequate for my needs at the moment but the OS is no longer being supported by Apple (NTP bug for example). \nThinking about the future, I am considering wiping OS X and dedicating the entire disk to Windows 7 or Linux. I've found here that Windows 7 runs well on it and Linux seemed to be ok on it when I used a recent LiveCD to test it.\nSo, my question is, are there any issues with removing OS X from the system completely? Will it break anything? Is it needed for anything?\nEDIT: Upgrade to Lion is out too, according to wikipedia support just run out - Oct '14.\nEDIT2: Apparently OS X is needed for firmware updates. But since this is a 2008 MacBook, it is extremely unlikely they will release new firmware for it.\n\nA: Do you have the original install disks for Mac OS X? If so, there shouldn't be any issues with wiping the Mac partition completely off the hdd. \nHowever, if you don't have those disks, I would strongly recommend keeping the Mac OS X install and creating a new partition (shrinking the Mac partition) for the new OS. Mainly because if something goes wrong (or if you don't like either alternative) it's much easier to recover a MacBook using the Mac OS. I think you can get away with 5-10GB for the Snow Leopard partition. \nIf you have the original install disks, you shouldn't have an issue with restoring it. \nLinux will take some tinkering to get working properly. I had a particularly rough time getting wifi to work in Ubuntu 12.blah on an older MacBook Pro. Plus side: With a laptop that old, there should be a decent amount of documentation for making your hardware work with Linux. I'd stick with Ubuntu if you like fancy, or Linux Mint if you like simple. Windows 7 (if installed through Bootcamp) works pretty well without much hassle.\n\nA: Echoing the \"backup\" to have the original disks available if you ever want to return to an old MacOSX, the only warnings I'll give is that you'll be having fun with EFI using Linux, so you might need to investigate the versions that supports that (and the UEFI support should be sufficient).\nIf you choose the Windows 7 route, the better advice will be to remove any and everything you do NOT want on the Mac side  to have the biggest space available, and then make use of the BootCamp features as that'll help you with the environment needed to boot Windows 7, as Windows 7 doesn't support UEFI/EFI \"easily\" out of the box (unless you use the 64bit version, and even there are \"gotchas\").\nYou might need to download the needed BootCamp .ISO/packages/etc. from support.apple.com's download site, as I've found them to \"not be available\" for the old MacBooks via the boot camp utility, to install all the other (after installation) drivers etc. for the Windows 7.\nI've not found the \"dual booting\" with Linux and MacOSX on a true Mac easy, but then I didn't need it so it was just a \"quick\" exercise, rather than need to have.\nAnother \"option\" for backups is to \"clone\" the MacBook's disk using CarbonCopyCloner (CCC or something) that provides you a bootable \"backup disk\"/\n\nA: Go with a Dual Boot; OS X and FreeBSD\nI personally did this on an XServe G4 (PowerPC), which was more difficult than the Intel based Macs; so your mileage will be better.  My XServe had 2 1.3GHz (RISC) CPUs, 2GB RAM and 2 80GB HDD's.  1 hard drive had 2 partitions, 1 for the OS X installer (so I didn't have to wait on the slowness of the SuperDrive) and the other partition as a TimeMachine backup of the installation.  The primary hard drive is where all the magic happened.\nI outlined this install on the Unix/Linux forum here on StackExchange \n\n\n*\n\n*I created two partitions:  a 30GB Apple partition and a 50GB Free Space partition.  The Apple partition has to be first\n\n*I installed the latest version of OS X that the server could handle (Snow Leopard) \n\n*I then installed FreeBSD onto the Free Space partition allowing the installer to \"auto partition\" it.  FreeBSD (gparted) created a /boot, /, /var, and /home.\n\n*To top it off, I installed it via USB (which said couldn't be done, but is actually pretty easy)\n\n\nSo, what I have is a FreeBSD system that I am able to boot into OS X for any \"Apple specific\" tasks like updating firmware.  I haven't had many since this install, but it's comforting to know that I have access to native OS X when I need it.\nWhy FreeBSD\nOS X is based on FreeBSD and the nice part about it is that the installer (USB img) is less than a 700MB.  Only the most essential services get installed. I have no need for a GUI so GNOME or KDE are nowhere to be found.  My server is running an AMP stack (Apache, MySQL, and PHP) so other than that, nothing else is loaded.  Security wise, it's very difficult to hack a system that doesn't have a service to exploit.\nEven nicer with FreeBSD is it's consistency.  There are too many distros in Linux and what you do in one is not the same as another (i.e. packages versus RPMs).  FreeBSD on an Xserve G4 is going to be the same as FreeBSD on a 2015 Macbook Pro.\nAs for application compatibility?  On OS X on my XServe, I couldn't upgrade PHP to 5.6 without installing Homebrew.   I am running the latest AMP stack on the XServe because it was available on their Ports Collection.\nCheck out this article from ITWire:  Running FreeBSD on the server: a sysadmin speaks\n\nA: There should be no issues with you removing OSX completely. \nThere are a few startup items you'll need to complete. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable Windows USB Drive. Use this guide.\n\n*Save all of your personal items on your Macbook to a cloud (Dropbox, etc.) or save them to an external hard drive.\n\n*Wipe the hard drive on you Mac using Disk Utilities. This is a great guide on how to do just that. You'll want to prep it such that the windows, not Mac. So don't set the format as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n\nYou'll now be able to use the bootable drive to install Windows on you old Mac machine. Good luck!\n\nA: Having run Windows7 x64 for a while now, I did come to one issue that was quite annoying but not a show stopper, and that was video performance.\nIt appears the boot camp video drivers for the Intel graphics chip are poor and as a consequence in all video playback, regardless of software used, there is minor but visible tearing. \nWhile playback on OSX is very smooth, the same software and media files in Windows7 x64 shows a small degree of tearing that for me was annoying. I was forced on more than one occasion to switch to OSX to watch it as it was bugging me.\nHere is my related Superuser question...\nhttps://superuser.com/q/1086295/300548\n\nA: Try change HDD to SSD and install OS X 10.9-10.10, would be ok and more or less compatible with current features. \nSpouse's MacBook 2009 (not Pro) works fine with 10.11 and handmade fusion drive (SSD 256 + HDD 750).\n", "Q: Virtualizing OSX currently installed As I explained here, I have an old MacBook and I am planning to replace OS X with either Windows 7 or Linux. \nI was wondering if it is at all possible to virtualize the physical Snow Leopard partition. In Windows you can convert a physical machine to a virtual machine using VMWare products.

I am searching for the iOS system-roots keychain. I found a file (certsTable.data) in /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/, it could be, but i can't open it because if i unextract it with ttdecomp i get a data file which contains only apparently random data, in the unextracted state strings find some human readable stings like \")Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority\" in the same folder there was a certsIndex.data file\n\nA: Take a look at OTATrustUtilities, which is Apple's implementation of extracting data from the system keychain. Specifically the InitializeAnchorTable function looks at extracting the data from those two files. The certsIndex.data file is a Database Index file that contains an array which can be read using NSData, this contains a list of sha1 hashes and offsets. These offsets correspond to the start of the certificate data found in the certsTable.data file, so you can start reading from the offset to the end of the certificate. It is worth noting that an application which accesses these private files will not be accepted onto the AppStore and this should only really be used for personal use or jailbreak development. \n", "Q: When setting up a new laptop, Setup Assistant doesn't see all the data I'm trying to set up a new Retina MacBook Pro, which is running OS X 10.10, by transferring data from my old MacBook, which is running OS X 10.8.6, via Thunderbolt.  My old laptop is in Target Disk Mode instead of using Migration Assistant due to the OS mismatch (the new machine wouldn't let me migrate with Migration Assistant).  As far as I can tell, this all matches what Apple says should work.  However, I have ~350 GB in my home folder, and my new laptop can only see ~50 GB.  What's going on, and is there any way to fix it?\nA few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried copying my data once already, but almost nothing got copied (I think even less than the ~50 GB).\n\n*I can't update my OS on my old laptop, because I don't have enough space.\n\n*I could try restoring from a Time Machine backup – it seems to see everything that way – but I don't have the right cables, so (until I can get those) I'm looking for a laptop-to-laptop solution over Thunderbolt.

However to install a newer version of windows that BootCamp doesn't support you need to first install a supported version then upgrade inside of windows to a newer version. My best suggestion though is to install via a virtual machine. \n\nA: I will offer the following link for to the drivers needed to install windows for your machine.\nYou will need to download the zip file found at Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 \n\nA: So it can take a bit of work but it is possible, you don't need to use bootcamp.  I followed this guide and have had Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 running from a USB3 SSD in the past.  I am going to attempt to use this guide to install Windows 10 in the coming days. \nPasted directly from link below......\nWhat you'll need\nAn external hard drive with a USB3 and/or Thunderbolt connector. This drive will be formatted so ensure you saved your files before going further. You can use either an SSD drive or a classic hard drive.\nA Windows 7 or 8 install DVD or ISO (check whether to install 32 or 64 bits versions based on your Bootcamp drivers) and the corresponding Windows serial number.\nOne of the following:\nMac OS X with a Windows 7 or 8 Virtual Machine (use VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop for example. Note: VMWare Fusion seems to have some issues with Thunderbolt and USB3. Plug your drive to a USB2 enclosure or hub to work around this -it worked for me-, or use another VM software) → Read the important note below\nA PC running Windows 7 or 8 → Read the important note below\nWindows AIK (free) running on your Virtual Machine or on your PC, or just the imagex.exe file (the rest of the Windows AIK package is not needed)\nDownload imagex.exe\nDownload Windows AIK (this download and installation is not required if you have already downloaded imagex.exe)\nBootcamp drivers for your Mac. You can get these either by running bootcamp from your Mac (Applications > Utilities > Bootcamp) or, if like me you have a 3TB drive and can't run bootcamp at all, use the direct download links here.\nA USB stick to store your bootcamp drivers\nIMPORTANT: If your Mac has a 64 bits processor, your Windows Virtual Machine on OSX, your Windows installation on your PC and your Windows DVD/ISO must also be in 64 bits!\nStep by Step guide\nStep 1: Get the install.wim file\nIf you have a Windows ISO file:\nMount the ISO\nIf you're on OS X: double click on the ISO file\nIf you're on on Windows 7: Use a software like Virtual Clone Drive (free)\nIf you're on Windows 8: double click on the ISO file\nOpen the mounted drive, then go to the \"sources\" folder and locate the \"install.wim\" file. Save this file to C:\\wim\\ on your Windows installation or virtual machine.\nIf you have a Windows DVD: open the \"sources\" folder on the DVD and locate the \"install.wim\" file. Save this file to C:\\wim\\ on your Windows installation or virtual machine.\nIMPORTANT: If instead of a \"install.wim\" file, you have \"install.esd\", you can not continue this step by step guide. And an ESD file can not be converted into a WIM file. So you must get a version of the Windows installation DVD/ISO that has an install.wim file. \nStep 2: Clean, partition and format your external hard drive\nOn your Windows installation or virtual machine, plug in your external hard drive (can be plugged using USB2, USB3 or Thunderbolt at this stage)\nOpen the command prompt in administrator mode (cmd.exe). To run it in administrator mode, right click on cmd.exe > Run as admin.\nType the following and hit enter to open the disk partitioner utility:\ndiskpart\nType the following and hit enter to list your drives:\nlist disk\nThis will display a list of disks mounted on your computer or virtual machine. Make sure your drive is listed here before you continue.\nIdentify the disk ID of your external hard drive. Replace # by your real external disk ID in the command below:\nselect disk #\nClean all partitions by typing the following (warning: this will erase all data from your external drive!):\nclean\nType the following to use MBR as partitioning format:\nconvert mbr\nCreate the boot partition by typing the following followed by the enter key:\ncreate partition primary size=350\nThis will create a 350MB partition on your external drive\nFormat the partition in FAT32 by typing the following:\nformat fs=fat32 quick\nSet this partition to active by typing:\nactive\nAssign a letter to mount this partition. We will use letter B in our example. If B is already used on your PC, replace B by any other available letter:\nassign letter=b\nWindows will detect a new drive and probably display a pop-up. Ignore that.\nCreate the Windows installation partition using all the remaining space available on the external drive by typing the following:\ncreate partition primary\nFormat the new partition in NTFS:\nformat fs=ntfs quick\nAssign a letter to mount this partition. We will use letter O in our example. If O is already used on your PC, replace O by any other available letter:\nassign letter=o\nWindows will detect a new drive and probably display a pop-up. Ignore that.\nExit the disk partitioner utility by typing:\nexit\nStep 3: Deploy the Windows installation image\nStill using the command prompt in admin mode (you didn't close it, did you? ;) ), locate the imagex.exe file mentioned in the \"What you'll need\" section and access its folder. In our example, we have put this file in C:\\imagex\\imagex.exe\nYour Windows installation ISO has probably several installation options in it. So in order to identify the right one, type in the following:\nimagex.exe /info C:\\wim\\install.wim\nNow identify the INDEX number of the installation that you wish to deploy. You will use it in the next step.\nType the following and hit enter. Replace 1 with the INDEX you identified in the previous step. Also remember to replace o: with the letter you have chosen in the previous step:\nimagex.exe /apply C:\\wim\\install.wim 1 o:\nThis will take some time. The Windows installation image is being deployed to your external drive\nOnce done, type the following to create the boot section (remember to replace o: and b: with the letters you've chosen in the previous step):\no:\\windows\\system32\\bcdboot o:\\windows /f ALL /s b:\nIf you get an error message saying that you can't run this program on your PC, then most probably you are running on a 32 bits installation of windows and you're trying to deploy a 64 bits install. This means you did not read the important notes in the beginning of this guide ;)\nIf you get an error message on the options that can be used with the BCDBOOT command, then it's because you're installing Windows 7, and the /f option is not supported. If that is the case, remove /f ALL from the command and retry.\nStep 4: Boot from your external drive and install Windows\nPlug in your external drive:\nIf you've done all the previous steps from a Windows PC, unplug your external drive from your PC and plug it to your Mac, either on a USB3 or a Thunderbolt port.\nIf you've done all the previous steps from your Mac using a Virtual Machine, ensure the external drive is plugged in to a USB3 or Thunderbolt port. Using USB2 should also work but you'll get very poor performance so I don't recommend doing that.\nReboot your Mac and once the bootup sound is over, immediately press the ALT (option) key and release it only when the boot drives selection screen appears. If you did not get the boot drives selection screen, reboot and try again. The timing to press the ALT (option) key is quite short. It must not be too early or too late.\nOn the boot selection screen, choose \"Windows\" using the arrow keys on your keyboard, then press enter.\nThe Windows installation starts. Follow the on-screen instructions as normal. The installation program will restart your computer one or 2 times. Don't forget to press ALT (option) right after the bootup sound, and boot on Windows again each time to continue the installation.\nStep 5: Install bootcamp drivers\nOnce the Windows installation is complete, plug in the USB stick where you stored the bootcamp drivers (see \"what you'll need\" section), open it and right click on \"setup.exe\" and select \"Run as admin\". Follow the on-screen instructions.\nIf you have an error saying that you can't run this program on this PC, obviously you have installed a 32 bits version of Windows and the bootcamp drivers for your Mac are made for a 64 bits version. You have to restart the whole guide and make sure to get a 64 bits version of Windows this time!\nOnce the bootcamp drivers are all installed, reboot and press ALT (option) after the bootup sound to boot on Windows again. And Voilà, you have Windows installed on your USB3/Thunderbolt drive running on your Mac.\nNow each time you want to boot on Windows, press and hold the ALT (option) key after the startup sound and select \"Windows\", then press Enter. You can now play your favortie PC games :)\nhttp://bleeptobleep.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/mac-install-windows-7-or-8-on-external.html\n", "Q: How to view certificate info without installing I have a certificate and/or private key file (pfx) on my OS X desktop.

Usually you may access NTFS only by directly attached devices (e.g. PATA, SATA, SCSI etc.)\nIf you connect to a share over the network you use a distributed file system or network file system. They do not share block level access to the same storage but use a network protocol (e.g. AFP, SMB, NFS etc.).\nSince the NTFS volume is attached to the MacMini, you won't be able to mount it via fstab or mount_ntfs on your MacBook Pro.\nInstead check the permissions / ACLs in the file sharing settings in Windows 8.\n", "Q: How do I get my system preferences to show up? \nHow do I make my system preferences show up again?

Once you download a theme, you open it and iTerm2 imports the XML and adds it to the preference file.  You then edit the preferences for the profile to use the new theme.\nEach profile contains a copy of the theme data.  It isn't just pointing to the loaded theme XML info.  This way if you edit/delete the theme, the profile continues to use the same theme colors. \nAll the profiles are stored in a single dict and one of them is set as the default.  There isn't just a 'default' profile that you could edit or update with that theme.\nIf you really want to see the huge mess that is the iTerm2 preferences, run \ndefaults read -app iterm\n\nWhat you have done so far is probably the best you are going to get.  Just keep a copy of the itermcolors theme file that you want in your dotfiles then open it to add to the iTerm2 theme list when you are setting up a new user.\nAnother option is to configure iTerm2 like you want, complete with profile themes, then back up the ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file into your dotfiles.  That one plist will contain everything you need to set up iTerm2 like you want.\n", "Q: Internal microphone does not register input in System Preferences -> Sound but registers in dictation and speech My machine is MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), OS 10.10.1 (14B25).\nI just tried to make a voice call in Google Hangouts, and Hangouts does not pick up any sound.\nI checked System Preferences -> Sound -> Internal Microphone, and the Input Level meter shows no activity - not when I talk, clap, or hit the case.\nHow do I fix this and get my internal microphone to register an input correctly?\nMore info:\nSystem Preferences -> Dictation and Speech -> Dictation has an icon that says \"Internal Microphone\" and appears to register sound.

When I use magic move with connetion lines, they disappear and reappear in the next slide.\nIt seems like magic move doesn't recognize the connection lines (or can't match them), so it just redraws them, instead of leaving them there.\nI'm trying to use magic move to make a nice presentation that includes connection lines. How can I make without the lines disappearing every time something moves?\n\nA: Turns out, according to several sources you can't do it.

I have a 2007 iMac and an Epson 730HD projector. I want to dedicate this iMac to playing media on the projector but I'm having problems with extending my display. \nI'm using a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter and connecting to the projector using an HDMI cable. The computer is detecting the projector, but the projector is saying there's no signal. I've tried playing with all of the resolution settings–thinking that maybe the projector just didn't like the resolution that the computer was sending–as I've had this problem before with other displays and setting the resolution to \"Best for display\" usually did the trick. The projector has a native resolution of 1280 x 720, I've tried every scaled resolution while extending the display and while mirroring. No luck.\nMy MiniDVI to VGA adapter works, so this appears to be only an HD problem. \nIs there anything I haven't tried? Or is my iMac just too old for this projector?\n\nScreen captures of available scaled resolution settings:\n\n\nMy Mac (24\" Intel iMac, 2007):\n\n\nA: 2007 had 2 iMac models.  The white Intel iMac and then the start of the Aluminum models.  Based on the info and pictures above, you have the Aluminum Core2Duo model, which should be able to handle up to 1920x1200 digital external display in extended desktop mode so it isn't a limitation of the iMac video RAM.\nIn the list above, when in extended desktop mode, the appropriate resolution setting for the projector would be 720p.  Have you tried configuring the iMac and projector in mirroring mode?  Check the box in the Arrangement tab on the iMac window then set the resolution to 1280x800 or 720p (which will be 1280x720 with black bars on the side of the iMac display).\nFinally if that still doesn't work, most likely it is the DVI to HDMI adapter at fault, especially if the DVI to VGA adapter is working.  Try replacing it with a new/different adapter, if possible with an Apple brand.  3rd party adapters might not be 100% compatible.\n", "Q: Too-long file name: which iOS app owns it? I have an iPhone that I back up to a Mac (via iTunes), and the backup is failing. The error shown in iTunes is useless, but the console shows this:\nJan  6 20:53:58 aron-mbp.local AppleMobileBackup[71561]: ERROR: Backup message response: 101 stat error: File name too long (63) at path \"/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/C3147DA8-A001-4A6C-BF8D-971DC2678722/Documents/iCache/pinterest.com/nevadamagazine/dataimage/pngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN....nT+soTf+\" (MBErrorDomain/101)\n(I've snipped quite a lot of characters out of the file name, as it is, in fact, extremely long.)\nSo, it looks like some app has created this huge-named file, which is stuffing up the backup process because iOS can't stat it and barfs.\nI figure, deleting the offending app should delete the file and fix the problem. But: which app is it? All I have to go on is the unique ID or whatever it's called, C3147DA8-A001-4A6C-BF8D-971DC2678722. Is there a way to determine which app this corresponds to? I'm happy to dig through the ipa files if necessary.\n(I've tried deleting the Pinterest app, given the presence of 'pinterest.com' in the path, with no luck. I've shotgunned a few others, again with no luck.)\nThis is iOS 8.1.2.\n\nA: The GUID (globally unique identifier) you see is randomly generated by iOS at the time of installation or update, and not related to the app in any way - in fact, it even changes between updates and reinstalls. Previously, apps were kept at /var/mobile/Applications/<GUID>/blah.app with Documents, Library and tmp alongside it in its sandbox, however now in iOS 8 that's changed so /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/<GUID>/blah.app contains the app and /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<some other GUID> contains the data. Unfortunately, the data and bundle GUIDs don't match, so that's made it a lot harder to track down.\nOn a jailbroken device, you could use the iFile app from Cydia to navigate through the file system to the offending file and delete it. I would recommend you also check the Library/Preferences folder so you can see the bundle identifier of the app, which should help you determine the offending app, so you can report this issue to the developer. It's worth noting that the developer is using the Documents folder to store caches, which is meant for, well, documents. They should be using Library/Caches, which isn't backed up by iTunes.\nYou could alternatively use iCleaner Pro (I haven't used it before so I can't give you specific instructions).\nAnother method if you don't have a/don't want to jailbreak would be to download iFunBox (note for Windows users: download the classic version) and look through the application list manually until you happen to find Documents/iCache/.... Right click the offending file and choose Delete.\nA last-ditch method is to fill up your disk with data, which triggers iOS to start clearing app caches to make some room.\n", "Q: Create Custom Drop Down Menus in the Finder Toolbar Any Dropbox users out there will recognize the drop down menu that one can add to their Finder toolbar.\n\nUpon discovering that this existed, I immediately wondered if/how I could create my own sort of drop down menu (just as Dropbox did; Finder comes with plenty of native ones as it is). You'll notice a variety of icons beside the Get Info button; these are applications. Given how much clutter they create for me (it gets somewhat annoying to have to expand the Finder window every time I create one), it would be really convenient to be able to create my own drop down menu button, which would contain any applications or files I want to store in my toolbar.\nI currently don't know how to code for Mac, so any extremely involved solutions would be a bit difficult. I can work with Applescript and C#, though. Essentially what I'm looking for is an application that allows one to create these drop down menus, or some other (fairly simple) way to create plugins for Finder.\nSome quick tech specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite 10.10.1\n\n\nSide note:\nThis might be something of interest as far as my question goes. I'm not necessarily looking to create a button (although a drop down menu is technically activated by a button), but I think this explains fairly nicely how I'd like to go about creating the drop down menu.\n\nA: That button is added to Finder using the FinderSync Extension APIs:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Finder.html\n\nFinder Sync supports apps that synchronize the contents of a local folder with a remote data source. It improves user experience by providing immediate visual feedback directly in the Finder. Badges display the sync state of each item, and contextual menus let users manage folder contents. Custom toolbar buttons can invoke global actions, such as opening a monitored folder or forcing a sync operation.\n\n\n", "Q: How to find and remove duplicate calendar entries (Mac OS, Yosemite) I'm using the Calendar application on Mac OS X 10.10.1 \"Yosemite\". The calendar is laden with many years of history, and I've just imported some data from a phone as well. It turns out that some of the phone entries were new, but some were duplicates of entries already in Calendar.\nNote that \"duplicate\" has some complicated cases. For instance, there are weekly repeating events where the phone's data correcting deleted some instances of the meeting (we didn't meet over the New Year holiday), while the original Calendar data incorrectly shows those instances occurring. Such pairs are \"duplicate\", even though they aren't identical.\nHow can I automate the process of identifying which calendar entries are duplicates, choose which one to keep, and delete the other?

I have just purchased a WD My Passport Pro. It comes in a striped RAID 0 configuration comprising of two 2TB drives.\nI want to partition the drive into 3:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photoshop Cache\n\n*Lightroom Catalogue\n\n*Video files\n\n\nI am not worried about backup as I am backing up regularly from this RAID.\nWhen I look at the drive in Disk Utility there is no tab for partitioning, so I am unable to create there partitions. How can I do so?\n\nA: Things to check for. Some Raid devices are set/Fixed for only one type of Raid 0 or 1. You should check the box and see if this can be used for anything other than Raid 1. Also there maybe software from WD on the drive that will change the Raid for you. If the WD is not hardware locked to be only a Raid 1 and you are unable to find WD software you can try the steps below. \nIf you can not erase the WD with Disk Utility then try looking over instructions to erase it from the command line on this site. \nhttp://www.theinstructional.com/guides/disk-management-from-the-command-line-part-1\nWe will do this in three steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Erase\n\n*Create the Raid\n\n*Partition the Raid\n\n\nThe hard drives you will be using as members of the RAID 0 striped set must first be erased. And since a RAID 0 set can be severely impacted by a drive failure, we’re going to take a little extra time and use one of Disk Utility’s security options, Zero Out Data, when we erase each hard drive.\nWhen you zero out data, you force the hard drive to check for bad data blocks during the erasure process, and mark any bad blocks as not to be used. This decreases the likelihood of losing data due to a failing block on the hard drive. It also significantly increases the amount of time it takes to erase the drives from a few minutes to an hour or more per drive.\nErase the Drives Using the Zero Out Data Option\nMake sure the hard drives you intend to use are connected to your Mac and powered up.\nLaunch Disk Utility, located at /Applications/Utilities/.\nSelect one of the hard drives you will be using in your RAID 0 striped set from the list on the left. Be sure to select the drive, not the volume name that appears indented under the drive’s name.\nClick the ‘Erase’ tab.\nFrom the Volume Format dropdown menu, select ‘Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)’ as the format to use.\nEnter a name for the volume; I’m using StripeSlice1 for this example.\nClick the ‘Security Options’ button.\nSelect the ‘Zero Out Data’ security option, and then click OK.\nClick the ‘Erase’ button.\nRepeat steps 3-9 for each additional hard drive that will be part of the RAID 0 striped set. Be sure to give each hard drive a unique name.\nNow that we have erased the drives we will use for the RAID 0 striped set, we’re ready to start building the striped set.\nCreate the RAID 0 Striped Set\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility, located at /Applications/Utilities/, if the application is not already open.\n\n*Select one of the hard drives you will be using in the RAID 0 striped set from the Drive/Volume list in the left pane of the Disk Utility window.\n\n*Click the ‘RAID’ tab.\n\n*Enter a name for the RAID 0 striped set. This is the name that will display on the desktop. Since I will be using my RAID 0 striped set for video editing, I’m calling mine VEdit, but any name will do.\n\n*Select ‘Mac OS Extended (Journaled)’ from the Volume Format dropdown menu.\n\n*Select ‘Striped RAID Set’ as the RAID type.\n\n*Click the ‘Options’ button.\n\n*Set the RAID Block Size. The block size is dependent on the type of data you will be storing on the RAID 0 striped set. For general use, I suggest 32K as the block size.

A minimum of two slices, or hard drives, is required for a striped RAID. Adding more than two will further increase performance.\nOnce you add all of the hard drives to the RAID 0 striped set, you are ready to create the finished RAID volume for your Mac to use.\n\n*Click the ‘Create’ button.\n\n*A ‘Creating RAID’ warning sheet will drop down, reminding you that all data on the drives that make up the RAID array will be erased. Click ‘Create’ to continue.\nDuring the creation of the RAID 0 striped set, Disk Utility will rename the individual volumes that make up the RAID set to RAID Slice; it will then create the actual RAID 0 striped set and mount it as a normal hard drive volume on your Mac’s desktop.\nThe total capacity of the RAID 0 striped set you create will be equal to the combined total space offered by all members of the set, minus some overhead for the RAID boot files and data structure.\nYou can now close Disk Utility and use your RAID 0 striped set as if it were any other disk volume on your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Can't tell if apache is running on Mavericks Why can't I see httpd in activity monitor nor top in Mavericks?\n\nA: *\n\n*Activity Monitor default view of the process list is 'My Processes':\n\n\n\n\n*Switch to 'All Processes' in the menubar to additionally see other users' - like root or _www - processes:\n\n\n\n*Check again in 'Activity Monitor'\n\n\n\n*If it's still not visible it's not running.\n\n\n*httpd not running is default for Mavericks client and server.\n\nA: You could also open a terminal window and type the following:\nps aux | grep \"httpd\"\n", "Q: not using free data allowance I have a 5Gig data allowance on my phone and I hardly ever use more than a fraction of it.

Some apps don't have this delay (for example Sublime Text 2/3 where you can drag the text immediately after selecting it) but in most apps you would have to click the left mouse button and hold it for a bit before you can drag the selected text.\n\nA: I think the default is 1 second, which is far too long for me. I find 100ms better.\ndefaults write -g NSDragAndDropTextDelay -int 100\nshould work just fine. \nApps need to be relaunched after changing that value.  \nSetting a negative number will disable drag altogether; zero sets it to immediate.\n\nA: With Tinkertool this can be done…\n\nTinkerTool is an application that gives you access to additional preference settings Apple has built into OS X. This allows to activate hidden features in the operating system and in some of the applications delivered with the system.\nTo further guarantee that the tool cannot change any part of your installation, but only gets access to your personal preference settings, the program puts itself under the restrictions of Apple's Application Sandbox. TinkerTool is the first application of its kind to use this innovative technology.\nWhen you have defined your preferred set of “pro” preference settings, you can additionally export and import the settings, copying them to another user account or to a different computer. All settings which don't depend on the availability of third-party applications can be transferred.\nBecause TinkerTool only gives you access to features already built into OS X, its feature set varies greatly between different operating system versions.\n\n", "Q: Disk Capacity 500 gb falls to 250 gb after deleting files I was attempting to free up disk space on my MB Pro - and subsequently deleted most of the iPhoto files & folders as I was constantly receing a 'your start up disk is almost full (e.g. 2.5 gb left out of 499 gb available.    \nSo, having done that, my Hard Drive capacity is now showing only a 250 gb capacity - despite there apparently being a Hard Drive & a SSD each with 250gb.  \nHow can I restore it to its full capacity?\nMacintosh HD:\n\n  Available:    195.88 GB (195,884,195,840 bytes)\n  Capacity: 250.14 GB (250,140,434,432 bytes)\n  Mount Point:  /\n  File System:  Journaled HFS+\n  Writable: Yes\n  Ignore Ownership: No\n  BSD Name: disk0s2\n  Volume UUID:  1455A0BF-327D-3453-B82F-C2504F6EF7CC\n  Physical Drive:\n  Media Name:   APPLE SSD SD0256F Media\n  Medium Type:  SSD\n  Protocol: PCI\n  Internal: Yes\n  Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n  S.M.A.R.T.

I want to buy a \"new\" MacBook to replace my white MacBook 13\" (Mid 2007), which makes me mad especially because of its limited RAM (only 3 GB possible).\nI want to buy a MacBook Pro 13\" and I'm not sure if it is worth taking a really new model (13\" or 13\" retina) or maybe buying a used one which might be much cheaper.\nI saw a MacBook MC700LL/A MacBook Pro 13\" Early 2011\" 2.3 GHz (8 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD built-in later) and I wonder how much it is different from the current \"normal\" 13\" MacBook Pro which seems to be nearly unchanged since 2012.\nMy question\nI can compare the technical specs, but I am not sure \n\n\n*\n\n*how much difference they will make in my daily life and especially if I could maybe regret to buy a MacBook with an older USB/Airport/Bluetooth standard...\n\n*if there are other differences / disadvantages of the older model\n\n*How much \"better\" the smallest current MacBook Pro 13\" Retina model would be compared to the 2 of them - which use cases would justify buying this one?\n\n\nUse case\nI'm currently using my MacBook mainly for\n\n\n*\n\n*E-Mail and Web-Browsing (the latter makes my old MacBook nearly unusable, as Safari with some open Tabs regularly blocks all my RAM after a short while and I have to close it)\n\n*Office Applications and LaTeX\n\n*working with large databases (file size many GB)\n\n\nIn the future, I'd also like to do (private) graphics and video editing and \"multimedia stuff\".\nDifferences from my point of view between used MacBook Pro Early 2011 and current MBP 13\" 2012:\n\n\n*\n\n*new MacBook is really new, has warranty and a new battery\n(the used one is already nearly 4 years old)\n\n*the technical specs (see screenshot below) seem to be very similar to each other, differences are mainly CPU speed, USB and Bluetooth standards\nsource: http://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-comparison-chart/?compare=all-intel-macs&highlight=0&prod1=MacBookPro043&prod2=MacBookPro057\nrows with differences in specs are highlighted in blue!\n\n\nComparison between all 3 models:\nsource: http://www.everymac.com/ultimate-mac-comparison-chart/?compare=all-intel-macs&highlight=0&prod1=MacBookPro043&prod2=MacBookPro057&prod3=MacBookPro080\n\n\n\nA: In my opinion, I'd get the newest Mac, especially if you get a warranty with it. The newer the computer, the more OS X updates it can handle. As far as graphics go, I'd go with the one that has better specs. If you do end up buying a new one, upgrade the RAM, and if you plan on working with video editing software, definitely get the i7 processor instead of an i5. I currently use a Mid 2012 MBP (Non retina) and it functions pretty well, however, there are times when rendering videos gives me the \"Spinning Wheel of Death\". The new one is going to be better, even if it's a little more. And as far as your statement about the \"Macbook Pro hasn't changed much since 2012\", the new ones are lighter but don't include disc slots, so keep that in mind. The new MBP is definitely an improvement, and although the looks haven't changed much, it'll (most likely) run smoother and gain more support for future updates.\nEDIT\nIf you can (I haven't bough a new Mac in a while so I'm not sure you can do this with laptops), upgrade your graphics card to the Nvida (whatever model they have).

How can I learn a service-target of a service from it's service-name?\n\nA: A service target is a service name plus a target domain, which describes the context in which the service runs, e.g. whether it runs at system startup or when a particular user logs in etc.\nThe launchctl(1) manpage describes 6 ways of forming a service target from a service name. If you want to disable a service that runs at startup, you probably want one of these three depending on whether it's a service that runs at system startup or when you log in:\nsystem/[service-name]\n    Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain. The system\n    domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is considered a privileged execu-\n    tion context.

Here's the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I just finished burning a CD using the standard feature through Finder, I could hear the \"done\" sound.\n\n*At that time, I had a different application focussed (e.g. Chrome).\n\n*An alert-like dialog window must have popped up somewhere (e.g. to tell me it's done or something), but I can't find it.\n\n*I now can't focus my already opened Finder window, or even my desktop!

They have 6+ Mac Minis, an iMac, a MacBook, a MacBook Pro and a Mac server (not a Mac Pro, a silver desktop box).\nI'm presented with the need to take backups of hard drive content, and then re-image them with 10.8, reinstalling Microsoft Office 2011.\nWith 10+ computers, downloading the OEM OS version 10+ times via Recovery, and then updating seems slow and pointless.\nHow can I re-image all these Macs in a sane way? Coming from a Linux background, this all seems overly complicated.\nBonus points if someone can point me to some free software that will help me administer all of these. I watched Google's talk on the matter, but there didn't seem to be anything out of the box.\n\nA: Nice thing about the Mac OS is it can be cloned, even while it is running. \nWhat you want to do is create a bootable disk exactly as you want everything to be. Install applications as desired, create one user (admin) that you will use for maintenance. If you are using Open Directory it's a bit more involved but not much.\nWith only a dozen or so machines you can do them manually in under a day.\nThe process I would use is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the working image on what will be your computer. Use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy it, file mode, to external drive A. Partition drive A to be only a hundred megabytes or so larger than the data (important for next step)\n\n*Attach the hardware to your desktop in target disk mode (hold T on startup - it now behaves like an external firewire case. Yes, you need a firewire cable. No, doesn't work with USB.)\n\n*Copy (finder drag works fine) computer -> Users -> theirName to Large External Drive B\n\n*Go back to Carbon Copy Cloner. Source disk: Drive A. Destination: other computer in target mode. Copy type: Block (you may need to enable this mode in preferences. Wait. Repeat from step 2 as needed.\nThe first clone-to-external in file mode means that everything is linearized and doesn't include things like /tmp/ and /swap/. The second clone in block mode is  lot faster and doesn't have the write-amplification issues if the destination is an SSD.\n\nA: If the silver desktop runs any recent version of Mac OS Server, you can set up a \"Net Install\" service which can install an image of a single computer onto any computer on the same network (it completely erases the other computer).  To create the Net Install image, you need two computers running the OSX version you want to clone:  The clone-source, and another Mac which will run the image creation utility.\nFor 10 computers, the payoff for setting this up might not be worth it -- especially, if you have to backup important data from each of the other computers before you install the new image.  But, it is an option.  \n\nA: DeployStudio, it's free and it's built for the exact purpose you want as well as being highly configurable, and it's tried and tested. We use it here at school for deploying hard disk images to 200+ iMacs and MacBooks. The fact that such a powerful tool is free should put it at the top of your list of options. \nYou will need a machine running OS X server for the other Macs to NetBoot from but it's not expensive and once it's up and running you won't look back. The caching server service on OS X server is another good reason for going down this route as it will save your organisation's bandwidth by caching Apple updates and software from the App Store.\n\nA: Faced with administering those machines, I would look at Apple Remote Desktop (ARD). ARD allows system imaging, software deployment and host of other features. Not free, but the $80 it costs will recoup itself in the time you'll save trying to manage what you need to accomplish.\n", "Q: How do I get old photos back in iOS 8 message Since updating to iOS 8.1.2 I can't see old photos on messages just new photos\n\nA: Not sure what your question is exactly, so I'm not sure I'm answering your problem.\nMake sure that in Settings → Messages then scroll all the way down and Check the Message History preferences, the Audio Messages and Video Messages preferences, and after how long they're set to expire.\nIf you want to restore something into your messages, maybe try to Restore from an iCloud or a local iTunes backup if you have one.\n", "Q: Transfer software license/registration keys to a new Mac Where does OS X store license/registration keys for apps?

I am experiencing several problems with my MacBook Pro early 2011.\nIt all started about two months ago with my wifi card. It lost connection to the network every few hours. The symbol in the status bar of MacOS X kept showing that I am connected, but there was no network connection. When I tried to disable and enable again I could not enable it anymore until I rebooted. This behaviour occurred in the beginning approximately every two or three hours and in the end it happened minutes after rebooting. Now MacOS shows most of the time, but not always, a wifi symbol with a white x in the middle.\nAbout three weeks ago, it started that I could not send my MacBook to sleep anymore. In the beginning I investigated the problem only a little bit, tried to create a new user account and see if this user could send it to sleep, but that did not work. Three days ago, I read more about this problem and Apple says you should try booting safe mode and see if it can go to sleep in this mode. I tried it, it did not work and when I tried to boot back to normal mode I got a “prohibited sign” after I saw the Apple Logo while booting.\nI tried to reinstall Mac OS X on the partition on which it was already installed to keep my personal files, but the installation got stuck and failed. I made a backup of my files and did a fresh installation which also failed when I did it using the recovery partition. I tried it again from a USB drive installer and it worked. \nAfter that I used the Apple Hardware Test and the quick test found a memory error: 4MEM/9/40000000: 0x83b52598 I upgraded the RAM on my own years ago with two 4GB chips. After the test I replaced one of the chips with one of the built-in 2GB chips and neither the quick nor the extended test failed. After one day of working with my MacBook I did again three more extended tests, out of curiosity. The first one of these failed with an 4MEM/62/40000000 0x838da618 the other two, I did them several hours later, succeeded without errors.\nDuring the backup process (before replacing the ram) I booted Ubuntu from a USB drive and two out of five or six boots stopped with a couple of errors, I will attach a screenshot of these errors. \n\nAre these errors also RAM related or might it also be a broken processor? \nWhat can break a memory chip? Is it normal that this happens from time to time? \nThanks for your help.\n\nA: While hard drives are the most likely component to die in any computer, memory can and does fail from time to time. An \"Early-2011\" model will be nearly four years old now so it's worth considering an HDD replacement at some point (these were some of the first systems to feature SATA-III controllers so you will be able to take full advantage of current SSD speeds).\nHowever, if AHT is detecting memory issues then that's the area to focus on. Booting from USB is obviously independent of any potential hard disk issues and boot failures are nearly always guaranteed to be down to memory issues.\n", "Q: How to restore access to a disabled iCloud data?

I found a way to do so, but firstly i need to shrink my other partition - Macintosh HD, why am I unable to do so? Thanks \n\nA: Well, I have another solution; hope it would work fine. Backup Windows data (bootcamp) firstly. Use Bootcamp utility to delete the existing Windows partition. Once you delete it, recreate new Windows partition with Bootcamp a little larger as you desire. Then reinstall Windows.\n\nA: Most obvious reason is your primary partition is full. Can't shrink a partition to smaller than it's contents, and you will need some extra space for rearrangement.\nEmpty the trash (Finder, Mail, iPhoto etc), delete apps you don't need, delete downloads you no longer need etc.\nYou may still have problems resizing the partition as a full partition leaves things in odd places. Free space and useful space are not always the same thing.\nBest way is get a large external drive (cheap these days), copy your internal drive to it, erase the internal, partition it as you wish, copy back. In some cases this process is faster than resizing a partition as files have to be copied only twice, not moved around like Tetris blocks.\n\nA: I was able to solve this by turning off filevault.  Then, letting osx decrypt the hard drive.  After a reboot, I was able to resize my partition.\n", "Q: How to set proxy configuration file in command line?

So that I can create an alias in my zshrc file.\n\nA: networksetup is a configuration tool for network settings in System Preferences. I don't really known what the ShadowsocksX project is,\nbut this command can help you up.\nFor instance, for a certain .pac config file, you could do:\nnetworksetup -setautoproxyurl \"Wi-Fi\" \"http://somedomain.com/proxy.pac\"\n\nPS: if you just need to set the proxy for something like wget, or curl, then you can use the fairly universal http_proxy and ftp_proxy ENV variables (e.g., export http_proxy=http://myproxy:port).\n", "Q: Sharing Mac mini with monitor in another room. (also bluetooth keyboard/mouse with second monitor) My 2012 Mac mini/thunderbolt are in one room \nI want to sit in another room and work on the Mac mini. I have a second monitor and bluetooth keyboard accessories. I do not want to set up a second computer, but I do have an iPad.\nCan I work on the Mac mini from this other location, and does the remote monitor have to be hard wired. If I had to hard wire, would setting up ethernet connection work? The benefit of the ethernet is that my house is prewired, so I would be able to work from several rooms without moving the Mac mini from its office setup.\nFor now, we would not be using the TV or a second user on the mac mini at the same time as the remote location. The remote location is mainly surfing, email, minor document projects etc. I have an iPad but also a second monitor which i'd like to put to use and it is more enjoyable and convenient w/ bluetooth keyboard/accessories at the fireplace location.\n\nA: A couple of options for you...\nYou could use an Apple TV connected to your monitor and connect to your Mini using AirPlay - since 10.9 you're no longer restricted to using AirPlay to just mirror your main display, you can use an AirPlay-connected display as a secondary display.\nOtherwise you're looking at a hard-wired display setup. Hard-wiring may be cheaper, it all depends on the length of cable-runs as you may need to look at active video signal boosters/extenders for longer runs. If your existing Ethernet cabling is point-to-point and you've a cable that runs from your main room to your secondary, you could use DVI-Ethernet extenders. These use the cabling to transmit video directly rather than actually being connected to the home network.\n", "Q: Entire folder missing from home screen A baby, playing with my iphone 5, made a folder disappear.  I don't know if she deleted it or not but if I spotlight one of the apps, it is still on the phone and shows the old folder name.  However, none of the apps that were/are in that folder have icons on the screen and I have to spotlight each of them to start it.  Any ideas for restoring the folder or the individual icons so I can make the folder again?\n\nA: I had the same issue, and finally figured out a way to fix it!\nThere are 2 ways to fix this issue, either via iTunes or on the iPhone.  The iTunes route is quicker and if you have a lot of apps in that missing folder you might not remember all of them and iTunes gives you the full list.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes with your iPhone plugged in and click on your phone.\n\n*Go to the apps tab\n\n*locate all the apps that where in that folder and remove them. \nI actually removed all the apps except 2 that I didn't want to remove just yet because they had data on them that I didn't want to lose. Interestingly enough after removing all the other apps the 2 apps I didn't remove resurfaced on my phone without the folder.  So quite possibly maybe just try to remove 1 or 2 apps from that folder only and see if the other resurface, which makes this process all that quicker and better.\n\n*Now reinstall all the apps you removed and they should all reappear back on your phone with out the folder.\n\n*Make a new folder and put all the apps back in.  \nVoilà, there you have it!\n\nA: It is easy to get back all your missing applications.\nGo to Settings > General > Reset > Reset all settings.\nLet the phone Reset all.\nYou will not lose your data. All you need to re-enter Wifi codes.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Go to a random folder. Pull out all the apps. It should resurface. \nAlternatively, move all folders to a new screen and then pull the apps out of one. \nGood luck. \n\nA: All this answers are terribly overcomplicated.\nI had this problems several times (with apps and folders disappearing) and solved it by simply restarting my iPhone.\n", "Q: Centrify Advantages Before I spend a lot of money. What are the main benefits of using Centrify over the Mac's built in ability to bind to Active Directory?\nAfter many years of using the \"magic triangle\" and defining what can be done and cannot. I cannot see what the big difference is with Centrify. Is it more geared towards large schemas?\nPlease can someone shed some light?\n\nA: There are a few major differences worth highlighting:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple solution is probably ok for a small environment but does not scale well in larger more complex environments (e.g. Apple does not support multi-domain trusts).\n\n*The Apple AD plugin is more complicated to setup and definitely has some limitations. For example, see this article here which talks about some of the challenges with deploying the Apple solution.\n\n*The Centrify solution includes tools for doing mass deployment and management which will help with larger installations.\n\n*Of course, Centrify supports policy management via Group Policy if that is something that you care about. Handy for things like pushing out role-based rules for both Macs and Mac users.\n\n*Plus Centrify supports Smart Card-based login and has new cloud-based technology for extending AD-based management to mobile Macs and other devices.

Later, I notice that the battery is charged at 100 %.\nNow, what is better to preserve the battery capacity ?\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplugging the cable. \n\n*Leaving the cable plugged. \n\n\nThe answer may vary depending on whether I leave the iPad sleeping or whether I use the iPad.\n \n\nA: It doesn't really matter. You're already using up some capacity when you charge past 50%.\nFor long term storage, Apple recommends that you only charge the device up to 50% and then power it off. Basically if you are concerned about the longest capacity of your battery, you wouldn't consume it at all and you'd just charge it to 50% and then put it in a box for 6 months as it slowly self-discharges. You would then power it on and charge it back to 50% and put it back in the drawer off.\nRealistically, just use the iPad and follow the instructions Apple gives to the letter. As long as you disconnect it from charge and regularly deplete the battery you won't have meaningful problems with excess wearing. As long as you're not in a long term storage situation, disconnect the cord when it's convenient to you.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n\nA: I have asked Apple.

Which is the maximal refreshment rate for two connected Thunderbolt Displays? I want to connect them via Mini-Display-Port to the Thunderbolt Ports of my MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2014. I want to use the maximum resolution (2560 px) on both TB Displays. Is it possible to run them both at 60 Hz and max. resolution?\n\nA: According to Everymac\n\nThis model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\n\n…so I'd say 'yes'.\n\nA: I am trying to run 4 monitors to my MBP Mid 2014.\nIs the answer to this question accurate?

Or if not, is there a \"after-market\" search app that is good. I have to be able to look up files.\n\nA: OS X treats folders that start with a \".\" as hidden, and Spotlight doesn't search them.\nYou could use find in the Terminal.app to find files.

If I activate another app it fails at about 10gb with error \"the operation can't be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8084)\". If I switch between apps often enough it also succeed. I tried it with 2 different external usb3 drives. It looks like mavericks decides to lower priority or freeze inactive copy process which causes copy error. The error tends to appear only when copy dialog is not visible (fully obscured by another window, minimized, another fullscreen app is active). How to fix this?\n\nA: I think your hunch is correct. You seem to have run into a problem with App Nap. To save energy, a background task with no visible UI gets throttled down and eventually stopped. Each time you bring the dialog to the front, it has a \"visible UI\" and gets a new lease on life.\nDepending on which app is doing the copying, you might be able to disable App Nap for that application. Get Info on the app, and put a checkmark in front of \"Disable App Nap\". You can't do that with Finder, though, because Finder's Get Info window doesn't show that checkbox.\nYou might try disabling App Nap system-wide. To do that, go to Terminal and enter the command:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES\n\nWell, not quite system-wide. Only within your account. Repeat while logged in as each user that you want App Nap disabled for.\nBear in mind that disabling App Nap may make your computer consume more energy. If it's a portable, that means shorter battery life. But no worse than the way things were before the App Nap feature was introduced in Mavericks.\n", "Q: Using SSHFS with launchd I have a Raspberry Pi I want to automount on my Desktop (Yosemite 10.10.1).

I previously asked this question for iOS 7.  I am on iOS 8 now and in the Settings for Touch ID, there is a specific toggle for Use Touch ID for iTunes & App Store. \nI turn it on - it tells me that I need to create a passcode (in case Touch ID isn't available).  After that, it makes me enter the passcode to unlock the phone.\nIs there a way to use Touch ID exclusively for the iTunes and App Store and also not having a passcode on the device?\n\n\nA: Sorry for my image being Dutch, but you can disable the unlock functionality easily after setting it up correctly.\n\nNo, you need to have a password in case Touch ID doesn't work. There's no way (at least without jailbreak) to get this 'fixed'.\n\nA: After each time you reboot the phone, it will demand the unlock code. Only once that has been successfully entered will it then allow TouchID.\nSame applies to initial login & also iTunes.\nHaving TouchID enabled makes it always lock when switched off, there is no grace period for switching it back on within the 'lock after…' period, like devices without TouchID.\n", "Q: Swap iCloud account registered to an iPhone? I bought my son a new iPhone at Christmas so I now have his old one but it has his iCloud account on it. \nIf I delete the account on this phone can I make a new one for me and will his account still be active and ok on his new device?\n\nA: Why not set up the new phone first. Once that's done and your son has verified all the games and apps and settings are correct. Erase all content and settings on the old phone (under general in the settings app - go to the bottom where it says reset).\nThat way, you can set up the \"old\" phone with only the accounts you care about.\n\nA: Before you do anything to the old phone, have him set up his new one and log into his iCloud account on it.\nTo answer your question, yes. When you remove his iCloud account from his old iPhone, everything will still be on his new phone. When you remove his iCloud account, you are not \"deleting\" the account itself, just the copies of his content (apps, games, music, movies, books, and so on) stored locally on his old iPhone.\nIf you have a Mac, I would suggest that you have him log into his account, plug his old iPhone into the Mac and make a backup of it in iTunes, then plug in his new iPhone and restore the backup of his old phone to his new phone.\nMost apps these days have accounts or syncs of their own, so you shouldn't have to worry about them. Still, if what I suggested in the last paragraph doesn't work, just have him give his old phone one final sweep to make sure he didn't forget anything important.\nOnce he has everything he wants off of his old phone, just go to Settings >> General >> Reset >> Erase All Content and Settings, then hit \"Erase iPhone\" when prompted. Do that, and all of his data will be removed from his old phone and you can do with it what you will, without his new phone being affected at all.\nMore information on factory resetting an iPhone and also on backing up and restoring can be found here: http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-factory-reset-an-iphone/\n", "Q: How can I copy my music from iPod Nano (model A1446) to iPhone 5s? I am trying to somehow extract the music from my iPod and also transfer all the playlists the way I arranged them on the iPod before. The iPod is a 7th generation iPod Nano and I am using iTunes 12 on Windows.\nIt appears that the only option iTunes offers me that is obvious would be to wipe my iPod and then start synchronizing data from the PC to the iPod. This appears to be due to setting it to manually manage music and videos (see below). Effectively this would remove the data from the iPod and thus not leaving anything to copy to the iPhone.\n\nNow I do know that I could transfer the files from iPod to PC in my file manager (iPod_Control). If I then import those files with their meaningless naming scheme iTunes will likely pick up all the song metadata. However, this won't aid me in any way in transferring the playlists over to the new device.\nSo how could I accomplish this without first wiping the iPod, then building an iTunes library from scratch, then transferring everything to both devices again?\n\nA: I've had a similar problem. The only solution I found was an application called TouchCopy12. It allows you to transfer songs off of an iDevice directly to iTunes. I'm pretty sure you are able to transfer playlists as well. You get (I think) 82 transfers before you have to register. The link to the program, as well as information about it, will be located down below.

I need to get a large rack mountable, 16 port or larger, cascadable, VGA KVM that works with Macs. I've tried the iogear GCS1716, which claims mac support, but refuses to display video from my xserves or minis. Support says it's because of the mini displayport to VGA adapters. I've tried Apple official ones and third party. Since no modern Macs come with VGA built-in, it seems iogear's attitude is \"Sure, Apple devices are supported. Unless you do the thing required to actually use them. Then, they are not supported.\". Natch.\nI have another KVM from another brand that escapes me at the moment that works fine, but it not cascadable, so we have out grown it.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\nEDIT - I've discovered since posting this that if the Apple machine is the only one plugged into the KVM it works fine. Go Fig.\nEDIT 2 - I've now also discovered that if nothing is plugged into port 1, then Apple machines work fine, so long as you don't switch to a PC. Then you have to reset the KVM to get the Apple machines working again.\nEDIT 3 - About a month ago this KVM full on failed, and the replacement works just fine with adapters and everything on all my machines. So it looks like it was marginal hardware all along, despite what support was telling me.\n\nA: I have a 16-port rackmount KVM from Avocent (http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Products/KVM/LCD-Console-Trays/Pages/AvocentLCDConsoleTraywithKVM.aspx) that I use with two MacMini's, linux, and windows (and previously a 2009 Xserve). It works fine with the MacMini's using the VGA to Mini-DVI, and the USBIAC KVM cable. Unsure about cascading though, quickly glanced through the specs and I didn't see it mentioned; but I'll bet there is something for it.\n", "Q: Screen Recording - NO COMPRESSION I'm looking to record my screen similar to how Quicktime does it, but I need zero-compression, since I need the pixel colors to remain correct.\nBasically, I need a automated series of screenshots, if that's possible - lossless PNG at half-second intervals.\nAre there scripts or other tools to do this?\n\nA: perhaps you'd like ScreenFlow; it offers lossless compression.\n\n", "Q: How to stream music from a Mac to an iOS device?

I just installed MacTeX onto Yosemite and it installed everything in usr/local/texlive\nHowever if I am in Terminal and try to compile a LaTeX file with pdflatex foo.tex, it cannot find the LaTeX tools. Further whereis pdflatex returns no results.\nIf I specify the entire path of pdflatex (e.g., /usr/local/texlive/2014/.../bin/pdflatex) it all works well.\nHow can I get the LaTeX tools to work from the terminal without specifying the entire path?\n\nA: To get the LaTeX tools to run from the command line, you need to add the path to your pdflatex to your executable search path. To do this, you'll need to edit the .bash_profile file in your home directory. Open the file in a plain text editor (e.g. vi, emacs, bbedit) and add this line at the bottom:\nPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2014/.../bin:$PATH\n\nwhere /usr/local/texlive/2014/.../bin is the path you typed in your example to get pdflatex to run.\n\nAn aside\nwhereis only returns results from system-installed executables. which looks in the entire path. e.g. on my machine:\n~ 503   whereis ruby\n/usr/bin/ruby\n~ 504   which ruby\n/Users/steve/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/ruby\n\n\nA: For binaries to be accessible from the command line, their locations must be part of the PATH environment variable. If you do the following\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2014/.../bin\n\n(filling in the correct path), you will be able to call pdflatex directly (as well as every other program in the same directory. To make the change permanent, export the command in a file sourced by the shell, such as .bash_login or .profile (assuming you use bash).\nEither use an editor or run \necho \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2014/.../bin\" >> ~/.bash_login\n\nWhich will append the output of the echo command to the file and create it if it does not exist.\nThe shell searches the directories in the PATH in the order they are listed, so usually it is a good idea to always append to the PATH unless you know exactly what is in the added directory. It might contain other executables with the same name as other programs which are already in the PATH. Having these shadowed can sometimes lead to surprises.\n", "Q: 2011 macbook pro not responding to startup commands My macbook doesn't respond to any commands at startup (command + s, command+r, shift, command+alt+p+r). It wants to go straight to the apple logo then to a blue or white screen. Applecare is no longer on it. What should be my next step?\n\nA: Since the shift key or option key should be recognized by the system well before the Apple logo arrives, you can conclude that you have a failed keyboard.\nPlugging in any USB keyboard and booting in safe mode (shift) or single user mode (command s) should let you know if the keyboard has issues.\nNow the Apple and blue screen are good. They mean that the core OS and hardware are fine and that the start process is hung starting your user. My guess is you need to boot to internet recovery (or an external drive) and then repair some damage to the user files or the drive itself. Then you can delete the .AppleSetupDone file and make a new admin account to see if the Mac can work.\n\nA: You have experienced a graphics card failure due to poor manufacturing.  Read it and weep:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4766577?tstart=0\nI just experienced the same problem.  You can boot in single-user mode and remove the AMD graphics card extensions, and your computer will boot with limited usability.  \nIn order to get it repaired, I recommend a 3rd party repair shop.  Applecare wouldn't have helped you much in this situation, since they will only replace one defective part with another.  Find a shop in your area with good Yelp reviews, and ask them if they do \"gpu reballing\" - do not get it reflowed, it will only break again.  Good luck to you.  Hopefully, Apple will lose this next class action lawsuit and be forced to provide compensation to affected users.  \n", "Q: Mount \"Windows\" part of hybrid ISO in OS X (10.9.5) I have an old hybrid ISO, WAR2BNE (Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition) in fact, that I am trying and failing to mount.

So instead of /dev/disk2s1s2, you just use /dev/disk2s1.\n\n*Now when you go to /Volumes/win, it should have the Windows files, not the Mac files.\n\nA: sudo mount_cd9660 -er /dev/diskx /mountpoint\n\nwhere x is the disk number and mountpoint is any directory\n", "Q: Can i create a bootable clone for my mac using diskwarrior? My mac book pro (mid 2010, running 10.10.1) is currently operating normally. I would like to clean it up and create a bootable clone to an external hard drive. Diskwarrior seems like a good cleaning/maintenance software from what I have read, I can't find a simple, clear answer if it can be used to make a bootable clone of all my software, files and operating system. Thank you for educating the newbie.\n\nA: No - that's not a function of Disk Warrior.

I have an iPhone 5 with an unlimited data plan. I usually have it at home where I only have a mediocre cell signal. I don't want to put it in airplane mode just in case I get a call or text so would turning off wifi help save battery life even when I could be on wifi? I mainly use it just for communication if that helps. Thanks\n\nA: Yes, turning off WiFi will save power.\nIn case you are not using any data it will but if you still gonna use cellular data with Wi-Fi off then it might be that you actually get less of battery life since data on cellular uses more battery than on WiFi especially if signal is weak.\nFor example for iPhone 6 (for 5 it was about the same) specs for Power and Battery are:\nInternet use: Up to 10 hours on 3G, up to 10 hours on LTE, up to 11 hours on Wi‑Fi\n\n", "Q: In Screen Sharing, how do I stop the local Mac from grabbing Mission Control keyboard shortcuts meant for the remote Mac? I have two Macs, each with ^-1 through ^-4 configured to switch between Mission Control desktops in Keyboard/Shortcuts.

However, it's a hassle to toggle these every time I start/stop using Screen Sharing. Is there a way to get the local Mac to stop grabbing the shortcuts?\n\nA: I have my local machine set to use Option for Mission Control.  I set the remote Macs to use Control.  This way, I have entirely separate key combinations.\n\nA: I use Better Touch Tool for this.

I've been using ffmpeg for the occasional video conversion for quite some time, and recently discovered that H.264 (libx264) videos generated by ffmpeg aren't working in iMovie or QuickTime (nor will they play or show a preview in Finder with the quick view feature).\nIf I generate videos using OS X applications which internally use ffmpeg (e.g. MP4tools or Adapter) the videos work fine, but not when I try to use ffmpeg directly, e.g. to convert a video:\n# ffmpeg -i input.avi output.mp4\n\nor to combine some images into a video:\n# ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type sequence image-%04d.png output.mp4\n\niMovie just imports the video as black/blank, quick preview just shows the file info, (but no video preview), and Quicktime tells me it cannot play it:\n\nWhat's going on?!\n\nA: In short, you (often) need to include the argument -pix_fmt yuv420p when using ffmpeg to generate H.264 content for Apple software/devices, and a bunch of other decoders that don't handle yuv444p.\n# ffmpeg -i input.avi -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n\nThis is not mentioned in the output when using the defaults, but can be found in their Encode/H.264 guide.\nIt turns out that ffmpeg have chosen a default pixel format of yuv444p for libx264 encoding (under some circumstances), which is not compatible with Apple's software/hardware H.264 decoders (and perhaps not very widely compatible in general?). Unfortunately this seems unlikely to change, and there's no warning about it, so just something you have to know if using ffmpeg to make H.264 files.\nAs far as I can tell, if converting a video that's already using yuv420p it'll maintain that, but if converting from something a bit more exotic (e.g. images or a GIF or whatever) the pixel format must be specified for general Apple compatibility.\n\nA: In addition to yuv420p, some discoveries on codecs in 2021 (Catalina 10.15.7 and Monterey 12.0.1, imovie 10.3 and 10.2.5, ffmpeg 4.4).\nNot all *264 codecs are the same. The -c:v libx264 codec cannot be consistently imported. Instead, use -c:v h264_videotoolbox.\nThis is true across \"Apple silicon\" (aka ARM) and Intel CPUs.\nNeither libx265 nor hevc_videotoolbox can be imported consistently, if at all.\n(edit, days later, I had a video that wouldn't import with -c:v hd264_videotoolbox. It did work with -c:v copy -c:a copy, so one more thing to try)\n", "Q: Choosing FreeBSD as Startup Disk on Intel Mac I partitioned a USB flash drive as GUID and used it to install FreeBSD 10 for x86_64 off a DVD on a MacPro1,1. I was able to select the installation DVD as my startup disk in Mac OS X just by going to System Preferences > Startup Disk and selecting it. But OS X (I tried SL, ML, and Mavericks) can't read FreeBSD startup partition on the flash drive because it's formatted as FreeBSD_UFS. As a result, I can't select the FreeBSD partition as my startup disk.\nI also tried this: sudo bless --device /dev/disk4s2 --setBoot --legacy followed by a restart (disk4s2 is the FreeBSD partition of course). It just booted back into OS X.\nI tried holding the option key at startup. The FreeBSD partition was not an option. On a PPC Mac, it is an option, but of course I need the PPC version of FreeBSD to actually boot from it. On a PC with a BIOS, I can easily set the boot device to the flash drive in the BIOS settings. Unfortunately, it's not that simple on a Mac to change EFI settings.\nI'd like a solution that doesn't involve permanent modification of the host machine. Maybe I can install a boot manager that can boot into FreeBSD that OS X will recognize as a startup disk on another partition on the flash drive. I don't know the best way to do that.\n\nA: It appears to be quite complicated to boot an OS other than Mac OS from USB. See this thread on Ask Ubuntu for discussion on someone trying to do similar. \nI know you don't want to install anything on the host system, but installing rEFInd or the older rEFIt may get you there. In that aforementioned thread a few people mentioned that once they had it installed a non-Mac OS USB drive would be listed as bootable from the bootloader menu.\n", "Q: How can I route all traffic on my iPad through a proxy?

(If I connect directly using USB, it can print fine.) The MacBook can ping the server and even open up it's CUPS web interface.\nFor my first attempt, the server was connected to the wireless network with the IP 192.168.1.139. I tried a windows laptop and it printed fine and in fact, the printer turned up as a bonjour wireless printer on my mac when I searched for network, I could connect, but couldn't print anything.

Here is my dilemma/situation: \n\n\n*\n\n*I download a PDF (or any other type) file from somewhere (i.e Safari, Email, Google Drive, etc.) into an application that can open it (i.e. Documents by Readdle)\n\n*I make some adjustments/edit the file using the app (i.e Documents by Readdle).\n\n*I go to the Email app and open an email that I want to reply to. I type up my message. \n\n*The problem: Now I want to attach that file I just edited in the app (i.e. Documents by Readdle) into this email reply that I am typing up. \nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Documents by Readdle lets you send any arbitrary file over email. Select the file in Documents, tap Actions, then Mail to. This composes a new email with the file attached.\nUpgrade to iOS 9 and you can attach arbitrary files from Apple's mail client. Documents can export files to iCloud drive for easy attachment or you can just save the file to iCloud drive from the get go and skip the Documents unless it ads value to your workflow.\n\nA: This feature is added in iOS9, although it will be up to individual apps to implement the ability to share each type of document (and some, like webarchive, are not particularly well-documented)\n\nA: You can't. Simply said. It's the developers job to incorporate core functionality like this. With an app that saves files to your device, it's only allowed to save files to the apps bundle folder on the device and no where else. So that greatly limits its functionally. Apple is slowly introducing cross-application features like sharing files etc but again it's still up to the developer to update their apps to be compatible. Readdle offers in app email using apples mail composer view controller however, if your goal is to reply to a specific email using mail and attach a file just like a desktop it's not possible at this time. Just take Apple for example, they don't have an attachment button either to support iWork's documents or their own files. A current workaround is just to just tap and hold to copy the file (if your app allows this) and paste it into mail like you have to do for pictures, other than that you will have to create a new email thread by using the in-app email feature. \n\nA: At this point of time, you could try the CloudMagic Email app. The app allows you to attach documents via the Documents app by Readdle.\n\nA: Install Google's Gmail or another email app and use it for email. Attach files easily by viewing the file share icon and add the new email app to the apps that can share files (or do this under settings separately.) Select the email app as the share tool and hit send. \nSome email apps may let you attach files like you do on your desktop with no need for using share. \n\nA: You can also use myMail app from the AppStore\n", "Q: Error 23 trying to restore original iPad from iTunes Pulled my original iPad out of my bag after returning from vacation and it had an alert on screen saying it required activation. It connected to my home wi-fi fine but failed when trying to activate. After a bunch of retries it went in to recovery mode.\nI installed latest iTunes (I'm on Windows 8.1 Pro) and started the restore process. However at the stage where it states it's verifying the restore with Apple (or something to that effect) it fails with the following message:\n\nThe iPad \"iPad\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (23).\n\nI'm stuck. Tried everything I can think of.

Here's some data about the file in question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Size: 3.5 GB\n\n*1 Video Stream: h264, 1920x1080\n\n*2 Audio Streams:\n\n*\n\n*1st: AC-3, 5.1, German\n\n*2nd: AC-3, Stereo, English\n\n\n\nI only care about the English language track, getting rid of the German 5.1 audio would be fine.\nIf possible, I would like to avoid re-encoding the video due to the amount of time it takes. Re-encoding the audio (e.g. to AAC) would be fine.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an app for the iPad that would allow me to watch the video without making any changes? Free solutions preferred.\n\n*If not, is there a process to convert the video (or the container) to a format that is natively understood by iTunes and the iPad? I know that the AC-3 audio may be a problem. Command line solutions are fine. No online conversion services, please.\n\n\nI've tried the following using ffmpeg (installed through Homebrew):\nffmpeg -i in.ts -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -strict -2 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:1 out.mp4\n\nIt converted the file, copying the video, and re-encoding the audio to AAC. The resulting file plays fine in QuickTime, but can't be imported into iTunes. I've read about the moov atom and its placement in the file, and the problems with ffmpeg to place it in the right location. Is this what I'm seeing here?\n\nA: Handbrake should do everything you need:\n\nHandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.\n\nIt will re-encode the video but it does it relatively quickly, and re-encoding audio formats/selecting audio tracks and subtitles is all possible. Great software, free too.\n\nA: After some fiddling, I've found one way to watch the video on the iPad.\nChanging the container and the audio encoding\nThis can be done in one step using ffmpeg (installed through Homebrew), loop it for all .ts files in the directory.\nThe target format is mp4, and only the second audio channel is converted to AAC. The video is simply copied without any additional re-encoding. This takes about 2 minutes per 3.5 GB file, it's pretty fast.\nfor i in *.ts ; do \n    ffmpeg -i $i -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -strict -2 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:1 $(basename -s .ts $i).mp4\ndone\n\niPad App\nThe resulting file can be previewed in QuickTime or in Finder, but it can't be imported into iTunes for some reason. I've got a question open for this here: Is there a way to show import errors in iTunes?\nI've found that the files can be played fine in a third-party app. The app is called nPlayer free: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nplayer-free-best-player-movies/id945304853?mt=8\nConfusingly enough, there's another app called nPlayer, which is not free, uses an almost identical icon, but seems to be a completely different app with a different look and feel, and from a different developer.\nAnyway, nPlayer free plays the video perfectly fine after uploading the video via iTunes File Sharing.\nConclusion\nWhile this is not exactly what I was looking for (importing the video to iTunes and watching using the iPad's native player app), it works for me. The re-encoding of the audio using ffmpeg is fast and painless, and it can be automated through a script, and transferring the file through iTunes File Sharing is not a big deal either.\nI'll still keep this question open to see whether there are any other options.\n\nA: The best video player on iOS is Infuse.\nhttp://firecore.com/infuse\nIt processes the video on the device and doesn't need any server or previous conversion. It will play your file with the least amount of effort, there is a free version but unfortunately you will need to pay for the Pro because your file contains AC3 audio.\n\nA: If it's not critically important to play it in iTunes, VLC has an iPhone/iPad app nowadays and it's been able to handle pretty much every format I've thrown at it so far.\nEDIT: Apparently VLC was removed from the app store due to some licensing disagreements, and the version that was later put back no longer supports many of the formats. Disregard this answer.\n\nA: It is not free but the plex app will allow you to do it. You will need to set up a plex server and stream. \nThe server app is free the viewer app is not. \n", "Q: How to use \"diskutil corestorage revert lvuuid\" on Yosemite if disk says it is not reversible?

How recent does the backup has to be when you're about to jailbreak an iPod Touch?\n\nA: Jailbreaking at least the older generations of iPod Touches shouldn't erase the contents.\nHowever, there's always the risk that something goes wrong in the process and you might have to restore the device - either from a previous backup or to set up as a new device with no existing data. There's no explicit requirement to take a backup before jailbreaking, the jailbreaking doesn't need one per se.\nGenerally, I'd say it's up to you how fresh you want your data to be. If you are willing to lose the data the device has accumulated after the latest backup, it doesn't matter how old the backup is.\nI recommend taking a backup right before jailbreaking.\n", "Q: How to make OS X Server 3 accessible from the internet?

My question is: In windows 8, the network icon always shows ethernet although I have selected Wi-Fi network in the settings. If my mac is connected to internet, my windows will connect normally.\nMy question is: How can I make windows 8 see list of Wi-Fi? And my windows 8 can select a Wi-Fi to connect.\n\nA: Parallels like other virtualization software for Macs uses a virtualized hardware layer. This layer doesn't have direct access to the real hardware (Type-2 Hypervisor). This includes the Wi-Fi-interface.\n\nInstead software ethernet bridges are used to access the hardware indirectly. That's the reason for the network interfaces of the Mac (e.g. en0: ethernet, en1: wifi) showing up as ethernet interfaces in the virtual machines.\nConsequently Windows 8 or any other OS running in a VM on a Mac can't show and access any Mac internal Wi-Fi in their network settings.\nThere might be one exception:\nUSB-Wi-Fi sticks directly attached to the virtual machine. I can't verify that since i don't have such a stick.

Is it a technical problem or just a business decision from Apple to not to enable that in the SDK?\nCan anyone explain it to me please?\nThanks!\n\nA: HTML5 and Flash are not the same thing.\nFlash is a proprietary browser plugin. Flash is not available on iOS devices, full stop, and support outside of iOS devices is spotty at best.\nHTML5 audio playback is supported by mobile Safari as of v6.0 (which corresponds to iOS 6 that came out in 2012) according to this page, as well as Google Chrome which runs on Android devices. Between those two, you are covering 95+% of the market for mobile devices.\nPresuming you are targeting mobile devices, HTML5 audio would be the best solution. If you are also targeting desktops, HTML5 with a Flash Player fallback would probably be worthwhile.\n", "Q: PBS not working on Apple TV. Other channels are fine I have I believe is a second generation AppleTV. A few weeks ago, I could no longer stream PBS content. I can get all other channels without any issues. \nI can get into the PBS app itself. I can see the content. I can go into settings. If I select something to watch, I sometimes even see the commercial supported by content that plays at the beginning of some of the streams. However, I then see the little spinner, and the screen goes blank. If I press the Apple TV Remote, I can see the frame which shows where I am in the show, and it even shows me the length of the show, but nothing plays.\nI've rebooted the Apple TV by unplugging it and plugging it back in. I've switched PBS affiliates. I haven't tried completely resetting my Apple TV because that means reentering and enabling every other channel. I'm hoping to do that as a last resort.\nI've seen hints on other forums that the most recent Apple TV update of PBS broke the service, but nothing solid, and nothing about what can be done to fix the issue.\nAnyone else have or had these issues? Was anyone else able to work around them? \n\nA: I have similar issues.  All works fine on the Apple TV with the exception of streaming the PBS shows.  PBS works fine on my PC.  I'm using an Apple TV2 and have a Passport subscription to PBS. We just finished watching Victoria and other Masterpiece series a while back but now, after the commercials play, I get 'Error loading Content' or Content not available now, try again later'.\nYou and I will need to work with PBS support to fix out accounts in all likelihood. \n\nA: The PBS Kids app on Apple TV is the only app I've used that consistently has problems (I'm guessing it shares a codebase with the PBS App, so problems are similar). Sometimes it locks up in the middle of an episode (this is somewhat rare, thankfully), but more commonly:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 'live' feed that starts playing as you open the app keeps playing in the background after you choose a show/episode to watch, so you have two audio streams playing at the same time. The only way to fix is to quit the app (press home button on ATV remote twice, then swipe up), or to restart the Apple TV.\n\n*The app just... won't open. It gets stuck like this quite often.

You may need to experiment with fonts to see what looks best among the ones which are common to most computers.  My TextEdit version with Helvetica below:\n\n\nA: Delta with circumflex has not been coded as a single character (precomposed character), so at the character level the only option is to use the letter delta followed by U+0302 COMBINING CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, as @TomGewecke suggests.\nThe font issue is tricky. First, there are literally no standard fonts in the sense that some fonts would be available on all platforms. To begin with, Android devices have their own limited repertoire of fonts, which do not exist on other platforms (unless installed separately). Second, in most fonts this combination is rendered in an awful way. This may partly depend on rendering software, partly on font design.\nAlthough Tom’s image shows a nice delta with circumflex, the Helvetica font is not installed in most computers of the world. Its Windows counterpart, has the circumflex badly misplaced. The following screenshot is from Win 7 version of Word 2007:\n\n(Equation Tools have a construct for adding a circumflex, but as the image shows, it’s odd-looking. Besides, Equation Tools work only when creating a .docx file, and such files cannot be read by old versions of Word.)\nIn most fonts, the rendering is closer to the Arial problem than the Cambria rendering. So if I had to compose a Word document to be readable across platforms, I would use the Cambria font and save the document with font embedding enabled (Word settings, section Save; check the checkbox for including only the characters actually used, since otherwise you get a few extra megabytes in the file).\nYour mileage may vary. Using Helvetica for this specific character, with font embedding, may be a feasible option. However, since the notation is essentially mathematical and since math texts are generally better rendered in serif fonts, I would look for a suitable serif font in the system.\n", "Q: Programmatically Change Screen Saver \"Start after\" time I would like to change the time before my screen saver starts based on WiFi network.

I work for a large faceless corporation, and they're rolling out some new software for email. As part of the install, it's asking me to install a \"Profile\" which contains a \"Device Enrollment Challenge\". \n\nMy question is, should I be nervous about this? What privacy issues should I be concerned about, if any?\n\nA: I would never recommend supervision on a personal device and recommend caution with normal enrollment.\n\ngo to Settings > General > About and look for this line of text under the name of the device: “This [iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch] is Supervised. [Organization name] can monitor your internet traffic and locate this device.”\n\nThe only exception is if you spend a few hours really understanding exactly how your IT department will collect information from your personal phone, I would consider allowing this if you gain a huge benefit from the convenience of not having work pay for your mobile device (and the hassle of carrying two devices).\nThe job of all IT is to control everything from DNS to traffic analysis to prohibiting games and being able to locate and remotely wipe devices. Good IT does this in a transparent and positive manner. Same as HR - it always exists to protect the company first, only “good HR” also protects employees and is transparent.\nThis alert is your first and only step to stop that from happening on your personal device.\nApple wants you to know you’re giving up privacy here, since MDM can be configured to give the corporation deep control over your personal device. Apple does also give you very granular details on what any specific Device Enrollment Challenge will do on your device, but only after you grant that access. (You get an overview of the capabilities before you opt in to trusting the enrollment - but you get the details once the profile is actually installed by inspecting in in the Settings app under Profiles).\nYou can make a back up of your phone and then install the profile. Once it's installed, you can inspect all the changes it can and has made and then decide to remove the profile / leave the profile / wipe the device and start from your backup.\nIf you are interested in testing out your own MDM, you can avail yourself of a free solution for 3 devices called JAMF Now.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/\nn.b. I don't get any compensation from Bushel/JAMF - just a satisfied tester and now user of the cloud based service.\nOnce you set up an MDM, you can see the sorts of things that MDM does and make your own signed profiles to test things out before you decide to trust your IT department. For most people, I would default to “send me whichever devices that I need to do my job.” Unless you want to learn the tech, it’s easier to be professional on your work devices and be a private person on your personal devices.\n\nA: Any requests to install a profile containing Device Enrollment will have come from your corporate MDM (mobile device management) server and so can be trusted if it's a corporate device. If it's a personal device you should ask the head tech about any restrictions which may be put in place on your device by the profile. Chances are there won't be any problems if the profiles have been well implemented but it's worth double checking anyway.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite change sound output while headphones plugged in I've a problem which is my headphones' jack is broken into my computer. I can't hear any voice neither from headphones nor from internal speakers. \nWhat I need is, to hear some sound from internal speakers while my headphones' jack is broken in my computer. \nThanks in advance..\n\nA: If you have a Macbook Pro with only one jack input (no separate inputs for microphone/headphones), try alt (option) clicking the Sound Menu in the menu bar and selecting \"Use Audio port for\" -> Input. This way the system will think that you want to use what's plugged in as microphone and not as headphones and you will be able to use the speakers once again.\n\n\nA: Just pull the headphone jack from computer out a few times very quickly.\n\nA: What's unclear from your initial question, is, if something is physically stuck in your headphone jack, or if you just assume \"it is broken\" because you can no longer hear sound from your internal speakers.\nIf a headphone cable broke and a physical part is remaining inside the headphone jack, you need to remove that part. There are several ways to go about that. I was once able to grab a stuck part with a very small forceps.\nThere's a known issue where MacBook Pros think, an optical cable is connected to the headphone jack although that is not true. In that case, insert a headphone jack and remove it again (this may take up to 1 or 2 minutes) but eventually your internal speakers will come back on, once the MacBook understands that nothing is connected to the headphone jack. If your MacBook indeed thinks there's an optical cable connected, you'll see a red light in that headphone jack.\n", "Q: Is there a way to kill an unresponsive applescript launched by an application without killing the application? I've got an AppleScript that I usually launch out of Quicksilver, but occasionally, the script hangs, never exiting. (I think it's waiting on a non-existent window to appear).\nThis results in Quicksilver being monopolized, waiting for the script to die off.\nIf this were a Windows box, there would be a \"scripting host\" process I could end to fix this, but I'm not sure if OS X has a similar process. Nothing jumps out at me in the process list.\nOf course, I could just kill and restart Quicksilver, but I'm wondering if there's an explicit way to just kill a runaway applescript that's running in the context of another application?\n\nA: It looks like the AppleScript is run within Quicksilver’s process (depending on how you run it). If that’s the case, you’d need to relaunch Quicksilver. If it’s not completely frozen, you can do this quickly with ⌃⌘Q.\nIt might also be possible to set some kind of timeout in the script to prevent it from hanging indefinitely.\n", "Q: When saving a document or editing a file name, with the focus on the string itself, why does CMD+Delete move the file or folder to the trash? To be more specific, I am saving a file from my markdown editor. Within the save dialog box, I navigate to the folder I wish to save the file. I then decide to change the name of the file. I put my cursor at the end of the text string and hit CMD + Delete. The expected behavior is to delete the entire string. Instead, this deletes the previously selected folder I highlighted in the dialog box. \nTypically, I expect CMD + Delete to remove an entire line of text. I also tested this with renaming a file. If my focus is on the string name of the file, why would CMD+delete remove the file, when Option+Delete removes individual words as expected. \nI can do screen shots or short movie if this is confusing. I don't recall this happening previously but I'm not often creating files outside of Python.\n13\" rMBP using 10.10.1\n\nA: If the file name is highlighted then just use Delete, not the CMD+Delete.\nThe CMD+Delete will also delete the file on my MBA with 10.9.5 Finder.\n\nA: when saving a file, by default the entire name excluding .extension ought to be selected, so just starting to type will rename it.\nTo navigate,  \n\n\n*\n\n*forward arrow will go to the end of the filename, before the extension  \n\n*up arrow [or back arrow initially, until the fully-selected name is 'broken'] will go to the beginning,  \n\n*down arrow to the end, if you want to accept the original name but add prefix/suffix etc \n\n", "Q: iMac 27\" Mid 2010 RAM Upgrade I have an iMac 27\", Mid 2010 (11,3 model). Can it take 8GB RAM modules? Apple's website http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht4255 says \"The maximum amount of RAM you can install in your computer is 16 GB (a 4 GB SO-DIMM in each slot).\" But people say that 8 GB sticks ARE in fact supported. For instance, according to OWC, (http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/iMac/2010/DDR3_21.5_27) 8.0GB PC10600 DDR3 Module (http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/1333DDR3S8GB/) works.\nIn particular, can I use Transcend JetRAM DDR3 8GB JM1333KSH-8G http://www.flipkart.com/transcend-jetram-ddr3-8-gb-laptop-dram-jm1333ksh-8g/p/itmdfzhzd2v8mtza?pid=RAMDFZHXPYRVVGJA ?\nAnd how about Transcend JetRAM DDR3 4GB JM1333KSN-4G http://www.flipkart.com/transcend-ddr3-4-gb-laptop-dram-jm1333ksn-4g/p/itmdv6g6gnnsnkvc?pid=RAMD2RYPNQKZ5TJV ?\n\nA: The answer is 'Yes, it will take them.' 8GB sticks were 'unsupported' at that time, but just turned out they worked.\nI have an old Mac Pro that has the same 'unofficial' double-storage. Shoudld take 32GB 8x4, does in fact take 64GB, 8x8.\nIt's only the 21\" iMac from that series that really can only take 16GB\nRef - Everymac & personal experience.\nFor specifically which sticks it will take, OWC doesn't ship here so I've never tested their algorithms. I would use Crucial's detector tool, which has never let me down.\n", "Q: Which URL does Apple request when connecting to a Wi-Fi network to look for redirects? I remember reading somewhere that when you connect to a Wi-Fi network, Apple tries accessing their own URL which is guaranteed not to follow any redirects. (E.g. http://apple.com/no-redirects). If it sees a redirect, it assumes you are on a Wi-Fi network that needs you to login, so it presents the login screen. Otherwise, if it was able to reach that URL with no redirects, it will just assume you are connected to the internet normally.\nWhat is this URL, and where can I get more info about the mechanism Apple uses?\n\nA: I found it. Apple uses http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html\nMore information can be found at http://blog.erratasec.com/2010/09/apples-secret-wispr-request.html#.VLA9UsabLOY\nThe advantage of using a no redirect URL is that you can determine which state you are in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected\n\n*Connected to Wi-Fi but Internet is inaccessible due to Wi-Fi router requiring user intervention.\n\n*Not connected\n\n\nThese are called captive portals, or, as Apple calls them, captive networks:\n\nCaptive networks (often used in hotels, coffee shops, and other public places) may intercept your software’s HTTP requests and provide a login page instead of the expected data.\n\n", "Q: Source of grease inside unibody macbook? I have a unibody 2012 macbook which appears to have some kind of grease around the battery area, between the battery and the case.\nThis machine has been serviced by a third party applecare provider for hard drive cable failure several times, and I'm wondering if that's something they might have left in there for some reason?\nAre there any pads/components/labels that sometimes leach grease under high temperature?\nThe only other plausible explanation would be that it has somehow leached in through the screw holes (there is no contamination in the keyboard/motherboard/optical area, so it can't have come from above), which I also find pretty hard to believe.\nVisually it looks like a sticky drink has dried up, but when you touch it it has the consistency of vaseline.\nPicture (apologies for poor quality, phone is all that's available):\n\nAll plausible theories appreciated!\n\nA: There is one source of Grease looking like component inside your Mac.\nThe Thermal paste used between the chips and heat sink.\nWho ever did the job made a mess out of it without cleaning it.\n", "Q: Changing dev environment to Homebrew I'm a new mac user and I'm going to start using Homebrew to build my environment.

Homebrew will error if it has to overwrite an existing file in the process of installing a package.\n", "Q: Yosemite keeps restarting or going into grey screen I have an iMac from 2011 and I have installed Yosemite as soon as it was released, without any issues before this one. \nHere is what happened: it has suddenly shut itself off, after turning it on, it goes into the loading screen, loads to about half of the loading bar and restarts itself, this happens in a loop.\nI have tried internet recovery. After choosing the network, connecting, and going through the loading screen, the screen becomes grey. Same thing when I try recovery mode or when I boot from external usb device. I am able to enter the verbose mode and I was able to do system check, which did not find any issues.\nNot sure what to do and whether this is a hardware or a software problem.\n\nA: These symptoms imply an issue with your GPU. There is actually an ongoing class-action lawsuit against Apple regarding the AMD GPUs in the 2011 Macs (primarily MacBook Pros). I have seen the issue before in person; my sister's MacBook Pro just encountered it. The symptoms were just as you described: boot chime, Apple logo, spinning loader, grey screen, nothing else. Apple had recently started using lead-free solder for internal components in order to adhere to EU environmental regulations, but the solder is more prone to stress and cracking from rapid heat fluctuation, which can cause the GPU to slowly separate from the logic board. If this is in fact the case, you have 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow Apple to repair it: This will run you $310 if your machine is not under warranty (unlikely, since your machine is 3-4 years old). Apple will replace your entire logic board, which includes the GPU. The only problem with this is that they will be swapping in a logic board with the exact same lead-free solder, which one can consider to be a manufacturing defect. The new board will still likely fail in the future...which is why this issue is big enough to elicit a lawsuit.\n\n*Reball: Some 3rd-party computer repair establishments can remove the GPU from the logic board, replace the lead-free solder with lead-based solder, and fix the GPU back onto the logic board. This process is known as \"reballing.\" It is often cheaper than the Apple repair, and more reliable (as long as the repair place is reputable, of course). This would void your warranty, but if you've read this far, yours probably expired already anyway.\n\n*Reflow: If you're willing to get your hands dirty, you can use a heat gun to melt the solder back down into place. This is called \"reflowing,\" and is the same process used to fix the \"yellow light of death\" issue on PS3 consoles.\n\n\nYou can read more about the lawsuit here: http://time.com/3545723/apple-macbook-lawsuit/\n", "Q: First Admin account not showing on login page I created a second Admin account on my Macbook Pro (Yosemite) and also enabled Guest login.

Any other things I might check?\nI am able to su to the old user and the home directory and all still exist.\n\nA: What I did (and what seems to have worked so far) is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*change username and home folder of the \"missing user\"\n\n*create a new user with the old username/home folder\n\n*delete the old user\n\n*use the new user instead\n\n\nI think I should also have reused the old UID because I got a lot of files belonging to an unnamed \"501\" user that I had to chown to my new user.\n", "Q: Safari keeps Crashing due to External Modification Warning In the last 24-hours my Safari has gone haywire.

status bar font size? Can the status bar font be enlarged? Is this size hard-wired and unique? Is there any other (configurable) font size anywhere which could correspond to this one on user space?\nSome time ago, I asked how to configure the status bar (How to configure the status bar?). The answer was that it couldn't be done. I sent that as a feature request to Apple. They didn't answer (of course) so I thought that, maybe, that font could be linked to some other one (for instance, though this is not the case to the one on View Optionson the Finder.\n\nA: There is actually an easy fix for this, as it turns out.\nAbilitynet.org has a nice clear description at https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/apple-os-x-10-10-yosemite-making-text-larger/ \nI didn't discover that source until after I'd called Apple Support, where I was given the same very simple answer, which is:\nOn the Apple Menu, go to System Preferences.  In System Preferences, go to Displays.  Change from Default to Scaled, then click the box to the left of the Default box to choose larger font or gigantic font.  (Unfortunately, the Scaled display options are not available with a slider, which would have been perfect as then you could choose exactly the size that works best for you.  However, the next size up from Default will probably work well for almost anyone who's been struggling to read the menu bar.)\nMaking this change not only fixes the visibility of the menu bar, but also carries over to other application menus.  For example, I use WORD, and was having to peer at my 27-inch screen from 2 inches away to see where to navigate the cursor in order to change the font size for my document.  In Google, if I wanted to read an url, I had to copy and paste it into WORD, then zoom the text display. It was VERY frustrating, and now all of that's just a bad dream.\n((As an aside, as a \"newbie\" to the Apple world, this was my first contact with Apple Support and they earned top marks from me for response time, courtesy, and giving me precisely the info I needed.  Thank you Apple Support!)  \n\nA: Nothing has changed in that area in last 4 weeks since you asked, so changing the font size in the Menu bar is currently not possible.\nIf you are like me (hate the to small fonts) your only \"work around\" I know is to change the screen resolution.\nThat will unfortunately change all of the screen not just the menu bar, but at least now I can read it without squirting.\nReduce the screen resolution to next lower number where it still suits all your needs, while the font becomes larger at same time.\nIf you find your self switching the resolution often then a $4 app called Quickres might help you.\n", "Q: Disable \"helpful\" iMac message icon when text with my iPhone So, now that I have my new iMac 5K, I'm pleased that it can text like my iPhone.  My Windows PC of course cannot. BUT I do NOT want anyone sitting at my iMac to read my text messages, or even know to whom I am texting.  \nMy question is, can I disable the nonhelpful message status icon that iMac throws up when I text on my iPhone, but still use the iMac as a text machine whenever I please?\nThanks,\nEd\n\nA: Yes, this can be done.\nThe best way to restrict access to your Messages is to use separate login accounts for each person using your iMac. Each account would then only have access to their own Messages.\nIf you would rather not set up accounts for everyone, you could simply turn off the alerts on your screen within the Notifications Preference Pane in System Preferences by turning the alert style to \"None\". However, this would not stop someone from simply opening up the Messages application to see all of your texts.\n", "Q: Clean install of Yosemite problem Hopefully someone can help me. I've tried so many options. I purchased a used MacBook Pro, late 2011 model. The person I purchased it from said he wiped the hard drive, but when I got home, it seems he did that, however his login was still there. \nSo I did a disk utility, wiped the hard drive which checked out fine, got to the reinstall Yosemite page, but there is no hard drive icon, only the install Yosemite page. When I click continue I get this error, \"An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again.\"\nImages below are in order of error\n!http://s30.postimg.org/nqvg41k1d/IMG_6344.jpg\n!http://s29.postimg.org/mwvvef5af/IMG_6345.jpg\n\nA: This is a problem that quite a few people have experienced in the past and it seems to come about for a variety of reasons and hence has a variety of solutions, here's a few you should try:\n\n\n*\n\n*FIRST - try resetting PRAM by restarting your machine and holding command-option-p-r immediately when the machine starts booting up. Keep holding all four keys until the machine restarts again and you hear the start up chime. Quite often this solves the problem straight away and you're good to go.\n\n*If resetting PRAM doesn't work, you might want to have another go running disk utility and try verifying the drive which you're trying to install to. \n\n*If none of the above work, you might want to try this solution which relates to an error in the system time and date settings.\n\n\nFinally, if you're still not having any luck, give Apple Care a call and explain that you've just bought a second hand machine. They'll likely help you register the machine in your name as well which is kinda handy and they should be able to work through the problem with you even though the machines out of warranty... they're normally pretty good with this kind of thing.\n\nA: Just in case anybody else comes across this question, the steps to solve the system time/date issue mentioned above are as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Utilities –> Terminal\n\n*When the terminal window opens, type date and hit enter. What you will notice is that the date listed will be wrong.  That wrong date is what is causing the reinstall error.\n\n*To correct the wrong date –>  type date followed by MMDDHHMMYYYY  (Month – Date – Hour – Minute – Year)\n\n*Exit and begin a new install, the problem should now be solved.\n\n\nA: If none of the above work, Go to the Disk Utility, Repair the disk permissions and verify the disk. Backup and Erase the disk, If any error occurs during the verification process.\n", "Q: iPhone - Showing the road speed limit while driving I am looking for an iOS application that can display the speed limit of the road where I am located. I am mostly interested in the USA, particularly Boston and California. Gratis is better but not necessary.\n\nA: In the latest version of iOS 11, I believe the speed limit does show up on highways (at least when you're going too fast). Another app that does this is Waze.\n\nA: HERE WeGo maps app (formerly Nokia Here Maps) for iOS has exactly the functionality you are looking for.\nThe app can be downloaded for free on the App Store (all features available, no In-App purchases).\nThe app features excellent and extensive maps data, with full offline support. You can easily search for points of interest and perform navigation even without a data connection (Solely with the help of GPS).\nThe maps data is regularly updated and you can choose to download maps on a country/province basis.\n\nAs can be seen in the screenshot, the app not only contains up-to-date speed limit data for all major highways, but also alerts by flashing the current speed indicator in red when the limit is exceeded.\n", "Q: how do I \"un-partition\" my MACINTOSH HD into one big hard drive? So I was messing around on my computer (it has a 250 gigabyte hard drive) and thought,\"hmm I wonder what happens if I partition off 75 gigs of this\". believe it or not, it partitioned off 75 gigabytes on my hard drive, so what's the problem? well I have no idea how to make it one big single 250 gigabyte partition again. I tried everything, I did the minus on the partition, I did the slide, I repaired with disk utility, same thing with disk utility from the restart CMD+R, and spent hours on the internet looking for a solution. Is there anyone who can help me here?\n\nA: You could create another partition that's the size of the other half of the disk. Then, because you can't merge your boot disk, you could make a GParted live USB, boot from it, and merge it.\n\nA: You can not do this on an active partition. You need to boot into Recovery Mode which will let you delete the unwanted partition and resize the main partition.\nSelect the whole drive then the Partition tab.\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4718\nPS Make sure you have a Time Machine backup before doing anything.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I had a 500 GB external hard drive that was partitioned 250GB for OS X and 250GB for Windows. What I did was I copied all of the files that were on my external hard drive to my desktop on my computer. I then opened disk utility and erased the entire external hard drive. This deleted the partition and set it back to 500GB OS X. Once I did this I simply copied my files back from my desktop to the external drive and bingo. Mission accomplished. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: RSS app: How to get approval for App Store? I submitted a RSS reader app, but it just got rejected from the App Store, with this cited:\n8.5: Apps may not use protected third party material such as trademarks, copyrights, patents or violate 3rd party terms of use. Authorization to use such material must be provided upon request\nWe found that your app contains features that may infringe on rights owned by various news and media outlets.\nSpecifically, we found that your app provides users with a news feed generated from them.\nPlease provide documentary evidence of your rights to use this content. \nAcceptable documentation includes a copy of your contract with the copyright holder or a detailed authorization letter from the copyright holder to your company. Please make sure the documentation you provide specifies the rights for commercial use as the App Store is considered a commercial environment, even if you choose to offer your app for free.\nI'm wondering how all of the other many many RSS reader apps got approved, so that I can figure out what to do to get mine approved too.\nMy app just generates a feed based on interests you select.  And that feed pulls from RSS.\nWould greatly appreciate any help at all, thanks!!\n\nA: What Apple are saying is that the content your App would be pulling through is the property of the news / media outlets who produce it. As to not infringe on their copyright, you need to get approval from these news outlets that you can then show Apple to get your app approved.\nGetting the news outlets to agree might depend largely on how you pose it to them, you want them to perceive being included in your app as beneficial to them. I don't know how the app is structured but maybe if you pull through teaser content for example and have links through to more content then that's where you can present a benefit to the news outlets. You need to contact someone in upper management in the first instance, someone who has the authority to authorise your use of the content, and maybe pitch it to them as follows:\nHi _________\nMy name is __________, I'm the head of ________ Software. I'm contacting you because of your role at ____________. My company has recently produced an app that aggregates news stories and provides links through to the media outlets who produced them, we're now looking for strategic relationships we can develop with key content producers to ensure our service always has the best array of content. We don't intend charging news outlets for displaying their content as we plan to monetize the app through other means, which means this service provides free promotion  of your content. I believe that your organisation might be a really good fit for this service and was hoping we could have a phone conversation to discuss the matter further.\nPlease let me know when would be a good time for me to give you a call and I look forward to telling you more about our application.\nRegards,\n\nHopefully that gets you started...\n", "Q: Clear up space on my phone that seems be taken up by recently deleted photos?

What's going on? I have a 2012 13\" Macbook Air running 10.9.5. I seem to be losing battery life as of late. This, itself, isn't a huge deal, as I usually use the laptop near an outlet, but as of late the more annoying problem is that it doesn't know when it's about to be fully drained. Often it just goes into instant sleep around 20%. I go find the power cable, plug it in and then it shows it was actually at 0%. It's as if it just can't \"see it coming\" anymore.\nToday, the oddest thing happened. I saw it jump from 25% directly to 2%. This triggered me to go find the power cable and I was able to plug it in at 0% before it went to sleep. As soon as I plugged in the cable, it jumped to 36%.\nWhat is this a sign of? It seems more software related than hardware, but I really don't know.\nIs this a hardware issue worthy of a trip into the Apple Store? Or is this something I can some how 'reset' myself? \nThe most annoying part is the battery just not knowing when it's about to force my machine to sleep. If I can fix that, even with shorter battery life, I'd be thrilled. \n\nA: I have a 2012 MBA as well.\nThe battery is still doing it, at 510 cycles now.\nIn your case try the SMC reset to fix that problem.\nIf you hold the \"alt\" key then click on the battery, it will give you some information including what is consuming it.\nIf you open the Activity Monitor in your Utility folder, then click on the Energy tab, there will be a display of Battery performance for the last 12 hours:\n\n", "Q: Manipulate incoming HTML data My ISP, injects JavaScript code into every website I visit.

It would be far easier to establish a VPN connection to get out from under the offending hostile network.\nIf you can ensure SSL connections and the network isn’t a very strong state actor, you might get pretty good immunization / isolation from that sort of tampering.\nBarring that, keep the OS updates as far as possible as Apple continues to enhance security and privacy and this sort of attack leaves you extremely vulnerable to snooping, security risks and data leakage from the sites you enter data.\n", "Q: Blocked sign-in attempt to Google Account This morning I had an email in my Inbox from Google saying \"We recently blocked a sign-in attempt to your Google Account (Date & Time: Saturday, January 10, 2015 3:01:26 AM UTC Location: Oxford, UK)\"\nThey provide a link: https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity\nThis takes me to the following: \nOriginally it showed me the IP of the attack. I then put \"what is my IP\" into Google to discover that it is actually my own IP, so I clicked the \"this is actually me\" box, and hence I can no longer show the screenshot with the IP.\nMy question is: what could have caused this? I went to bed before midnight; I think I closed the lid last night (in which case the machine should have been in sleep mode), but even if I didn't -- I usually leave it on some radio station when I sleep -- it hasn't given me any warnings before, so why now?\nThe page says it isn't my Mac that is causing the problem. But the only other device I have is my android phone and the Wi-Fi is disabled, and it doesn't have any 3G type Internet. I keep those things off to save battery. It did have Bluetooth on (I must have forgotten to turn that off days back).\nI've also got a standard Apple issue keyboard and trackpad, and this morning the trackpad bleated about wanting new batteries.\nThat's it! That's all the electronic things I have.  And a Wi-Fi repeater which plugs into the downstairs router via an Ethernet cable.\nSo what could this warning be?  Someone else is attempting to sign into my account from my home IP? That's really unlikely. It is a family home, I doubt one of my family is trying to hack me, I would however be impressed if this were the case.  I haven't handed down any old computer equipment either.\nSo I have no clue. \nCan anyone think of any possible explanation?\n\nA: This question was asked a while ago, I'm not sure if you've solved the problem. If you have, please enlighten me! I've been having the same issue (not quite every time, but almost every time I turn my Mac on). As with you, the location is my hometown.\nI've done some Googling, somewhat ironically, and it seems to be a security issue with OSX Yosemite causing it, though I must confess I don't know the details.\nThis thread says: \n\n\"I received the same emails the same day I upgraded to OS X Yosemite\n  and setup my Gmail account in Apple Mail. Its not a bug, but only\n  security changes that have happened on Google's end of things. All you\n  have to do is follow the link and enable \"Access for less secure\n  apps\". Thats what I did and I haven't received the emails since.\"\n\nHowever, I'm not a fan of allowing less secure apps, in case there is a genuine security issue (which this doesn't appear to be). \nAnother discussion says:\n\n\"I've found a way to solve it: just went to Settings, Internet\n  Accounts and deleted my Gmail account. Put it back and it's working\n  fine now.\"\n\nIt appears to be a fairly common problem (Google \"Yosemite gmail sign in blocked\"). I have tried the solution above and haven't received any more emails, but if it doesn't seem to work, I'll update this answer.\n\nUPDATE: It happened again, which I'm fairly unchuffed with. After rooting around on Google, I found this:\n\nGoogle may block sign in attempts from some apps or devices that do\n  not use modern security standards. Since these apps and devices are\n  easier to break into, blocking them helps keep your account safer.\n  Some examples of apps that do not support the latest security\n  standards include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The Mail app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or below\n  \n*The Mail app on your Windows phone preceding the 8.1 release \n  \n*Some Desktop mail clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird \n  \n  \n  To help keep your account secure, we may block these less secure apps\n  from accessing your account, and you’ll see a “Password incorrect”\n  error when trying to sign in. If this is the case, you have two\n  options:\nUpgrade to a more secure app that uses the most up to date security\n  measures. All Google products, like Gmail, use the latest security\n  measures. Go to Allow less secure apps and choose “Allow” to let less\n  secure apps access your Google account. We don't recommend this option\n  because it may make it easier for someone to gain access to your\n  account.\n\nSo, bearing this in mind, it seems to be using a client of some kind causing the issue, which fits in with previous suspicions. So, for anyone facing this issue, be aware that your mail client may not be using the \"modern security standards\" that Google wants, and that this may the root of the issue. The fix is likely to be wait for an update to the client, or use a different one when accessing your Gmail account (or select \"Allow less secure apps\" in your Google settings).\n", "Q: TextEdit app always opens with File Open dialog Every time I open my TextEdit app it starts with the File Open dialog open.\nHow do I stop this?\n\nA: I find this behaviour irritating too. I believe Mountain Lion introduced a new Open dialog to provide the option to save a new file in iCloud so that it’s available from other iOS devices. You can disable this feature by going to System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive Options then untick TextEdit.app and any other apps that have a similar behaviour.\n", "Q: What are the dimensions for the apple dock icons?

It sits there with the Apple icon on the screen and sometimes it has a spinning little icon in the middle.  I sure would appreciate some help.\n\nA: First of all, I assume that you have enough battery power on the iPadWhen you see the apple icon on your ipad, hold the power- and home button for several seconds. The ipad will turn off and back on again. After this you can release the buttons when the apple logo is visible.\nWhen the ipad is still stuck on the loading screen, you could preform a DFU (device firmware reset)-reset. Do not forget: by preforming a dfu-reset, all data will be deleted from the iPad.\nA tutorial on how to enter dfu-mode can be found here\nMake sure that the ad is turned on before you start following the tutorial.\nTo check if you successfully entered dfu- mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*there should be an iTunes logo with a lightning/30-pins cable on the screen of the ipad\n\n*when the device is connected to iTunes, you should get a popup that the device is in restore mode and it has to be restoren before it can be used.\n\n\nA: I recommend a DFU mode and then restore.\n", "Q: In OS X, how does manually sandboxing an application from the internet compare to blocking it with Little Snitch? I want to prevent inbound and outbound connections to one application. I can buy Little Snitch if it's the best option, but it feels like I wouldn't be getting much value out of it for that one use.\nI've been trying to read up on OSX's ability to manually sandbox applications from functions you can specify. I'm wondering if this is something worth pursuing - meaning will it be as good (or more effective) than Little Snitch to block one application only, and how complex is it to set up for an OS X novice?\nI've been trying to work out exactly how to go about this. 'man sandbox-exec' probably tells me all I need to know, but I need more dumbed-down steps of the whole process if possible.\n\nA: For most purposes, the following is good enough for most situations:\nsandbox-exec -n no-network command\nHowever, it's not more effective—there's numerous ways of apps escaping the sandbox.

Also happens in other apple apps like messages and email. For spotlight key board you'll need to go to another app that uses a keyboard and then switch to the standard apple keyboard. Then go back to spotlight and should be fine. For messahes and email apps you have to kill the app and restart it (double click the home button, then swipe the offending app upwards).

I live in USA and took my VZW iPhone 5s to Scotland; I never purchased a SIM card to use there. I noticed that my iPhone pictures uploaded to Flickr have accurate location data associated with each picture. Example, I was walking around Edinburgh and taking pictures without WiFi/cell connection, but the images still display accurate location of where I took images. \nHow is that possible?\n\nA: an iPhone has GPS - see Understanding privacy and Location Services on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with iOS 8\nAbout location precision or accuracy\nDepending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi5 and cell tower locations or iBeacons.\nApps that can show your location on the screen, including Maps, show your current (approximate) location using a blue marker. If your location can't be determined precisely, you'll see a blue circle around the marker. The size of the circle shows how precisely your location can be determined—the smaller the circle, the greater the precision.\nWhen Location Services is active, a black or white arrow icon appears in the status bar.\nMaps, directions, and location-based apps depend on data services. These data services are subject to change and might not be available in all geographic areas, resulting in maps, directions, or location-based information that might be unavailable, inaccurate, or incomplete. Compare the information provided on the device to your surroundings and defer to posted signs to resolve any discrepancies.\n", "Q: Is it possible to restore OS X .dmg file to External Drive? I recently traded in my iMac with 1TB HDD for a MacBook Pro with a 256 GB flash drive.\nI want to restore my previous hard drive but obviously it won't fit on the new hard drive.\nIs it possible to restore the .dmg to the external hard drive where the .dmg file resides? If not, how do I restore these files?\nI have some very important files on there so I don't want to go testing something and then accidentally wiping that backup.\nI think the attached image will do what I want but I would like to make 100% sure.\n\n\nA: No,You can NOT restore .dmg to the partition where the .dmg file resides.\nHowever you can restore to another disk, or another partition in the same disk.\n\nA: It think you want to open Time Machine (activate it via the menu bar). You will get a window showing the files of the backup. From here it is possible to select the files you want to place back on your new mac.\n\nA: If I'm not wrong, the dmg file is stored on the external drive. The source and the target should not be the same. So you could:\nAdd an extra HD (let's call it ExtHDD2) and make sure you have an empty partition there.\nThen your screenshot is ok but the target should be ExtHDD2, and the clean partition in that hard drive.\nOnce you restore the data, you wouldn't care anymore about the first external HD, and would take the files you need from ExtHDD2 to the main HD.\nYou could also just mount the dmg disk image and copy the files you need directly. \n\nA: Try using Migration Assistant. \nGo to Applications > Utilities.   Migration Assistant allowed you to import files settings from a Mac or Time Machine backup or even from a drive (dmg) that you specify. \nSee this Apple Support document. \nSee also this thread. \n", "Q: How to remove apps that are remembered by App Store? Over the past few years, I have downloaded various apps onto my iPhone from the App Store.  I have noticed that the App Store remembers the apps that I have downloaded.  So, for instance: If I download an app and then delete it from my phone and go back into the App Store, the download icon is different (it doesn't say \"+Get\" like apps that I have never downloaded before, instead it will have an icon of a cloud with an arrow pointing downwards).\nHow to I get the App Store/iCloud to forget these programs?\n\nA: This will not be possible. You will see an cloud icon when you previously \"purchased\" an app. This will notify you that you could download the app without any costs.\nIt is not possible to delete those apps from your Apple ID.\nIf you don't want to see the cloud icon, you could sign out from the appstore via settings > iTunes & App Store > sign out. This will hide the cloud icon but you have to log in each time you want to download an app.\n\nA: You can delete the apps from your local iTunes, but they will show in your 'Purchased' view. If you don't want to see them any longer, you can simply right click and choose 'Hide'. They won't show in your Purchased view.\n\nA: If you want to hide an app on an iPod 4, iPhone 4 or a newer model of either you just have to go to \"purchased\" in the App Store app and slide the app to the left, then click \"hide\".\n", "Q: How can I eliminate this repeated Java Runtime Environment (JRE) pop-up window?

This occurs when I SEND as well as when I RECEIVE messages, although reading aloud is only on receive. - I would love if someone might address this issue! It still works great on my previous OS version on my laptop. \n\nA: I originally wrote:\nThis bug appears to be resolved in 10.10.2\n****I was wrong ****\nFor me, the bogus timeout alerts seem to take longer to start after enabling a handler script than they did in 10.10.1, but they still happen and make the AppleScript handler feature unusable. By loading up my handler script with debugging code (logging everything) and tracing Messages with DTrace, I've nailed down beyond a doubt that the timeout alert is triggered for every event passed to the script within milliseconds of the event before the script itself is in control, blocking its execution. \n\nA: This was resolved for me in El Capitan\n", "Q: Mail not responding when syncing with Google Apps Gmail account in OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 Mail.app goes unresponsive whenever a specific Gmail account is added.\nIf I quit the process and go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts and disable the account, I can start Mail normally.\nI can then use my other accounts (Exchange and Gmail) normally.

I had a 4th generation iPod touch and lost it over a year ago after I received a fifth generation. Now I would like to at least view the notes I had written on my old iPod but I don't have a gmail connected to it or anything that I know of that can allow me to do this. Ideas?\n\nA: It's impossible unless a) you already had your notes set to sync to your iCloud account before losing the device - and then only if some Nice Guy Greg turns it on and connects it to the Internet but doesn't try to unlock or wipe it - or b) you find it. As I understand it you can only enable any kind of iCloud sync from the device itself.\nSorry, but you appear to be out of luck.\n", "Q: iPad battery level doesn't increase when in use while charging When I plug my ipad 3 in to charge while using it, the battery icon shows it is charging but the battery level percentage doesn't change. If it's at 18% when I plug in, it remains at 18% until I put it in standby.\nIs this normal, because generally my ipad charges far faster than I can deplete the battery?\n\nA: This could be normal if you have a lot of power being used (stuck process, bad iOS load, games or many background apps). If you put the iPad in airplane mode and power it off. Connect to power and then be sure to only do things that use little power like play a song or two or read iBooks. You’ll know which apps you run (games are notorious for taking more power than the charger can supply) and then know if even the lightest load is enough to prevent meaningful charge.\nIf you in fact have a device that under low load can’t charge, that’s not normal. This can be a symptom of three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPad battery is failing - when they age this will happen to 100% of all batteries (eventually). Some batteries will fail like this before their useful life is up, too. Ask apple to run battery diagnostics and you will get a reading on the health as well as the cost to have it serviced if you ask. This service is free for iPads 5 years old or less.\n\n*The charger or cable just isn’t sending enough current to fill up the gas tank while the car is being driven. Get or borrow a new cable and a new charger to test this.\n\n*The iPad charger and pins are failing - when you rule out the other items, this remains.

I need to know how big an image would be, at full size, in inches. Is there somewhere in OS X where that info is available? I found this question where you can get that info via Preview, but having to open each file is painful. \n\nA: Open the file in Preview. Press command + I to open the Inspector window. You'll find the DPI of the image. \n\nYou should get the required DPI in of the image.\nNow launch Spotlight and divide image size in each dimension with the DPI. You should get your answer.\n\nA: If you use the Preview to open that PDF or Pic then you can look up the original dimensions in Inches.\nIn Preview go to Tools- Adjust Size\nBy default it will be in pixels, but just click on the Units and select Inches.\nNow it will show the actual size of the original image.\n\n", "Q: Cannot use AirDrop on my Mac running Yosemite I am trying to use AirDrop to copy some files to my iPad Air 2 but have some problems.\nIn my AirDrop folder, it never asked me whether I want to share it with Contact or Everyone.

I think the computer was running the latest OS at the time the last backup was made -- Nov 2013, probably Mavericks, but maybe Mountain Lion.\nThere are some pictures in that backup as well as a lot of personal files.  I would like to recover these pictures and personal files.  The computer from which the backup was made has since been completely erased and reformated and sold.  My only hope is recovering the files from TimeMachine.\nI am now working from a 2014 MacBook Pro. I can connect the TimeMachine disk via USB and see it appear in finder, etc., but I can't seem to browse the backup and select the pictures and personal files that I would like to duplicate onto my new machine. \n\nA: When you click the time machine icon in the menu bar, hold the option key. The menu will change to \"Browse other time machine backups\", and you should be able to access the old machine's backup in that manner. \n", "Q: Safari displays blank pages for some sites Some pages, sometimes on Apple's on support site simply display as blank pages. The same page displays perfectly on Firefox or Chrome. What is this strange behaviour? For example, this link: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH15327 shows a completely blank page. \n\nThe same site displays without problem in Firefox. (Can't post image due to low reputation.)\nI have no extensions installed in Safari. JS is enabled, all settings are default. This is a fresh and clean install of Yosemite.\nWhat's going on. Any pointers will be appreciated. Thanks.\nEdit 1: As an aside, and I don't have specific data for this, but Safari does seem to load some other pages so slowly, it's annoying to the extreme.\n\nA: Okay, please don't hate me, but I just cleared the cache and cookies and voila!, the pages are displaying again.

How do I make the iPhone have priority over the Mac? I mean, I want to copy what is on the iPhone to iTunes, deleting from iTunes what is not anymore on the iPhone.\nI hate when I clean my phone, do a sync, just to have iTunes copy everything back, because iTunes database regarding to that phone is not the same.\niTunes gives what is on iTunes a priority and I want the reverse.\nthanks.\n\nA: Essentially - you don't.\niTunes is the master, the iDevice is the slave. That's the way the system is designed.\nIt works on the assumption that you will always have plenty of room on your Mac to store data that there is no room for on the phone, so you can add it back to the phone at any time in future.  \nI suppose it's legacy behaviour from before iCloud existed.\n\nA: Use iTunes in Microsoft Windows. It does the opposite of the Mac - iPhone relationship.  I wanted to \"clean up\" the playlists on my iPhone so I deleted all my playlists off my phone.  I also deleted all the songs--why iPhone doesn't have an option or prompt for this when deleting a playlist is beyond me.  Anyway, when I attached my iPhone to my Windows computer, iTunes started the automatic sync, and when it was done it deleted all the playlists that used to be on my iPhone even though those playlists were originally created in iTunes on my Windows computer.  It seems the Apple people cannot write a sync program to save their lives.  \n", "Q: Time machine migration has been preparing for 14 hours, is this normal?

I have 200GB or so under my user and it has been stuck on \"preparing to transfer user documents\" for 14 hours.\n\nWhat's a normal time? Can I see the progress somehow without interrupting it? Should I just cancel it?\n\nA: It seems like it's because our time capsule is incredibly slow just generall, it takes 20 seconds - 1 minute to open a folder, \"preparing\" to copy a reasonable folder can take 10's of minutes. This is independently of me being plugged in directly to the time capsule or going over wireless.\nThere doesn't seem to be a solution except possibly to do a factory reset, but first I'm going to get a 2TB disk and use the airport disk archiving function to save what I have.\nI've found a few threads where people similar issues, like this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5471457?tstart=0\n", "Q: Has anyone zero'd the cells on an SSD? Has anyone zero'd the cells on an SSD?  I've read that this is possible essentially making your ssd \"new again\"—has anyone tried this method? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_memory_cell_clearing\n\nA: SSDs degrade over time because the 'cells' they use to store memory can only be written to a certain number of times before they start degrading. As SSDs degrade, they start to become slower and eventually stop working all together (though the drive usually fails before all memory cells become non-functioning). \nTo help slow down the rate at which SSDs degrade, many SSDs implement a technique called wear levelling, which requires a bit of additional memory management. In some SSDs, this can cause writes to become slower because it has to examine more memory blocks before it finds an unused are to write to (As mentioned here: http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738/8).\nThus, if the entire device is wiped (i.e. all bits are 'zeroed') and the data is rewritten to it, the memory will be rewritten in the order it went in and all clump near one are, meaning new writes should become faster again because there's now all the blank pages are grouped together and nothing needs to be overwritten.\nAt least, that's the theory. Now for the reality.\nIn reality all SSDs have different methods of reducing wear so this will only work for some. That article was written ~5-6 years ago, SSDs have changed a lot since then, they've become much better at reducing wear and employ different techniques.\nFinally, remember that in clearing the entire SSD (i.e. writing a zero to every address) and then rewriting all its old data back onto it, you are performing quite a few writes to various cells. Depending on how your SSD actually works, this could improve write-speeds, but it could also not improve write speeds. One thing is guaranteed though, it'll wear down the SSD a bit and it will die a tiny bit faster. If you were to do this every week for the entire time you owned the SSD, you'd probably waste a fair chunk of its write limit just wiping it and writing data back to it.\nLong story short: don't bother trying to screw around with tricks like this, just trust that the people with years of experience researching and designing SSDs know how to do wear levelling better than a bunch of self-proclaimed 'hackers'. Ultimately if your SSD write speeds are slow enough to be noticeably bad, you're better off buying a new SSD anyway.\n\nA: Zeroing means writing zeros (no charge) in all cells.\nThe cells can have 2 states, charged (=1) or not charged (=0).\nThe SSD (aka flash memory) will be set back to original manufacturing state, with all Cells set to zero.\nHowever the process will not extend your SSD life time, actually the opposite, it will shorten it if used to often.\nOver time of usage SSD becomes slower due to the collection of leftovers (garbage), since not all Cells have been cleared as they should.\nZeroing will help with that and make your SSD go faster again.\nIt is actually just another write cycle that is typically used when you want to secure erase the information on SSD.\n\nZero-filling an SSD which is not TRIM-capable is a trick used to\n  improve write performance. SSD can write data quickly only to a blank\n  (zero-filled) block. But if there are no blank blocks, then it is\n  necessary to erase some blocks before new data can be written. The\n  process of erasing takes a long time. The need to erase blocks\n  decreases performance of an SSD without TRIM because of such an SSD\n  cannot erase blocks in advance. Therefore, zero-filling applied to an\n  SSD without TRIM speeds write operations up for a while.\n\nSource: http://www.lowlevelformat.info/zero-filling.aspx\n", "Q: Why does hdiutil fail on symlinks when creaing an image of a Time Machine backup?

Then see what changed in the file.\nOpen your Preferences folder (~/Library/Preferences) and put it in List view, sorted with most recently modified files on top. Open your home folder in a different window, open the Show View Options palette, and toggle Show Library Folder. Did any preference file move to the top in the list view?\nChances are com.apple.finder.plist did. As we'll see, though, this is a false positive. Finder is constantly fiddling with its defaults. But we don't know that yet, so lets assume that this is the plist where the setting is being saved.\nIn Terminal, enter the commands:\ncd ~/Desktop\ndefaults read com.apple.Finder > before.txt\n\nThis will write Finder's current preference settings to a text file. OS X has always cached preferences in RAM, but OS X 10.10 Yosemite has gotten very aggressive about this. There's no guarantee how soon a changed setting will get pushed to com.apple.finder.plist, but no matter. We're not reading the file. By using the defaults command we're going straight to the horse's mouth, and getting the settings as cached in RAM.\nNow toggle the view setting, and capture Finder's new preferences in a new file:\ndefaults read com.apple.Finder > after.txt\n\nTo see what changed, enter the Terminal command:\ndiff before.txt after.txt\n\nSurprise! There's no output, meaning that nothing changed. Finder does not save this setting using the preferences system, so you can't set it using defaults.\nThis isn't too surprising. Most view settings are stored in a .DS_Store file. Not all of them, so this could have gone either way. Some folders (the \"Computer\" folder, for example) have their settings stored as preferences rather than in .DS_Store, so there was a chance this setting would be stored there too, but that hope didn't pan out in this case.\n", "Q: Yosemite Finder spins endlessly when browsing NFS mounted folders I have an NFS export on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

No problem.\nProblem is, when I go into Finder and browse it, the little gray wheel at the bottom spins forever.\n\nI cannot browse or open files in that folder from Xcode either.\nI do not have icon preview enabled.\nMy automount config just has Apple-generated stuff in it and while I know what automount is, these answers seem confused.\nAnother answer fingering automount isn't really clear either.\nI've tried the mount options like rw,bg,hard,intr,noac,nfc,tcp with no change in behavior.\nThere aren't a large amount of files in the root folder of that share.\nI'm not mounting in /Volumes because one of the above references indicates that doesn't work any more.\nMounting with SMB doesn't have this issue, though I'd like to avoid the permissions issues that I usually see when tying *nix systems together with SMB.\nAny ideas or how to debug?\n\nA: Oh my... turns out it was one of the .* files in the share.  A simple rm of them all (excluding .git and/or .svn) and I was golden.\nWhat a pain.  Hours gone.  I was unable to narrow down which file it was - a binary search failed so it may have been more than one.\nHere's hoping lots of other people can be saved the time wastage.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and adding locallocks to the mount options fixed it for me.\n(Alternatively, adding nfsvers=4 fixed it as well, but I ended up getting kernel panics on the Mac client, so I went back to the default NFSv3.)\n", "Q: Am I able to replace In-App purchase with Apple Pay? Apple Pay commission fee is much lower than 30% for In-App purchase. It seems it is more worth to use Apple Pay. \nI use now In-App purchase to enable remove ad from my app. Do you think I can replace it with Apple Pay?\n\nA: No, Apple Pay is for physical goods or services only.\n\nApple Pay or In-App Purchase\nIt is important to understand the difference between Apple Pay and In-App Purchase. Use Apple Pay to sell physical goods such as groceries, clothing, and appliances. Also use Apple Pay for services such as club memberships, hotel reservations, and tickets for events. On the other hand, use In-App Purchase to sell virtual goods such as premium content for your app, and subscriptions for digital content.\n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/Getting-Started-with-Apple-Pay.pdf (page 2)\n\nA: Not at all. As @grgarside told Apple pay is a kind of replacement for credit cards and is only for physical goods.\nAdditionally, If you read the iOS Paid Applications agreement, you will see the following about commissions:\n\n(a) For sales of Licensed Applications to end-users located in those\n  countries listed in Exhibit B, Section 1 of this Schedule 2 as updated\n  from time to time via the iTunes Connect site, Apple shall be entitled\n  to a commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by\n  each end-user.

In Linux machines, there is a command called taskset, which can be used to do the processor affinity. \nIn mac(from mavericks) are there any commands to the same job like taskset?\nElse how one can achieve processor affinity on mac?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Apple provides a Thread Affinity API, but nothing like taskset.\n\nOS X does not export interfaces that identify processors or control thread placement—explicit thread to processor binding is not supported. Instead, the kernel manages all thread placement.  Applications expect that the scheduler will, under most circumstances, run its threads using a good processor placement with respect to cache affinity.\n\n", "Q: How to speed up old MacBook Pro15 inch late 2007 with 4GB RAM (2.4 GHz) I am running 10.9.5 (Mavericks) and have about 12GB available on my hard drive with 2.2/2.4 GHz.\nI have noted that performance has been getting slow (esp. on startup) and was wondering if there are any obvious ways to improve performance?\nI would greatly appreciate your advice!

Any reputable will do.\nWhile you can replace one 2GB RAM module with 4GB one for total of 6GB it will be pricey and will not do as much as an SSD.\nAnd also check if battery is still working because if it is not you are getting only abot 65% of CPU performance.\n", "Q: How to suspend a virtual machine using AppleScript (when hibernating the Mac)?

Because of this error lots of app have stopped working such as chrome, sublime etc. My suspicion is that it has been corrupted by MAMP but can't confirm.\nThanks.\n\nA: I solved this problem by opening Disk Utility and selecting \"Repair Disk Permissions\" in OS X 10.9.  I had used     chown    to change permissions and messed up my preference pane apparently.  \n\nA: Selecting the 'Language & Region' preference fixed one of my issues - now the Panes show up.  I had an issue that the difference preferences were not rendering on the screen, to see the actual buttons and selections, I had to toggle the arrows at the top of the System Preferences window, and get a glimpse of the buttons, and then hope that I was actually selecting one.  In any case, I now have panes that render, but I still can't change my Parental Controls to block specific web sites.  \nI can create a new user that I can change, but I just want to fix the 'family' account that I have.  Best case is that I hope that there is some corruption going on that the disk utility will fix.\n\nA: There are multiple things that could cause this issue.\nFor the first one, the notorious, but (sometimes) helpful chown.\nIf you have run terminal, and used chown to attempt to fix a system error, such as sudo not running due to it not being 'run as root' on an administrator account, you may have royally screwed over your PC. Yea, I did that exact thing once. I had to back up my files and wipe the disk.\nAnd second on the list is attempting to change the user ID. This will mangle your PC's filesystem, and also require either a $250 PC repair bill, or another system wipe.\nLast but not least, think, have you downloaded ANY programs from the internet? If so, what are they? There aren't many 'viruses', so to speak, for macs (yet), however, during a package installation, when it says 'Running Scripts', that may also mean 'Running chown and changing system files to the point of corruption', or even one of the many other destructive commands.\nThe third is more than likely the cause of your problems, as most users of any PC run into problems just by downloading a 'clean looking' program. 7 system wipes later, I still haven't learned that... ANYhoo, I hope your problem is solvable without wiping the system!\nIn the case that any of these did happen, the first thing to do would be to run disk utility from the launchpad, click on 'Macintosh HD' or whatever your drive name is, then click 'repair disk permissions'. If this doesn't help, you may be in for a system wipe, unless either you can fix it, or you pay a professional to fix it.\n", "Q: Send iPhone slow-mo video to non-iPhone user I recorded a slow motion video on my iPhone and I can play it back on my phone just fine (with the slow-motion effect), but when I text the video to someone who has an Android phone, they don't see the slow-motion effect.  Do I need to purchase another application to send a slow motion video to a non-iOS user or sharing slow-mo videos with the slow-mo effect supported out of the box with iPhone 6 (running iOS 8)?\n\nA: Share with an iOS/macOS user\nTo share a slow-motion video with another Apple device, just use the Messages app and ensure you're sending the message as an iMessage (that means blue bubbles, not green ones). If the video sends as a text message, the slow-mo effect might be lost, so ensure both users have iMessage turned on.\nShare with an Android/Windows/Chrome OS user\nTo share a slow-mo video to an Android/Windows user via MMS or another service, you'll need to export it to iMovie like Brad mentioned.  Here's how to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your slow-mo video in the camera app.\n\n*Open up the iMovie app, which should be preinstalled. Just ask Siri for help.\n\n*Go to the Projects tab hit Create Project.\n\n*Choose Movie, select your slow-mo video at the top of the photo picker, and hit Create Movie at the bottom. Your slow-mo video will be converted to a standard video (while maintaining the slow-motion effect).\n\n*Hit Done in the top-left corner to finish your movie.\n\n*Tap the export button (it's the center button of the bottom toolbar) and send your video with the Messages app (or Whatsapp, FB Messenger, whatever). \n\n\nUsing this method, users of non-Apple devices will see your video actually in slow motion.\n\nA: I think you need to open it in iMovie and then export it.\n", "Q: How to install SSD on late 2007 MacBook Pro (15 inch) I have a slot on the left-hand side of my MacBook Pro (late 2007, NOT a unibody) and am wondering: is this slot suited for an SSD that I can simply stick in?

In OSX I see it as one big file, but I know in reality it is just a \"special\" folder. Will the files come back as a proper iPhone library?\n\nA: The data returned from Backblaze ought to be correctly recognised by the Mac. Folders like iPhoto have a special structure that the Mac shows you as a single file, but in reality it is just a folder.\nIn the same way, Applications are, in fact, folders too - but the Mac hides the structure from you by default.\nThis is what your iPhoto Library looks like on Backblaze…\n\nWhen you get your drive, you may have to point iPhoto & similar apps [Aperture, iMovie, Final Cut Pro all have similar structures for their Libraries] to that 'folder' initially, but it should then be treated as your regular Library.\nEdit:\nI just tested this empirically by downloading my entire iPhoto Library from Backblaze.\nWhen it arrived, it was in its original disk/folder hierarchy; so had that been an emergency situation I could have copied the entire structure right back to where it came from.\nInitially, it looked like a regular folder, but [a step you may not need to take if everything is restored to its original locations] launching iPhoto with the  Opt ⌥  key down to choose a new Library & selecting that folder - as soon as it had finished loading to iPhoto, the 'proper' iPhoto Library icon & 'hidden' structure was restored to it.\n", "Q: Keynote presentation view Today when I set up my Keynote presentation, the \"presenter view\" appeared on the audience screen and the audience view appeared on my MacBookPro. The MacBook is a brand new computer and the Keynote is ver. 6.5.2 (2119) I have used this same computer, Keynote and projector for the past 4 months and never had this problem. I tried disconnecting the computer from the projector and restarting Keynote. No difference. I disconnected the computer from the projector and restarted the computer with the projector connected. No difference. I looked in preferences but did not find anything helpful in the display settings. I'm obviously missing something. Has anyone had a similar experience?\n\nA: When that occurs, you can move your cursor to the screen with the presenter view (in this case the one that everyone could see); some options will appear, including the ability to swap the displays. This will cause your computer's display to become the presenter display and for the \"public\" display to just show the slide content.\n\nA: connect the projector and goto the \"System Preferences\"->\"Display\" to check which display is the primary one. by default the keynote show \"presenter view\" on the secondary display, and audience screen to the primary display. You can easy to \"switch the display\" this way\n", "Q: What is a good OSX incremental backup software (not time machine) So I used to use CCC to clone my external drive to another external drive for a backup copy. \nWhat I realized is that I want incremental backup that is versioned. So I can go back to a copy that is on a specific date in the past. \nI don't want to use time machine for this because right now TM is already being used to backup my main drive to a time capsule. \nAs far as I know, I can't setup TM to backup my main drive to time capsule while choosing to backup an external drive to another location. \nI guess I'm looking for 3rd party solution here? \n\nA: Mac Backup Guru is the only 3rd party software that can make incremental snapshots on a Mac.\nThe main advantage that it has over Time Machine is that the backups it makes are bootable.\nIt also gives you control so that you can use the backup disk for other purposes besides backup. You can control how much data gets stored on it, and it can automatically delete old backups if you specify it.\nFull disclosure: I wrote it.\n\nA: Take a look at Crash Plan. It allows you to backup to a disk, machine on the network, or the cloud. It has options for how long to retain items and what to ignore.\n\nA: Well, if you are not afraid of the command line, you could use rsnapshot (also based on rsync). This blog post explains very nicely how you can set it up and use it on OS X. \nTo install you can use homebrew:\nbrew install rsnapshot\nbrew install coreutils\n\nNext you will need to create a config file. A config file template will be located at /usr/local/Cellar/rsnapshot/1.3.1/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default. Make sure you use the alternative copy command from coreutils: cmd_cp      /usr/local/bin/gcp in the config file.\nTo create a snapshot you will do something like:\nrsnapshot -c /Users/username/rsnapshot/rsnapshot.conf hourly\n\nIf you want to automatize it you can also create a cron job for it.\n\nA: If you're not opposed to using the command line and a configuration file, MacLemon is essentially Time Machine that you can trigger via cron. It's excellent, supported, free, and since it's based on rsync, solid as a rock. It \"just works.\"\nhttps://maclemon.at/downloads/\n\nA: Get Backup Pro (http://www.belightsoft.com/getbackup/) is an awesome tool. Great value for money, and really great features like bootable and encrypted backups, disk cloning, folder sync, backing up mounted disks, choosing which files to backup and compress folders – Time Machine simply can’t do some of these things! Also, incremental/versioned archives and other stuff. For me it’s almost a perfect tool.\n\nA: I have been using for a long time, and still using satisfactorily, SuperDuper! by Shirt-Pocket: http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html.

Then I try further to get the disk repaired so that it show all files.  But further try on testdisk results nothing. \nThen I google a little more. And find ntfs is more compatible in windows. So I mount the disk on windows and use chkdsk. 10 min later, all things become right!\n", "Q: ssh key persists even after I delete the private key from ~/.ssh -- why? I generated ssh keys (public and private) and stored them in ~/.ssh/myServer/.\nI added the public key to the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file and everything works great!\nIn my effort to try and understand how the keys work I deleted them and was surprised to find that I was still able to connect to the server.\nWhy is it that I am still able to connect without a password?\n\nA: Welcome to the wonderful world of OS X Keychain and ssh-agent! From the man page:\n\nssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA).  The\n       idea is that ssh-agent is started in the beginning of an X-session or a login session, and all other\n       windows or programs are started as clients to the ssh-agent program.  Through use of environment vari-ables variables\n       ables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other\n       machines using ssh(1).\n\nYour private key was cached in the agent and is being fetched from there to authenticate your session. OS X, via Keychain, does automatic ssh-agent caching for you because it's \"user friendly\". It can be a little alarming, but it's mostly a handy thing that this happens.\nThe default time-to-live for cached keys is forever. That's probably not a great default. It'll flush the cached keys on a logout/login-cycle or a reboot. Or you can force a flush by killing the current agent using:\nssh-add -D\n\nYou can list all credentials cached by the agent by running:\nssh-add -l\n\nThis will do the same but show the full public keys:\nssh-add -L\n\n", "Q: Photos disappeared from messages (iPhone 4s) My iPhone 4s has suddenly deleted all photos that were in my messages. Instead I see a blank space with what seems to be a file number which is underneath a question mark.\nThey have not gone into my photos that are in my album or anywhere else that I can see. I installed iOS 8 a couple of months ago. Could this be a part of the problem.? I would really appreciate any help I could get with this and because I am not that up on technology.\n\nA: Possible fixes…\n\n\n*\n\n*settings > messages > turn iMessage off - wait - turn back on.\n\n*settings > general > reset > reset network settings.\n\n*[More thorough]\nIf you are using any other device with iMessages, disable them all (sign out).\nThen on your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages.\nTurn Message “off”.\nWait 5 seconds, turn back “on” and below under Send & Receive, remove any other emails or numbers for Messaging other than your primary number.\nSo you just have one under that section.\nNow you should be able to get pictures.\nIf so, now you can re-enable Messages on all your other devices.\n\n\nNote: The above methods have shown varying degrees of success, works for some to regain their history, others merely get the functionality back for new photos, but don't get their old photos back.\nSearching Google would indicate this is a known bug, with no real fix as yet. If you have an iCloud backup, the data should be in there - extracting it would need something like iPhone Backup Extractor but it would appear that the only way to get them back into the messages, if nothing worked so far, is wipe the phone & set up as new, then recover from the last backup.\n", "Q: Directory in my mac filesystem has sub directories with greater size than parent directory I have some weirdness on my mac's filesystem nowadays.\nI have a dir in my home dev to store my programs and git repos.

Is my mac going crazy or it is git or something?\n\nA: Depending on who is calculating directory sizes, hard-linked files can easily get counted twice, even though they are really only a single inode and should be counted only once.\nThe du terminal command is the surest way to find out how much space a directory is really taking. It never counts hard-linked files more than once.\n(Caveat. If a file in directory A is hard-linked to a file in directory B, and neither directory is contained in the other, du A and du B will each count the file once, so you cannot just add the reported sizes together and get a meaningful sum. However, du C, where C is a directory that contains both A and B, will count the file only once, arbitrarily deciding whether to count the storage as part of A or as part of B.)\n", "Q: How did a calendar icon make it to my Lock Screen? The other day I looked at my Lock Screen and to my surprise there was a calendar looking icon on the bottom left.  I thought it was kind of odd since I've never seen anything in the bottom left.  So I tapped it and sure enough my calendar came up.\nThis was kind of handy, so I locked the phone again, but the icon was gone.  I researched it and the closest I came up with is location based app recommendations.\nThe odd thing is that I had nothing on my calendar on that day or in the vicinity of where I was at.  \nSo how exactly did the calendar icon make it onto my Lock Screen and how to get it back?\n\nA: This is iOS 8 new feature called Handoff more info here.\n\nContinuity lets you seamlessly move between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, or use them together.\n  (…)\n  Use Handoff with Apple apps such as Mail, Safari, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote.

I would like to be able to print emails without including the default email headers (from, to, title, date) from Apple’s Mail application. It looks like I am not the only one who wants this as the question has been asked numerous times on the Apple Support Communities.\nIt looks like the answer used to be going into Preferences, then the Viewing tab, and then select ‘None’ for ‘Show message headers’. [1] [2]\nThe latest Mail included with Yosemite (version 8.1) does not include the option ‘None’, only ‘Default’ and ‘Custom’. Leaving the custom settings empty will still show the default headers.\nHow do I hide the mail headers for printing?\n\nA: It's a workaround. But when you select the text you want to print. Right click and select under services the option 'New Text Edit window containing text'\nThis opens the selected text in a new text edit file.. From there you can print.\n \nHow to turn it on\nIf this option is  not visible.. you can turn it on at\nSystem Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services\nScroll to the text section and turn on 'New Text Edit window containing text'\n \nAutomator Action\nI've made an automations.. \nselected text -> right click -> services -> print email\nInstructions and download are here...\n\nA: I had to do it in Safari in my Gmail account (if you're not using Gmail maybe this works elsewhere, maybe not).

Is simple, all that i need is to use the Reminders app location feature with specific contacts GPS coordinates, not geocoding address ones.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: According to Apple's developer documentation about their MapLinks  iOS/macOS supports map urls via a web link (using http or https) to maps.apple.com - so to link to GPS coordinates one uses:\nhttps://maps.apple.com/?ll=50.894967,4.341626\n\nAlso just to add it seems that 'geo:' maps scheme standardised in RFC5870 sadly doesn't appear to work on iOS/macOS.

I click one, and drag, but it just stays in place and stops highlighting. \nHere's a demonstration\n\nThis has been so ever since I upgraded to Yosemite\nI've tried killing it with\nkillall Dock\n\nTo no avail. It just stays stuck.\nAfter restart, I can drag once or twice but I'm not sure what event causes it to stop. If I wait too long after reboot, that privilege is taken away from me.\nAny idea what can be done?\n\nA: I was experiencing the same frustration with El Capitan (10.11.1), but discovered that the solution (in my case) was simpler than inserting code in Terminal or Xcode.\nI found that if I delayed beyond the initial click I was presented with the drop down menu and was unable to drag. But, if I clicked and tried to move immediately the menu did not appear and I could drag the icon. If I kept the icon too high in the Dock the other icons would not open a space, however if I held the icon lower in the Dock they would separate, and I was able to drag and rearrange.\nI hope this is helpful. \n\nA: So turns out, this problem extended to other parts in the system, namely: Xcode.\nAfter some back-and-forth communication with Apple's support case team, the crash problem in Xcode turned out to be ibtoold and pboard processes are malfunctioning. They said it's a clipboard set of processes, and if I have any clipboard-relevant apps - they might be clashing with them.\nSo the only possible culprit on my system was CopyClip.\nTo make sure that was indeed the problem, I quit CopyClip, and restarted the processes, then restarted Xcode:\nkillall ibtoold pboard\n\nAnd it worked. I made sure that was indeed the problem by starting CopyClip again, then running the same command again - and the problem returned. I then fixed it once more.\nI figured the problem might be the same for the Dock, so I killed it:\nkillall Dock\n\nAnd voila, it was functioning again!\nTL;DR: Applications that provide special handling for the clipboard, such as CopyClip or PushBullet's \"Universal Copy and Paste\" collide with processes necessary for Xcode and Dock to function correctly. My problem was resolved by disabling or getting rid of that app and restarting.\n\nA: try this way,delete the file ~/library/preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and restart. your dock, spaces and expose will be reset to the defaults. try rearranging the dock icons again.May be it will fix errors.\n\nA: I found that when I turn off (uncheck) \"Automatically hide and show the dock\" in the Dock System Preference I am able to rearrange items in the dock.  But when that box is checked I can't.  OS X 10.10.3 on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I had the same problem happen to me as well. In my case I use an app called \"TinkerTool\" to help me modify some system settings.\nThe solution has been posted here as well: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168545/110691\nEven if you do not use TinkerTool, you could try using it to solve your problem.\n\nA: I just noticed this problem and found (at least for me) a very simple solution).  Certain items in the  dock are not assigned to any of my desktops (right-click/\"Options\")   Changing the item to apply to my desktops fixed the problem.   I am using Yosemite but I can't be sure whether this happened prior to the upgrade.\n\nA: I find that by clicking just a fraction below the icon, it will allow me to move it. Don't know yet if this is permanent.\n\nA: The answer to the problem seems to be is to go into the Applications folder and drag the relevant app to the position on the dock where you wish it to be. \n\nA: Click and drag quickly (very quickly!) before the menu pops up worked for me, but it's more of a workaround than a solution. It used to work fine but haven't tried lately and probably not since the last upgrade.(Yosemite on iMac)\n\nA: You have to move the item before the menu pops up. So click and immediately move the icon.\n\nA: System Preferences -> Trackpad. Enable 3 finger drag-drop.

It originally showed up in Mavericks and I have since done an in-place upgrade to Yosemite. It's a mid-2011 iMac 21.5\" with four USB ports.\nThe problem occurs regardless of whether the devices are connected directly into a USB port on the iMac or via the keyboard's extra ports.

My USB hub in the keyboard has a distinctly loose port on one side. I noticed that USB sticks also don't tend to register and sit solidly in this port. I forgot and put an iPhone cable in there. When I put some tension on that cable, shuffling the mess of devices on my desk, that iPhone vanished and then the lockdown problem came back.\nSo I am fairly comfortable with the idea that this is a combination problem - you start with a hardware vulnerability of a dodgy cable or port and then the OS can't cope with some resulting bad data in lockdown.\nLint Update\nTwo factors have recently come to light - firstly being that the Lightning connector has an awesome capacity to both attract pocket lint and to mostly continue working. A thread on a local Slack recently discussed this with someone posting a photo of the amount of lint they had pulled out (using a wooden toothpick). I said I had got more out the previous week from mine and that was the second go in a couple of weeks. Unless your connector is pushing all the way in with a click you probably have some lint down there. Another giveaway is if the connector can rock slightly in the port. Note that a port which is considerably blocked will still charge OK.\nApart from that, restarting the iPhone is reliably fixing the issue for me as of 9.3.x\n\nA: (I wrote the blog post referenced by Andy Dent) in my case, my phone and iPad are connected directly to the computer (the iPad doesn't get enough juice from the hub to charge otherwise). So, I don't think it is a hardware problem. I have not found the trigger yet and despite my blogged solution, I still have to reboot at least daily as the problem comes back each time.\n\nA: I tried this and it worked:\nClick on \"Player\"\nclick on \"Removable Device\"\nYou will see your device like \"Apple iPod\" or \"iPhone\"\nClick on your device \nclick connect (Disconnect from host) ... click on \"Ok\"\n(Your keyboard may not work ... try the step again and it will work)\n", "Q: Deactivate sound for iPhone calls on Mac OS Yosemite When somebody calls my iPhone it rings on my Mac Yosemite, too - which is great!\nBut i would love to only have the visual hint and a silent ringtone!\nUnfortunatelly i cannot find any settings for this issue.\nWho has a solution for me?\n\n\nA: There is the option in FaceTime preferences to choose a Ringtone.

Where as crystal is the name of the ringtone.\nNot sure if anything else is reliant upon this file so make a backup before hand if the file exist on your system.\n\nA: I made myself a silent ringtone, named it Apex - which is 2nd in the list of available FaceTime tones, rather than change the default.\nRenamed the original to Apex-old, then dropped the new file file in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Ringtones/ & set that as my ringtone in FaceTime itself.\nI found no other way to persuade FaceTime to use custom tones; can't find where the default list of 'system' tones lives.\nSimply dropping new sounds in there doesn't add them to the available choices, unlike iTunes etc.\nAs Mentioned in comments by Lukas, you can easily find silent ringtones for free through Google - https://www.google.com/#q=silent+ringtone+m4r\nIf you fancy making ringtones yourself, any AAC file of less than 40s can be quickly converted & dropped to iTunes with MakeiPhoneRingtone by RogueAmaoba\n\nA: Try disabling sound for notifications under FaceTime preferences:\nSystem Preferences > Notifications > FaceTime > Unselect the \"Play sound for notifications\" checkbox\n", "Q: X11 app launching seemingly randomly Since a month or two, I started seeing an X11 icon in my dock.\nKilling it does not kill any other app. \nIs there any way to see what process launches this app?\n\nA: One way would be to open Activity Monitor, and check the process ID (PID) of running programs that are immediately before and after the X11 process.\n", "Q: How can I repair partition map after attempting to dual boot screwed it up? I tried installing Kali Linux in a separate partition on my MacBook, but after installation was completed, I was unable to boot back into Mac OS (displays a prohibited sign).

Personally I like Fedora Linux for this purpose, boot up from USB and go into the Disks utility where you will quickly be able to delete all existing partitions including the hidden EFI section, guaranteeing a clean slate before setting it all up again.\nIf it's an earlier model then you'll need to find someone with the installer for 10.7/8/9/10 and make a USB installer from it, or find a late retail copy of Snow Leopard (the last copies had 10.6.3 which will start up any Intel Mac before 2011).\n\nA: Ok I managed to restore the machine to factory settings by booting to my Kali Distro, using GParted to delete all partitions (since Disk Utility wasn't working correctly), and finally re-installed Mavericks through Internet Recovery.

This article here http://www.macworld.com/article/2461362/drive-cloning-utilities-the-best-mac-apps-for-making-a-bootable-backup.html\nsays that Disk Utility is \"less convenient\". I don't understand what the author means, how could I create a clone with Disk Utility?\nThanks so much!\n\nA: DiskUtility is pretty bare-bones when it comes to duplication. You can use it to create a clone, but you have to kick it off manually, and that's about the limit of its features.\nBoth CCC and SuperDuper have a pretty similar feature set, which includes a lot of features required for convenient backups, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scheduling\n\n*Filtering files\n\n*Support for bootable volumes\n\n*Scripting before and after the run (do something more custom)\n\n*Mount/unmount the drives so they don't normally appear on your desktop\n\n*Smart copying - only copies changes, not the whole drive. This makes it much quicker.\n\n*Block-copy of the drive - available in certain cases. Identical copy, not file based.\n\n\nUnder the covers both are very much like (or perhaps implement) rsync. This is a free command-line tool included with OS X which you can use to duplicate drives. But, requires you to use the command line and learn the options. Not all that obvious or intuitive, but works very well.\nAnyway, to answer the question:\nBe aware - this will wipe the target drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the target drive you want in Disk Utility\n\n*Click onto the Restore tab\n\n*Drag the source drive over to where it says Source (drive you're backing up)\n\n*Drag the Target drive to Destination (drive you're writing the backup TO).\n\n\n*\n\n*THIS DRIVE GETS WIPED\n\n\n*Click Restore\n\n\nAs you can see, for each back-up, you have to do it all manually. With CCC, and other tools, you can schedule it to happen when you're away, as often as you want. eg. every night at 2am. You can also have multiple backups of different data to different place. eg. Whole drive weekly, and your important docs nightly.\n\nA: Only you can answer that question.\nAsk your self:\n--are you creating (generating) new data files daily, that absolutely have to be saved on the external drive instantly/Daily?\n--beyond using the iCloud or Apples Time Machine or other online storage.\nYES- use the professional backup\nNo- use the Disk Utility on occasion (few times a year)- detach the drive and store it (no need to be attached all the time). Set a reminder in Calender to remind you.\n\nDisk Utility does have the ability to clone your hard drives just as\n  well as any other software out there. All you will need to do is...\n1. Select your new volume (indented) and click on the \"Restore\" tab.\n2. Drag your old volume to the Source field.\n3. Drag your new hard drive to the Destination field.\n4. Click the check box for \"Erasing Destination\".\n5. Click restore at the bottom and it then will start copying over to your new hard drive.\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH5848\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\n\nA: I can provide a good example of why Disk Utility is a perfectly adequate tool for its purpose.\nI have a Time Machine always attached to my Mac, but that won't save me if my entire setup is stolen, or if my home burns down, or otherwise disappears.\nSo I want to create periodic off-site backups.  Stuff I need critically, day by day, is in the cloud (using cloud-based email and a few gigabytes of cloud-based storage), so I can get by with only rare off-site backups. Two or three times a year I visit a sister who lives a few hundred miles away, and I bring a backed-up bootable external hard drive, which goes into her safe. When I come home, I bring back the one that had previously been there.\nSince I'm doing this only rarely, and not on a set schedule, the Disk Utility method works just fine.\n", "Q: Weird Yosemite Sleep Behavior Since upgrading to Yosemite, I am having weird issues with sleep mode on my MacBook (mid-2011). Whenever my MacBook goes to sleep, it begins beeping (similar to POST codes on PCs) every 1-2 seconds, and I am forced to do a hard reset. This does not seem to happen when I am not connected to a peripheral monitor (Dell 21\" monitor, and DVI adapter), however. Is this a known issue with Yosemite?\nEDIT: Sometimes, this happens even without being connected to the monitor. The MacBook just goes into sleep mode, and begins beeping. Only a hard reset remediates the issue. Can someone provide me with a documented cause of this issue, and a fix?\nEDIT 2: I've been fiddling with this for weeks, and I still do not know what the root cause is. I've used alternate profiles, eliminated the sleep image (per suggestion below), removed items from startup, and I still get this persistent behavior. Sometimes, after I do the hard reset, the Mac will not start back up after several attempts, but usually does after some time. I have done a hardware test, had it bench tested at a local Apple repair store, and tested the SSD for issues. None seem to be present. None of this happened until I upgraded to Yosemite. I'm out of ideas on this one. Hopefully, someone else has had this experience and can point me in the right direction.\n\nA: EDIT:Make sure that you save everything you want before doing this\nTry changing the hibernate mode to RAM only, run this Terminal command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nAnd, try deleting the sleepimage. From /private/var/vm/sleepimage.\nDo:\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nThen type your password.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with mine (mid-2011 MBP running Yosemite), where not only would it go to sleep and not wake up, but it would reboot and freeze midway through the startup process. It would take several hard restarts to get back to a login screen. After awhile, I came across a thread on the JAMF Forums with users having similar issues. I found that this fixed it for me (keep in mind that I am also):\n 1. Open System Preferences and select Users & Groups\n 2. Select Login Options\n 3. Select Edit on the network account server button/section\n 4. Select Open Directory Utility\n 5. Select Active Directory\n 6. Select small gray arrow pointing to the right on the left side to collapse\n 7. Uncheck \"Force local home directory on startup disk\" \n 8. Select the OK button.\n\nI also deleted the sleep image and hibernate mode as per the above poster's suggestion. Since doing both these steps, this issue has gone away.\n\nA: Check out this Apple Support article about startup tones. I know you're not getting the beeps on startup but a hardware beep indicates a hardware issue. Startup tones are not necessarily only heard at startup.\nApple Support article: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768\nIssue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sounds like you're getting the 3 successive tones with a 5 second delay. This indicates the RAM does not pass a data integrity check and your RAM might have having problems writing to the hard drive on sleep. (Macs write their current RAM data to a sleep image on sleep, that's what sleep means.)\n\n\nWhat to do: \n\n\n*\n\n*Try powering down your Macbook, removing the back case and remove one\nof the RAM sticks, leave the other one installed.\n\n*Reboot and see if\nyou're still having the problem.\n\n*If you are, power down again and\nreplace the RAM stick you removed and remove the other one. Reboot\nand try again.\n\n\nThe chances of both RAM sticks having an issue is unlikely. It's probably that one of them is bad and needs replacing. (Might be a good opportunity to replace both with new up-to-date RAM, but up to you.)\n", "Q: iOS8 Health: Steps VS Flights Climbed VS Walking+Running Distance I would like to know the exact difference between 'Steps', 'Flights Climbed' and 'Walking+Running Distance' on iOS8. While 'Flights Climbed' clearly refers to the number of flights of stairs climbed, how is it different from 'Steps', unless 'Steps' refers to the moving of the feet regardless of terrain, in which case it should be no different from 'Walking+Running Distance'. Therefore, it seems to me that there is a superfluous component, in either one of the three categories.\n(Note that I refer to the manual inputting of data into the app. I believe that third-party apps would have their own way of inputting data into the app.)\n\nA: You need an iPhone 6 to be able to calculate 'flights' without any external device or manual input, as it uses a new sensor, the altimeter/air pressure sensor.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Steps is 'how many paces you took' \n\n*Walking/running distance is your total distance travelled - but of course paces are much longer when running.\n\n*Flights is 'how many times did your elevation change by more than [I think] 12ft whilst you were walking.'\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware, 'steps' is included in 'flights', as the lateral component.\nWalking up a hill will generate data for both lateral [steps] & vertical [flights] components.\n", "Q: Backing up to an Airport Timecapsule over non-Airport WiFi I recently upgraded some gear and I am no longer using my Airport as a wireless host.

This sets the status to Developer Rejected, which is equivalent to a review rejection. Once you have changed the build, you can submit it for review once again, which will put it at the back of the queue.\n\nRemoving a build removes your app version from Apple’s review queue and changes its status to Developer Rejected.

An app I submitted a while ago to testflight changed to \"in review\" a couple of days ago, and is still in review. Is this normal to be in review for this long?\n\nA: Typical review wait for an update to a released app is about a week, and then the review itself is typically less than a day. I have no experience yet with the beta review.\n\nA: Yes, apps can be In Review for a number of days, regardless of whether it is a TestFlight app. For what it's worth, I currently have an app with a status of In Review which has been in this state for over 7 days (excluding Waiting for Review time).\n", "Q: Is there a way to show the calendar on iPhone lock screen?

I have got an iMac (EMC 2638) here, with 1TB hard drive. I have read that there is a PCIe SSD slot on those iMacs as well, originally for the fusion drive. Is it possible to upgrade my iMac with such a SSD module? I don't care if it would work as a fusion drive, or simply have it as the main drive for OS and programs. \nIf this is possible, where can I buy such a SSD module? iFixit has repair instructions, but maybe I can let this be done by my local Mac shop.\n\nA: It seems there is a workaround for this. One can buy an external Thunderbolt SSD, and set up a Fusion Drive. Since Thunderbolt is extremely fast, this is a low cost, low work solution that is very suitable for desktop machines like the iMac.\nThere are a lot of guides online on how to set up the disks.\nIt boils down to \n\n\n*\n\n*Backing up your machine using Time Machine\n\n*Install OS X onto a third external drive.\n\n*Boot from said drive.\n\n*Create fusion drive over external SSD and internal HD.\n\n*Reboot from fusion drive and re-install OS X, restore from Time Machine\n\n\nMaybe one can skip the install to external HD, since newer Macs come with Internet Recovery. This would save quite a bit of work.\nOnce in recovery, you can see your disks using diskutil list. Let's say you see the disks disk1s2 (internal HD, OS X partition) and disk2 (clean SDD).\nNow you can create the Fusion Drive:\nsudo diskutil cs create [ArbitraryName] disk2 disk1s2\nsudo diskutil cs createVolume [UUID] jhfs+ [ArbitraryName] 100%\n\nThe output of the first command results in a UUID which you use in the second command.\nAfter this, you should be able re-install or restore OS X onto the Fusion Drive.\nI haven't tried this yet, it is merely a summary of the linked article! So be careful and make backups!\n", "Q: How to securely erase an arbitrary SATA drive, utilizing the drive firmware to do so? The problem with using Disk Utility or dd if=/dev/zero to erase a disk is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It applies unnecessary wear to SSD drives.\n\n*It sends the drive's capacity worth of zeroes over the drive's interface. If you're on an older Mac that has a poorly performing USB 2 ports, it'll take much longer than necesary. It'll also tax your CPU and USB subsystem with sending all those zeroes around.\n\n*The firmware-based secure delete can be much faster than sending zeroes to the drive, even on spinning platter drives. For drives with encryption support, it'll be almost instantaneous, as all the drive needs to do is to overwrite the encryption keys and the data becomes useless. On those drives, and on SSDs, a secure erase should take 1-4 minutes (!).\nAll modern drives support ATA Secure Erase commands. These commands have the drive's firmware perform the erasure of the data.\nOn Linux, the hdparm utility exposes this functionality to the user - see hdparm --security-help for details.\nUnforunately, there's no hdparm for OS X, since OS X doesn't provide any way for userland to send arbitrary SATA commands to the drive :(\nIs there an easy workaround?\n\nA: There are three ways of dealing with it:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X provides good userland access to any USB device, so if one wished to bundle hdparm with a USB storage driver, it'd be possible to use hdparm on USB-connected devices to perform secure erasure.\n\n*Alternatively, you could write a kernel driver to expose this functionality to the userland.\n\n*Finally, you can use a virtual machine running linux, since both VMware Fusion and VirtualBox expose USB devices to the guest. I'll detail this last solution here.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a USB 2 or USB 3 hard drive enclosure. I've verified that the NexStar NST-D306S3 dock works great.\n\n*Plug it into a USB 2 port. I never got it working with USB 3 ports, due to bugs in Linux kernel.\n\n*Set up a new VM and attach systemrescuecd image to the virtual CD drive. The VM does not need a hard drive, and needs only 256 MB of RAM.\n\n*Boot up the VM. Attach the drive to the VM.\n\n*Ensure that only one USB device is attached to the VM. This storage device will be available as /dev/sda.\n\n*Issue the following commands on sysrescuecd's console:\nhdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass NULL /dev/sda\nhdparm --user-master u --security-erase NULL /dev/sda\n\nThat's it. Your drive will be completely wiped by its own firmware, without using any appreciable amount of USB bandwidth, CPU, nor drive's write endurance (for SSDs). This works perfectly even on the earliest Intel Mac, and won't slow the machine down any. You can use VMware Fusion or VirtualBox, both work equally well for this purpose.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from 10.8 to 10.9 with a bootable usb installer?

Firstly, the Mac (a late 2012 iMac) was working flawlessly with all iCloud services up until a few days ago. Now, I am able to login to iCloud in my OS X user account fine, but no messages are ever displayed, no continuity features work, Messages will not send (some users show as not being registered with iMessages, some the message simply fails to send, and if I text myself I see the iMessage on that Mac only), FaceTime tries to dial but never completes, etc. This happens on all user accounts with all iCloud accounts on this Mac, not just mine. The same iCloud account works fine on a different computer (MacBook Air) and an iPhone running newest version of iOS 8.\nI'm not at all sure if it's related, but I created a Mavericks VM in VMWare Fusion and signed in to iMessages on that VM on the iMac just before the time it started having issues, which worked and continues to work fine (the VM running on the \"broken\" iMac).\nHere are some things that I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset the PRAM (many times!)\n\n*reinstalled the OS (did not clear the drive first - didn't want to lose my stuff, that's next step. and also it seems insane)\n\n*updated to 10.10.2 beta (this somehow got Messages to start sending SMS (although it is not enabled to do so on my iPhone!) messages but it is otherwise still broken)\n\n*changed iCloud password to force all devices signed into account to sign out\n\n*ensured that serial number shows in About This Mac\n\n*changed my DNS records to google's, 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4\n\n*tried other iCloud accounts\n\n*turned the computer off for a few hours\n\n*deleted ~/Library/Preferences/ directory and ~/Library/Messages/ directory to force full data reset of Messages app and iCloud preferences, then rebooted, but seems silly since all other users are having issues\n\n*left iCloud logged out for a few hours and logged back in\n\n\nAny help or suggestions is greatly appreciated it. I'm torn between calling Apple support (since the computer is out of AppleCare) and reformatting the computer to try to fix it.\nedit: Mac has been connected to the network via WiFi and ethernet since problems began, no difference on either networks.

When I get a new text, it appears both in the Messages app on my iPhone and in the Messages app on my Mac. The iPhone text show the person's name, and the Mac text only shows the person's number. I have Contacts checked under iCloud sync. Both OSes are latest. \n\nA: I found that going onto system preferences/icloud then selecting the Contacts to uncheck it then selecting it again helps to sync it!\n\nA: This is not an iCloud syncing issue, it's an issue related to the default account used for Contacts on your phone / iPad.\nAfter searching for a long time, I finally figured out the missing info - I wasn't able to find this anywhere else, so am posting here. A brief explanation, solution is below the separating line.\nIf you've got iCloud sharing set up & are confident that it's not a login/logout issue etc then it is probably that your phone / iPad is adding new contacts to an account that is not your iCloud account.\nIf you're like me, you might not have realized that the iOs Contacts even distinguished between different groups. Even if you did notice the \"Groups\" button, nothing inside iOs Contacts.app tells you that there is a default account. Even if you view a particular contact card, it won't tell you the group it's in. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOs device, go to preferences > Contacts (when I search \"contacts\" in preferences, it gave me three options, take the one that has the same icon as the Contacts.app not* iCloud, **not privacy). \n\n*Click \"Default Account\" and set it to \"iCloud\" (if it was already set to iCloud, then you are having syncing issues).\n\n\nNow, when you add a new contact, it will be added to your iCloud contacts by default, and so will sync properly. \nN.B. This won't fix previously added contacts. It will just eliminate the problem, moving forward. You'll have to be sure that the previous default account is added to Max OS Contacts.app and can try dragging and dropping to iCloud, but mine was set to an Exchange account which is supposed to be synced with my Macbook, and those contacts aren't showing up; new contacts added to iCloud do.\nHope this helps someone else - can't believe it's not explained better on Apple's support pages.\n\nA: I have been having this same problem and as I go through this thread I found that I could answer yes to everything, but the problem persisted. \nI ended up opening the Contacts page on my Mac and while the contacts I needed were in \"All Contacts\" they were not in the \"On My Mac\" so I highlighted them all under \"All Contacts\" and did a drag and drop into \"On My Mac\" it fixed almost all my problems. \nThe ones that it didn't fix I found out that the formatting on the phone number themselves were not correct. For example the one on Mac messenger was 1(234)567-8900 while the contact card did not have a 1... so, (234)567-8900. Changing those two things fixed everything. \n\nA: I assume your contact sync all fine. Match telephone number work a little bit different with iOS and OS X, please check the person's telephone number format. and very important, check \"system preferences\"->Language & Region\" settings, make sure OS X could match the telephone number format. \n\nA: I had the same problem. I opened Contacts app on my macbook pro went to preferences > accounts > icloud \nit added my icloud account and pulled all my contacts from my phone/icloud.\n\nA: I was having the same problem, I just barely figured out how to make it work. If you open up the contacts app and look along the left-hand side it shows which contact lists you have connected to your computer and the messenger app. Just make sure all accounts linked to your contacts in your iPhone are also linked in the Macbook. My problem was I have three accounts linked to the contacts on my phone, but only two linked on the computer.\n\nA: So the problem for me was that I previously had an android device and all my contacts were associated with my Gmail account.  When setting up my iPhone SE, I imported all my contacts from Gmail. \n\n\n*\n\n*On iPhone (iOS 11.4.1) : Contacts.app -> Groups -> All Gmail (checked).  If I uncheck it, I no longer have any contacts.  This diagnoses the problem.\n\n*On Macbook Pro : Go to Gmail -> click on 9 box menu (top right) -> Contacts -> drop down bar on top left -> More -> Export -> Export as vCard (called contacts.vcf).\n\n*Import contacts into iCloud.  This can be done from either www.icloud.com or macbook pro. On Macbook Pro (OSX : 10.13.6) : Finder -> Applications -> Contacts.app -> File -> Import -> select contacts.vcf.  On icloud.com (log in from web browser) : Contacts -> Gear Wheel (lower left) -> import vCard -> select contacts.vcf\nAdditional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*About vCards\n", "Q: Leopard in VMWare Fusion I have an essential PPC OS X app. I want to use Leopard (10.5) in a Virtual Machine (Fusion). \nI have the ISO but when I attempt to install, it says that its not supported. \nAny workaround to this?\n\nA: for about $20 USD you can buy Mac OS X 10.6 Server from Apple.  I did so just the other day ordering by phone.\nThis version of OS X IS allowed to be run as a Virtual Machine as long as the host is Apple hardware.\nSo this will allow you, for example, to run 10.6 in a virtual machine on a modern iMac running Mac OSX 10.11.\n\nA: The Leopards are only supported by VMware if they are the server version. It's a license restriction, not compatibility, so if you can find a way to make Fusion think it's server software, you're set. Or just get a copy of Leopard Server.\n\nA: There are two problems here.\n1) The main one is VMWare Fusion and similar are virtualisation machines that means they run code using the same instruction set as the processor. So the PPC code will not run in Fusion as the processor used is Intel.\n2) I think that you can only run 10.6 or higher in a virtual machine.\nHowever you can run some PPC code under  Rosetta which is available for 10.6\nSo I think you best chance is to install 10.6 server then install Rosetta and then see if your app works.

I do however have a response from: \njulie:~my_computers_name  sample_command  client check in failed ... invalid destination port\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: When you say \"none of my documents are on my desktop\" do you mean that the desktop is completely blank? No Icons of any kind? So all you can see is your dock and the menu bar?\nIf that is the case Finder may not have loaded or might have just crashed and got stuck at login.\ntry this: Hold Command + Option and tap the esc key. That should bring up a dialog box with the option to kill any running tasks. Finder may be in there with\"(Not responding)\" after it. If so click on it and click on the Relaunch button.\nIf that box is empty then you have a more serious problem or if relaunching does nothing. Sometimes when you upgrade the O/S you have incompatible software installed. That could be the case here. Power off the Mac (hold the power button till it turns off) and then turn it on while holding the Shift key. This is called booting in Safe Mode.\nOnce you get the grey Apple logo release the Shift key and let the Mac boot. Safe mode turns off most, if not all, 3rd party additions to your system. It also does extensive disk checking so startup in Safe Mode can take substantially longer, depending on what is going on with the Mac. I've seen it take all night.\nIf you can boot up and log in under safe mode then there is something installed that is incompatible with Yosemite that will need to be uninstalled.\nIf safe mode does not work there could be a corrupt installation of Yosemite a disk error or something else that might take an experienced Mac technician to properly diagnose.\n\nA: I had a similar issue in OS X 10.9.5\nAfter trying aaaall proposals given in different forums and websites, the one that seems to work is the one suggested here:\n\nBooting into “safe mode,” opening the Finder, poking around, and\n  restarting.\n\nSteps are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Restart your Mac.\n  \n*As soon as the grey boot screen appears (or\n  slightly before), press and hold shift on your keyboard.\n  \n*Once you see a progress indicator, let go of shift.\n  \n*Once your Mac boots, you’ll have to login to your account (auto-login is disabled).\n  \n*Open the Finder. Navigate through a few folders.\n  \n*Restart normally\n  \n\n", "Q: Downgrading from Yosemite to Mavericks I have recently bought a new Mac which contains Yosemite. Unfortunately i have problems with some of the programs I'm trying to run so i want to downgrade back to mavericks. i have constructed a USB flash drive that consists of Mavericks, however every time i select to boot from the Mavericks install USB a circle with a line through it appears on the screen. is there ways past this?\n\nA: It really depends on exactly when your Mac was made. Right down to the week. If the hardware contains things that Mavericks doesn't know about, then it won't run Mavericks, period.\nYour model may have been available before Yosemite, but that doesn't mean it's got the same components - just the same specifications. Foxconn might, for example, have run out of Mavericks-compatible USB bus chips but Apple said go ahead with the new chips and a driver will be included in Yosemite.\nIf you are sure you created your bootable USB correctly (it boots other computers into Mavericks) then you are stuck.\n", "Q: How to view Export Mailbox status in Mail App? How to view Export Mailbox status in Mail App?\nI am trying to archive my mails: I created a Smart Mailbox, which includes the mails received in last year, then right click Export Mailbox to a .mbox file.\nIn the User Interface of Mail App, no export progress/ status is being displayed. How can I view the export status?\nI can now only guess the export status is complete or not by checking the .mbox filename contains .partial or not.\n\nA: Window > Activity - will show you what the mail app is busy with \ni.e. Exporting mailbox, copying 2551 of 3762 messages and a progress bar\n\nA: So I spent the last 3 days trying to export 500GB worth of Apple / Mac Mail and could not find a good answer anywhere. So I came up with a system that worked for me.\n\n*\n\n*Begin export by right-clicking a mailbox in Mac Mail, and click Export. Don't forget the Options button on that screen as it allows you to include subfolders, and it's not included by default.\n\n*Go to the folder where you chose to export mail. Set your View To List, and sort by Date Modified.\n\n*If a mailbox is still getting migrated, it will have the word Partial in its filename. Once done, it will automatically remove that word so you know that box is done. If you have subfolders in your mailboxes, it will first create a folder with your mailbox name and subfoldername.partial.mbox will appear in your export folder. Once all subfolders are exported, You will also see a mbox file for the parent mailbox. That is all. Enjoy!\n\n", "Q: SSD upgrade for mid 2012 MBP I recently started getting performance issues with my MBP while running apps like Xcode and Eclipse. A quick diagnostic of the system showed that it thrashed over 458k times.\nVendor Specific SMART Attributes with Thresholds:\nID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE\n  1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate     0x000b   095   095   062    Pre-fail  Always       -       458757\n\nI just ordered a SSD to replace the HDD, will this help solve the problem, and also how do I get OSX back onto the computer if I replace the HDD and the new SSD is empty?\n\nA: Put it in an external caddy, USB etc, then use something like Carbon Copy Cloner to duplicate it.\nIt will then be bootable when you swap.\n\nA: This RAW value means nothing to you disregard it.\nHere is on understanding SMART attributes.\nFrom there:\n\nPLEASE completely ignore the RAW_VALUE number! Only Seagates report\n  the raw value, which yes, does appear to be the number of raw read\n  errors, but should be ignored, completely. All other drives have raw\n  read errors too, but do not report them, leaving this value as zero\n  only. To repeat, Seagates are not worse than other drives because they\n  appear to have raw read errors, rather they are the only one to report\n  the number. I suspect that others do not report the number to avoid a\n  lot of confusion, and questions for their tech support people. Seagate\n  leaves those of us who provide tech support the job of answering the\n  constant questions about this number. Hopefully now that you\n  understand this, you will never bother a kind IT person with questions\n  about the Raw_Read_Error_Rate RAW_VALUE again?\n\nRegarding getting OS X on computer you can either clone your existing install (like mentioned before), start with Internet Recovery (pressing cmd + r) or prepare bootable USB key with installer with Diskmaker X utility or manually \nSystem on SSD for sure be a lot faster than on HDD\n", "Q: Safari 8 Not Showing Network Requests when using the web inspector/develop tools I have a feeling that I may have toggled some settings, but I can't find it anymore.\nBasically I am trying to monitor requests sent from my webapp. The usual method is Inpect Element -> Timelines -> Network Requests, where Safari gives me a graph and a list of all the requests made.\nNow I can see the graph, but I can't see the list of the requests made. \nHere's a screenshot illustrating where I'd like to see the requests:\n\n\nA: Deselect timeline (between 10 and 12 seconds)\n", "Q: How to restore Spotlight user interface after killing it with Cocktail?

I have an HDMI display connected to the HDMI port and a LaCie HDD connected to the second thunderbolt port.\nOn that LaCie HDD there is an LG ULTRAWIDE connected via MiniDisplayPort to DisplayPort.\nIf I only plug in the HDMI device it works. If I only connect the DisplayPort-Device to the LaCie HDD it works. If I connect both displays only the one connected first will work but whenever I connect one of the displays the MacBook goes black for a moment and comes back with only one monitor recognized.\nThe Elgato homepage states that there needs to be another Thunderbolt device between the dock and the DisplayPort Monitor but my LaCie IS that device.\nWhy don't I get a signal on the second monitor?\nMacBook Pro Mid-2012\nOS X 10.9.5\n\nConnection Diagram:\nMBP => Elgato Dock (with HDMI connected) => LaCie HDD => DisplayPort Monitor\n\nA: This is a really interesting question that gets to the heart of how display signals travel over Thunderbolt.\nYour mac is capable of driving two \"Thunderbolt displays\". The special thing about the thunderbolt display is that it is capable of \"pulling\" the display signal out of the thunderbolt signal. This specifically is called \"demuxing\" (de-multiplexing). So technically, thunderbolt is capable of carrying two multiplexed display signals.\nIn contrast, when you use a displayport adapter on a thunderbolt chain, the bus driving that port from your mac is only capable of sending that one display signal since it is not being multiplexed on the wire.\nThe Elgato dock (or OWC dock) is capable of doing the same thing as a thunderbolt display, in that it is demuxing a display signal from the thunderbolt wire to provide an HDMI port. If you are using the HDMI port, you can't plug a displayport display into the other end of the thunderbolt chain -- there is no component to demux the other display signal. You COULD use a thunderbolt display in this position.\nBut, you have one other option! If you buy a SECOND Elgato device and add it to the thunderbolt chain, you now have a component to demux a second display signal to another HDMI port. Then you can use the two HDMI ports to drive whatever displays you want!\n\nA: The Elgato only supports two devices (one in HDMI, second in Thunderbolt socket) if the second is a Thunderbolt monitor (i.e. a not displayport monitor)\n", "Q: How to disable Wi-Fi and bluetooth using Apple Configurator?

I see options for deploying SSID setup uniformly but not the ability to disable. \nWe're attempting to use iPads with pre-loaded references in the classroom so we don't want the student to be able to get onto the internet or connect to any bluetooth devices.\n\nA: Currently there is no way to disable either Wifi or Bluetooth using Apple Configurator profiles.

I don't remember the original OS but it has been upgraded to Yosemite. At the time of purchase / original setup I don't remember what user accounts I set up. It may have been my name only Simon xxxx or it may have been my wife only Lesleyxxxx or both. I seem to remember setting up a guest account. At some point early on I imported lesley's iTunes. After a year or so of being totally confused about who's iTunes was doing what and who's mac it was \"lesley's Mac\" / \"Simons Mac\" I decided to delete her user account & iTunes. I was then either left with \"guest\" and Simon xxxx or \"guest\"  and created \"Simon xxxx\" making simon the administrator. The problem or rather annoyance I now have is the name lesleyxxxx appears randomly from time to time. For example I have just set up an airport extreme & Mac TV both seem to be called \"lesley's\". In my user groups the only users appearing are guest and Simon xxxx. However, on opening the Terminal the first two lines read: Last login DATE TIME on ttys000 Simon-Desktop:~lesleyxxxx$. Note the title bar on opening the Terminal has a house symbol followed by lesleyxxxx – bash –No X No. At login or on the top right of the screen the only name mentioned is Simon xxxx. How can I stop the lesleyxxxx appearing as it is.\n\nA: At one time you must have used \"lesleyxxx\" as administrator account.\nTerminal shows \"Simon-Desktop:~lesleyxxxx$\"\nSimon-Desktop is the name you gave it in the system preferences- Sharing (you can change it there.\nthe ~lesleyxxxx part shows you are using a home directory called ~lesleyxxxx.\nThat is because you are logged in as ~lesleyxxxx!- Change that in Users & Groups.\nYou can also delete other users but be aware they settings will be deleted as well.\n", "Q: If I buy an SSL Certificate, is this trusted in Apple without installing cert file in iOS? I created an app for iOS for a company and I want to distribute this app ad hoc over the air.\nIn iOS 7 and greater, I need an https site to install this app.\nI created my own certificate locally and I must install my cert file via email or a direct link on iPhone to Trust this certificate and then I can install my app.\nI want to know: if I buy an SSL certificate from legal seller like godaddy or geocerts and set it to my own website, do I need install a cert file on the iPhone or not?\nMy company's site is offline and not connected to internet.\n\nA: Purchasing an SSL certificate will not require any further configuration on the device, regardless of whether this is from a 'standard' Certificate Authority.\nIf the certificate is purchased from a standard Certificate Authority, this provides the additional benefit of verifying the company being represented by the domain, but this is tangental to the actual HTTPS requirement by Ad-Hoc distribution.\n", "Q: Non USB iPhone Charger Does anybody know of any non-USB chargers for iPhone (lightning connector)?

I have this setup\n[MBP]<----[HDMI]----[HDMI-DVI Adapter]---->[BenQ FP222W]\nWhen I plug in the monitor, the MBP detects it and the screen flashes like normal.  Likewise the monitor detects \"Input: DVI\" and the backlight comes on. Then nothing.\nI can move windows to and from the blank screen (they don't display, but they do move there), and as far as my computer seems to know, it's connected.\nBut here's the weird part, I've tested every component and everything works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor with new laptop and same cable -- WORKS\n\n*Monitor with my laptop and DVI cable (DVI to displayport) -- WORKS\n\n*Different monitor with original cable -- WORKS\n\n*Different monitor with just HDMI cable -- WORKS\n\n*Monitor with VGA cable (VGA to displayport) from different computer -- WORKS\n\n*Monitor with DVI cable to different laptop -- WORKS\n\n\nWhat am I missing?  I've verified that all the outputs on my laptop work, all the inputs on the monitor work, and all the cables work.  I'm out of ideas (and also curious to see what other people think).\nJust to cover a few bases, I tried holding the cable at different angles, I tried leaving the monitor off (in case the gremlins inside can be killed with a lack of electricity), and the monitor was working on Friday Jan 2 (then I was gone all week last week, and it started being picky yesterday morning).\n\nA: Reboot the Mac with the monitor cable connected. That sometimes fixes it.\n", "Q: Mac OS stops for a minute I have MacBook Pro Late 2008 version. Recently I updated my OS to Yosemite 10.10.1. Ever since I've installed it I've been experiencing problems. The screen would freeze and nothing except the trackpad works. Actually the mouse pointer turns into the circle with rainbow colors and you can just move it, but you can't click on anything. After a minute or so everything turns back to normal and everything works fine. This was happening once per week or so and I was OK with it.\nBut yesterday I tried to update Java to the newest version 8.25 and Flash Player to version 16. After I updated them both the freezing have been occuring every 3-5 minutes. Everything else is working OK, except during the freeze time when I can only move the mouse. I tried to uninstall both Java and Flash, but the problem continue. Also I tried to install the previous versions, for example Java 8.20 and Flash Player 13 but it doesn't stop the freezing. What could I do?\nP.S. I took me 15-20 to write this question since the freezing occured 5 times.\nEDIT: You can download the console log from http://www.filedropper.com/consolelog. I have noticed that I receive certain message in the console log every 3-5 minutes and somehow it coinciedes with the timing of the freezes. \n13.1.15 20:34:01,001    systemstatsd[358]   assertion failed: 14B25: systemstatsd + 4255 [8BF02DBC-09E8-3994-8C2D-1C0A869EF157]: 0xa\n13.1.15 20:34:01,452    com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.systemstatsd[358]) Service exited with abnormal code: 1\n\nI can't provide an screenshot from my Activity Monitor since it constantly changing. And I don't know any other way to extract data from it. I was able to monitor the Activity Monitor during the freezes and there are no proccesses in the CPU menu and the CPU load is 0. But when things come back to normal the CPU Load jumps up to the max and it takes a while for it to return back to normal.\n\nA: Your systemstatsd\n\nThe systemstats process is used to retrieve information about system\n  statistics and power usage, and though it usually runs unnoticed in\n  the background, the systemstatsd and systemstats processes have been\n  known to randomly go haywire.\n\nOne method is to just kill that process for now.\nIn Terminal copy this and paste following\nsudo killall systemstats\n\nEnter your usual log in password.\nYou can do the same as above using your activity monitor, find the systemstatsd and kill it from there. (Force Quit)\nAfter stopping it with one of above, do a SMC reset and normally it should not appear again.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro won't shut down I recently bought the 13\"Macbook Pro retina (mid 2014). When I try to shut the laptop down, it doesn't work. I tried by manually closing all open applications but nothing happens when I press Apple Menu > Shutdown.

I have a Snow Leopard install disk but it doesn't work (it was a replacement installer disk and has never worked), so I don't have a working OS X install.\nI do have a Windows 7 machine.\nHow should I go about installing Yosemite? All instructions I can find require OS X at some point in the process. I can't even download it from the store unless I'm on a mac.\n\nA: It is not possible without access to an OSX machine. If you have the old disk from your Mac it might have the recovery partition on it. If you can put it back in, boot while holding down command-R. You can put the SSD in an external enclosure and use the recovery partition to install Yosemite on to it.\nMaybe if you go to an Apple Store and ask nicely they will let you install Yosemite onto the SSD? Or at least get the installer onto a USB stick.\n", "Q: Is there a technical reason why I cannot find a mini display port to hdmi (female) cable that's more than 6 inches? I've looked and looked and don't see one. Do they just not exist?\n\nA: May I suggest that you not look for a cable with a \"female\" HDMI end on it (those would typically be called \"adapters\" and would be very short.  Instead, look for a full-length cable with mini-DisplayPort to HDMI.  Such as:\nhttp://www.monoprice.com/Category?c_id=102&cp_id=10246&cs_id=1024603\n", "Q: Can you mirror an iPad to a TV via HDMI adapter while iPad is locked? I have an iPad connected to an HDTV using the [Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter] (http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter). When the iPad is on everything works nominally: the iPad screen is mirrored to the TV.\nIs there a way to continue to push the screen contents when the iPad is locked or smart cover closed? I don't need to see what's on the iPad, I'm basically just using it as a projector.\nI know airplay will continue video playback when a cover is closed (at least in some apps). I'm trying to do the same thing over the Digital AV Adapter cable.\n\nA: In the settings screen within the \"General\" tab is an \"Lock/Unlock\" Boolean that controls whether the device sleeps when the screen cover is closed. Turning this off will maintain the screen contents when the iPad is locked or smart cover closed, but it means the device screen is on until the auto sleep timer triggers.\n", "Q: Downloading an old version of iPhoto onto Mac OSX Lion (10.7) I'm in a very frustrating situation. About a year ago I acquired a white Macbook (model A1181, 2007 version) running OS X Lion. I was using it happily until last week, when my hard drive suddenly failed. I installed a new drive into it, and got it going again, though I had to start from scratch. A lot of my stuff is saved in Google Drive, so for the most part I was ok, but one really annoying thing is that iPhoto was no longer on my computer, which I use quite a bit. I went to the App Store to re-download it, but it said you need OS X 10.10 to download iPhoto. And my computer doesn't support any OS past 10.7. So I'm kind of stuck. I don't know what to do, but I need iPhoto. It seems ridiculous to get a whole new computer for just a single app, and one that I had before my hard drive failed! Is there any place I can download an older version of iPhoto?\nPS, I'm having the same issue trying to download 1Password and Pixelmator. I was able to get a 30-day trial of pixelmator online, which I'm using for now. \n\nA: Here is a download link for an older version of iPhoto: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1589?locale=en_EN (this is an update only; you still need the original, older iPhoto software to support this or it will not work.)\nThese are the release notes:\n\nWhat's New in Version 9.4 \nAdds support for Shared Photo Streams on OS X Mountain Lion Comments\n  can now be added to photos after publishing them to Facebook New card\n  and calendar themes have been added A new File menu command can be\n  used to open the current photo library in Aperture (if installed)\n  Includes performance and stability improvements  \nPost Date: Sep 19, 2012\nFile Size: 757.61 MB\n\n\nA: This link worked for me.

Just go to :\nSettings > iTunes & App Store \nThen log out and log in with your Id and you can redownload all the stuff your purchased thanks to iCloud.

It provides secure storage of your passwords, keys, certificates and other private data.\nTo prevent unauthorized access to your credentials by 3rd party application, each time when keychain file is accessed, it asks for user permission to access his sensitive data.\nIf it wouldn't ask you each time, then any application (e.g. Safari plugin) or hacker could access your keychain file and steal all your passwords without your knowledge by a single command.\nRead more: Examining Mac OS X User & System Keychains\n", "Q: Calendar on Yosemite I updated to Maverick and found that CALENDAR no longer could integrate \"To Do\" Items with events.

I have TRIM disabled! The process I want to use is as follows so I'm just looking for a validation please!\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Time Machine backup is current and good. I'll restore a single file to verify.\n\n*Verify TRIM disabled via System Report. Shows \"TRIM Support: No\"\n\n*Download installer from App Store and run upgrade in place.\n\n*Once done, reboot.\nIf all is well: \n\n\n*\n\n*disable signed kernel extensions.\n\n*Install TRIM Enabler\n\n*Reboot \nShould be done.\nAre there any problems with this methodology that I should be aware of?\nIs there a significant advantage to a clean install versus upgrade in place? I know there is for Windows, but I've upgraded this system twice now with no problems.\nThanks in advance for the advice.\n\nA: I never do upgrades any more - I made this from several times from Snow Leopard to MountainLion and my MacBook Pro 15\" Dec 2010 got sloppier and sloppier in performance. Instead, I would recommend the following procedure which gets you a real fast Yosemite installation with a fresh and clean system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a full backup with Time Machine\n\n*VERIFY the Backup of your most important data, not your applications! That means also a separate Backup of your Library folder!\n\n*Copy the most valued data onto another USB Drive for faster access.\n\n*Look for all the Yosemite updated drivers for your peripheral devices, like mice, headsets, special keyboards, USB video- and soundcards etc. Save the installers on the second USB Drive where you copied your most valued data on to. Do this also with your favourite OpenSource Software like Firefox, Chrome and your application installers etc.\n\n*Download the Yosemite installer.\n\n*Create an installation USB stick.\n\n*When booting from the USB stick running the installer, delete and format and re-partition your harddisk you want to install on.\n\n*Install Yosemite\n\n*After installation, configure your new system as you like it, play around with it to get acquainted.\n\n*Start installing drivers and tools and applications. \n\n*Start copying back your most valued data and your backed up\n\n*Have fun. :) \n\n\nYou will get a system exactly for your needs, without any old drivers/kext and you cleaned up in great detail. :) \nMy MBP Pro is now flying at high speed below radar... :) \n\nA: I think you are well read and good prepared.\nThe only thing that would bother me is the disable signed kernel extensions\nthe kext-signing setting is global, if you disable it you should be careful to only install system drivers from sources that you trust.\nbut if you know what you are facing go and doing dive in.\n\nA: Your approach is dangerous and could result in a non-bootable system. See my answer here: \nSince the release of 10.10.4, Apple now provides a new tool called trimforce, allowing users to activate TRIM also on unsupported disks. So now you can do: \nsudo trimforce enable\n\n", "Q: Has \"bounce\" been removed from the Apple Mail AppleScript dictionary?

But if you click on the link, nothing happens.\nIt appears the function is now disabled in code but not removed from the dictionary.\n", "Q: How do I delete one of my custom templates in Numbers - OS 10.10.1 I would like to delete one of my custom templates I made in Numbers - in previous OS versions you went to Library>iWork>Numbers>Templates and just trash it - but, since I updated to Yosemite - I only see Keynote in the iWork Library folder? No Numbers? Any ideas?\nThank you.\n\nA: Rename or delete a custom template\nAfter you install a template, it appears in the My Templates category in the template chooser.\nIn the template chooser, Control-click the template name, then choose Rename or Delete.\nIf you’re renaming, type a new name, then press Return.\nYou can’t rearrange templates; they always appear in the order in which they were added.\n\nA: On a mac, you want to press the control button (NOT the command button) then click on the template you want to delete. A little menu will give you the option to delete or rename it. Since this post is about deleting it, you just click on delete, and there you go.\n\nA: In Pages, you can save the template to Desktop and then move it to Trash.  Maybe it works the same in Numbers.\n\nA: Right-click or Command + Click on unwanted template, then delete it.\n", "Q: Read GnuPG encrypted emails transperently on iOS Are there any tools that integrate OpenPGP/GnuPG with the mail reader on iOS  \nI've heard that iPGMail and oPenGP, probably SecuMail too, all require that you copy & paste an encrypted email into the application, which sounds obnoxious.  Any of these tools managed to actually integrate with iOS's mail reader the way GPGTools does on OS X yet?\nYes, I'm aware Apple's Mail readers support S/MIME, but that's less secure in practice. \n\nA: Do you need to use Copy & Paste with PGP/GPG mail?\nNo, that is not required.  For iPGMail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the encrypted attachment to open it - you see the encrypted\ntext. \n\n*Click on the transfer button (at top right). \n\n*Open in iPGMail.\n\n*Enter your pgp password and see the unencrypted message.\n\n\nDo any of the tools integrate like GPGTools on OS X?\nThis is impossible given Apple's sandboxing requirements.  As an aside this may well be a good thing as it avoids the annual scramble by GPG developers when Apple updates OS X and its Mail app.\n", "Q: Transfer Notes from iCloud I originally created an Apple ID for use on the App Store in iTunes. When Apple introduced iCloud my Apple ID ended up being used.\nI recently creating a new iCloud ID for my personal use, retaining the original for Family Purchases.\nI just realised that I have lost all my Notes, although these are still on the web in the original iCloud account.\nIs there any way I can transfer these to my new iCloud ID? I would prefer a direct transfer if possible, or export data. At the worst I could copy one by one, but this would be tedious.\n\nA: I was able to move my iCloud notes to a new iCloud account using the following method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Signout (if required) and Signin to the old iCloud account (via Settings / iCloud)\n\n*Go into Notes app on Mac\n\n*Go into Preferences\n\n*Select \"Enable the On My Mac account\"\n\n*Select all notes you want to move, right click and select \"Move to/On My Mac/Notes\"\n\n*Signout of the old iCloud account and Signin to the new iCloud account (via Settings / iCloud)\n\n*Select all notes you want to move, right click and select \"Move to/iCloud/Notes\"\n\n\nA: Transferring notes from one Apple-ID to another is quite difficult on iOS, because when you logout from one account all the notes in iCloud disappear locally, dissimilar to the contacts. so I recommend you to do this job on your Mac, it's so easy. I assume your notes sync with iCloud on your OS X machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open note app, login your original iCloud ID if you haven't and wait for all the notes sync completely\n\n*Click the \"Notes\"->\"add account\" menu to add another iCloud account (you can only check to select \"notes\" service)\n\n*Click \"View\"->\"Show Folders list\" if the folders is hidden\n\n*Select oringal account from the folder on the left side\n\n*Choose the notes you want transfer by ⌘ or ⇧ Click, you can choose \"Edit\"->\"Select All\" as well\n\n*Drag all your selected notes to the new account on the left folder\n\n*Wait for the sync to complete and check the result on the iCloud web site.\n\n\nA: In 2020 here's what I did setting up a new laptop with a new iCloud account. It's important you do steps 6+ after steps 1-5! Otherwise you'll have to move your notes all over again.\n\n*\n\n*Confirmed adding a 2nd iCloud account on old laptop, you cannot include Notes :(\n\n*On my old Mac, Mojave, running old iCloud account, I added my Gmail account, just Notes\n\n*I created one note in that Notes section (named my gmail address, left sidebar)\n\n*On my new Mac, Catalina, I added same Gmail account, just the Notes\n\n*I created one note in that folder (also named my gmail address)\n\nI found that the note that was created on old laptop before adding the Gmail account on my new laptop did not sync. I don't see it on the new laptop. Only after both laptop Notes apps had the gmail account did new notes created on one appear on the other.\nSo,\n\n\n*With Gmail account added on both laptops Notes, on old Laptop I dragged my old iCloud account notes into Gmail section in left side-bar.\n\n\n*Confirmed that those notes appear on new laptop, Gmail section\n\n\n*On new laptop, copy all the Gmail Notes into the new iCloud section\nStep 8 means you can't see those notes on the old laptop anymore. So any notes you still want synced across both laptops, leave them in Gmail section.\n\nA: It doesn't work with new Notes Update (2016) there are some new features that won't be moved :(\n\nA: Just completed doing this. I had set up a new Apple ID, and all my notes remained under my old ID.\nAfter discussing with Apple, we concluded that the best way in which to do this is to open the Notes app on my iMac and then copy/paste into it each note stored under my old ID.\n\nA: In the latest MacOS releases, you can only have a single primary iCloud account regarding Notes storage (but not so for Mail, Cal, Contacts, Reminders).\nIn that case one solution is to use a Google account as go between to do the transfer of Notes, between iCloud accounts using two computers (or the same computer with a different user profile). \nGo to Notes > Accounts > 'Plus Button' > Click Google\nContinue down that path. Do this for both computers/user profiles.\nNow start transferring Notes (select all, drag and drop to the desired Notes folder) from iCloud on the origination account, to your Notes store on Google. Then go to your destination computer/user profile, and transfer those Notes to your destination iCloud account\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup to Airport Time Capsule When I backup using time machine to my Time Capsule, does this use network bandwidth? I'm uncertain as I could see it creating some sort of ad-hoc network between the computer and the disc to do the back up but I'm completely unsure. Just don't want to be backing up hundreds of gigabytes over a network connection\n\nA: When backing up to a Time Capsule, it backs up over the network.\nThe first backup will be several hundreds of gigabytes; this takes a while. However, subsequent backups are smaller, since it only transfers files that have changed.\nAlso, if the Time Capsule is not available (eg MacBook taken offsite), then it creates local snapshots and waits for the Time Capsule to become available again. It won't attempt to transfer the data over your Internet connection.\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*HT202301: About Time Machine local snapshots \n\n*HT201250: Mac Basics: Time Machine backs up your Mac\n", "Q: Internet Sharing abnormal password request My Mac lost ethernet connection yesterday briefly whilst Internet Sharing was running. \nI rebooted.

When choosing \"forgot my password\" it wants to email me at an old Verizon.net address that has been long disabled.

You will then be asked if you would like an Apple support specialist to contact you, or if you would like to schedule a call at a later date.\nI suspect they are going to ask you a series of billing related questions to verify your identity. If they are able to verify your identity, you should be able to provide them an alternate email for the password reset link. \nGood Luck :)\n\nA: Apple's official instructions for recovering a forgotten password are available here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201487\nUnfortunately, if you are unable to get into your account using any of those methods then you will have sacrificed your account.\nApple also has instructions for restoring your iPad to factory defaults through iTunes:\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\n", "Q: Suddenly Apple Wired Keyboard not working Suddenly my wired Apple Keyboard isn't working anymore. My MacBook don't recognize the external keyboard, and the keyboard is only two weeks old.\nIs the Keyboard physically broken, or is it a software issue?\nWhat can I do to fix it?\n\nA: This is what solved it for me:\n\nEventually I found this thread on the Apple website, and followed the rather bizarre advice of adding a USB extension cable between the keyboard and the Mac (luckily the keyboard comes packaged with one). Bingo! Keyboard fine, mouse plugged into it also fine.\n\nhttp://www.zigpress.com/2014/12/30/has-your-apple-mac-external-usb-keyboard-stopped-working/\n\nA: I think the problem is that the keyboard draws so little current that it won´t wake the port if you have the Apple keyboard with a usb hub. \nJust stick a usb memorystick in the keyboard and re-insert the cable. If it works then just remove the memorystick or what ever you put in (doesn´t matter what). \n\nA: I resolved my issue by following the SMC Reset instructions here.\nBasically unplug everything, power down the mac, hold the power button for 5 seconds. Once the system has rebooted then reattached all peripherals. Then my keyboard started working again.\nKieran\n\nA: I just had this on a box-fresh macbook pro. Sigh. This was the only thing that worked for me:\nTo reset the SMC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\nPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your computer.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.\n\n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nUpdate\nActually, using the USB extension lead is all that works now. Reproducibly weird.\n\nA: Just tried adding a usb memory stick fix, and it worked. I can't believe I am having to do this, why can't apple recognise that it is a problem.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Brand new iMac that refused to detect my wired keyboard.\nAfter a lot of experimenting, I resolved the problem by removing my bluetooth keyboard from the bluetooth devices list completely and then plugging in the wired keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and select “Bluetooth”\n\n*A list of the devices detected (both paired and unpaired) will appear.\n\n*Hover your mouse to the right of any connected bluetooth keyboard and press the x that appears, to remove it from the list completely.\n\n*Finally, connect your wired keyboard and hopefully voila. For me, everything returned to normal.\n\n\nA: Since February 2015, I've had this happen to me twice. Mac refusing to recognize wired keyboard (new mac keyboard received at Xmas). Holding down power button 5 sec after rebooting works for me, but this should be happening at all! Disabled Bluetooth, removed all connections as well\n\nA: On my iMac the wired keyboard quit working—I checked the USB ports, which all worked. I tried the keyboard on my MacBook, which worked. Then I read this blog. The restart didn't work but as a last resort I tried the USB extension and to my surprise, the keyboard works again.\n\nA: I have a usb hub attached to the kyboard, and the keyboard plugged directly into my imac. I tried adding a usb extension cable between the keyboard and imac, but the usb hub light kept blinking and the keyboard wouldn't work. I removed the extension cable. Now the usb hub light didn't even blink. I unplugged and replugged the keyboard a few times, and on one of the atempts it started working again. No idea exactly what's going on. wiggling the usb connections doesn't work, so it doesn't seem to be a loose connection -- the connector actually has to be unplugged for a few seconds and then plugged back in for it to work.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my 2015 Air. I had a mouse dongle in the keyboard and plugged it straight into the computer and it didn't work. I plugged a USB hub into the computer and plugged the keyboard into that and it started working for some reason.\n", "Q: Xcode 5.1.1 and Xcode 6.1 crash when creating a new Project /File/Workspace on Yosemite 10.10.2 Xcode 5.1.1 and Xcode 6.1  crash on create new Project /File/Workspace on Yosemite 10.10.2\nI'm running xcode 6.1 and 5.1.1 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.2.\nI'm unable to create a new project, as you can see bellow it just says 'loading'\nPlease suggest to fix this issue\n\nprocess: Xcode [2792]\nPath: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode\nIdentifier: com.apple.dt.Xcode\nVersion: 5.1.1 (5085)\nBuild Info: IDEFrameworks-5085000000000000~10\nCode Type: X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process: ???

Is there any way to transfer the music from his phone to my iTunes?\n\nA: You could use another app (such as iMazing 2, AnyTrans, TunesGo... you can find a nice comparative here) to get files from your friend´s phone into your computer. And then, you just have to add them manually to iTunes.\n\nA: iPhones can only sync with one computer at a time. If that iPhone is already synced with another laptop, then just use a flash drive to copy the files to your laptop. If not, you can plug it in through the USB, and sync it there. If you can't do that, sign in with his Itunes account on your laptop, and you should be able to download them from iCloud.\n", "Q: Battery Cycles being used very fast I am using a 13-inch mid 2014 MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\nIt is about 3 weeks old and already has clocked 13 charge cycles. \nIs this too high ?\n\nA: \nI am using a 13-inch mid 2014 MacBook Pro with Retina Display. It is\n  about 3 weeks old and already has clocked 13 charge cycles. Is this\n  too high?\n\nA charge cycle is just the process of using and then recharging the full capacity of the battery one time. From Apple:\n\nA charge cycle means using all of the battery’s power, but that\n  doesn’t necessarily mean a single charge. For instance, you could use\n  your notebook for an hour or more one day, using half its charge, and\n  then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it\n  would count as one charge cycle, not two, so it may take several days\n  to complete a cycle.\n\nYou can't really have \"too many\" charge cycles unless there's something wrong with the battery and it's unable to hold a charge. That seems unlikely since your computer is brand new (and OS X will notify you if your battery condition is abnormal).\nFurthermore, your particular model is rated for 1,000 charge cycles before it's considered \"consumed\" (meaning it'll no longer hold a reasonable charge and will likely need to be replaced). If your current rate of 13 charge cycles per three weeks holds, that means you're good for 4.5 years – in other words, nothing to worry about!\n\nAlso, I follow the practice of fully charging it and then using till\n  about 40% before recharging without ever leaving it plugged in. Is\n  this the best practice to follow or should I leave it plugged in while\n  charging ?\n\nEven if you leave your laptop plugged in at 100%, the system will actually silently discharge the battery to ~95% and back up to keep things moving. Apple used to recommend unplugging your laptop at least once a month, but their current guidelines make no mention of that, so I wouldn't worry about it.\n", "Q: Pages: Make auto dash to break a word to new line (hyphenation-Greek) How can I make Pages to auto-correct my text at the end of the line and break the last word to fill all the line like LaTex does.

You have to try 3rd party tools, like the ones mentioned at\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/15810593#15810593\n", "Q: Are Apple's AC Cords for MagSafe (1+2) always the same? I am getting a customised MacBook Pro Retina and it will have a AC Cord for Britain, but I need one for EU/Germany.\nSo can I easily switch the AC Cord of my MagSafe 2 to a German one?\nAre these Cords somehow patented or normed, so I can use every cord on any adapter?\n\nAlso:\nWhere am I able to buy a Apple-original AC Cord (not the whole adapter)?\n\nA: Absolutely no problem to change the cable!  Any Apple adaptor cable with a similar connector since the last decade will do fine.  Even the plugs from your iPad charger will work.\nIn fact, you also can use a standard radio cable (sometimes called an 8-shaped power cable).  You can find them anywhere, in shops for $2 but probably also attached to various household appliances.  Works fine.\nAs you can see, your Apple adaptor cable doesn't have a real 8-shape, but rather a B-shape.  This makes the cable useless to attach to your radio, but the radio one can be attached to the Apple adaptor.  There is no obvious reason for Apple to do that.\nWe regularly buy/replace Macbooks while traveling.  Therefore we end up with exotic power plugs without too much use.  Rather than using a travel adaptor or replacing the whole cord, we just cut off the plug-side and solder or screw on a EU plug bought at the local radio shack.\nCutting the cable and placing 3rd party plug will obviously void the warranty on that very cable, and might be illegal according to your local law.  In Germany this is allowed, as long as your new plug is DVE-certificated.  In any way, it's 220v and placement should be done with care.\n\nA: I have never seen the entire cord for sale, though I suspect they might sell them as replacement parts. You should check with your Apple store or call them. \nI assume you know about the travel kit, which replaces the shorter, plug only option for the Mac power adapter (without the cord):\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB974ZM/B/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit?fnode=3c\n", "Q: How do I mount a network drive based on my IP address or wifi network?

Then, I place aliases of each of my file shares (and other network connections like SSH, FTP, RDP, etc.) in that Favorites folder.  In this way I have two-click access to any resource on my network(s).  I name these aliases using a consistent convention like \"SMB - Server 1 - Share A\", \"SMB - Server 1 - Share A\", \"SMB - Server 1 - Share B\", \"AFP - Server 2 - Share C\", \"VNC - user@example.com\", etc.  In this way the connections are sorted and easy to find in my Favorites folder.\nYou could prefix your aliases with \"Home-\" and \"Work-\" so they all sort together as well.\n\nA: A few years ago I have used ControlPlane, but now I no longer use it.

If you have any other devices using iCloud photo stream, they will not be impacted. You can also delete from photo stream, just like any folder.\nIf you have a Mac, I strongly suggest that you use iPhoto, and link iCloud to it. This will allow iPhoto to automatically download all photo stream images, and safely store them on your hard drive. Then no matter what, they will be saved.\nIf you only have the one device or you sign out of iCloud for images, then Apple holds your images in the cloud for 30 days, so you can simply reconnect and the images will still be there.  See this article: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201317\n\nA: Turning off icloud photo's will not delete the photo's in your camara roll because the photos located in that folder are taken by your device.\nWhen turning off icloud photo's, you will get a message that you are going to delete the icloud photo's on your device. The photo's will still remain in 'the cloud'.\nWhen you turn off icloud photo's (complete) you have 30 days to download the photo's on iOS, Mac, Windows, or via icloud.com, but this feature is still in beta.\n\nA: Yes.  When you turn off the Photo Stream option in iCloud, it will prompt you saying your Photo Stream content will be deleted.\n", "Q: Install OS X 10.7 to 10-10 on MacBook Air MD232 I have MacBook Air MD232. As we need to test our software on all OS X from 10.7 to 10.10, we need to install them all. Is it possible to install them on my MBA? When I buy, this MBA has been installed with Yosemite. I tried to install any other OSs by using \"restore\" feature from Disk Utility. However, restoring process were successful and pressing alt/option during restart, I get only gray screen with a stop sign and nothing happen afterwards. Would you please tell me how?\n\nA: Hardware Requirements\nEvery Mac has a minimum supported operating system. Older versions of OS X will not run on a Mac with a higher minimum.\nFor example, the MacBook Air (Early 2014) requires OS X 10.9.2 or later.\nEveryMac has a comprehensive list of Mac models and their minimum supported OS X.\nVirtual Machines\nTo work around this, consider using a virtual machine for your testing; VMware Fusion, Parallels, and VirtualBox are all reasonable choices.\n\nA: I understood correctly your question, you want to test your software on several versions of OS X. I think what you should do is partion your ssd into 4 parts for each OS X version. You can install any version of OS X using a usb key. How to create a bootable usb key with a OS X you can watch THIS \nSo what I want to suggest you to do is make sure that the current files and documents from MBA are backed up\nRestart the machine and hold ALT key, you will see a gray screen with two options, choose Disk Utility and from there you will have to erase the hard drive and patron it into 4 parts. You can watch THIS to see how do so. Even so in the video it is performed inside the OS X and on external drive the moves are the same. \nAfter you partioned your drive you can start installing different versions of OS X with a usb stick, how to do it you can watch THIS\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How can I get Terminal to accept mouse clicks the way PuTTY does (eg inside elinks)? When running ncurses-based tools like elinks, PuTTY (for Windows) allows you to click on links.\nHowever, in Terminal, you need to navigate via keyboard.\nIs there a way to get Terminal to pass-through clicks the way PuTTY does? If not, is there a terminal emulator for OS X that will do that?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible on Terminal app. But, if you want this functionality you should try a Terminal alternative like iTerm2, where you can do it with ⌘ + click.\n\nA: Terminal App support open default App locally,\n⌘ + Double Click on a URL in Terminal.app (OS X 10.5: ⌘ + ⇧ + Double Click).\n@jherran is right,\niTerm2 provide the feature you want and even support trackpad scroll gesture\n", "Q: Dual Boot USB installation with OSX and Windows I have a 16gb USB pendrive that I want to partition to be able to use it as a Window 7 and Mac OSX install drive (probably using a bootloader?!?) \nI want to be able to use it on our Macs and PCs as a single all-singing all-dancing install drive.\nCan anyone point me in the right direction to a guide to do this? is it even possible? I have both Windows and Mac machines at my disposal.\n\nA: I just bought three 8 GB thumb drives to use as OS X, Linux, and Windows 7 installers.\nI suppose you could split the thumb drive into two 8 GB partitions and create two installers.  Whether or not both are visible on Macs and PCs is unknown.  I suppose it will depend on the hardware.\nTo create the OS X installer, you need only run the following from Terminal.app.  Note the partition name, I used \"Untitled\" for the script below.\n\n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\\n  Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia  --volume\n  /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\\n  Yosemite.app --nointeraction\n\nTo create the Windows installer, you take the Windows installation ISO file on a Mac, go here and scroll down to \"Creating a Windows flash drive installer on an OS X computer\".\n\nA: The problem is that Macs need GUID or APT partition scheme to be bootable. Master Boot Record just won't cut it, even if it holds a nice clean HFS+ volume. I'm no windows expert, but I think windows needs Master Boot Record partitioning to boot. If this is right, then it wouldn't be possible. \nI have an alternate idea though. Use the USB stick just for Windows. Then for Macs, set up any old computer to use as a NetBoot server. Set up NetInstall images for each version of MacOS you might want to install. All you need is Apple's Server.app. Any Mac will be able to boot into the installer over ethernet and install the OS. I've been using NetBoot serving on my laptop for about 10 years now, every since Apple started getting rid of FireWire. FireWire was the Mac Tech's swiss army knife. \n", "Q: Process named after website executing?

But when I send a video to myself via email and look at the video properties it is 568 x 320 pixels resolution. I wonder if this has to do with some compression given that it is being \"shared\" by email.\nIn that case, how do I extract the video without losing its pixel resolution?\nUsing iOS 7.\n\nA: The issue relates to the fact that the video is being sent by email and the iPhone will compress the video for this purpose. It is not related to an email server capacity for attachments.\nReference here:\nhttp://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/transferring-videos-from-iphone-4s-to-computer\nIn order for video to be transferred at full resolution, the iPhone needs to be connected to a computer via USB. This will allow transfer of the entire file, for example using iPhoto.\nWhen transferring a video file by email, a progress bar indicating compression is seen at the moment of transmittal, which measn the file is being compressed in resolution although it remains at full resolution within the phone until it is deleted.\nIn addition it is recommended to unlock the phone (if using a passcode) before connecting, to have access to this read/write functionality.\n", "Q: Yosemite divided dock?

When I archive some messages (by swiping left on the message in the Mail.app), they disappear from my Inbox, then get added right back a second or two later. This has been going on since IOS 8.1 and still isn't working right since upgrading to IOS 9.1 I figured it would have been fixed, but it's not.\nI tried archiving to different folder than All Mail but that didn't solve the problem. Also, there is no pattern to the messages. This is happening regardless of who the message is from or its content.\nI gave up after a year of dealing with this annoyance and using Outlook for now, but I'd really like to use the Mail App on my iPhone again.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nOne other possibly related and interesting note, the mail app in OS X also does the same thing (click the archive button, message disappears for a few moments then pops back in the inbox, then disappears again). Perhaps IMAP commands are being queued up, then mail refreshes and notices the message hasn't been actually moved yet, and adds it back to inbox... just my theory.\n\nA: This could be an issue with your iPhone settings.\nGo to settings > mail, contact, calendar > Gmail\nHere you will see you gmail account, select it.\nOn the following view, there is an option for advanced settings.\nHere you can change to with folder archived mails should be placed.\nPlease let me know if this solved your problem.\n", "Q: Is my Mac partition secure if it has FileVault 2 but the Boot Camp partition is unencrypted? With a Macbook Pro Retina running OS X 10.10 and Boot Camp Windows 7, my Mac HD is encrypted with FileVault 2 and the Boot Camp partition is unencrypted. Does this weaken the security of the Mac HD partition?\n\nA: Yes -\nif you ask if Mac HD was safe. The Bootcamp partition, however, is not. Any attacker could easily gain access to your Windows system or any other unencrypted partition on your drive. Make sure not to store sensitive information there (e.g. WiFi password, etc.). But normally the bootcamp partition does not contain information compromising the security of your filevault2 encrypted partition (Mac HD in your case). Those two are independent.\nSo in short: Having further unencrypted partitions on a filevault2 system disk does not degrade your security.\n\nA: It is a possible back door since not complete disk is encrypted.\n\nThe second issue with FileVault 2 is that it only encrypts the startup\n  drive. If you have additional drives or partitions, including a\n  Windows partition created with Boot Camp, they will remain\n  unencrypted. For these reasons, FileVault 2 may not meet the stringent\n  security requirements of some organizations. It does, however, fully\n  encrypt the Mac's startup partition, which is where most of us (and\n  most applications) store important data and documents.\n\nsource: http://macs.about.com/od/LionTipsNtricks/ss/Filevault-2-Using-Disk-Encryption-With-Os-X-Lion.htm\nsource: http://www.howtogeek.com/189250/how-to-share-files-between-mac-os-x-and-windows-with-boot-camp/\nI will not go in to how to, but rather point out following:\nIn case of full disk encryption you can not proceed at all without providing the key.\nIn case of partial, you are allowed to proceed, to the windows partition and have access to computer operations.\n", "Q: Changing an itunes account My husband now has my ipad but it has my itunes account on it instead of his, how do we change it to his account?\n\nA: Log out of the old account in Settings → iTunes & App Store, then log in with the new account.\n", "Q: Can I move the OS X that was preinstalled on my MacBook pro to a VM running on the MacBook Pro? I would like to run linux as the primary operating system on my MacBook Pro to replace the OS X that was pre-installed with the MacBook.\nI would then like to run OS X inside a virtualbox guest running on the MacBook.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this configuration legal from a licensing perspective?\n\n*My mac book was pre-installed and there wasn't an installation CD in the box.  How can I get the OS X installation image for installing into Virtualbox?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI have NOT purchased a copy of OS X, and I do not wish to purchase one either :)\n\nA: You could try to download the Yosemite installer (or another OSX version if your \"purchased\" it earlier) and try if you can install a virtual machine with it. You could also visit this link (it is for parallels, but maybe it will also work with virtual box): http://kb.parallels.com/en/118806\n\nA: You should be able to see the yosemite installer in the AppStore.

(4 GB would be just enough, the more the faster).\nLook up your model and get it if it is not MacBook Air. (no upgrade for MacBook Air).\nYou are correct, there is no formatting, but to speed up the hard drive, use Disk utility to do so.\nGetting it back to factory settings would mean to erase all data and do a fresh instal--usually not necessary since you can refresh the operating system online (Internet) using the cmd+r during start up.\n\nA: Before reseting everything, you should check to see if your friend has Speech Recognition enabled. If so, it could be eating up 1 GB of RAM!\nWhy does speech recognition take up 1 GM or RAM suddenly? And GMail in Safari 738 MB?\n\nA: 2 GB of RAM is really low for OS X Yosemite. Though Apple says it is OK, I wouldn't do Yosemite unless my Mac had at least 4 GB. My iMac actually has 8 GB.\nAnyways, if you still want to go ahead fixing Yosemite, try applying some of the fixes given in this link here. Some are pretty solid. http://machmachines.com/mac-slow-yosemite-update-fix/\n", "Q: Open file from the Dock using a non-default app Is it possible to open a file from the Dock using a non-default app?\nFor example, I prefer most .pdf files to open in Preview (thus it is my default), but some need to be opened in Adobe Reader. Is there a key combination shortcut (for example) to bring up the \"Open With\" list when opening the file from the Dock?\nI would prefer not to have to go to the folder in Finder...\n\nA: In Yosemite, I can open a file with any application in the Dock by dragging the file's icon over the application while holding the command and option keys down.\nThis only works if the targeted application is indeed able to open the file, of course.\nAnother option, when the application is not currently in your Dock, is to click the file with the right mouse button and choose an application from the submenu Open with, which is the second item in the context menu. This submenu lists the applications that can open the file you clicked on, with the default one at the top.\n", "Q: Preview- move to Trash When opening multiple .jpg files (or other format) I can use the \"Move to Trash\" on all but the last one standing?\nHere is a example of two images, and if I select one then the Move to Trash works.\n\nHowever if I select all or have only one image showing the Move to Trash is disabled?\n\nMy challenge is that I open a group of screen shots and then review and delete.\nLet say I have 50 screen shots and I open 10 of them to work with.

This \"feature\" was introduced in Lion, and you're not the first person to lament it's inclusion online. \nThe only useful solution I've found is to create an Apple Script Application that deletes any item dragged on to it and put this application in your dock. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Script Editor (inside the Applications->Utilities folder) and create a new document\n\n*Paste in the following code:\non open thisfile\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        delete file thisfile\n    end tell\nend open\n\n\n*Choose File-> Export to export your newly created application, give it a name that's useful like delete.app and save it into your applications folder. Make sure to change file format to \"Application\"\n\n*Drag the application into your dock\n\n\nVoila! Any file you drag onto this application will now be moved to trash. The last item open will still in fact stay open in preview once you delete it but it will have moved to the trash from it's previous location. It's not an ideal solution, but it's a solution. \n\nA: If your Preview.app has been made scriptable. (If I remember right Apple may have made it so in later versions, but with no real dictionary)\nYou can run this Script, Saved in an Run Applescript Action in an Automator Service for Preview.app, no input.\nset theDocs to path of (documents of application \"Preview\")\nrepeat with i from 1 to number of items in theDocs\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set item i of theDocs to ((item i of theDocs) as POSIX file) as alias\n\nend repeat\ntell application \"Finder\" to delete items of theDocs\n\nI am still looking at improving this as it works well. But it will get ALL open documents. Which each image grouped or not is seen as.\nSo beware that if you have Preview.app to open in groups or separate windows and more than one window open ALL will be seen and deleted.\nPreview.app does not respect the normal understanding of a window.\nHence me still working on this \n\nUPDATE:\nThis (in most cases) should work better. It tries to deal only with the front window and its images.\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    set theDocsID to id of window 1\n    set theDocsWin to name of (first window whose id is theDocsID)\n    try\n        set documentCount to word -5 of theDocsWin as number -- the window name has a document count. we can use this repeat for each image.\n\n    on error\n        set documentCount to 1\n    end try\n\n    repeat documentCount times\n        set theDocsPath to path of document of (first window whose id is theDocsID) --the name changes when an image is closed, but the main windows id stays the same.\n        log theDocsPath\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set theDoc to (theDocsPath as POSIX file) as alias\n        tell application \"Finder\" to delete theDoc\n        close (first window whose id is theDocsID)\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\nPlace this like before in an Automator service.\n\n\n\n*\n\nSome background on why this approach:\nEach image grouped or single image in a Preview.app's window are seen by preview as a window in  and of them selves. And the Actual image as a document.\nFor example you have two images in grouped in one Preview window.\n\nBut what Preview.app sees is:\nTwo windows with a document each.\nAnd the frontmost window will always be a the select documents window.\nWhat we see as the main window knows nothing about the windows inside of it.\nThis means you cannot use documents of window 1 etc. in the normal way.\nBecause if you have a grouped window you will only ever get the selected image in the group.\n\n*\n\nA: The other solution to this problem (personally I prefer the script app in the other answer I gave, but in case that doesn't suit for whatever reason) is to download Xee - an alternative to the preview.app that still allows you to move all items to the trash.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I have found another solution that might be of interest.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a \"Trash folder\" on your desktop that is symbolically linked to the actual Trash directory.  (Follow the directions at http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/29/add-a-trash-icon-to-the-desktop/ to see how it's done.)\n\n*Inside Preview.app, click on the filename in the title bar and click on the directory name popup in the \"Where:\" field.  Scroll down to \"Other...\" and navigate to your Trash folder.\n\n\nSome things that you might expect to streamline this, but strangely don't seem to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*After doing this a few times, you will notice that the Trash folder does not show up in the list of \"Recent Places\" at the bottom of the directory popup.\n\n*You might also think you can streamline this by adding the Trash folder to the \"Favorites\" area of your Finder sidebar, and indeed you can -- but it still doesn't show up in the directory list when you are inside of Preview.app.\n\n", "Q: Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing WIndows(Bootcamp). OSX Partition wont boot I tried to install Windows 8 into my Mac via Bootcamp. I booted into the Windows 8 Installer and had issues formatting the drive that I partitioned for the OS.\nLike an idiot, I deleted all of the partitions on my hard drive, except my main OSX partition. I believe the partitions I deleted were 600MB, 3MB, 1GB(Not sure if they were this large). But im certain I deleted one that was 600MB. \nAfter exiting out of the Windows installer, I booted up  my Mac again only see the Windows partition as an option. When I go into recovery mode, I see the partition still there, but I cant really interact with it. Does anyone know what I need to do to make my OSX partition bootable again? I went into DU(Recovery Mode) and tried mounting through DU but nothing happens.\n\nThe image shows my \"diskutil list\" output. My OSX partition is disk0s1. I am stuck and don’t want to lose my data/am trying to boot into my machine again.\n\nA: The snap shot of the distutil output helps, but I would have also included the output from the commands:\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\nEither command would give me the exact start and size of disk0s1. I have read that the EFI partition is not necessary  to boot to OS X. My recovery flash drive does not have an EFI partition and I can boot using it. To create the image you posted, you had to boot your computer and that image does not show a EFI partition either. \nThe image shows me two things wrong. First, you are suppose to have a GPT partition scheme and what is shown is MBR. (Yes, I know, the letters MBR do not appear in the picture.) Second, the \"0xAC\" appears where there should be either \"0xAF\" or \"Apple_HFS\". This means you probably have a Core Storage partition. I assume you have installed Yosemite.\nAssuming your partition is still intact and is a Core Storage partition, then do the following. \nFirst: Run the above commands to get the start and size of the slice. Post something, if you can not understand the output.\nSecond: Reset the partition scheme back to GPT. Enter the commands:\nsudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0    \nsudo gpt create -f /dev/disk0\n\nThird: Restore the desired partition. Assume start and size represent the integers from the first step, enter the commands:\nsudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0    \nsudo gpt add -b start -s size -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nAt this point, you should be able to enter the ls command to see a directory listing. If not, check the disk utility to see if the partition is mounted.\nFourth, try to boot the computer. You may need to hold down the option key at startup. \nIf you can access the partition and even boot the computer, you are not out of the woods yet. You will probably need to backup your stuff and reload the computer from scratch. Yes, reloading can be avoided, but that is the subject for a different question.\nAlso, you probably want to change the Core Storage partition back to HFS+. See if you can get the computer to boot, then we can address this problem. \n", "Q: Complete mess with iMessages and SMS messages and different devices.....help I wonder if anyone on this amazing site can help. I have an iphone (have had for years). Recently it went automatically to 'blue' imessages as default.  This caused problems as it requires me or the receiver to be in wifi range for messages to be delivered, so I disabled it on my phone. So now all my messages sent are GREEN sms messages via the mobile telephony system (i.e. normal). These are free to me as included in my monthly contract.\nNow the challenge - I think that OTHERS' phones are defaulting to iMessage when sending to me, but obviously not arriving with me as I have disabled iMessages.  Instead, it looks to them that the message has been sent to my phone - but the message then delivered to my iPad (which largely resides with my daughter now) as this has iMessage.  \nSo the problem is this: how can I keep iMessage on my iPad (which could be useful sometimes) and NOT deregister my phone number with AppleID (as it may be useful somtimes when travelling to turn iMessagess back on) BUT make any attempt to send me a message to my telephone number go via SMS telephony rather than iMessage. The only solutions I can see would require them to turn off 'iMessage' default, but that is not do-able. At the moment, both sides (them, sending messages which look like they have been safely sent, and me, scratching my head about the lack of response to my SMS texts to some friends) are left in the dark.  It's not even as if the sender realises it hasn't arrived - the message simply goes to my iPad instead.\nAs I see it, at the moment, Apple has behaved very badly indeed in making the old system incompatible with the new one they are trying to establish, and making it impossible to set a 'first try iMessage then do SMS if there is a contract and the message has not gone to the phone number via Wifi'condition.  They are essentially making life difficult for people to move from iPhones, but in this case I even have an iPhone and simply want others to be able to text me in a way which gets through. \nAny ideas? Is anyone else affected by this?\n\nA: Use this apple self help tool to de-register your phone number from iMessage.  At that point Imessage will still work with an email address.  But you can't have it both ways, the problem you are encountering is that other phones ask the apple server if you are reachable by iMessage and if you are thats how the messages are routed.\nYou didn't ask, but you shouldn't need WIFI for iMessage to work correctly.  If it does not then likely you have changed carriers and kept the same number.  If that is the case, log out of iMessage on all devices, de-register the number with the above tool, and then re-log in, letting your number get registered.\n\nA: Thanks for this - I have now realised that the SMS does deliver the messages to iMessage even when out of wifi range. In fact, this makes it even more confusing. I am far from the only person - lots of my friends are also tearing their hair out as messages seem to 'dissapear'. \nIt seems strange that the phone only allows you to do a universal 'off' for iMessages rather than register a particular person as 'non-iMessage'. Apple's iMessage is obviously great in certain circumstances, but as I've found out when you have more than one registered product, then it will simply deliver to the nearest product and consider the job done, even when it was in response to a message via an sms phone.  The potential for confusion is great, and not highlighted by Apple when you give them your number. \nFurther research, as you have suggested, seems to show that the only way around this is to remove my phone number from my apple ID - and then re-enter it again when abroad if I want to have free messaging via the internet if I'm in a wifi zone at that point.  jeez.  I feel I have fallen into a rabbit hole of unexpected complexity - I can see that Apple is assuming that at some point the entire population will have apple phones, but in fact this issue has made me more suspicious of buying other apple devices as I don't want to be 'automatically' bundled up in such an inconvenient and potentially confusing way.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes 12.1 keep deleting podcasts I've downloaded but not listened to? I have had this happen many times in the past few months. I spend quite a bit of time downloading all the episodes of a podcast so I can listen to them in my own time. Then when I refresh my podcast list to download my daily podcasts all of a sudden it will refresh and all my downloaded podcasts will disappear! It's very frustrating. Is there a way to get back the episodes I've \"lost\" and how can I stop it from happening again?\n\nA: Go to myPodcasts in iTunes\nChoose a podcast series (i.e. in the left hand column)\nChoose Settings (in lower right hand corner)\nCheck the On This computer settings. Limit Episodes needs to be set to off\n\n\nA: I don't know for sure because I'm struggling to get iTunes 12.1 to behave in anything resembling a consistent way myself, but I wonder if your issue is to do with iCloud syncing?\nI had several podcast subscriptions wiped out - along with all their episodes - on desktop because the same subscriptions weren't also in the cloud.  iCloud sync of podcasts subscriptions seems to be fundamentally broken so my recommendation would be turn it off altogether if you haven't already.\n\nSorry, but no idea how to get the episodes back, other than re-downloading them (unreliable - they might not still be available) or restoring from backups...\nAlternatively, it could be as simple as you have something other than \"Off\" selected for the limit episodes setting for the podcasts in question and/or the defaults, but I imagine you've already checked that.\n", "Q: How do you install the Facebook app on the first generation iPad? I tried to download and install the Facebook app on a first generation iPad and I get popup saying: \"this application requires iOS 7.0 or later\".\nHow do I get this app on to my iPad?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't. The 1st gen iPad maxes out at iOS 5.1.1, and the Facebook app requires iOS 7 or better. Your only option is to go to the Facebook site through a web browser such as Safari.\n", "Q: How can I keep the same desktop arrangement on two different multi-monitor setups? My machine is a late 2012 rMBP which happily powers two displays at home and two different displays at my office in what is essentially the same arrangement. My laptop is on the right with the two additional displays to the left. I consistently plug the same monitors into the same ports.\nThe problem that I always have is the desktops appear on different monitors depending on my location. Example:\nAt home, I open Google Chrome and put it in full screen mode on my leftmost display. I open iTerm and put it in full screen on my middle display. I open Mail and put it in full screen mode on my laptop display.\nNow I disconnect the monitors and go to the office. I plug in my office monitors to the same ports in the same order, and Mail is on my leftmost display while the Chrome browser appears on my laptop monitor. What the heck? So I go to expose mode or whatever its called and switch them around. No big deal, right?\nWell, in reality I have about 5x that many programs open at any given time and I always want them to appear on the same displays. I never want Chrome on the tiny laptop display and I never want Mail on the enormous leftmost display. After two years of dragging windows back and forth twice a day it has become the most infuriating thing in my life! (pretty good life, no doubt)\nIs there any way to save the desktop arrangements so that they consistently display on the desired monitor? Ideally, any monitor plugged into the same display port would display a specific desktop.\n\nA: I have a similar setup and now that I'm thinking about this, using Spaces is the key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Mission Control\n\n*Enable \"Displays have separate spaces\"\n\n*In the Dock, right-click (or option-click) an app.\n\n*Under Options, assign that app to the appropriate space and display.\n\n\nI'm currently at home where I only have a single external monitor but it is working. \nApps assigned to the monitor are on the monitor. I unplug it and the apps all go on the laptop. When I plug the monitor back in again, regardless of port, they appear on the external monitor.\n\nA: I feel your pain as I had an almost identical issue.  It went on for ever, no one knew how to fix it.  I tried re-wiring the order of displays and just about everything I could think of.\nI'm now running on Yosemite.. Shortly after upgrading apple released a firmware update (I believe Dec 19th or so) for the ThunderBolt displays.\nYosemite, along with that update - I have had no problems since. \n\nA: I can't test your setup so I can't help with this esoteric bug but I do know of an app that may help. Check out Moom. It's primarily a window-snapper utility, but it has a unique feature in which you can setup window layout snapshots based on the currently available windows. \nHere's the kicker: you can set the pre-defined window layout to trigger automatically when switching to a different number of displays.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Display Maid seems to be designed to do this:\n\nDisplay Maid is an app for keeping your displays tidy and managing your workspaces. If you use an Apple laptop with an external monitor you probably know how frustrating it is trying to keep apps and windows organized when you have to unplug your display. Everything gets jumbled up on your main screen and when you plug your display back in you have to manually move all of your windows back over to your external display. Display Maid will save and restore your window positions so you don't have to waste valuable time managing your window positions.\n\nIt is $5 (USD) on the Mac App Store but there is a free demo available (.zip file) from the developer’s website.\n", "Q: iPhone AppStore always asks for password when redeeming Basically what the title says; when I'm redeeming a code in the AppStore, there's no option for me to authenticate via TouchID, it always asks me for my Apple ID password. Am I missing something?\nIt's not really a HUGE deal, just a little annoying. Also curious that Apple lets you use TouchID for PAYMENTS but not when redeeming codes.\n\nA: This is by design. The prompt to enter your password shows you the Apple ID that you are using and for people that use more than one ID - it's quite helpful to prevent inadvertent redemption of money. I agree for some people it would be easier to just use the fingerprint, but I've seen cases where $100 gift cards went to the wrong account and it was a hassle to correct it.\n", "Q: Quicktime file not emailing from mac to PC correctly? Someone is trying to email me a Quicktime file from their Mac to my Windows PC.   (This is audio for a presentation.)   They swear that the file contains audio and video on their end, but when I get it, the file is only 14KB in size and plays as 25 seconds of blank screen and silent audio.   The Properties in the QT player show that the file should be 67MB.   \nDoes anyone know what the problem is here?   If the file is too huge, I would expect that nothing would transfer - instead I'm getting this weird 14KB \"audio.mov\" file.   He's tried it twice - I even sent the 14KB file back to him and he insists it plays fine.  \nI'm mystified - I don't want to press the person doing this for me too hard, because they're doing me a favor (an unpaid favor at that) and I would like this to be as easy as possible on them.    But if anybody knows \"oh, the problem is ______\" and how to fix it, that would be great.\nUPDATE:  We also tried transferring the file over Dropbox, but I got the same 14KB file  as before.  \n\nA: There are 2 applications on Mac called Quick Time Player.\nOne is the Quick Time player (without the 7), \nThe other is the Quick Time Player 7.This one is only basic and can be upgraded to Pro version at cost.\nYou should be using the QT player (without the 7) to send file via email.\nTo do that open the file in QT player and click on File - Sharing - Email.\nIf the file is to big to be sent by email use Dropbox then upload the file there (as you have done already), but make sure you are uploading the correct file. If it is audio it will be at least 5 meg or more (certainly not 14k).\n", "Q: Synology LDAP and OSX Network Homes Is there anyone out there using a Synology DiskStation running Directory Server (their LDAP implementation) to provide authentication AND network homes for OSX?  I've tried setting it up and have hit a roadblock with getting the OSX clients to automount the NFS export where the home folders reside on Synology.  I would love to know if anyone out there is doing this and how they configured the clients to automount the homes.  \n\nA: Have you tried mounting the volumes and then adding them to their LogIn items?\nI have my iTunes library on my Synology and use that to get the volume mounted every time I restart (which is only for system updates that need restarting.)\n", "Q: Little Snitch reports outgoing connections from Mach Kernel -- am I infected? I monitor all my traffic using Little Snitch.  Recently, I've noticed strange IP addresses making connections to the \"mach_kernel\" process.  Most of these IP addresses seem to originate from other programs (for example, I might see a Google address connected to mach_kernel when I'm browsing Gmail via my browser).  \nIs my Mac infected?  The main concern here is that I have a virus which is MitMing traffic of other programs on my box.  How can I tell if this is the case?\n\nA: I have asked the Little Snitch development team at obdev about this issue. Here is the response:\n\nIn fact local traffic over AFP or SMB protocol is routed by the mach_kernel process on newer OS X systems.\nIt is defined as /mach_kernel on 10.10.x.\n  I'm on OS X 10.11.4 here, where the process path is now /System/Library/Kernels/kernel\nUnfortunately it can not be treated the same way as other processes, but usually your local network rules should cover all relevant connections for it.\nBut I have to admit that I also remember a case where external connections are associated with the mach_kernel by mistake and it seems to happen when the tables in the Little Snitch Network Monitor cache got mixed somehow.\n  Do you perhaps experience such external connections associated with the mach_kernel process?\n  Possibly thats an issue of memory - happening when your system (including the Little Snitch Network Monitor) is up running for quite some time… I already talked to our developers about that and we will keep an eye on that issue.\n...\nSimon\n\n\"the tables in Little Snitch Network Monitor cache got mixed somehow\"? Seriously?\nIt does indeed seem to happen after my machine has been running for days or weeks without reboot. And a reboot will fix it temporarily. It is possible that this is simply a bug in Little Snitch.\nHowever, I find it dubious that traffic routed over mach_kernel \"cannot be treated the same way as other processes\". I am not informed about how Little Snitch is architected. It may not be able to run in kernel space (ring 0), but I find it terribly convenient in today's climate of mass government spying that the OSX kernel can simply take over and get around Little Snitch. I believe IPTables would have no such trouble in blocking traffic, but it is most certainly of a different architecture and user model altogether.\nSee here for additional reference: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/58815/do-firewalls-always-run-in-userspace\nSwitching to FOSS/Linux is looking more and more like the path to be on.\n", "Q: Deleted Files from my IPhone still shows up when I hook my phone to Itunes I deleted Music and Video from my Iphone 5, 8.1.2; But whenever I hook it up to the PC it still shows the deleted files as ghost datas under \"On my device\", furthermore Itunes says that my device has 6.05gb free space but my Iphone says 8.00gb free space.

I am getting notice while adding my debit card that your payment method was declined app store.\nI used my Debit card because it has zero balance to add purpose only.\nBut app store is saying that payment is declined.\nSo it means Apple will charge without asking me?\nHow much will Apple charge and Will that amount be refunded or not, if refunded after what time?\n\nA: Companies can reserve an amount of money on a credit or debit card without actually charging it, to ensure that you can charge the card later when they need to. This is called an Authorization request to your credit card. \nI expect that Apple are reserving a small amount of money when you register a card, and then releasing the reservation immediately, to make sure that the card is valid.\nThat might reduce your available credit by a small amount for a few days, if your card provider has bad IT systems, but it won't actually charge your account.\nThis is a standard practice that many companies explain in either their FAQS or T&C's.\nFrom the BBCshop faq.\n\nI have been charged for my order but it hasn't been despatched\nPlease be assured that here at the BBC Online Shop we do not charge\n  your credit or debit card until your order has been despatched from\n  our warehouse. \nWe send what is called an authorization request to your credit card\n  company. Your credit card company verifies that the card is valid and\n  that the amount of your transaction is available. If the card number\n  is valid and the funds are available, they put an authorization hold\n  on the funds. An authorization is only a hold on the funds for a\n  possible future transfer. This hold is temporary, and if the\n  transaction isn't settled it will expire without any action. It is not\n  a completed transaction and no funds are transferred at that time. \nYour credit card company may still show a temporary authorization hold\n  on the funds after your transaction is completed. It can take several\n  working days for them to process the void on the authorization. The\n  time will vary from one company to the next. Unfortunately, many\n  customer service people at the card companies don't understand the\n  difference between a settled transaction and an authorization hold.\n  They will tell you that it was a valid transaction.\n\nBarns & Noble FAQ.\n\nAre there any differences in paying with a credit card versus a debit card?\nThe main difference is that most credit card companies first authorize\n  a customer's card when an order is placed, then actually charge the\n  account when the item is provided -- in our case, at the time we ship\n  your order. The only exception to this is digital purchases such as\n  NOOK Books, NOOK Newspapers, NOOK Magazines, and NOOK Apps—for these\n  items, the credit card account is charged immediately.\nMost debit cards reserve funds from a customer's bank account at the\n  time of the original transaction. That amount, therefore, is\n  unavailable to you. When the order ships, the bank pays that debited\n  amount to BN.com. For digital purchases such as NOOK Books, the order\n  amount is immediately debited from the customer's bank account.\n\n", "Q: Process Flow Diagams - Chemical Engineering Can anyone suggest software for making Process Flow diagrams on Mac OS alike the ones available for Windows like Ansys? \n\nA: I would recommend Omnigraffle for any diagrams.

In your case, you could have had contacts stored in 3 different locations: 1) locally on your iPhone, 2) in iCloud,, 3) on Exchange server.\nTo ensure that your contacts are actually in exchange, use Exchange Web Access to check that the contacts in question are actually on the Exchange server.\nThen, on your iPhone, go to \"Contacts\" app > \"Groups\" > and make sure that your Exchange account is enabled for display.\nIt is sometimes helpful to disable all server-based accounts in \"Groups\" to see what contacts are actually stored locally on the phone.

I would like to be able to view this calendar from my work Outlook account. Is there some way to share the calendar with non-Apple calendar applications?\n\nA: First, I am assuming by \"Outlook\" you mean the Outlook email client application and not an @outlook.com email account. In other words, your work computer uses the Exchange/Outlook system for emails, calendar, and so on.\nIf so - and assuming your IT department would permit this - you could try the iCloud Control Panel on your work computer.

So far I did a 7x disk erase and reinstalled OS X. In addition I cleared the NVRAM and the SMC. Is there any other possible system settings I can reset besides cleaning the disk, reinstalling OS X, clearing the NVRAM, and clearing the SMC?\n\nA: That's about as much as needs to be done (and indeed can be done) other than removing and destroying your old drive for security purposes.\nHaving said that, without specialist forensic equipment the chances of recovering data from a drive that's had a single zero-fill erase is essentially zero, and is pretty much beyond the scope of consumer-level data recovery software. The excruciatingly-long 7 and 35-pass erase routines are overkill for for most people not featuring highly on the NSA's watch list. If platters were removed from the drive and read directly by specialist equipment then limited recovery is possible, but you'd have to be a really interesting person for anyone to go to such lengths.\n", "Q: Xcode: TAB key for indenting selection I hope that somebody here can suggest me a way to make the TAB key indent a text selection (i.e., could be multi-line and not just one line) in Xcode.\nIn Xcode preferences, I set TAB as the shortcut for the \"Shift right\" function but it does not work: instead of indenting, it deletes the text.\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nA: You can use BetterTouchTool to rebind TAB ⇥ key to ⌘ CMD+] only for Xcode.app. BetterTouchTool can be downloaded here.

My iPod touch 5th generation has VoiceOver enabled and is not letting me into my home screen. Triple-pressing the home button doesn't work. How can I unlock my device?\n\nA: The main UX change you need to be aware of with VoiceOver enabled is that a single tap selects an element and a double-tap anywhere on the screen will cause a simulated tap on the element which is currently selected. This means that you need to tap once on what you want to select, then double-tap anywhere.\nSelect Slide to Unlock, then double-tap.

When I use my Apple TV for Netflix, Youtube, NHL, etc it all works just fine.  When I try to rent a movie from Apple (iTunes) it has a black screen, the message \"Could Not Sign In\" and an okay button and that is it.\nI have full connection to my WiFi according to the my network info in the General tab.  The only answers I have found is to use a micro-HDMI cable but this appleTV doesn't have that.  It only has an Ethernet, Optical, and HDMI ports. I have not tried to hard wire it as the TV is on the other side of the house from the router and that is how I want to use it.\nAnyone have any ideas before I try to use this as a skipping stone across my pond?\n\nA: Use your Computer and log in in to iTunes with it.\nThen just leave it logged in.\nNow try again with your Apple TV.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it wasn't solved by resetting or restoring Apple TV from the box or via iTunes (after attaching the TV box to my computer). Turning box and/router on and off didn't work either. But I did solve the problem in the end. Download the Apple TV remote app from the App Store; follow the instructions in the app to connect your phone to your Apple TV as a remote; then sign in to iTunes via the phone app instead of the original remote (much easier anyway as you can type your Apple ID and password) and it lets you in. At least it did me. Phew, I can now access all my purchased content again.

After I changed my AppleID, I struggled and struggled to sign in to the iTunes store on my apple TV.  What finally worked for me was downloading the Apple TV remote app, and then discovering that I couldn't \"see\" my appleTV because it wasn't on the same wireless connection.  Long story short, I unplugged the ethernet cable from the apple TV (making it wireless), and tried again, using the iPhone apple TV remote, which worked great, and I was able to sign in.  Hallelujah!  I plugged the ethernet cable back in, and I am in business.\n\nA: I have an apple tv v3, and same issue.

Its like there is no record of the photos ever being uploaded except for a blank event in iPhoto events where the photos were originally uploaded and I could view them. Not all photos are missing only the most recent upload. I do not have time machine backups, so can't use this method to recover files, as I have just purchased a new macbook pro and haven't got round to setting up time machine yet (I should have known better). I tried using a 3rd party data scan software package and the software can locate the missing photos! however it will charge me to recover these photos. I don't feel I should pay for a 3rd party solution, because if a 3rd party data recovery package can identify the missing photos, why can't my mac os? has anyone experienced this problem? and are there any data recovery options I have overlooked to restore the photos without using a 3rd party software package?\n\nA: The 3rd party software may scan the raw data for photo files and identify them by whatever signature it may find (JPEG or other). Mac OS X doesn't come with that feature since it naturally assumes the file system will work correctly and it does everything thru the file system. Data recovery software just isn't a standard feature of an operating system.\nPhotoRec is a well-known multi-platform software that would probably be able to help in your case and is free/open source if you want to try that. http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec\n\"PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.\"\nBe aware, the more you write data to your hard drive, the more chance the underlying data that might be recoverable will be destroyed by overwriting. The best way to do it would be by removing the hard drive and using it as a secondary drive to another computer that's running PhotoRec to completely minimize the chance of overwrite damage.\n", "Q: I want know how to get the new photo filters in the camera on my iPhone 4 I want to know how to get the new photo filters in the camera on my iPhone 4 because my friend has them on her iPhone 4s. How do I get them?\n\nA: I think the filters you are talking about were added with iOS 8, the recent iPhone operating system update. Unfortunately that update won't install on your iPhone 4.\nThere are a number of applications available in the App Store that provide similar photo filters though.\n", "Q: Can I copy files between 2 different iTunes libraries within iTunes? I want to create 2 iTunes libraries on my Windows 7 PC so that my wife and I can separate our music and more easily sync to different iPods.  However, we also want to be able to share some of the music between the 2 libraries.\nFirst question: Is the current default iTunes library folder located at \\Libraries\\Music\\iTunes?\nQuestion 2: If I allow iTunes to create duplicates of all the music from the original library in the new library, will I then have 2 physical copies of all music files on my hard drive?\nQuestion 3: Based on what I have read so far, it appears that the only way to copy music from one library to another is by exporting from one library to an external location and then importing into the other directory from that external location.  Is this correct?  If not, please clarify.\n\nA: Direct answers to your questions…\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes - though that's it's 'masked' address not it's actual location.\nReal location is C:\\Users\\[myName]\\Music\\\n\n*Yes.\n\n*You can dupe the library.xml file & change the hard-coded paths to the new location, then import.\nSimple, but time-consuming.\n\n\nAnother downside to that method is that once you have separated the identities in such a way, they will remain forever separate & any music added to one will also need to be added to the other.\nYou will also have to remember to launch with the correct Library every time.\nHowever…\nInstead, if you use 'Sync selected playlists, artists, albums & genres you can have completely different selections for each device, even on the same ID.\nI have totally different selections on my iPhone & iPod, as I use them for different things.\nMight be a whole lot easier to manage.\n\n"]
