["Q: Upgrade from 10.9.5 to 10.10.* without App Store I can't open the App Store, and I can't open software update. I've tried all the troubleshooting advice I can find online, but none of it solved my problem, so I figured an OS update was overdue. I'm hoping that will fix it. \nI can't seem to update without the app store, though!\nI ran sudo softwareupdate --install —all and restarted (sudo shutdown -r now), but \"About this Mac\" still tells me I'm on 10.9.5. (Again, clicking the \"Software Update\" button tries to launch software update, but fails.)\nNow, when I run sudo softwareupdate —list it says, \"No new software available.\" \nIs there anything else I can try before I have to take it to the Mac store?\n\nA: Get someone to download the installer from the App Store - just download it, don't install.\nApple documents how to create a bootable installer - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 using any USB drive or even an SD card should your Mac have that slot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug that device in to your Mac.\n\n*Remember to hold down the option key when your Mac starts up.  \n\n*Select the device.\n\n\nOne last thing, make sure you check your backup before installing. Time Machine is best. The upgrade isn't designed to have problems, but you never know.\n\nA: I'd really consider trying to fix the existing OS long before exacerbating the situation by trying to force another over it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Start with Disk Utility - Repair Disk Permissions & Verify Disk [startup from the Recovery partition,  Cmd ⌘   R  at the startup chime, if the Disk needs Repairing]. \n\n*Again from the recovery partition, reset home folder permissions & ACLs, as per this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163449/85275 \n\n\n*\n\n*Steps 1 & 2 can instead be performed using the freeware Onyx utility…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Run the latest combo updater for 10.9.5 - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760\n", "Q: Can I reset app windows to default size/position? I was just wondering if there is a way to reset app windows like Mail or Finder to there default size and position. Is this possible and so yes, how?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Window size preferences are generally stored in the .plist files found in\n/HD/Users/YourName/Library/Preferences\nYou may need to enable hidden files by using: \ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES  in command line, followed by a relaunch of Finder.\nAs an example, for Finder the file is called com.apple.finder.plist and the window state information is under the key WindowState for each different type of finder window (e.g. standard folder, searchview...) Other applications have similar naming (ctrl+F is your friend here!), e.g. the Fontbook app uses the NSWindowFrame key. \nYou should be able to safely remove the window state information as it get auto read from defaults database anyway.\n\nHaving said all that, this doesn't appear to work for a few applications such as Maps and Mail (which is what you want unfortunately). But hey, it's a start.\n(Also apologies for the lack of codeblocks, they are refusing to show up for some reason)\n", "Q: Slow OSX booting with black screen before apple logo Every time I boot my macbook, there is always a black screen before the Apple Logo pops up. The blackscreen stays for around 15-20 seconds. How can I resolve that problem?\n\nA: It can happen, if you doesn't have selected a specific start-volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu choose System Preferences.\n\n*Click the Startup Disk icon in System Preferences, or choose View > Startup Disk.\n\n*Select your startup disk from the list of available volumes.\n\n\nAfter that, restart your mac and the blackscreen shouldn't appear before a start.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 10.10.4 does not complete, ask to restart endlessly On a Macbook Air laptop, on 10.10.3, I'm trying to upgrade to 10.10.4.\nThe first time, the system downloaded the file. After the download, I had a message saying (I'm translating form french): \"download of some updates did not finish; they can't be installed\".\nSince then, the system update shows with the \"update\" button, but the system does not redownload the file, I see a notification saying the system will reboot, but actually it will display the above error message.\nHow can I force the upgrade?\n\nA: This should be easy to resolve.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power down and boot into Recovery HD (Command R) or safe boot (shift)\n\n*Once you know the OS can boot itself - check for free space. Clean up cache or temporary files or delete large databases that you have backed up (Outlook email, Photo databases, Music Libraries) to get 20 GB of free space.\n\n*Run Disk Utility to ensure the disk structure doesn't need repair\n\n*Download the combo updater from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1820?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\n*Run the update by hand and when the installer is running, open the log to watch for errors (Command L and then Command 3) if you desire or can see the log.\n\n", "Q: Google Calendar - iPad compatibility I'm trying to install Google Calendar app on my IPad Air 2.\nCouldn't find it in App Store on my IPad. So I found it on a web page\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar/id909319292?mt=8\nthen I sent this link to my IPad and App Store installed it on IPad but...\nIt was installed like for IPhone, everything was big and huge so i had to remove it.\nIt looks like there's no Google Calendar app for IPad. Am I right?\nHow to install Google Calendar on IPad?\n\nA: There's no separate iPad version, no.\nThe iTunes Store Page you linked says compatible with iPad, but optimised for iPhone.\nThat's likely to mean it works, but won't look great.\n\n", "Q: How can I encrypt my home folder? I have a Macbook with several user accounts. Most of the accounts have administrator privileges. The computer's hard disk is encrypted using FileVault.\nIs there a way to additionally encrypt each users' home directory so as to prevent other admin users from accessing the others' directories?\nI'm (always) running the newest OS X (10.10.4 at the time of writing).\n\nA: Encrypting the entire user folder will break OS X 10.10 since certain user processes get started before you log in.\nYou might have to re-evaluate your security levels for users if you can't trust administrators to not abuse their power. FileVault only protects you against non-users. Admin users are root and you can only hope they a) don't know that or b) refrain from bad behavior.\nLook at a MDM solution like Casper from JAMF. It has a self-service tool that allows app updates and limited administrative tasks without needing end users to be admin. All users can easily be normal users whether you make tools to do the limited things they need or purchase a tool that has those policies already created.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2008 won't boot after error message asking to shut down due to low battery Yesterday my Macbook Air (original), model: a1237 flashed an error message\nasking the user to shutdown due to low battery. Since it was not me, but my brother who was operating the macbook at that time, that I am not able to exactly put here what the error message was. \nBut, as I was told later, it prompted him to shutdown.\nAfter that event, the Macbook when completely dead!

(Observing whether the charge LED goes green or orange is an important clue to the health of the SMC/logic board and battery)\n\n*Reset the NVRAM and try a boot with the option key held down listening for the blower to start up\n\n*Charge for 10 minutes\n\n*Reset the SMC again\n\n*Now that things you can do externally are basically exhausted, now they would open the Mac case and proceed with observation/testing - perhaps with disconnect the battery and test charging and boot again\n\n", "Q: OS X Photos removes 5 photos when converting to iCloud Photos When I try to convert my local Photos.app library to iCloud, the amount of photos in the library decreases from 686 to 681. I have tried to convert my local library multiple times but the problem keeps happening. I have found one of those 5 photos, but the file doesn't seem to be damaged.\n\n\nThe library was created in OS X 10.10.3 and I am currently running 10.10.4. Is this a bug in the app? What can I do to prevent these photos from getting deleted while enabling iCloud Photos?\n\nA: After contacting AppleCare, it seemed I had a database error. The problem was forwarded to the iCloud engineers and has now been fixed.\n", "Q: Location services on a macbook pro How can I set the location on my macbook from a GPS set when out of range of any WIFI signal (e.g. at sea)?\n\nA: You'd have to read the GPS manual & see if it has any form of mac connectivity/drivers, otherwise you'd need to buy a GPS dongle - this is just the first one I found, no doubt there are many others - http://www.amazon.com/GlobalSat-ND-100S-USB-GPS-Dongle/dp/B003WNHGAO\n\nA: The location on your Macbook uses WiFi signal. It does not work without it. In simple words, every Wifi broadcasts its identifier code (that is used to determine its location) so that is how your Mac knows where it is.\n\nWi-Fi is far more than a network connection. It's a location source.\n  Combining the Wi-Fi (BSSID) with the Signal strength, GPS, Cell\n  Towers and IP address is used to locate the position of the Wifi\n  broadcast. But due to the nature of WiFi signal it is only accurate to about 30 meters range. In addition, new technology uses the Bluetooth to pinpoint the location down to few meters.\n\nIf you plan to be out of range of WiFi (ocean) then you need a GPS hardware (USB stick) and software that goes with it.\nJust for demo purpose use this website to show your location that is based on your IP address.\n", "Q: Why isn't this alias in terminal working? The alias's objective is to launch a pdf in my chrome browser. The pdf is entitled \"Intro to Java.pdf\"; the browser is \"Google Chrome\" \nalias x='open -a \"Google Chrome\" /Users/ahanagrawal/Documents/\"Intro to Java.pdf\"'\n\nA: Are you sourcing the file in which the alias is defined?\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nIf your alias was defined in .bash_profile in your home directory.\nTo list the defined aliases, simply type 'alias' in the shell. Type 'alias youraliasname' to see whether the alias 'youraliasname' is defined, and if so, its definition.\n", "Q: Is There a Wired Mouse or Track Ball That Supports Gestures in OSX? I wanted to find out if there was a wired alternative to Apple's Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad that also supports the gestures built into OS-X Yosemite, at the very least the ones supported by a Magic Mouse.\nI realize that one alternative is just stick with the wireless Magic Mouse and go with a Mobee Magic Charger for Apple Magic Mouse, but the reviews on the Apple Store have been mixed and I was wondering if anyone is using a wired device that gives them the ability to use OS-X gestures?\nUpdate\nWell searches of all the major sites, Apple, Amazon, B&H, MacLife, MacWorld, etc. has not yielded an answer on a wired mouse or trackball that support OS-X gestures. I figured I would bump this once to see if maybe I missed something, or if there is a designer out there who wants to go in on the deal to make one. ☺︎\nThank you.\n\nA: Okay, so I found out that there is one option that kind of supports Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad gestures. \nThe Wacom Bamboo Pad allows you to control your Mac with touch gestures and comes in a wired, USB model.\nIf anyone finds another solution, please post it, because I was really looking for a wired mouse that can do this and would appreciate the input.\nThanks again,\n", "Q: Can I connect a microphone to a retina 5k iMac? My 5K retina iMac has one audio port.  On my MacBook pro that only had one port, it was possible, in System Preferences, to state whether to use it as an input or an output.\nIs it possible to use the one on the 5k iMac as an input?  It is, perhaps, some weird connector that takes a regular headset or multiple signals, two for stereo audio out and one for audio in?\nI recognize that there is a built-in microphone, and there are USB or bluetooth devices that can send in audio data, but it'd sure be handy if I can plug in an audio source as I used to (especially as I have a contact mic that goes to an instrument that I'd like to plug in.)\n\nA: It should be possible to add a microphone, you just need the correct adapter. See this answer I posted to a similar question - I believe the same will apply in this case.\n\nA: Now that I see that this question has 10k views, I thought I'd come back and provide an updated answer. I tried a funky headphone adapter (as in the other answer), but it didn't work well for me.\nUltimately, I purchased a USB audio adapter (sort of like this or this) and it has worked well. They're less than $15.\n", "Q: Email forwarding - iOS Someone sent me an email with an image attached. I want to review the image and forward it to someone else.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Using the application Mail click on your mail. Then click in the bottom bar the 4th icon that is an arrow. Press Forward. If it asks if you want to include attachments from original message, press Include. Then just fill the information depending on who do you want to send it to.\n", "Q: Error message when adding Calendar Event When adding a New Event to Calendar on the iPhone6, I get an error message \"Cannot Save Event - That event does not belong to that event store.\" How are events suppose to be added to the calendar?\n\nA: You provided very little information, like what account (iCloud, Google Calendar, etc.) you are trying to add an event to. I suggest signing out of that account in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then signing in again.\n", "Q: Keyboard does not appear when adding a new contact I cannot get a keyboard when adding a contact on my new iPhone 6.   What to I need to do?\n\nA: Keyboards on iPhone 6 are know to be buggy. My suggestions would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update to the latest iOS version which is 8.4. Do this in Settings > General > Software Update.\n\n*If you are using third-party keyboards, disable them in Settings > General > Keyboard and use the default keyboards.\n\n*Try closing the Contacts app and then restarting it. (Do this by double pressing the Home button, swiping up the Contacts app, pressing the Home button and then opening the Contacts app again.)\n\n*Restart your iPhone. (Hold down the power button on the side for a few seconds, swipe to turn off, wait for your iPhone to completely turn off (can take up to a minute) and then holding down the power button for a second or two until the Apple logo appears on the screen.)\n\n", "Q: Sniffing router traffic I have a 10 MB connection, which runs really good but sometimes it get slower then 56kb dialup connection, i had my provider call up and asked, what is wrong but they say too much traffic is being consumed in your house by devices on the chart of connected devices. So i had my password of wifi changed and just connected my laptop, and it was running really like a 10 MB connection, but again i am facing same issue. \nI want to monitor my network traffic and see what's the devices on router taking so much of my bandwidth and if possible website address too. I have a mac, i was wondering if there is any software that can really help me out?\n\nA: It's hard to comment on your question as you didn't give many details.\nYou could connect a switch with monitor/mirror port functionality between your router and your DSL modem/network terminator (if that is two discrete devices for you). This way you could connect a computer to the switch's mirror port and \"see\" (snoop, trace) all traffic that goes out your router's WAN port and analyze it.\n", "Q: A problem with the Telegram app- online status I have a problem with my device and it would be great if anyone can help me with this problem.\nIn Telegram Messenger app; when I close the App, either by closing it or by coming out from the app my \"ONLINE\" is on just temporarily. \nIf I check my status from another device in front of my name is still written ONLINE.\nIs there a way to change this On-line reporting to be more accurate.\nRegards.\n\nA: Previous versions of Telegram used to linger on changing one's status from online to last seen just now for about 5-10 minutes. (Not documented, just my observation.) But I think they've fixed this in the latest version. Please update Telegram on all your devices and check if this problem still exists.\n\nA: It depends on the other device that shows your online status, If you sync the device it will show your status online.\n", "Q: How can Finder empty Trash more quickly than \"rm -rf /Volumes/Foo/.Trashes/501/*\"? The \"Trash\" of a 16-GB usb2 flash drive had 3.4-GB of data. I emptied it as such:\n\n$ cd /Volumes/FooDrive/.Trashes/501\n$ rm -rf *\n\nThis took over 5-seconds. That seemed pretty long. So, as a test I just decided to empty the Trash of all of my drives via Finder. Other drives:\n2-TB usb3\n500-GB usb2\n16-GB usb2\n250-GB ssd\nI measured the size of the Trash as such:  \n\n$ du -ch /Volumes/WhateverDrive/.Trashes\n\nThere was 15-GB in the Trash of the 500-GB drive, and 5-GB in the Trash of my other 16-GB flash drive. I didn't measure the other drives.\nFinder appeared to take much less than 5-seconds to empty the Trash for all those drives.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Finder really empty the Trash so much more quickly than /bin/rm? How?  \n\n*Does Finder just make the \"clicking sound\" (signaling the trash is empty) before the Trash on all the drives is really empty?\n\n\nA: The time it takes to delete a file doesn't depend (much) on the size of the file. Thus, the number of files being deleted matters much more than the size of the files. My guess is that the trash on FooDrive had lots of small files, and that's what took so long.\nI just ran a quick test on my HD, with 500,000 zero-length files scattered through 1,110 directories (10 top-level directories, each containing 10 subdirectories, each containing 10 subdirectories, each containing 50 empty files). du -ch gave their total size as 0B, but find /path/to/trash -mindepth 1 | wc -l counted 501110 items. Deleting them with rm -R took 75 seconds, while the Finder took 91 seconds. The difference was mostly that the Finder took 18 seconds \"preparing\" (i.e. counting the files) before actually deleting them.\nVerdict: rm -R is slightly faster, but not enough to matter. Oh, and the Finder waited until all items were actually gone before playing its crinkle sound.\nBTW, for some types of files (e.g. applications), the Finder will show them as single files, but they're actually a hidden folder structure that can contain a large number of files. Use find /path/to/folder -mindepth 1 | wc -l to get an accurate count of items.\n", "Q: Restoring/Forwarding offline emails from Mac Mail A long time ago I started using Mac Mail instead of my web-based Yahoo email. Then I deleted all my emails from my web-based Yahoo account and kept them on Mac Mail. Now that I've stopped using Mac Mail and I'm back to using web-based Yahoo, I want to know if there's any way I can restore/forward these offline emails stored on my Mac Mail back into Yahoo. There are a lot of emails, so forwarding one by one is not an option.\nSomeone help?\nThank you!!\n\nA: Add your Yahoo! email as IMAP and upload your mail manually from the old —presumably POP— storage on your Mail.app.\nI haven't tried it myself but in recent OS X versions adding accounts is straightforward. If this is not the case and you have to configure it manually, Yahoo! offers relevant information to that effect here.\n", "Q: Mac mini hard drive recovery w/ encrypted partition My Mac mini failed recently, and after taking it to the Apple store, they said it was the logic board that failed, and it would be $350ish to replace, which was not worth it to me, so I took it back.\nI want to recover the data off of the hard drive. I have the drive removed from the computer, and plugged into my laptop running Ubuntu 15.04/Windows 7 (dual boot) via USB3.\nI have two partitions on the hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Macintosh HD Partition, and\n\n*An encrypted partition with some sensitive documents\n\n\nHow can I mount this encrypted partition on my laptop (using Ubuntu or Windows, idc), and get the data off of it (I know the password that it was encrypted with)?\n\nA: You have two problems: FileVault whole disk encryption and the HFS+ filesystem. HFS+ is not difficult to deal with in Ubuntu, but I've seen no readily accessible tools to access a FileVault encrypted volume even when you know the password.\nIt'll be far easier to use a Mac to turn off FileVault. Disk Utility can unlock and decrypt the drive. The folks at the Apple Store might let you use one of the computers in the store to decrypt the drive, otherwise you might have to borrow a friends Mac for a while. It'd be best to use the same version of OS X or newer.\n", "Q: How do I put all of the music in my iTunes library (12.2) onto my iPhone 6? Really frustrated with iTunes -- How the heck do I add the music in my iTunes library to my iPhone?\nI'm a power user and I've been using iTunes and iPods since the beginning.\nI'm going on a road trip tomorrow morning and I want to sync my iPhone 6 with my iTunes library -- just put all 15 GB of music on my iPhone so I can listen to it in the car.\nLast week I installed iTunes 12.2 and I signed up for Apple Music.\nI cannot for the life of me figure out how to sync my 15 GB iTunes library to my iPhone so I can use it like an iPod.  I don't want to stream music from Apple Music while I'm on the road, that requires the cellular network which is unreliable and also costs me tons of money in data fees.\nPlease help!!\n\nA: I am assuming that you have your 'entire Music Library' downloaded on your Mac. This seems like a simple case. \n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone into your Mac.\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Tap the iPhone icon\n\n*Under the \"Settings\" section header, click \"Music\"\n\n*Click the checkboxes \"Sync Music\" and \"Sync Entire music library\"\n\n\nA: When you use Apple Music it automatically turns on iCloud Music Library, which lets you add Apple Music tracks to your \"My Music\" playlist (enabled by Apple Music). This is similar but not completely the same to iTunes Match, so it strips the ability for you to sync your music manually.\nIf you have your existing music backed up, turn off iCloud Music Library in Settings > Music > iCloud Music Library on your iPhone. This will delete any Apple Music tracks you may have added to your My Music playlist. Then, sync your music over, and if you still want to use iCloud Music Library, turn it back on again. This is what user3439894 posted in his comment to your question.\n", "Q: Why does Disk Utility show \"Macintosh HD\" on both Logical Volume Group and the volume underneath? \nAfter performing a clean install of Yosemite (erasing the entire disk using disk utility during installation), the original name of the disk (APPLE HDD HTS547575A9E384 Media) turned out to be \"Macintosh HD\" eventually. In addition, there are only two actions left, first aid and partition.\nI have carried out clean installs several times on this MacBook Pro (13-inch, mid 2012, now running 10.10.4), but this is the first time that I encounter this kind of problem. The only thing I did was erase the entire disk. Hope to return back to its original state, showing its real name and available actions.\n\nA: Why Disk Utility does it this way is a good question, but when both the drive and volume show like this, its a CoreStorage volume.\nThese terminal commands should put it back to the old way if it isn't encrypted:\ndiskutil cs list - find the \"Logical Volume\" (not Group) and copy the long \"number\" at the end of the line (it looks like this: BE1E16CA-64E2-494B-8EDC-3E843EF5C9A9)\ndiskutil cs revert BE1E… - paste in that long string in place of BE1E…\nAs always, ensure you have a backup in case things don't work out.\n", "Q: How to customize open with menu in Yosemite? I want to customize the right click/\"open with\" menu for some file extensions like jpg, in order to see just the 4 apps i want to use with this file type. Google suggests me to edit the info.plist file of the apps (Applications/**/Contents/) by changing the CFBundleTypeExtensions section. This does not seem to work anymore in Yosemite.

As the title states, is there any danger in leaving my iMac G5 (Later 2005 model) turned off and disconnected from a power outlet for long periods of time?\nI will be traveling for roughly 1 month and, during a normal week, I only intend to use it a couple of times a week. Otherwise, it will sit in my room under a full dust cover, disconnected from a power outlet.\nIs there any risk to this? Specifically- could doing this alone damage the battery/system components/screen as it would damage a portable battery powered device such as an iPad or iPhone (where the battery must be charged and discharged at a fairly consistent rate)?\n\nA: Your machine is now 10 years old, so there's definitely the risk that your PRAM backup battery has \"worn out\" and is nearly dead now. The life expectancy for these kinds of \"coin cells\" is normally about 10 years.\nSo if you disconnect your Mac from the power supply for an \"extended time\" you risk that it fails to back up the PRAM. A battery loses its charge over time, and that's especially true for worn out batteries. The more you disconnect your Mac from the mains connection the more the backup battery has to supply the PRAM with electrical current, which in turn causes the battery to wear out even more.\nDisconnecting your Mac from the mains connection as such is not harmful for your Mac or any of its components.\nYou could have your battery replaced which should cost you about USD 100-150 (my estimation based on the effort to completely disassemble the iMac). Then leaving the iMac disconnected for a month would not be any problem at all.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get GNU sed for OSX? I have brew installed but I don't have the GNU flavor of sed - can I get it through brew? \n\nA: I know you said fsed however I could not find it anywhere so assuming it's a typo and you actually meant sed you can install it with:\nbrew install gnu-sed\n\nOr\nbrew install gnu-sed --with-default-names\n\n", "Q: Stop MS Word opening files automatically on launch Continual opening of files from history.

The application information panel on retina MacBooks features a checkbox \"Open in Low Resolution\" with you are supposed to use when you experience e.g. visual problems (according to Apple).\nBut what does this box actually do? What happens to the application, what does the window manager do differently? \n\nA: Say you have you're screen set to standard (using 15\" as an example here), then \"it looks like\" 1440x900 but it is really 2880 x 1800. Making this example easy, say the app runs in fullscreen, then it would usually load with 2880x1800. If you check the \"Open in Low Resolution\" it will load in 1440x900, thus being less sharp but in some cases better performing or preventing bugs if the app is not optimized.\n", "Q: Macbook 12 \" and Windows 8.1 I have prepared bootcamp with windows 8.1 iso.

(OS 10.10.4) Same procedure on Macbook pro 13\" shows big language setting page and keyboard works well. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I had the same problem. I was installing Win 8.1 by bootcamp on a MacBook 12\" early-2016. The internal keyboard and trackpad did not work.\nI was using the USB-C to 3 ports adater with only one standard USB. So I tried to unplug the installation flash drive and plug a usb mouse. It worked, though obviously I cannot continue to install without the flash drive. So option 1 is use a USB hub and a external mouse.\nAnother option is to install Win 10.

I just want two plane pages in full screen mode. \n\n\nA: Here is the result using Preview on 10.9.5 in full screen mode with 2 pages showing.\n\n\nA: The default Preview app that comes with OS X supports this...\nEither before or after entering fullscreen mode you can press Command 3 to enter into Two-up mode, and then use the Command + short cut to zoom in.\n", "Q: How to reset your keyboard on OS X 10.10.4 My keyboard number pad has been messed up ever since I installed OS X 10.10.4. \nThe numbers type as follows:  \nwhen I press \"1\" increase volume key goes up as well.  \nWhen I press \"2\" the ' key comes up as well.  \n\"3\" some wired key. \n\"4\" ] comes up. \n\"5\" [ comes up. \nAnd \"6\" the equals sign comes up. \nAnd vice versa for the concurrent keys. 7 and 8 as well as their shift keys work fine, 9 highlights everything in shift and goes to the beginning. \nI've tried a reinstall and a separate Bluetooth apple wireless keyboard I have seems to work fine. \nPlease help I've scoured the Internet for answers, nothing has worked.\n\nA: You would have to open up your mac and unplug the keyboard cord power up the mac and then plug it would be a hard reset\n", "Q: Does Apple take apps off the store if they crash a lot I have at least a few iOS apps that tend to crash a lot from the most simple and easy to reproduce functions of the app. I'm curious if any devs have had experience with this, and have found that their apps are eventually removed due to this. I mean, Apple gets tons of crash reports all the time, and surely they'd notice their mistake fairly quickly, and pull the app from the store, right? The question is: Will Apple eventually remove an app that has been crashing on a large number of user's devices, even if it passed review?\n\nA: I've a couple of simple apps in the Mac App Store. When uploading them, Apple thoroughly test the app, from the functionality of the application itself, to whether or not the app quits when the last window open is closed. The same approval process applies to iOS application loading, though I haven't experienced it personally. \nThe applications that aren't working for you now would have worked when they were released. The most usual issue would be an iOS update crippling the app's functionality, for reasons known to the developer.\n\nA: I've downloaded apps in the past that completely don't work. I don't think Apple checks them, but if there were enough complaints from customers they would do something about it. However thats not just negative reviews, I mean people going and reporting a problem with it or asking for a refund.\n", "Q: Can Apple watch warn me when my iphone is out of range Now and then I manage to leave for office without my iPhone. As I depend on some two factor authentication apps and other stuff on the phone this basically means that I have to go back and get it.\nIt would be an extremly helpful feature if Apple watch could warn me actively when my iPhone gets out of its range. The little red indicator that watch displays in the top bar is not enough. I need a tap and some beeps.\nI looked around the Watch app on my iPhone but could not find any setting activating such a feature.\nIs there a way to get my watch to warn me when my iPhone is out of range? An app maybe?\n\nA: Ensure iPhone is updated to iOS15 and your watch is updated to WatchOS8. The watch does not need to have cellular connectivity features.\nOn your phone, go to Find My app.\n\n*\n\n*Select your phone\n\n*Scroll to Notifications\n\n*The Notify When Left Behind setting is in that box (note: The \"Notify when Found\" stays grayed-out)\n\n\nOn your watch, go the the app Find Devices and select \"Allow when Using the App\"\n\nWhen you step away leaving your phone behind, you should get a notification on the watch about 5 minutes after the connection is lost between the phone and the watch.\n\n\nA: I haven't found an app that does this yet either. Your best bet would be to wait for the upgrade to watchOS 2.\nThis should enable developers to add more functionality to their apps, including the function you're in need of.\n\nA: Try the 'Lookout' app. (Lookout.com)\n", "Q: Yosemite 10.10 Install?

You are trying to upgrade from 10.7 to 10.10 and its possible you either can't do that, or your machine is incompatible. Although I expect it would tell you as such.\nIn any case, what ever the reason is your only real way forward is to backup with Time Machine if you haven't already onto an external hard drive, and then do a fresh install rather than an upgrade.\nAfter you've done this during the install process you'll be able to import old backups etc... You can use your backup from Time Machine to restore your files on OS X 10.10.\n", "Q: Backup iPhone without iTunes I recently dropped my iPhone in water and it was working fine right after that, but the next morning I was prompted with an ‘activation required’ screen. \nI’m afraid ‘activating’ will wipe out everything on my iPhone, so I’m trying to back everything up before doing that.\nHowever, both iTunes and a third party tool called iMazing won't let me back anything up before activating.\nI know that none of the data has been affected by the water because (a) it shows up in iMazing and (b) the lock screen still has my old wallpaper, language settings etc.\nSo, 2 questions: does activating my iPhone restore it back to factory? And how can I backup my iPhone without iTunes on Windows/Mac/Linux?\n\nA: Question 1\nThe activation message doesn't mean it will do a factory restore, no, however it is possible that not all to the data will be retrievable even though you can see it.\nQuestion 2\nIf you cannot get to the Settings app, which you can't from what you've described, then without activation there is no way to use iCloud to backup. iTunes would be the only option in this case.\nDo you have an iCloud backup by chance?\n", "Q: How to move data from the cloned external drive to the newly installed ssd? So here is my situation:\nI want to upgrade my MacBook Pro mid 2010 to Samsung ssd 850 Evo. I used carbon copy cloner to clone my Mac to an external drive (WD My passport for Mac). Then I installed the Samsung ssd in my Mac. And now I'm trying to get the data back from the external drive to my newly installed ssd but having difficulties. What's the best way to do that? \n\nA: If I am understanding correctly it sounds like he cloned is old internal drive to an external drive, installed an SSD in the Mac and now wants to copy his files back.\nIf the new drive has Mac OS installed on it (if not probably best to install it. COMMAND-R and select internet recovery) you can just use Migration Assistant to copy your user files and (optionally) apps to the internal drive. Run Migration assistant and it will have an option for restoring from a local drive. Just select your CCC backup.\nIf the new drive has nothing on it, reboot the Mac while holding OPTION and select the external drive to boot from. Then use CCC to clone the boot drive to the internal drive. Doing it this way you won't get your recovery partition and might end up with other boot issues. Go back and use the first procedure.\n\nA: I am assuming you are just turning on the Macbook? Have you tried holding down the Option key as stated here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204417 and choosing the drive to boot from in the Startup Manager? And do you have an external drive also plugged in? Or just the new one? The computer may be trying to find the old boot drive? You don't say what is happening.\nAs stated in the comment you did not provide us with what the difficulties are.\nAfter it boots the first time you can set the default startup disk. I would have preferred to use a comment for this but I don't have enough rep for that.\n", "Q: Installing VirtualBox guest additions on v4.3.28 (IE no Devices menu tab)?

In all the screenshots on the help it shows Devices next to Window and that is just not present on my VB (See screenshot). I've checked in other menus and VB preferences but I don't see anything related to guest additions or devices anywhere.\n\n\nA: You'll only get that menu once you start the Virtual Machine, which launches in a separate application in the Dock.

Can projects compiled in older versions of Xcode run properly (or at all) on newer version of iOS?\nFor example, can a project compiled in Xcode 4.2 run on platforms with iOS 8.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: If You're not using removed API it should run OK. However some methods behave differently. You can have problems with UI (for example Alerts and Actionsheets now uses different API). If You targeted iOS < 7 then UI will definitely be messed up.\nYou can check API differences on Apple Developer site (it's iOS 7.1 - 8.0 diff, check the earlier diffs to be sure).\nTo sum up: if You've been following Apple recomendations while writting code in earlier Xcode for earlier iOS there should not be many problems. But You'll never know until You run and test it.  \n\nA: I'm definitely no expert, but from what I've seen, occasionally certain parts of code need updating/re-writing to allow Xcode to compile with a newer SDK.\n", "Q: Understanding what patching mean when installing programs I've downloaded a program which gives me the instructions in this order:\n\n[MacOSX]\n  1.Install/Update the software.\n  2.Copy patched AU/VST/RTAS.\n  3.Run our keygen on Windows.\n  4.Run the software and start activation.\n  5.Select offline activation.\n  6.Copy ComputerID to the keygen.\n  7.Generate a Serial Number and an Authorization File.\n  8.Register and Enjoy!  \n\nI opened Wine on my macbook in order to get the keygen to work.  However, when I save the authorization file it does not appear on my desktop.\nAlthough, my main problem here is understanding what patching actually means.\nWhat is it asking me to do?\nI don't understand what I must do in order to activate this program.\n\nA: A Patch is a small executable file which is used to change usually small sections of an existing application's code - for instance to fix small bugs noticed after the app's release… or, unfortunately in this case, to bypass the app's built-in security.\nIn this instance, with the patch being unofficial & not distributed by the original developers, you have no way of knowing what additional payload might be in the patch - including key loggers, phone home code, botnet distribution networks… etc, etc.\nPatches are not as common as they used to be.\nTheir benefit of being small & lightweight was most useful back when we were all on slow dial-up connections & software was released on CD/DVD - making it a large task to update user's software by sending out new CDs or making them download entire new versions.\nA patch of only a few MB was then the best way to update.\nNow we all have faster connections, the trend is now to issue a brand new updated version, which overwrites the old version entirely.\n", "Q: Create a playlist of songs loved/likes on Apple Music I've been listening to the Apple Music thing that came out in iOS 8.4 and I've been clicking the little heart button on the songs I've liked assuming I'd be able to find these songs again.\nIs there anyway to get a list/playlist of the songs I've clicked the heart button for? \n\nA: A lot of people are making this mistake at the moment, the like/love button in Apple Music is not for creating a playlist.\nIt's there to tune the 'For You' section in Apple Music to your tastes so it can better make suggestions of what music you should try out next.\nEDIT\nAs you've pointed out in your comment there is an ability to create a smart playlist of Loved songs in iTunes, however this is only referring to songs that you've Loved that are physically in your iTunes library, i.e. songs that you bought or ripped from a CD.\nIt is confusing but Loved in your iTunes library is unrelated to Loved in Apple Music.\nEDIT 2\nI've been playing some more and I managed to get the Playlist to include a song I Loved once I had downloaded it for offline playback in iTunes and then marked it.

Originally I was thinking that I would purchase software for his PC so that he talk into his PC's microphone and the software would take care of converting it into speech.  In thinking through this further I realized that maybe using an iPhone or iPad he could do something similar.  He currently has a PC desktop, a ChromeBook as his laptop and a flip phone as his cell phone.  Would it make more sense for him to use either an iPhone or IPad to do this speech to text conversion and what additional software (if any) would be necessary?\n\nA: My Grandfather had a similar need, he hand wrote his memoirs on paper and then wanted to turn them into a self published book.\nThe best way to do this is to get someone who has good English skills and is fast at typing to do it.\nSpeech recognition software is not use-friendly for those who are not tech savvy, I wouldn't suggest it is an easy way for him to use a computer. They are also incredibly inaccurate.\nI would argue at this point Google Voice and Apple's Dictation features have better recognition than the leading product on the market as they learn from their users over time where as most standalone products have limited data to work from.\nHowever it's worth a try, for OS X you'll need Nuance's Dragon Dictate for Mac it works I've tried two versions but it's not great however. It is pretty pricey, and you'll need to get the headset, it won't work very well with a poor quality microphone or just a ambient mic on your Mac.\nThey also have an app on iTunes that is free, again it works okay, but not great.\nThe main issue with dictation is that you have to say all the punctuation and often words are misheard and that can in turn confuse it with the next few words, it's also very difficult to think of what you want to say in written language quickly enough.\nIn conclusion, I honestly wouldn't recommend voice recognition, especially if you are hoping to make it easier for him. I would suggest he uses an iPad and types it, or you sit with him and he dictates it. My Granddad had my Mum do this in the end, 3-4 months of weekly meet-ups he was very happy and they had a great excuse to spend time together.\n", "Q: How to re-span a cron-like launchd script in case of script error? I have a cron-like launchd script (StartCalendarInterval) that does a backup of some website data once per day:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.example.backup</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Volumes/Example/backup.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>2</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>15</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/var/log/com.example/backup_error</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/var/log/com.example/backup_output</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIn rare cases it might go wrong when the Internet is not available. The backup.sh script then sets a proper error code that is larger than 0.\nNow I would like that the script is automatically relaunched an hour later after an error. And again and again until there is no error. But not after 24 hours to avoid two instances of the script running at the same time.\nI believe this must be possible with ThrottleInterval and SuccessfulExit. My problem is that SuccessfulExit is linked to KeepAlive. I do not want the script to run all the time, but just once a day via the StartCalendarInterval.\nIs my task doable directly with launchd? Or should I simply add wait 1 hour and try again after error to my script? The script would require resources all the time when set up like this. I would like to avoid this.\n\nA: It seems it can be done partially. Basically the problem was that KeepAlive in combination with SuccessfulExit implied a RunAtLoad (the program was launched right at the start and not at the specified StartCalendarIntervall.) Setting the additional parameter AfterInitialDemand (which is undocumented) will change this behaviour and the program is first launched at the specified calendar time:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.example.backup</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Volumes/Example/backup.sh</string>\n    </array>\n\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>2</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>15</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n        <key>AfterInitialDemand</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n    <integer>3600</integer>\n\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/var/log/com.example/backup_error</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/var/log/com.example/backup_output</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe only problem is that if the program/ script fails then ThrottleInterval will overrule the StartCalendarInterval, so depending on time of error and the set interval the program/ script would not launch exactly at the specified calendar time after a day has elapsed (assuming it failed until then) and might continue at odd time offsets (until it succeeds.)\nBut to sum it up: the trick is the undocumented AfterInitialDemand set to true.\n", "Q: iMac mid 2010 running slow [Specs of the iMac, the iMac already have 8GB(Should be enough to handle Yosemite)]\n[1]http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i3-3.2-21-inch-aluminum-mid-2010-specs.html#macspecs1\nYesterday i bought this iMac, it's took around 45mins to boot up and it's unusable due to the slow response.

It does not let me download the results, but only shows them in iTunes. It does not show all purchases, but instead shows results one screenful at a time. And it does not even show purchases as individal line items, but shows them grouped into collections you need to click into.

Has anyone actually succeeded in doing this?\n\nA: You asked, \"is there any way to script the UI?\"  Yes, if you are on a Mac.  You also asked, \"Has anyone actually succeeded in doing this?\"  Sort of.  My history goes back to 2005, and the iTunes Store session kept timing out, so I had to run it it batches, but the following script does work.  Be aware that it runs very slowly;  simply retrieving the class of an object from iTunes can take almost a second.  I would welcome any performance enhancements anyone can suggest.\nThis worked on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with iTunes 12.3.2.35, and on OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 with iTunes 12.3.2.35, on or around February 28th, 2016.

Also note, that multiple purchases in the same day (like albumbs) get lumped together and you have to click the tiny -> symbol to see meaningful details. \n\nA: this script actually does work! just not as expected…\n\n\n*\n\n*i followed the directions, but i got an error: something about not being able to handle the TITLES as a string (?). this took about 2-3 minutes.\n\n*first suspicions:\n\n\n*\n\n*when i copy-n-pasted the code into Script Editor, the following lines were “interpreted” i.e. \\n showed up as a [literal/visual] line break, as did \\t showing up as a tab [literal/visual]\n\n\n*\n\n*set myOutput to myOutput & \"\\n\"\n\n*if ready then set myOutput to myOutput & val & \"\\t\"\n\n\n*commas separating the “Titles included in order” indicating multiple purchases in a single day\n\n*i was wrong… i think… i dunno.\n\n\n*on a lark, i jumped to the LAST batch (apparently, my fist purchase with this account was in 2004 which meant 49 batches) and ran the script again\n\n\n*\n\n*result: the script was running longer than expected, so i assumed an error and stopped the process after about 10 minutes… BUT there WAS a *.txt file generated [in my Documents folder]. this file showed data for \n\n\n*\n\n*the LAST batch [that was showing in iTunes when i started the script] THEN \n\n*the FIRST batch [BATCH 1, showing my most recent purchases]\n\n*when i went to iTunes, i noticed that BATCH 2 was displayed\n\n\n*conclusion: the command for the NEXT button (click button \"Next\" of webArea) was working.

(…and my theory about the commas was diminished)\n\n\n*in order to get the info i needed (batches 1-13 of 49), i did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*jumped to the LAST batch (here, the 49th batch)\n\n*ran the script\n\n*i monitored iTunes, and watched the batch display automatically change until it showed BATCH 14\n\n*i stopped the script and checked the *.txt file in my Documents folder\n\n*LO! the *.txt file showed my purchases from [my last] BATCH 49 through BATCH 13!\n\n\n*not done yet! i wanted to repeat the initial error to record the exact error and to see if my initial suspicions made sense. NOPE! i started from the beginning, and THIS:\n\n\n*\n\n*the script ran as expected\n\n*the only error (so far, because i’m still running the script) was a lost connection timeout at BATCH 21\n\n\n\ncurrently, the script is working on BATCH 32…\nTIMING:\n\n\n*\n\n*based on the creation date of the generated *.txt file and the modification times (which i am also monitoring), it looks like each batch takes about 3 minutes to process and update said *.txt file.\n\n*so far, for my 49 batches (lost connection timeout NOT included) it’s taken…\n\n\n*\n\n*BATCHES 1-21 = @45 minutes\n\n*BATCHES 21-49 (in progress: current SAVED batch = 34) = @30 minutes\n\n\n\ni know… TMI! TMI!\nbut i hope this helps!\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n*RE: #5 above… “ the only error (so far, because i’m still running the script) was a lost connection timeout at BATCH 21”\n\n\n*\n\n*i re-started the script, starting at BATCH 21 (where the lost connection timeout happened)\n\n*i expected it to end at BATCH 1… NOPE! it kept going, uninterrupted, until it rounded upon itself and recorded up to BATCH 20 (which will display BATCH 21 in iTunes upon completion)\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION: the script will run from BATCH[n] to BATCH[n-1]    (provided NO timeouts/interruptions)\n", "Q: Is it possible to continue using an to external monitor when closing the lid on a Macbook Air? I have an application I use on an external monitor with an external USB device.\nIs there a way to close the lid and continue using the app on the external monitor?\nI turned off the sleep upon close function, but the external monitor still turns off.\nOSX 10.9.5\n\nA: Yes, I think keeping the power on here is the key. When I remove the magsafe from my MBP it automatically goes to sleep and turns off the external display.\nIf you really want to keep it from sleeping even when you are not connected to an external power source, you can use InsomniaX or Caffeine.\n\nA: Yes, its called \"closed clamshell\" mode. In short, you'll need to attach your MBA to a mouse, a keyboard and power:\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT201834\n", "Q: Install OS X on a MacBook Pro with empty SSD I have a MacBook Pro Retina 13.3\" which had OS X 10.10. I erased the entire SSD with Disk Manager and tried to reinstall OS X. Unfortunately, my internet connection isn't good so it would take more than two days to download the installation files, so I downloaded the OS X .dmg on another computer and I made an USB bootable device with OS X 10.10 using PowerISO on Windows 7. Now when I try to install it using the C or CMD+R key, it doesn't show up. I only have the option to use Internet Recovery and I can't use it because it doesn't load. After a while it says \"apple.com/support -2002F\".\nAny help, guys? And sorry for my bad english, haha.\nThank you.\n\nA: ⌘R only opens a specific preexisting partition on a hard drive that's already had OS X installed, so it makes sense that it wouldn't get you anywhere. You want to hold down Option as you press the Power button and watch the computer boot up. That tells the computer to list all the drives you can possibly boot from, and then you just select your bootable drive using the arrow keys and Return.\n\nA: You need to hold option Key during booting process, then click on 'install OSX', it will bring you to the installation process with disk utility where you can create a partition for your new OS, make sure to just wipe it in correct format which usually would be OSX Journaled, it can also be APFS if you're using SSD and installing anything from 10.13 upwards. \n", "Q: Where should a command line tool store cache files in OS X? /var/cache is missing, ~/Library/Caches seems to be for full-fledged applications rather than command line tools, tools I've seen in the wild do horrible things (like use the user's home directory). Where is the correct - or at least predictable and reliable - location?\n\nA: It depends on the type of data being cached - is it per user or system wide? \nIf per user, there's nothing wrong with using a dot-prefixed directory in the user's home directory (that's what it's for, after all, and very much the UNIX way) or perhaps /tmp/<username> if the data is not to be persisted. If it's system wide and meant to be persisted, check the hier manual page - /var/db/<appname> may be an option?\nOne other Mac OS-specific option is to use /var/folders (as documented in hier(7)). As mentioned, you can retrieve the user-specific temporary directory by calling getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR.\n", "Q: How can I change 'history' command output? So by default .bash_history stores 500 last used commands. I changed that to 5000 by setting HISTFILESIZE=5000 in .bash_profile It seems to work.\nNow when I do history it still prints 500 commands, but now it does so not from 1 to 500, but from 36 to 535 (earlier commands are stored but not printed). \nI'd like for history to print 1000 last used commands. How can I achieve that?\nAlso recently I tried history -a and haven't noticed anything change. What does this command do? Man history doesn't help.\n\nA: In addition to HISTFILESIZE, you also need to set HISTSIZE, which controls the number of commands to keep in memory until they are saved.\nAlso, the manual page for history is available via man bash.  Scroll down to SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS, and you'll find it.  The details about HISTSIZE and other variables are further up in the same manual page.\n", "Q: Is Night Mode in iOS really sight-friendly? I am pretty used right know to reading things on dark backgrounds and I feel that my eyes get less tired than with regular white backgrounds, especially while programming or basically any activity that involves hours looking at the screen.\nMy question is, on iPad and iPhone, how does Night Mode really work?\nI mean, does it iluminate the black pixels on the screen, or does the OS keep them off so that your eyes receive the less amount of light possible?\nIt could seem to be a little silly, but for me is very important as I use this device for reading a considerable amount of time.\n\nA: While the display's backlight is always illuminated, a black pixel is blocking nearly all the light from behind it so that in effect your eye does receive much less light. In this case, if you find reading with dark backgrounds easier then Night Mode will be helpful. What you don't get is any energy savings.\n\nA: The black pixels are still illuminated by the backlight. The display's architecture does not facilitate only providing backlight to lit pixels, unlike OLED or similar.\n", "Q: Transfer app without developer enrollment I have two apple ID's. I created a new one for my new company and bought enrollment for it. The old account has three apps that are no longer available on the store, since the enrollment ran out of time on the first account. \nI have bought memebership for the new account.\nIt seems like I can't transfer any applications from the old account to the new account before the old account has enrolled again. The option 'Transfer this app' simply does not show up anymore. The apps are stuck at the status 'Pending Contract'.\nWhat can I do to transfer the apps from the old account from the new one?\nWill I have to pay for a membership for the old account too?\n\nA: Apple Support is your absolute best contact. They might be willing to let you renew your old account and then refund the fee once you get the apps all transferred out or be able to work something else out.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/\nThey could say, you need to pay $200 - one for each account to make them both active and then do the transfer. After all, if you have the code, you could simply recompile and resubmit the app under a new name if it didn't make you $100 to keep the old name in terms of recognition and continuity of app store ratings, good will, reduced app review time.\n", "Q: Mail.app does not sync Junk folder with Gmail I am running Mail.app on Yosemite with a few Gmail accounts on IMAP. Everything is syncing just fine, with the exception of the Junk folders: every time I use \"Erase junk mail...\", the emails are immediately deleted from the client, but they still show up in Gmail's spam folder.\n\nThis doesn't happen with the other folders (sent mail ecc): whenever I delete an item from one of these folders, the change is synced to the server. They are also configured in the same way in Mail.app:\n\nHow can I make sure that emptying the Junk folder in Mail.app deleted all spam from Gmail web as well?\n\nA: In your IMAP folders, do you still have the junk folder inside the GMAIL folder ? If so, you should select it, and the choose \"use as -> junk\" in the mailbox folder.\n\nA: make sure your IMAP Path Prefix is set to [Gmail]; or [Google Mail] in some locales. try the Gmail prefix first. the [brackets] are required.\n\nopen the Mail app, select the Spam folder under your Gmail account in the Mailboxes sidebar; then on the Mail Menubar, choose Mailbox‣Use This Mailbox As‣Junk Mailbox. you can/should also do this for Drafts, Archive, Sent, and Trash.\n\n", "Q: Backup Time Capsule to 'cloud' / online backup provider I've got a 3 TB Time Capsule that stores a range of files and Time Machine backups. I’d like to be able to backup the whole Time Capsule offsite, ideally using a \"cloud\" backup provider. \nThe Time Capsule itself is a stand alone unit (not tethered to any machine). Is this possible? \n\nA: Another way is to do a second time capsule backup to the cloud.  As long as you can specify the location \"as a folder\" to time machine, then you have time machine making 2 backups for you.  \nI do 2 backups, one to the Airport Time Capsule unit and one to a different network drive.  I know it is not in the cloud, but if you can do as I mentioned above, that is another way to do it.\nI also use SOS backup to the cloud.  If I specify the time machine backup folder, it will do exactly as you are asking.  \n\nA: Though I have not used this product on a Mac, nor in this particular way, it should work.\nthere is a product called Syncovery which will backup selected files to \"FTP, SSH, HTTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure, SugarSync, box.net and many other cloud storage providers\". We use it successfully to copy backups from a local server to our Amazon S3 account.\nI would imagine that you could tell Syncovery what source to use and it would back up your time capsule to Amazon S3 (or other). As I have not used this specific app for this specific function I would recommend asking their tech support to verify if this is something they support.\nNote I have no financial interest in this company, just a satisfied user of their (PC) product.\n", "Q: Preview disables clickable links in PDF files When a Mac Preview user sees a link in the PDF and tries to click it nothing happens, although the mouse cursor changes indicating that the link is clickable.\nUsers using other applications than Mac Preview such as Acrobat have no problems.\nDoes Apple Preview disable clickable links in PDF in general or is it PDF dependent? \n\n\nA: The problem was in the encoding of the URL. Apparently Preview is more picky about that compared to other pdf viewers such as Adobe.\nAlso, it turns out to work better if we put the image inside the link\n<a ...>\n  <img ...>xx</img>\n</a>\n\n", "Q: Xcode/WatchKit - how do I run the regular app on iPad/other devices? Could anyone please tell me, now that I have added a WatchKit target to my application, if it is possible to just run the main target on devices which don't support the watch (i.e. the original part of the app which worked on iPads and iPhoneOS < 8?).\nXcode keeps telling me I can no longer run the main app target (not the watchkit target) on my iPad because:\nIneligible Devices : My iPad (Apple Watch not supported)\nDoes this mean I will have to keep two versions of my project- one for WatchKit apps and one for non-WatchKit apps?! \nAll I want to do is run and debug the main app, part of a larger project which includes a Watch interface, on a device which cannot pair with an Apple Watch. Apologies if this has been asked already, some Monday google-foo couldn't find an answer; also please feel free to edit the question if it seems unclear.\n\nA: Turns out this is a completely non-issue.\nRestart the device. \nAnswered here to keep the keywords for search, in case (like I did) others assume that it's a WatchKit issue, not a device/xCode connection issue.\n\nA: I really always wants to run the apps without Xcode but failed many times. This time i found one fantastic article about installing of side loading apps without Xcode. Sideload iOS Apps Without Xcode on Windows/Mac [iPhone/iPad] that too without jailbreak.\n", "Q: Ruined 2006 imac - Only allowed to reinstall Lion which is no longer availiable I have a 2006 imac which was installed with lion and now I've got it to a point where the OS became corrupt. I've put a maverick install on a bootable USB but when I boot from the USB doesn't give me the option to \"Install OSX\" it only gives me the option to \"Reinstall OSX Lion\" which doesn't work because that is no longer availaibile from the app store. I've tried to format the harddrive and that doesn't change anything.\nMy question is, how do I get the option to install a new OS fresh instead of only being given the option to reinstall Lion which does not work.\n\nA: If you don't have your original OS X 10.4 \"Tiger\" install media, you'll have to obtain a retail version of any system up to 10.7.5.; 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\"\n10.9 \"Mavericks\" and 10.10 \"Yosemite\" require a 2007 or newer iMac to be installed.\nI've found a couple of supposedly original retail installation media for 10.7 searching on eBay for $35-$40 (1), (2); just be sure to buy the retail version and not the recovery DVD unless it is exactly the same that came your iMac model.\nYou can try your luck downloading the OS from a non official source, but I wouldn't recommend that.\n\nA: You can purchase the retail packaged Snow Leopard DVD and then the downloadable Lion from the Apple store for US$19.99 each. You will need to install Snow Leopard first from disc, update to 10.6.8, then download and install Lion. There is no Lion install DVD available from Apple. \n\nA: You said that you have run Lion on this machine.\nIf you login with the same Apple ID in Appstore there should be a downloadable Lion in the Purchases tab.\n", "Q: VirtualBox No Internet Win7 Host, OS X Guest I have set up Mac OS X 10.9 in a Virtual Machine and I'm struggling to get any internet connection. In my network settings (Mac), it says I'm connected but nothing works. Safari doesn't load any page, AppStore doesn't load anything (all greyed out).\nIn VirtualBox, the only settings that showed any connection at all within the VM was Bridged Adapter with an Adapter Type of Intel PRO/1000 MT Server.\nWhat can I do to get a connection going within the VM?\n\nA: In Virtual box try changing the connection mode to NAT instead of Bridge.\nIf NAT works than there is some issue with DHCP Server or Router that assigns the IP address to your network.\n", "Q: Eliminating duplicate middle clicks I'm using Microsoft mouse software with either a trackball or the Explorer 3 mouse. Sometimes, when I middle-click, instead of the new tab opening on button-up, it happens on button-down and button-up. Sometimes it happens twice on button-up. This means if I middle-click a link in chrome, I might get from 1-3 tabs opened. I can't figure out how to eliminate this behavior. \nI am using a Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 on a 2014 MBP 15\" running Yosemite 10.10.4. I'm running the intellipoint 8.2 drivers, and \"mouse wheel click\" is set to \"Handled by Mac OS\". At one point I was using USB overdrive, but I uninstalled it. Removing/inserting the mouse doesn't seem to help. The behavior is inconsistent - it seems to come and go in bursts. \n\nA: @Tetsujin's comment was correct - this mouse was actually defective.

Then, you select the device from the top bar when it is connected, and open the \"Music\" tab, and you can select and delete songs from the list.\n\n\nA: When your iPod touch runs low on memory, problems like slow speed, crashing of the device, etc. are very common. Deleting content, like songs, from your iPod touch can be an excellent way to tackle these problems. You can delete songs directly from iPod device, or remove tracks via iTunes or other iTunes alternative.\n", "Q: iOS 8.4 Apple Music App: How to shuffle all songs by an artist? With the complete redesign featuring the new streaming mixin (which I don't use), it seems that when listening to music from my library (stored on my device) I can only shuffle songs within a single album for an artist. \nThis is not a dupe of this question, in that I'm not asking how to shuffle all songs in the library. \n\nA: Instead of selecting the artist to display the albums and songs of the artist, tap the image of the artist and the artists songs will play shuffled. \n\nA: Answer: Siri > Play \" artist \" songs shuffle\n\nA: These seem to be the current ways to shuffle in the new 8.4 Music.app: About.com \"How to Shuffle Music on the iPhone\" - Updated 7/8/2015 \n\nShuffle All Songs\nTo shuffle all the songs in your Music app library, which will give\n  you the greatest variety and a roughly random order of songs, follow\n  these easy steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Music app\n  \n*Tap My Music\n  \n*Make sure the menu just below Apple Music is set to Songs\n  \n*Find a song you'd like to listen to and tap it to begin it playing\n  \n*Tap the playback bar just above the buttons at the bottom of the\n  screen to reveal the album art and full set of Music app controls\n  \n*At the bottom of the screen, tap the Shuffle button, which is two arrows crossing over each other. You'll know it's enabled when it's\n  highlighted.\nWith that done, your next song will be randomly chosen and you're off\n  on a shuffling adventure. Use the forward arrow to skip to the next\n  song or the back arrow to return to the last one.\n​To turn off shuffle, just tap the two-arrow icon again so it is no\n  longer highlighted.\n\n\nA: This is an indirect method, absent an actual shuffle button on the artist's page, that works for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap For You at the bottom of the app\n\n*Tap Apple Music at the top\n\n*Search for an artist\n\n*In the search results, tap on Songs\n\n*Tap on a song to begin playing\n\n*Tap the banner at the bottom for the currently playing song\n\n*Tap the shuffle button\n\n\nYou'll now be listening to a shuffle of all songs by that artist.  Definitely less convenient, but it seems to work.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Tap My Music\n\n*If it doesn't say \"Artists\" in red under the recently added section, tap the label and select Artists\n\n*Now select the artist you want to shuffle\n\n*If they have one album, the shuffle button is there in front of you\n\n*If they have multiple albums, tap the three dot icon (...) to the right of the share button (the square with the up arrow).\n\n*Tap \"Play Next\"\n\n*use the control center or other method to skip to the next song\n\n\nTo confirm that you added all the songs you want, click the now playing banner and click the \"menu\" icon to the right of the \"next song\" arrows, this will bring up all the songs that are up next.\nIf that's too lengthy, you can use Siri to play songs by an artist - one tap to accomplish. \n\nSiri play songs by U2 shuffle\n\nYou can also make a playlist with the artists you desire and play those by tapping or by voice control.\n\nA: NOT IMPOSSIBLE to shuffle all your music unless you have an Internet connection.  (i.e.  It IS possible to shuffle all songs, though it's not exactly intuitive.)\nProcedure:  \n1) Open music app.\n2) Open My Music (left button at bottom of screen).\n3) Press Songs in middle of screen (in list of Artists, Albums, etc.)  You may need to scroll to top of page.\n4) Press album cover icon at far left of any song in the list.\n5) Press \"now playing\" bar near bottom of screen (directly above My Music, Playlists, Radio, etc.) at very bottom of screen.  Album cover and full transport controls will appear.\n6) Press shuffle button at bottom left/center of screen (below horizontal volume bar).\n7) Press Next transport button (on right side of Play button).  All songs in phone will play in random (shuffled) order.  \n\nA: If you are willing to use alternative players I found this app on the App Store called Ecoute.  It seamlessly works with your iTunes music library and you can shuffle on artist, genre and more.  It is a basic, easy and intuitive player... \n\"\n\nA: FOund this in another forum, by another person and it works:\nGo into your music, type the artists name in the search bar and make sure that 'my music' is selected. then the artist will come up, their albums will come up, then their songs will come up. Click on songs and once you play one you can press shuffle and it will shuffle all of the songs from that artist. \n\nA: As with many of the other responses, I have found the easiest method for shuffling all songs for an artist with multiple albums:\n-My Music\n-Make sure Artists is selected\n-Scroll to your artist\n-Tap the icon to the left of the name of the artist - this will usually be a thumbnail graphic of an album cover\n-Tap the song bar towards the bottom of the screen\n-Tap the \"shuffle\" icon at the bottom - this will look like two crossing arrows\n\nA: tell Siri to play my music on shuffle.\n\nA: It's impossible to shuffle all your music unless you have an internet connection, which is the most ridiculous thing in a long line of bad design moves from Apple.\nI've moved across to this free app https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/musis-a-simple-music-player/id849003298?mt=8\nwhich works very nicely with your existing music library, has very intuitive controls, shuffles, and no it's not in Korean despite the screenshots!\n", "Q: Minecraft Immediately Crashes On Launchup I'm running Mavericks 10.9.5.\nThis is my java version:\n\nWhenever I started Minecraft up, it would immediately crash.\nI tried:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling Minecraft  \n\n*Deleting the minecraft folder in Application Support  \n\n*Reinstalling Java\n\n\nHints for the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the most recent Java.

Every time I open an app and it restores the windows that it has open, they generally restore to whichever space is currently active, rather than to the space the windows were originally on before I quit the app. For example, if I have several terminal windows open on different spaces, quit Terminal.app and relaunch it, then the terminal windows all reopen, but do so on the current space. TextEdit, Xcode, iTunes, Messages, all of the apps I use have this problem. The only one that reopens its windows to the correct space is Finder.\nThis is annoying, because it means that every time I reboot my computer I have reorganize all of my spaces again. And I have lots of windows open, and they're all organized across six different spaces. It's getting tedious.\nIs there a trick, hack, or something I can use to fix this?\n\nA: It's unclear from your question whether you have done the obvious so I will mention it just in case.\nWhen looking at a specific space, right click (option click) on the icon (in the dock) of the app you want to \"pin\" to the specific space . There will be two options shown that say something like \"this space\" or \"any space\" (I'm sorry, I'm not on my Mac so I can't be more precise, but I think you will be able to understand this method)\n\nA: As far as I know there is no way to \"pin\" app windows so they'll be restored to different Spaces in Mission Control after quitting/reopening apps within the same login session.  However… if Reopen windows when logging back in is selected when logging out, app windows are restored to the same previous Spaces when logging in again.  I take advantage of that primarily for Safari restarts when I have lots of its windows spread out across different Spaces.  Can be less tedious just to log out and in again with those windows put back where they originally were than to do it manually after quitting/reopening Safari.\n", "Q: How to prevent storing the WiFi password on the recovery partition? I always wondered how my Mac could connect to the internet when the recovery partition is booted and my main system partition is locked (filevault2). \nSome googling revealed today (e.g. here, here,\nand also on askdifferent) that the WiFi password is apparently stored in NVRAM and that needs to be reset to remove the password. As a security conscious person this is unacceptable to me. When using Full Disk Encryption (i. e. Filevault2) I expect the system to be safe, also against my network. \nSo is there a way to prevent OS X from making the password available in the recovery partition? I am not sure how or when it gets into NVRAM in the first place. \nUPDATE1:\nThe NVRAM contains the following keys: (nvram -p) :\nBootCampHD\nSystemAudioVolume\nSystemAudioVolumeDB\naht-results\nbacklight-level\nbluetoothActiveControllerInfo\nbluetoothInternalControllerInfo\nboot-gamma\nefi-apple-recovery\nefi-boot-device\nefi-boot-device-data\nfmm-computer-name\ngood-samaritan-message\ngpu-policy\nprev-lang:kbd\n\nThe keys efi-apple-recovery and efi-boot-device look like they could contain encrypted data.\n\nA: I've always wondered the same thing: how to keep OS X from storing the WPA passphrase (or PSK) in NVRAM.\nUsing 'nvram' I could never find the variable that I thought held these credentials. Today, I tried booting to a USB live image of Linux and running Chipsec. Its command to list EFI variables has many more results than I was getting by running nvram within OS X. Among the variables in my MacBook Pro (mid-2010) were:\n\n\n*\n\n*current-network \n\n*preferred-networks\n\n*security-password\nThe current-network variable's data includes the SSID of my home router, in plaintext. Then it is padded with 0-bytes up until the end, which is 32 bytes, and represents the 64 hex digits of the Pre-Shared Key (PSK). \nThe preferred-networks variable looks like the same contents as current-network.\nThe security-password variable holds exactly the same number of bytes as the EFI password I set, so I assume this is the Firmware Lock password. I suspect it uses some kind of masking/encoding. One theory I had is that these passwords are stored as keyboard scan codes or something, but I don't have enough info yet.\nPerhaps using Chipsec or another EFI tool, you can zero out these EFI variables and set an access control / permissions flag on them so that they cannot be rewritten. Perhaps even just zeroing them out will be a workaround for you (if you just need to resell the laptop or something). It's unknown to me whether OS X rewrites them regularly or just when you change your WPA credentials.\nEDIT:\nI just learned of a command for retrieving wifi passwords from NVRAM:\n    /usr/libexec/airportd readNVRAM\nAlso, by attaching the GUID, nvram can actually read these values:\n\n\n*\n\n*nvram 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:current-network\n\n*nvram 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:preferred-networks\n\n*nvram 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:preferred-count\nSo, maybe you can blow those variables away and see how it goes.\nEDIT 2: as mentioned by an earlier comment, the method to delete an EFI variable is as follows (sudo required to delete): sudo nvram -d 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:current-network\nIt's unclear as of yet whether the variable will return.\n", "Q: How do I clear out \"Recent Rooms\" in Outlook 2011 when I am creating a Meeting or Appointment?

I use AirDrop quite often to quickly send pictures that I take on my iPhone, to my Mac. The problem is, I have several Macs (all of them are Mac minis) and when I activate AirDrop on my iPhone, they all show up with the exact same name.\n\nI've Googled, and the only three ways of changing the displayed name in AirDrop that I've found are:\n\n\n*\n\n*changing the computer name in System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer Name,\n\n*changing the \"Me\" card's name in Contacts, or\n\n*modifying a Plist file with the command\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES.\n\n\nUnfortunately, none of these are working for me. 1 doesn't seem to apply, as my computers already have unique names in the Sharing control panel, but they don't show up in the AirDrop display on my iPhone. 2 wouldn't work, because changing the \"me\" card would sync across to the other Mac (my contacts are syncing using iCloud). I tried 3 and it doesn't work either - the AirDrop item disappears from Finder, however my computer still shows up in the AirDrop display on my iPhone. The only working solution I found was by turning off WiFi on any computers that I don't want to show up in AirDrop, which prevents them from showing up in AirDrop on my iPhone. Fortunately this works for me, since I typically AirDrop files to only one of my computers, and all of my computers are connected via Ethernet anyway, so WiFi is unnecessary for network connectivity. Is there a different way of either changing a computer's name or making it disappear entirely from AirDrop?\n\nA: You can opt out of AirDrop on a Mac quite easily.\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off WiFi\n\n*Use an OS X Profile to disable sharing via AirDrop (MDM such as OS X server.app's profile manager can do this easily)\n\n\nSetting the name should be easy to test. Open the sharing preference pane and make one Apple an Orange. Watch that the names change. If not, you've got a caching issue with your network and might want to power off all AppleTV and Airport devices at the same time to get a clean start to that cache. I haven't figured a more elegant way to purge the collective shared cache of bonjour names that works as well as a total outage there.\n\nA: For me just now using ios 10.3.2 and macos Sierra, changing the computer name in System Preferences -> Sharing worked great.

(I tried starting these emulators when the CD was already in the drive, no chance.)\n\nI believe I could go and buy one of these old clamshell Apple laptop that runs 8.2 but I'd like to do without.\nI also considered installing 8.0 with original install CDs into SheepShaver, but people online say Sheepshaver / Basilisk are usually touchy when it comes to recognise CD-ROMs.\nEDIT: \nHere's what fontographer does:\n\nEDIT (2): I found out how to solve this problem.\nHere's how: I created three read/write disk images, one for each install CD, using Disk Utility in OS X.\nThen using BasiliskII, I added each .dmg file to my preferences window. \nUpon restart, all three CDS showed up and could be used without the CD.\n(In my previous efforts, I had not tried to convert each CD into a .DMG file or didn't know how to add them as drives into Basilisk.)\nThanks for the help! Can someone please mark it as \"solved\" if you have clearance.\n\nA: You need to use a CD/DVD Authoring software like Toast to mount the image inside the emulated classic Mac (SheepShaver). The CD mounter that is built in is not good enough to trick software that looks for the original disk. Software like Toast Mounter can though.\n\nA: From your question, are you implying that OSX has no problem opening and reading the CD-ROM but then doesn't recognize the format of the font files?\nThe question I would have is what format is the CD-ROM? Is it ISO-9660 or some other format that perhaps needed a special driver back in the Mac OS days? I can't say I'm necessarily aware of the variations, but I struggle to think of why it wouldn't be recognized by the emulators if it was a standard format with appropriate drivers.\nThat all being said, if the problem is that you want to use the font files on the CD-ROM and OSX recognizes them, why not copy them to your OSX machine and then burn them to another CD? Better yet, I think you can access an OSX directory from Basilisk so why not just copy the files there?\n", "Q: Possible keylogger? How to remove?

The original HD is broken and can't be recovered.\n\n\nWhen I try to use the Mac OS X install DVD I get the following error:\n\nMac OS X can't be installed on this computer\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from your OS X Installer Disc. After the installer loads select your language and click on the Continue button.  When the menu bar appears select Disk Utility from the Utilities menu.\n\n*After DU loads select your hard drive (this is the entry with the mfgr.'s ID and size) from the left side list. Note the SMART status of the drive in DU's status area.  If it does not say \"Verified\" then the drive is failing or has failed and will need replacing.  SMART info will not be reported  on external drives. Otherwise, click on the Partition tab in the DU main window.\n\n*Under the Volume Scheme heading set the number of partitions from the drop down menu to one.

Click on the Apply button and wait until the process has completed.\n\n*Select the volume you just created (this is the sub-entry under the drive entry) from the left side list. Click on the Erase tab in the DU main window.\n\n*Set the format type to Mac OS Extended (Journaled.) Click on the Security button, check the button for Zero Data and click on OK to return to the Erase window.\n\n*Click on the Erase button.\nBut this didn't work for me.\n\nA: You don't indicate which OS X you are starting from, but your MacBook Pro shipped with Snow Leopard.\nOne course of action is to purchase the retail packaged Snow Leopard generic installation DVD and then the downloadable Lion from the Apple store for US$19.99 each. You will need to install Snow Leopard first from disc, update to 10.6.8, then download and install Lion. There are no Lion or later install DVDs available from Apple. \n\nA: Like the previous answers, if you would like to reinstall Snow Leaopard - Mountain Lion, you would need to purchase a new disk. If you would like to install Yosemite, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A working mac\n\n*A DVD Drive or an open USB Port\n\n*A blank DVD or USB Flash Drive\n\n\nThe following would only be necessary if you cannot find a way to open App Store, download Yosemite, and install it. The steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Yosemite onto the working mac\n\n*Follow these instructions for the basics on creating a boot disk, but you may want to use DiskMakerX as well.\n\n*Reboot your computer, and after the startup chime, immediately press and hold the option key until you see a set of disks. \n\n*Use the arrow keys to select the USB Disk or CD(not Recovey-HD or Macintosh HD)\n\n*Installing OS X is simple from there.\n\n\nA: You can use the soft DiskMakerX.... And create the installer with Mavericks or another OS X with a USB device and launch the installer in usb connect the device in a port of the mac and pressing alt when turn on your Mac, finally the os x\n\nA: If the disk is corrupt or wiped (no recovery partition, no time machine copy, etc.) then this will be more difficult. If your Mac is older than around 2012, then it will not have internet recovery mode either.  You really need the grey discs that came with your Mac.  If you don't have those, read on...\nHere are the steps to follow if you want to legally install Mac OS X on your hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase OS X 10.6 installation disks from Apple using this link: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard\n\n*Wait for the discs to show up in the mail.\n\n*When they do show up, insert the first disk. While powering up your mac, hold the C key until you are presented with an option of which disk to boot - select your DVD.\n\n*(Don't have a DVD drive? Then sorry, there is no legal way to install OS X on your computer.)\n\n*Once you have 10.6 installed, you can upgrade to 10.6.8 over the internet by going to the Apple icon and clicking on Software Update.\n\n*Once you have 10.6.8 you will have access to the App store, where you will be allowed to upgrade to the latest OS X version (Currently El Capitan), only if you have a valid Apple ID. You can only upgrade to the latest version, you cannot upgrade legally to any intermediate versions.\n\n\n(There is an exception to #6: if your Apple ID was used previously to upgrade to an intermediate version when that version was still available for download, you can go to your purchase history to access those versions, but only after you install from scratch to 10.6 using legal DVDs and then upgrade to 10.6.8 to activate the App Store)\nIf you just want the fastest sure fire way to just make your Mac work, and you don't care about legality or violating Apple's EULA, then what you want to do is obtain a bootleg bootable copy of Mac OS X from Usenet servers, torrent, etc.  You can get pretty much any OS X from 10.6 to 10.9 Mavericks as a bootleg bootable download.  Find a bootloeg version that comes as a .toast file and use TransMac or PowerISO to burn the .toast image to a burnable DVD, then use that DVD in your Mac and reboot your Mac while holding down the C key on your keyboard to boot from the DVD.  Just be sure the bootlegged copy says it's a bootable version.  No working Mac is required using this method, just a Windows PC with an internet connection and a DVD burner.\n\nA: You need to obtain a retail version of Snow Leopard. Apple still sells them or Ebay etc. After that is installed you can upgrade.\nRead this for more info: http://www.macworld.com/article/2101301/advice-from-an-apple-tech-how-to-get-old-mac-os-x-install-discs.html\n", "Q: Is there a way possible to make iPad sleep / wake at specific time intervals using Apple configurator?

Are they still in an old backup? I reset my iPhone 4 because it was terribly slow after 3 years of continuous usage.\nNow it's much faster again, but many of my contacts are lost, although I used to sync them using iCloud and I had them both on my phone and on my Mac. I tried to restore them using TimeMachine, but it seems there are no backups for contacts left from early enough.\nNow I wonder whether my contacts still are on an old iPhone backup (which I should have in iTunes from before resetting my iPhone) and so I could get them back.\nSo my question is: What could have happened that I lost most of my contacts? I indeed deleted a lot of contacts a few days ago, but I for sure didn't delete many of those that are gone, and many that I deleted, are back again.\n\nA: Not sure what happened but you should be able to restore your iPhone from within iTunes. Depending on when the backup was made that should have everything that was on your iPhone.\nIf you have no backups in iTunes that work you can check Time Machine for other backups:\n/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\nRestore your more recent backup to your local HD and then Option-Click on the restore from backup button in iTunes and select the file you just recovered.\nI am doing some of this from memory but that is the general idea.\n", "Q: Weird iMessage behavior on Yosemite Something weird is happening with iMessage on my Mac.

I'm going to be on an aircraft for a long time, but the aircraft offers an ethernet cable, which I can connect to my Macbook through a USB to ethernet cable, however, I would like to get internet access on my iPhone 5S. Is there any way to do this? Like through a lightning cable? Is there a cydia tweak for this? (I'm jailbroken)\n\nA: Sharing wifi to your phone is a piece of cake. Your computer just can't bridge a network. Go to System Preferences -> Sharing and enable the network. Then connect to it from your iPhone. \nTraveling on an airplane would not affect the performance of your computer's wifi, and yes, at least in the U.S., you are allowed to do that above 10,000' feet (although I've never seen them enforce it below). \nThe FAA has changed rules within the past years that require devices to be on airplane mode (no antennas activated) while below 10,000' but that isn't necessary above.

But why does the iPhone 6 have this Gap/Thick line on its edge? Any clue?\n\nA: Those are for the phones antennae (theres one towards the bottom of the phone as well).\nThe anodised aluminium causes really bad signal attenuation, hence the plastic-like strips are necessary to create a break in the metal shell.\nI decided to delve a bit further and found that Apple is trying to get rid of them.\n\nA: The reason is an antennae for the phone, since having a smooth iPhone would cause horrible and impossible coverage(quite literally). Since the iPhone has a lot of bands to cover as many network as possible, the \"split\" the metal back, and many of the strips on the device caused by this are the antenna.\n", "Q: Changing Word 2011 Save Location Drop-Down Menu Right now when I try to save a document the location options are simply: Documents, Pictures, Downloads, etc. and then \"Recent Locations\". I want to be able to browse through my documents for the correct folder to save to but I cannot figure out how to enable these feature. I just updated OS X and it disabled the \"browse\" feature.\n\nA: I think what you are looking for is the button that expands the save dialog to the expanded size.

Is it possible for me to keep iCloud Music Library turned on so I can actually use Apple Music (save tracks and playlists to the My Music playlist) while also maintaining the ability to sync any music I acquire the old-fashioned way (downloads, CDs, etc) and add to my iTunes library?\nIt's so damn annoying to have to turn on and off iCloud Music Library just to be able to sync music to my phone while using Apple Music.\n\nA: Ok, I think there is a way to do this, but it is not my preferred method.\nWhen you have iCloud Music Library turned on for your iPhone or iOS device, you will also need to make sure it is turned on for your iTunes library on the desktop. When you do so Apple automatically uploads your iTunes library to iCloud. Then, your iTunes library shows up on your iOS device. If you want to save those tracks locally, you must choose to do so within Apple Music on the device itself.\nBasically, Apple has done away with the idea of syncing your music locally through a USB cable, you must do it over the air via your data connection or WiFi. Kind of stupid that it has to go through Apple's iCloud servers first and then back to your device...\n\nA: I agree, this is a huge pain to manage and it has been bugging me ever since I turned it on.\nThat being said, I just tried this and it worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud Music Library on your iOS Device\n\n*Plug into your computer and sync playlists\n\n*Turn on iCloud Music Library on your iOS Device\n\n\nIt will not delete the playlists that are already there; they will be merged with your iCloud Playlists.\n\nA: Have you tried this?

We're sharing the same storage. My phone continually tells me that I don't have enough storage space. How do I remove my daughters contents off my phone and quit receiving her stuff from her phone?\n\nA: You should make an iCloud account to your daughter then link her phone to that new account from Settings -> iCloud.\nThen you can manage your iCloud storage from settings -> General -> Use -> iCloud -> Manage Storage and you will find everything fill your iCloud account and you can remove what you don't need to.\n\nA: If you would like to continue to use the sam Apple ID, go to Settings -> iTunes and App Store. you will see a list of 4 items under \"Automatic Downloads\". Uncheck all the content you do not want to sync to your device.

In fact, you can even use any of their purchases. To do that you need to have Family Sharing.\nGo to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088 to setup Family Sharing.\n\nA: In short, no. Apple does not let people from different iTunes accounts sync music to the same device. Only devices registered with a specific Apple ID can get iCloud music from that Apple ID. However, if the music is from a CD or non-iTunes store source, it is unsigned and the raw .mp4 files can be transferred from iTunes to iTunes.

Note that I cannot reproduce the freeze.\nSome info: I have a Early 2013 15 inch MBP running 10.10.4.\n\nA: I had the same exact problems with my 2010 iMac 21.5 running 10.10.4. \nOpen up Activity Monitor and have it run behind you to check memory pressures and CPU usage. My guess would be your RAM is overloaded, so it cannot make any changes to your system. \nDownloading the trial version of CleanMyMac 3 lets you have a nice little memory checker in your status bar. I would recommend (since you cannot upgrade RAM) look for software to optimize your memory usage or alert you when you use too much so you can close needed applications. The internet is full of guides to help lower RAM usage.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Mac OS install drive not being recognized by computer I recently installed Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) onto an external USB drive.

(period) and \\ (backslash). Every other character seems to work fine (e.g. !, @, %, ? ...) though I did not do an exhaustive check as the ascii character space.\n\nA: I had this exact same problem with the \"SDSharePointBrowser::handleOpenCallBack returned 65\" error in the console. To fix it, I enabled, and then disabled, SMB and AFP file sharing in System Preferences.

I'm not sure about the science behind this, but for some reason I can set the wireless mode to 11bgn mixed, channel width to auto when I choose channel 11 (and my iphone with iOS 9.3 beta 5 won't disconnect).\nEnable WMM was unchecked with these 3 options, but alone it didn't work.\n\nA: I the same problem and got solved after unplugging and reseting everything connected to the router, it was an ip conflict between my iphone and a previously DHCP set domotic controller.\nIt may sound silly, but forgot to check the ip addresses of every device.\n\nA: I had similar problem with a resurrected iPhone 5 and TP-Link Archer C3200.  Although I have quite a lot of other working devices - iPhone 4s, iPhone 6s, Sony Vaio, MacBook Pro, MacMini, Asus Chi T300, Chromebook, Sony Smart TV, Samsung smart TV, you name it...  \nThe iPhone 5 will connect to WiFi with no problem, it just wont connect to any internet sites via Safari or any apps.  After banging my head against this for many hours, including Googling and trying different suggestions such as those offered here to no effect, I finally noticed that my router is assigning an IP address to the iPhone via DHCP that is already given to another computer via DHCP!  I wonder how this could even be possible? Bug in router firmware? \nSo to work around the issue, I use the router's web admin interface to lock down another IP address based on the phone's MAC address - and voila! The iPhone 5 can now surf the web with ease.\n\nA: Thanks God After Changing high power to low power mode (19dbm) its working iphone uses 2.5ghz to connect to any phone while we use high power its move to 5ghz on high power so change the high power to low power in wireless basic setting thanks\n\nA: Pulling my hair out over my old ipads not connecting to my new TP-Link Archer. What worked for me was to set the 2.5ghz to WEP security, even though my old Billion was WPA2 and the ipads had no issue before.  Not ideal but it works.\n\nA: 1) changed channel to 11\n2) disabled QSS\n3) disabled WMM\nPROFIT!!!\nThank you all\n", "Q: Automator: Get filename I'm creating a folder action to display a notification when a new file is downloaded and would like the notification to display the filename.

Unfortunately, something in the Galaxy sets off the Apple Pay on the iPhone when they're in the same pocket, and it constantly shows the credit card. Normally I wouldn't care, but this accelerates battery drain as the screen is on far more often.\nIs there some software way to address this in either device?\n\nA: Apple Pay works with NFC \"Near Field Communication\" band at 13.56 Mhz (but in low energy) means it has to be very close to the source to work).\nYou iPhone gets a interference signal (not intended) from Samsung and it thinks it is near a payment machine and it activates.\nSince it is a interference, there is no software that can fix that, it is a hardware issue (shielding).\n(BT and WiFi) or keep them apart.\nSo your choices are, turn off the Apple Pay, turn off the Samsung payment feature, or keep them apart.\nEdit: upon closer exam of the \"Samsung Galaxy s6\" model it shows to have the NFC capability, that would also explain the interference.  (and you may be able to solve the problem by turning the Samsung's payment feature off.)\n\nA: It's fairly easy to turn off the NFC capabilities on your Android (simply go to your pull down menu or settings and click the icon to turn it off. Here is a link to a video example).\nThis should stop it from communicating with your iPhone and not cause any troubles with your Apple Pay.\nIn terms of software for this, there are some 'If This, Then That' types of applications on the market. I do not have any experience with any in particular, but you could possibly set it up (on either phone) to recognize one phone's NFC and then force it not to communicate to the other or to turn off the NFC on one phone during certain hours, etc. \nHope this helps! If all else fails, just try keeping the phones in separate pockets seeing as the NFC requires the phones to be in very close proximity of one another.\n", "Q: Installing iOS 9 public beta (pb) 3 with iTunes On OS X I run iTunes (12.2.1.16)\nI keep going from iOS 9 beta 3 back to iOS 8.4 due to finding glitches. Because of this I have to keep waiting for ~20mins for iOS 9pb1 to download. Is there a way to download the IPSW so I can doit within iTunes to skip the waiting time?  \nTo get iOS PBs I had to enrol my device by installing a profile. After I done that I then updated OTA via System > General > Software Update.\n\nA: I would try again with the latest public beta - for many reasons in addition to being a more stable installation experience. \nIf you have access to a developer certificate/account, the quickest way forward is to log in to developer.apple.com and download the beta build 13A4325c then point iTunes to it for the restore.\nSince you have the other method to install the beta - using a signed profile to change the provisioning of the device OTA, you have a longer road ahead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait it out (bad advice, but if you have time...)\n\n*Wipe the device after backing it up, place it in recovery mode and restore from iTunes. Then re-enroll in betas and hope you are on a fast network next download. Also, be sure the date/time are correct on the device before enrolling the profile.\n\n", "Q: What's a more graceful way to hide private information during a live demo Sometimes I give live demos from my Macbook, whereby I plug in an HDMI cable and show my screen on a projector.\nDuring such demos, I sometimes might need to look up a login password which I keep stored in an encrypted file.\nWhat's a better way besides unplugging the monitor to privately copy this password into the pasteboard without flashing my entire password file on the big screen?\n\nA: You could hit Command + F1 which toggles display mirroring.

Any help/suggestions?\n\nA: Apple has removed the track number feature from the Music app and it is not known if or when it will return.\n\nA: When there are more than 15 new and excellent changes in the new music app and great upgrades still waiting, no one is caring for a option which shows track number.\nThe Apple Music doesn't have the track number feature because it can then update Albums with no remix tracks.\nEvery album has got some songs and they also add some remixed versions of the songs to the album itself.Some call them as Deluxe versions while some add them in original album as well.\nIn Apple music, at present doesn't allow the remixed tracks to be streamed ( maybe later ) So in order to not have a contradiction with the Track number, they removed the option.\n", "Q: Recording direct from camera into MacBook Pro via HDMI? Is there any way to 'tether' my camera via its HDMI out to a MacBook pro? \nThe goal is to record live, uncompressed, video direct from a camera. Thus skipping the camera's file system and recording directly onto the Mac's hard drive via Premier Pro or similar software. \n\nA: This is how it works for me camera's HDMI -> Mac's USB but it requires a special device:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Panasonic HC-V777 camera which has a micro HDMI output (the micro HDMI - HDMI cabel is provided with the camera out of the box).\n\n*I have a Corsair Elgato HD60 S capture device which has 2 HDMIs: input and output. Also it provides an output port and a cable that connects HD60 to my Macbook's USB.\n\n*I connect my camera to HD60 which connects the camera to the USB.\n\n*OBS Studio is software that works on macOS and is HD60-friendly: it supports a special adapter that makes it possible to both record and stream the input from the camera coming to HD60 from the camera's micro HDMI.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of this approach is the need in the extra device (HD60 S) and also this device requires output to go somewhere otherwise the capture does not work. I connect it to the second monitor where I see the output from my camera that is passed through the HD60.\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro HDMI port is output only. \nSo no, you can not use it as input for your recording.\nYour alternatives are USB 3 or Thunderbolt.\n\nA: you need a hub that captures like USB Capture HDMI Magewell \n\nA: Trying to figure this out also - BUT with HDMI to Firewire...looks like I may need an additional adapter of male Firewire IEEE connection to female HDMI  \nI do have a FireWire 800 hook up on the back of my 2010 iMac to to my DVR (Firewire IEEE 1394 input) using a cable like this https://www.amazon.com/Clear-IEEE-1394-Firewire-Cable/dp/B00699GJW4 - The one I picked up was a Belkin about 6 years ago.

I have a MacBook Pro Retina 13\" (Late 2013) with 16 GB RAM/512 GB SSD running Mac OS X 10.10.3. There are 20 GB free space on the SSD according to the Finder.\nDespite the relatively huge amount of available disk space I constantly get the \"Your startup disk is almost full\" alert after waking up the MacBook from sleep. I can then observe in the Finder that only approx. 100-300 MB are available in that very moment, but that within seconds space is freed again, though not the entire space (for example 6 GB become available). It requires a restart/reboot to make the entire 20 GB to reappear.\nI'm a hardcore Safari user (a dozen windows open with 1 to 25 tabs in each) and also have ten thousands of mails in my 10 email accounts in Mail.app. I'm also aware that Mail.app retrieves mails while the MacBook is closed, yet I still can't believe that this is what eats up all the disk space. The interesting point is that it only gets dramatically low during/after sleep. When actively using the machine the free space decreases, but never to that degree that the said alert pops up.\nI got the strange feeling that one of the various extensions might be the responsible resource hog. How can I nail down who or which app (or if Safari: exactly which browser tab) is responsible for this? Exactly how and where to look in Activity Monitor!?\nSwap files? Uhm, yes... But which app and why during sleep!?\nJust learned about the existence of a \"Sleep image\" which likely is to save the state in case the machine runs entirely out of power. Still I'm worried about a memory leak as there is dramatically less space available after a while of using the machine compared to the situation after any reboot.\n\nA: The purpose of the sleepimage is to store the contents of RAM if your Macbook's battery is low and is about to turn off completely (what Apple call \"hibernate\"). As such it can be equal in size to the amount of RAM in your Mac. So on your Macbook with 16GB of RAM it could be 16GB in size, which would go a long way to explaining how your Mac with 20GB of free space could quickly fill up. You can check the size of the sleepimage by typing ls -lh /private/var/vm/sleepimage in the Terminal. You can also delete it at any time with sudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage as your Mac will just recreate it as needed.\nAbout your Safari use... \"a dozen windows open with 1 to 25 tabs in each\"...\nHave you heard the famous joke about the guy who goes to his Doctor and says \"My arm really hurts when I do this\" and his Doctor says \"Well, don't do that.\"?\nThere is another slightly less famous joke about a guy who goes to his Apple Genius and says \"My Mac really hurts when I open over a hundred tabs in Safari.\" and his Apple Genius says \"Well don't open over a hundred tabs in Safari.\"\nI might have made that last one up, but it sounds like good advice. You might want to get into the habit of closing tabs and using a bookmarking service like Pinboard or Instapaper.\nIf you have 16GB of RAM and the most commonly used applications on your Macbook are Safari and Mail, your Mac shouldn't be using a significant amount of swap files. Unless of course you have 100+ tabs open in Safari. You can check the amount and size of swapfiles on your Macbook with ls -lh /private/var/vm/ in a Terminal window. Note that they are in the same place as the sleepimage, but you can't delete them. If you reboot your Macbook it should clear them up itself.\nSomething else to try is running Etrecheck on your Macbook. It will identify a lot of the third-party extensions/plugins on your Mac, including Internet plugins. I'd start with removing the ones you no longer need or don't recognise.\n", "Q: Open Preview for iPhone and SD card Is there a way to automatically open Preview whenever I plug my iPhone in my Mac to import the photos? Also want to do this when connecting my Nikon SD card. I just hate this new Photos app, I prefer to use Preview to import.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect your phone.\n\n*Open Image Capture from your Applications folder.\n\n*In the bottom-left corner of the Image Capture window, select \"Preview\" where it says \"Connecting this iPhone opens:\"\n\n*Repeat while your Nikon SD card is connected.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Setting to stop opening a new instance of an already open application? On my iMac this works perfectly. I have application open, I open a file extension handled by that application and it will open in the already open application. Just got a new Macbook Pro and each time I open a file it will open the same application again.\nExamples:\nI open an HTML file in Sublime Text 2, instead of using the application that is already open like on my iMac, it opens in it's own Sublime Text 2. Doesn't matter how many files I open. Each time it will open a new application.\nClick a link from an email? New Chrome window will launch. I have Chrome open already, but it will open a new window every time. Double click an HTML file on the desktop? New Chrome window. \nVery annoying so what is the setting I need to check that will stop this behavior and always open in the already open instance of the application?\n\nA: If you are saying that you want each double-click to open the new file in a new tab of the current Sublime window, rather than opening a new window in Sublime, then that is going to be an application-specific preference.  Meaning, you'll need to look at the preferences for Sublime and see if there isn't some equivalent of \"Open new file in tab\" or \"Open new window in new tab\" setting.\n\nA: I wonder if you need to set file associations for some file types on the new MBP? some of the defaults are probably different than on you trusty iMac. You can check each file by hitting command-I in Finder with the file highlighted. Here is an explanation: http://osxdaily.com/2013/08/08/change-default-application-open-files-mac-os-x/\nEach file type has a default application that is associated with it. This means that when you double-click a file from the Finder it will open a specific application, for example on a fresh Mac OS X installation, all image files (png, jpg, gif, pdf, etc) will default to opening in Preview, and all text documents (txt, rtf, etc) will open in TextEdit. Over time, the default applications and file associations can change as you install more applications, which sometimes set themselves as the new default app to open a file format with.\n", "Q: How do I save a contact to a specific iCloud account? I have multiple account sources for my Contacts (family iCloud, personal iCloud, Exchange, etc.) When I create a new contact, how do I specify what account I want it saved to? Right now, Contacts just saves it to the default account.\nI'm on the latest Yosemite.\n\nA: Short answer, you cannot change it on the fly on a per entry basis.  You have to set the default account in the preferences for contacts.app. However, when in Contacts, and you have a card open (perhaps the one you JUST made), pressing the OPTION key will highlight all the groups on the left side of the app that include this card.  When you have your list of cards showing on the right with the accounts or groups showing on the left, you can simply drag that entry to the group or account of your choosing. This is the only method I'm aware of.\n", "Q: dtrace replacement for fseventer? I think many of us have been disappointed with the effective demise of fseventer.  What is a good dtrace shell based alternative to fseventer that will display all full paths of files being accessed for a defined application?\n\nA: They're not quite a 100% fit, but if you'd like to monitor file access for an application I find a combination of opensnoop and fs_usage works well. Only opensnoop uses DTrace though.\n\nA: The command below finds files that have been modified recently. (It's not what the OP asked but it's mostly what I used fseventer for.)\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSContentChangeDate>$time.now(-300)'\n\nmdimport -A lists the names of other metadata attributes.\nkMDItemContentModificationDate is taken from EXIF data for files that have EXIF data.

What would be the 'best' way to connect the 2015 Retina MacBook Pro to a Dell U2715H monitor? If I wanted to use the monitors USB 3.0 ports and also output sound to a Dell soundbar, how many cables would I need?\nI was previously considering getting a Thunderbolt Display, but the reasons against are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bigger and heavier than the Dell\n\n*Ugly wide bezels \n\n*Twice as expensive as the Dell \n\n*Uses more power than the Dell\n\n\nI do wonder what functionality I'll lose though. Will I end up having to (dis)connect HDMI, USB and audio each time I (un)dock the laptop?\nWould I connect the MacBook to the display using some sort of adapter, or just the HDMI port? UPDATE: The U2715H doesn't support 2560x1440 over HDMI, only using the MiniDP connection.\n\nA: Do NOT use the HDMI video output!\nPlease buy a Mini DisplayPort cable connect your MacBook and U2715H.\n\nA: The Dell monitor came with a Mini DP connector, which was all that was needed to carry the image. It also came with a USB connector, which has then allowed me to use the Dell soundbar.\nThe font smoothing on the Dell is not as good as on an official Apple monitor, which is somewhat annoying as the hardware is the same, it's a software problem. When dragging a window from the laptop screen to the Dell screen, you see OSX change the algorithm it's using to something more rubbish.\n\nA: U2715H has support for 2560x1440 over HDMI — tested with MacBook Pro Retina with NVIDIA 750M.\n", "Q: Initialize Time Machine backup without clicking the menu bar icon Is there a way to start 'Backup now' without going to System Preferences, enabling Time Machine Menu bar and clicking it if I have the icon hidden?\nClicking on the drive doesn't let me backup:\n\n\nA: tmutil is a command line utility for \"controlling and interacting with Time Machine.\" Try man tmutil.

It takes me 25-30 sec. Apple refused my app because they claim after the first minute content is still not loaded. Do you know do they test app during low network conditions on purpose? Apps should be responsive even in offline mode?\n\nA: I don't believe that the majority of app reviews would enable Network Link Conditioner or test the app on an intentionally hobbled network.\nGiven the extra time that would add to the review cycle and how much time it takes for the mandatory issues, I believe that Apple's role isn't a performance tester and would expect user reviews and the developer to test adequately for network errors.\nYes - I would bet that some of the best testers test for no network condition from time to time when their intuition shows that the app is marketed in that respect or if they are looking for a reason to push a build back to the developer, but my hunch is that this isn't the typical testing workflow at present.\nI think it's awesome that they noticed your current incarnation of server side content deployment resulted in a delay to the user. Did they ask you to look at using their solution for App Slicing and on-demand resources so that your apps not only installed quickly, but were useful at first launch and then could retrieve assets from Apple's CDN rather than from your servers directly?\n", "Q: Change information of music files I tried to change the information (cover, album, artist, etc.) of some songs, just double clicking on \"information\" of any file. I can't change any of them in this way, even if I enter like admin; the only way to change the information is with iTunes, but the information changed is not changed in the user directory.\nWhen I try to play a song with iTunes, automatically any songs are copied in Music → iTunes → iTunes Media → Music. Even if I delete the music files in my user folder, they remain inside the iTunes directory.\nWhy does this happen? Doesn't make more sense that iTunes copy the link instead than all the file? In this way 2 copies of each files remain on the machine and the memory will be full before for no reason.\nHow can I change the information on each song in my user folder if double clicking on \"information\" of any file doesn't change anything?\n\nA: When you import a file into iTunes and have the option \"Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\" it will create a copy and place it into iTunes media folder. You can then delete the original if desired because a copy was made. If you do not have that option checked it will not copy the file.\nThe reason editing the song info does not affect the file in your user folder is you are actually editing the one that was copied/imported into the iTunes Media folder.\n", "Q: OS X Mail App - How to send an email at a specific date and time Just for my curiosity and knowledge, is there any way to create different emails and have them delivery automatically at a specific date and time?\nAs provider I do use iCloud.com and Gmail.com and I have OS X 10.10 Mail App. \n\nA: There is a plugin for mail SendLater unfortunately it costs money.

As of last night however, after the update downloaded in Firefox the Thunderbolt camera and audio are no longer recognized, only FaceTime HD is listed. I can get a video feed only when I open up the laptop.\nThe audio option from my displays is also gone from the list in Adobe. In Google Chrome, the Adobe room video dropdown option box essentially says, \"No camera available\" - so in Chrome it does not even recognize the MacBook Pro's camera as available. I usually use Firefox, and have never had problems until last night's update.\nBottom line, my MacBook Pro no longer seems to recognize that the Thunderbolt displays have a camera and audio feed available. Can someone help me to fix this please?\n\nA: FOUND THE SOLUTION!\nOpen Terminal and type:\nsudo killall VDCAssistant\n\nCamera works now!\n\nA: This might be the reason.\nMozilla blocks Flash in Firefox browser as Adobe issues emergency patch for latest security exploits as of  July 14, 2015 / 8:15 am    \nWhile the block doesn’t completely prevent Firefox users from using Flash, it does mean users will have to actively click-to-enable the plugin. \n\nA: I had the same issue with Macbook Pro (late 2020) running Catalina.\nI installed this Driver: https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/file?id=1636\nThen I checked the Allowed box in the camera screentime settings in Mac preferences to make sure the camera was enabled to always allow. It wasn't selected so this could have been the standalone fix without the driver.\nEither way, the external display works now.\n", "Q: How does my Selfie Stick take a picture using the *headphone socket*? I just got a selfie stick, and it connects to my iPhone via the headphone socket.\nClicking a button on the stick causes a picture to be taken.\nI'm wondering how that actually works. If the headphone socket is an output, how is the stick sending an input, and that too to take a picture?\nDoes the headphone socket have some sort of input 'mechanism' the stick uses??\n\nA: iOS implements a feature to allow the user to take a photo by pressing the volume up/down button on the earphone remote. The selfie stick simply recreates this button press by shorting out pin 4 (microphone) and pin 3 (ground).\n\nA: Short answer: Your selfie stick is pretending to be a set of iPhone headphones and pressing the button on your stick is actually the same as pressing the volume up or down button which captures a photo. You can do the same with normal iPhone headphones, or by pressing the physical button on your iPhone.\n\nDetailed answer:\nNote: +(ve) and -(ve) refers to positive and negative respectively.\nDepending on the model of iPhone you have, most modern iPhones since the iPhone 3GS have the ability to control the the volume of audio playback through the remote built in-line in compatible headphones.\nThe headphone jack on a typical music device would be either TS (mono) or TRS (stereo), meaning that it has a Tip section, Ring section and a Sleeve section.\n\nHeadphones are essentially speakers, and like most electrical devices they work on the idea of a circuit, from +(ve) to -(ve), so a stereo set of headphones is basically two speakers. One for each the left and right channels, so you need two wires, one for each, and a third that connects both back to the -(ve) side of the circuit. Thats why a stereo headphone jack is TRS (Tip, Ring, Sleeve).\nThe tip section of a headphone jack is always the left channel (or mono), the 1st ring section is the right channel, and the sleeve section is the -(ve) connection, this sleeve being -(ve) is important for later...\nEven since the original iPhone there has always been a remote control inline with the right ear bud, and a microphone also. This allowed you to pickup calls hands-free and also play/pause, skip and rewind tracks by clicking the button.\n\nTo implement these extra features required a special type of headphone jack, a TRRS (Tip, Ring, Ring Sleeve) jack, it's no bigger than a normal jack and whats really clever is that the additional ring is in the section where the sleeve would be on a normal headphone.\nThe reason this is clever is that when you use your TRRS type headphones on a device which is a normal music player, the microphone bit just gets connected to -(ve) and is thus essentially disabled but the left and right channels are connected as normal so your smart iPhone headphones become normal headphones without any chance of the microphone or buttons becoming a problem.\n\nAnyway, back to the original question, using some (to the non-layperson) basic electronics the extra Ring section can be used to send electrical pulses that send the volume up/down and play/pause buttons and microphone through this channel.\nSince iOS 6, you have been able to use the volume up (and later down) button(s) on your iPhone, or headphones to capture a photo. This was in response to a number of third-party photo apps that popped up adding this feature with ever increasingly clever ways of hiding this from Apple's App Store reviewers.\nSo essentially the selfie stick is pretending to be a pair of Apple Headphones and pressing the volume up or down buttons. You can probably verify this by going into the Music app and pressing the capture button.\n", "Q: Different owners of apps in /Applications depending on installation technique I have noticed that pre-installed as well as apps installed from the App Store located in /Applications show permissions like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x+  3 root     wheel  102 Jan  1  2014 Mail.app\nwhereas apps installed by drag-and-drop into the same folder look like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 johndoe  admin  102 Jan  1 15:55 Steam.app\nWhy do these apps depending on the installation technique get assigned different owners and groups? I am using a standard user account for installation (johndoe) if that's important. Also, why would it be a bad idea to change the owner of every app to root as is mentioned for example in Homebrew's FAQs:\n\nDid you chown root /Applications/TextMate.app? Probably not.\n\n-- Homebrew FAQs\n\nA: If an app is digitally signed, then the owner will be assigned to the System. As this is a requirement for apps distributed through the Mac App Store, then the apps that you see from there will likely be owned by the system and not you.\nWith apps that you download directly from a vendor, then they may or may not digitally sign their apps, in which case upon installation, you may or may not be the owner. Digital signing provides different privileges to how the app can interact with parts of the OS, like getting beyond the firewall without an annoying popup to the user every time, so you may see even developer downloaded apps signed.\nBe careful of taking ownerships of signed apps, as this can corrupt the digital signature and you may be force to reinstall the app.\n", "Q: Applescript: Duplicate selection (folder) to desktop and moving the folder to a different location First of, i'm an applescript noob;-)  What I'm asking for is simple but nearly impossible for me to execute.

I've tried removing the password from Keychain, repairing Disk Permissions, and completely removing all of my Mail data, but Mail still forgets my password immediately. Authentication doesn't even succeed once.\nHow can I get Mail to remember my SMTP password? I'd rather not completely reset my Keychain, so I'm looking for any other suggestions.\n\n\nA: I'm experiencing a similar issue. I've been doing some reading throughout the morning, and one possible solution I've found was covered here: http://osxdaily.com/2015/07/05/resolving-mail-problems-os-x-update/\nDisabling 'automatically detect and maintain settings' seems to have cleared it up for me, however I'm not 100% sure that this will be your solution, as your screenshot shows that box already unchecked.\n\nA: I've seen this happen when the keychain file gets corrupted.  From 10.9, the mail passwords are not stored in the normal login keychain, but in a host-specific database file (related to the iCloud keychain syncing; but, it happens even if you don't use iCloud).\nIn your ~/Library/Keychains/(UUID-UUID-UUID)/ directory, you may have a keychain2.db-corrupt file.  (UUID is the UUID of the Mac you're using).  If this is the case, restoring keychain2.db from a backup should fix your trouble.\n", "Q: How much RAM does the 6th generation iPod touch have?

Just a few days ago ( I have actually been using another computer for a while ) I started up my 2006  macbook pro and and after a few minutes I got the white diagonal lines, although I could still see the desktop pic with the top menu and dock but hitting keys did nothing.\nWell after a few more startups in the last few days, that desktop disappeared with just the white lines across a grey screen, then the next start up the apple logo had diagonal lines and then black lines and just now I fired it up again and I got the black lines and then right to the grey screen.\nI've seen this issue posted about before and I cannot remember what it means and I hope it is fixable.\nIt's a 2006 15\" MacBook Pro. I had the video chip replaced a few years back.\nSo, cuz it's 9 years old and otherwise works perfectly - except that I am maxed out at OSX 10.6.8 - I wonder if it is worth fixing - depending on what needs to be done.\nIf it's the hard drive, I am wondering if it is worth removing it and replacing with a solid state?\nAny thoughts? O and previous to this the start up sound was like a car battery that was almost dead when you start it up. really slow.\n\nA: Sounds very much like the graphics chip is on the blink again, it's pretty common to see these units fail again and again...\nUnfortunately you won't be able to get it serviced any more as it's classified as obsolete by Apple now so no parts are available, although maybe eBay etc...\nThere is a chance you could do an OS reinstall to verify it's a hardware fault and not software, but the diagonal lines is symptomatic of a hardware graphics chip issue like you would see on this range of machine.\nI would be looking to replace the machine at this point sadly. It might be worth going to the manager in an Apple Store and indicating that it's failed for a known fault again and asking if they would give a discount on a new machine as they may well do this as a gesture of good will.\n", "Q: How do you delete an unwanted album in the Photos app on an iMac?

For example right now I was downloading 35MB file (500KB/s download speed) and the speed went to 0KB/s like 5 times or so, so I had to turn off Wi-Fi on MBP and turn it on again. Then the speed went to 0 and I had to do the same. Same problem occurs when I'm browsing - out of nowhere Safari stops loading pages and I need to wait for like 30 seconds until the wi-fi starts working again or I need to turn off and on wi-fi on MBP.\nWhat I tried:\nTurning off wi-fi and deleting these files:\ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n com.apple.network.identification.plist\ncom.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist \nNetworkInterfaces.plist \npreferences.plist\nfrom /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\nIt didn't help. I also tried to forget the network I was currently on and connect to it again, but that didn't work either. Atm I don't have a possibility to check how my MBP works on other Wi-Fi networks. I've installed the latest version of Yosemite.\n\n\nA: Usually when the WiFi connection is still active but no data is flowing indicates Chanel crowding (to many devices/users on same channel).\nIf the WiFi is disconnecting that could be number of other reasons.

This is indicated by the fact the Menu Bar at the top is sold rather than translucent.\nIn the disabled mode you'll find which ever screen is allocated as the primary display in System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement will have all of the OS related GUI on it, i.e. the Menu Bar, Dock, and other system level interactions will only show on that screen.\n\nAnswer\nYou can change your application switcher with Witch to allow more Windows like window switching rather than application switching.

Unfortunately, that's what I need as I have not knowledge of any of the required software/firmware or OS's in general.\nI'm running OS X 10.10.3 with bootcamp v 5.1.4 and I also have virtualbox 4.3.28\nI have ownership of a copy of windows 8.1 student from the microsoft store but the only thing I've been able to download there is an .exe file.\nI think the problem is that I don't have a bootable usb or iso from which to boot. Is there any way for me to install windows on my machine?\nAlso, what would be better for uses like CAD on the windows partition: virtualbox or bootcamp. I'm running entirely on a solid state drive (MB pro) so rebooting isn't a huge issue but I wonder if it's worth it in terms of performance to use bootcamp.\nSorry for the long-winded two part question.\n\nA: With just having an .exe file you'll need to run that under Windows to create either an USB Installer or an ISO Image or both as they can be used for either Boot Camp or in a VM using VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop or VirtualBox.\nTo install in a VM you can use an ISO Image.\nTo install using Boot Camp Assistant and creating a USB Installer you need an ISO Image to create the USB Installer if the one created under Windows will not work.\nIf your Mac has an Optical Drive a DVD can be used, creating it from the ISO Image.\n\nA: I would reckoned running boot camp to take full control of your machine, but with the proper VB settings, you could optimize it to be near perfect. \nAs for the first question, the only possible way to boot camp it would be to burn the ISO to a disk or USB flash drive. You would achieve this by inserting the blank media and then opening disk utitiliy and burn the ISO to the disk. Making the USB bootable can be achieved by a quick google. \nHowever, VB does not require a physical boot disk. Set up the VB like you would for a DVD. But instead of booting up, go to that virtual machines settings and go to storage. Press the add putt on at the bottom right of the storage tree and add your ISO. Bow you can boot as normal and it will work.  \n", "Q: Device Emulation for testing We have a web design agency and we're wanting to test development on an ipad air 2, we have a couple of ipads that we often test our builds on but of course new devices are being regularly being brought to the market that feature newer technology, higher resolution screens etc. and it becomes counterintuitive to possess an endless array of older and new devices for testing on.\nSo, my question is, what are the currently available services, paid or otherwise, for Apple device emulation?\n\nA: I suggest getting Xcode on to your machine. Of course, you don't need to use Xcode itself, but you can use a companion app (it's bundled with Xcode) called iOS Simulator. They have a Safari app that you can open your webpage in.\nAnd, it's free.\n", "Q: Photos section of OSX Yosemite file picker dialog out of date -- any way to force an update? On my MacBook Pro running 10.10.4, just now, I wanted to upload an image to a website that I was browsing in Safari, so I clicked an upload field and got the usual dropdown Finder dialog. I choose \"Photos\" in the left sidebar to browse my Photos Library.\nI open the \"Moments\" section to look for a photo I took yesterday. The photo's not there. In fact, the whole \"moment\", comprising 16 photos, is missing. I open the Photos app to confirm that the moment is on my laptop, and it is.\nSo for some reason the Finder dialog lags behind the Photos app. Is there any way to \"kick\" it and prompt it to update? Or better yet, to eliminate the delay completely?\n\nA: I just had the same problem. It may seem that the fact that I have my Photos library on an external drive causes it.\nIn Apple Photos, I saw in the Preferences dialog (tab General) a button \"use as System library\". Pushing that solved my issue.\n", "Q: How do I undo deleting my bluetooth device from my macbook bluetooth device list? I accidentally deleted my bluetooth speakers from my macbooks devices list. Now it will not show up again. How can I get it to show up again so I can reconnect it?\n\nA: Also, most Bluetooth speakers have a pairing routine that will usually be initiated right after turning on, or by keeping the power / pair / connect / play button pressed for a while —which specific button will depend on your speaker make and model; either explore a bit, or find the manual.\n\nA: In System Preferences under 'Bluetooth', try turning Bluetooth off and then on again. Under 'Devices' your Mac should start discovering Bluetooth devices within range (make sure you are within range of your speakers when you do this).\nIf that doesn't work, make sure your speakers are connected to power or that their batteries are new/charged.\n\nA: I had the same exact problem as you. If you have wireless headphones what you want to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you turn off your headphones\n\n*Turn off all bluetooth devices\n\n*If it is a headphone like Beats Solo 3 you want to hold the power button for about 4 secs.\n\n*Turn your bluetooth device back on, and on your Mac and it should show up for pairing under devices.\n\n", "Q: Earphone security risk Can plugging public earphones in our iPhone 5's audio jack pose any security risk? Can our data (pictures, videos) be accessed? How often one can try a unknown earphone into iPhone 5c's audio jack in term of security and privacy risk?\n\nA: There is no security risk. That is only audio and no data access is possible.\nBut there maybe some health concerns if using previously used earphone that are not sterilized. Whipping them with a germs killer wet-tissue or alcohol should do it.\n", "Q: Will my pictures be erased if I restart my iPod? I need to know if my pictures are going to be erased if I restart my iPod.\n\nA: Only restarting you iPod will not erase your pictures. But for your Convenience you can plugin in you iPod on your computer or mac and make a backup with iTunes.\nIt you reset your iPod than your data will be lost. So make a backup with iTunes before.\n", "Q: Unable to pair again bluetooth headset I used to have a this bluetooth (BT) headset paired and working. Because it had some audio stuttering issues, as a troubleshooting measure I decided to un-pair (remove from list of BT devices in Mac OS) and pair again.\nThe problem is that now the headset is not seen anymore. I have the headset in pairing mode and the BT preferences window open and there's no way it'll show. Other BT devices show, and I can pair the BT headset with other devices.\nUsing Mac OS 10.10.4.\nHow to pair the headset again? Thanks!\n\nA: OK, I got this idea: maybe it's the headset that is preventing the pairing from happening (remember I removed the pairing on the Mac, but on the headset it might still be somehow locked with the previous pairing for this specific device). When I read the manual a while ago I remember there was a way to clear the pairing settings.\nSo I did that, and voilá!, I can now pair with the Mac again :-)\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem by deleting paired devices from \n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\n\nEdit with TextMate com.apple.Bluetooth.plist like this:\nLine with PairedDevices = ( \"00-00-00-XX-XX-XX\" ); change to PairedDevices = ( ); (X can be any letter or number).\n", "Q: Apple Music - Some sounds from Album are not available to download or listen I have Apple Music 3 month free trial and I added an album to my iCloud Music Library. But one sound is \"disabled\" and I cannot listen or download it. What's wrong?\n\nA: I'm not sure what the reason is behind this, or if it's a bug. But generally I've had this occur when I either previously owned that song or uploaded it, or if I downloaded that song as a single (I.e. Free single of the week, etc.).\nEither way, removing the entire album and any duplicate versions of that song, and then re-adding the album usually fix it for me. Best of luck!\n", "Q: What does the CLEAN badge mean in iTunes? I noticed an indication 'CLEAN' on iTunes today. What does it mean?\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: It is opposite to the Explicit version of a song, which may contain profanity or other unacceptable language. I do assume these don't have bad words in the text, etc. Unlike Explicit, which are more \"clean\" from author's point of view — they aren't \"beeped\" over phrases inappropriate before certain ages.\nBTW there are several threads on Apple.com about people losing their Explicit versions after Music Match, just because songs are the same but Apple hasve a Clean version of it. \n\nA: Is there perhaps an EXPLICIT version? Then this would indicate it's the PG version.\n\nA: If that is the case that there is an \"Explicit\" version of a song and a \"Clean\" version. Makes me wonder what Kenny Loggins might be thinking that the Essential Kenny Loggins are all listed as \"Clean.\"\n", "Q: My SD card is not showing up in Finder I have a SD card that I put into my MacBook Pro. It then showed up in finder. I wanted to access it and I accidentally dragged the mounted card and now it's gone from Finder.\nTaking out the card and inserting it again, didn't help. How can I find my SD card drive again?\n\nA: I found that removing the SD card, then restarting, then putting the card back in after complete restart worked fine for me.\n\nA: Make sure \"Show External Disks\" is enabled in Finder. Here's how:\nOpen Finder, Click on 'Finder' on the top bar and select preferences. \n'This should bring up the Finder Preferences box. Under the first tab (General) make sure 'External disks' box is ticked.\nUnder the third tab (Sidebar) 'Show these items in the sidebar' scroll down to 'Devices' and make sure the box next to 'External disks' is ticked (though this was probably selected by the first action)\n\nA: I ran disk utility and ran first aid on my main ssd disk and the sd card popped back into existence.\nMight have just gotten lucky but I tried everything else here and it didn't work.\n\nA: I was having this same problem and was able to get the device to show up again by 'Force Quitting' the Finder. When the Finder restarted after the force quit my drive showed up in the devices sidebar again.\nTo force quit hold down Option + Command + Escape, a dialog box will pop up showing you a list of all the applications that you're currently running, select 'Finder' from the list of open applications.\n\nA: In the Finder's sidebar, there should be a section called 'Devices'. Click on the one that's your computer's name and you should see the SD card. Drag it back to the sidebar.\n\nA: In my case it did not show up because the name was blank. I use disk utility to name it.\n\nA: It is odd that just removing and re-inserting the card did not allow you to access the card again. A reboot might help. Failing that open disk utility and see if the inserted card is recognized there. If so you should be able to select the device and format, partition or mount it from within Disk Utility.\nIf it is not showing up even in disk utility then there may be an issue with the card itself (or less likely) an issue with the card slot. If you have another you can try, do that. If not you may have to return the card for warranty replacement.\n\nA: This happened to me today.  It might not be showing up because as quip says since you dragged it out now you have to check it off on devices so it definitely shows up.  \nAlso, since you pulled it out without having 'ejected it' you have to restart your computer as well.  \nMy problem ended up being those and an SD card reader that sometimes had power and sometimes didn't so I had to repeatedly do that stuff till I got the files I needed.  \n\nA: Ran into this problem today, but the answers weren't entirely clear. \nBy the OP's description, he dragged the SD card icon off the Sidebar in the Finder (in the older OS, this was animated with a puff of smoke and occurred with the Dock also). This removes from the Sidebar the shortcut to access SD Cards when they're inserted. \nIt can be activated again through Finder > Preferences > Sidebar and checking the box next to External Disks (you may notice that the box has a minus in it, indicating the removal of the SD card shortcut).\nEither way, the card can still be accessed via it's icon on the Desktop if your Finder preferences are set to do so (General tab).\n\nA: Nothing works. That's the solution. Plug in the camera with a cable, that will work.\n\nA: how i solve this issue was,\n1st use the search on the upper right of your screen (search for sd card)\n2nd under the folders, you will see the sd card.\n3rd open the go on the finder, open all documents\n4th drag and drop the sd card from the search to the device in the all document windows. \nthat should let you see the sd card every time you insert it to your system.\n", "Q: ios offline reading list not working Safari has a built in feature called reading list, for a few years I used it as an alternative to bookmarks for articles. When I was looking at storage usage I saw that safari has 200mb+ for offline reading list, therefore the pages must have been chaeched. However, when I turn my phone into airplane mode and try to access any of the pages from reading list it prompts me an error 'The operation couldn;t be completed. Operation not permitted' \nI tried to search the web for troubleshooting the reading list and the only suggestion I found was to make sure that enable downloading for reading list using cellular is on and it was on. I am not sure what I can do in order to fix it.\n\nA: On my iPhone 6 I need to turn off wifi and cellular data to read my reading list offline. If I have an Internet connection it will try  to load the page from the Internet connection instead of the cached page.\n\nA: Keep the tab open for a few moments. For larger sites, you may need to keep the tab open for a few moments to ensure that Safari saves everything. As long as the website isn't loading anymore, you're safe to close it.\nRefer\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Add-Websites-to-an-iPhone-or-iPad's-Reading-List-to-View-Offline\n", "Q: iPhone contacts When adding a contact, I cannot save their phone number under the catogory of iphone.  Only the \"mobile\" option shows up, where as before I had a \"iphone\" option.  I want the iphone option so I can imessage long distance without a charge.\n\nA: The label you assign to a number in the Contacts app doesn't have any effect on the amount you are charged. I believe the way it works is when you add a phone number, Apple checks it against their own records and if they find that number there (and you can contact Apple's servers at the time you try to send) then it will send text messages through the iMessage service rather than through the regular phone network.\nThat aside, I'm not sure why the iPhone label wouldn't appear unless it is already in use for another number for that Contact. Each label can only be assigned to one number per contact.\n\nA: When you add or edit a contact on an IOS device there is an option to select or add a custom label.\nWhen you tap the green \"+\" to add a contact (for example) the label is underlined. It's a hyperlink/button, tap it. the \"Label\" screen will slide up. You can then select from a list of labels and if you scroll past the preexisting labels there is an option to \"Add Custom Label.\"\n\"iPhone\" is a preexisting label on my iPhone (IOS 8.4) but if it is missing you should be able to add it as a custom label.\n", "Q: Iphone 6 email reverts to 1970 I have an iPhone 6 on iOS 8.4.\nMy problem is that the emails keep getting set back to 1970 and are blank.

I have seen Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2 cables, can't really see which one we need to connect the display to the Mac Pro\n\n*Is it possible to connect a keyboard and mouse to the Thunderbolt Display and control the Mac Pro? \n\n\nFurther explanation of our situation:\nWe have a Mac Pro upstairs which has one account of adobe cloud and we have a laptop with the second adobe cloud account. 1 license is limited to 2 computers.\nWe have 2 Thunderbolt Displays 2 keyboards 2 mouse. We want to use the same Mac Pro in the upstairs office and in the downstairs office which are located right on top of each other. I was thinking of just drilling a whole trough the floor and connecting the second screen via thunderbolt. \n\nA: Copper-based Thunderbolt cables are limited to max length of 3 meters. Corning sells optical Thunderbolt cables you will need for the distance you specify here. You can get 10m lengths at Amazon for US$299. They come in 30m and 60m lengths for US$659 and US$1299, respectively. I haven't had the need for these lengths yet, but I did the research a few weeks ago for a project which didn't get off the ground.\n", "Q: OS X Dictation - more accurate transcription Just for my curiosity and knowledge, from a Software stand point prospective, I read on a book that: \"Further, the server-based dictation in OS X also sends other user information, like your address book contacts, to provide more accurate transcription.\"  What does it mean? How can Dictation improve by sending the address book contacts?\nThank you so much and have a great day.\n\nA: Generally speaking this info is sent so it recognizes people and places. I would also imagine that it will use address information to infer what you are talking about and make more accurate guesses.\nApple has a rather long, informative, article on dictation here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202584\nAnd has a way to change it to Mac-Based dictation so your info is not sent to Apple.\n", "Q: Why does mdworker segfault when scanning files owned by root? While investigating a disk with ever-dwindling free space and a CPU pegged at >100%, I eventually determined that the problem was mdworker repeatedly segfaulting, keeping syslogd and CrashReporter very busy.\nI tried rebuilding Spotlight's indexes in the usual ways: first, via the Privacy tab in System Preferences -> Spotlight, then via mdworker -i off / ; mdworker -E -i on /, and the same again but with an intervening rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100 and reboot for good measure; nothing seemed to solve the problem.\nUsing the Privacy tab to exclude pretty much everything except /Applications/, and then adding/removing this folder to force a re-scan, and I was able to determine that some files are being properly indexed (and show up in Spotlight results) but some are not; a bit more poking around with opensnoop -n mdworker reveals that when mdworker is started with UID 501, to scan Application files owned by me it works fine (and same for a few other UIDs who own files in /Applications/), but when it is started with UID 89 (_spotlight, according to dscl . -list /Users UniqueID) - presumably to scan files owned by root - it segfaults.\nHere's an example entry from Console:\n2015-07-16 13:53:25 com.apple.launchd[1]    (0x100101670.mach_init.mdworker[13276]) Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault\n2015-07-16 13:53:25 com.apple.ReportCrash.Root[13274]   2015-07-16 13:53:25.326 ReportCrash[13274:341b] Saved crash report for mdworker[13276] version ???

I don't want to switch between operating systems, so I'd like to target the Air's SSD (via Thunderbolt 2) when working from the iMac. Here are the devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*2015 13\" MacBook Air i7, 2.2GHZ, 8GB RAM, 512 SSD (Thunderbolt 2)\n\n*Retina iMac i7, 4GHZ Quad, 32GB RAM, (Thunderbolt 2)\n\n\nMy dream is that I'd be using the iMac's RAM & processor, and that Thunderbolt 2 would be fast enough that I wouldn't lose any SSD performance.\nFor me latency matters more than throughput, but I'm interested in both. Processing thousands of small files at once, not editing video.\nWould this work? (theory, experience, benchmarks welcome)\nUPDATE: I'm adding a bounty for anyone that can offer actual benchmarks of targeting a MacBook Air (or pro) SSD from a retina iMac (via thunderbolt 2).\nTo be totally clear - I'm only interested in \"Target Disk Mode\" performance. I want to run the Air's OS. I already know about file syncing, external drives, etc. Thanks everyone for the ideas though.\n\nA: So I tried it out and wanted to share my findings. First off, the equipment I was using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Early 2015 13\" i7 MacBook Air, 8GB Ram, 500GB SSD\n\n*Late 2015 27\" i7 iMac 5K Retina, 16GB Ram, 1TB SSD\n\n\nI restarted the Air in target disk mode & plugged it into the iMac via Thunderbolt 2. It wouldn't boot. After a few minute, it just showed a ban icon (circle with a line through it).\nI ran some 5GB Blackmagic Speed Tests to gather transfer rates (in MB/S):\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac against its SSD - 1817 Read, 1510 Write\n\n*Air against its SSD - 300 Read, 241 Write\n\n*iMac & Air against USB3 Flash Drive - 245 Read, 185 Write\n\n*iMac & Air against USB3 External Drive - 160 Read, 170 Write\n\n*iMac using Air via Thunderbolt 2 shared folder - 400 Read, 490 Write\n\n*iMac using Air in target disk mode - 79 Read, 107 Write\n\n\nSo obviously there's a big performance loss for target disk mode.\nIf you're wondering why I'd want to target the air, it's because I mainly work off my Air and don't want the hassle of an external drive, thumb drive, file syncing, etc. I love the idea of getting to my office and \"docking into\" a faster processor, more RAM, and a big screen.\n\nA: In theory you should not loose too much speed. Most modern SSDs utilize SATA 6 Gbit/s SSD controllers which support 500 MB/s read/write speeds. Thunderbolt 2 works at a theoretical 20 Gbit/s. So Thunderbolt2 should not be the bottleneck.\nHowever..\nMacworld did a performance analysis in 2011. It was a test on Thunderbolt 1, but it should still might give you some insights.\nIf you go to Macworld - More Thunderbolt speed results and scroll down to the section \"Benchmarks: Target Disk Mode via Thunderbolt\" you see that performance did take a huge hit. Even if you double the speed for Thunderbolt 2, you'd still loose over 50%. \nThen there is the more recent (2014) The Instructable article High-Speed Data Transfers between Macs with Thunderbolt, which says:\n\nThunderbolt is capable of faster speeds though this upper limit is a combination of the maximum read/write speeds of the Mac’s SSD and that Parallels VMs are split into many smaller files.  ↩\n\nSorry no definitive answer.. And either way I'd recommend against this setup. I use Dropbox and/or Google Drive to sync files between my machines. This works well for me.\n\nA: So basically I hear three things in your Question. \n\n\n*\n\n*You want the speed and performance of the Air's SSD drive.\n\n*You want to want to leverage the processing performance of the iMac.\n\n*You want to access those files away from the office on your Air.\n\n\nYou should be able to setup a connection using a Thunderbolt Bridge under your Network settings. What follows is a reprint of Apple Help in Yosemite:\n\nUse IP over Thunderbolt\nConnect two Thunderbolt-equipped Mac computers using a Thunderbolt cable, then use Internet Protocol (IP) to communicate between the computers.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connect a Thunderbolt cable to the Thunderbolt ports on the computers you want to connect.\n  \n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Network.\n  \n*Select Thunderbolt Bridge in the network connection services list.\n  \n*Click Advanced, click DNS, then enter the DNS and search domain addresses if your network requires them. Check with the network administrator or your ISP if you’re not sure what the addresses are.\n  \n*Click OK, then click Apply.\nWhen you connect computers using IP over Thunderbolt, by default, the computers receive IP addresses using DHCP. To enter an IP address manually or select another way to receive an IP address, use the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu.\n\nNext you will have to go into settings and set up file sharing.\n\nShare your files with other Mac users\nYou can share files and folders with others on your network. You can share your entire Mac with everyone, or allow specific users access to only certain folders.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Sharing preferences if it isn’t already open (choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Sharing).\n  \n*Select the File Sharing checkbox.\n  \n*To select a specific folder to share, click Add  at the bottom of the Shared Folders list, locate the folder, select it, then click Add.\nThe Public folder of each user with an account on your Mac is shared automatically. To prevent a folder from being shared, select it in the Shared Folders list and click Delete .\n  \n*By default, any user set up on your Mac in Users & Groups preferences can connect to your Mac over the network. A user with an administrator account can access your entire Mac.\nTo give only specific users access to a folder, select the folder in the Shared Folders list, then click Add at the bottom of the Users list. Then do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select a user from Users & Groups, which includes all the users of your Mac.\n  \n*Select a user from Network Users or Network Groups, which includes everyone on your network.\n  \n*Select a person from your contacts. Create a password for the person, then click Create Account.\n  \n  \n*To specify the amount of access for a user, select the user in the Users list, click the triangles next to the user name, then choose one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Read & Write: The user can see and copy files to and from the folder.\n  \n*Read Only: The user can view the contents of the folder but can’t copy files to it.\n  \n*Write Only (Drop Box): The user can copy files to the folder but can’t view its contents.\n  \n*No Access: The user can’t see or copy files from the folder.\n  \n  \n*OS X allows guests to access shared folders on your Mac. To turn off guest access, deselect “Allow guests to connect to shared folders” in the Guest Account pane of User & Groups preferences.\n\nAt this point you should be able to go into Finder on the iMac and mount the drive on the Air. Once mounted, the iMac can control and access the drive as it would any other networked drive.\nI bring up 3. because otherwise the obvious alternative suggestion is just get an external SSD for the iMac. You will run into the same latency issues with an external SSD than you will the the Peer-to-Peer set-up you are suggesting, maybe less as the external SSD will not be running into all of the services that will be running on the Air.\nHowever, it can be a drag carrying around an additional drive when the whole point of an Air is its thinness and portability. The alternative I have used for my MacBook Pro, more for data storage, but it might be an interesting option for you, is to use a SanDisk Cruizer Fit. I have found that they perform as seamlessly as my SSD with no noticeable performance loss, and my experience is with USB2.0. They now have USB3.0 versions up to 128GB. The Cruizer fit is perfect in the sense that it only extends a few centimeters past the edge of the case, and as a result can be left plugged into the Air without the risk of it snapping. This will likely give you similar performance to the other options and just swapping the USD drive allows you the ability to use your data between both systems.\n", "Q: Keynote Play presentation on 1 display and Just see my desktop on my second Is there a way to have keynote play full screen on one display and just let me have access to my desktop on a second display? It always shows the presenter notes. I want to just be able to access my desktop while the presentation is running. \n\nA: I had a similar problem and found a surprisingly simple workaround on the Apple Support Forum (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5522746?tstart=0)\nI needed a way to show my presentation on a webinar and still have access to the webinar control panel so I can see questions when they come in without having to close the presentation first.\nThe SOLUTION:\nYou basically just need to export your completed Keynote presentation as an HTML file and open it in a browser. Then simply make it full screen on the screen or projector you're showing it on.\nI used Chrome and found that the address bar still appeared in full screen view. To fix this I simple unchecked the \"Always show toolbar in full screen\" option in Chrome's View menu.\nSolved the problem for me. Transitions worked too.\nI know this thread is pretty old but I hope that helps someone searching for help with now (like I was)\n\nA: After tons of research around the web, I found a way to run other applications while running a Keynote presentation. Within Keynote's preferences, be sure the box for \"Allow Expose, Dashboard, and others to use the screen.\" Next, set up Mission Control (formerly known as Spaces) do have your Keynote window on Desktop-1 and your other application's window on Desktop-2. Now hit \"Play\". At any point during the presentation, press \"F\" (to pause the slide show); Command-2 (to switch to your alternate application); Command-1 (to switch back to Keynote); and Space Bar (to resume). Your clients will see only one slide for the duration, and will not see anything you are doing on virtual Desktop-2.\n\nA: This issue has been bugging me for ages. However, Apple has finally updated Keynote, half-assed but still.\nIn Keynote 10.1, there is finally the Play > Play Slideshow in Window option which does exactly that.\nYou'll have a window (where still the window bar shows up when you move the mouse, well done Apple!) with your presentation, you can resize it and move it wherever you want, share it with Zoom or another video conference tool and still be able to see your Desktop.\n\nA: Although Keynote can't, there are other options to keep your computer free for use. Transitions and some media may not work identically to Keynote on macOS.\niOS:\nYou can have a pair of iOS devices doing the presentation (one to control, one to present). Then your computer is free to you to use during the presentation.\nVirtual Machine:\nsetup a virtual machine—like VirtualBox, Parallels, or VMWare—and have that virtual machine use one or two monitors and have the other monitor(s) free for use.\nExport to Web:\n@Ricky gave a good description of how to export to web and view in a web browser.\n\nA: There's a new option in Keynote that allow you to present in a window.\nMenu Play -> Play Slideshow in Window.\nYou can also add that option to the toolbar by right-clicking on the toolbar.\n\nA: I couldn't find a way to do get the second screen to become usable, either. However, there are more alternatives that may work for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to full-screen mode in Keynote (Ctrl+Cmd+F). You can now hide the navigator bar (the slide previews on the left) and the Format/Animate/Document settings bar (on the right). This way you are left with the main bar (on top), but it's pretty close to full screen. The biggest problem is that you can not \"play\" the slides this way (so, no animations or transitions), but you can play videos in this view (double click).\n\n*Export the slides to QuickTime and play them as a full-screen movie. You may have press pause/play a lot, but it works. Just play the QuickTime movie in full screen on whichever display you want. (Alternatively, export them to HTML and use your browser in full screen mode or even PDF, if you don't have animations, videos or transitions).\n\nA: The best way I've been able to do this is to have Spaces turned on, start the presentation, then use Exposé to take the presenter's display from the second screen and drag it to the primary monitor (same one that is doing the presentation). However, be aware that clicking on anything on your desktop will loose focus of Keynote.\nYou could potentially use PowerPoint and start the presentation in a Window using the Slide Show > Set Up Show menu, but you'd have to use PowerPoint.\nAnother option that I've seen mentioned, but not in this thread, is doing an export to QuickTime and using the Manual Advance feature. You'll be limited though by not being able to do last minute edits.\n", "Q: How do I change the default track in iTunes? When I press \"play\" on the keyboard, iTunes starts up and launches the very first song of the very first album. I like Amy Winehouse, but everyday might be too much.\nHow can I change that? Ideally, I'd like to have a random song from a specific playlist start.\n\nA: iTunes starts playing what is currently selected. For me for instance the playlist selected was \"Most recently added\", so when I hit the play button on the keyboard, the first song from this list starts to play.\nThe only way I know of to solve your problem is to enable random play in iTunes.\nThis is easily done by clicking the snaked arrow button next to the cover image in the top view. If it's highlighted blue, random play is on.\nQuitting iTunes and hitting the play button again will play a random song from the library.\nDrawback: Whenever you changed that (because you don't want to have random play but want to listen to an album) you have to remind yourself to enable it again before closing it.\nAFAIK there's no preference setting for that.\n", "Q: How do I select/move multiple albums or events in the Photos sidebar? I like the new sidebar in Yosemite Photos. But after upgrading to Photos from iPhoto on my iMac, I have literally dozens of \"Events\" that need to be moved into \"Albums.\" \nWith other sidebar windows (like Finder), I can hold down \"command\" or \"shift\" and select multiple folders at once; that does not seem to work in Photos. I do not want to move each event separately. Every time I try to drag or select more than one event/album, it defaults to one selection.\nHow can I select more than one event/album at once?\nAny help greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You can utilise album view as prior suggested and then drag albums into the sidebar to achieve the desired result, but you are absolutely correct in noting the failure of this desired behaviour to operate, purely within the sidebar itself.\nyup the OSX HCI / UX toolbox in terms of standardisation of elements with predictable results is something that apple has debased since leaving OS9, selectable text OS wide - has similar issues.\n\nA: Try using the Albums view instead. By clicking the \"Albums\" button at the top of the window, you will be presented with a full-page view of your albums. By selecting \"iPhoto Events,\" you will have access to all your iPhoto events, and will be able to Cmd/Shift-select them.\nFinally, by displaying the sidebar, you will be able to drag multiple selected Events into a given Album.\n\nA: Old topic, but I just found your question when I ran into the same problem.\nIt is possible: from the 'Photos' or 'All Photos' view, select all the photos/events you want to, and then instead of using the '+' at the right-hand side of an event title, use the '+' which is in the app title bar, next to the 'Share' and 'Search' box.\n", "Q: Unix \"ln -s\" command not permitted in OSX El Capitan Beta3 I was installing nodejs for Symphony when I hit an \"Operation not permitted\" error.  Anyone know why this happened?\n\nMacBook-Pro-de-XXX:~ XXX$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node\nPassword:\nln: /usr/bin/node: Operation not permitted\n\n\nA: This is the so called \"rootless\" mode in the new version of OS X. It effectively makes certain system directories read-only (even for admins). \"/usr\" is one of those protected directories (the only subdirectory that is excluded from this rule is \"/usr/local\")\nOne can disable this rootless mode with the following commands:\n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"rootless=0\"\n$ sudo reboot\n\nBut this is not recommended! The best practice is to install custom stuff to \"/usr/local\" only.\n\nUpdate (27-Oct-15): 10.11 (El Capitan) Public Release\nPlease note that the above described workaround will not work with the public release of El Capitan anymore as Apple has changed things around.\nThe proper way to disable the \"rootless\" mode (aka System Integrity Protection, \"SIP\") is to boot temporarily into Recover Mode (hold Command+R during boot) and use the csrutil disable command (or csrutil enable to reenable) from the Terminal. The Terminal is reachable via the menu of the Installer that launches in Recovery Mode.\n\nA: In my version of El Capitan the /bin directory did not exist :\n/usr/local/bin\nSo, the fix was : \nmkdir -p /usr/local/bin\nThe -p flag will create the dir (and incidentally any dirs in the full path) if it does not exist.\nThen you can create symlinks & copy apps to /usr/local/bin because /usr/local not part of the \"rootless\" mode.\n", "Q: Appointments in Calendar I have an IMAC that I purchased in Japan in late 2009 annam currently using in the US.

My boyfriend and I both have iPhone 5's and live in Canada.  When he is here, there is no problem.  But when he travels (which is very often) to the States, he is not getting my messages and I am not getting his - at least inconsistently.  HE gets texts from everyone else but me it seems because they are not using iphones. It shows that my messages were sent from me (no errors), but they don't get to him, and viseversa - he is also sending some to me when he is away, that I am not getting.  What in the world is happening?  \nI thought it would send them to one another as an SMS if iMessage was unavailable but evidently not.  But I just noticed a setting that was OFF on mine that says \"send as SMS when iMessage isn't available\".  When did this change? I thought it would automatically do that?\n\nA: You basically answered it yourself. Your iPhone is trying to send iMessages and can only deliver them when he has internet access (apparently he turned data roaming off). What you also can do is click on the message in the blue bubble, hold, and then select \"sent as text measage\".

I'm trying to update Java on my Mac OSX Yosemite.  In the Java Control Panel, it states:\nA critical Java security update is available.\n\n8 Update 51 (57 MB)\n\nYour current version is Java 8 Update 31. It is recommended that you update \nnow to keep your system secure.\n\nI click the Update Now button and it brings up the Software Update dialog that indicates I must relaunch the browser to update, but it will not need to reboot the computer.  I click the Install Update button which brings up the Updating Java dialog that downloads 60 MB, extracts it, and then very briefly says ready to update before disappearing.  Returning to the Java Control Panel shows I'm still on Update 31, repeating the process has same result.\nHow can I get the update to actually install?\n\nA: No need to uninstall the current version. From the Java website just download the Java 8 update 51 (JDK)from Oracle site and install manually. After installation, no need to reboot the machine. Check version in Terminal or Java panel. It will show the updated version.\n\nA: When an automated update process fails without an explicit reason then one method of dealing with it is to manually uninstalled the present installed version and then install the current full version downloaded manually from the source website.\nLooking at How do I uninstall Java on my Mac?, which applies to versions 7.0, 8.0 on OS X for the JRE, one needs to do the following:\n\nUninstall Oracle Java using the Terminal\nNote: To uninstall Java, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove command either as root or by using the sudo.\n  Remove one directory and one file (a symlink), as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click on the Finder icon located in your dock\n  \n*Click on the Utilities folder\n  \n*Double-click on the Terminal icon\n  \n*In the Terminal window Copy and Paste the command below:\nsudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin\nsudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefpane\nDo not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from\n  /usr/bin. This directory is part of the system software and any\n  changes will be reset by Apple the next time you perform an update of\n  the OS.\n\nManually download the latest version from: Java SE Downloads\nNote:  For normal Browser usage choose the JRE however if wanting to use the latest Java from the Command Line in a Terminal choose the JDK.  Additionally if you already have the Java JDK installed I noticed that after updating from version 1.8.0_45 to 1.8.0_51 via the Java Control Panel under System Preferences that it only updated the JRE components to version1.8.0_51, not the JDK and it remained at 1.8.0_45.\nSo I uninstalled the JDK following the directions in Uninstalling the JDK as well as the commands from the directions listed above.\n\nUninstalling the JDK To uninstall the JDK, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove command either as root\n  or by using the sudo(8) tool.\nNavigate to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines and remove the\n  directory whose name matches the following format:*\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk<major>.<minor>.<macro[_update]>.jdk\n\nFor example, to uninstall 7u6:\n% rm -rf jdk1.7.0_06.jdk\n\nDo not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from\n  /usr/bin.

Trying to transfer from a Linux system computer (that was a whole lot of fun) finally figured that out using the dropbox app, but how to get the music from dropbox to an app that I can make playlists and NOT stream as I don't have unlimited data or wifi available ( I know stone age right?)! There has got to be an answer. Don't want to pay for all the music I had on my android device before switching to (cough.. a phone known for music abilities)... help appreciated! (as user friendly as possible I am tec illiterate, sorry.) \n\nA: It's really not possible to get music from Dropbox into the music app on your iPhone. Apple does not support getting music onto your iPhone that way. The Dropbox app will play the songs but is hardly a music playing app.\nYou mention Linux. Do you have a Mac or a Windows PC? The best way is to add the songs to iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC and then sync your files using iTunes. Apple does not make iTunes for Linux and iTunes is the only supported way to get music from your computer onto your iPhone.\nNot being a Linux guy there may be a Linux application that will get the music onto your iPhone without iTunes. Maybe there is a Linux guy here that knows if there is such a thing. I don't know, sorry.\nApple is all about making it simple to do basic things for the majority of people. Those of us at the geeky/nerdy end of the spectrum often face these frustrations. You can either continue to be frustrated, or just relax and do it the Apple way, using Apple software. There are a number of things that have always annoyed me about Apple software and Macs (+ iPhones...) in general. But I have learned to accept the limitations because I don't like Windows and Linux just annoys me. But that is just me, you have to do what works for you.\n\nA: You should check out the CloudBeats app. I haven't used the app personally (and am not affiliated with it), but I've come across it before while contemplating a similar situation. I believe its features meet your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can connect to your Dropbox account (along with various other cloud services) to play audio files\n\n*It can download files for offline playback\n\n*It allows you to create playlists, potentially combining files from multiple sources\n\n\nThe app has a free version with limited features, but that should at least give you a sense of if it would be useful. The full app costs five bucks.\n\nA: Jukebox app is free and does what you want.  It will scan your Dropbox for music, and then download what you select. And it's free.  The music player is limited but it's offline listening with no need for a data connection.\n\nA: I know nothing about Linux, but I do have a pc and an iphone. I can download anything that is in my dropbox directly to my pc.  If it's music, then I save them in a folder or put them wherever I want. Then, I open iTunes that I've already installed on my computer. I locate \"add file\" in iTunes and add the new music I just downloaded to my pc. \nConnect the iphone to the computer while iTunes is open.  ITunes will notice the phone and you'll see it listed in the drop down menu. Locate the music from your music tifles on the screen that you want to add to your phone.

Just for my curiosity and knowledge, from a Software and Hardware stand point prospective, I opened some encrypted files such as Keychains, FileVault, etc.  I do understand that these are encrypted files and they are impossible to decrypt.\nI do noticed that some symbols, I guess used to encrypt and mask the real data, are always the same (for the most part). \nExample: ^@^@^@-^@^@^@1^@^@^@5^@^@^@9^@^@^@=�^@^@^A^@^@^@^@sdmn^@^@^@^@^@^@^\nMy question is, are these symbols below have a specific meanings?\n^\n@\n�\nThank you so much and have a wonderful day.\n\nA: What you're seeing is an attempt to make the raw file data viewable.\n^@ is a method of displaying a \"control\" character in plain text. This arose as a method of directly displaying (and entering) data that a font or keyboard couldn't otherwise handle. You can see a list of them here, see the column \"Caret Notation\".\nThe question mark in a diamond is a common way to indicate a character that can't be shown in the current view for various reasons. See Replacement character.\nAs for \"looking the same\", some file types have an easily recognizable signature, such as GIFs that start with \"GIF89a\". This is to let a program quickly decide if a given file is something it can handle. Here is a Wikipedia page that discusses them: Magic Number.\nIf you're using Quick Look to view a file, it tries to find a \"filter\" that  converts the file to something useful. For instance, you can view binary plist files because they can be converted to xml using plutil. \nOn the other hand, Text Edit doesn't have the concept of filters, so it'll try to convert the otherwise binary format to something it can display.\nIn terminal, less will ask \"com.apple.finder.plist\" may be a binary file. See it anyway? to give you the chance to avoid trying to make the terminal interpret control codes that might have undesirable consequences.\nSorry, this turned into an essay :)\n", "Q: Time Machine: Is it possible to exclude 5000+ files via TMUTIL? Is there a limit to the number of files which can be excluded in TimeMachine?\nI have 5000+ photos on an external drive along with their associated sidecar files.  The photos are large and never change (I back them up separately) but I need to backup the sidecar files.  The photos and sidecar files need to be located in the same directory\nSo, I thought I would just exclude the photos using TMUTIL.  I thought I could do it with one command for the whole directory structure.  That didn't work.  So I did it by year which worked at first but I seem to be reaching a limit (Around 1315) and when I try to  exclude just a few, i get the error:\nInsufficient privileges to change exclusion setting.\n(Although I don;t think it's anything to do with privileges).\nDoes anyone have any advice please…?\nMany thanks, Karen\n\nA: If there are hard limits, sorry, I don't know what they are however I have many exclusions set for Time Machine and one in particular has 294,691 files in it.  So instead of doing it folder by folder try setting the exclusion from Options... in Time Machine under System Preferences.\nPlug in the external drive and then either drag and drop the parent folder containing the files you want to exclude or the drive icon into the Exclude these items from backups: list area or use the [+][-] buttons.\n", "Q: How can I limit bandwidth for a specific port/app in OS X 10.10 Yosemite? I am running OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and I am looking for a way to limit upload bandwidth specifically on TCP port 8333, so I can run Bitcoin Core to contribute outgoing bandwidth without completely saturating my connection.\nHere is a list of utilities I have looked into:\n\n\n*\n\n*ipfw - This has been deprecated since OS X 10.7, and has been removed in OSX 10.10. Unfortunately this also means that any ipfw GUIs are out too (Waterroof, Speedlimit, Noobproof, etc).\n\n*Network Link Conditioner - This allows bandwidth limiting on Yosemite, but only on a system-wide level. I’m looking for a solution that will limit bandwidth only on a specific port, or only for a specific app, so my entire system won’t be affected by the limit.\n\n*pfctl - This is the new tool that replaces ipfw in Yosemite, but there is a lot less help available online, especially on limiting port/application bandwidth.\n\n*dnctl - There is almost no documentation available for this online, but it seems like it may be able to do the job if configured properly. It has been mentioned before in this Stack Overflow question, but the answer doesn't provide any examples on how to use/configure dnctl to limit bandwidth.\nIn short, I am looking for a way to limit bandwidth of a specific application/port on OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Does anything like this exist? And if so, how can I use it to limit outgoing traffic for a specific app, or on TCP port 8333?\n\nHere is what I've tried with pfctl and dnctl:\nMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ sudo pfctl -E\nPassword:\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\npf enabled\nToken : 1626248500898813477\nMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ (cat /etc/pf.conf && echo \"dummynet-anchor \\\"customRule\\\"\" && echo \"anchor \\\"customRule\\\"\") | sudo pfctl -f -\npfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules\npresent in the main ruleset added by the system at startup.\nSee /etc/pf.conf for further details.\n\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\nMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ echo \"dummynet in quick proto tcp from any to any port 8333 pipe 1\" | sudo pfctl -a customRule -f -\npfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules\npresent in the main ruleset added by the system at startup.\nSee /etc/pf.conf for further details.\n\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\nMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ sudo dnctl pipe 1 config bw 10Kbit/s\nMaximillians-MacBook:~ Max$ \n\nUnfortunately I'm still getting over 1Mbit/s chugging through my connection on port 8333.\n\nA: For port 8333:\nCreate the anchor for pf to use:\n(cat /etc/pf.conf && echo \"dummynet-anchor \\\"customRule\\\"\" && echo \"anchor \\\"customRule\\\"\") | sudo pfctl -f -\n\nCreate the PIPE to send the desired port to your dummynet anchor:\necho \"dummynet in quick proto tcp from any to any port 8333 pipe 1\" | sudo pfctl -a customRule -f -\n\nThen set the desired speed for the pipe you created: (E.X: limit to 10mb/s)\nsudo dnctl pipe 1 config bw 10Mbit/s\n\nhttp://mop.koeln/blog/2015/06/01/Limiting-bandwidth-on-Mac-OS-X-yosemite/\nI have been using a app called Murus, It claims to do this and much more but I have yet to get it to work on the free version for port throttling.

I typically leave messages as unread if I need to remember to read them later.\nAlso I like to keep my inbox clean, so I delete mail I don't care about saving.\nWhen I select a message and press delete, the selection jumps to the next item in the list. Many times, this is the item I just marked as unread for later.\nHow can I avoid this?\n\nA: The easiest (albeit slightly lengthy) way to do this is to create a custom service, like so:\nCreate a new Automator Service. Have it take no input in Mail and put the following code into a \"Run JavaScript\" action:\nmail = Application('Mail')\nmail.includeStandardAdditions = true\nfor (i in mail.selection()) {\n    mail.selection()[i].delete()\n}\n\nSave the service. Then go to System Preferences > Keyboard, select Shortcuts at the top, and select Services in the sidebar. Scroll to the bottom to where it says \"General\" and you should see your Service there. Assign it a keyboard shortcut. This shortcut (so long as it does not conflict with any existing shortcuts) will allow you to delete a selected Mail message without selecting the next conversation.\n\nA: There are two ways to do that.\nThe easy way is to use the \"List view\".\nAs long you use the preview window it will mark email as read as soon it shows in the preview window.\nThe more complicated is to move the cursor upward then delete, now it wont mark the unread as read because it will move to next read (assuming it is above the just deleted). Try it, and take not which way did you move /up or down.\n", "Q: Launch Center Pro URL-scheme syntax for launching an action Recently I've been using the Workflow app to create home screen shortcuts that launch third party apps via their respective URL-schemes. This avoids the annoying initial time it takes LCP to load up its home grid on my iPhone 5. However, I've been unable to move one particular third party URL-scheme onto my home screen because it involves an unfortunately necessary lc-callback, and thus needs to be launched from within LCP in order to work. (Lc-callbacks are LCP's special workaround for when an app doesn't support URL chaining via x-callback-url. One has to manually return to LCP from the third party app, but once done the workflow may continue on.)\nDoes anyone know LCP's own specific URL scheme syntax for launching an action? I've tried things like 'launch://action={{ACTION_NAME}}' but this only opens LCP and nothing else.\n\nA: Use a mix of the action ID (the name won't work, but every action has its own ID) and the url action. It will look like this:\nlaunchpro://?url=[action:170]\n\nTo find the ID, edit an action and scroll to the bottom, you'll find the action there by the edge of the screen.\n\n\nA: In case anyone else is wondering, for me, as of November '15, Mr. Gruneich's answer, without the 'pro' as in \nlaunch://?url=[action:170]\n\nworks, comes in handy for including Launch Center Pro actions in the Launcher notification gadget. \nMany thanks for the original answer, trying to figure out the part after '?' was driving me crazy.\n", "Q: Yosemite swoosh missing fix required Have recently upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite 10.10.4, and found that Mail's swoosh sound when sending mail is no longer evident.

It was set up with boot camp and Windows 7 professional loaded on the internal SSD.\nI would like to add to the amount of disk available by using a OWC Mercury elite pro Dual Thunderbolt disk that internally stripes two 3 TB drives making a 6 TB partition.\nThe machine boots fine with just a Mac monitor plugged in the thunderbolt. \nWhat I insert the disk into the thunderbolt chain and attempt to boot the machine the boot sequence finds the Windows 7 partition on the SSD and then the screen goes black with only a single blinking underscore in the upper left corner. \nThe Machine and drive functions fine when plugged in using USB3. \nI have critical reasons for wanting to use thunderbolt instead of USB3.\n\nA: OWC Brittany C: there is a limitation on using a Thunderbolt device and Windows 7. Having a Thunderbolt device plugged in when trying to boot to Windows 7 will prevent boot. Also the machine will not detect a Thunderbolt device in Windows 7 unless it is plugged in upon start up. So basically thunderbolt devices are not going to work in Windows 7. You would need another operating system on that machine in order to boot with the device plugged-in when using Thunderbolt. Or Windows 8. They fixed the Thunderbolt bug in the Windows 8. \n\nA: I encountered the same problem on my Mac mini late 2012, connecting to AKiTiO Thunder2 PCIe Box with HyperX Predator PCIe Gen 2.0 x4 240GB SSD (SHPM2280P), ruuning Boot Camp Windows 2012 R2.\nHere are the steps to bypass the problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the mac mini, and turn off the thunderbolt drive.\n\n*Turn on the mac mini, as soon you hear the boot up chime, press and hold the option key to bring up the select OS menu.\n\n*Now turn on the thunderbolt drive.\n\n*Select Windows and boot\nThe downside is if you restart the server remotely, it will get stuck at the boot up process.

I have a 250GB macbook air. I do a lot of photography, so my SSD gets filled up with photos really quickly. I've been using a 2TB external hard drive to archive the older photos that I no longer need to store in my SSD, moving the folders with the photos manually to the external hard drive, and then deleting them in my SSD. I was wondering if there is a way to do this automatically? The process should backup all the sub-folders in my Pictures folder to the hard drive, but without deleting the sub-folders that I have already deleted in my SSD.\n\nA: If you are not afraid of using Terminal, you can run\nrsync -a --progress /PATH/TO/Pictures /Volumes/EXTERNAL/Pictures/\n\n", "Q: Is Safari, in incognito mode, saving its settings?

I don't know how many times I turned it down to 0, it always is \"reset\" once I re-start Safari.\nThis happens only with Safari. Other browsers (Chrome) and all other applications always starts with the volume, it was set, when leaving it. This brings me to a bit mad assumption, that in incognito mode Safari does not save anything, neither browsing data (cookies, history) nor its own settings.\nCan that be true?\n\nA: That is the point of Private Browsing (Safari's calls it Private Browsing, Chrome calls it Incognito). When you use Private Browsing, Safari shouldn't be saving anything at all.

Then enter my username and password into the google login form. Then enter my 2-step Verification code and accept the permissions request.\nThen OS X asks what apps I would like to use with my account. I leave all ticked. Then almost immediately I get this error:\n\nThen I get this the same error for my Notes which also uses IMAP.\nI have tried multiple computers and have no issue with iOS setup. Just OS X. I've setup other Google Apps accounts with the exact same DNS settings and don't have this issue with them.\n\nA: It appears that you may be in the United Kingdom, and it appears that there is an issue with how you need to set up email accounts within Apple Mail for .co.uk domains.\nApple provides this web app to allow you to enter your email account and returns a page such as this:\n\nAs I am trying this from the States, it is likely that the web app senses my location so it will likely be different settings for you. I am not sure if this will give you something different than what you have already entered, however there may be some weird Server Port that you need to set in order for Apple Mail to work with a UK based Mac and your @unknowndomain.co.uk Google Apps account.\nYou will need to go under Mail>Preferences>Accounts, then select the gmail account and click on the Advanced tab to enter in the port that the web app returns.\nApple also has Mail Connection Doctor; which can help to diagnose if you still have no joy.\nIt may also be that you have not enabled IMAP on your Google Apps account. Follow these instructions on how you do that in gmail. This support page for Google Apps administrators may also have additional information that you need to follow.\nIt appears that you do not want to go the Application Specific Password route for a specific reason. I still think that the problem is likely something to do with the ports that you need to enter or enabling IMAP on your Google Apps account.\nI hope you find an answer.\nUpdate\nMaybe this will help, or at least explain why it may not be working for you?...\nAutodiscover for Google Apps\n\nA: I have found Mac apps do not always work well with Google 2-step authentication.

Then needed to fix the permission of home directory with \n$ cd /Users/\n$ sudo chown -R hook1:staff /Users/hook1\nchown: /Users/hook1: no file or directory\n$ ls -F\nShared/    chris/      hook1???/\n\nHome directory incorrectly appears as hook1???/ not hook1/\nIs there a reason for this? \n\nA: If what you posted was literally what the directory name is, then this should work:\ncd /Users\nmv hook1\\?\\?\\? hook1\n\nThe problem, as fd0 points out, is that you have invisible/unprintable characters in your directory name. Use basic, non-destructive shell commands to isolate the directory name using wildcards, then rename it.

It's rather complicated so I'll explain from the beginning but try to give only the important details.\nSo some time ago I bought a 2012 MacBook Pro second hand, which came with a blank password. On the login screen it would just show up with apple I would just press enter to log in. I was not aware of the existence of an Admin account or password.\nToday I was trying to restore my iPod when it asked me for my password, it wouldn't accept the blank password when I pressed enter. I wondered if it could have wanted an admin password but it was asking for the password for my user account 'Apple'. I also wondered if it could be possible that there was a password but that it was set not to ask me for it, which didn't seem to be the case in settings.\nI concluded that probably the blank password was confusing the system in some way but that either way if I could change the password or create one if there was none that either way it should work out.\nAfter some research I used Disk Utility to reset the password for the user account. I discovered an Admin account on the drop down so I reset the password for that as well, thinking that if the first didn't work then that should do the trick.\nWhen I rebooted there was a slight difference on the login screen; rather than just having the 'Apple' account there, there was also 'More' next to it. Clicking on more brought up username and password fields, which did not work with 'Admin' and the admin password that I had set.\nI logged into my account fine, however the Keychain password of course no longer matched. I tried to change the Keychain password using a blank password field (which I presume it must have been, to match with the previously blank user login password) and with my new login password, but neither worked. I also tried changing my user password back to a blank one but that also failed.\nI don't necessarily need to gain access to the keychain as most if not all the data is stored in Chrome anyway. I realised this just now while writing but I will continue the question as it may be helpful for others in the future.\nI would also just be interested to know why all these issues came up, if a blank password can cause such problems it seems like a bit of a design floor. It also dawned on me that most of the passwords listed I haven't been on since owning this laptop, so does it just download the data from chrome? What's the point in that? \nIf I just log into chrome anyway and it does the work for me then I have no need for this Keychain encryption. If anything it's just one more place (albeit a much more secure one it seems) from where my data could be compromised.\nI would also be interested to know why I am unable to log into this Admin account.\n\nA: The \"admin\" account you set a password for was \"System Administrator (root)\". You'll either need to type \"System Administrator\", or \"root\" as the user name. This \"super user\" account is part of the operating system, and can do whatever it wants - including things that have extremely negative consequences. I recommend disabling it. See OS X Mountain Lion: Enable and disable the root user[1] for how.\nIf you want to fix the keychain and can't figure out what password it uses, open Keychain Access and click the \"Reset my default keychain\" button on the General tab of Preferences. If a problem with \"Local Items\" occurs after rebooting, see this article.\nAs for the use of empty passwords, that is probably on purpose. You can't start a new user with no password anymore, and you can't unlock Security and Privacy system preferences without a password.\nAnd finally, Chrome doesn't have a keychain to make use of on other operating systems, so if it can't use the user account's keychain it makes sense to me that it'll fall back on its own internal storage.\n[1] It has been the same method for a long time, you can ignore the \"Mountain Lion\" in the title.\n", "Q: My MacBook Air is receiving messages from my parents' phones. I want it to receive messages from only my phone though! My whole family has the same Apple ID to prevent confusion. It has worked in the past, however whenever we add a new device we struggle with this problem. And as if that wasn't frustrating enough, messages that my dad sends to my mom show up on my Macbook as me sending the messages to my mom. I also receive my mom's phone calls on my MacBook and my iPhone 6. I have already checked the settings on all said devices and none of them have iCloud message sharing enabled. Additionally, all the devices can be contacted by only one number/email and none of them share anything except the Apple ID. Help would be much appreciated! Thank you!\n\nA: In Apple world if you are using same Apple ID, your messages and information are shared across devices.  That is the reason why you are seeing the messages sent by your family members on your macbook.  \nI would advise you to create separate Apple ID for every individual or disable iMessage from their personal devices. So that the device that was disabled for iMessage would not sync messages across devices.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Will I lose third party apps if I delete user 501? One users account is broken. No apple apps work. Can I delete and create a new user and not lose Registered Apps like Adobe. The problems with the account seem to never end. Fix one another pops up.

When I tried adding one of them to the Mail app, something really annoying happened. The other Gmail account keeps receiving forwarded emails from this account. All emails in this added account were being forwarded there and I did not know how to stop that. I checked the Forwarding and POP/IMAP settings in both Gmails but there's no forwarding configured. I disabled POP, too. I tried disconnecting the two Gmail accounts in Google's setting, but problem still not solved. I don't understand, by now this account should know nothing about the other, but when I add it to the Mail app, the crazy forwarding started again.\nJust to be clear, I only added one of the two Gmails to the Mail app, so the Mail app should not know anything about the other account. Then the wrong must be in Google's side, but I disconnected them and checked every setting, still have no clue why they still are linked somehow. I did nothing strange before, just having this two Gmail accounts and trying to add one to the Mail app, so I guess it shouldn't be a rare problem. But there seemed to be no relevant solutions when I googled. Could someone help me with this? Does anyone have a similar problem?\n\nA: I had the same problem and once I unchecked (in the email I was receiving the forwards into) that I could send from the other email as an alias the problem stopped and the forwarding ceased.\n", "Q: Add outline to text in Preview Preview use to support adding an outline to text. \nUsing a black outline with white fill for lettering was really nice for making words visible on dynamic backgrounds. Has this feature been removed in Version 8? Or is there another way to do this?\n\nA: Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to exactly imitate the desired behavior. You may have to simply create the outlined text in a different application and import it into Preview.\nHowever, while it might not be exactly what you're looking for, you can create text with a background color. To do so, bring up the markup toolbar and create a new text box. Then, using the dropdown menu indicated in the below screenshot, select a background color.\n\n\nThe font, along with its color and size, can be modified by selecting the \"A\" icon to the right of the aforementioned menu. If you want a literal outline around the entire text box, that can be accomplished by selecting the dropdown to the left of the previously mentioned background color menu.\n\nA: Hack mode:\nYou could write your text in black e.g. in font size 100, and then write it again in white in font size 99 (or smaller) and place it on top of the black text. That way you will have a white text with a black outline... ish\nHere's what you could do with font size 200 and 192 (the black letters are added character by character):\n\n", "Q: OS X 10.10.4 (14E46) - How do I get 'å' character on US keyboard?

Is find my Mac suppose to randomly create it?\n\nA: With Find My Mac enabled, someone who found the computer could sign into the guest user, which could then be located via iCloud. The guest user is a feature of the operating system which allows people to temporarily use your computer but not save any files.\nYou can go into Users&Groups System Preferences and disable it, for more details see this article \nJust make sure you don't sign into it and expect files you save to still be there after restarting the computer :)\n", "Q: Command Line Tools Difference? Is there a difference between the command line tools that come with xcode and the ones installed with xcode-select? If I install xcode and then run xcode-select --install will the ones installed with xcode be overwritten?\n\nA: Xcode has command line tools embedded in its application bundle that are used by the Xcode IDE as needed and are separate and apart from the Command Line Tools for Xcode package, that can be downloaded by itself, which installs outside of the application bundle. The separate package can be installed and use without having the Xcode application installed.  As to versioning, I believe as each version of Xcode is available a corresponding version of the Command Line Tools for Xcode package is also made available and for what's included in common should be the same versions.  When installing the Command Line Tools for Xcode package with Xcode installed it does not overwrite the Xcode.app bundled command line tools, they are updated as Xcode is.\n\nA: If I recall correctly it downloads the xcode tools command line package, which is part of the main xcode distribution. I wouldn't expect it to download anything at all if the command line tools are already installed.\n", "Q: OS X 10.11 El Capitan - Verifying file dialog, every time a file is opened Not sure, if this question will be closed, but the situation is quite annoying.\nEvery time, I open some .pdf or .jpg file, a dialog appears,and it seems to be stuck there for a long time.

If our app has passed beta review, meaning we can distribute via TestFlight to 1000 external users, do we still need to setup test user accounts for in app purchases? \nSeems like that would be a huge burden, not only for developers (I guess people could share test user account logins, but that could screw up the testing !!!), but also for testers (testers have to logout of the app store on their phone, then log back in with test user account).\n\nA: No. According to this article, sandbox accounts are automatically created for TestFlight users.

But some people (like me) still would like to be able to send, say, a private email that only the receiver will read.  \nSending encrypted files is becoming forbidden for some email providers, like GMail (read their terms), so .zip or .rar encrypted are returned to the sender as failed. And installing cryptographic programs is a nightmare for common (and even experienced) users of something like an iPhone.\nA simple workaround: send your files (a document if you just want to send text) inside an encrypted file (say .rar) like:\nMyPrivateFile.rar\n\n... but rename it to:\nMyPrivateFile.jpg\n\nThe receiver must rename just the extension, and voila! : you both have succeeded in sending encrypted info via email.\nBut, as you know, the email program's interface in the iPhone is too simple. I am not very experienced in using it, but I think it does not allow... well, it does not allow many things, even file saving inside the phone, so renaming file extensions must be even more difficult.  \n\nA: Tho I have never had to do this before but I just checked and it seems that Dropbox allows you to rename files.

If I go 2GB is the video memory upgradable? I haven't bought the Mac Pro yet.\n\nA: The minimum amount of VRAM Apple recommends for running Final Cut Pro X is 256 MB. As a Final Cut Pro user myself (albeit a very light user), I find that 1 GB is sufficient, though I rarely put the program \"through its paces,\" and the work you will be doing will likely be on a larger scale. 1 GB also happens to be Apple's minimum recommendation for editing 4K video and 3D titles.\nUltimately, it depends on how intensive the work you're going to be doing is. Are you going to be doing intensive work with 4K content? Or are you going to do smaller home video-style projects? It may be useful to use Apple's recommendations as bases for comparison as you make your decision (see below).\nTo view the entire list of minimum system requirements, see Apple's Final Cut Pro X Tech Specs page. This Apple Support Communities discussion also has some interesting details about VRAM and how it applies to Final Cut Pro X.\n\nA: The video memory will not be upgradable. You can upgrade the system RAM, and if you were able to find one, the Solid State Drive.\nI have no Final Cut Pro experience, so I can't say if the 2gb video RAM is enough.\n\nA: While gaming related, this post looks relevant to you. The long and the short is that VRAM actually affects video performance fairly minimally. The major gain is the ability to run multiple monitors/higher resolutions. \nThat said, the answer to \"is enough\" in computer circles is almost always \"get the most\" if you're planning on using a single monitor and editing 1080p video, the standard 2GB FirePros will be absolutely fine (Final Cut runs well on my 2011 MBP with a slower Radeon card and 1GB VRAM). If you plan on doing higher-end things (4k video editing at resolution with multiple clips and editors on multiple monitors), you will feel the upgrade. \nBear in mind all the advice you'll be getting will be relevant now, if this is a work machine that you can play on using for several (5+ years) and have the extra money, having more VRAM certainly won't hurt anything...\n", "Q: Dock shortcut for an interactive bash script I'm new to OSX and all I want it an application shortcut in Dock that opens the terminal and types the first command and waits for me to provide the password.

Her favorite part of the Mac is using the Mail app, which I've tried time and again to find an equivalent, but nothing's got everything. I've now had the thought to just set up PuTTY on her computer to open an Xsession via SSH, on a user specific to her, and have the Mail app open automatically. How do I set this up?\n\nA: XQuartz, which is the OS X X-server implementation doesn't support native Aqua apps like Mail.app, just regular unix X-server apps - xterm, etc, so I don't think this will work for you.\nHowever, OS X does come with VNC built in, if you want to share screens from Windows. It's under Sharing in System Preferences, check the box for 'Screen Sharing'.

This window pops up every few minutes (macbook pro circa 2006 running OS 10.6)\n\nI no longer have this internet service, so how do I get it to go away? Hitting cancel or ok just makes it pop back up in a few minutes. Doesn't matter if the airport is turned on or off - it still comes up.\nThanks!\nKendra\n\nA: It is likely that you just need to delete one of the connections in Network Preferences.\nGo to System Preferences > Network\nYou will likely have a list of connections on the left, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc. One of them is likely the connection above.\nClick on each of them, in turn till you find the one that corresponds to the connection in your question. Click on the \"-\" at the bottom left to delete the selected connection.\nThat should do it. If not then we will need the screen captures \"TheBro21\" asked for.\n", "Q: Empty .MOV file, stuck on iPhone After using Image Capture to copy all my photos and movies from my iPhone to my Mac, and deleting from the iPhone, I find I have one stubborn remaining file listed in Image Capture. It has a usual name, IMG_0155.MOV, but the size shows as 0. \nThere is indeed such a movie copied to my Mac, with a normal size of 93 MB. The movie plays normally in Preview.app on the Mac. \nI cannot select the file in Image Capture, so I cannot click the Delete button (red circle with slash).\nIs there some way to get rid of this glitchy ghost file?\n\nA: I ran into the same mysterious problem. Easiest answer I have found that worked for me: simply delete the offending empty .mov file(s) directly from your iPhone's Photos app (select and trash). They will then magically disappear from Image Capture and Photos on your Mac.\n\nA: If the device is jailbroken, you can manually delete the file from /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/*APPLE/.\n", "Q: Which part of my iPhone 5 screen should I take off? I'm trying to replace my iPhone 5 battery, but first I have to take my screen off. My screen appears to be glued shut on the right side, but from what I can see of the inside of it, it looks very different than the tutorials. So I'm starting to think I'm not taking off the whole screen. In the picture below, should I continue to pry #1 out, or should I pop #2 out along with #1?\n\n\nA: The glass sits in the plastic guide underneath, you should focus on lifting the plastic guide first. \nOnce propped slightly up, focus on the sides of the guide because there are metal clips connecting to the enclosure of the device. \nIf too much pressure is applied, the plastic will break!\nIn other words, #2 should be your focal point.\n", "Q: How to turn on email notifications when Find My iPhone is used? I actually liked getting email notifications when Find My iPhone was used and all of the sudden they stopped. I can't find any options to turn them back on. Anyone know why they stopped or how to get them back?\n\nA: You can't turn off email notifications, so they are being sent, but not being delivered. Check that the email address is correct and the emails are not being delivered to your spam folder.\n", "Q: How can I share Navionics with my iPhone Hi I have Navionics on the iPad (love it) Can i share it onto my iPhone some how?\nCheers Deano\n\nA: Here is what Navionics says about that:\n\nTo turn on the Sync My Data function go to either Archive or Settings\n  in the app menu and turn on the Sync My Data option.\nYou will be required to create a Navionics Account (or sign into an\n  existing Navionics Account).

Since my MacBook doesn't have enough disk space for all my photos, I took an external USB HDD and created a second photo library. That was back then with Aperture. Now I have moved to the new Photos app and the iCloud photo library. \nHow do I move the pictures from the external HDD library to iCloud Photos? The Photos app refuses to use iCloud Photos when switching to the external library:\n\n\n\nA: I have two solutions now. First, there seems to be some software out there, namely Powerphotos, which can manage multiple libraries for the Photos app.\nSecond, one can select the external library as the system library and then sync it with iCloud. This is obviously a bit stupid if you want to keep the libraries separate. But in my case this is ok, since I merely want to get all my pictures into the iCloud Photos. \nIf you still need multiple libraries, you probably should use PowerPhotos and copy pictures from the dedicated libraries to the system library using that tool.\n", "Q: Disassociating from an old Apple ID I recently change my Apple ID and password. However, now I an unable to use System Preference; each time I click on System Preference I am asked to input password for the old Apple ID which doesn't exist any longer. How can I disassociate my MacBook Pro from this old Apple ID which doesn't exist?\n\nA: You didn't erase the old Apple ID, it still exists. Not using it doesn't make it go away.\nAll the apps installed on your machine, including the OS itself, are tied to that original ID.\nThe only way to be rid of it is to reformat the boot drive & start over; install a fresh OS, repurchase all App Store apps under the new ID.\nThe essential paradigm difference between Apple & Microsoft is that Microsoft ties a purchase to a machine.\nApple ties it to a user.\nThis makes changing machines easy, but changing users difficult.\n", "Q: Impact of Spotlight search information removal on Keynote presentation OS X Spotlight search information was removed.\nWhat does this mean for my Keynote presentation made in iWork '09?\n\nA: Nothing.

I am trying to find a way for applescript to access my facebook unread notifications and whatsapp web unread chats and read it out to me. \nI can use applescript to access mail or other mac apblications am facing difficulty with accessing the notifications and chats in google chrome browser. Is it possible to do it?\n\nA: AppleScript is built by Apple, for Apple (though unfortunately support has steadily declined since the move from 10.6.8 to 10.7)\nWhile it is possible to do what you describe with AppleScript (or any language, with enough blood, sweat, tears, and coffee), it will be much more difficult than using Facebook's API to view your notifications (or using OS X's built-in Facebook plugin). \nAs far as scripting Chrome with AppleScript, Safari will be easier as it has some built-in hooks. I'd start with something to download a YouTube video (non-copyrighted, of course) using Safari, else you may get bogged down in authentication and trying to parse HTML, rather than actually having fun coding. \n", "Q: How to reformat a USB to not be a bootable operating system I recently created a bootable USB from a .img file, here's what the USB looks like:\n\nAnd this is what it looks like in Disk Utility:\n\n\nIs there a way to reformat this USB to just store files?\n\nA: If you insert the USB drive, launch Disk utility and select the USB drive on the left side of the Disk Utility window you should now be able to operate on it.\nPersonally I would select Partition and then the number of partitions you want. Then apply it.\nThat should do it\n", "Q: Tell if screen is original or replacement on iPhone 5 I recently bought a iPhone 5 on eBay. Now I'm suspicious if the screen is the original one or a replacement.\nIs there a way I can clarify my concernings?\nThe screen has problems to recognize my touches and sometimes doesn't work at all.\nHere are a few pics of the \"suspicious-looking\" Screen \n\n\nYou can see the different colors on the screen AFTER I cleaned the whole screen with a special display cleaner.\nCan someone explain this ?\n\nA: I am not sure what those marks you are showing are, but I am slightly concerned by the colour of the proximity sensor on the left of the ear piece in photo 1... \nHave a look at my previous answer to a similar question:\nHow to check if the screen replacement part for iPhone 5s is an original one?\nThis might help also.\n\nA: I know that this is pretty late, but I do think that I have an answer about the discoloration. The iPhone that I bought from Craigslist had similar discoloration around the apple logo, the fingerprint sensor, and the front camera/ear piece. The guy that I bought it from had told me he had kept a screen protector and an otter box on this phone since the day he got it. I put the otter box on, and the only exposed places where the places of discoloration. I can assume that the sun and other light sources caused that discoloration. Your iPhone could have had a case enclosing it, or a screen protector. The sun may have only wore on one area of the screen causing that space to discolor. Your screen is rather thick though.\n", "Q: How to configure the battery percentage at which the mac will hibernate I've replaced my macbook pro battery with a non-official one and since the battery lasts a few hours less that the original one did at first (6h < 9h) when my battery starts running out at 1% there's not enough battery power to perform the hibernate to disk, so I always end up with a forced shutdown. Is there anyway to tell the mac to force the hibernation at a 5% of battery or something like that? I've tried pmset but that only work if you have an attached UPS.\n\nA: I had a similar problm, and found that there was no ready-made solution to force the computer to sleep at a different battery percentage (eg. go into \"Safe Sleep\" at 5% instead of 1%).\nThe (lame) workaround I ended up using was using SlimBattery Monitor to issue a pop-up warning at a custom battery percentage (for me it was 20%), at which point I must close my laptop/manually tell it to sleep, until I can get it on AC power.\nIt seems you would have to write your own applescript to make the computer sleep if the battery is too low, and add a LaunchAgent to have it repeatedly run the script to check the battery power.  Annoying enough that I didn't venture down that path.  I was surprised none of the many battery-monitoring programs had this funcitonality (I may have just missed the one that does).\n", "Q: Wiping my New MacBook Pro after Using Command Q to Stop Migration Got my new MB pro mid-2014 yesterday.  Began migrating over wi-fi only to learn that it will take 14 hours that I don't have.  After 45 minutes I halted on both computers using command Q.  My question, how do I safely wipe the new computer clean so that I can start again by transferring from time machine?\n\nA: I suggest you use Apple Mac's Disk Utility, select the disk or volume in the LH column that you wish to clear, specify a format and name and click on Erase. Also select Security Options if you wish to prevent any recovery of previously deleted files.\n", "Q: Applications Folder on Macintosh HD Shows Empty Before attempting to migrate data from my Time Machine, I looked in to see if my Adobe applications and others were there to transfer.  The folder is empty.  Is this normal?  Thanks.\n\nA: There are two Application folders. One is under the root directory and should contain all of your Applications. This is /Applications\nThe other folder is in the User directory, so ~/Applications. ~/ is a shorthand for /Users/<UserName>. That folder is usually empty or has one or two stray Apps in there.\n", "Q: Apple wired mouse only scrolls up My Apple wired mouse will either just scroll up but not down, or the opposite. What can I do to solve the issue?\n\nA: This is a common issue with Apple Wired Mice (a.k.a. Mighty Mouse) products. There is no permanent fix, the issue happens when the mouse gets dirt from your fingers building up in the mechanism, and eventually jams.\nYou can fix it temporarily by following these instructions. There is a section \"Magic Trackpad, Magic Mouse, Wireless Mighty Mouse, and Apple Wireless Mouse, Wired Apple Mouse, Wired Mighty Mouse\", the instructions are in the second paragraph:\n\nIf the scroll ball on your Mighty Mouse has become discolored or\n  dirty, use a clean, lint-free cloth lightly moistened with water to\n  clean it. Wipe the ball and the surrounding area, making sure to\n  rotate the ball itself to ensure complete coverage. If the scrolling\n  feels rough or if the scroll ball isn't scrolling up, down, or\n  side-to-side, hold the Mighty Mouse upside down and roll the ball\n  vigorously while cleaning it to help dislodge any particles that might\n  have collected on the internal hardware. Watch a QuickTime movie\n  demonstration of this procedure. (The movie is approximately 600 KB.)\n\n", "Q: Make trackpad quiet in Yosemite In El Capitan there is a setting that allows you to make the click of force touch trackpads (2015 MB. 2015 MBP) silent.\nI have tried this out in El Capitan public beta and liked it, however since I use my Yosemite drive as my main partition (because it's not buggy) is it possible to enable this feature on OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 such as a defaults write terminal command?\n\nA: I don't believe it is possible. Settings for the new trackpads don't exist in Yosemite. And the packaging for the new trackpad specifically states that it requires 10.11 (El Capitan). \n", "Q: Dual boot Linux Mint 17.1 with OS X Lion I have a 13' MacBook (2007, hw.model: 2,1) running OS X Lion (10.7). I wish to dual-boot Linux Mint 17.1 alongside OS X.  I created a Partition for Linux, and have also installed rEFIt (0.14).

I burnt 2 new DVDs, and also tested installing it on another machine, where it installed successfully.\nAny suggestions on how to resolve this are welcome.\n\nA: I have the same hardware and experienced the same problem. Booting from DVD and USB didn't work so I created a new partition on the hard drive, copied the Linux iso onto it and booted off that.  Got it installed ok but the fans were running all the time so I gave up on it in the end. \n", "Q: Using an early 2009 15\" macbook pro as a display for new, 13\" retina macbook pro I just purchases a 13\" retina macbook pro, and am loving it. However, I now have my old 15\" macbook pro lying around, and was wondering if it is possible to use it as a second display for my new machine. I haven't found anything online, and considering how old my 15\" MB Pro is, I have a hunch it might not be possible...\n\nA: You can use the program ScreenRecycler to use another Mac (or even a PC) as a second monitor. \nhttp://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n", "Q: Can I share HBO Now or Netflix while using iCloud Family Sharing? If two people use the same Apple ID for logging into \"iTunes & App Store\" on iOS, then they can share app purchases, including the purchase of in-app subscriptions like HBO Now (or Netflix).\nIf two people use separate Apple IDs for logging into \"iTunes & App Store\", but link the Apple IDs via iCloud Family Sharing, then they can still share app purchases. However, they cannot share in-app purchases.\nHBO Now (and Netflix) are in-app subscription purchases. So does this mean that, if I use iCloud Family Sharing, there is be no way to share a single subscription to HBO Now so that it can be used by everyone in my family?\nIs there a way around this, that allows the family to use iCloud Family Sharing but still allows everyone to be able to use HBO now from their devices?\n\nA: HBO-Now and Netflix are Internet services.\nOnce you have a account you can log in from everywhere and from any device that supports it. You do not have to be in the same geographical location to share.\n\nNo need for Apple ID, iCloud.\nThe maximum number of simultaneous connections is 3 for Netflix and HBO. If you need more connections (sharing) you can get it for small fee.\n", "Q: Should I just snap this metal bit off my iPhone 5? I'm trying to replace my iPhone 5 battery, but there's this one stupid stripped screw that won't come out of the bottom metal battery cover. Would it be a bad idea to just cut that metal cover off, and maybe replace it with electrical tape? I marked it with red in the picture.\n\n\nA: As a general rule given the low cost of having Apple replace the battery I would normally recommend this, it's then a official product with warranty.\nHowever as you've already got the part and opened the phone this is too late.. It looks like the cover you are trying to remove is the one over the battery connector, this is what prevents your battery from falling out, I don't think tape will cut it. I would suggest trying to get a small flat blade dug in to try and get that screw out and then get a replacement screw.\nBe very careful inside there, your handling an unprotected lithium battery, bending it, or puncturing it with the screw driver could result in a plume of horrible smoke and fire from the battery.\n", "Q: Install app on jailed iPhone, which is not available on App Store Is there a way to install an app, which is not available on the App Store, without doing a jailbreak?\n\nA: Unless the .ipa file is signed for Enterprise distribution or you have a provisioning profile for the app from the app's developer, you won't be able to install the app without jailbreaking.\n\nA: If the app was available you can restore the .ipa file. The app will show in the list of apps in iTunes on your iOS device and you choose to install.\nNote I have installed an app which is no longer in the App Store but which I had got from App Store some time before. I did this after I did a factory reset. I think these were the steps but this is from memory so the details might be wrong but you definitely can do it\n\nA: The only way you will be able to install it is if the application you want is open source.\nThis is because Apple has released Xcode 7 that now allows you to install applications to your iOS device without needing a developers account. The only down side is you cannot install IPAs or .apps this way as far as I know. This will NOT allow you to install jailbreak tweaks however. \n\nA: You can do it via Profiles, in setting if you install a new profile, you would be able to install apps that are not there in AppStore \nThat's how a Semi Jailbreak works, it doesn't exploit the iOS version completely. It installs a profile with which it installs Jailbreaking Package.\nTo know about Semi Jailbreak visit, http://m.pangu8.com/83.html\n", "Q: AppleScript choose file dialog box with default location not working So there goes four hours of my life that I will never get back.\nI'm trying to do something seemingly simple...\nI want to open a file select dialog box and specify the default location.\nI actually got this to work using the following...\nchoose file with prompt \"Please choose a file:\" of type {\"XLSX\", \"APPL\"} \ndefault location \"/Users/lowken/Dropbox/\"\n\nThis works and does exactly what I want (the file dialog opens up in the Dropbox folder).\nHowever when I try to use a string variable it doesn't work...\nset strPath to \"/Users/lowken/Dropbox/\"\n\nchoose file with prompt \"Please choose a file:\" of type {\"XLSX\", \"APPL\"} \ndefault location strPath\n\nNow the dialog box opens in the root directory of the hard drive :-(\nIt seems that the default location is being ignored however if the path is not correct Applescript does raise a error.\nI've tried casting the value as a string.

These emails are not marked as Junk, i.e. Mail does not think they are junk mail, does not highlight them in brown, etc.  They cannot be marked as \"Not Junk\" because Mail already thinks they aren't junk, despite moving them to the junk folder.  I can mark them as junk if I want and they highlight in brown as they should, but of course they're not junk so... don't want to do that.  I have to manually move them to my inbox every time.\nThis happens with many accounts coming into Mail, including multiple GMail accounts, multiple accounts using my own personal domain, and my Apple-issued me.com account.  So it's not a GMail or 3rd party server thing.\nI'm using IMAP for all accounts.  Junk filtering is enabled, \"trust junk headers in messages\" is disabled.  This has driven me nuts for years and I'm finally sick enough of it to post a question here.  It requires me to carefully scour my junk folder constantly - rendering the whole point of junk filtering moot.\nHow can I get valid mail to stop going to junk without setting custom rules for every single sender?\n\nA: It turns out that the solution was to log into icloud.com, find all the emails that keep being marked as junk (since they will actually appear as junk in icloud) and mark them as not junk.  Now mail.app correctly treats them as not junk and is no longer sending them (marked as not junk) to the junk folder.\n\nA: I would strongly suggest looking into the app SpamSieve, which functions in tandem with Apple Mail by assigning more stringent rules for sorting and which has a more advanced learning algorithm than that which is built in to Apple Mail. I've found SpamSieve to be pretty much flawless and am really glad it exists. It's kind of expensive, though; so you might try \"trusting junk headers\" or adding rules for those messages consistently incorrectly sorted first. The final option would of course be to try a different email client.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S dropped down the toilet I have dropped my iPhone down the toilet (it was in my back pocket) for some reason my new phone has not registered with iCloud and wouldn't load my old photos from the broken phone and they disappeared off of my iPad!\nI know stupid I should of backed it up... the question is how do I get my photos back?

I am using Boot Camp with the drivers made for previous Windows versions. I haven't had any issues with using it but after upgrading to an newer build I was needing to reinstall the driver package again to get it to work properly.\nAlso, as Steve Chambers said in his answer, it won't physically break or damage your Mac. Only remember that if you are upgrading from a previous Windows version, make a backup in case you need to go back or do a clean install. In addition, it could be a good idea to have the Windows drivers ready on a USB flash drive just in case.\nThis is tested with the latest TP (Technical Preview) build of Windows 10 but could change in the final version (unlikely but could). If you are not in a hurry, wait a week and then do a Google search and see if anyone had any issues with using the released Windows 10 version on Boot Camp.\n\nA: Rob has the gist of this because Apple has not released official Windows 10 drivers and installing Windows 10 on your Mac may or may not work.\nThat said often times you can use previous Windows version drivers on the next version. That often worked when Windows 7 came out, you could use Vista drivers and they usually worked.\nSo it is possible that installing Windows 10 by upgrading a working copy of Windows 8.1 would work. In fact we would all like to know if it did, or not. And what, if anything, did not work (EG sound, trackpad, video, etc.).\nSo you should be safe installing Windows 10 over top of 8.1. And it is unlikely that doing so will physically damage your Mac (YMMV) but you could very well make your current Windows installation unusable and have to reinstall.\n\nA: I upgraded to Windows 10 on a Macbook Pro 2013 model. Everything work fine except hotkeys.\nI reinstalled the apple keyboard driver and now those work!\nNote: drivers can be found at https://support.apple.com/downloads/DL1720/en_US/BootCamp5.1.5621.zip\n\nA: Upgraded to Windows 10 without any issues, ATI drivers will be replaced by standard Windows drivers and will limit you in extra options available for ATI Radeon R9, Sleep mode won't be available, also touch pad won't work properly as well.\n\nA: Apple just released the Bootcamp 6 for Windows 10.\n\nYou can use Boot Camp to install Windows 10 on supported Mac models\n  that have OS X Yosemite installed.  System Requirements\nYou need support software (drivers) installed with Boot Camp to use\n  Windows 10. This software is automatically downloaded when you use\n  Boot Camp Assistant. Boot Camp supports 64-bit versions of Windows 10\n  when used with a supported Mac.\nWindows 10 is available from Microsoft as an ISO file, an installation\n  DVD, and a USB flash drive. You need an ISO file of the 64-bit version\n  of the Windows 10 installer to install Windows on your Mac. If you\n  don't have an ISO file, you can use Disk Utility to make one from your\n  Windows installation DVD or USB flash drive. If you're installing\n  Windows for the first time, make sure the Windows installer you're\n  using is for a full installation (not an upgrade installer).\n\n", "Q: Cannot delete windows partition from mac I want to remove Windows from Mac and the I know the simple way is through the Boot Camp Assistant. But that doesn't work for me as follows:\n\nHowever, when I try to merge the partition of windows through disk utility, all buttons are inactive, and I cannot press either '-' or 'option' button, like follows:\n \nThen, I try to reinstall a new Mac osX from the internet by pressing and holding the [command]+[alt]+[R] when starting the computer, and it doesn't work either. I am informed that the system cannot be installed in either the BOOTCAMP partition or Untitled partition since they are not GUID partition table format.\nI am a newer to Mac and I just want to delete the Windows partition and add the space back to my osX partition. I wonder what should I do next? \nThanks for help!\n\nA: First of all, try both repair disk (if grayed, then verify), and repair disk permissions. If you are still unable, boot to single-user mode (Command +S  on boot) and type in the following.\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nPress enter, then type reboot.\nIf it still does not work, then do the following, but be sure to backup:\nHold Command +R  on boot to start Recovery mode, select disk utility and do it from there. If it is grayed out, select the partition scheme to 1 (or 2 if you need Untitled)\n\nWarning: There have been reports that setting the partition scheme to 1 or 2 can erase all your data. Be sure to backup before attempting to do this.\n\nA: Okay, so when I had a similar problem, I used Terminal, these two guides, and this command line to get it done.\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ NewName {first disk identifier in range} {last disk identifier in range}\n\nI used diskutil list to make sure I knew which drives I was merging, because you can't use the Disk Utility names (Macintosh HD, BOOTCAMP), you need the disk identifier (which looks like disk0, disk0s1, disk0s2, etc). I'm going to guess your HD would be disk0s2 and the BC is disk0s3, if that were true the next thing you'd put into Terminal is:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ NewName disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nThe JHFS+ will reformat the Windows drive when it merges and NewName should be replaced with whatever you wanna name your HD.\nMind you, doing the above should leave you with 2 partitions: NewName and Untitled. If you wanted to merge all three partitions then you would use HD and Untitled in your command line.\n\nA: Be careful \ndiskutil mergePartitions \nis very powerful -- if you have segment A and C and merge them it gets rid of B (merges that too) -- and other very funky repercussions. So be careful.\nIt ultimately helped me get rid of the xfat partition but it was tricky. \n", "Q: Want to keep Notes only on my iPhone 6 I want to keep my Notes only on my iPhone 6 and not have them appear in my mail account but I have been unable to disable notes without deleting them from my iPhone. I tried to find the On My iPhone option in Notes settings to set the default account but it is not there, nor is it available in Mail, Contacts, and Calendar settings. Please advise.\n\nA: If the notes are associated with your email account you'll have to copy them somewhere (you can email them, send them as text, iMessage,  copy and paste them but only one by one), delete them —which will happen automatically when you disable them on Settings > Mail, contacts, calendars— and then add them back to reside exclusively on your iPhone.\nConsider making regular backups of your device, because if anything happens to it, that will be your only way of recovering them. \n", "Q: Make Caps Lock behave like in Windows I use VoIP programs, and I use Caps Lock for Push-To-Talk (PTT) on those. The problem I experience is that when I push Caps Lock, I toggle the Push-To-Talk, which means that if I release Caps Lock, PTT is still on, and I have to push the button again to stop PTT. While on Windows this works fine, I have to hold down Caps Lock to talk. Any idea how I can make it so that I need to hold down Caps Lock on OSX as well?\n\nA: I used Seil (OSX app to manipulate caps lock) to rebind Caps Lock to F13, and I bound F13 to PTT, so now it works.\n", "Q: Bottom row of system preferences (third party apps) not showing In OSX Yosemite I used to have a bottom row of third party preference applets that contained Java, Flash, Air Display etc in System Preferences. This is no longer showing. How do I turn it back on? (I've spent ages googling but not found an answer).\nthanks!\n\nA: I installed homebrew http://brew.sh/ and osquery https://osquery.io/. Then did\nselect * from preferences where domain like \"%system%\";\n\nwhich showed a list of preference settings that might be interesting. ThirdPartyCount was 0, which I thought was wrong. So I backed up ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist and used XCode to edit the value to 3 (which is the value I expected). After a reboot it went back to zero.\nAfter more googling, I found /Library/PreferencePanes contains third party preference panes. The aliases in there were all broken: because I'd manually deleted browser plugins from \"/Library/Internet Plug-ins\". So i deleted the really-dead aliases, re-installed Java and now the bottom row is displaying as expected.

Anything obvious I'm missing ?\n\nA: I believe iBooks will load up and view PDFs and if you are signed into iCloud on all devices the last read page should sync between devices.\nI stand corrected this does not seem to work, grrrr... I thought I remembered it working, sorry. I have no other suggestions other than to try other PDF readers on the app store. You might also want to ask the hive mind at macintouch.com. It often has solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems.\n", "Q: How do you get terminal to echo / print all key strokes? Looking to see what the terminal gets when you press keystrokes such as alt+a or whatever.\nI remember there was a really simple way to do this with a one line command and without installing any extra software, but I can't seem to find it again. \nAny one know?\n\nA: Found it \nsed -n l\nReally useful for debugging problems with terminal programs that benefit from complex bindings like vim.\nOr just use cat or sed\n", "Q: Unable to open the MacBook Pro mid-2014 lid with single hand I have got a MacBook Pro with Retina display Mid-2014 model. I cannot open the lid of the device without putting one hand at the bottom and other on the lid, which was not the case few months ago. I purchased this machine last year in the month of October and only a week ago it was the Apple service center for the same issue. Folks there cleaned it and said to me that they can't loose it up any further. \nMy question is, Is this normal?\n\nA: No, you should be able to open the machine without using two hands by simply lifting the screen, you may find the machine lifts off a little, but it should open without two hands, if not then there is something wrong, but that doesn't meant they aren't wrong, perhaps it is not fixable without replacing a fair chunk of the machine.\n", "Q: Should services be turned off prior to performing updates? Let's say you want to upgrade your OS X server from Yosemite 10.10.1 to 10.10.2. Should you turn off OS X Server services prior to the upgrade?\nShould you also turn off when upgrading from Server.app 4.0 to 4.1?\nI can't seem to find any Apple documentation that suggests to do it but then again, Apple documentation seems limited in a lot of regards.\n\nA: Most likely an upgrade like that will behave like Java updates do in macs. It will replace the software in the background and won't start using the new software until you restart the program. \nIn terms of best practices, I would say go ahead and update it with services still running and as soon as it's done, restart the machine to give it a fresh run.\n", "Q: How to minimise the terminal automatically when it is running a shell script? I have a shell script which runs a Python Program. I created the shell script so that the users of my program may simply double click it to run my program.\nWhen the shell script is executed; the terminal loads in front of the GUI of the Python Program and that is bothersome. Is there anyway to ensure that the Terminal is minimised by default when the shell script runs?\n\nA: Ok. So I found out a solution.\nTurns you can simply use Automator and save the shell script as an App.\nJust open Automator; select \"Applications\" and then \"Run a Shell Script\"\n", "Q: fs_usage returns a LOT of ioctl lines I've been reading up on interesting Terminal commands (I've used it forever, but there's always more to learn) when I ran across this.

It would also be nice to specify a service or process for which to return information.\nHave I misread the usefulness of this function? Is there a way to get rid of those numerous WindowServer calls? Can I specify the processes in which I'm interested?\n\nA: All that is possible by using fs_usage with several options. You may also pipe it to grep to further restrict the output.\nTo exclude a process or a pid (and also fs_usage itself) use the -e option:\nsudo fs_usage -e WindowsServer\nsudo fs_usage -e 123\n\nSpecifying the -f option turns on output filtering based on the mode provided.\nThe possible modes are:  \nnetwork    Network-related events are displayed.  \nfilesys    Filesystem-related events are displayed.  \npathname   Pathname-related events are displayed.  \nexec       Exec and spawn events are displayed.  \ndiskio     Disk I/O events are displayed.  \ncachehit   In addition, show cache hits.  \n\nExample: \nsudo fs_usage -e WindowsServer -f filesys\n\nTo just show a special pid/command and exclude all other, use the pid (enter ps aux to get it) or the name of the command or application\nExamples:\nsudo fs_usage -f filesys Terminal\nsudo fs_usage -f filesys 178\n\nA different possibility is to pipe the output of fs_usage to grep:\nsudo fs_usage -e -f filesys|grep Terminal\nsudo fs_usage -e -f filesys|grep -v grep|grep write\nsudo fs_usage -e|grep -v grep|grep -v WindowsServer|grep ioctl\n\nThe part grep -v grep or grep -v WindowsServer excludes \"grep\" and/or \"WindowsServer\" from occurring in the result.\nSources:\nApple developer\nRentzsch\n", "Q: Set the WorkingDirectory to user's home in launchd?

My question is rather simple. Why I can't delete the imported images in my iPhone from Photos??? I was able to do that in the old iPhotos.\nRunning on version: 1.0.1 (215.65.0)\n\n\nA: In Photos you have an option to \"delete items after import\" near the imports buttons, in the top right corner\n\nIn Photos on the other corner I have \"Open photos from this device checked\"\n\nTry to keep up to date Yosemite, Itunes and Photos.

I have a 1.25TB partition that I use for Time Machine backups. When I am in the system preferences for Time Machine on my Mac, it states there's 525GB of 1.25TB available. But when I browse to the partition, there's only two sparse disk image bundles present (one for my wife's laptop and one for mine), and the total size between the two of them is only 83GB. So why does Time Machine think there's already almost 750GB of disk space already being used?

Thus it doesn't delete saved filesystem-objects that are changed on the source, but rather adds them up. Time Machine offers an interface that let's you browse through your backup history. You can access it through context-menu of the Time Machine-icon in the menu bar. If it ain't there, you can activate it in the system preferences.\n", "Q: Setting background image to dropbox file doesn't update background Im trying to have my desktop background be an image stored on my dropbox account. My dropbox folder is linked in my home directory. When i set the background to this photo and then change the photo the background doesn't follow. I know the file has changed by opening in Finder.\nIf I reboot the machine the image changes so it must be cached somewhere? \n\nA: You're right, it is cached. So if you want to change the desktop image, you'll need to change the db file. In Yosemite, that is ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db\nAnd here's a way to change it using the Terminal:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db \"update data set value = '/path/to/your/image.jpg'\" && killall Dock\n\nSo, if you want to run that after a file have changed (such as modyfing it through dropbox) you could use a file watcher script, such as this Ruby one.\n\nA: The previous method works, but there also is another (a little bit brutal) way.\nYou need LaunchAgent to monitor the file that is changing and execute an action when it is changed.\nSave the following to a file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/, you can use as filename 'com.yourname.programname.plist'). Replace /full/path/to/desktoppicture\n with the full path to the picture in your Dropbox folder.\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n    <plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.yourname.programname</string>\n        <key>Program</key>\n        <string>/usr/bin/killall</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>killall</string>\n            <string>Dock</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>WatchPaths</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/full/path/to/your/desktoppicture</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n    </plist>\n\nAfter you modified and saved the property list, open the Terminal and type:\nlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.programname.plist\n\n(replacing yourname.programname with whatever you called the plist file).\nAt this point, any time that the file is changed, killall Dock will be executed, quitting the Dock app and forcing a Desktop refresh. This is a bit brutal, and could be annoying since the Dock/Desktop refresh takes ~1 second and while it does you cannot use Mission Control and Dashboard, but it should be automatic.\nIn case you want to uninstall the LaunchAgent, first type:\nlaunchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.programname.plist\n\n(again, renaming the file to match yours), and then remove the plist file from ~/LaunchAgents/\n", "Q: How to ungroup compilations on iPhone Music? I have several \"compilation\" albums, or albums with more than one artist, in my music library.\nOn the iTunes app in my computer, I can set \"Group Compilations\" option off to ungroup the compilations in my library; in other words, it makes those songs show up under the specific artist instead of under \"Various Artists.\"\nHowever, this isn't the case on my iPhone. In my Music app, those compilation songs don't show up under their respective artists; they show up under the \"Compilations\" tab instead.\nIs there a way to turn a \"Group Compilations\" setting off on the iPhone, like you can do in iTunes?\n\nA: fingaz's answer is not quite correct—they are talking about when you uncheck the \"compilation\" box in the Get Info window in iTunes, not turning off \"Group Compilations\".\nThe short answer is no, at least not at this time. If you want them to not be grouped as a separate \"artist\", you would need to alter the metadata in iTunes such that they aren't compilations any more. If this is a feature you would like to see in the Music app, you can tell Apple yourself on this page. \n\nA: The music is synced from the computer and the iPhone is just mimicking the computers library. Once these changes have been made on the computer you will need to sync the iPhone with the computer again.\nThe reason why there is not a solution on the phone is from the user interface not including an editing option for metadata, which is what is being changed on the computer. I personally feel this would convolute the interface, especially with Apple Music now available.\n", "Q: OS X client to OD if master is down When joining an OS X client to OD, it seems you use the server of the master OD. However, if the master is down for reboot or maintenance, how does the client know to contact the OD slave?\nWould it be advised to create a DNS entry, lets say od.example.com, list both server IP's in the A record?\n\nA: You should specifically not try to do any DNS or similar trickery to achieve failover. The way OD failover works is that the OD data includes configuration records listing all of the OD servers (master and replicas). The clients store (& periodically update) copies of this list, so if they ever have trouble contacting their primary server (generally the one they were told to bind to), they have a ready list of other servers to try.\n(It's actually more complicated than this if you have locales defined, since that overrides the basic server list. But the same principles apply; just define the locales in OD, and the clients will automatically download the info they need.)\n", "Q: iPhone 4S CDMA updating and activating I live in Iran and I want to buy a CDMA iPhone 4S.I know that I won't be able to use CDMA network and I have no problem with that.Basically I want to have an iPhone but use it as an iPod because I can only afford the money of a CDMA iPhone.GSM models are much more expensive and I have two other cell phone so I have no problem with not having a network in my iPhone.\nNow, I have few questions:\nIf a CDMA iPhone is updated but not in range of the CDMA network,will it be deactivated ? I mean when I update a running and usable CDMA iPhone 4S which has no network,will it become deactivated after the update ? If it becomes deactivated,is there any way to make it activated and usable without being in the CDMA network range ?\nI searched for iOS 8 update for iPhone 4S CDMA but I only found \"Iphone 4S\" title, not iPhone 4s CDMA, check this link : http://www.iphonehacks.com/download-iphone-ios-firmware\nAll other GSM and CDMA iPhones and iPads have their own dedicated update but there is only iPhone 4S title,no GSM,and no CDMA. \nDoes this mean that for iPhone 4S there is only one update that works on both GSM and CDMA versions ? \n\nA: Every iPhone requires a network ID (whether this is a SIM card or eePROM chip or whatever is irrelevant). Essentially, so long as the phone thinks there is a possibility of it getting a network connection, you're fine. \n", "Q: Failed downgrade - iPod touch with broken home button I tried to downgrade my iPod touch 4th gen iOS 6.1.6 to iOS 5.1.1.\nI went on Redsn0w clicking extras/even more/restore/ipsw. Then I selected iOS 5.1.1 firmware. I stopped the process halfway. Now my iPod's screen is black and when I plug it into iTunes the device is not recognised.\nThe problem is that my home button is broken so I cannot press the power and home button to make the screen light up with the apple logo.\nWhat can I do now to fix this issue?\n\nA: You need to get your device into a state called Recovery Mode, and then iTunes will automatically detect your device and let you restore to the latest iOS. For an iPod touch 4th gen, there are a few tools that can get your device into Recovery Mode for you without the use of hardware buttons. The best ways are to use redsn0w or iRecovery, but the steps are really complicated to use those utilities. There is a tool called RecBoot that claims to work, but I haven't used it, so I can't speak to it.\nEdit: I actually had to use RecBoot the other day, and it worked great.\n", "Q: Prevent Automatic Installation of iOS Update I know that iOS devices will automatically download the latest version of iOS when it's available. A message then appears, asking if the user wants to install the update later or now.\nI have 2 questions regarding this: One, if I click \"later,\" will I receive the message again, and how frequently would I receive this message?\nAnd two, if I restart my iOS device, would the new version of iOS be automatically installed when it turns back on?\n\nA: For iOS 7 -> 8\nYou do not receive the message again, but the update is available through the Settings app. \nDevice restarts do not cause update installation. \nSource: my wife's iPhone 5S, which went weeks and multiple reboots without installing 8.4\nFor iOS 9\nI believe iOS 9 will prompt you daily (I upgraded immediately, but I am basing this on the comments below). However, rebooting will still not cause the update to install.\n\nA: System upgrade has nothing to do with the reboot process. No matter if it's automatically pulled and just wait for your green light to be installed. You can safely reboot your device without being worried that it will upgrade the iOS.\n", "Q: OS X client gets SSL certificate error when trying to join OD I switched from self signed to signing my own certificates using a CA I created on the server. OS X Server has a list of the certificates outlined in blue now for its hostname, Code Signing Certificate, and OD Intermediate CA.

It is the email account that you enter when you log into your account or when you try to buy something on the iTunes store.\n2.Alternative Email Addresses - These are addresses that you set up for your account that are also associated with your Apple ID. They are usually an @icloud.com or an @me.com. It is possible that the email is there, but you probably would have seen and removed it from there.\n3.Notification Email Address - This one is towards the bottom of the page and may have been missed, especially if you updated on a MacBook or laptop screen. Your notification email address will be used in addition to your primary email address to notify you when changes are made to your account.\nIf it is not in any of these three places on your Apple Account, then you may need to get in touch with Apple Support.\nYou can also go to the mail settings and click off the notifications emails from Apple, that way they don't come to you.\nOne other possibility is that if you at some point in time had two Apple IDs or that someone else had your email on their account (family member, etc.), it could be possible that that one is still active and has the email you are receiving emails from on. So if you had a personal Apple ID and one for work or one for a sibling, maybe the email you do not want to receive emails form anymore is set there. \nBest of Luck.\n", "Q: Text messages sent via iMessage Did a backup(not restore) of iPad and now my messages sent from iPad do not show up on iPhone - also messages sent from iPad show up as my email not my phone#\n\nA: Check the messages settings.

I would like to know how often my boyfriend checks where I am. Is it possible to be notified when he checks on me? In the country where I live, Find My Friends is not available.\n\nA: Unfortunately no,\nFind My Friend is a one way communication style app. It allows you to notify people of your location and see their location. Also, you have the ability to notify someone when you arrive, leave a place, or you can send your current location. You can also be notified if someone lease or arrives at a place (and they can do the same), however it does not have the ability to notify you if someone requested your location.\n", "Q: Can the Macbook Pro drive two Ultra HD monitors at 60FPS each? I'm referring to the 2015 Macbook Pro, 15-inch, with the AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory. Can this drive two Ultra HD monitors (3840 x 2160) at 60FPS each? If so, would you be able to simultaneously use the built-in display?\nTo be clear, I'm referring to SST (single-stream transport) monitors, not MST (multi-stream transport).\nYou'd have to plug each monitor into a Thunderbolt port, since HDMI supports only 30FPS. Are both Thunderbolt ports on different Thunderbolt buses, or the same? In the latter case, there may not be enough bandwidth.\n\nA: According to this document https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154 The MacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Early 2011) and later have Thunderbolt2 and can handle two thunderbolt displays (2560x1440).\nAccording to this document https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856 The MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013 and later) can handle one MST 4K display at 60Hz.\nYou can run one 4K monitor off of the Thunderbolt display at 60z and a second off HDMI at 30Hz. the two thunderbolt ports are connected. Once you try to connect a second 4K monitor to the other port, you will go over the bandwidth and the second monitor will go dark.\n\nA: I was only able to get 60 fps at 2560 on my MacBook 13\" from 2015.\nYou should try hacking around in the Terminal with cscreen.

Our client's employees all have iPhone 6s. They don't share phones, and have never used each others, but strangely, as one user tries to download an app at the App store, it then asks for a completely different persons' iCloud password. The only thing these phones share is a WiFi network, and mail accounts on an Exchange server.\nThis has happened to two other phones within the same client employees. One of the phones actually asked for a completely different client iCloud password, even though these two people have never met before.\nWhy does this keep happening?\nUpdate: I have answered this myself, and marked as the correct answer because that is exactly what were happening.\n\nA: Is this an enterprise setup? How are the phones being managed? MaaS360, OS X Server, ect? \nIt sounds like the users are connected to the same App Store ID and all have different iCloud accounts they are logged into (or vice versa).\n\nA: The answer was actually to do with the silly way Apple works when you run a backup with iTunes.\nPerson A backs up their iPhone which has an app called \"Whatsapp\".\nPerson B then backs up their iPhone which also has the same app. (Itunes will not backup Whatsapp as Person A already has). \nPerson B later restores their iPhone from their own backup.\nSilly iTunes then uses Person A's backed up copy of Whatsapp to restore onto Person B's iPhone, which later causes the password prompt when performing updates.\nWe used the same laptop's and desktops to backup iPhones when going from iPhone 5 to 6, which caused this problem to happen all over the place.\nEDIT: YES this is 100% what is happening which is why it is the answer, not sure why the down-vote, but probably from the unhappy guy in the comments that didn't like me calling his precious iTunes \"silly\". If you have the problem I had in the question, then this is the answer for it.\n", "Q: Printing out weird code instead of actual print jobs I support a few macs for our staff and one of the macs in question starting having an issue where when the job would reach the printer instead of the job printing out, a bunch of jumbled code would print out instead. This has happened on multiple printers even after removing all current printers and resetting the printing system on the OS and adding the printers again fresh. I haven't been able to find anything about an issue like this on the net yet and was hoping for a solution short of wiping and re-imaging the HDD.\nBoth Word 2011 and webpages viewed from Safari were sent as test print jobs. The OS is 10.9.5 and both printers are Ricoh models, though different ones. I specifically downloaded the correct drivers and both were setup via LDP and IP address.\nI have tried physically deleting all printer drivers from the library folder and was prompted to download and reinstall the printer drivers as I setup the printers again to test but the same issue happened again.\nHere is an example of what happens.\nA simple word 2011 document with only the words: test print\nreturns this\n\n%!PS-Adobe-3.0\n\n%APL_DSC_Encoding: UTF8\n\n%APLProducer: (Version 10.9.5 (Build 13f109\n\n\n\n14 blank pages\n\n14 dict begin/FontName /KUFZPG+Cambria def\n/PaintType 0 def\n\nthen a bunch of dup callouts and multi-line string of alphanumeric characters and the closing brackets on those opening tags.\n\n/Encoding 256 array 0 1 255[index exch/ .notdef put}for\n\n\nA: That 'weird code' is actually PostScript, and is the raw data of the print job. \nIf this is a large network printer, these models very often have different LPD queues to which you can send the job. These can define the expected input data. (E.g. my HP 5200 has \"RAW\", \"AUTO\", \"BINPS\", and \"TEXT\" as LPD queues.) Check the manual of the printer, and see what print queues are offered, and make sure you configure the 'Printer' in MacOS to send to a particular queue.\n", "Q: Are finder tags case-sensitive? OS X Mavericks introduced file tagging to Finder and the filesystem. Are these tags case-senstive? For example, could I have an Apple and apple tag?\n\nA: No.\nI am able to seemingly tag files with differently cased words by opening the Get Info window on each file in Finder. However after I save and close each window and inspect the tags for each file the tag that was saved first overrides the other differently cased tag.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: this is with the default case-insensitive filesystem. I have not tested this on a case-sensentive filesystem.\n\n", "Q: Using an old Windows keyboard on a Macbook I recently found my old mechanical keyboard and I want to use it on my Macbook Pro. It still uses an old PS2 connector so I went out and bought a PS2 to USB adapter. \nWhen I plug it in, the lock lights on the side simply light up once and then I can't use it. The keys do not work and the keyboard identifier utility from System Preferences does not recognize it.\nI'm guessing I need some sort of driver but where can I find it? It's an old A4Tech KeyWorks Office keyboard.\n\nA: I have heard that all USB/PS2 adapters are not created equal. Some work some don't. But you would probably cost yourself more time and effort getting a working adapter than just buying a cheap PC USB keyboard.\nI use PC USB keyboards on Macs all the time and they work a treat. I can get a used (Dell) USB keyboard locally for about twelve bucks. As cheap as they are you could spend that on two adapters easily, not to mention time spent futzing with it...\n", "Q: How to turn off iPhone 5 without having to use the screen or buttons My buttons are broken and my phone is locked how do I turn it off and turn it back on again? \n\nA: Let the battery die, that will shut down the phone. Once dead and off, plugging the phone in to charge will turn it back on. This is assuming both the power and home buttons do not work.\n\nA: Try plugging it into a new PC when it asks Allow/ Disallow, it definitely come to slide to unlock screen, then go to Settings>General>Auto-Lock>Never.\n\nA: Simply manually disconnect the battery by removing the two bottom screws and then lifting the screen.\nOnce screen is up, unscrew the 3 battery connector shield screws and then disconnect battery flex.

The new machine is a 2015 Retina also running Yosemite. \nThe first time round I tried doing this via a Thunderbolt cable. The donor machine was booted into target mode, and on the recipient machine I started up the Migration Assistant and followed all the instructions. When the time remaining bar got down to about a minute, it started to creep back up. \nIt kept going and going. I left it for an hour and a half (bearing in mind the transfer up until then had taken 20 minutes). It had reached about 17 hours by the time I decided to give up. \nI then formatted the drive and reinstalled Yosemite via the Internet. So starting with a clean state I tried again with method 2 which was via a Timemachine backup. This had exactly the same effect. I'm going to leave it overnight in vein hope that something might happen, however I thought that I might as well ask on here to see if there are any suggestions.\nThis is similar to another question, New Mac Pro: Setup/Migration Assistant never finishes, and one piece of advice from that is that I should just boot into target mode and manually copy files over. I may well end up doing that, although obviously I don't want to miss anything.\n\nA: I'd have taken both machines up to 10.10.4 first using the combo updater - as it specifically includes fixes for Migration Assistant.  \nThen I'd have followed the instructions rather than try it in target disk mode - you need to be running Migration Assistant on both machines, as you must authorise on both. \nI've successfully migrated two machines in the past month, one from 10.10.4 to 10.10.4  ...the other from Windows XP… & if it can do that, it can do anything ;-)\n", "Q: Using Automator to call a Service I use save my PDFs to my Evernote account.

Any ideas how to fix this?\nThere are no error messages, photos sync just ok but music does not appear on the iPhone after syncing or clicking Autofill button. iTunes version is 12.2.1. iPhone is on iOS 8.4.\n\nA: So I figured what was the problem. First of all its not family sharing but new Apple music which is in the cloud now and prevents from downloading songs from iTunes to your iPhone. So if you go to Settings --> Music and disable Show Apple music it restores the ability to transfer songs in old fashion from iTunes.

I can do this by pressing buttons in Finder or I can do this form a shell with a command that looks like this:\nmount -t afp afp://user:password@domain.tld/location /Volumes/mntpnt\n\nThis lets me automate connecting to the server but now I have a password saved in a plaintext shell script. What's a better way to automate this? My goal is to automatically allow Time Machine to access the Linux Machine if it can be reached.\nTo automate something like this with SSH I would authenticate with a passwordless key. Is there a way to do that with AFP?\nI also have the password in my OS X keychain and I'm not prompted for a password if I go through Finder to connect to the Linux machine. Is there a sensible way to access to use this from a shell script?\nI can provide more info about the Netatalk setup if that helps but it seems like the issue is on the client side.\n\nA: Here's how you can pull the password out of the Keychain in OS X.\npw=$(security find-internet-password -wl mntpt)\n\nThis presumes the item is stored in the keychain with the name \"mntpt\"\nThen you should be able to use your script on the next line:\nmount -t afp afp://user:$pw@domain.tld/location /Volumes/mntpnt\n\n", "Q: Dialog I cannot get rid of The steps here were simple, but unexpected:\n\n\n*\n\n*download a file\n\n*in finder, rename the file using Keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Enter to start rename\n\n*Start typing a new name (but not pressing Enter again)\n\n\n*Try to open the file by pressing Command-O\nNow this dialog appears and won't go away (it only reacts on moving with the mouse, but clicking on it fails, just as pressing Spacebar, Enter or Esc).\nBoth Finder and Spotlight now refuse to open any other file.\nI tried:\nkillall -KILL Dock\nkillall -KILL Finder\nkillall -KILL NotificationCenter\nkillall -KILL SystemUIServer\n\nHelp (:\nNote the file is not damaged, just renamed.\n\n\nA: Search for OS X identify process by window I found What process owns a certain window (Mac OS X) which told me this after moving the Window:\nRetinaMBPro1TB:bin jeroenp$ ./show-recently-moved-windows.py \nMove target window\n\nList of windows that moved:\n{(\n        {\n        kCGWindowAlpha = 1;\n        kCGWindowBounds =         {\n            Height = 1094;\n            Width = 1130;\n            X = 43;\n            Y = 45;\n        };\n        kCGWindowIsOnscreen = 1;\n        kCGWindowLayer = 0;\n        kCGWindowMemoryUsage = 5246548;\n        kCGWindowName = \"bin \\U2014 Python \\U2014 160\\U00d776\";\n        kCGWindowNumber = 23921;\n        kCGWindowOwnerName = Terminal;\n        kCGWindowOwnerPID = 357;\n        kCGWindowSharingState = 1;\n        kCGWindowStoreType = 2;\n    },\n        {\n        kCGWindowAlpha = 1;\n        kCGWindowBounds =         {\n            Height = 153;\n            Width = 420;\n            X = 1359;\n            Y = 182;\n        };\n        kCGWindowIsOnscreen = 1;\n        kCGWindowLayer = 8;\n        kCGWindowMemoryUsage = 390292;\n        kCGWindowName = \"\";\n        kCGWindowNumber = 23246;\n        kCGWindowOwnerName = CoreServicesUIAgent;\n        kCGWindowOwnerPID = 87976;\n        kCGWindowSharingState = 1;\n        kCGWindowStoreType = 2;\n    }\n)}\n\nSince CoreServicesUIAgent is the owner, I performed this:\nkillall -KILL CoreServicesUIAgent\n\nThat worked.

I like to keep my iTunes library ('My Music') clean and only add albums I really like. However, I also like to have playlists with songs I just like a bit. I do not want these songs to show up in 'My Music'.\nWhen adding a song to a playlist in Apple Music, it's automatically added to 'My Music'. When removing it from 'My Music', it's also removed from the playlist.\nIs there some way to add a song to a playlist, while not adding it to 'My Music'?\n\nA: Apple has added this ability in the most recent versions of their apps:\nAdd a song to a playlist in Apple Music without adding it to your library\nWhat’s New in iTunes 12.3.3\n\nA: iTunes treats tracks now the same way it treated tracks before the introduction of Apple Music: you can't put a song into a playlist unless it's in your music library. Before Apple Music, this was common sense; how could you have a song in a playlist if you don't even have it in your library?\nIf you absolutely need this behavior, Spotify as an alternative does NOT behave this way. Spotify's \"Your Music\" library and Spotify playlists stay completely separate. This effectively makes the \"Your Music\" library one big unordered playlist.\n", "Q: Launching Character Viewer (aka CharacterPalette) from command line So, recently I have being using the Character and Keyboard Viewer a fair bit and set up simple Alfred keywords that toggle the launch/quitting of these apps so as not to have to leave the keyboard.\nThis works splendidly for Keyboard Viewer running the applescript:\n    if application \"KeyboardViewer\" is running then\n    tell application \"KeyboardViewer\" to quit\nelse\n    tell application \"KeyboardViewer\" to activate\nend if\n\nBut the same for \"CharacterPalatte\" (Character Viewer) which launches OK according to Activity Monitor does not show show the window!\nThe Character Viewer window is nowhere to be seen.

Actually, I don't want OS X to make it unusually difficult for me to use my software, ever. Is it possible to make this selection permanent?\n\nA: It took me some time to figure this out but you can disable it through a global preference using the terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security GKAutoRearm -bool NO\n\nThis will disable the auto rearming of the Gatekeeper in OS X.

I'm a really perceptive guy but in this case I cannot see any icon with a paper clip symbol or anything similar that would suggest that I can attach something.\n\n\nA: Press and hold anywhere on the text area.

This question (unix.stackexchange.com) is similar to yours and has a couple of good answers.\n\nA: Seem like typical answers that others have heard in days gone by so they repeat them without a second thought and with zero evidence to support their conclusions which are just regurgitation.\nI don't think full boot log messages are stored anywhere actually since they predate the dawn of your OS itself and would need to be stored in NVRAM or something similar then copied into the system's memory. Which is probably why you won't find the actual boot log from blah blah Property of The Regents of the University of California etc..\nWhat you can do is using boot-args (like what safe mode is) to see what is going on. The best I can say to catch everything is use your phone's video camera of slow-mo to catch everything. Boot into Recovery Mode and open the Terminal under Utilities and type\nnvram boot-args=\"debug=0x144e kextlog=0xffffffff -s -v -x\"\n\nYou may wish to use a different debug= value, there's plenty of info out there as to what various values do. You can adjust the f's after kextlog between 1 and 8 total to increase or decrease verbosity of what's noted during booting 0xffffffff (8 f's) is the most verbose, -s for single user, -v for verbose mode, -x for safe boot. Remove -x -s if you'd like but it's best to leave -x in there for the full effect. Boot back into Recovery Mode and type nvram boot-args= to clear out these settings and return to normal. \nI do not recommend this for the faint of heart... \n", "Q: Will Mac OSX 10.5.4 or 10.5.8 run on a PowerMac g5 quad? I would like to know because I am going to get the highest version that will run on this specific Mac...\n\nA: According to Mactracker, the latest version of Mac OS X any version of an Apple Power Mac G5 Desktop can take is Mac OS X 10.5.8 although Mac OS X 10.5.4 will also run on them.\nThe information I presented was what is reported by Mactracker and they usually are correct with the information they provide.  In any case all sources I've looked at for the Power Mac G5 Quad 2.5GHz M9592LL/A PowerMac11,2 the only quad core Power Mac G5 produced all say the same thing, latest or maximum OS is \"Mac OS X 10.5.8\".  Unfourtunatly Apple's own page Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) - Technical Specifications does not say. So I guess the answer should be contact Apple via phone or stop by an Apple store for what would be considered an authoritative source.\n", "Q: My macbook pro troubleshoot reset with grey screen My macbook pro is MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012), 8G ram, and run OS 10.10.4.\nI have upgraded storage from 500GB HDD to Crucial M550 SSD. I removed dvd drive and use optical bay to keep 500GB HDD as the second storage.\nI have reinstalled my OSX after upgraded\nAfter upgraded, my macbook pro temperature alway hot (>70 C degree) when I open a lot of applications and a lot of chrome tab.\nSometime My macbook pro auto reset with grey screen \n \nPlease help me. I can work with this situation. \nThank you.\n\nA: The first rule of computer troubleshooting: \"isolate and identify.\"\nWhich basically means undo any changes you made recently. If you plugged a new mouse in, remove it. If you installed a new app, remove it, etc.\nIn your case I would remove the drive in the optical bay and put the Apple optical drive back in and see if the issue repeats.\nUser \"n1000\" hints that it might be related to an OS upgrade or your specific model of Mac. If you can go back to the previous version of the OS that would be good (though time consuming).\nYou could also take the Mac to an Apple store and have a Genius run some diagnostics and see if it is a warranty or known issue. Note, Apple will blame the SSD in the optical bay so you will have to put the optical drive back in for Apple to diagnose the issue beyond blaming the SSD and sending you on your way.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Yosemite using too much RAM... Why? I think its a problem probably because of this CleanMyMac 3 app that says i have got only 100mb from my 8gb and when I click on \"Free Up\" I get more than 3gb free RAM only to fill it again after a while. The only thing feels slow on my system is when I enable the Transparency effects the minimizing and dragging the apps windows seems utterly slow (lagging). \nI tried to install fresh copy of Yosemite and it was smoother and the lag was gone but I have to use this system so restored it. That's why I think some apps are causing this issue?\n\nAs you can see only 100MB of RAM is free!\n\nMy Mac specs:\n\nEtreCheck report as advised:\nhttp://pastebin.com/rxuGqef6\n\nA: Free RAM is wasted RAM. It is electrically powered regardless of its contents.\nYour screen shot shows 2.52gb of cache[1], 0.375gb of compressed memory and 0.574gb of swap.\nThe 2.52gb of cache will be assigned to processes that ask for more memory. The difference between the \"new\" way and the \"old\" way is that the contents of \"freed\" memory is tracked.\nApps that \"free up\" memory just flush the cache - meaning they cause the operating system to forget what was in memory (the actual contents are not cleared) and all requests for the previously cached items have to wait for the data to load from disk. You won't usually notice this penalty in a big way, but the system will feel slower.\nLess than a gb of swap is nothing, but if you see this number increasing while cache memory is near zero (which should show yellow or red memory pressure) it is a sign that something is making heavy demands for memory.\nAs for compressed memory, CPUs are so fast now that its actually faster to compress and decompress data than it is to wait for data to load from disk. As memory pressure increases, the OS will compress the memory to meet demands instead of swapping.\nFor more information on understanding what Activity Monitor shows, see:\nActivity Monitor: Determine if your Mac could use more RAM\nActivity Monitor: View memory usage\n1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)\n\nA: Try to avoid using Chrome, Safari works quite well on Mac OS X Yosemite. If it still an issue you might try NVRAM and SMC reset to see if it helps eliavte the problem. However more information is needed as to why your Mac is using so much ram. Use etrecheck(google it) and post the log here.\nNvram and SMC reset instructions:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204063\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295\n\nA: Ok, you need to look at the whole picture.\nIn the old days (not so long ago) one had to worry to keep free RAM.\nNow days systems do the opposite. They use full RAM available, but then manage it so that the system operates at maximum efficiency = memory pressure.\nIf you look at the Compressed RAM, those are files that you used, but not currently using (so it is compressed, but still there for fast acesss\nYour Memory pressure is in Green (good sign).\nThe one to pay attention to is the SWAP, That is when system uses the hard drive as extended RAM when not enough RAM is available. With todays SSD drives that is almost not noticeable in processing speed (not so with Hard Drives). Your SWAP is minimal.\nNow lets look at the big consumers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel task- almost normal\n\n*SystemUIserver- way to high ? (something not right here)\n\n*discoveryd- way to high ? that is your Spotlight (disk indexing)\n\n*Google Chrome uses almost 1 Gig of your RAM (combined), but that is normal depending how many tabs you have open.\nLets try to fix the problem with your systemuiserver. Sometimes it is caused by menu bar extras.\nIn Terminal use the killall -KILL SystemUIServer and see if it drops in memory consumption. If not, you need to disable some of your menu bar extras.\n", "Q: How can I set the region in Terminal I want to change the Region via Terminal.\nHow can I do this ?\nIdeally it would use a command (/usr/bin or sbin) or modify a plist (plistbuddy).\nI'd love to avoid using osascript (AppleScript)\n\n\nA: The region is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences, as the second part of the AppleLocale variable.  Some examples of the AppleLocale variable:\n\n\n*\n\n*en_US system language set to English, region set to US\n\n*ja_JP system language set to Japanese, region set to Japan\n\n*en_DE system language set to English, region set to Germany\nYou can get more info from Apple's Developer Library, which also has links to the ISO 639-2 codes that can be used.\n", "Q: If iOS's filesystem is case-sensitive then why can't I save a.pages and A.pages? When I try to save document in Pages.app on iOS with the same name but a different case I get: \n\"a\" is already taken. Please choose a different name.\n\nI would expect that this would work if iOS is case-sensitive.\n\nA: HFS+ is not case-sensitive.  It is, however, case-preserving.\nYour problem is not a problem, it is working as designed.\n\nA: Actually I found out recently, that even tho the iOS (iPhone/iPad) file system is case-sensitive, the iCloud storage IS NOT.\nSo if you could directly store to your iOS device, and not \"hit\" the iCloud storage you probably would be able to create the file(name).\n", "Q: How to toggle with grayscale in Yosemite? I prefer greyscale over inverting color when working in low light plus in general as its less strain on the eyes. But its too many clicks to toggle the settings.\nI am aware that to invert display color the shortcut is Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+8. And open Accessibility options with Cmd+Alt+F5, but there is no grayscale in the options.\nRight now, I open Accessibility via spotlight, then choose display & toggle the check box. I am wondering of there is any shortcut key for that? If not, is it possible to make a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: I have found an old Apple Discussion about this and the user who answered the question has posted an AppleScript file that will turn on and off grayscale. I have modified the original code so it would work with OS X Yosemite.\nOpen \"Script Editor\" and, in a new document, paste the following:\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to activate\ndelay 1\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\ntell process \"System Preferences\"\nclick the menu item \"Accessibility\" of the menu \"View\" of menu bar 1\ndelay 0.5\nclick the checkbox \"Use grayscale\" of window \"Accessibility\"\nend tell\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\nClick the hammer to compile it and then save but where it says \"File Format\" in the save dialog, choose \"Application\"\nBefore running this code make sure that \"Display\" in Accessibility has been selected like the image below. Once that has been done, you can quit System Preferences. \n\nOn the first run of the app, it will crash and OS X will ask if you want to allow the app to control the computer using accessibility features. Allow access, quit the app and relaunch it.\nSometimes this will not work and will crash with an error message. If this happens, just relaunch it and it will work fine. \nEDIT: This may help with making it a keyboard shortcut: Link\n\nA: The following example AppleScript code will toggle the state of the \"Use grayscale\" checkbox in Accessibility under System Preferences in OS X Yosemite (tested under 10.10.4) regardless of what was last selected under Accessibility as it tells System Preferences to open directly to the location of the \"Use grayscale\" checkbox and toggle its state.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell front window of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        with timeout of 5 seconds\n            repeat until (exists checkbox \"Use grayscale\")\n                delay 0.1\n            end repeat\n            click checkbox \"Use grayscale\"\n        end timeout\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nThe next issue is how you want to execute it.  The problem surrounding setting it as a Service through Automator to use a Keyboard shortcut without the use of a third party utility is every application that receives the shortcut key combo will need to have permission to do so and that becomes a pain unless you only choose e.g. Finder instead of all applications.  So without a third party utility I'd either save it as a script in the Users Script folder and then access it from the Script menu in the Apple menu bar or as an application.\nThe settings for the Script menu in the Apple menu bar are in the Script Editors Preferences.  Then it's just two mouse clicks anytime you want to toggle the state of the \"Use grayscale\" checkbox.  One to click the Scripts menu and another to click the script name.\nAs an application it can be placed in the Dock and then it's a single mouse click anytime you want to toggle the state of the \"Use grayscale\" checkbox.\nIn either of these two cases you'll have to give permission under Accessibility on the Privacy tab of Security & Privacy in System Preferences in order to run it successfully.\n\nAs a side note, if you use a program like FastScripts, you only need to use the example AppleScript code as a .scpt saved in Script Editor, not create an Automator service using the mentioned workaround in the comment and can assigned the keyboard shortcut in the Preferences for FastScripts.\nNote that I am not affiliated with the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user.\n\nA: I used the script from @CreeperzEdge answer and it had a bit of delay on my computer. I've slightly changed that script to:\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        click the checkbox \"Use grayscale\" of window \"Accessibility\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\nSomehow\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n\nis faster than\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\nend tell\n\nI would be curious about others' experience.\n\nA: I found that a 1-second delay was needed to get it to work for me.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        click the checkbox \"Use grayscale\" of window \"Accessibility\"\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\n\nA: I have built an app to make this process easier. It allows you to toggle the grayscale display from the status bar. It's a wrapper around the AppleScript mentioned in the answers written using PyObjC. I have tested it to work on macOS Mojave. \nYou can download it from here. The source code is here. \nNote: Due to Apple's restrictions, the app needs three kinds of permissions in order to work: a) allow opening an app from an unidentified developer b) allow access to System Events. c) accessibility permissions.  \n\nA: For anyone coming across this thread with a newer Mac, I altered the AppleScript to cope with the new UI of a tab:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    set the current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    delay 0.7 #needs time to open universal access\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\" to tell window \"Accessibility\"\n        select row 5 of table 1 of scroll area 1 #open display preferences\n        click radio button \"Color Filters\" of tab group 1 of group 1\n        click checkbox \"Enable Color Filters\" of tab group 1 of group 1\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n\nI also created an app that does this task with 1 click: Grayscale.

I have a brand new MacBook Pro Retnia, and I'd like to use it as a display for my Mac Pro (also brand new).  I followed the instructions on this page, and nothing happened when I pressed command F2.  Then I started scouring the forums.  I found several threads with the same problem, and I tried all the suggestions.  I checked my preferences to see if the keyboard assignments were messed up.  I tried restarting both computers in various orders.  I tried using internal and external keyboards on both computers.  I tried adding the fn key to the key command.  I spent a couple hours on this, but sadly, nothing worked.\nSo I'm really hoping that someone here has some idea what's going on.  This experience has really been disheartening.  I just bought these computers this year, and they failed at something so basic.  At this point, I would be satisfied just to see an error message telling me why cmd-F2 doesn't work.  I mean, if I try to eject a disk that has files that are currently in use, it will tell me why it can't eject right now.  But with this, I'm completely in the dark.

As usual with QuakeIII, the CD has to be in the drive. So mounting it seems to fix that.\nNext, I had done an install in the ~/Desktop/Quake3ISO directory, but a few years back had also done a wine install - which would not run.\nBut just now I copied all the files in the ~/Desktop/Quake3ISO/Quake3/baseq3 folder to the wine install folder in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/Quake\\ III\\ Arena/baseq3 folder, and now I can run Quake directly from that wine folder.\n   ie\n    cd \"/Users/robert/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Quake III Arena\"\n    wine quake3.exe\n\nand it runs fine.\nI can also so the same in the ~/Desktop/Quake3ISO/Quake3 folder\nie\ncd ~/Desktop/Quake3ISO/Quake3\nwine quake3.exe\n\n... and it runs fine.\nSo this tells me that I need to have AppleScript understand that the command to be executed should be executed in the directory it's changed to. So that when the program is looking for it's config files, it uses that directory as the base, or root directory and not the wine base directory?  I think?\n\nA: Every do shell script command starts a new shell, so the cd doesn't have any impact on the following command.

I installed a2ps on Mac OS X 10.10.4 via brew. My ~/.a2psrc contains Options: --medium=Letter -P pdf. But when I do a2ps foo.txt no PDF file is generated (this used to work on Ubuntu/Debian Linux). When I do a2ps -o foo.pdf foo.txt I get a PDF, but it cannot be opened (maybe it is corrupted?). However, on a2ps -o foo.pdf foo.txt I get a PS which I can then convert to PDF (and open). How can I make a2ps foo.txt to produce a valid PDF on Mac OS X? Note that I'm looking specifically for the command line a2ps, no GUI or other programs (obviously it's easy to generate a PDF from a text file with other tools)\n\nA: The a2ps utility is for formatting files for printing on a PostScript printer, hence its name is not a2pdf.\nThe file you created under Linux (or OS X), which is a miss-named .pdf file, is in fact a PostScript file and many Linux Distros will open it anyway.  Thus leading you to believe is was a PDF Document when in reality it's not.\nLooking at the file created under Linux in a Hex Editor its header starts off with, e.g., %!PS-Adobe-3.0 and a PDF Document starts with, e.g., %PDF-1.6%.\nThis is why you get the \"The file “filename.pdf” could not be opened. It may be damaged or use a file format that Preview doesn’t recognize.\" error message under OS X when trying to open a PostScript Document with a miss-named PDF Document extension.\nUpdate: Installing a2pdf\nAfter doing a little research I found a2pdf.  Further research required having Font::TTF::Font and PDF::API2 also installed.  So I downloaded all three packages master.zip (for a2pdf), Font-TTF-1.04.tar.gz and PDF-API2-2.023.tar.gz.\nNext I extracted all three and installed them in the same manner in the following order, Font::TTF::Font, PDF::API2 then the master.zip (for a2pdf).  I did this in a Terminal using the following commands.\n$ cd $target_directory\n$ perl Makefile.PL\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n\nI then tested, from my Home Directory, with: a2pdf filename.txt > filename.pdf\nIt create filename.pdf and I then opened it in Preview just fine as a PDF Document.\nThat said, there are other modules that can be installed to do things like syntax highlighting, e.g. Perl::Tidy.  So you'll need to do a bit more research to utilize the full capabilities of a2pdf.\nNote: I have Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode installed and as long as you have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed, which is a Homebrew prerequisite, you can install all of this from the Terminal the old fashioned way if not available from Homebrew, which I do not believe it is.\n\nA: This can be done as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save text file in UTF-8 encoding, even though `a2ps supports Latin1 only\n(This is done mainly because UTF-8 is standard nowadays.)\n\n*Convert text file to Latin1, using recode\n\n*Call a2ps on the result\n\n*Convert resulting PS file to PDF, using ps2pdf from LaTeX installation\n\n*Optionally, use gs to convert the resulting PDF to PDF-1.3 to reduce its file size\n\n*Copy the PDF-1.3 back to the directory the text file lives in\n\n\nIn Linux, this can be done by the following script.\nThe simplest way of calling it is txt2pdf file.txt, assuming it is saved under ~/bin/txt2pdf or some other standard location.

Okay, weird and sort of unnecessary question, but I'd love some help if you're able.\nIn Mountain Lion, you could swipe up with three fingers into Mission Control and then swipe back down to exit without lifting your fingers. Now in Yosemite (and I think Mavericks) you have to lift your fingers before you can do the exit gesture. Is there any way to fix this? I'd imagine there's some terminal code I can run to change this setting.\nBasically, I want to be able to enter into Mission Control, see what's open, and then leave again all in one continuous gesture like you could in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: There is an app called Better Touch Tool. You can download it at their homepage. \nFirst, you hide preview if there is any, and then select Trackpad on the top screen. Before you start adding gestures, make sure to allow it to control computer in System Preferences > Accessibility\n\nAs you can see, I already set up the swipe up and down gestures. Below, you can select which gesture will it be (in this case, 3 finger swipe up and down). And under Predefined Action, you can search Mission control.\n\nA: Well, this is a bit of a kludge, but if you make your gesture a little bit bigger, and swipe just above the boundary of the trackpad, with all three fingers, then you swipe back down, you get the effect that you want. Swiping past, in effect resets the state on the trackpad, without you feeling like you have lifted.\nMy guess is that the \"functionality\" that you describe was actually viewed as a bug by Apple. The track pad can be a bit fidgety as it is, so they probably added the reset so that when you swiped up, it would stay in the view you intended with that gesture. They also probably made the gestures a little more precise, so that you did keep ending up on the widgets screen accidentally. \nOkay, here is a second option, from us old folks who grew up in the days where Keyboard shortcuts were cool... <control>-<UpArrow> gives you the same function as the three fingered swipe. You can basically do what you want with two taps of the up key while holding the control key with a lot more control (sorry for the pun) than with the magic hand wavy move.\n", "Q: Opening Google/YouTube URLs in Chrome by default when Safari is default browser Safari is my default browser, and I like it that way.

Is there a system-level way to set the default browser for a sub-set of domains?\n\nA: As of macOS Sierra there is no way to do this without a a little proxy program which you set as the default browser.

Once you hook it up to a terminal (vt100, xterm, Terminal, etc...), man recognizes the terminal and sends the appropriate control codes to do color, bold, underline and the like. Its being parsed correctly - just for a null terminal type.\n\n comment by MichaelT\n\nA: Once upon a time, computers were routinely hooked up to teletypes (teleprinters) which would print all text on paper in real time as it was received.  Although teleprinters didn't have any facilities for underlined or bold-faced text, outputting an underline, backspacing, and printing something else would cause that something else to appear underlined.  Likewise outputting a character, backspacing, and outputting the same character would tend to make the character appear darker, though the effectiveness of that would vary depending upon the quality of the installed ribbon (if the ribbon was old and feeble, typing the same character twice would make it significantly darker; with a new ribbon typing the character even once would achieve close to maximum blackness).  Further, even if a user wasn't attached to a printer, redirecting the output of man to a print spooler would have been pretty common, which probably explains why man would behave that way even when the output was redirected.\nBTW, on some printers (and even teleprinters), the performance of _←U_←N_←D_←E_←R_←L_←I_←N_←I_←N_←G would be noticeably worse than ___________←←←←←←←←←←←UNDERLINING, since the former requires the printhead to repeatedly reverse direction (and typically overshoot its target at both ends).  The same would be true when using multi-strike boldface as well, but there the behavior could actually be advantageous since the first time each character is printed would immediately follow a backspace character and the second would not.  If the print head was accelerating while printing the first character, that would cause it to be misaligned slightly relative to the second, making the bold-face effect more effective.\n\nA: Or you can use ManOpen by Carl Lindberg to lookup and print any man page. ManOpen was first developed for NeXtStep and still works thanks to Carl.\n\nA: Mateusz's answer is correct, but it is worth pointing out that rather than stripping out formatting intended for a tty, you can have man format differently.\nFor example, you can get a nicely formatted pdf instead with: \nman -t ls | pstopdf -i -o ~/ls.pdf\n\n", "Q: how to see all files on external hard drive I have 200g of content on my 500g External Hard Drive but according to \"get info\" 471g of space is being used up, what am I not seeing?\n(To arrive at 200g I manually added all folder sizes using 'get info') Could it be hidden trash? \n\nA: Yes, it was simply that the trash was not emptied: I have learnt that to remove items from an External Hard Drive I must empty the trash while it is connected!

I would strongly encourage you to upgrade to 8GB of RAM and swap your drive out for an SSD. After upgrading the RAM to 6GB and making a roll-your-own Fusion drive (I installed an SSD in the Optical drive bay), Yosemite runs very well. Unless you need to use Snow Leopard for Rosetta (i.e. PowerPC compatibility), I'd go with Yosemite.\n\nA: To use Yosemite on ANY computer, you NEED to have an Solid State Hard Drive. This comes from painful experience on a mid-2009 and mid 2010 Macbook Pros. Yosemite is optimized for SSD, not spinning hard drives (this comes from a veteran Apple Genius who finally divulged this to me when the 2010 computer was glacially slow and unresponsive-in addition to freezing up constantly. DON'T use it with the stock hard drive! F%*#ing Apple won't tell you this like it won't tell you that updated Pages sucks big time. And Mail is a horror show. Just sayin'. I think Apple has lost its beautiful way with software en route to earning billions with the iPhone and iPad, etc..\n", "Q: iBooks Author Latex Question Any idea how would you go about drawing a 3x3 matrix in iBooks Author?\nMy Latex formula which works on other platforms is\n$$\\left[\\begin{array}{ c c c }1 & 1 & 1 \\2 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & -1\\end{array} \\right]$$\niBooks simply says \"invalid equation\".\nCheers\nNick\n\nA: iBooks Author only supports a subset of LaTeX, see iBooks Author: About LaTeX and MathML support for a full list of supported commands.\nFrom looking at the samples in the support document, something like \n\\begin{matrix}\n1 &  1 &  1 \\\\\n2 & -1 &  1 \\\\\n1 &  2 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\nshould work.\n", "Q: Does Apple Music store original ripped music in cloud? I had a long talk with a guy from apple costumer help because of the notorious recent problems with Itunes/Apple Music. By the way he told me that if I have a big collection of music on my mac containing amongst other thing ripped music in a better quality then the usual 256 of Apple this would now, as part of Apple Music be stored in the cloud in its original (better!) quality. So when I have a second Mac with the same Apple ID I wouldn't need to copy anything from Itunes to this second Mac. To simply start a new Itunes folder on the second Mac would synchronize EVERYTHING. So after the necessary time my itunes on the second Mac would look exactly like the Itunes on my first. Is that really so? I couldn't find anything about that on Apple's description of Apple Music (and by the way, I don't have Itunes Match, but that's probably besides the point).\n\nA: Actually, according to this Apple Music support page, lossless formats will NOT be preserved in the cloud:\n\"Songs encoded in ALAC, WAV, or AIFF formats will be transcoded to a separate temporary AAC 256 Kbps file locally, before they're uploaded to iCloud.\"\nMeanwhile, the Apple Music product description states that they \"compare every track in your collection to the Apple Music library to see if we have a copy. If we do, you can automatically listen to it straight from the cloud,\" which suggests that higher quality files do not, in fact, replace Apple's default in-cloud counterparts.\nSorry to dash your dreams. Maybe you could disguise the metadata on each of your files with slightly-off album names to prevent Apple from recognizing them, then use a higher quality file other than the formats mentioned above, which would be converted to AAC. Alternatively, Google Play's default bitrate is 320 kbps, and its uploading service is currently free.\n\nA: This article seems to agree with what you have been told How to check the status of your songs\nThe key point states:\n\nYou use iTunes Match or Apple Music, or both. This status means that Apple has scanned and uploaded the track to its servers; when you re-download it, it'll show up in its original format—128kbps mp3, 256kbps AAC, however you uploaded it. As long as you've downloaded this track to your library before ending your Match or Music subscriptions, it's yours forever.\n\n", "Q: Restore Photos/Videos Back to iPhone Camera Roll If you connect the iPhone to Windows, it comes up in the Computer as a digital camera and lets you Copy/Move photos/videos easily from there, you don’t need to use Photos on the Mac.\nIf, after connecting like above, you move (not copy) all the photos and videos to a folder on the PC, they will obviously disappear from the Camera Roll in iPhone.\nIs it possible to restore the photos and videos back to the Camera Roll?\nI have accidentally moved (instead of copying) lots of photos and videos from my iPhone to a folder Windows 7. It slipped my mind that there were a few slow-mo videos which will not play without iPhone/iMovie.\nAlso, when photos are viewed on iPhone, it displays the location name in the title, which I cannot have once I have moved photos to the computer. In the JPG metadata I only see the Latitude and Longitude saved there.\nThus I prefer to undo this mistake and take photos/videos back to iPhone, is there a way?\n\nA: I finally resolved this by using iTunes Sync to add photos to an album in iPhone. It is only slightly different as my photos went back to a separate album, not Camera Roll but that’s okay. I noticed that the location name was restored and since it syncs Videos too, I’m sure slow-mo videos would work the way they should.\nAlso, latest Quicktime player on Mac plays slow-mo videos just like the iPhone.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with Windows but it seems that this may work. If you have the iCloud Control Panel installed you should navigate to your Pictures folder and open the Photo Stream folder. In here you can paste your photos into the Uploads folder and they will automatically sync to your iPhone. Videos cannot be synced through this method, however they can be added using the Photos tab in iTunes.\nSource\n", "Q: Don't charge iphone when plugged into macbook? Is it possible to temporarily keep your iPhone from draining the macbook battery? When I'm out and about I sometimes want to connect my [nearly empty] macbook to my [not so empty] iphone so I can tether without using WiFi (saving battery), but then my poor macbook starts charging my iPhone and is drained even faster.\n\nA: Not possible, you would have to physically alter the USB cord and remove the pins related to power and leave the data ones intact.\n\nA: That's not possible. Also, modifying a USB cable (as suggested in another answer) is a) probably not a good idea and b) probably won't even work (see this question & answer).\nEnergy-wise, you are most likely better of by just using wifi for tethering.\n", "Q: Yosemite /etc/resolver/env.domain.com not working We have a site to site VPN connection setup in the office to two development networks\n\n\n*\n\n*dev\n\n*stage\n\n\nI want to be able to let people in the office not be on VPN for dns resolution to work.

It dropped like two or three feet. The noise is like a rattling of a beanbag, but I don't know the source.\n\nA: At the risk of sounding obvious, something inside broke. If you are the handy type and have the tools you could open it up following the directions for your model on iFixit.com or take it to an Apple store (or other Apple dealer who does repairs) and see what they say.\nAlso do not power on a laptop with something rattling around in it after you dropped it. It could make the problem worse.\n\nA: I've looked at a few of the guides at iFixit.com for the MacBook Air:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Air\nAssuming your handy with tools and the MacBook isn't under warranty, you should be able to open it up see what's going on. Otherwise, take it to the nearest apple authorized repair facility. \nYou'll need a pentalobe (5 point) screwdriver to remove the bottom. Hopefully the broken bit is just a plastic tab or something that you can remove and live without. You might be able to take the bottom off and gently shake loose the broken bit causing the noise. \nIf that's all it is, then you should be able reassemble it and it should run normally.

Is there a way to do that?\n(In iOS, this speaker works great with AirPlay)\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible.  The reason you can Airplay with your phone and not your Mac, is due to the fact that the Jawbone Mini app appears to convert the Bluetooth speaker to an Airplay device as shown here. \nhttps://jawbone.com/kb/articles/JawboneappiOS.html and here http://appadvice.com/appnn/2013/12/review-jawbones-big-jambox-could-be-the-best-portable-speaker-out-there (the second link is for the Jawbone Big Jambox, but the app is the same). \nHowever, you should be able to pair the speaker with Bluetooth and still use it. If you want it to show up in the Airplay speaker menu, you need to build a DIY solution with a Raspberry Pi or purchase an Airplay Compatible Speaker as zero said above. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: Bluetooth and AirPlay are completely different technologies. You can't send audio over wifi (AirPlay) to a device with only BlueTooth reception. If you want to AirPlay to this particular speaker, you'd need to physically hook it up to an iOS or OSX device or an AirPort Express or create your own AirPort receiver with something like a Raspberry Pi that you then attach to the speaker. \n", "Q: Automatic shutdown hindered by sleep mode I have an iMac (late 2009 model) running Yosemite. Recently, I have set up automatic shutdown in the Energy Saver settings under System Preferences. However, if my computer goes into sleep mode before the automatic shutdown - which I have scheduled to happen after twenty minutes of inactivity - my computer will not shutdown automatically at the scheduled time. \nThe question: is there a way to make my iMac shutdown at the scheduled time even when it is in sleep mode, or is there no way to circumvent this and I'm better off with manual shutdowns or disabling sleep mode?\n\nA: You can use a third party tool like Power Manager to automate reliable shut downs.\n\nBy default, events will wake a sleeping Mac before being performed. Typically your Mac will be woken 15 – 30 seconds before the scheduled shut down begins. Ultimately, the wake up is performed by OS X's IOPMQueue which you can see and edit through the pmset tool.\nI am the engineer behind Power Manager, so do ask if you need more details.\n\nA: You could set a start up / wake right before the shutdown time. There should be enough time before sleep kicks back in to have the normal shutdown be processed.\nI'd say 5 minutes of gap on a 15 minute sleep timer would be ideal.\n\nA: Same problem, so far the only solution I've found is to buy a shutdown timer off the App Store.\n\nA: The Mac will be prevented from auto shutdown if goes to sleep first. It must be fully awake.\nSolution: Set the auto wake schedule 5 mins before the auto shutdown.\n\nTo shut down automatically, your Mac must be awake at the time that it's scheduled to shut down, and remain awake for at least 10 minutes past that time. If it's sleeping at the scheduled shutdown time, it continues sleeping instead of shutting down. If it's set to go to sleep after less than 15 minutes of inactivity, it might go back to sleep before it can shut down. To make sure that your Mac shuts down even when sleeping, set it to start up or wake 5 minutes before the scheduled shutdown time.\n\nReference: Set a startup, wake, sleep, restart, or shutdown time on your Mac (Official Apple Support)\n", "Q: Does Apple's Out-of-Warranty Replacement cover iPhones regardless of condition? I have a water-damaged iPhone 6. I took it to a non-Apple repair shop after the plunge (the Apple Store was too far away for urgent service), but it still does not work. It powers on, but the screen is always black or only backlit. Overall, the phone is in very good condition cosmetically.\nOn to the question. The repair shop removed some heat shields from the logic board during the cleaning process. Can I still bring my iPhone to the Apple Store for an out-of-warranty replacement? The service is currently listed on their website for $299, but are there special conditions I should be aware of before making the trip? Will a technician open the phone for inspection before offering a replacement?\n\nA: No, it does not. Out-of-warranty service is provided for phones which have not suffered what is defined as \"catastrophic damage\" and additional fees on top of the OOW service fee may be charged up to the replacement value of the product. \nPlease review Section 3 of the ERS/OOW Terms page: Source\nNote that in this response, I am not qualifying your repair as either OOW or beyond that and needing to pay replacement fees. That is just a potential outcome, and is meant to highlight that not all OOW damage is covered.\n", "Q: command + delete in terminal Often, when I'm typing in a super long command(usually ruby on rails console code), I decide that I need to do something else first and therefore, have to delete the command which I just typed(but not executed) on the terminal. Is there a shortcut to do this? command+delete and option+delete do not work. The down arrow works sporadically. \nIf it helps, I'm on The El Capitan Developer Preview 3 but I've noticed this behaviour on Yosemite as well.\n\nA: If you are using emacs keybindings (default for bash, zsh, pry (ruby interpreter), python and many more), ^u (control + u) might be what you want - it erases everything prior to your cursor. If you want to stop writing the command and forget what you did, use ^c (control + c), which is, by the way, a SIGKILL(9) signal (see man signal).\nBy the way, the keybindings not only work on OS X 10.11, but also on all Unix-like systems I've ever seen.\n\nA: In addition to the other emacs shortcuts posted by theoden, you can also use ^a (control + a) to return to the beginning of the line to edit it, and ^k (control + k) to cut the line. \nHope that helps.\n\nA: Usually I want to keep the command I've been typing and just not run it. In that case, under Bash, at least, hitting esc-# will add a hash character to the beginning of the line and then (essentially) hit enter, shoving the command into your history. You can then run whatever commands you want, and use your shell history keys to bring back the previous command. Delete the hash at the beginning of the line, go to the end, and finish it up.\n", "Q: How does Beamer work? I have just bought the Beamer app in order to stream videos from my MacBook to my Apple TV, it works great and I am very happy. Previously I was using the AirPlay feature provided by Apple but it often seemed to reduce the video quality and lag. My question is, how the Beamer app works, considering that the Apple TV is quite closed environment, which does not allow third party apps for now? Additionally, if the app relies on the same technology as the AirPlay why the video quality seems better? \n\nA: I've used the app for a while. Much of the limitations in Airplay are from the codec limitations of playing video on air play.\nBeamer bundles ffmpeg usually here:\n/Applications/Beamer.app/Contents/Resources/ffmpeg\n\nOn modern systems, this is fast enough to transcode the video to the proper format that Apple TV can play.\nI played a video and the command it ran is as follows:\n\n/Applications/Beamer.app/Contents/Resources/ffmpeg -hide_banner -nostdin -nostats -loglevel warning --segment-length 5 --segment-offset 0 -i file:/Users/risner/Documents/test.mp4 -f mpegts --segment-iframe-only 0 -c:v copy -vbsf h264_mp4toannexb -map 0:0 -c:a libmp3lame -ac 2 -aq 4 -matrix_encoding dplii -ar 48000 -async 1 -map 0:1 pipe:1\n\nThis produces a stream that the Apple TV consumes.\n", "Q: What causes 5 pink bars on 27\" iMac (2011)? I've got a 27 inch iMac made in 2011 that displays 5 pink vertical bars on the screen. It won't boot properly. I ran the Apple Hardware Test and it came up clean. \nMachine Specs:\nApple Subfamily:    Mid-2011 \nApple Model No: A1312 (EMC 2429)\nModel ID:   iMac12,2\n\n\nA: I have had this problem.  It coincided with the iMac running very hot. It crashed and the pink stripes appeared. Every time I tried to start it, it stopped loading and rebooted. I thought it might be the video chip (I'm no Mac expert).  I gave up and left it for months then tried again, rebooting holding down the shift key and various other combinations of keys that I'd read about. This went on for hours but somehow the pink bars disappeared eventually, returned then went again. Eventually and to me, miraculously, the Mac started! I read somewhere that out of date software can make the Mac run too hot so I checked via the disk utility and found disused printer and scanner drivers using a lot of power so uninstalled them. Eventually after another crash or two and the stripes reappearing, I found that turning on holding down the shift key until the screen cleared, shutting down and starting again the OS loaded. It started running cooler and after shutting down correctly and restarting a few times all seems well (so far!). It has been like monkeys typing Shakespeare but I'm glad I didn't take the advice of a computer repairer I'd phoned who told me I should scrap the iMac (a near top of range 2011 model costing me £1600), take out the hard drive and put it in another Mac!  I hope this garbled account might give a little hope!\n\nA: This is most likely a bad graphics card, which is built in to the logic board on most iMac models. It also could be a bad display, though that's much likely. And it could also be a bad display cable, though that is the least likely solution. \n\nA: Its typical for a crashed Graphics Card. I had the exact same problem.\nHere is how I solved it:\nConnected the iMac with another Computer. Started the other machine in the Target Mode and backuped all data from my iMac.\nFor that I needed a wired keyboard!\nThat would be the workaround\nThen you'd would have to get the hardware repaired, if this seems worth the price for such an old machine.\nnBot\n\nA: The correct would be to seek assistance in your country and city, this defect is the video card.Apple had released to a Recall to return for no cost video card.\n\nA: Have you tried holding down the [escape] key during startup?

I was listening to music on the way home today, and all of a sudden it wouldn't play the next track.  On closer inspection it was skipping through every track, regardless of whether I had pressed play or not.  The majority (I would say about 90-95%) of my music is streamed from iTunes Match, but the very few downloaded songs on my phone were also doing the same thing.  I tried to download a few more of the songs, but it wouldn't allow me to.  It looks like it tries to connect to do so, but cancels itself.\nSo far I have tried the following without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closed and re-opened the app;\n\n*Restarted the phone;\n\n*Hard reset the phone;\n\n*Signed in and out of iTunes Match on the phone;\n\n*Connected the phone to my Mac and tried to run a sync or two with iTunes;\n\n*Erased all settings;\n\n*Restored from an iTunes Backup;\n\n\nIt is still skipping through every track and wont let me download.  This is very annoying, seeing as I pay for things to \"just work\" but more often than not I'm having to spend my nights doing admin for the stuff that should just work.\nWhat else can I try other than take it into a store, which I do not want to do as I really don't have the time to deal with Apple's clueless Geniuses.\nThanks in advance.\nUPDATE : I had already checked the Server Status at Apple's website, but I neglected to add that to my question\n\nA: It was reported earlier today on multiple sources that Apple services were experiencing outages throughout the day.

Reading through various threads a common theme kept coming up. Log out/in from iTunes. I went into Settings on my iPhone 6+ then clicked on my Apple ID at the top. Then I clicked Sign Out. Then I logged back in. When I went back to the Music app, I shuffled my songs and they all played which is a mix of iTunes Match music and Purchased music. (I don't subscribe to Apple Music.

There are two sets of applications where I'm running into this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*iWork, where I only have the new stuff installed because Software Update harasses you to install the new stuff if it detects you only have the old stuff\n\n*Office 2016, which I've discovered fixes everything I liked about Office 2011\n\n\nWhen iWork first came out I tried telling the system to open all .numbers, .pages, and .keynote files with the '09 versions of the applications by default, but it ended up ignoring that preference and launched the new versions anyway.  As such I've gotten accustomed to just going to the Applications folder, opening up the old version manually, and then dropping whatever I want to edit into the open app.\nOffice is a bit more integral to what I do, however, and I'm really not looking forward to having to do more of this.  Is there some sort of setting, terminal command, script, etc. that I can set to force the use of an older version by default?\n\nA: If you want to open specific file types with a certain default application, e.g., .docx or .pages:\n1) right-click on any of those files, hold down the option key and click on \"Show Inspector\". \n2) Choose your default application, e.g., Office 2011 Word, from the \"open with\" menu\n\n3) Click on the \"change all\" button just below the \"open with\" tab\n\nA: To open a file with the non-default application from a terminal, you can use open -a path/to/application file. \nFrom the man page:\n\nThe open command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had\n       double-clicked the file's icon.

I already have ios 5.1.1 and I need 6.0.1 can u help me?\n\nA: You cannot update your iPod.\nObsolete models have a maximum iOS version that is supported by Apple, and your iPod's max version is 5.1.1. I'm guessing you have a 3rd generation iPod. As iOS evolved, devices didn't, so either the device would need to run slower or the device would have to be dropped.\nA more technical reason:\nLet's look at the specs of the 3rd generation iPod compared to the iPhone 3GS (which stopped support at iOS 6.1.3)...\niPhone 3GS specs:(source)\n\nCPU: 600 MHz Cortex A8\nGPU: PowerVR SGX535\nRAM: 256 MB\nCamera: 3.1 MP stills, VGA video recording @ 30 fps\n\niPod 3rd generation specs:(source)\n\nCPU: 600 MHz Cortex A8\nGPU: PowerVR SGX535\nRAM: 256 MB\nCamera: none\n\nDid you notice that there is the same amount of power in the bodies of both of the devices, but the only difference was, the iPod had no camera? At that time, they were perfecting the camera on the lock screen.\nIn iOS 5, the arrow would actually be just a bit shorter, to accommodate for the camera shortcut. In iOS 5.1, this was replaced by the pull-up window that still only appeared on a double-tap of the home button.\nIn iOS 6, the pull-up for the camera window was always there. This meant another complete redesign of the lock screen's slider, and Apple didn't want to make an alternative UI for the iPod 3rd generation. Those that had the iPhone 3GS, they enjoyed several lag issues and battery drain issues, even though it really introduced nothing new into the OS.\nA more realistic reason:\nApple wants people to buy their products so they can continue to generate profit. If iPhones lasted forever, the profits wouldn't be flowing in. Why do you think carriers offer upgrades?\nIn my experience, Apple deliberately slows performance of devices as they get older, and then people have to run out and spend close to $200 on an upgraded model of the same device.\nWhy else do you think people want the brand new iPhone? :)\n\nA: It sounds like your iPod might be too old to have the newest update, which is why it says it is up to date. As Sebastian said, have you tried to update it via iTunes?\n", "Q: iPhone 5c Digitizer or logic board damage My wife dropped her phone on Sunday... I don't want to replace the screen if it's the logic board and nothing can be done to recover her data. A beautiful picture:\n\nIf this were the 1970's her phone would be so vogue... Who didn't love plaid back then?\nAnyway... I have taken the screen off and checked the connections, put everything back together. No change.\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone still rings when called\n\n*The phone vibrates when switched into silent mode\n\n*The digitizer is not working - the phone cannot be \"unlocked\" and calls cannot be answered\n\n*There was a screw that had detached from the retaining plate where the screen connects to the logic board\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n*I tried hard reboots (power + home)\n\n\n*\n\n*The home and power buttons are still recognized but this has no impact on the artifacting display\n\n*During the hard reboot the display goes blank and then lights up again after being restarted.\n\n\n*I tried disconnecting / reconnecting the battery from the logic board\n\n\n*\n\n*This had no impact on the display. We've gone plaid.\n\n\n\nCurious if anyone can tell whether this symptom is indicative of a bad logic board or if the display / digitizer cables have been damaged!\n\nA: If your phone rings when called, that tells you a couple things that the phone is able to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone is able to turn on.\n\n*The phone is able to process the received call (and I'm guessing all of iOS's pretty effects with loading it as well).\n\n*The phone is able to process events from all of the phone's physical buttons (the Lock button, Volume Up/Down, and the Home button).\n\n\nHowever, as it seems, the phone isn't able to send touch events to the UI, meaning the digitizer is broken.\nScrew in the loose screw, replace the screen/digitizer unit, and reboot. All will be well. :)\n", "Q: How to tell which websites take your MAC address of your iPhone/iPad when visiting? how can you tell when viewing webpages, which ones are taking down your device info like MAC address, when you use an iphone or ipad?\nOr how to prevent that information being taken?\n\nA: It isn't possible for a website to get the MAC address from an iPhone or iPad.\nFor that to work, Apple would have to expose that information through JavaScript. They haven't done that. Don't take my word for it though, try a web search for something like \"javascript get ios mac address\" and you'll find lots of people asking how to do it and lots of people replying that it isn't possible (except in Internet Explorer on Windows in some very specific conditions).\nYears ago you could get the MAC address of an iPad or iPhone if you wrote an actual iOS application. However Apple changed that in 2013 with iOS 7 as detailed here.\n\nA: Websites in general can't get your MAC address:\n\nThe MAC address, by TCP/IP standards, is never communicated outside of the local-area network to which it pertains\n\nSome websites could theoretically obtain that kind of information via ActiveX, or a Java applet, but neither is available on stock iOS Safari.\nIf anonymity is your concern, there are multiple ways to uniquely identify a website visitor that don't need a MAC address. WSJ has a nice collection of articles, and many others too.\n\nA: As other answers said...\nWebsites may NOT take your MAC address.\nIf Privacy is your concern, find a VPN app on the App Store that guarantees your privacy. This may make your connection slower. In addition, if you find a bad VPN app, then the server might actually be recording your data.\n", "Q: I can't download YouTube app from icloud I deleted the YouTube app about 3 or 4 months ago and I decided to download it again.\nI went to the App Store and I looked for it and when I saw it the iCloud icon was not there, so I clicked on the app in the App Store. The iCloud icon is dull and when I click on it nothing happens!!! I tried uploading YouTube from Safari onto the home screen but still it just takes me to the website not the app.\nI have a YouTube account and everything and I still get emails from YouTube but I can't download the app!!\n\nA: It's because the app is 17+. Go to your restrictions settings and enable apps above this age limit. Then try it again\n\nA: Use the App Store app to download YouTube onto your phone. If the iCloud icon is greyed out and nothing's working, try...\n\n*\n\n*Switching your phone on Airplane mode and back off.\nTo do this, swipe up from the bottom of your screen and tap the icon for an airplane. Doing this will turn the cellular radio and the Wi-Fi connector off and back on again.\nOn iOS 6 and earlier, where Control Center is not available (nothing happens if you swipe up from the bottom of the screen), do this from Settings. It's the first toggle switch.\n\n*\n\n*Turning your phone off and back on again.\nTo turn your phone off, hold the button on the top of your phone (or the one on the right-hand side if you have an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus) until a slider comes down. Slide the slider that appears to turn it off.\nTo turn it back on again, press and hold the button again, or plug the phone in if your lock button isn't working.\nAfter you do either of these options, go into the App Store and try downloading it again.\nYou should see the app downloading right onto your home screen.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open iOS App Store App\n\n*Press Updates for iPhone or Purchased for iPad in bottom menu bar.\n\n*Press Purchased at the top of the screen (only for iPhone)\n\n*Press My Purchases (only for iPhone)\n\n*Press Not on This iPhone or Not on This iPad\n\n*Find the App.\n\n\nIf that isn't working and you have updated your apps using iTunes\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your device into your computer\n\n*Click the device icon on the top left side of iTunes\n\n*Under Settings click Apps\n\n*There will be a list of Apps, scroll down to find YouTube\n\n*Click the Install Button\n\n*Click the Apply Button\n\n\nIf you don't see the app on iTunes, you may have to go to the iTunes App Store to download it. If the App says that it is downloaded, then click on Purchased on the right, click on Not in My Library and find it there, and then download it. Now go back up to the instructions for iTunes and you should at this point be able to get it back.\nOne other thought crossed my mind. If you happened to have set, accidentally set Parental Control Settings for less than 17+, then you won't be able to download youtube. You will need to turn Parental Control Preferences off or set them to unlimited in order to get the app.\n\nA: It's more than likely the age restrictions in general settings just lift the age restriction in restrictions ok. Karlos\n\nA: *\n\n*The reasons could be either Restrictions check to make sure that you don't have a restriction to install an app that's rated for 17+ or Compatibility you'll only be able to install it on an operating system that's at least iOS version 8.0 or higher.\n\n*If the above is true then you might wanna try to sign out of the App Store and then sign back in.\n\n*If the latter is also true then I'd suggest you to perform a Force Restart on your device which usually works when the others don't.\n\n", "Q: Classic ipod 120gb hardrive crash When I turn my ipod on I get the red circle with an X in it that tells me to contact apple support. I accessed the diagnostics and when I try to run either of the hard drive test the display says (can't open device) ERROR! Diag halt. I'm pretty sure my hard drive is toast and I know how to replace the hard drive but,how do I download software? when I connect it to Itunes on my computer will the software download while it synchronizes? or do I have to download software from apple? \n\nA: If you can replace the hard drive from your iPod classic with another hard drive from another iPod classic 120GB, then you should be fine. The OS will automatically be on there. If not, it'll download automatically through iTunes. The same case happens if the replacement hard drive has an older version of the firmware.\n", "Q: Late 2006 iMac Issue: Logic Board or Hard Drive? I have a question. I have a late 2006 17\" White iMac, and it is having issues. I don't know if it has a bad hard drive (again..), or if it has a bad logic board, and I have no idea how to check it. I have taken this thing in many, many times for this same issue, but Apple just tells me it is a bad hard drive and just replaces it. Yet this issue continues to happen, and happen, and happen. I've been through 3 hard drives within the last three years or so.\nHeres the symptoms: \n~Won't stay on longer than 10 minutes without getting the beach ball/pinwheel of death (as I have begun to call it)\n~Or, it will freeze completely (if music is playing, the last note it was on will just endlessly repeat. \n~Screen will randomly go black with no way of getting it back. Only sign of life is a slight glow. \n~Hates more than one application open at a time, and especially hates Firefox/Safari/really any Internet browser... \n~Has bars and speckles of randomly coloured pixels in the display. \n~Sometimes will not finish booting sequence. \nWhat I have tried: \n~ I tried installing a light version Ubuntu, as I had no money for the newer versions of OS X. The problems only became worse. (As in, the keyboard/mouse no longer worked, everything was crashing, nothing would stay open, etc.)\n~Following a million different tutorials that are supposed to \"fix\" the problem, to no avail.. \n~I replaced the hard drive. This didn't work, and now I don't even have any sort of picture (I do have the slight glow like I mentioned earlier) when attempting to boot from a disc. I have made sure three times now that I replugged in everything that I unplugged, and everything is where it should be. \nIs there any chance left for this poor Mac, or should I get my hard drive back and be rid of it? It is not under warranty, nor do I have any money to be able to buy a new logic board, and/or any idea on how to replace my existing one. I am not paying $700 to Apple for them to fix it either, as that is outside of my budget.\nAny/all help with this is highly appreciated, and Thanks! (:\n\nA: If the hard drive replacement method has continued to fail, I'd guess that either: A) The hard drive is not actually broken, or B) The computer somehow makes the hard drive go bad. I've taken that model of iMac apart before, and the inside is fairly cramped for space. That leads me to think that your processor may overheat and \"hang\", causing it to go black, or stop doing whatever process it's on and spin the \"beach ball\". If you really want to keep using your 9 year old machine, I'd suggest taking it to a repair shop that can repair Macs. They may find that it has a faulty processor or cooling system for the processor, or something else. I'm not sure how much that would cost, but in my opinion, it may be time to upgrade. Since you don't want to spend the price of a new Mac, you could look into purchasing a used computer. It's hard to transition to a Windows or Linux machine for some people, so if you've gotten used to Mac OSX, stick with it. I've seen advertisements for aluminum iMacs from 2008 or so for as little as $400 at local computer stores. If you're comfortable with Craigslist, you could look for one there, and it may be cheaper. However Craigslist doesn't have warranties. Read a little about purchasing a used computer before you do so.\n", "Q: Weird arrow icon next to Apple logo I am seeing this weird arrow icon next to Apple icon in OSX Mavericks. No idea what it is. The z-index is higher than the mouse pointer. (If I hover mouse pointer there, it goes behind the arrow).\nI tried to take it's screenshot but it was not there. I took a picture using my phone.\nAnyone has any idea?\n\n\nA: It looks like one of the arrow cursors for when you hover over certain parts of the screen (resizing?). Sometimes the cursor gets stuck on certain parts of the screen. Even though I can still move my mouse, a copy of the cursor gets stuck somewhere.\n\n", "Q: Permanently saving changes to $PATH I have ruby and homebrew running for a while and I'm starting to play with Bash. I have encountered a problem with my PATH variable as echo'd:\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin??n’export\n\nAs you can see, there is both redundancy and junk at the end int he form of illegal characters (causing a host of other issues).\nI can change the PATH with \nexport PATH=\"/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin\"\n\nwhich does indeed return the desired PATH when echo'd:\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin\n\nBut I can't figure out for the life of me how to save the PATH so that it doesn't reset on reopening. I don't need to add paths. I just want to make this the new value of that variable. Please, how can I make this change permanent?\n\nA: You can simply add your export PATH... line in your bash_profile file. This file is run every time you start terminal and will modify your PATH variable as you want. You can open/edit this from anywhere in terminal using\n open ~/.bash_profile\n\nYou probably also want to check that there are no conflicting export PATH... statements that overwrite each other or something.\n", "Q: How can I download the entirety of my Google Drive to my iPhone? iPhone 5c with the latest iOS and Google Drive app. I see that I can set individual photos to be available offline. This functionality is not available for folders though. Is there a third party app that allows this?\n\nA: Based on a few Google Searches, there is no in-app or third party app on the App store which allows you to do this. There is only one on Android. I suggest filling out a request on the Google Product Forms to see if the feature will be available in the near future. \n", "Q: Videos failing to download to iPad from Canon Camera I am using a Canon Vivia HF R500 to take videos and downloading them to my iPad Air 2 via a USB to Lightening connection. This has been working flawlessly for me for months. I open Photos, connect the camera, and an import icon shows up. I select the videos I want, and click import. Then the videos show up in Albums > Videos.\nToday it stopped working. The iPad sees the camera, shows the import icon, lets me select the videos, and seems to import them, but they never show up on the iPad.

What can I do?\nI've installed iFunBox to try and locate them (or the problem) via the iPad file system, but am not familiar enough with it to make changes.\nPlease help.\n\nA: I upgraded the iPad to IOS 9 Public Beta and did not turn iCloud on and the issue was solved.  This is not an ideal solution and I'm lucky that the Beta was available.\nI tried reinstalling IOS 8.4 multiple times and the problem persisted. I tried both restoring the iPad from the cloud and starting fresh after an IOS 8.4 install.  Both of these failed.  I did not try a fresh install where I turned iCloud off from the start, however. I didn't think of this until I installed IOS 9 Beta.\nI tried installing IOS 8.3, but could not get it to revert. I think Apple works hard to prevent this.\nMy conclusion is that there is a bug in IOS 8.4 that is causing this problem. If I had to guess, it has something to do with iCloud trying to sync huge videos from an external HD Camera. So perhaps it's an iCloud issue, but it's hard to separate the OS from the Cloud at this point. Hopefully the issue is solved with the IOS 9 Beta and continues to be solved when IOS 9 is released later this year.\n", "Q: Change app name without uploading new binary?

Once in a while, I need to check some CDs or DVDs - mostly I take backup of photos shoot with camera and phone on CDs, so also planning to buy portable DVD and CD writer, which can work with MacBook Air.\nApple has both hardware available\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Wireless Keyboard - link\n\n*Apple USB SuperDrive - link\nAs you must be knowing, MacBook Air only has 1 USB port on each side, and lot of external DVD and CD writes comes with 2-usb cable. I am not taking about wireless CD/DVD writer, only USB writer.\nI need your suggestion for both - keyboard and writer. \nShould I go ahead and buy Apple ones, or are there better h/w available in market which is compatible with MacBook Air?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have been using the Apple Bluetooth keyboard for ~ 5 years, and I am pretty happy with it. It is pretty sturdy and even after such long time and ~8 hrs daily usage, I wouldn't notice any significant sign of wear. One advantage is that it is the same keyboard layout as on the MacBooks, which may be more convenient when switching back and forth between the external and in-built keyboard. A disadvantage is that it doesn't have background illumination, but it only really matters if you work in a rather dark environment. \nI also saw a logitech keyboard at a Best Buy once which looked almost exactly like the Apple Bluetooth keyboard, except that it was plastic, not aluminum; the price was about the same, and it also almost felt like the same; however, I can't say anything about its long-term durability. \nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention that I spilled water over it a couple of times, and one time it was half a glass of coke. I turned it off, took out the batteries, and put it under running water in my sink for about 10 minutes (I was afraid that it'd be sticky if it would still work at all afterwards). Next, I let it dry for about 1 1/2 weeks and used a spare mechanical keyboard instead (which I really love too). However, the Apple Bluetooth keyboard turned out to be fine eventually.\nSorry, I can't really comment on the CD/DVD drive: I haven't used any for a decade or so. \n", "Q: Guest Account as Thief Trap in case of losing MacBook One week ago my MBPro has been stolen, and unfortunately no \"Where's My Mac\" like's helped.\nMy idea for securing my next MacBook is to create Password-free/guest-like account in case of another bad luck.\nWhen thief will open the lid, he will log in, and maybe some installed software will take picture from front camera? Maybe some keylogger will help? Maybe some sneaky Prey-like software in background?\nWhat do You think?\nHow to find my Mac even if my someone will reinstall the OSX?\n\nA: There is some literature out there for you (e.g.here or here). Basically there is different means of protection. \n\n\n*\n\n*Locating the device (Find my Mac)\n\n*Surveillance apps (also have a look at the OS X Back to my mac, which reportedly freed some Macs from their thieves)\n\n*Data security / encryption (e.g. Filevault2 encryption, Firmware password)\n\n*Physical protection (e.g. Kensington lock)\n\n\nWatch out when using Filevault2 for Full Disk Encryption. This will make your data safe but will maybe not lure the thief into reveling his / her location, since only a limited version of OS X is booted.\nSetting a firmware password will prevent others to boot different disks.\nBut watch out. These features (filevault and firmware password) require more care with backups, etc. The risk that you lock yourself out is significantly higher.\n\nA: I suggest you take a look at using Fire-vault 2 on your next Mac. This will keep your data safe. In addition, set a firmware password by following instructions here: http://www.imore.com/how-set-your-macs-firmware-password-and-why-you-shouldnt. This will prevent anyone from booting the Macbook without a password as mentioned below by n1000.\nIf you want to go the stealth route, you can create a password free account with and place a Remote Keylogger(Don't install freeware like Keytext, you need to have access to the Mac to retrieve the log files). Do a quick Google search and read reviews for a key logger that you can access remotely. You may have to pay for that software. When you have the key logger set up install something like http://excesapp.com to encrypt your home folder. \nAbove all else, make sure to keep your laptop safe; don't leave it unattended, keep it with you at all times. Of all the laptops I've had, my data has always been safe, because I always kept it close by. Make sure to keep a better eye on your laptop in the future. \nGood luck, and let me know if you have any more questions. \n", "Q: How can I display contents of trash using terminal?

You can browse the snapshots on he backup drive by date and go to your desktop folder to look for the files you need. \nWhen files go missing, it's either directory corruption or a failing drive.

But this is how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iterm2\n\n*Move ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist to the Desktop\n\n*Reboot (because plist files are protected) \n\n*Launch iterm2 and quit it again to create a new plist file\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist in an editor\n\n*Paste the contents of the plist file on the Desktop into the new one\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: Move focus between buttons in confirm dialogs OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 When I try to export a file with the same name (in InDesign CS6) I get a popup asking if I want to replace the file.\n\nHow can I move focus between the Cancel and Replace buttons using only the keyboard?\nI have found that if I press this sequence Tab > Tab > Space the replace button is pressed instead of cancel, but I get no visual indication this will happen.

I have tried to follow guides to reverse the TRIM but none of them actually work because my disk appears to be not mounted and does not appear in /Volumes/\nWhen I open the Disk utility, the disk is greyed. If I try to mount it, I get an error : Try repairing the disk. And of course, when I run a repair, it fails too. \nSadly I have no recent backup (of course, would be too easy).\nHow can I mount this volume and reverse the TRIM enable?\n\nA: Don't panic! I hope you haven't done irreparable damage with the disk utilities and partitioning, which has nothing to do with the problem. The fix is actually very simple.\nThe grey screen is caused by the non-signed kernel driver for the SSD. Mac OS X won't allow it to load by default, thus you can't access the boot disk.\nThis can happen if you don't turn off the kernel signing check, or if it gets turned on, which it often does during a system update.\nIf you are using Trim Enabler, this article describes how to recover. A similar procedure should work for anything that turned on trim. \nI'm using a Crucial SSD too, with trim enabled. I forgot to turn Trim off before a system update, and had to recover using the instructions on the linked page (successfully).\nBasically it overrides the kernel signing check once again, so you can boot your Mac like before.\nhttps://www.cindori.org/trim-enabler-and-yosemite/\nOnce I was back in, I used the trimforce command to prevent the problem in the future ;-) Trimforce is new in Yosemite, I believe.\n\nA: Did you try fsck as described in this article?\n\n\n*\n\n*Press cmd + S at startup to boot single-user mode\n\n*In terminal /sbin/fsck -fy\nIf single-user mode doesn't work, try this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal: df -hl to find the disk in question.\n\n*then do sudo fsck_hfs -l /dev/disk?\nNB: As described here, OS X provides since 10.10.4 a new tool called trimforce, allowing users to activate TRIM also on unsupported disks. No more dangerous experiments with third party software necessary.\n", "Q: How to identify codec (AAC vs ALAC) used in an m4a file Given that the m4a format is merely a container, and can contain music encoded with a lossy (AAC) or lossless (ALAC) codec, is there a simple way to determine which codec was used for a given file?\n\nA: When I use the file command on an .m4a file, I get back a generic response of \"ISO Media, Apple iTunes ALAC/AAC-LC (.M4A) Audio\" for both AAC and ALAC files. I can think of two other approaches off the top of my head that don't require either the heavy hand of iTunes or installing new software :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the audio file in question with QuickTime Player. Select \"Show Movie Inspector\" from the 'Window' menu (or press ⌘-i) to see the file's size, data rate, and the codec used in its creation.\n\n*Use the afinfo (audio file info) command in Terminal.app to get a more information than QuickTime Player provides. Here's some sample output:\n\n\n$ afinfo /Users/admin/Desktop/01\\ The\\ Guns\\ of\\ August\\ 1.m4a\n\nNum Tracks: 1 Data format: 2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'alac' (0x00000001) from\n16-bit source\n\n4096 frames/packet\n\nChannel layout: Stereo (L R)\n\nestimated duration: 18702.930431 sec audio bytes: 1006059541\n\naudio packets: 201367 bit rate: 430332 bits per second\n\npacket size upper bound: 12334 maximum packet size: 12334\n\naudio data file offset: 48\n\noptimized audio\n\n824799232 valid frames + 0 priming + 0 remainder = 824799232\n\n\n\n\nFor any readers unfamiliar with using the terminal, it's quite simple, and you won't break anything. Open Terminal, and type in--or cut and paste from below--the word afinfo followed by a single space:\nafinfo \n\nNext, drag an audio file over to the Terminal window and drop it in. You will see the file's path get appended to the afinfo command. If dragging the icon caused the Finder to become the active process, you'll need to click on the Terminal's window to wake it up before the final step of pressing enter to run the command. If you like, you can get information on more than one file at a time by dragging and dropping multiple icons instead of just one. When you're finished, just quit Terminal.app as you would any other program.\n\nA: I wanted to do this in order to identify which m4a files in a folder were ALAC and which were AAC. This is easily done to an entire folder like this:\nafinfo ./*.m4a |grep -B 4 alac\nwhich gives a result like:\nFile:           Track 09.m4a\nFile type ID:   m4af\nNum Tracks:     1\n----\nData format:     2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'alac' (0x00000001) from 16-bit source, 4096 frames/packet\n\nTo just get the filenames, I used this:\nafinfo ./*.m4a |grep -B 4 alac |grep File: |sed 's/.*\\///'\nresulting in:\nTrack 09.m4a\n\nA: I ended up looking for this type of question\nas i needed to to look at the top level of my music hard drive to identify\nwhich ones were alac so i could convert them to compressed m4a(aac) for better cross platform capabilities.\nI wrote a function that looks recursively at the current folder ( i.e. if you need to go deeper than beyond the working directory you ran it on )\nif you need to change the depth, the -maxdepth option can be added to the find command in $m4a_files , as well as specifiying paths to not look into, like i have with ! -path \"*.app*\" .\nI used echo to print the command to a variable and run it via eval because I had trouble here and in the past with other command line tools ( like qpdf ) iterating the output of find into another tool via a for loop.\nallu () {\n\n    # alac lookup\n\n    echo\n    echo \"looking up m4a files\"\n    echo\n\n    # bypasses paths with .app in their name so if you run it on some place like ~/Downloads\n    # and you have an app downloaded there it won't look in it\n\n    m4a_files=$( echo $( find . -name \"*.m4a\" ! -path \"*.app*\" | sed \"s|.*|\\\"&\\\"|\" ) );\n\n    # syntax afinfo $m4a_files |grep -B 4 m4a |grep File: |sed 's/.*\\///'\n\n    echo 'checking for alac'\n    echo\n\n    # looks alac files up \n    file_lookup_merger=$( echo \"afinfo\" $m4a_files \"|grep -B 4 alac |grep File: |sed 's/.m4a*\\///'\" ) ;\n\n    # uses eval to return the list of files it found *with srnd. quotes*\n    eval $file_lookup_merger |sed 's/File:           //'| sed \"s|.*|\\\"&\\\"|\";\n    \n}\n\n\nEdit: Come a day later after i wrote the above, I wanted to write a simpler, more cross-compatible verison of this that worked on both mac and linux so I wrote one using Exiftool by Phillip Harvey https://exiftool.org/\n( homebrew install )\nhttps://formulae.brew.sh/formula/exiftool#default\n# finds alac files\n\n( find . -name *.m4a -exec exiftool -T -audioformat -filepath {} \\; )|grep alac\n\n# prints list of alac files for use as a string separated by spaces\n\necho $( ( find . -name *.m4a -exec exiftool -T -audioformat -filepath {} \\; )|grep alac |sed 's.alac..g'|sed \"s|.*|\\\"&\\\"|\")|sed 's.\" /.\"/.g'\n\n\n\nA: If you go to iTunes > View > View Options > Show Columns > Kind it will include a column that tells you if the file is Apple Lossless or AAC\n", "Q: Early 2008 Macbook Pro won't eject Windows 7 Professional disc when prompted Im using an Early 2008 Macbook Pro and I am having a problem completing my BootCamp installation due to the fact that when I am prompted to eject the windows disc, I have no clue how to.

Something happened with the way iOS, Mac OS, and GMail has set up 2-step verification and app-specific passwords that has broken my ability to access/read email across my devices.\nThe only solution I have been able to find is to disable 2-step verification on all my GMail accounts.  This is not ideal for obvious reasons.\nCurrently I am running:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 8.4\n\n*MacOS 10.9.5\n\n*Apple Mail 7.3\n\n\nThe above version of iOS doesn't support app-specific passwords when I add my GMail account.  It redirects me to GMail's login and asks for my Google account password.  However, Apple Mail will not accept my Google account password and requires an app-specific password when 2-step verification is turned on.  I can generate such a password easily, and it works in Apple Mail.  But when I sync between my computer and phone, the result is a conflict where I can receive mail on one device but not the other, because the computer is expecting that the account has only ONE password associated with it.\nThe weird thing is that it has been working until only relatively recently--like last week, it just broke for reasons I can't figure out.\n\nA: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps\nYou probably need to enable access for less secure apps\nLate answer I know but I had the same and it's taken hours to find the fix today \n", "Q: How to sort apps in Launchpad view?

You’ll see a hidden search box appear above the first conversation.\nHow can I reverse this?\n\nA: Once you have revealed it, it stays.  To remove it, you can go into the app switcher (double tap on HOME), and swipe the app away to force it to restart back in the default mode with a hidden search bar.\n\nA: I do believe that is what Apple calls, \"expected behavior.\"\nOn my phone I only have a few threads in the messages list and the search box is always available. If I scroll up the search box behaves like it is part of the list, it scrolls up off the screen and hides.\n\nA: You didn't \"enable\" it. It's just the design of iMessage.

I cannot reimport them again.\nHowever, if you share a picture in a shared album yourself (e.g. originating from the Photos.app on on my Mac), you can import that photo again once in your library. Resulting in duplicate photos. \nThis occurs in the Mac OSX Photos app, version 1.0.1 (215.65.0).\nI'm aware that 'duplicate' in the technical definition may not be accurate; the imported photo in this case will have a different filename and be of lower resolution. But from a functional perspective it IS a duplicate. \nIs there any way to avoid importing these duplicates so every now and then I can safely select and import a bunch of pictures from a shared library, without having to cleanup the duplicates afterwards?\nNote that I've seen a similar older question, which is only for iPhoto.\nUpdate 11 Jan, 2016: This is still an issue with the latest version of Photos v1.3 (350.23.0)\n\nA: I don’t have a full solution to what I analyze as a conceptual bug in iPhoto and Photos:\nthey don’t attempt to avoid duplicates, either real ones or false ones where there is simply 2 different names pointing toward the same internal file ( like link in the Finder do ).\nMy personal work around is purely organizational:\nI strictly respect the following rules:\n\n*\n\n*I only import photos from external sources ( camera, iPhone ),\n\n*On every import I always activate the delete after import option.\n\n*On every import I explicitly select a folder to import to.\n\nThus all my photos are sorted from the beginning, and I avoid any form of duplicate.\nBut to be honest, I feel that Photos needs a serious improvement for people who manage more than a few hundreds pictures.\n\nA: MacPaw Gemini duplicate finder seems to be a good app for this job\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Photos app in OS X as usual.\n\n*Pull down the “Photos” menu and choose “Preferences”\n\n*Under the “General” tab, look for “Importing: Copy items to the Photos library” and uncheck that box to disable image copying.\n\n*Close Preferences.\n\n\nHappy snapping! :)\n", "Q: Can Photos app on macOS sync faces (or People)? I'm running the Photos app on several Macs and have iCloud Photo Library enabled. One of the Macs downloads the originals as well, the others use the Optimize Mac Storage feature. But I can't seem to find out how to sync faces across the devices.\nIn Apple Support article #HT204486 it states the following:\n\nPhotos lets you tag people's faces in your pictures so you can find friends easily. When you use iCloud Photo Library, these faces automatically update on all your devices.\niCloud doesn't automatically update changes to the names associated with Faces or the contents of the Faces photo album in the Photos app. You can tag people's faces with names on multiple Macs, but the face tags and Faces photo albums will remain unique to each computer.\n\nNow I've read this a couple of times but I really can't figure out what this actually means; the first paragraph says \"sure, it can be automatically updated on all your devices\" but the second paragraph states \"but it doesn't update changes\".\nSimply put: is it, or is it not, possible to have the same faces on all my macs? And if so, what is the best approach for periodically assigning photos to faces/people?\nNote that I've seen a similar (one-liner) question, with an appropriate response. But these do not reflect what is stated in the support article.\nUpdate 27 Sep, 2016: now with macOS Sierra and the accompanied Photos app this is still not possible. Meaning the new \"People\" feature is device specific and is not synched into the cloud. And is therefor useless if you have multiple devices. There is another question for this as well.\nUpdate 20 May, 2017: with Photos v2.0 (3150.4.120), on macOS 10.12.5, the \"Faces\" feature has been renamed \"People\". However, it is still not possible to sync people across Macs AND iOS devices.\n\nA: The key part is where it says: \"These items are available only on the Mac where you created them: Faces tiles and Faces data\".\nEssentially, Apple Photos is the next version of iPhoto, but with much better syncing added. However, they haven't yet added sync for everything. I would like to be able to start a book project at home and finish it at my work computer, but because, like faces, books are not yet synced, this isn't possible.\nHopefully, they will start syncing the rest of the data in the next release or two.\n\nA: Faces data is indeed synced.

In linux, one of the great things you could do (for developers, in particular) was to mount a folder and locally bind it to another folder on the system.\nThis had the advantage over symlinks due do the fact tools like Git didn't detect it as being a different type of node, and you didn't need to remove the original contents. When you were done, you could simple unmount and you were left with the original filesystem contents.\nHowever, mount -bind or mount.local don't seem to exist on Mac (as of OS X 10.10.2, Yosemite).\nHow do you go about this?\n\nA: There is another option - bindfs. It requires you to install macFUSE first but provides an alternative to using NFS.\nYou can compile bindfs from source but it's available in MacPorts, Homebrew and pkgsrc  too.\n\nA: As mentioned by another user on StackOverflow, you can use an NFS mount do to this. However, it requires a little bit of one-time setup.\nFirst, you'll need to set up an /etc/exports file (if you haven't done so already).\n$ sudo tee -a /etc/exports <<< \"/ -alldirs -mapall=$USER localhost\"\n\nSecondly, you'll need to start the rpc and nfsd services.\n$ sudo launchctl start com.apple.rpcbind\n$ sudo nfsd start\n\n\nFrom there, give NFSd a little bit to wake up and get breakfast, and you should be good to mount:\n$ sudo mount localhost:/path/to/target ./mnt\n\nTo restore the original contents, just do\n$ sudo umount ./mnt\n\n", "Q: Facetime & Text & Email Hack Is it possible to hack facetime and text messages from a iphone you do not own.

How is this possible and what can be done to stop it?\n\nA: The history of your calls and messages will be stored in your device but in an encrypted manner which even apple doesn't share or record them in iCloud. So FaceTime and iMessage are safe. But if you give your Apple ID and password to someone else, than can have a hand over the messages.

Odd that it didn't. Perhaps someone with more familiarity with XCode can help with that.\nYou could just type the whole path to the app every time you want to use it. But that would be a PITA.\nAdding the path to those apps does not affect anything else, it only gives you easy access to the apps/commands in the path.

I saw an answer that suggested I disassociate my device with this:\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether d4:33:a3:ed:f2:12\nnetworksetup -detectnewhardware\n\nMy question is: will this be permanent? How would I go about undoing this?\nAlso what's the difference between en0 and en1?\n\nA: To your first question \"is it permanent\"-- \nNo it is not, it will revert to the original when you restart. \nThe reason is a MAC address is given to a network adapter (card) when it is manufactured. It is hardwired or hard-coded onto your computer's network interface card (NIC) and is unique to it, so when you restart system will get the hardwired MAC address from the network card. \nHowever there are ways to keep it permanent, but that is another question and method.\nTo your second question:\nOS X uses en0 and en1 to identify the network type.\nDepending on the configuration those could be:\nen0 for the Ethernet (cable) interface\nen1 for the WiFi interface\nBut it is better to look up your specific configuration. \nTo find out the currently used MAC address run ifconfig en1 | grep ether or ifconfig en0 | grep ether in your Terminal app.\n", "Q: Jailbreak: Need Top Option + Restore + Choose ipsw Anymore? Before a device was to be jailbreaked, all the tutorials recommended connecting said device to iTunes and then clicking option + Restore > Choose ipsw.\nRecent tutorials don't include these steps any more. Rather they just mention restoring through iTunes and not over wifi.\nIs the option + Restore > Choose ipsw Necessary Still For Jailbreaking?\n\nA: The basic restore through iTunes will download the latest software image and restore it. This is equivalent to downloading the latest ipsw and using the Option + Restore method. \nThe Option + restore method has typically been useful for situations where you need to restore to an older or modified ipsw file, which was more useful in the earlier days of jailbreaking.\n", "Q: How to resolve the 100% disk usage on my iMac 27\" (late 2013) when in Bootcamp bootup I own an iMac from the late 2013 series, it is the core i7 with 32GB RAM.

This is without loading additional applications, just loading into windows in the first place.\nAfter the system has loaded, it is fast and responsive (i.e. no additional paging or anything). Does anyone know what the resolution for this is?\n\n\nA: The solution to my particular problem is to be found here which suggests excluding the process MsMpEng.exe from the windows defender service. I'm running windows 8.1 so this done by searching for Windows Defender in your programs, clicking on the settings tab (far right) and then browsing to 'C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender\\MsMpEng.exe' and adding it to the excluded files and locations.

The URL you posted is the JRE (which used to be sufficient but in Java 7 onwards on OS X this is the web plugin only - for other OS I think it includes the java command line)\nYou need to go to the JDK downloads\n\nA: It is worth to mention, Apple still providing JDK6 for this newest release (El Capitan), Apple recommend user to use the latest Java from java.com.\nThe \"More Info...\" will actually bring you to java.com to download the latest Java, this is the recommended Java. Some reason you might need JDK6 is mainly for legacy software support, as mentioned on the Apple KB page. For me, I install both JDK8 and JDK6, the font rendering and color have a visible differences in both of these version, at least in JetBrains' product. Here is screenshot taken from JetBrains issue tracker. \n\n\nA: Clicking on the More Info link did not help.  I downloaded Java from Java for OS X 2015-001 (Apple's version of \"legacy\" Java) and the problem is solved for me.  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US \n\nA: The other problem in OS X 10.11 is the new rootless SIP protection which sometimes blocks installation of Java.

If I give Instagram access to my iPhone 6 camera roll, does that mean my followers and people on Instagram, have access to it too? Can everyone see my camera roll photos on my phone? \n\nA: It's not Instagram as a whole which needs access to your camera roll but the Instagram app. Without the access right, the app will not be able to access the camera roll if you want to publish a photo taken outside of the Instagram app.\nBut even with this access right granted, you still are in control of the photos you share with your Instagram friends.

I wonder, which database apple uses for artist pictures in the music app on iOS 8.4 and how missing pictures for certain artists can be added?\nPretty sure it's something internal, but then again, that would make things even more complicated to add missing artist pictures.\n\n\nA: I think the data comes from CDDB, or at least it used to, back in the day. You can edit (only add?) album art in iTunes by dragging image files onto the album art display. I don't know of any way to do it with only iOS.\n\nA: There's no mechanism in iOS for modifying album artwork associated with your music.\nYou'll need to use iTunes on Mac OS X or Windows.

Before I took the picture.\n\nA: Well, that is the proximity sensor which should detect when you hold the phone to your ear and turn off the touch screen, etc. On my iPhone 5 it is only active when I make a phone call or use a App that uses it (e.g. SmartSleep). It is also visible to the eye when you are in a dark room.\nThese (rather old) articles (1, 2) has more info and states that this is a known problem on the iPhone 4.

I am 100% sure than I haven't enabled the \"Photos\" option in my iCloud since I got the phone and created the account.\n\n\nHowever my iCloud is almost full!?\n\nThe size of the photos saved in the cloud matches the size of the photos in \"Photos & Camera\".\n\n\nA: You are confusing your iCloud Backup with iCloud Photo Library.\niCloud Backup by default makes a copy of your whole iOS device, in case you have a problem with it (you erase something by mistake, it gets stolen, lost, damaged) to be able to restore it to the last available backup.\nYou can selectively remove different data from the backup, that —of course— won't be available to restore later on.\niCloud Photo Library is a different service: it will allow you to upload all your full size pictures to iCloud, save a smaller sized copy on your device to save space (if you set it that way) and sync them between different devices.\nSo \"the cloud\" has a copy of your whole phone for backup purposes because you activated iCloud backup. You can deactivate it and erase it, —I would advice to make a local backup regularly with iTunes in that case— or leave out only your pictures from the iCloud Backup, by deselecting the \"Photo Library\" item on the \"Manage Storage\" settings under iCloud Backup (shown in your screen capture).\n", "Q: How to attach video from Photos app to Gmail message I'm using the new Photos app on OS X Yosemite.

I've tried dragging the video from Photos to my Desktop, but I get the following error:\n\nI've also tried searching for the filename in Finder (IMG_2671.MOV), but that yields no results. Does anyone know how to get this working?\n\nA: The Apple Photos app keeps all photos, thumbnails, application settings and other image/video meta-data in it's own package file located at ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary. As such, you won't find the original images or videos in a normal Spotlight search.\nNative OSX applications can present themselves to Photos as a compatible extension. You can see these when right-clicking on a photo or video and selecting share.\nExporting the video from Photos\nAs gmail is not a native application with this capability (and a quick google search suggested no alternatives), you'll need to export the video and attach it manually.\nSelect the video in Photos and choose File -> Export\n\nYou can choose to export the video unmodified. However, as you'll be attaching the video to an email, you may want to choose Export 1 Video and select a smaller Movie Quality so the video will fit within gmail's attachment size limit of 25mb.\n\n\nA: it is much simpler than all that: in Photos open, select the picture, then CTL+Click on it, in the side menu that opens select \"share\", that lets you choose Mail: than it adds itself to a Mail that you can then write.\n\nA: The (ludicrously roundabout and infuriating) solution that worked for me came from a macrumors thread:\n\ndrag the picture(s) from Photos to your desktop and then upload with Gmail from there.\n\nTrying to attach directly from Photos using my browser crashed Chrome multiple times.

Or create as many new windows manually to have the same files, kill the terminal, replace only the window .data files and re-run again.\nHowever if the data files are not inconsistent with plist file, the Terminal will restore the default session overriding your files.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not booting, lost partition I have a big issue with my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.10.4). I tried to enable yesterday the TRIM on my SSD disk (a Crucial I replaced myself). Everything was working fine since months but after restarting the laptop because of a Mac update, it got stuck at boot.\nI have started on the recovery partition. I have tried all the Terminal commands to revert the TRIM (quite easy: touch, rm, cp,...) but I realized that my disk named \"MACBOOK\" was not even mounted in /Volumes.\nSo I opened the disk utility and I tried to mount the disk manually but that failed. I checked the disk, it said it had to be fixed. So I tried to fix it, but this failed too.\nAt this point, I have booted on Disk Warrior that detected an error on the disk: \"Invalid record count\".  Disk Warrior tried to fix it but it went worse:\nthe \"MACBOOK\" partition has disappeared and a new partition named \"Untitled\" has appeared. The disk can now be mounted though but seems empty.\nSo I ran to buy a hard drive dock. I took off the disk from my laptop and plugged it into my brand new dock on my iMac. The disk mounts properly but it is empty.\nI opened the disk utility and I can see the disk. When displaying all partitions in the Debug menu, I can see this:\n\nSo I see the \"Untitled\" but also the \"MACBOOK\". So the partition is still here somewhere.\nWhen I click on \"Untitled\", the disk utility says:\nCapacity: 510Go\nFree: 498Go\nUsed: 11,98Go\nSo clearly, Disk Warrior did something nasty like deleting the index table or such as the disk is now considered as empty.\nNow, I am using a disaster data recovery tool. It finds thousands of files so the data is still on the disk. But files are not properly named. Like \"file00001.png\", \"file00002.png\". That will be very fun to clean all this mess.\nI must precise that FileVault is NOT activated on the disk. My mac was running on Yosemite latest version. The ideal would be to fix the permission but at least I'd love to access the disk and get all my folders and file names back. I have a quite recent backup (3 months), I just need to get what has changed in the meantime. I will reinstall afterwards.\nI am really getting crazy so any idea would be really appreciated.\nThanks a lot\n\nA: What you currently are doing is correct. In this case it is a good idea to quickly restore EVERY file you can find through a file recovery program. You are very lucky that the data was not completely erased. DO NOT WRITE anything else to the disc, as you risk loosing more data. \nIn my personal experience restoring lost data, I usually:\n1. Backup ALL Data I can recover to an External HDD.\n2. Restore from a Time Machine Backup.\n3. Look for missing Data.\n4. Copy from External HDD\nWhich is basically what you said above. There is no other way to recover all the data quickly. Good luck.\n\nA: Sory to say that it looks like you had a major disk crash of some sort. If Disk Utility can't fix it and Diskwarrior also can't repair it it is likely that some or all of your data is corrupted/damaged or just plain gone.\nThe file names you mention \"file000001.png\" and the like are indicative of some serious issue and the files on your drive have been assigned alternate names just to show you that they are there. they can probably be opened (probably) but it is unlikely the original name is anywhere to be found. it is also likely that the same has happened to all the files on the HD.\nA professional data recovery specialist might be able to restore the disk or get you an image of the disk but that kind of service is very expensive. If you can get these files off the drive, I would do so, especially if you don't have a backup.\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news but your description of your symptoms don't paint a pretty picture. Hopefully you have a backup. If so, wipe the drive and restore the OS and your files.\n\nA: I would suggest that you first check the S.M.A.R.T. values of the hard drive, either by booting from a live CD (e.g. Parted Magic) or if you have access to a Windows computer, putting the drive in an external enclosure and checking with tools like HD Tune or HD Sentinel.\nAmongst common errors, reallocated sectors will indicate the presence of bad sectors.\n", "Q: Get full file path on shared network drive when mounted volume includes subfolder We have a shared samba file server with paths like\nsmb://server/folder1/folder2/file.txt\n\nIt is common for people to \"connect to server\" directly to smb://server/folder1/folder2\nThis mounts a volume called \"folder2\".

I have two libraries from the Photos app (version 1.3 on OS X 10.11.2). \nIs it possible to merge them or to move pictures from one library into another?\n\nA: I use PowerPhotos from FatCatSoftware to merge my libraries. I've merged more than 12 libraries and 500 GB of photos.\n\nA: If you use iCloud Photo Library and first upload one library and then make the second library the system library, the first library will get downloaded into the second library (if that makes sense).\n\nA: I would export all the photos from the smaller library, into a folder. Then go into the larger library and import the photos. This keeps metadata and location info in place.\n\nA: The only Apple merge of libraries appeared in Aperture. You could use a third party option like iPhoto allowed, but the main method of merging is to export the photos in whatever organization you want (album oriented) on one Library to the filesystem and then import those into the remaining library.\nThis loses ratings, albums, faces, etc... but not geolocation and edits if you are exporting the edited photos and not the originals.\nI have had limited success putting photos into iCloud Photo library and then deleting that local library after switching the other library to be the \"system library\" but I did have about 3% duplicate photos - so that was several dozen items to find and prune by hand. I wouldn't recommend this since it's not easy to fix iCloud library if it messes up badly. For what it's worth, my cloud library is now 80 GB and 20k items - so unless you are much smaller or larger, you could try that after backing things up.\n", "Q: How far in the future can I create events on my calendar?

Background: I have a MacBook Pro (late 2011) with a SATA III 6Gb SSD installed in place of the optical drive. Sources say this configuration should work, but I've been having problems (read/write failures, spinning beachball, etc) of exactly the sort you would expect if a SATA II bus was trying to operate at SATA III speeds. I'm beginning to suspect that my laptop may have the issue reported for early 2011 MacBooks that made them unstable with 6Gb SATA III. The best solution would be a SATA 2.0 drive, but the drive I have is already in hand.\nIs there any way (preferably through software) to set the SATA Negotiated Link Speed to 3Gb instead of 6Gb?\nEdit: The SSD in question is a Seagate/Samsung 850 EVO (MZ-75E250B/AM), if the solution is drive-specific.\n\nA: So, having verified the drive is, in fact running at SATA-III speeds, it looks like this post describes doing what you need.

The old versions are listed in the \"Purchases\" list within App Store app on my Mac. \nBut when I hit the \"Download\" button a message appears refusing to start the download because my MacBook Pro is too new and does not support that OS.\nOther Questions are similar to this but not quite the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*Others say to use the App Store to download, but no mention of the App Store refusal that I encounter. \n\n*Others suggest using developer.apple.com, but even with a paid membership that download page no longer offers old versions. The Download page offers only 2 versions: the current version (Yosemite) and the future beta (El Capitan).\n\n\nMy goal is to install Mac OS X on a virtual machine, Parallels.\n\n\nA: If you go to developer.apple.com/downloads you will find all downloads that Apple has available.  Limit your search to the \"OS X\" category and you'll see downloads for all versions of OS X from version 10.3 to 10.6. \nI'm guessing that 10.7 and up are missing because starting with 10.7, the OS was only available via the App store. Unfortunately, that means that you'll only be able to get the installer from the App store, and the only way I know of getting older version from the App store is if you have previously \"purchased\" that version and wish to download it again. \n\nA: Apple \"How to download macOS Sierra\" via Mac App Store\nFor those who do not have Apple Developer Subscriptions, Apple also provides an official support article, How to download macOS Sierra:\n\nIf you still need Sierra, follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use this link to open the macOS Sierra page on the App Store: Get macOS Sierra.\n  \n*Click the Download button on the Sierra page.

This might be a bit of an odd one.\nI have a collection on songs in iTunes and I'd like to copy it to an SDCARD to play it on my car's radio, together with the playlists I have to listen to the music in \"proper order\".\nCopying the folder structure in $HOME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/ works fine, and the player can read the files. \nAs for playlists, iTunes allows exporting the playlists in .m3u or .m3u8 format. The paths in the playlist are in \"OSX\" format, but a quick sed one-liner changes the paths to relative ones and puts it in DOS format:\nsed -i.bak -e 's:/Users/jjarava/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music:..:g' -e 's:/:\\\\:g' \"$1\";\n\n(the SDCARD in the car radio is identified as SDCARD:\\)\nI can see the playlist files in the car's radio, but only SOME of the files are \"visible\"/are played from the playlist.\nGiven that all the files \"missing\" contain some extended character (like á, é, í, ó or ú in Spanish). I've been bitten by the different way to encode the names in the past (see Linus Torvalds and the OS X Filesystem for context), so I suspect the issue might be due to the encoding of the file names in the SDCARD. When \"browsing\" the SDCARD I can see the authors/paths properly and all the files are available, so I think it's an issue of the way the paths are read from the .m3u file and (not) resolved to the proper files.\nMy first idea was to write yet another script to look for \"offending\" paths and rename them both in the filesystem and in the playlists, but I'm hitting a wall as find/grep etc seem to have issues working with files with extended characters on them. Something that \"should\" work like:\nfind /Volumes/MUSICA_VW/ -iname '*.mp3' | grep -e '[áéíóú]'\n\nto get the offending songs/paths, returns every single song (i.e, the same results that find alone)\nThe option of renaming the files in iTunes is not really an option, as any time I add music it's got to be \"processed\". I don't care too much about having the proper paths etc in the player, that's why I wouldn't mind doing mass renaming etc as part of the \"export\" but the information on iTunes should be the right one...\nSo before delving in the arcane secrets of bash and findutils, or just byting the bullet and coding something in Python, any suggestions? I'm sure I'm not the first one to have hit this specific issue, I'm sure.\nAnd to any that have taken the time to read so far, THANKS! \n\nA: I've not tested this on a huge hierarchy of nested folders, but assuming you use List view, giving you the opportunity to Opt/click the reveal arrow & then select all -  \nThe Finder since Yosemite has a built-in Search & Replace for file names.\nRight click, Rename [n] items…\n\nI just tested on some recipe text files I intentionally added accented letters to, but it ought to work on any file…\n\nIt does mean you'd have to go through each replacement, one at a time, á é í ó ú etc but it would get there in the end.\nTextWrangler could do the same for the m3u file.\n", "Q: Software to duplicate external hard drive formatted ExFAT I have an external hard drive with a 2.9TB ExFAT partition that I keep my photos and other media on.

(-2741). I assume this means an if is missing a then, but can't see any of those. The other thought I had is that 222:227 indicates columns, but again I don't see how those columns of the command are wrong.\nIs there anyone who can point me in the right direction here please?\n\nA: Before you try running a non-trivial script using osascript, first try compiling it (and running it, if feasible) in Script Editor.\nWhen I compiled your script in Script Editor, it revealed that your script is trying to use the term custom title—a Terminal-specific term—without targeting Terminal, so the term isn't available. Extend your first line, tell … to …, into a tell block:\ntell application \"Terminal Latest\"\n    activate\n\n    set allWindows to number of windows\n    set newTab to true\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to allWindows\n        set allTabs to number of tabs of window i\n        repeat with j from 1 to allTabs\n            if custom title of tab j of window i contains \"Hi\" then\n                set frontmost of window i to true\n                set selected of tab j of window i to true\n                set newTab to false\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nif newTab then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\" to keystroke \"t\" using command down\n    tell application \"Terminal Latest\"\n        do script (\"tabname $2\") in selected tab of the front window\n        set custom title of selected tab of the front window to \"$2\"\n    end tell\nend if\n\ntell application \"Terminal Latest\" to do script (\"$1\") in selected tab of the front window\n\nBut you're going to find that this code still doesn't work, because you're trying to use shell variables $1 and $2 inside single-quoted strings, where the shell won't interpret them. So you'll also need to break up the quoting of those lines, e.g., in your osascript command arguments change\n-e 'do script (\"tabname $2\") in selected tab of the front window'\n\nto\n-e 'do script \"tabname '\"$2\"'\" in selected tab of the front window'\n\n[Untested.]\nAlso, the parentheses were unnecessary.\nHowever, if you're storing this in a shebang script file, you don't need to use a shell to run osascript. You can change the first line to\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\nand then just put your AppleScript code after that, without the -e options, surrounding single-quoting or line-continuation backslashes.\nFinally, since AppleScript supports the hash # comment character, you can edit, compile and run (as appropriate) osascript shebang scripts in Script Editor.\nUpdate: A minute later I realized you want to pass command-line arguments to the script. So, you do want to use a shell to run osascript for your case. However, you can simplify things by using a Here document to place the script inline:\nosascript<<EOF\n    <your script here>\nEOF\n\nVariables/arguments will be expanded.\n\nA: This might help you with a couple of methods to overcome your issue I believe:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6964486/osascript-syntax-error-expected-end-of-line-but-found-command-name-2741\n", "Q: How to fix 'half-ejected' state of non-connected drive I have a backup drive that I have set up to not automount (via editing /etc/fstab)\nI use Superduper to mount the drive, backup overnight and then unmount on exit\nThis morning I opened my laptop to go to work and found the drive in this greyed out 'half-ejected' state:\n\nI can right click and select 'Eject \"TB Backup\"' but nothing happens. I unplugged my laptop from the dock at home and went to work.  I got no errors when unplugging.\nNow I'm at work with my laptop and the icon is still there in greyed out state, even though the drive is no longer even connected.  'Ejecting' still does nothing.\nI guess it might fix itself if I reboot or just reconnect and mount the drive when I get home.\nThe drive does not show up in Disk Utility at the moment.\nI'm on Mavericks 10.9.5\nAny ideas how to fix without rebooting?  Any potential issues when I remount the drive tonight?\nSuperDuper logs show no problem:\n| 03:24:02 AM | Info | PHASE: 4. And Finally...\n| 03:24:02 AM | Info | ...ACTION: Scheduling TB Backup to eject when SuperDuper! quits\n| 03:24:02 AM | Info | ......COMMAND => Ejecting TB Backup\n| 03:24:02 AM | Info | Copy complete.\n\n\nA: Aside from restarting the system, there are probably a half-dozen straightforward, reliable and perfectly appropriate ways to go about completing the process of fully detatching a drive which unexpectedly stopped prematurely at the point of unmounting. I had two terminal commands which would get the job done come to mind immediately, and I know them both well enough to feel no need to double-check the man pages before typing away. That said, my advice is to deal with the situation by... restarting the system. Let the OS run the myriad of shutdown and startup integrity checks and multi-step boot-time safety procedures and recovery functions we have no idea even exist. While I'm adventurous enough to mount shadow-file disk images in the kernel [/usr/sbin/hdik], I defer to the authority of the local filesystem structure when it comes to keeping an eye on the integrity of my backup drives.\nI further suggest that before engaging in any direct action on the drive, you check SuperDuper's log. Had something gone Terribly, Terribly Wrong, SuperDuper would have announced it at the time, so that's not the reason for taking a look. I suggest it on the odd chance of encountering a hint about the source of the glitch.\nLikewise, consider checking /var/log/diskarbitrationd.log for its take on recent events and the opportunity of greater enlightenment. (Naturally, I won't mention taking a passing glance at the content of /etc/fstab.)\nedit :: supplemental information\nThe two commands which occurred to me were umount﹡ and diskutil.\nI looked over the documentation for umount to ensure my memory of its usage was reasonably accurate. I was confronted with the revelation that for, oh, twenty years or so, I had overlooked the man pages' NOTES section, fully quoted herewith:\n\nDue to the complex and interwoven nature of Mac OS X, umount may fail often. It is recommended that diskutil(1) (as in, ``diskutil unmount\n  /mnt'') be used instead.\n\nWhat can I say? Due to the complex and interwoven nature of my residual cognitive capacity, I may fail often.\nAs for diskutil, the particular command I would have issued turned out to be a valid one: diskutil unmountDisk force [device]. You'll want to consult the manual pages for full usage options and syntax.\nRegarding the non-existence of /var/log/diskarbitrationd.log: apparently, you foolishly neglected to create it… Oh… Wait…\nI sometimes [see ¶ four, above] forget that this or that background process I have running is not part of a default OS installation. That was the case here with the disk arbitration server daemon, located at /usr/sbin/diskarbitrationd. No sense in your bothering with it now.\nIf you care to, and at your convenience, consider using Disk Utility to examine the backup drive's partition scheme and filesystem. If more than one volume exists on the device, which is likely not so for a backup drive, hold down the ⌘-Command key while clicking on the device name along with the indented volume names below it. Then use the Verify Disk option in the First Aid tab to check the drive for errors. \n\n﹡ Not a typo. \n", "Q: Unable to boot (kernel panic - reboot cycle) after 10.10.4 upgrade Macbook pro early 2011, after 10.10.4 upgrade does not boot then gives the standard \"you have a problem\" message, then panic message again etc. I've attached an image below:\n, \nAfter ⌘Command-R reinstallation of OS the first time it works, but the same cycle after rebooting. \nApplecare service installed fresh OS (erased the disk), it works, bit after I restored the system from backup (I needed the files and programs installed) then same problem.

Not only does\n  it do keystone correction, but it can also fix wide angle lens\n  distortion.\n\nI tested it with a snapshot of Minneapolis. (I didn't spend a lot of time on this.  Just to test.)\n\n\n\nA: The SCRWE is still limited. Desktop Photoshop has the answer when applying Crop you can put a check mark on Perpective control and apply one side or all of them, really cool. I tried to find an iOS app to do that but not found any yet.\n\nA: Your first shot of Minneapolis is closer to reality than the distorted one you \"corrected\" in the app. Perspective is not the same thing as lens distortion. The top of the building is further away from your eye so it should appear smaller when flattened in 2D. The bottom photo can't exist in reality so I have no idea why everyone wants photos to have parallel lines. iPhone cameras do this distortion thing automatically with the camera software and I hate it. \n", "Q: IPhone app to block callers at specific times?

This is why: While it's already improbable enough that the Caffe devs would include a pre-release beta in the dependency chain of their product, and while that prospect becomes all the more unlikely when rdeps does not encounter libgcc-devel, it is clearly ludicrous to believe Caffe would take the risk of colliding with the real GNU compiler collection.\nNot long ago, yet I forget the project, autotools (autoconf, automake) consistently misinterpreted OS X 10.10 kernels as 10.1 versions, and configured their builds for that environment.\nWhat do you get when you run port rdependents libgcc-devel? Have you opened a ticket? Parsed the makefile?\n\nA: libgcc-devel (the pre-release version of libgcc, installed e.g. when installing gcc6) conflicts with and supersedes (at least in my case) the normal libgcc. Ports depending on the latter will instead use the former, so any dependency on libgcc become one on libgcc-devel. For this reason, libgcc-devel was required to build caffe on my system.\nSee the ticket: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/48461\n", "Q: Uninstall Windows Virtual PC I was looking for Parallels in DreamSpark earlier on today and thought I would install 'Windows Virtual PC' since I found it. The only issue is I have installed it on Yosemite (2015 MBP) and Finder says 'You cannot use this application since PowerPC apps are no longer supported'.\nI tried to use the uninstaller, the only issue is it has the same error (the uninstaller is a PowerPC app too)! How would I get rid of this application (I don't think I can just drag the application into the trash since the computer needed to reboot)?\n\nA: One way to determine what an installer package is going to install (or installed) and where, is to look at the installer package with Pacifist as it will give you the hierarchal folder layout of files installed outside the application bundle as well.\nThis can be used to aide in a manual uninstall as necessary if AppCleaner does not do a complete job of uninstalling.\n", "Q: Old password not being accepted when attempting to change password I was trying to change my password from System Preferences on my MacBook Pro. I followed the procedure by filling in the old password along with the new one. However, I am informed that the old password is incorrect! I tried several times but it didn't succeed. The old password is not working so the newer one is not being set.\n\nA: You can reboot into recovery and run resetpassword from Terminal to reset your password.\n", "Q: Can't see imported pictures on my iPhone I copied the pictures from my USB to the 100APPLE folder where my pictures are. I copied them succesfully, but I cannot see the pictures on my iphone.\nWhy is this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: You haven't imported them—just copied them into the folder. The Photos app doesn't know that the photos are there. You need to import them properly, through iTunes or saving them manually on the device.\n", "Q: How do I activate middle-click to close browser tab?

Now \"Mac OS X cannot start up from this disk\". (and cannot install to this disk!) I have a mid-2009 macbook pro, and the original 10.6.8 installer DVD that it came with.  I booted up in recovery mode, and erased the HD (whether or not that was a good idea). My intention was to get rid of old private files, and then update the OS to something current (hopefully 10.10.4), (so the machine could be used in a public setting), using an internet connection while in recovery mode.  But I found that the install OS option, while in recovery mode, fails with, \"Mac OS X cannot start up from this disk\".\nI am thinking, \"Of course it cannot start up from that disk, because there is nothing on it yet!  And how can there be something on it if you will not let me install something!\"  Argh.\nSo then I thought maybe I should have 10.6.8 already running (again) on the laptop before I try to update that OS.  But then I get the same result, \"Mac OS X cannot start up from this disk\", when I try to install even 10.6.8 from the original installer disk.\nCan anyone better at this level of macs shed light on what I need to do?  \n\nA: Start from the original disk, open disk utility and reformat the disk. Then reinstall. \n", "Q: Install an older iOS beta prerelease My phone was running iOS 9 beta 3 last night when my last backup happened. Today Apple gave me a new phone but when I got home I realized that my version of iOS is iOS 9 beta 4 and my backup will not restaure... Argh.\nHow can I get iOS 9 beta 3 on this new phone?\n\nA: You can always restore a backup of an older version of iOS onto a newer version of iOS, just not vice versa.\nIf you really want to install an older pre-release version of iOS, then you can if you still have the IPSW. Apple doesn't stop signing pre-release versions like this so you should still be able to install an older version through iTunes.\n", "Q: Safari on OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 CPU problem Since a couple of days I have problems with the CPU usage of my Safari installation. It runs on OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (MacBook Pro 13\" from 2011).\nTo reproduce it I only have to open one empty tab and do not need to interact with Safari. After a few seconds the CPU usage goes extremely up. Also the fan is mostly on full speed and the Laptop gets quite hot.\nBut within that situation if I would open new tabs and browse web content it would work without problems. But then when I want to close Safari it hangs. I can only close it by killing its process.\nSo I tried analyzing it a bit by having a look at the process:\n\nHere it shows that Safari has 98.4% CPU and a quite huge CPU time of 30:13,03.\nI then had a look on what happens inside the process by looking at the call graph, but I did not find anything suspicious (but to be honest I am not a C or Apple expert).\nI found some similar articles about Safari CPU problems which are caused by the discoveryd process. But as far as I understood those problems are already solved with Yosemite 10.10.4.\nAny ideas about how I could track down the problem and fix my Safari installation?\n\nA: I found a way to reset my Safari installation this way:\n1) I created a backup of my bookmarks:\ncp ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist ~/Desktop/\n\n2) I deleted some Safari specific files:\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari \\\n       ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari.SearchHelper \\\n       ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari \\\n       ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies \\\n       ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.plist \\\n       ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist \\\n       ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.Extensions.plist \\\n       ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.LSSharedFileList.plist \\\n       ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.RSS.plist \\\n       ~/Library/PubSub/Database \\\n       ~/Library/Safari\n\n3) Then I restored my bookmarks:\nmkdir ~/Library/Safari && mv ~/Desktop/Bookmarks.plist ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist\n\nNow the CPU and the fan stay calm.\n\nA: Had same issue. I disabled plugins under safari preferences / security / plug inns , started up safari, problem gone. I quit safari, enabled the plug ins again , problem remains gone. Magic.\n", "Q: Safari in 10.10.4 completely non-functional after simple preferences change Pressed for time?: one simple question at bottom (thanks)\nSafari in 10.10.4 has just become non-functional, immediately after I made a simple preferences change to what new windows displayed (I don’t recall exactly what that was, but I was trying to get new windows to display empty and without the sidebar being open).\nI restarted twice, and used Disk Utility to do a Permissions Repair and Verify Disk (indicated OK), then restarted again.\nI have zero extensions installed; in fact, I had turned off Safari Extensions completely.\nSafari opens, but with no window; the spinning beach ball spins indefinitely, and I have no access to any of the top menu.\nAs Safari’s been acting sporadically odd anyhow since I upgraded from 10.6.8 to 10.8 to 10.10.4, I just installed Safari 9.0 (beta) per suggestion elsewhere here in late 2014;  no change, even after a restart.\nNo apparent problems except sporadic sluggishness with any other programs I use regularly (Mail, BusyContacts, BusyCal, Pages, TextEdit, Excel).\nI had been experiencing sporadic weirdness (not just in Safari) since resolving the disaster of my 24 June upgrade from 10.6.8 > 10.8 (I wanted to stop there for awhile to clean up and export from an ancient contact management program that wouldn't work beyond 10.8), done by the local Apple Store (“We didn’t lose any of your data but we can’t find any of it.”; they found it all, but it took days).\nThree days ago, because of such sporadic weirdness, as I usually do, I used Disk Utility to first do a Permissions Repair and then Repair Disk. Repair Disk failed, so I followed the recommendation to repair from the Recovery HD. \nStill some sporadic sluggishness and occasional weirdness system-wide, and some of the symptoms matched those described in Apple’s instructions for reset SMC and reset NYRAM, so I did both (exactly as the instructions indicated, and in proper order).\nPerhaps I'm down to one simple question:\nI've never done this: What’s the worst that can happen if I re-install the system using the recovery HD (accessed by holding command-R at start-up) immediately after doing 2 Time Machine backups to two separate external hard drives?\n\nA: I wouldn't expect reinstalling the system using the Recovery HD to cause any significant problems. Minor things that come to mind are reinstallation of fonts in /Library/Fonts if they'd been previously removed, and the possibility of needing to reactivate copy-protected software, e.g. reentering the Microsoft Office serial number. But you've no doubt faced these same issues with the previous upgrades.\nYou could do a trial run without making any changes to your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your boot drive to a new or empty external drive.\n\n*Reinstall OS X on the cloned drive.\n\n*If things look good, reinstall on the original drive, or clone back.\n\n", "Q: How does jailbreaking void the apple warranty when no software as changed? This question has been bugging me for some time.\nHow does jailbreaking void any apple warranty when no software is changed? Sure, cydia is installed but this dosen't change the operating system in any way.\nWith android, there is a reason why the warranty can be void, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Custom recovery flashing\n\n*Custom Operating Systems (e.g Cyanogen Mod (Or Custom ROMS))\n\n*SuperUser\n\n*Modifying the boot screen\n\n*Changing system files\n\n\nOne time I went to my phone store to have my android phone repaired, I said it was rooted, but they still got on with it. \nNow take the iOS version of jailbreaking, all you can do is simply change boot screens, probally apply a theme, and thats about it. There are MANY more things but would take too long to type.\nAnd if your iOS device has a problem (e.g wifi not working) Apple support will just be like 'Nope. Sorry can't do it, its jailbroken' and turn it down. Yet all they have to do is just DO A SYSTEM RESTORE. Not many people know how. Thats why if jailbreak is the cause they have to deal with it themselves.\nSo at the end of this, Why? Why does apple say no jailbroken devices when you cant change the software?\n\nA: Although I don't feel this question is appropriate for here, there is an article published by Apple on their take of Jailbreaking:\nApple: Jailbreak\nEssentially, it IS modified software. A jailbroken OS requires modification to the OS to run - else, you'd just be able to download Cydia and get along with your business. That, in turn, allows unsupported/unapproved software to run on the phone, certain security practices can be avoided, and things of that nature. While it is possible for that to happen through a device that hasn't been rooted, this is their main beef. \nSince it's such an unpredictable situation (eg. they can't necessarily say which App caused the WiFi to stop working, or if a system file was modified by the end user, and so on), it's better to err on the side of liability and make the customer assume responsibility for the software restore. That way, they can use approved methods of repair and not get lost down a rabbithole of troubleshooting.\n", "Q: Is it possible to tell if a Macbook hard drive was booted internally versus externally (usb, firewire, etc.)? Is it possible to tell from system.log or other logs whether a macbook pro hard drive was booted internally or taken out and booted externally (from USB, for example) ? I'm thinking the \"BSD root\" or \"Got boot device\" entries could be relevant, but I'm not sure.

A post in the Apple discussions link says that there would be firmware logs (note Target Disk Mode is activated in the EFI before the OS loads) in /var/log/system.log:\nkernel: hfs: mounted YourDiskName on device  diskXsX\n\nNote this looks like a kernel log to me, so I'm not sure I believe it, but it may well be the firmware kernel mounting the drive (something has to). \nAs dwbrecovery points out (the user who suggested checking the logs), anyone who boots your Mac in target disk mode has unfettered access to your data. They could edit logs, make changes, and change time stamps to it would be impossible to know they were there. \n", "Q: Recover deleted .SKETCH files I recently deleted some sketch files that I would like to try to get back if I can. I trashed them over a month ago, I used stellar phoenix to attempt to recover them, and it found the files. It did ask file size when creating a .sketch header, unlike the pre-configured headers (which have an exact file size set). The files are around 5.0 mb, so thats what I set for the max file size. When the files appear after recovery, the finder shows they're all (but one file) 5.0 mb. I try to open one, but then I receive \"The document \"filename.SKETCH\" could not be opened.\" message. Am I approaching this all wrong, or are they just gone?\nThanks everyone\n\nA: All file recovery software does the same thing: searches the disk for places where files are but the catalog says are free.\nThe single most important thing to do to ensure that you can recover an accidentally deleted file is recoverable is to do nothing to the HD. If it is the OS disk then just using the computer runs the risk of the OS writing to some or all of the space that the deleted file occupies.\nSo when you recover a file you should always recover it to another volume. As recovering to the same volume can be overwriting other files you may need to recover.\nAfter a month I am surprised there was even 5MB left that was recoverable. If that was all the recovery software found and the files are not openable it is unlikely they ever will be.\nThe first time this happened to me I went out and bought a backup drive and software. It's a lot easier than file recovery.\n\nA: You might have better luck with File Salvage or Data Rescue. Both have free trials. However, as another user said, working from the disk where the files were lost decreases the chances of recovery.\n", "Q: Change voicemail message to audio file I have just got an iPhone and would like to change the voice message that people hear when I don't answer their calls.\nIs there a way how I can setup the voice message to an audio file I have? I would like to do this because I have one of the funny ones you here time to time.\nAlso is there a maximum time limit for this?\n\nA: To answer the first question regarding changing your voicemail greeting, you're carrier network may have a different number to access your voicemails. By calling the voicemail number, you should be able to change this to what you want.\nAs for your second question, a solution could be play the audio file whilst your changing it from calling the voicemail number itself.\nAgain, depending on what carrier you use, they may set different time limits for voicemail greetings. For example Virgin Mobile from where I come from has a set voicemail greeting length of 3 minutes. Not sure what you're carrier has set a limit for voicemail greetings.\n\nA: This is not generally something that Apple supports. However when you backup your phone to your computer the voicemails are (usually) saved in the backup.\nThere are programs out there that let you open up an iPhone backup and extract the contents, including voicemail files.\nI will leave the discovery of these iPhone Explorer utilities between you and your favorite search engine.\n", "Q: How can I simply and reliably track my computer usage? I'm not after time tracking for the purpose of invoicing. I'm not even interested in which apps I use. I just want to know how much time I spend each day at my computer. One big pitfall I see is that many apps will suspend tracking when the user is watching a longer video or reading a long article. Are there any apps that work around this successfully, maybe by using the FaceTime camera as an additional source of data?\n\nA: I've used RescueTime for years and it's been an informative little app. \nThey present your time consumption on a nice dashboard and you can categorize it and rate the productivity of your activities from \"Very distractive\" to \"Very productive\", set goals, etc.\n\nIf you wish they can send you a weekly digest email.\nFrom what I've read on their forums –I don't watch movies on my computer– YMMV with movies; VLC seems to have problems being captured after the defined idle time, which is 5 minutes and other similar activities may have the same problem. Hangouts appeared as problematic while searching for \"movies\" on their site to answer this. \nThis is what they say regarding idle time:\n\nWhen RescueTime detects that your computer is idle (no keyboard or mouse activity), it begins a 5 minute timer. At the end of five full minutes of inactivity, RescueTime will close the most recent record and subtract 5 minutes of time from that record.\n\nIf you are willing to pay, they offer a premium subscription that allows you to edit your idle time:\n\nIf you are a Premium user and have offline time enabled, you will get a pop up after becoming active again that will allow you to enter what you were doing when away from the computer, unless this time exceeds 4 hours. If your time away is greater than 4 hours, you can enter time manually on the Offline Time Entry page\n\nIt works on OS X and Windows. \n\nA: I'm using ActivityWatch for about half a month and it really like it. So I recommend you try it :)\n                     \n\nActivityWatch is an open-source automated time tracker that’s\ncross-platform, extensible, and privacy-first.\nWe started building it years ago because we wanted highly detailed\nautomated time tracking without having to run a proprietary app (that\nmight not work on all platforms) or worse, sending it off to some\ncompany server.\nFeatures:\n\n*\n\n*Tracking – Tracks active application and window title out of the box, more with watchers.\n\n*Categories – Get a better overview of your usage by breaking it down into categories.\n\n*Browser extensions – Track the active tab using the extensions for Chrome and Firefox.\n\n*Editor plugins – Track how you spend time writing code with editor watchers.\n\n*Privacy – Data is stored locally and doesn't leave your device, we put local and privacy first.\n\n*Cross-platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.\n\n\nOriginaly posted by Erik Bjäreholt on Quora\nBy the way, it also monitors your computer usage when you're idle and computer isn't sleeping or turned off ;)\n\nAnother option is to use the built-in Screen Time app, which is however only available in macOS Catalina or later...\n", "Q: Switching spaces on one monitor affects open applications on other monitor; looking to prevent this Kind of hard to describe.  Using Yosemite 10.10.3.  Using a mac with two monitors.  Left monitor has one desktop space.  Right monitor has two desktop spaces.\nI use a lot of terminal windows at work (4 on my left monitor, primary (and only) desktop space, and 4 on my right monitor but on the secondary desktop space… that means my left monitor has one desktop space and my right monitor has two desktop spaces) but I noticed that they are NOT separated by the physical monitors.  Specifically, if on my right monitor, secondary space, I go and bring a different application \"to the front\" (and therefore, showing \"on top\" of any other windows I might have open, such as my browser) it will automatically bring another window from that application \"to the front\" on my LEFT monitor.  Details of my specific problem below:\nWhat I like to do is switch to the secondary desktop space on my right monitor when I need to use those 4 terminal windows when troubleshooting something, but at the same time I need my left monitor to not show its OWN 4 terminal windows since I need to be reading documentation or something and at the same time use my right monitor primary desktop space for documentation as well.  In this ideal situation, I would have let's say two browsers on both monitors (left monitor, primary desktop space; right monitor, primary desktop space) and 4 terminal windows readily available for when I need to use them (right monitor, secondary desktop space).\nWhen I swipe my magic mouse on my right monitor in order to view the secondary desktop space, which is where I keep 4 extra terminal windows on my right monitor, it automatically brings the last used terminal window on the left monitor to the front view, blocking the application (browser, in this example).  I have confirmed that the specific terminal window on the left monitor that comes \"to the top\" and covers my browser is the last terminal window that my mouse has clicked on prior to clicking on my browser on the left monitor (in order to bring my browser \"to the front\" or \"on top\" so I can read).\nAs I swipe back and forth between spaces on my right monitor, I have to constantly move my mouse to the left monitor and click on my browser in order to bring it to the front and hide the terminal window.  I have to keep doing this over and over and over and over… very annoying, and I can't figure it out.\nI know this isn't the best explanation (it is Friday, and I am tired), but I think I made myself clear enough to anyone who uses dual monitors on Mac.\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening?  If Terminal (as a program) was treated as an individual \"entity\", then I would expect all 4 terminal windows on the left monitor to \"pop up\" to the front and cover my browser application, but instead only one does but not the others.\n\n*More importantly, how can I fix this so that each terminal window is \"independent\" and won't be influenced by other terminal windows.\nI tried a multitude of combinations turning off/on the four options in Mission Control (auto rearrange spaces; switch to a space with open windows; group windows by application; displays have separate Spaces).  All four of these do not clear my problem.\nThe \"Auto rearrange spaces based on most recent use\" definitely has something to do with this though.  When I type on one of the 4 terminals on the left, reproduce the problem, the last terminal window I typed on is the one that pops up.  I was able to change which ones pop up to the front on the left monitor by typing on a different terminal window on the left.  Unfortunately, declicking Auto rearrange spaces based on msot recent use does not fix this.\nIt appears I am looking for an \"Do not bring last used windows to the front when alt-tabbing (yes I am going to use a Microsoft term) between programs\" option.\nInstructions to reproduce my issue:\nSet up so you have dual monitors; one space on left monitor, two spaces on right monitor.  Open 8 terminal windows in your left monitor. I believe Terminal will automatically open the windows in the left monitor. Swipe your right monitor to the secondary desktop space. Move four out of the 8 terminal windows to right monitor secondary space. Move right monitor back to primary space. Open browser in left monitor to cover all terminal windows. Swipe right monitor to secondary space that has 4 terminal windows. Click on one of those right monitor terminal windows. The last used terminal window on the left monitor will pop up (a.k.a \"bring to the front\") covering your browser\n\nA: I'm going to post this as an answer, even though it's not the one you probably wanted...\nYour issue is that you have one app spread to two Spaces.  \nThere is no fix for this at present, short of duplicating the app & re-defining it at OS-level to be recognised by the System as an independent app [which, as I understand, must be done at compile. I'm not a coder, but I've had this explained to me by one who is, for a very similar usage case I employ myself.]\nA workaround might be to employ two completely different apps as Terminal emulators & keep one in each Space.\nBTW, the quirk of only one window coming to the front is a Yosemite bug, mainly but not entirely fixed in El Capitan. You can temporarily cure it by killing the Dock & letting it respawn. This works some of the time. If it doesn't, a reboot should, for a while.  \nIt's actually triggered by - you guessed it... having windows for one app spread across two Spaces ;-)\n", "Q: Duplicate songs in Apple Music after syncing Yesterday I switched from a PC to a MBP. I've been using Apple Music since it came out. I synced my phone and today I noticed many songs are duplicated, or extra songs I have deleted before are back on my phone, but all of those songs are grayed out and unplayable. The only option I get when I tap on it is to add it to a playlist or delete the song.\nI can still play all my original songs, but the broken songs take up a lot of screen space. How can I get rid of these songs without manually deleting them all?\n\nA: You can make iTunes detect duplicate songs by going to View -> Show Duplicate items and delete your duplicate songs from here.\nIf some of the songs you have haven't been downloaded for offline play, you can also click in View -> Only Music Available Offline to show only the songs that you've downloaded on your system.\n", "Q: Can I use my unlimited Verizon data plan on my iPhone 5s and connect to my 2015 Cadillac Escalade Wi-Fi and AirPlay to my media center?

I've been waiting for a little over an hour for it to install. I am using a PowerMac G5 dual-core with leopard.\n\nA: It all depends on your internet speed, such as a slow 3mbps (megabits, not megabytes per second) or a fast 40mbps. You can calculate the time it should take by dividing your connection speed (in megabits) by 8 (8 bits in a byte), then dividing your download size (in megabytes) by that number. I use an iPhone app called Ookla Speedtest, it's free, but ad-supported and seems to work well.\n\nA: Not long to start the install. Open the log file and look for progress. Command-L and then Command-3 shows all details.\n", "Q: Guest account as sandbox? How much extra security do I get by downloading and running code only in a guest account. My normal user data is safe.

I figure I can run as guest and that shouldn't have write access to much. Is there a way to run a normal GUI app in something like a FreeBSD jail?\n\nA: In reality, little to none. The best result would be having less downloaded junk in your normal user account. \nOS X is sandboxed by default. Applications are by default run in a sandboxed environment without root privileges. Your best bet for security is trusting the sources you download code from, and being wary of code that asks for administrator or elevated privileges. \n", "Q: How to get Mac Mail to show different Gmail addresses in the reply to field? I have a primary gmail account: me@gmail\nMy employer set up email that forwards to gmail as a different identity: me@mtk.org\nMe@gmail downloads to my Mail inbox on Mac. I can reply to messages sent to thus account from my Mac. \nMail sent to @mtk.org Also downloads to the mail inbox on the Mac   BUT I CANNOT reply to these messages from the mtk email - it does not show up as an option in to select in the From drop down menu in Mail.  It would not be appropriate for me to reply to these messages from my personal Gmail address. Work email needs to be responded to from the work address   \nHow do I get the MTK email address to show up in the drop-down menu on the Mac so that I can reply using that address? \n\nA: I use Gmail for Work along with Mac Mail and how I got around this was by opening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences > Accounts\n\n*Then in the Email Address field I put a comma after the address that was there and then added the other address I wanted to be able to reply from. For me I added 4 different ones just by separating with a space and comma like this:\n\n\nme@gmail.com, me@mtk.org, sales@mtk.org\nNow, when I compose an email, there is a a drop down menu that allows me to choose which address I want to send my message from. The only caveat here, is that all of my addresses end in the same business name and it sounds like yours don't. I don't know how your boss has gmail for work set up, but this is easy to change and worth a try! If it doesn't work you can just go back to how the account was setup before, no harm, no foul.\n\nA: Was the me@mtk.org account added separately to Mail or the Mac? If not, you'll need to disable forwarding of the me@mtk.org account to the me@gmail account and add the me@mtk.org account to Mail or the Mac.\n\nA: If you want to be able to reply with a specific FROM email address, you need to set up this email account in Apple Mail.\nWhen the new email account has been set up, you'll under the new email account's 'Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)' setting have the server to use when replying - and by having this new account, you'll be able to choose it from the drop-down as the reply FROM address.\nEDIT:\nWhen you have set up the new mail account for @mtk.org, you'll have set up (configured) the Outgoing Mail Server too - and this Mail Server could be using your current GMail Server identity setup, which will work the same as 'kristcarmen' suggested in his answer, or it could be the correct Outgoing Mail Server used with @mtk.org, if the last, then all @mtk.org mails will be replyed 'the correct way'.\nNeeded server identity for your @mtk.org Mail Server: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203995 - if you look at your current GMail account set up, you can see what you need - so you need to get the same kind of server identity informations for setting up your @mtk.org account.\nIncoming mail server settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Account Type: Choose IMAP*, POP, Exchange IMAP, or Exchange EWS1, as directed by your email provider. If you're using a Microsoft Exchange account, see the Exchange setup instructions for Mac or iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\n*Incoming Mail Server (host name): The host name of the incoming mail server, such as mail.example.com.\n\n*User Name: Your user name for this account, such as appleseed. Some email providers want your full email address as your user name.\n\n*Password: The email password you use to sign in to your account.\n\n*Port: The port number used by the incoming mail server. Common port numbers for incoming mail are 143 and 993 for IMAP accounts, and 110 and 995 for POP accounts.\n\n*Authentication: Choose Password, MD5, NTLM, Kerberos, or None, as directed by your email provider.\n\n*Use SSL? Does the incoming mail server support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption?\n\n\nOutgoing mail server (SMTP) settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outgoing mail server (SMTP): The host name of the outgoing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server, such as smtp.example.com.\n\n*Port: The port number used by the outgoing mail server. Common port numbers for outgoing mail are 25, 465, and 587.\n\n*Authentication: Choose Password, MD5, NTLM, Kerberos, or None, as directed by your email provider. If None, you may need the additional settings below to send email when you're on a different network, such as from a Wi-Fi hotspot or Internet cafe.\n\n*Use SSL? Does the outgoing mail server support SSL or TLS encryption?\n\n\nA: You can add multiple Email Addresses for a single account in Mac Mail.\nOnce you do this, all of these addresses will be available in the \"From\" field of new mails.\nTo add new addresses, go to the preferences in Mac Mail and select your gmail account under \"Accounts\". In the \"Account Information\" tab you will find an \"Email Address\" pop up menu where you can choose \"Edit Email Addresses…\" to add/remove addresses to the given account.\nHowever, gmail might prevent you from sending mails from an email address that is not part of your account. It might still accept your mail but then change the \"From\" address before delivering it. So, better check whether this works before sending important mails...\n", "Q: Shell Script Commands Work Fine in Terminal But Not Via AppleScript I have two commands that I need to run through the Terminal.

However, when running this in AppleScript:\ndo shell script \"cd /Users/Peter1/Desktop\"\ndo shell script \"curl 'www.google.com'>google.txt\"\n\nIt produced the error:\nsh: google.txt: Permission denied\n\nWhy is this happening? What can I do to fix it?\nThanks\n\nA: Your script above is running two different scripts. One is changing the working directory to your user desktop folder (~/Desktop). The other script is downloading www.google.com and putting it in a document in your root directory (/), which doesn't have permissions to do so.\nYou can fix this by reduce it to one statement of do shell script like such:\ndo shell script \"curl www.google.com > ~/Desktop/google.txt\"\n\nIn short, the script first downloads the contents of the website www.google.com and then creates a new file at the specified directory. You may also notice the ~ character, which is equivalent to /Users/username/.\n", "Q: How do i get old external drive data onto new external drive (but not also on computer HD) EDIT:Let me try again.\nSorry guys I'm fairly adept at understanding things in regards to these machines, but I'm by no means a pro.

The larger cache on the Core i will mean that spreadsheets approaching the 5-megabyte range will process appreciably quicker. \nTo build on the theme of low-latency data access, I believe that all Core 2 CPUs use DDR2 memory, while the MacBooks will use DDR3, so you'll feel faster start up times and have an easier time using multiple applications or spreadsheets. \nThe last piece to consider is the longer instruction pipeline means that the Core i series can do much more with each \"tick\" of the processor. \nAll in, you'll likely feel an increase in speed and peppy-ness over your iMac with a newer MacBook (though the MacBooks won't quite keep up with a new iMac). That all being said, I'm just some random guy on the internet who copy/pasted some Wikipedia links. Go to an Apple Store and try one for yourself to see if it's actually worth the money to upgrade!\nEdit:\nFor July of 2015, the relevant processors' passmark scores are:\n\n\n*\n\n*2009 27\" iMac (T7300) with 1201\n\n*2015 13\" MacBook Pro (5257U) with 4608\n\n*2015 12\" MacBook (5Y31) with 2484\n\n\nTo answer the original question, from a purely CPU-based perspective there is an appreciable increase in performance, though it may be worth noting the value-based scores passmark gives, where the MacBook with the 5257U trounces the other two options. \n", "Q: How do transfer mp3 files to iPhone that is configured with iCloud Music Library I subscribe to the Apple Music service.  When I connect my phone to my iMac and open iTunes on the mac and go to the Phone and select Music settings I get \"iCloud Music Library is On\"  iPhone can access your iCloud Music Library.  Songs can be downloaded and played via WiFi or cellular network.\nThe issue: On my Mac I have a playlist of mp3 files and I would like to get that playlist of my3 files onto my phone. In iTunes on the mac beside each mp3 file there there is an iCloud icon with a line through it indicating that \"This item is not eligible for the iCloud Music Library\"\nSo now I'm stumped on how to get this particular mp3 files from my personal library on my phone.\n\nA: I ran into this myself, came across your question while seeking the answer, but have since figured it out.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204926\nThe key is to enable iCloud Music Library under Edit > Preferences > General in iTunes.  That then enables the \"Add to iCloud Music Library\" right click option over albums and individual files.\nItems you \"add to iCloud Music Library\" will then automatically appear in the Music app on your iOS devices.\n", "Q: 2006 macbook give me flashing folder with question mark without disk I am currently using a early 2006 macbook running on os x 10.5 and I am facing the flashing folder when turning it on. I have tried holding command & c and etc but nothing happens when I hold option after hearing the chime the arrow come up and i don't see no folder but it stays like this. I do not own any disks to put into my macbook because it was given to me. i do not want to take it to the shop because it will cost more than the laptop it self will cost. Is there any type of way to resolve this issue?\n\nA: The folder with question mark on start up means that the Mac is unable to locate your boot drive.\n\nMany possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Corrupted boot disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try Disk Utility using a boot via external unit (CD-ROM, external HDD, USB) to repair the disk. If you are unable to see the primary disk via Disk Utility follow the two possibility below.\n\n\n*HDD broken.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace your HDD and install a fresh copy of OS X or try to extract your data form the broken HDD and move it to the new one.\n\n\n*HDD SATA cable disconnected / broken.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your HDD is connected via SATA flat cable. Open your Mac, check this cable if it is disconnected or try to replace it.\n\n\n", "Q: OS X unknown ghost text expansion automatically! From yesterday, every time I type two characters \"p\" and \"i\" in serial, it will turn into \"ssh pi@10.210.100.45\", like this:\n\nAnd I have checked my system settings System Preferences → Keyboard → Text, it's empty, also unchecked the Correct spelling automatically.\nIt really confused me, imagine that each time I type \"ping some.domain\" or some words contains \"pi\".\nDoes somebody know how can I turn this feature off?\nAs @Alistair McMillan commented, I post the EtreCheck Result in gist.\n\nA: I think I've found the solution to your problem because I was experiencing something similar but with another string of text.  Are you using Dash?  It's an awesome tool but I didn't realise what it's snippet feature was doing.  If you have a snippet called \"pi\" then whenever that phrase is typed globally across your mac while ever Dash is running, it will substitute it with what is in your snippet.  See from the author's page here about a hint to put a ` on the end of snippets to avoid this accidentally occuring. \nhttps://kapeli.com/dash_guide#snippets\nHope this helps!\n\nA: One thing you could check is the Security & Privacy preference pane in System Preferences.\nIn OS X a lot of applications that hook into keyboard input use the accessibility protocol. They need to ask for permission to do this. If they have then they should be listed against Accessibility under the Security tab of the Accessibility pane.\n\n", "Q: What happens after a stolen Mac was remotely wiped? A Macbook Air was stolen from us last month and we immediately activated \"Find my Mac\" and a few minutes later we requested it to be wiped (through iCloud). Today, 1 month later, we received an email saying that the Mac had been wiped (but no location).\nMy question is: now what?\n\n\n*\n\n*is there any chance we get a location on the Mac? (i.e. is \"Find my Mac\" still active? even if OS X is reinstalled?)\n\n*is the Mac usable or is it locked by a pin code? Is it possible to reinstall OS X and use it?\n\n\nIn general, do thieves know what to do with stolen and locked Macs (is it easy to unlock them?), or is it now a brick?\nAlso the name of the Mac was changed to something generic: \"Macbook de mac\" (in english: mac's Macbook), which sounds like the thief might have been trying to sell the mac. Now that it has been wiped, could it be because somebody bought it and connected it to a wifi? If it's locked and un-usable, maybe there's a chance that they would bring it to an Apple Store and that we could get it back.\n\nA: Yeah u ain't getting it back! Once iCloud is turned off it can't trace like with a phone I factory reset it I don't add iCloud an that tracker the hole thing is factory reset. An that's what a thief would do reinstall it it's easy to get the firmware password. Were u insured? If so talk to Apple about them giving u another one.

I have way too many applications and sadly sometimes I forget if I have an application for a particular purpose.  So I thought I would like to organize /Applications into folders.  For example \"Audio, Video, Development, Design, etc.\"\nWhat will happen when an application updates from the app store?  Will it update the version that is in the folder or will it be downloaded to its original location in \"/Applications\"?\n\nA: Yes, you can move the applications. Providing the destination remains in the Spotlight index, the Mac App Store will continue to update the app.\n\nA: Rather than creating subfolders that change the directory structure in Finder, you might consider creating folders of related apps in Launchpad, using it as one does the iOS homescreen.\n", "Q: Video darker than photo on iPhone 5S I had this iPhone for one year but this is the first time I noticed this issue.\nThese are my specs: iPhone 5S 32GB - iOS 8.4 - ME435CS/A.\nThis is a photo made w/out flash: \n\nThis is a screenshot from a video: \n\nIs this even a bug or I'm missing something?\n\nA: While it may be true that the 5S has lower quality low-light video recording than other iPhones, there is a fundamental physics fact that you have to keep in mind: To get more light in a picture –controlling for other factors such as ISO and aperture– you need more time for each picture, more exposure.\nI just did a test on my iPhone 6, and the \"problem\" persists.\n\n\nThe thing is, it is impossible for an image to look brighter with less exposure.\nIn the case of my pictures, the first picture is taken at 1/15 of a second, with an ISO of 500.\nI can't find the ISO information on the video but I know the exposure: it has to be at the most 1/60 because I've setup video to have 60 frames per second. So it is 4 times faster -or 4 times less exposure- which explains the darkness.\nRemember a video is just a series of pictures.\nFrom the comments one of the links provided by Doc G.(emphasis mine):\n\nWhen taking a digital image, there are 3 main factors - aperture (or f-stop), shutter speed and ISO (sensitivity). In manual mode on a 'proper' camera you can experiment with all of these to achieve a desired result. In automatic mode, the camera makes all the decisions hoping to manage a decent (fast) shutter speed to combat camera shake or motion blur, a low value ISO to reduce noise, and an appropriate aperture to get the best exposure.\nUnfortunately, when shooting video one of these factors is set in stone. At 30fps your shutter speed will be set to 1/30th of a second, and at 120fps this will be 1/120th of a second. If you are talking about low light conditions, then you are required to open the aperture or increase the ISO to compensate. The iPhone 5s has an aperture of f/2.2, so that becomes another limiting factor. The only place left to go is an increase in ISO - meaning more noise.\nTherefore the iPhone 5s is either hitting it's (reported) ISO 2500 maximum, or deciding on a compromise value to avoid excessive noise. In other words, if there isn't enough light to be shooting video, you shouldn't be trying to shoot video. At least not until sensor technology improves, which will happen eventually.\n\n\nA: The substantial difference between the brightness of an iPhone 5s's low-light photographs versus the videos it creates under the same conditions is, as the annoying saying goes, a known issue.\nThis is my summary: \n\n\n*\n\n*The performance of the 5s is inferior to the 4, 5, and 5c models\n\n*It's apparently due to a unique combination of hardware and software\n\n*There's no expectation it will ever be resolved\n\n\nHere's a site where more information is available: http://www.imore.com/how-quality-your-iphone-5s-low-light-video\nIt includes several image comparisons of illumination levels substantially similar to yours, along with some replies from site visitors offering software workarounds: http://www.imore.com/how-quality-your-iphone-5s-low-light-video.\nHere's the issue on the Apple Discussion site: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24210873#24210873\n\nA: Here's your issue:\nWith video, frames must be captured with a minimum of 1/30s shutter rate (for 30fps video), and with photo, the minimum is 1/10s (for 10fps burst).\nBecause of that difference, iPhone can take a photo with a 1/15s shutter or anything faster than 1/10s, while for video frames, this shutter speed is 1/30s.\nSlower shutter speed means darker pictures.\niPhone also doesn't raise its ISO speed for low light too high, as that creates noticeable noise.\n\nA: This is not only problem with your device it is common.while you are switching to video mode scenes zooms a bit(which is due to video stablization)and less light is absorbed by sensor so video turns out to be little darker.\nsolution:you can use apps like movie pro and select stablization off and you can have videos as bright as your photos.\n\nA: There is no any problem in you phone just go to setting then general and then display accommodations turn off the auto brightness and then check the the video i think issue will be resolve as mine.\n", "Q: Can't change Dock size I can't change the Dock's size. I tried deleting the file com.apple.dock.plist from the Preferences folder but it didn't resolve the problem.\n\n\nA: After deleting the \"/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\" file you will need to reset the Dock for it to take effect. You can do this simply in a Terminal window with killall Dock.\nYou could also just try editing the plist file in a text editor. The tilesize parameter is the one that determines the dock size. It should look something like the following.\n<key>tilesize</key>\n<real>50</real>\n\nYou should also be able to resize the Dock by clicking on the dividing line between the application tiles and the file/folder tiles.\nIf resizing just doesn't work at all, there is a way to prevent changes to the Dock by making the size \"immutable\". If that has happened you can re-enable changes by entering the following commands in a Terminal window.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock size-immutable -bool false\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: Download onyx an fix all the issues on the Mac with that app should work.

Let us suppose I want to use a shared Apple ID for logging into iTunes & App Store, in order to share music and app purchases with a friend.\nBut let us also suppose that, despite this, my friend and I have very different tastes in music, so I don't want to share Apple Music playlists and \"like\" assertions with my friend. In other words, I don't want Apple Music to think I like the music my friend likes, and vice versa.\nIs there a way that my friend and I can share an Apple ID for logging into iTunes & App Store, but use different Apple IDs for Apple Music?\nI suspect the answer is no, but I just wanted to ask.\n\nA: UPDATE for follow-up question from OP\nYou can Authorize each other's computers on your Apple Account. There is a limit to doing this as you can only authorize 5 accounts on any one Apple ID.\nThen in iTunes on you computers, you can log into one account, download all of the apps associated with that account. \nThen log out, and log into the other Apple ID and repeat the download. This gets around the shared drive, but doubles the amount of data you need to store.\nWhen an app updates, you need to be logged into the account that \"purchased\" it for DRM reasons to update. If it is one of the apps on you account, then you can update on your iPhone through the App Store. Your friend will have to log into your Apple ID an update in iTunes, then sync their iPhone to iTunes.\nWhen an app updates on your friend's account, they can update however they want to, but you will need to go into iTunes, log on to their Apple ID and update that way, then sync your iPhone with iTunes. \nAs iPhone is pretty boxed in, I don't think it takes to kindly to switching back and forth between Apple ID's. I am not even sure if you can do that without it resetting the iPhone, and I am almost certain there isn't an option to have two Apple ID's logged into one iOS device at the same time.\nSo once you have done all that, you have probably violated 42 conditions in the TOS. Just don't let Taylor Swift find out.\n\nPrior Answer:\nThe short answer is yes, but it is a bit of a hassle. \nEach person can authorize the other's devices on your Apple ID, though there is a limit of five devices that can be authorized. So if you have computer, iPhone, iPad, IPod, then there isn't much room for your friend's devices. If you live in the same location, you can put the media on a shared drive and bring it into each others iTunes catalog. \nHere, the only catch is that the apps will only update for the person who bought the app, so you either need to have their Apple ID and password to log in as them to update on your devices, or with some maintenance on a regular basis, you can manually delete from your catalog and re add the updated app on your iTunes. I did this with my girlfriend long before Apple set up Family Sharing, which leads to...\nHow much do you trust this friend? You could set up a Family Sharing under iCloud that allows you to share everything, including media from iTunes and the App Store, plus photos, calendars, etc.\nThe catch is that the person who sets up the account is responsible for all of the purchases on that account. Only one credit card can be set up per family share, so basically if you set it up you pay. It is designed for a head of household situation with a spouse and three kids, so it is a little dicey if you don't trust your friend financially.\n\nA: The answer is Yes, but why go to all that effort of swapping back & forth between accounts.  \nIt would be far, far simpler to use an Apple ID each [as Apple intended] & set up Family Sharing - that's what it was designed for.  \nShared apps/music/books etc, yet separate 'tastes' in each & no cross-linked messages, email, texts or personal data.\n\nA: Yes you can use 2 diffrent itunes accounts easily. I have been doing that for years. As I travel alot I have 4 accounts due to limitations of each nation.\nThe switch is easy enough. Log out and log in, do your update and log out and back. Same goes for the purchases done between them.\nBut here is big problem each time you do that, the music app deletes your playlist. And I have put the playlist back. Each time. Thats big Hazzel and time consuming. Therefor I dont like apple music I hope in future that music app can have its own login.\n\nA: This is a really bad idea in my experience. I would recommend you make a family and share your Apple Music subscription (app purchases as well) so that you each can maintain your own playlists / mixes / play counts and such and only share the payment - not the actual data.\nYou’re able to choose different AppleID for each item that allows you to sign in so I think having each person maintain their own account (or possibly one work account and one personal account) would be best.\n", "Q: Why keyboard shortcut \"ctrl + left\" doesn't work?

I want to upgrade my OS X to Yosemite from Lion and also upgrade my HDD to a SSD but im worried about loosing my programs since I don't have the installers or serial keys. Specifically Adobe cs5 master collection and iWork. \n\nA: Usually the apps like PhotoShop just come across with all the right licenses.  However, sometimes you must contact the vendor if they have a draconian DRM policy where they are tied to a specific machine / OS.  \nI'd be very concerned with Adobe if it was a new machine but I've done the upgrade \"in place\" for Creative Suite at least twice on my MBP 2010.\nTo upgrade \"in place\" I just allow the installer to do its thing, and only keep Time Machine in the loop for catastrophes.

This is very odd and I just noticed this for the first time, but it seems, apple is not allowing ratings from customers for its own Postcast.app.\nThe entire section \"Ratings and reviews\" is absent for the podcast app:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/podcasts/id525463029\nOther apps do have ratings and reviews.

Apple does not allow ratings for it's own software or what? Can someone enlighten me about what's happening here?\n\n\n\nA: From what I have been able to gather, it looks like the Podcasts App and the iBooks app are the only apps made by Apple that don't have a ratings button. I am guessing since the Podcasts app (and iBooks) are automatically installed on your iPhone or iPad in iOS 8, and are also installable from the app store on earlier versions of iOS, they most likely just omitted it because you can't delete them in iOS 8.

It's currently in the cardboard box that it came in (not the big box from Amazon, a smaller box inside that). How can I store it for a month or so while keeping it happy and healthy until the time comes to give it the privilege of powering my computer?\n\nA: The recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15°C (59°F); the extreme allowable temperature is –40°C to 50°C (–40°C to 122°F) for most chemistries. While lead acid must always be kept at full-charge during storage, nickel- and lithium-based chemistries should be stored at around a 40 percent state-of-charge (SoC). This minimizes age-related capacity loss while keeping the battery operational and allowing for some self-discharge.\n", "Q: itunes 12.1 song into ringtone for iPhone I can't save segment of song as AAC in order to use as ringtone. Stuck at that stage. I am using iTunes 12.1.0.05. There seem to be solutions for earlier iTunes versions. I've edited song to be 30 seconds.\n\nA: As Eric says, you need the file to be converted to .aac & have the extension .m4r.\nIt also needs to be 40 seconds or less in length.\nOK, you could pay 50 bucks to do that - or you could do it for free.\nUse Audacity to cut to correct length & export as .aac\nThen drop the file onto MakeiPhoneRingtone to convert it for the phone.\nDrop the result onto iTunes & sync.\n\nA: If you have GarageBand ( on you iPhone will be best)\nYou can create a ringtone using the instruments and recoding features.\nOpen GarageBand. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the (+) symbol to open a new Song\n\n\n.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose your instrument or sample.\n\n*Play something you like while recording.

So today I went to buy something on the itunes store, but it said that I had to change my password since the account is pretty old. I did that, then tried to log in again, but it said my password was wrong. I kept entering it in and eventually my account got disabled. To disable it I have to enter security questions that I never set, and enter in my birthday, which apple constantly says is wrong. I click on the email option, but no email comes in to the recovery email that I set up. Please help!\n\nA: The only solution is to call Apple Support. Just go to the Apple ID support page and enter the information as it affects you. (I think going to \"Apple ID\" -> \"Disabled Apple ID\" would suit you best). I recommend calling telephone support, but you can also email them like suggested. Either way, it would be best to have a device connected to that ID.\n", "Q: Monitor ALL network traffic by app so far I used nettop and/or the activity monitor to observe the traffic used by each app but I noticed just now, that there is a huge difference between the sum of the per app traffic and the traffic which actually came through the network interface.\nIn this example the sum of the received traffic by app seems to be less than 5MB though the opened network interface monitor (right part of the screenshot) tells me, that actually 27.3MB came in. And this is the correct number as my mobile phone gives me the same figure for today's traffic.\n\nSo why is the sum of the traffic per app so much lower?\nRegards\nSimon\n\nA: In the screen shot you are showing the Network usage numbers are excatly the same 27.3 MB. \nThe individual network usage per application (coulomb) are current (active) numbers, which are much smaller and are not meant to be added manually to find out the total usage. OS X does that for you in the table at the bottom.\nThe Table at the bottom is showing the total usage for all applications and it is cumulative (for 7 days) or between restarts which ever comes first.\nI did the test:\nData Usage before restart.\n\nand Data usage AFTER restart:\n\n", "Q: How can I delete files in recovery mode using Terminal on my OS X main partition? I need to delete a folder otherwise my mac won't boot. How can I do this in recovery mode or whatever it's called using Terminal commands?\n\nA: Boot into recovery mode, mount volume, and open Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to recovery mode by holding CommandR right after starting your Mac before the Apple logo appears.\n\n*Go into Disk Utility and check that your target disk volume is mounted. Mount it if it's not already mounted. \n\n*Close Disk Utility, and open Terminal from Utilities menu.\nRemoving files from Terminal\nEnter cd /Volumes then ls to list all mounted volumes.\nEnter, e.g., cd Volume_Name/Users/<username>/path/to/parent_directory with parent_directory being the directory containing the target directory you want to delete.\nBe careful, as you have nothing restricting you from deleting required system files! Unless otherwise necessary, you should only delete files from your home directory (/Volumes/<Volume_Name>/Users/<username>/)\nExample: If you want to delete a folder \"xyz\" in \"Macintosh HD\" (the example name of your main volume) enter cd \"Macintosh HD/Users/username\", replacing username with your user name.\nThen enter ls again to list all files and directories to be sure that you are in the correct working directory.\nThen enter rm -r folder_to_delete or rm -rf folder_to_delete\n\n\n*\n\n*-r: Removes a folder and its content recursively.\n\n*-rf: Removes a folder and its content recursively, attempts to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file’s permissions, and ignore any errors.\n\n\nExample: If you want to delete a folder \"xyz\" and all containing files and folders enter: rm -r xyz\n", "Q: Why does my Macbook Air get so hot when playing even a simple game? Basically, even small games like Rogue Legacy, Battle World: Kronos, Magicka, Crusader Kings, etc. These are not graphic intensive games, yet the laptop reaches temperatures over 90 C. However, this doesn't happen with Hearthstone. So, out of curiosity, why does this happen? Will it happen with a current-gen iMac?\n\nA: Although the games may not be graphically intensive, they may still be intensive on the CPU, and it is likely the CPU temperature you are seeing rise. \nA way to check this would be to use Activity Monitor.app while playing a game to check out the CPU usage. Or if you are comfortable and able, SSH into the Mac while playing the game and using the top command to check. \n\nA: The CPU chip is the brain of the computer. \nExplained in most simple terms, it works with 1 and 0. Like the light switch on and off.\nIn order for it to create a single number or letter it needs 8 switches working together. \nIt does the switching millions of times per second, with millions of switches at the same time. The more it has to do the more switches are switching and faster.\nThe switching requires energy, thus the more it has to work the more energy it consumes. For example if you turn on the light switch once you do not feel like consuming any energy. Now try doing that in repeated motion (as fast as you can) for long time with both hands. You will feel the energy consumption, and eventually end up in sweet. Same with the CPU, except it switches millions of switches at the same time.\nThe CPU is also encapsulated in protective coating, like you wearing a winter coat, that would add to heating up. \nTo help CPU with staying cool, there is a big aluminum block on top of it. There is also a fan blowing air to cool it.\nBottom line the more the CPU has to do the more it will heat up.\nThe more powerful is the CPU the less it will heat up compared to its predecessor for the same task. A cruel comparison, if you were to force a CPU from 10 Years ago to play any of the \"Rogue Legacy, Battle World: Kronos, Magicka, Crusader Kings\" it would probably go red hot and melt.\nAs for the GPU (Graphics), same rules apply. In most Apple computers GPU function is a integrated part of the CPU chip, but some have a extra chip (called dual graphics) for more intensive graphics usage.\n", "Q: OS X Cmd+G starts searching for same text in different programs I've noticed the following behavior, but cannot find a reason or a bug report on why this may be happening. Maybe this is normal on OSX?\nThe situation:\nWith the terminal open, I search for some text, say \"hello\", which exists in the terminal. I get a few matches and Cmd+G even searches for more occurrences.\nI then switch to Chrome which has some web page open, and search for some text, say \"world\".\nHere is the kicker: when I switch back to the terminal and press Cmd+G, the terminal is now searching for \"world\" instead of the original \"hello\" I searched for in ther Terminal.\nIs there some option to fix this or is this a bug/designed behavior in OSX?\nVersion: OS X Yosemite 10.10.4\n\nA: It's a 'feature' - though its use in a Find dialog may have been almost accidental initially, it is actually an intentional usage.\nOS X, in common with several other flavours of unix, has two copy buffers.  \nThe one you know & love, cut/copy/paste itself on  Cmd ⌘   X ,  Cmd ⌘   C  &  Cmd ⌘   V \n& another, known as Kill & Yank, which can be called from  Ctrl ⌃   K  &  Ctrl ⌃   Y \nthough incidentally in Stack Exchange's markdown language,  Ctrl ⌃   K  will format as code instead. \nKill is the equivalent of Cut, rather than Copy, but Yank is equivalent to Paste.\nIt is actually this kill/yank buffer that most Find/replace dialogs use.\nThere is no way to avoid that, I'm afraid.\n", "Q: How many partitions should I make and what formatting schemes should be used on those partitions? I am thinking of buying a 2 TB WD My Passport Ultra External Hard drive and I'll be using it with both OS X and Windows. I am planning to use this drive for my Time Machine data backup after creating additional partitions in the external HD. I will also be storing a large number of files of Music, Videos, VMs(>4GB) and software setups.\nI know the limitations of Fat32 that it can't be used to copy files that are greater than 4 GB and of exFAT that it is prone to data corruption and chkdsk errors. I am confused on how many partitions should I make and what should be the formatting scheme on each partition? Also I want to know how much space should I leave on external HD for Time Machine Backup? I'll be backing up data only after a month or two, and my MacBook Pro has 256 GB SSD out of which around 220 GB is in use. \n\nA: According to this article you can get OS X to read and write to NTFS, so if you are planning on using the disk for both, then go with NTFS. The one thing you need to check is if Time Machine will write to NTFS. It writes to NAS's which are not using an Apple proprietary file system, so it may work okay, just check before you commit to it.\nAs for partitions, the way Time Machine works is that it lays down an initial backup and then does incremental backups so that you can do things like go back in history and recover an accidentally deleted file as well as restore a Mac completely. It gives you each backup point in the most recent month, then it makes one month archives back for as much space as you give it. It starts to delete old archives when it runs out of space. You could probably get by with a 500GB partition for you 250GB SSD. You may want to consider 750GB if the go back to previous versions option sounds important to you. If not, go with the smaller partition and then you can have more room on the other partition for media archiving.\nI am going to add a word of caution. In my personal experience, external USB HDD's are extremely unreliable. Almost every one that I have purchased, especially Western Digital Passports have bricked on me. I have lost data as I was doing the same thing you were doing and was extending my storage. I learned better.\nYour best bet if you have a router is to get a two disk NAS that you can set up via ethernet. Internal Drives, especially HGST tend to be far more reliable than their external cousins. Two disk NAS from Synology is reasonably priced, easy to set up, and will give you the added benefit of being able to set it up as a RAID, which provides an added level of protection in that if one drive goes bad, you can always swap in a new drive and have the RAID rebuilt. RAIDs are not fool-proof, so you want to make sure you have a back up of this as well. Here you can take a gamble with an external USB HDD as your data is on the more reliable NAS. \n", "Q: Is there an iPhone timer app that works with EarPods remote controls? I'm looking for a looping timer (e.g., 30 seconds - beep - 30 seconds - beep - ...) that can be stopped/resumed by pressing a remote control button on the EarPods.\nI'd like to use this app during weightlifting, where lifting time is variable and resting time should be uniform 30 seconds. After each beep, I would stop the timer using the remote control button, do weightlifting, then start the timer using the remote control button, and rest until the next beep.\nI had such an app on Android, but can't seem to find a similar one on iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.ohra.impetus\n\nA: No, applications are not allowed to catch presses on the headphones remote control and use it for something different than the designed feature - play/pause the playing song.\n", "Q: Uninstall PHP on Mac Mountain Lion I have installed PHP 5.4.40 on my Mac OS Mountain Lion, but need >=5.5.9 (for laravel/lumen-framework v5.1.0 installation), so i run installation with package installer, \niMac-Dmitry:Projects dmitry$ curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 5.6\n\nwhich is finished successful, but i still have: PHP 5.4.40,\niMac-Dmitry:Projects dmitry$ php -v\nPHP 5.4.40 (cli) (built: May  3 2015 22:07:42) \nCopyright (c) 1997-2014 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Zend Technologies\n\nI have no idea how to uninstall old version (i have no installed: yum, apt-get and brew), i don`t remember how i install previous version.\nSo, please, tell me - how i can uninstall old PHP version from my Mac, without installing additional software (cause it prefer to uninstall it, in the same case as it was installed).\nP.S.\nMaybe it was installed with the same package installer, but how to uninstall PHP with it? \n\nA: Don't uninstall the old php as it is /usr/bin and so supplied by Apple and so might affect the OS and Apple might reinstall it as part od an OS upgrade.\nThe binary install of php puts php in /usr/local/bin/php\nTo use it either use the full path or alter your PATH environment variable to have /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin\n", "Q: How to split screen in TotalTerminal to end up with two terminals? Often when you have ssh'ed into a server, you could like a second terminal to continue right off there, without having to ssh again.\nI know that iTerm2 can do it, but it feels buggy on multi screens.\nTotalTerminal makes a solid impression but seems to lack that feature, unless I have overlooked it.  Is there a way to split the terminal horizontally or vertically and have two independent terminals working off the same place?\n\nA: The way I achieve this is ensuring that tmux is installed on the machine I'm SSHing to.\nOnce you've issues tmux you can do ctrl-b % to split the screen vertically, or ctrl-b \" to split it horizontally. \nThis will give you two sessions within the same terminal window, and can also be persistent across logins. This may not be exactly what you want though. \n\nA: Mentioning TotalTerminal—which doesn't have a split-pane feature—may be too specific. You just want to know if there's a solution for Terminal, right?\nIt would help if you elaborated on what you mean by “continue right off there” and “without having to ssh again.”\nIf you create a terminal using Shell > New Remote Connection… or Shell > New Command… to run ssh, Terminal’s Shell > New Window/Tab with Same Command commands can create a new terminal and run the same command within it automatically.\n", "Q: MacBook Air Will Not Restart Yesterday, my 2013 MacBook Air powered down unexpectedly, and since then I have not been able to restart it.

I have a ton of music and I like to cycle through things I haven't heard in a long time.  I also like to listen to albums beginning to end primarily.\nHere is my latest setup\niTunes 12.2 on Windows 7\nIphone 5S,  IOS 8.4 \nI add music to my phone with a standard playlist \"iPhone playlist\".  I manually add and remove songs when I sync the phone to the computer.  In between syncs I'd like another smart playlist to only include the songs I haven't played yet.\nSo I attempt to do this:\nPlaylist is iPhone playlist\nLast played is not in the last 60 days\nlive updating is checked\nThis works on the PC, but the smart playlist is never updated on the phone once a song is playyed.\nAny advice?\nupdated:  I may not have explained it clearly.  Try this example:\n1- in iTunes, add new standard playlist called \"Temp\"\n2- add three songs to temp that haven't been played in a few months\n3- next add a new smart playlist called \"Temp not played\"\n4 - add this criteria to the \"Temp not played\" playlist\n     a-  playlist is temp\n     b - last played is not in last 30 days\n5-  both playlists should now contain three songs\n6-  sync these two new playlists to your phone and disconnect the phone from your computer\n7-  on the phone, listen to playlist \"Temp not played\"\n8 - when finished, does \"Temp not played\" still contain the three songs (even though you just played them)\nThat's what is not working for me.  \"Temp not played\" is never updated until I sync with the computer.  Other smart playlists work fine.  Say for example you created a list of no plays.  Once the song is played it disappears from the smart playlist immediately on the phone.\nI think the problem is when the criteria for a smart playlist contains the \"Playlist is xxx\" criteria.\nThanks\n\nA: I've run into the same problem and I too have narrowed it down to the \"playlist is xxx\" criteria.  Live updating works for every other criteria I have, but it doesn't like either a reference to alpha text or the reference to another playlist for some reason.  This seems to be a bug with iOS 8.4, because it worked fine for me before the update.  (I think it has more to do with the use of alpha text because I ran into the same problem when I tried to use \"category is\".)\nI have figured a work around.  Not the ideal solution, but it works for me.  \n\n\n*\n\n*I took a field I never use, in my case BPM, and cleared it out for all songs in my library.\n\n*In standard playlist XXX, I entered \"1\" in the BPM field for all the songs in that playlist only.  \n\n*Then in my smart playlist I add the criteria \"BPM is 1\".  \nThis works.  It draws only from songs in the standard playlist XXX, and live updating works as it should on the phone.\nThe only thing I have to remember is to clear the BPM field when I delete a song from standard playlist XXX.  \nHope that helps.  And I hope Apple fixes is this in their next update along with some other annoying smart playlist issues I've encountered.\n\nA: I think that the smart playlist aren't updated on the iDevice even if the content is synced between the computer and the iDevice.\n", "Q: Filter by column in Numbers I have blanks in each row.

I can only seem to play one song at a time, each with a new play click, or tediously create a playlist by adding each individual song to My Music, then creating a playlist.  Is there no way to stream search results in toto?\n\nA: In iTunes 12.3.1, you can play multiple songs from search results by playing one of the songs listed on the initial search results page -- the one divided into \"Top Results\" \"Songs\" \"Albums\" etc. iTunes will continue playing from your search results after the initial song.\nHowever, you cannot play multiple songs automatically from the detailed search results, e.g. if you click on \"Songs\" to see the all of the matching songs, and play one from there, it will stop playing at the end of the selected song.\n\nA: Answer: in iTunes 12.4 you will see a blue Filter button above any search results in the songs list (top one) and it reads [Filter Music for \"...\" (your search)]. Just click it and go play!\n", "Q: iMac 2008 vertical lines I have an issue with my iMac 2008 (8.1) (vertical lines). \nAnd I don't know where is the problem GPU/LCD. \nSomeone said I must buy mini DVI to test if the the screen is defective using a external screen?\nHow do I test if my LCD screen or GPU is defective.\n\nA: The other commenters are correct.

I am new to iCloud, and trying to figure out how to save my iPhone photos to my MacBookPro (Yosemite OS) for archiving purposes.  \nRight now, I am manually copying the photos from my \"photo stream\" events in iPhoto and pasting them into regular albums on iPhoto.  \nIs this enough to properly archive my photos onto my hard drive?  \nWhen I looked on the Apple website there were more complicated instructions for archiving, I'm hoping my low-tech solution is sufficient so my photos won't be deleted when the photos are deleted off of my iCloud photo stream.\n\nA: From Apple Support:\n\niPhoto automatically imports all photo stream photos into your library so you can keep them permanently (...)\n\nUnless you disable \"Automatic import\" from the options, there is no need to manually copying them as they already are in your library.\nAlso, adding them to iPhoto albums does not make additional copies of the pictures, just lets you arrange links to the originals in any fashion you like. In fact if you remove a photo from an album: \n\nThe photos are removed only from this album, not from other albums or events in your photo library.\n\nAnd neither from the library, for that matter.\nThis is because iPhoto albums work like labels, instead of being real folders (see an explanation here).\nSo to answer your question, enabling My Photo Stream on your iOS device and iPhoto, keeping auto import on, should suffice to have one copy of your pictures on your hard drive, given you regularly open iPhoto and have internet available for both (not necessarily concurrently ).\nNote that videos are not uploaded via My Photo Stream, and that you may run into trouble if you take more than 1000 pictures or let more than 30 days go between each iPhoto session.\nCheck Apple's FAQ on the details of this limitations.\nI would advise to implement some kind of backup anyway, as this scheme will at the most leave you with one —maybe two copies if you don't delete them from your iOS device.\nTime Machine is easy and free; for a dedicated picture/video solution check iCloud Photo Library (paid).\nThis information applies to the Photos app too at the moment of writing.\n", "Q: How to maximise the life of the Apple battery charger set (for Magic Mouse) batteries? I purchased a magic mouse battery charger set today. It had a battery charger and 6 batteries. Now I put 2 batteries into the magic mouse and 4 batteries are in the box. My question is how to maximise the life of these batteries??\n\n\n*\n\n*I use only one pair of batteries by charging / discharging and until the day the battery completely dies and no longer charges? (will that happen??) and then I switch to the next pair.\n\n*I use one pair and keep another pair in charging. Once this becomes completely drained, take the last pair from the box put it to charge, put the completely drained ones into the box and take the charged ones into the mouse. So i keep cycling like this?\nAny other suggestions? \n\nA: Lithium batteries do not like complete discharge, so do it at 10% or higher. You can leave them as long you wish in the charger, it will stop charging when full. \nThe battery charger it self has no limit on life time, yet again, it has to work harder if completely drained battery is to be charged.\nIf for some reason you have to leave the batteries on the shelf (in the box) for longer periods (months) then do it a 40% charge and keep them cool (15 Dgr. Celsius preferred).\nThen when you notice the ones currently in use are at 20% start charging the replacement (from the box).\n", "Q: External DVD reader suddenly not working anymore I have a Iomega SuperSlim USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive that I used without any issue on my Macbook Air.\nNow all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore.

What software have you updated since then? That could be the cause. For example if you went from OSX 10.10.3 to 10.10.4 and that is the only change there may have been a problem with the update.\nIn that case you may want to try re-applying the latest Combo Updater for your current OS version. If it was an app of some sort you may have to contact the manufacturer to see if they have had similar issues from other customers.\n\nA: Have you tried restarting into the recovery partition and then re-installing OS X?\n\nTo restart in recovery mode, shut down or restart your computer, and when it restarts hold down Command R. From there, select Re-install OS X, select your ssd, and  let it re-install. It will restart at least once during the process, and when it's done I think the dvd drive will stay mounted.\n\nIf that doesn't work, try opening a terminal window (while the dvd drive is plugged in) and typing diskutil list. It should say something list your ssd as disk0, but it should also list the cd as disk1s1 or disk2s1. If it does, that tells you that your computer is able to keep the dvd drive mounted.\nAnd if that doesn't work, your dvd drive may have a problem or is nearing the end of it's life span. Not staying mounted is one of the things that happens when they have problems or are dying \n", "Q: Problem setting up Outlook 2011/2016 with Google-apps email I have an email address managed Google Apps (it uses the imap.googlemail.com and smtp.googlemail.com servers, but the part after the @ is not gmail but the domain of my university).

Sometimes it requires a little fiddling to find the right security protocol / port combination, but the above worked for me on my university issued email, which is hosted with Google Apps.\nAlso, triple check your email address, as the error shown implies an authentication problem and I've banged my head on the keyboard trying to figure out what was wrong many many times, only to discover a typo was the culprit.\nThis are the recommended settings for any IMAP client from Google, which differ from what you described (on the servers).\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server - Requires SSL\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*imap.gmail.com\n  \n*Port: 993\n  \n*Requires SSL:Yes\n  \n  \n*Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - Requires TLS\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*smtp.gmail.com\n  \n*Port: 465 or 587\n  \n*Requires SSL: Yes\n  \n*Requires authentication: Yes\n  \n*Use same settings as incoming mail server\n  \n  \n*Full Name or Display Name: [your name]\n  \n*Account Name or User Name: your full Gmail address (username@gmail.com).

The settings, setup process, and help files on Google are straightforward and nicely done (as shown in the above answers also, including the \"allow less secure apps\" instructions and process for Outlook).  None of it works for me and I finally reached out to the support staff for the pipeline email department at the university and they told me that they do not have imap or pop servers setup so I cannot use Outlook and I have to use the web interface.

Surely there is a simpler way.\nbtw: What is the setting to stop \"Photo\" from launching every time I plug-in my iPhone?\n\nA: From your comment, I will ignore the \"accepted\" methods, such as Photo Stream.\nYour question is still somewhat generic, as \"quickest\" can mean different things to different people in different situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are physically near your Mac, AirDrop. Here is an apple support document explaining the procedure.\n\n*With a USB cable, connect your iphone to your Mac and open the Image Capture application. Depending on your settings and OS versions, you may need to grant permission on the device. You can select one or many photos, and choose import, or just drag them into a folder. There is an option to delete them from the phone after transfer as well.\n\n*Without a USB cable, your method is actually what I would recommend, although with a twist. I attach the images to an email, then save it as a draft, retrieve the emails from the draft on my Mac, then delete the draft. This has the added benefit of not creating a copy of the email in your sent folder. It seems like this might be important to you as your concern with standard sharing methods is unknown \"leakage.\"\n", "Q: Disk space not freed after deleting files, unable to save things, unable to delete things, unable to update things Recently my Macbook Air has been saying \"The disk you are attempting to use is full. Removing files and emptying the Trash will free up additional space.\" \nI have deleted everything in the trash, many other files, and 52 GB of photos. The only photos I have in my library now are 4.53 GB worth. When I click go to About This Mac it says I have 46 GB which is impossible. My computer is supposed to have a 121 GB Flash Storage with a 4 GB memory. \nIn the past two days after deleting all my photos the computer isn't letting me save, delete, or update anything. Right now I have OS X 10.9.5. \nWhat can I do to fix this problem?\n\nA: If you've \"upgraded\" to the Photo app from iPhoto or Aperture, your photos would have been imported as hard links. Basically this means that each photo is represented by both programmes and deleting from just one has no effect on the actual photo file. You'd need to delete from both.\nCheck to see if you have another album in your Pictures folder (or other folder if you manually placed it somewhere else) and delete the photos (hard links) there.\n\nA: Also if you start the Mac in Safe Mode (boot with the shift key held down) it does a lot of disk checking/repairs including (I believe) repairing permissions. So that might be a quick and easy way to see if the Mac can repair itself.\n\nA: This seems more like a file permissions problem than a photo problem. Try restoring file permissions for that disk from the Disk Utility.\n", "Q: How to Add All Songs of Apple Music Playlist to My Music at Once? When browsing through Apple Music, there are curated Apple Music Playlists.\nNow, I can add each song of the Apple Music Playlist to \"My Music\" by right clicking and selecting \"Add to my Music\". That's very inconvenient, when I want to add all songs of that playlist to \"My Music\". \nIs there any easier way? Any one-click solution?\n\nA: Yes you can, on both iTunes and your Apple device. You didn't mention which device specifically, but on iTunes, look for the + icon or the ..., which you can click and Add to My Music as well.\nCheck out these screenshots below on iTunes. I boxed the + icon on both pictures because that is the simpler approach, but you can also click the ...:\n\n\n\nA: I finally found the solution.\nHere are the steps to force iTunes to add all songs of an Apple Music Playlist to your local iTunes “My Music” library:\n\n*\n\n*Add the Apple Music Playlist to your library by clicking on the + icon on the upper right.\n\n*Go to the Playlists tab and select the recently added Apple Music Playlist. Now select all tracks and right click on any of them to select “New Playlist from Selection”.\n\n*After iTunes has created a new playlist, go back to the original one to select all tracks again and drag them over to your new playlists. Skip adding duplicates.\n\n*You’re done - now all these tracks should be added to your local iTunes “My Music” libray and you can safely delete both playlists!\n\nEasier option (from iMac):\n\n*\n\n*Add the Apple Music Playlist to your library by clicking on the + icon on the upper right.\n\n*Now that this new playlist appears in your left tab with all your playlists, drag it to your other playlist\n\n\nA: 2021, iTunes got replaced by Music.\n\n*\n\n*Add playlist any way you do it (I migrated from another streaming platform)\n\n*Open Music and go to this playlist. Make sure it's open in Music - songs get 100% of playlist window\n\n*Command + A -> Add to Library\n\nA: The + sign is no longer in apple music on playlists I have created. I found a different solution on my own by opening Apple Music on my laptop, clicking file in the top left corner, clicking Add to library, then selecting my Music Folder on the side bar, then clicking the desired playlist, and finally, selecting all the songs in the playlist and clicking Open. To get the same thing to happen on your phone, follow these steps while your phone is connected to your computer through USB. Then (on your computer), go to recently added on your apple music library sidebar, and highlight every album. Right click one of the albums and click \"add to my music\". Your playlist should be successfully imported into your library!\n", "Q: Cannot initiate Windows 7 install on MacBook Air bootcamp I use the latest Yosemite version on MacBook Air, I am trying to install Windows 7...\nI start bootcamp, I select the first two checkboxes\n[X] create windows 7 install disk\n[X] download support software\n[  ] remove windows 7 or later version\nThe windows partition already exists from previous similar attempts.\nAsks me for path to Windows 7 ISO and the USB stick to use.\nAfter I wait a few hours to setup the stick, it tells me that it installed the support software and that I should use this software after I install windows.\nThe only button now is [QUIT]. I press quit and it exists, it never starts the windows 7 install as I expect.\nIf I reboot and hold option button pressed, the \"windows\" stick doesn't start, it complains about missing bootable disk or something similar.\nWhat am I doing wrong ? This newly created Win7 USB stick works to boot on other PCs, I tried it.\n\nA: I got it sorted, it was probably my fault not understanding the options properly.\nThe actual install can only be started by that last option that says eider:\nremove windows 7 or later version\nOR\ninstall windows 7 or later version\nSo if you already have a Windows partition created you will see remove windows 7 or later version, you need to remove it and then it will change into install windows 7 or later version, after creating the partition again, it will restart and the install will begin.\nIf you already have the bootable stick previously created by these steps, just plug it without checking first two boxes (create boot stick, download support software), creating that stick would take hours.\nI think Apple could make it more clear (the re-install part).\n", "Q: Allen Heath QU-16 mixer to Macbook Pro connect We need to hook up a macbook pro to record our sermons through GarageBand to an Allen Heath QU-16.  The macbook pro only has one headphone jack. \n\nA: Use the USB B from the mixer to you Mac, and select the Qu as the input device in yoursound preference panel. Simple, and great quality. Use 48k sample rate.\n\nA: The single headphone jack is a 3-pole connection, allowing for you to use, for example, a headset with a microphone to allow both audio in and out of the connector.  Obviously, this is in MONO for incoming, which may not be suitable for all recordings, but might well be fine for sermons.  You'll need to get a hold of a suitable adapter/splitter (This is one example, I just googled for headset microphone splitter , and then plug your microphone into the appropriate bit.  Alternatively, you could just pick up a USB microphone.\n", "Q: Can I daisy chain Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 to FireWire 400 If I had a FireWire 400 DVD drive connected (via a FireWire 400-800 cable) to a FireWire 800 hard drive that was then connected via a Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 adapter to a Thunderbolt hard drive, that was then connected to a Mac, would I be able to use all the drives?\nAnd would I get Thunderbolt speeds on the Thunderbolt drive and FireWire 800 speeds on the FireWire drive? \nAlso all the drives are powered externally.\n\nA: Your setup will not work. You must have separate FireWire and Thunderbolt chains, and not connect devices to both interfaces simultaneously.\n\nA: Updated Answer:\nOkay, It just dawned on me I have the hardware here to test daisy-chaining two FireWire devices at the end of the Thunderbolt daisy-chain and it did work.  I have access to all devices in the chain, both Thunderbolt and FireWire.  I could not test with FireWire devices in the middle of the chain as I'm short a cable/adapter for an in the middle configuration.  However Apple has stated in the past the non-Thunderbold devices had to be at the end of the chain.\nAs to the throughput speed of the FireWire devices they cannot exceed what they're rated regardless of how connected.\n", "Q: How do I view the transaction list for my debit card on Apple Pay? I just got the iPhone 6 and I started using Apple Pay. I added my Bank of America debit card and an American Express credit card. Now whenever I use my Amex one, I get a notification as soon as I use it, and my last transaction is showing with the amount and the location, and I could also open a list to show the most recent transactions. My debit card doesn't do that at all. No notifications, no dollar amount, just says \"Dallas, TX --\" and doesn't put the dollar amount. I went into settings and into my BofA card and there's not even a \"Card Notifications\" slider so I can turn it on. Is there any way to bypass or fix this?\n\nA: BoA does have the mobile banking app.\n\nMobile Banking Alerts\nStay on top of your accounts\nAlertsFootnote 1 are customizable and can keep you informed of just\n  about everything that happens with your account. Stay in the know\n  about direct deposits, personal information changes, bill due dates\n  and more. Even find out when your account balance gets low so you can\n  make a deposit to help avoid overdraft charges and other fees.\nInformation Icon Alerts are available exclusively in our iPhone, iPad\n  and Android Apps.\n\n\nA: This is possible on iOS 9 by using the Wallet app to inspect the card in question for banks that support the history being saved. \nTap the ⓘ and then look at the TRANSACTIONS section that's under the Card Notifications toggle.\nFor transactions that are from other Apple Pay devices (watch perhaps) and for transactions older than is displayed, you'll need to use your bank's mobile app, mobile web site or other account history / statements to retrieve those transactions. Worst case, you would reach out to your bank to see if/when they will support this feature on iOS.\n", "Q: Shell script to rsync or if not mounted - mount and rsync This is what I've got so far:\n!/bin/sh\nStorage Folder Backup\nDefines mount point\nLOCALMOUNTPOINT=\"/Volumes/thisisanetworkshare\"\n\nChecks for mount\nif mount | grep \"on $LOCALMOUNTPOINT\" > /dev/null; then\n\nIf already mounted initiates rsync job\ncaffeinate -i rsync -av /Users/auser/storage/ /Volumes/thisisanetworkshare/ --log-file=/Users/auser/rsync.log\n\nOtherwise mounts and initiates rsync job\nelse\n    mkdir thisisanetworkshare\n    mount_smbfs //thisnetwork/thisisanetworkshare /Volumes/thisisanetworkshare\n    caffeinate -i rsync -av /Users/auser/storage/\n    /Volumes/thisisanetworkshare/ --log-file=/Users/auser/rsync.log\nfi\n\nSo basically I want to start an rsync if the network share is already mounted but if it's not then I would like to mount that network share and start an rsync.\nThe network share requires auth but this is saved in the keychain so doesn't ask for it in finder. Does this matter for a shell script?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Using the proper normal syntax of the command line version of the mount command from the command line or a bash script for a password protected SMB Share will require entering the password, by one means or another. However from a bash script or command line there is a way to access the stored Keychain password to mount the SMB Share without entering the password in the bash script or from the command line.\nThe following assumes both the authenticating User Name and Password for the target SMB Share is stored in the User's Keychain.\nSince the authenticating User Name and Password for the target SMB Share is stored in the User's Keychain then mounting the target SMB Share can be done via AppleScript within the bash script or command line using the osascript command.\nIn the following example I shared the Temp folder on another system on my Network having the IP Address: 192.168.169.227\nI first mounted this via Finder's Go menu > Connect to Server... where I checked the \"Remember this password in my keychain\" check box so it's stored in the Keychain.  Once that was done I unmounted the share and used the following command to mount it from a bash script.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to mount volume \"smb://192.168.169.227/Temp\"'\n\nI did not need to pre-create the \"/Volumes/Temp\" folder as that is done automatically by this method unlike using the mount -t smbfs //... command normally where the mount point supplied has to already exist.\nSo as you write your bash script use this method in place of the normal command line version of the mount command.\n", "Q: How to delete an album in the Photos app?

Is there anyway to hide the title bar aside from fullscreen mode?\n\n\nA: I think the short answer is no.\nTinkerTool is one of the best utilities out there for modifying the way your system appears/behaves. They do not have any options to remove the title bars from applications in general, although there is one setting to hide the title bar of windows in Quicktime X Player.\nThe longer answer would be for open-source applications you could potentially modify the code generating the UI.\n", "Q: Send mail from OS X without email account On linux, I use exim4 to send mail to a public email address. I don't have to authenticate or anything. It pretends its noreply@example.com and sends it to someone@example.com.  Is it possible to do the same on OS X?\nI have a cron job, and I want to send mail from the root user as noreply@example.com like with my linux box. I looked up postfix configuration as it seems to be the method used, but all the examples require authentication. Is there anyway to avoid this? \n\nA: Yes, there's no problem in sending emails like that from OS X. \nFirst, you'll need to configure postfix to relay emails. Once you've done that, you'll need to create the script that sends the email. I'm not sure what method you're using to send email on the Linux system, but something very similar should work on OS X, for example, using mailx.\nAssuming that your upstream mail provider (the system your OS X system is relaying mail through, ie the mail relay) doesn't require authentication, you won't need to configure mail authentication.\n", "Q: Apple Music & Apple TV As far as I can see Apple TV does not support Apple Music (see Apple Music)\n\nDid I miss something?\n\nA: Apple Music will launch on iOS, Mac, and Windows on June 30, coming to Apple TV and Android phones this fall.

I've just received a router with my new internet access. This router is wireless only and therefore has no ports except for power.\nHow can I connect my Time Capsule to this router now that I can no longer connect it directly through a network cable?\nUsing the AirPort Utility, I've tried to choose the Wireless Network Mode: Extend a wireless network. Even though I provided the correct settings for the existing wireless network my Time Capsule doesn't extend it and there's no wireless connection to my wireless router. It just keeps blinking orange...\n\nA: I'm afraid you can't.\nExtending networks only works between Apple products and the Time Capsule does not have a \"client mode\", as the Airport Express. You could buy a router that can connect wirelessly to your ISP Modem - Router, and connect the TC by an ethernet cable to it, in order to keep using it as a Time Machine destination. You would have to put the TC in bridge mode. An Airport Express will be able to fulfill this role.\n\nA: I've got a Time Capsule (AirPort Time Capsule 802.11ac, Model Number: A1470) and had the same problem. Additionally, I also wanted to continue to have automatic Time Machine backups using wireless networking.\nHere's my solution if Jaime Santa Cruz's answer doesn't help you.\nMy Problem\nI live in an apartment which includes and provides Internet access only through a wireless access point which isn't under my control. (So, there's no WAN Ethernet cable to connect my Time Capsule to).\nI don't have any other Apple wireless devices like an Airport Express. (So the Time Capsule's and Apple's proprietary \"Extend a wireless network\" feature cannot be used).\nI want a simple, inexpensive solution. (So buying an extra wireless router or a Raspberry PI isn't something I want to do).\nSolution idea\n\"Replace the Time Capsule's WAN Ethernet cable with a wireless bridge or WiFi Bridge\".\nMy solution\nI found this wireless bridge which I successfully hooked up to my Time Capsule: Vonets VAP11N-300 Wireless Mini WiFi Bridge/Repeater.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis solution is simple and inexpensive. Time Machine backups from my notebook to the Time Capsule work using the apartment's existing wireless network.\nNo additional power supply is needed as this wireless bridge can be powered through the Time Capsule's USB port.\nThe wireless bridge requires a few configuration steps but it's doable.\nUsing this wireless bridge the Time Capsule is now available on my apartment's wireless network which isn't under my control. (The Time Capsule's wireless access point functionality is turned off).\nAlternatively, this solution would also allow to use the Time Capsule as the (private) wireless access point for my apartment and having all devices connect to it (\"better security\") instead of using the apartment's wireless network. As such the apartment's wireless network would then only provide the (wireless) Internet connection to my Time Capsule and nothing else.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina screen jerking I have a brand new Macbook Pro Retina, MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E46). Every now and then the whole display jerks briefly down and then back up again in place. I haven't found any reference to this online. Any idea why this might be happening?\n\nA: Based on my experience with Macbooks, I suspect there is either a loose connector, or (sigh) you have a dying chip on the motherboard (probably video controller).  Genius Bar should be able to diagnose for you pretty quickly.\n", "Q: Siri on my Apple Watch doesn't stop listening when I stop talking. Why? I've had my Apple Watch for about a week and I use Siri constantly. For the first few days it worked like a dream: I'd raise my wrist, talk, and Siri would do what I asked. For the past few days, however, it sits there still listening after I finish talking. It'll remain in this state for upwards of 30 seconds - long enough that I have to tap the screen to stop it going to sleep and losing what I'd said - before finally deciding I have stopped speaking, and successfully doing what I'd asked.\nIt's not background noise that's causing this: I'm using it in the same environment that I'd used it in before, and it works perfectly on my phone.\n\nA: Switch-it-off-and-on-again FTW!\nWhilst typing the above question, I thought maybe I ought to at least try switching it off and on again, so I did: I held both buttons in for a few seconds to force a restart, and after that I found it worked perfectly again.\nHope this helps someone else!\n", "Q: Can't use machine name to login using SSH anymore on Yosemite, how to fix? from yesterday I have noticed that I can't connect via SSH to my OS X's SSH server anymore using the following command:\nUser-MBP:~ user$ ssh user@user-mbp\nuser is the user on the server, user-mbp is the name of my machine, as specified here in System Preferences > Sharing:\n\nI have the following written under Remote Login: On:\n\nTo log in to this computer remotely, type \"user@user-mbp\".\n\nBut user-mbp seems to be unreachable, even ping doens't respond:\nUser-MBP:~ user$ ping user-mbp\nping: cannot resolve user-mbp: Unknown host\n\nIt is strange because I was able to connect typing user-mbp before, I remember. Also OS X is telling me to use that hostname for the SSH connection in System Preferences > Sharing, as I told.\nI thought maybe something messed up the DNSResolver, even if I didn't touch anything, so I tried the following commands taken from the post DNS not resolving on Mac OS X:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\nBut they didn't help, so I am writing this post.

The DNS-server in your router (usually a DNS caching only server) as well as the DNS-servers of your ISP and the superior root servers know nothing about your local network and namespace.\nTo temporarily fix this (check man dns-sd) the following - executed on user-mbp - should work:\ndns-sd -R user-mbp _ssh._tcp. local 22\n\nYou may even propagate a user and a password (I didn't test that and i don't know how that should work or how secure it is):\ndns-sd -R user-mbp _ssh._tcp. local 22 u=<username> p=<password>\n\nTo permanently fix this, first update to 10.10.4 with the Combo Updater, check the search domain settings of your router's DHCP-server, delete all caches (e.g. with Onyx or Yosemite Cache Cleaner), use a *.local name (e.g. user-mbp.local instead of user-mbp) where appropriate (e.g. Sharing Prefs, shell), don't use \"local\" as search domain in your network prefs and then repair your Bonjour service with several answers provided here at stackexchange or if nothing helps alternatively set-up dnsmasq.\n\nP.S. You should always use the full Bonjour-name (e.g. user-mbp.local) to address a local host/device using dns-sd. The reason to do so is the following:\nA lot of routers provide a search domain for easier configuration if on-board DHCP is enabled or propagate an ISP connection specific domain name. Examples: The default search domain of my Fritz!Box is \"fritz.box\", the default search domain for some DLink routers seems to be \"local\".\nIf your Mac uses DHCP to assign an IP, the default search domain will be applied also. In my case pinging \"myothermac\" automatically appends \".fritz.box\" and the host myothermac.fritz.box will be probed. If you don't have a DNS-server in your local network with a primary zone \"fritz.box.\" containing a host with the name \"myothermac\", the command ping myothermac will fail. Unlike to ping myothermac.local, which should work if Bonjour is set-up properly.  \nSince most routers aren't Bonjour-aware, change any default search domain settings containing \"*.local\" or \"local\" or apparently some DLink routers with an empty search domain to something else like \"happy.home\" to avoid any conflicts with the Bonjour service.\n\nA: Append .local to your machine name.\nIf that works, and you don't want to have to do that, in System Preferences > Network > (Interface) > Advanced > DNS > Search Domains, add \".local\".\n", "Q: My mac laptop randomly plays music and won't stop My mac randomly plays my iTunes music while I'm watching a movie or just using my laptop.

This makes a total of 350 screenshots for iTunes Connect, just for one app.\nMy question is: there's there a simpler solution, less tedious than having to edit each screen in each size in Photoshop?\nThank You\n\nA: There are solutions to automating editing and generation of App Store screenshots. Whether you find them 'simpler' depends a bit on what tools you're comfortable using:\nEditing existing screenshots?\nIf you're adding frames and title texts, you can automate this with FrameIt (if you are comfortable working in the command line).\nOther generic image editing problems: Use Adobe Photoshop and make friends with the Actions palette.\nGenerating new screenshots?\nAutomate generating new screenshots across devices and languages with Snapshot, this relies on learning a bit of the Instruments app and specifically UI Automation, and some command line fiddling.\nIf I were to recommend, I would work through automating generating new screenshots rather than fiddle with editing existing screenshots. This might have a harder learning curve, but once done you should save a lot of time when preparing screenshots for future versions of the app.\nSnapshot and FrameIt are both part of Fastlane toolset for automating the App Store submission process.\n\nA: Take a look at this app in the Mac App store: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prepo/id476533227?mt=12\n\nI'm not sure this does exactly what you need, but it's a free app for most features and may be worth a try.\n", "Q: Buying US iTunes card from UK I have a US iTunes account and a friend - also from the US but currently in the UK - wants to send me an iTunes gift card. \nMy question is: can he buy this card valid for the US Store with his US credit card but from his UK location.

You don’t have to be in the same country as your account is for.\nYou just can’t use an American dollar voucher on an English account as they use pounds.\n\nA: No UK cards are valid for UK accounts, it won't work on US account.

The purpose of this drive is to hold an iTunes library (sharing to AppleTV) and a couple of directories to share to other Macs around the house.\nI’ve previously used one “fileshare” user to share everything around, but would like to have some segregation between the folders being shared to other Macs such that “my” stuff is private to me, and I can’t readily see what other people have on their shares.\nI thought this would be easy, but preliminary investigations suggest not—both of my current users seem to think they own the directories.\nAs my “admin” user, I do a ls on the JBOD and get the following:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwx------  20 admin  staff  680  1 Jun 15:07 Ben\ndrwx------  13 admin  staff  442  8 Mar 20:31 Faye\ndrwx------  12 admin  staff  408  8 Mar 20:32 Misc Videos\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 admin  staff  238 10 Apr 11:34 iTunes\n\nAs my “fileshare” user, I do the same:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwx------  20 fileshare  staff  680 Jun  1 15:07 Ben\ndrwx------  13 fileshare  staff  442 Mar  8 20:31 Faye\ndrwx------  12 fileshare  staff  408 Mar  8 20:32 Misc Videos\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 fileshare  staff  238 Apr 10 11:34 iTunes\n\nLooking in the Finder “Get Info” details, each user believes that the various directories belong to them and that “everyone” else has “No Access”.\nWhen looking in the Sharing Preferences, each user believes they are sharing the directories:\n\n\n\nSystem Stats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: Mac Pro, mid-2009\n\n*OS: Mavericks, 10.9.5 (regular client OS X, no Server installed)\n\n*JBOD: Hornettek Enterprise 4X II Quad-bay 20 TB Capacity\n\n*USB 3 card: Inateck 4 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card for Mac Pro\n\n\nThe reason I’m “stuck” on Mavericks is that the USB 3 card causes kernel panics on Yosemite.\n\nI know that usually for removable drives you want everyone to access everything, because you might remove the drive and put it into another computer where an owner can't be found, but in this case the JBOD is (to me) seen as an “internal” disk. (As an aside, my internal drive bays are full, hence buying the JBOD)\nHow can I set permissions on this file system such that only one user owns them and only that user can share them?\nDo I need to, in some way, tell OS X to treat this like an internal drive? How might I achieve this?\n\nA: Most of the problems I seem to have with this kind of thing come from the ACL rather than the basic permissions.\nUsually what I end up doing to fix the problem is to format another drive to get the default permissions and ACLs then use these commands to copy them to my old drive:\nchown $(stat -f%u:%g \"$srcdir\") \"$dstdir\" # Copy owner and group\nchmod $(stat -f%Mp%Lp \"$srcdir\") \"$dstdir\" # Copy the mode bits\n(ls -lde \"$srcdir\"  | tail +2 | sed 's/^ [0-9]*: //'; echo) | chmod -E  \"$dstdir\" # Copy the ACL\n\nIt's possible to use the \"Get Info\" dialog to apply the changes to all the enclosed items and then start from scratch with setting up the permissions again, this normally fixes things for me.\n(Either that or it's the \"ownership permissions\" toggle in the \"Get Info\" dialog for the drive.)\n", "Q: iPad mini 3 bought from United States I bought a brand new iPad mini 3 64GB from a auction site, I knew it was imported from the US, that's fine, I'm now unsure as to what SIM card I can use in it, it won't accept an O2 SIM card.\nCan I use it in the UK on cellular, if so what network SIM card might I have to get.\n\nA: No iPads have ever been network locked and all current model iPads with cellular connectivity support both CDMA and GSM networks (see Apple's LTE information), with no frequency limitations.\nWhat that means is that your US-purchased iPad Mini should work just fine with an O2 data SIM (and any other UK data SIM for that matter - EE, Vodafone or Three).

The hard drive also appears to be in good condition.\nInitially, I thought this was due to a battery failure and removed the battery. Despite this, the battery was fine (not warped or bulging). I noticed that the two bulges in the case appear over where the hard drive is in a MacBook Pro.\nThere is also a \"semi circular\" bulge near these two lines.\nWhat could be causing these if it is not the battery? Also, is there any chance that these bulges could expand? \nEdit: After further inspection it appears to have occurred exactly over the bridge that holds the hard drive in place. (the long black piece with the two screws in it). \nI have added a picture. Sorry, they are really hard to see.\n\nNote: The two lines look like shadows and are somewhat difficult to see in (any) photo.\nEdit: more photos\n\nThe second image (below) shows what is under the bulge. Maybe something looks out of place?\n\n\nA: This is the result of excess force squeezing the wrist pad against the internal components.\nIn your other question asking about heat stress is a no go. Aluminum doesn't weaken or deform that way in temperature ranges where plastic won't melt and batteries don't catch fire. The bulge in the other question is really compression bending the case inward and components sticking up. Think aluminum foil placed over one large ridged potato chip - press lightly with a finger and you will see the ridges below the foil.\nWhy not upload a picture if you have an example, or is this a hypothetical case?\n\nA: I doubt that the Mac would get so hot internally that the metal would warp before the Mac shut itself down. There are thermal sensors throughout the unit designed to keep it from thermal overload.\nDid this actually happen to you? How is it warped?\n", "Q: MBP 15\" early 2011 shuts down after login without power cord Update #1:\n\nI uninstalled gfxcardstatus.

I have a school issued MacBook Air with several apps installed. While they were downloaded from the App Store using my personal Apple ID, I need an administrator password, which I don't have, in order to delete them. Is there a way to do this without adding another account?\n\nA: No, but you can revoke the computer from your AppleID account.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible without bypassing the security systems (which i do not suggest doing.) I'm assuming that you really need these apps to be gone (like having disabled xcode command line tools), so I recommend you put together a good argument for your school's tech helpdesk to uninstall them for you, something along the lines of 'I was an idiot when I installed these, please help'.\nIf for whatever reason you don't want to do that, there are several good ways to soft-brick your computer to the point that it will need a complete reimage. This is very mean to your school's IT people, but if you back up your files and then get them to reinstall OSX on your computer, that will certainly get rid of the apps, hopefully without too much suspicion.\nThis is more of a psychological solution than a tech-based one, but I hope it helps!\n\nA: you can by putting it in the trash and then emptying your trash!\nhttps://superuser.com?             it will show you\n\nA: I don't really have a way that you can delete the apps without the admin password but i have two ways you can change the admin password meaning that you can then delete the apps.

I changed the Fn key on my Macbook Pro to actually work in the reverse way (so, just hitting the F1 key actually sends the \"Function 1\" signal, rather than the brightness decrease signal when the Fn key is not pressed, and the brightness decrease signal if the Fn key is pressed). I did this because, as a developer, it's much more useful to me to be able to utilize the function keys than the other (what I consider auxiliary) functions.\nHowever, when I'm at home, I use an external keyboard (a Logitech K811). It's a great keyboard, but it doesn't seem to sense the preference change I made with the Fn key. That is, on my macbook keyboard, I don't have to hold Fn to activate the function keys, but on my Logitech keyboard, I do.\nIs there a way to make the Logitech keyboard also act the way I have it setup in my System Preferences? \n\nA: According to Logitech you need they Preferences Manger download and installed.\nMake sure you pick the right OS X and follow the instructions.\n\nA: In 2019 Logitech utillity to redefine Fn keys is called SetPoint.

As coded it's going to make 3 five second recordings on your Desktop named \"Recording_n.m4a\" when 'n' in the name will be incremented automatically 1 to 3, e.g. \"Recording_1.m4a\", \"Recording_2.m4a\" etc. to whatever howMany is set to.\nOpen Script Editor and copy and paste the code below and press the \"Compile\" button.\nset howMany to 3 -- The number of recordings to make.\n\nset recordingNumber to 1 -- 'recordingNumber' is used to increment the recording number in the filename when exporting.\n\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    activate\n    close (every document whose name contains \"Untitled\") saving no -- I set this just to have no other Untitled windows open when starting the recordings, especially if having broken out of the repeat loop.\n    repeat howMany times\n        set savePath to (the path to the desktop folder as text) & \"Recording_\" & recordingNumber & \".m4a\"\n        set recording to new audio recording\n        start recording\n        delay 6 -- Add an additional second to the wanted value, e.g. for 20 second recording set delay to 21.\n        stop recording\n        export document \"Untitled\" in file savePath using settings preset \"Audio Only\"\n        delay 2 -- Set appropraite delay to allow export to complete.\n        close (every document whose name contains \"Untitled\") saving no\n        set recordingNumber to recordingNumber + 1 -- Increments recording number by one.\n        -- Close \"Export Progress\" window.\n        tell application \"System Events\" to click menu item \"Hide Export Progress\" of menu \"Window\" of menu bar 1 of process \"QuickTime Player\"\n        display dialog \"Click OK or press Enter to start next recording.\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nRun the script as is a time or two so you can see what it's doing and then you can change the value of howMany to the number of recordings you want/need to make, change the value of the first delay from '6' to '21' for a 20 second recording and the value of the second delay from '2' to e.g. '5'.  The value of the second delay you'll need to determine ahead of time by setting the value of howMany to 1 or 2 and the value of the first delay from '6' to '21' so you have a 20 second recording to see how many seconds it takes to export.  This value (of the second delay) can be higher then actually needed, say if you want a little break between recordings to catch your breath and collect your thoughts for the next recording, although there is another control in the form of a dialog message box between each recording.\nNote the line display dialog \"Click OK or press Enter to start next recording.\", it's there as a control mechanism to start the next recording or to break out of the repeat loop. There are many different of ways to code and accomplish a task like this and this is just meant to give you a starting framework to build upon if you want to use AppleScript to accomplish an automated task such as you've mentioned.\nThere is no error checking written into this script as is, meaning if the script is run a second time it will overwrite e.g. \"Recording_1.m4a\", \"Recording_2.m4a\" etc. So if you need to break out of the repeat loop by clicking \"Cancel\" in the dialog message box or \"Stop\" in the Script Editor, make sure you set recordingNumber to the appropriate number, which would be the number used of the last exported file + 1.  Also, the first close (every document whose name contains \"Untitled\") saving no line will close any file opened in QuickTime Player whose name contains \"Untitled\" without saving it or prompting to be saved. It can be commented out by placing -- in front of it if you wish although if you broke out of the repeat loop you'll have to manually cleanup before restarting so you may want to leave it as is.  Just when using this script only use QuickTime Player for the task at hand if you don't understand why I coded it this way.\n", "Q: Can I use someone's Apple ID Email to Text Them on Their iPad if I Don't Have an iPhone? Can I send a text to a friend's iPad if I use their email address as their Apple ID? I have an Amazon Fire smartphone.\nWill the message get to them from my phone?\n\nA: Yes, you can send a text message to your friend using your Amazon Fire, to their iPad, but only if they have an iPhone as well. \nIf they do, then your message will either go SMS (Short Message Service), which is basically what you know as a text message, or MMS (Multimedia Message Service), which is what gets sent when you send a photo to a friend with a text messaging app.\nYour friend will need to have iMessage set up on their iPad, and they will need to have an iPhone as well in order to receive SMS/MMS messages from someone not on iMessage. \nThe setting for this is actually in the iPhone's settings. It will not matter if you send it through an email address or a telephone number, if they do not have an iPhone, and you are not sending the text through iMessage, their iPad will not get the message. If you had an iPhone or iPad or Mac with iMessage on it, then you could in fact send text messages to one another via iMessage, as those messages travel exclusively on Apple's network.\nI do not know for sure, but I have a feeling that SMS/MMS go through the Mobile Network Provider's system and only gets to Apple's iMessage network when it goes from the Mobile Service to the iPhone, which then can reroute it to iMessage and then to the devices linked to that iPhone. \n\nA: No, you will have to have a device running either OSX or iOS for it to work, eg a MacBook, iMac, iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad to name a few. iMessage works on these platforms only. Other messages will either be sent as SMS or emails, depending on the client you are sending from and other unknown variables.\n", "Q: How to use old Apple remote with Apple TV I have an old white infrared Apple remote for a 2008 Macbook. I lost my apple TV remote and can't get passed the setup screen. I can see that the Macbook remote is noticed by the Apple TV because the light blinks when I use it, but it doesn't control anything. Is there a way to pair it? At least temporarily so I can use the Remote app?\n\nA: On the white remote, you must first press and hold the Menu and Previous/Rewind buttons for 6 seconds.  This will clear out any old paired remote.\nThen, press and hold the Menu and Next/Fast-forward buttons for 6 seconds.  This will pair with your remote.\n(Source: Apple support page)\n", "Q: How to create solid blocks of colored background in Apple Pages? In Pages 5, some templates have blocks of background color, like in the For Rent Flyer where it has gray blocks of color at the top and the bottom.\nI can delete the text in front, but I can't figure out what the color blocks are. Can someone please tell me what these are, and how I can create/modify them in my own documents?\n\n\nA: These blocks are simply Shapes that are in the background.  In the template you reference, they are locked.  Click on the \"Block\" and you will notice little 'x' in the corners.  To unlock so you can move them, select Unlock on the Arrange tab in the inspector.\nTo create your own shapes, select the insert shape icon on the toolbar.  In the Style tab on the inspector you can change its color, position and other attributes.  See the screenshot below.\nJust know that Pages, like many other apps, uses layers.  So move your shapes to the back in order to display text or pictures on top.

I need to get QuickTime Player to store its temporary files on another disk. I found an answer here, which I tried, but QuickTime Player quits with an error when I try to make a Screen Recording.

Keeper 4 is an external HD. I tried it with and without an existing QuicktimeScratch directory.\n\nA: It seems that Apple doesn't want you to do this for whatever reason, so they prevent the symbolic link hack from working at the level of the Data/ subdirectory. After fooling around with this, I found a workable solution one level up:\n$ cd ~/Library/Containers/\n$ mv com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.backup/\n$ ln -s /Volumes/<NAME_OF_VOLUME>/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/ .\n\nNo need for a double link trick this time around.\n", "Q: Create a Global Shortcut for a Single Letter The \"w\" key on my MacBook Pro broke due to water damage. Currently I am copy and pasting the letter whenever I need that, but I would prefer to be able to press a keyboard shortcut to type it.\nThe shortcut needs to be available no matter the app; I would prefer the shortcut to be control + option (just those two keys) but if that's not possible then I'll settle for something else.\nI tried setting a shortcut through the settings app, but I couldn't figure out how to 1) bind a single letter and 2) have the shortcut available globally.\nI'm running Yosemite 10.10.3\n\nA: One relatively simple method is to assign a text input that is then converted into \"w\" when you type your sequence.\nI have chosen to type \"(v)\" that is converted to \"w\", but you can choose what suits you best (and what you can remember).\nOpen Keyboard-Text pref in the System Preferences, as described in this Apple Support page.\nClick on the + sign to add a new item.\nNow first type your choice, then paste a \"w\" in the right column.\n\nIt will work on almost all OS X apps, but won't work on web pages like this one.\n\nA: Buscar's answer gives you a good option.\nAnother way that you can do this is to show the Keyboard Viewer which you can access from the menu bar. It will show up as a flag if you set it to display that way next to the volume icon.\n\nThen all you need to do is mouse click the W when you need to use it.\nUPDATE\nA universal keyboard option would be to use a clipboard manager. If you read this article it will tell you more about them. From the article it says that they all have a way of favoriting a particular past and assigning it to a key combination like command + 1, etc.\nUPDATE 2\nbjbk gave me an idea. You could get one of the wireless blue-tooth keyboards that Apple ships with iMacs. Then you just connect via blue-tooth and brand new keyboard, and it slips in the same pocket as a laptop. I have seen many people pair these with iPads.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool is another great example.\nDownload BTT from here. Once you have it open go to the keyboard option and enter in your shortcut (I chose opt+ctrl+z since that should be an uncommon shortcut).

Does deleting iCloud backups delete the associated data immediately or does Apple retain the data for a period of time? \n\nA: Only the people that wrote the code that makes up iCloud will know for sure. If you trust the company, then no, they won't retain it, not knowingly at least.\n\nA: I believe there would be a time frame to which the data would be able to be retained given some simple knowledge of server configurations.\nYou could think of the iCloud server as a series of hard drives all connected together and connected to the Internet. Some of the hard drive are used for saving your information and your iCloud account allows you to choose how big you want your iCloud storage capacity to be.\nOther hard drives are used to backup those hard drives. These would be used in the case a large number of the hard drives were not working properly. In this case your information is still saved, which is a very smart and good business practice.\nSome other hard drives are used when only one of the hard drives with customer information is failing, then this drive will pickup where it left off so there are no service issues. Also, very smart practice.\nSo as far as that information which has been deleted, it is probably still able to be retained for a period of time, after which it would be overwritten on the drives which backup the drives with the original data. Your privacy would still be respected due to the high encryption level of iCloud. \nLastly, retaining the information through an interface such as the Settings>iCloud pane in iOS would not be available. However, the information may still be able to be retained in the case it were done on accident.\n", "Q: iTunes Search for a Song X Many Minutes Long Can I search for a song in my music library that is between x and y start and end times, respectively?\n\nA: This is only possible by creating a smart playlist.\nBelow the playlist sidebar click on the plus-button and choose to add a new smart playlist.

But the srt files I have transferred to my iPad cannot be removed even after I have deleted the movies from my iPad. \nBefore there were only some files, so it was not a problem for me but now it's been a mess. I tried to delete it from the iPad but the files aren't visible there. I don't have Macbook. I tried to delete via Windows, but the delete option doesn't work. \n\nA: So you have lot of subtitles hanging around loosely. There are two ways you can remove these annoying creatures. I will discuss both of them, use whichever suits you best. \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete and re-install the VLC app.\n\n*Take a deep breath, this is going to be long. There is a work-around that I've found and works 9/10 times. \n\n\nTheory: \nWhat VLC does in the background is that, it deletes the subtitles files automatically  whenever you delete the parent video file, provided that the video and the subtitle have same name.\nFor example, if your video file is named \"test.mkv\" then the subtitle file should be \"test.srt\"\nWhat you need: \n\n\n*\n\n*A video clip, format doesn't matter, and smaller the size is\nbetter as it will take less time to get copied.\n\n*iTunes\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad to your computer and go to iTunes.\n\n*In iTunes, go the \"Apps\" section of your iPad and find your way to VLC.\n\n*Copy all the parent-less subtitles to one folder in your desktop.\n\n*Create copies of the video clip as many as the number of subtitles present in that folder. For example, If you have 4 subtitles, then you create 4 copies of the same video clip.\n\n*Rename each video clip to one of the subtitle. Take caution while renaming, don't change the extension/format of the video clip.\n\n*Once you have the video clips renamed, copy the video clips to back to VLC. \n\n*Save and eject the iPad from iTunes and computer. \n\n*Go the VLC app in your iPad and start deleting those renamed video clips.\n\n\nSo, as per the theory, when you delete the video clip, VLC will delete its subtitle as well simultaneously.\n\nA: You will need to connect your mobile device to a larger device to delete those files as you will require iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your mobile device (iPad or iPhone) to a laptop or desktop PC;\n\n*Open iTunes;\n\n*Make sure the device (iPad or iPhone) trusts the laptop or desktop PC and is able to communicate with it;\n\n*In iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the small icon of the connected mobile device (e.g. small iPad icon) on the top;\n\n*Click on Apps under Settings;\n\n*Scroll down till the bottom and click on VLC in Apps;\n\n*Select the file(s) you want to delete in the right section (VLC Documents);\n\n*Press the Del button on your keyboard;\n\n*Confirm clicking on Delete;\n\n\n", "Q: Screenshot of selected area with shadow?

Is there any single user mode or safe mode on a Mac?

In the account list - this account is NOT present - so I couldn't remove it. \n\n\nI think mail is either confused somehow because this old account has been replaced by a similar account (anne@mydomain.com is now anne.stahl@mydomain.com). Or, perhaps the old account is still on one of my other devices (iPhone or iPad) and somehow saved in the cloud (I checked the devices). \n\nA: After trying all sorts of things with Keychain and other devices I finally figured out what is causing this. The offending 'account' was in the SMTP list. You can find this by going to 'Preferences' in the Mail app, select the 'Accounts' tab, click on the dropdown for 'Outgoing Mail Server' and there you can 'Edit SMTP Server list'. \n\n", "Q: Trying to find file location of Mac Mail Smartboxes so that I can run automatic email archiver I'm currently working on a MacBook late 2008 with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.\nI use Mac Mail for my email.\nI have created smart mailboxes to collect together emails that relate to a project number.\nWhen the project is complete I want to be able to archive the emails into PDFs and store them on Dropbox.\nI have purchased Email Archiver for the purpose.\nEmail Archiver needs the source folder destination and I can't find the smartbox location.

If that isn't the case, then those need to be in sync. EDIT: Also as y3sh found out, having more than one iCloud account can cause additional issues.\nNext open the Bluetooth Settings on both devices turn on their antennas. You will also need to have the WiFi antenna of your Mac turned on. It is not necessary to have the iPhone WiFi antenna on, so long as it is set up to use Cellular Data.\nAt this point you should be able to see your \"Instant\" Hotspot as a selection under your available WiFi Networks. Clicking on it will establish the link and takes care of the rest. You will not need to have established the link with Personal Hotspots before, and you will not need to add the password seen in Personal Hotspots. Instant Hotspots takes care of the log in for you automatically.\nThere is a switch under Settings> Personal Hotspots that will be automatically turned on by Instant Hotspot when it forms the connection. If you do not want your iPhone to continue broadcasting its Hotspot after you have completed your session, you may have to manually turn this option off. A blue menu bar at the top of your iPhone will tell you whether or not it is still broadcasting the Hotspot. There is a switch under Settings> Personal Hotspots that will be green. Switch that off and the Hotspot will stop broadcasting.\nAnother note is that you are NOT required to have Handoff under General>Handoff & Suggested Apps turned on on your iPhone in order to form the Instant Hotspot form the connection between your iPhone and your Mac.\nAfter all of this you should see your iPhone as an option under WiFi on your MBP. If you click it, the Instant Hotspot should be established right away.

Apple introduced a nasty issue with OSX 10.10.3 (see also questions here and here).

Turns out, it's actually just my phone. Somewhere down the line, the jack began just popping out of the port, seemingly at random. Later on I found out it only happens when the jack rotates at any degree (which happens surprisingly often if your phone's in your pocket). It only happens with headphones though, I've tested it on AUX cords and there's no issue with those whatsoever. My questions are why is this happening, what can I do to fix it, and if I can't fix it, who'd be able to?\n\nA: Take a toothpick and carefully clean out any dirt or lint from the headphone jack.

The system lost power and when it came back up, the drive wouldn't mount.  I tried Repair Disk in Disk Utility, and it didn't complete successfully -- I didn't note the error message but it was essentially \"recover any files you can from backups and reformat\".\nI connected the drive to a Windows machine, which saw some files, at least, but complained that the disk needed to be repaired.  I let the disk repair tool run and it said it completed successfully.  I hooked it back up to the Mac, and while almost everything is fine, there are a few subfolders missing.  Critically, I think a few folders whose contents may have been being accessed during the power failure are just totally gone.\nThe disk passes Verify in Disk Utility as well as Windows verification tools.  I ran recuva on the Windows box and while it turned up a large number of recoverable files, they were all files I had deleted ages ago on the Mac. There were even more unrecoverable files, but they were also from the distant past.  None of the files in the folders that were accessed during the power cut were listed at all.\nNow, I have backups of much of the data, and a lot of it was rips of DVDs we still have on the shelf, so if I can't fix this I'm only losing a few of my evenings babysitting Handbrake.  But I'd really like to make sure this never happens again while e.g. viewing our family photos.  Is this a known issue?  Is there anything I can do to recover the missing folders?\n\nA: exFAT is not optimal for your situation probably, but unfortunately there isn't really a no-brainer solution for using an external drive frequently with both OS X and Windows, reading/writing large files, and with really low risk of data loss.\nexFAT is not a journalled file system, so there is higher probability of data loss than with NTFS or HFS+. exFAT uses a single file allocation table and a single free space map, so there is a higher likelihood of file system corruption due to that (such as if a removable device is disconnected during a write). exFAT does do checksumming that allows it to detect some problems and repair to a consistent state, but that doesn't actually prevent loss of actual data. If it is plugged in and used frequently, that raises the risk that it will be transferring data if a disconnection or power failure happens, which isn't good.\nYou'd probably be better off going with NTFS - native on Windows and use something like Paragon NTFS in OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT\n\n*http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/review-is-microsofts-new-data-sharing-system-a-cross-platform-savior/\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4154638\nFor recovering the missing data and folders (data and with proper directory structure) - there is a good chance they are damaged so it won't be simple if possible. You might be best off babysitting Handbrake some more as you say and recreating the data you need. I might have suggested seeking professional data recovery help, but it sounds like this isn't something critical to you and probably not worth paying for. For example an engineer at a company like ours would have many recovery tools at their disposal and would either try many or know which ones would have the best ability given the situation after some investigating of the damage. Plus they're also experienced. I have seen them recover data from damaged file systems including good file names and directory structure when some software tools are unable to help, because there are actually enough parts of the file table remaining to work from if the tool can do it. \nYou could try more software recovery tools, particularly ones that recover specific file types, but it will cost money, and at some point it's just cheaper to go with a data recovery company... and for you, to recreate the data.\n", "Q: iCloud Photo library and photo stream - deleting photos from phone only If I turn on iCloud Photo library, it tells me \"Photos and videos synced from iTunes will be removed.\" From where? Which photos and videos? I just want to delete photos from my phone because of storage issues. I'm fine with turning off photo stream, but someone said I should first \"link iCloud Photo library.\" Which takes me to the first problem. Can someone clarify? I don't want to permanently lose anything! Thank you!\n\nA: It appears you have synced photos into your iPhone via iTunes. You can select folders from your computer and sync them to your iOS devices when connected (or via Wifi if you have that option checked).\niCloud Photo Library is letting you know you'll lose those synced albums on the phone.\nTo check which photos and / or videos, you can connect your iPhone to your computer , start iTunes up and go to the Photos section on your device menu:\n\nas you can see, you can select different options to sync photos from your computer back to your iPhone\n\nIf you do not remember setting this up, or if it appears un checked, as in my screenshots, you are probably not connected to the original iTunes (or iTunes library) that set this up.\nChecking which are the images that will be lost directly on your phone is a bit more tricky, as the only obvious sign is that you cannot delete the album nor the images directly from it. So, you could go checking albums until you find one that does not allows you to delete pictures –although this will also be the case with iCloud Shared albums you joined. The good news is that you probably have a copy of those pictures elsewhere, unless you've lost the computer which synced them in the first place.\nTurning My Photo Stream off will stop it from receiving pictures made with other iOS devices or saved on iPhoto / Photos app configured with the service. It will not save space if you don't have other devices behaving in that fashion. It will also stop it to upload them to those other devices, if this is part of your archiving system, keep that in mind.\nTurning iCloud Photo Library on will upload a copy of all the pictures taken or saved (but not synced via iTunes) on your iPhone to iCloud, and, depending on the configuration, it will try to save space on your device by erasing the original on your iPhone afterwards and leaving a copy with lower resolution. If this setting is not activated, no space will be saved. Erasing the pictures on your iOS device with iCloud Photo Library on will permanently erase the pictures on all synced devices and on iCloud, so be sure to have a backup.\n", "Q: Why do I need internet to listen to my music library? I was taking a walk yesterday, and I was listening to music in my personal library. No Apple Music subscription. After awhile, my music stopped. I checked, and it said something about needing internet to access music and turning on cellular music in settings or something like that. It happened again today at the mall.  I'm confused... I thought that my personal library was on my device. Is it? By the way, I am using an iPod touch 6th generation and running (gulp) iOS 9 public beta. My best guess is it's the beta. Maybe they don't want all my music on my device in case I have to reset it. But wouldn't it be backed up to iTunes? \n\nA: Yipee! I figured it out! My problem is, as I forgot to mention in the question, I just got a new iPod. Aaaaaaand, I never realized it, but apparently when you get a new device, you have to download all your music into your library. Otherwise, you can still listen to it, but only over internet. Probably to save space. Downloading your songs can be done by tapping on the song or album, and then tapping \"Make available offline\".\nThank you everyone for your help!\n\nA: I solved the problem which happened after moving to ITunes 12 4 3 and Windows 10 by restoring the iPod to factory settings and then reloading the library.\nI can't say I like the new ITunes programme. It certainly is inferior to what went before.\n", "Q: Restore Safari browser on MacBook Air Yosemite OSX 10.10.4 How do I restore my Safari browser.  I accidentally deleted it. Now I have to use Google or Bing.  Whoops!\n\nA: Many who are new to the Mac and OS X mistakenly think they have deleted something if they accidentally or purposely remove a icon from the Dock.\nIf that is what you have done, restoring it to the Dock is easily done.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your Applications folder\n\n*Locate Safari\n\n*Drag to the dock\n\n\nOr, double click on it and it will open.  There you can pin it to the Dock. By long pressing the icon or right clicking and select options.  See screenshot below.  The other way to keep it there is simply to drag it to a new location on the Dock closer to the Finder icon.\nIf you dragged it to the Trash from the Applications folder, the open the trash folder by double clicking on it and restoring from there.\nIf you truly deleted it, which is very hard to do \"accidentally\", a restore of your OS may be in order.\n\n", "Q: Why are some of music files not being added to my iCloud Music Library?

You can see some of the tracks in this screen shot, they have the dashed outline cloud next to them:\n\nThere are no relevant errors I could find in Console that would shed some light on why these tracks are not updating in my library. And, as you can see, other tracks from the same album updated just fine. I left iTunes running on my machine for several days and no progress was made on any tracks with this problem.\nIf I try and edit the information of one of the tracks I get the following pop-up:\n\nAnd the tracks are not visible in the Music app on my iPhone -- they're listed in the album's tracks, but they are dimmed and unplayable.\nI am not over my iTunes Match library quota -- I have only ~14,000 songs in my library and the limit is current 25,000.\nHow can I diagnose the problem that's preventing these tracks from syncing to my iCloud Music Library?\nHow can I get these tracks sync'ed so I can stream them from my other devices attached to my iTunes account?\n\nA: There's an option in the menus to force an update of the iCloud Music Library: File > Library > Update iCloud Music Library.\n\nThis caused a spinner to appear in the upper right-hand corner of iTunes and, once it disappeared, all my formerly-unavailable tracks were now available in my iCloud Music Library for streaming from my other devices.\n\nThere was no need to log out and back in to my iTunes account.\n\nA: These might be duplicates. Sometimes a track is part of two albums (like a\n\"best of\" album for example).\nFailing that, sign out, sign back in and re-sync the library (IIRC from the account menu in iTunes).\n", "Q: What are some good two factor methods for logging onto your Mac? What are some options I can deploy to require users to use multi factor authentication when logging onto their Macs. In the same fashion you use your password and Google Authenticator code to log into Gmail, GitHub, Slack, etc., is there something for logging into your Mac. \n\nA: How about something like Knock?  http://www.knocktounlock.com\nIt's not exactly the same as looking up a time-dependent code, but does require the 'second factor' in order to unlock.\nThe neat thing is that many apps (I think Knock included) run on Bluetooth, so when you walk away from the Mac and the BT disconnects, it automatically locks up the machine.\n\nA: SAASpass provides Bluetooth proximity-based (Mavericks and up), scan-QR-on-Mac-with-iOS-device and OTP as second factor.\n\nA: A quick Google gives a few viable options, but true two-factor authentication is extremely difficult to implement on a Mac. Since Apple does not provide a solution for this, a third party would need to create an app that works with either a SMS or a companion iPhone app. The only problem is Apple does not let developers make a way to prevent the person from using their computer. You could find a solution that creates a new password and sets the account password every time you sleep or log out, but it would still not be as easy and smooth as iCloud or Google two-step verification. \n", "Q: Resizing system partition When I installed OSX Mavericks, I left free space after my system partition in case I wanted to install a second OS there.  This has proved unnecessary — I've never modified the partition table — and I'd like to integrate that space into my system partition.\nIn theory, this can be done quite easily with Disk Utility.  However, this does not seem to work for me.  When I select the Partition tab for the drive in Disk Utility, I see a small unnamed partition at the top, followed by my system partition, followed by blank space.  There is a pull-tab at the bottom right of the system partition.  I can pull that tab down to fill the empty space with the system partition.  However, when I hit Apply and confirm, the message \"Preparing to partition disk\" shows up next to a barber-pole wait indicator and never goes away.\nAnswers to other questions suggest that this issue can be resolved by running Verify and Repair on both the system partition and the drive on which it is located.  Verify on the partition shows no errors; Verify on the drive indicates that it doesn't have an EFI partition — a problem which Repair proves unable to fix.\nRunning $ diskutil list from the command line reveals the following partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*0: The GPT\n\n*1: The small partition is labeled Microsoft Reserved; I gather that this is set up by OSX install to facilitate possible later Boot Camp installation.\n\n*2: There is an EFI partition (!) located between the Microsoft Reserved partition and the system partition\n\n*3: system partition\n\n*4: Recovery partition\n\n\ndiskutil doesn't explicitly indicate the location of these partitions, so I installed the brew package gptfdisk and ran sgdisk -p, which confirmed that the Recovery partition is located direction after system.\nSO:  My hypothesis is that Disk Utility is unable to grow the system partition because there is a partition immediately following it.  If this is the case, I'm confused as to why the OSX installer would put it there instead of at the end of the disk.  But anyway: if this is really the issue, what's the easiest, and preferably free, way to move it to the end of the disk?  I could use dd to get it there, but I'm unaware of any tools that can reliably edit the partition table.  (sgdisk could do this, but the brew version is 0.8.something, so I don't really trust it.)\nAre there any special things I need to keep in mind when changing the partition table?  There seems to be something wrong with it already (given the EFI issue).\nIt's looking like I'll need to set up a rescue boot disk, so recommendations on those are gladly accepted.\nEDIT: Question is a tome already but somebody asked for output so here it is:\n$ diskutil list /dev/disk0\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *512.1 GB   disk0\n   1:         Microsoft Reserved                         134.2 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS system                  319.2 GB   disk0s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s4\n\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nPassword:\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34      262144      1  GPT part - [GUID REDACTED]\n      262178        2014         \n      264192      409600      2  GPT part - [GUID REDACTED]\n      673792   623464448      3  GPT part - [GUID REDACTED]\n   624138240     1269760      4  GPT part - [GUID REDACTED]\n   625408000   374807183         \n  1000215183          32         Sec GPT table\n  1000215215           1         Sec GPT header\n\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0        geometry: 62260/255/63 [1000215216 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1000215215] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused   \n\n\nA: I ended up setting up an Ubuntu USB boot drive, rebooting into Ubuntu, and using gparted to write a new partition table that changed the partition type of the Microsoft Recovery to ext4 and named it.

According to this post:\nOn OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\nthe file:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\n\nstores the list of built in exclusions where the /home path is under paths that are excluded. Can I delete the line that contains the /home directory in order to add it to the list of directories that time machine will back up? What are some unintended consequences that I might run into by doing this?\n\nA: You don't need to do this. OS X uses /Users/(username) instead. /home is there for compatibility.\nThis Apple Support Document describes how Mac OS X handles multiple users.\n\nYour home folder isn’t actually named “Home.” It’s named with your user name.

I have been trying all day to reformat the main drive in it, I have using the regular disk utility and terminal. I have tried for un-mounting and reformatting but nothing is working. I have narrowed it down to the recovery volume on the drive that refuses to unmount. Is there a way to run in recovery mode without using the hard drive?

Any suggestions on how to get this sucker to comply?\nI want to: Reformat the main drive completely It seems every partition but the recovery is complying\n\nA: You can't completely reformat/erase/repartition the drive you are booting from (assuming you are booting from the recovery partition on your main disk drive).\nSo boot to a bootable DVD, a second (external) hard drive, a bootable thumb drive or boot to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing altcmdR while starting your Mac.\nThen open Disk Utility and reformat the internal drive.\n", "Q: how to do a batch change (shift) of file creation date OS X Yosemite:\nI took thousands of pictures on a trip recently, some from my iPhone, and some from my DSLR camera.\nNow, the iPhone automatically gets its time and date from the local cell towers, but the DSLR stayed set with the time and date of its original configuration.\nSo basically now when I mix all the photos together and sort them by time and date, they are all out of order.  I would like to view the photos chronologically and to do that I need to shift the date and time of all the DSLR photos by the same (time zone) offset.\nSo basically, I need a command line or a script that will do something like this:\nif filename = DSC_*.*\nthen creation_date = creation_date + 5 hours\n\nI'm asking this for OS X specifically, but I guess it would be interesting to know how to do this in Windows or Linux as well.\n\nA: Here is a condensed and modified version of the script info in the link I gave you in the comments. You can save it as a plain text file, without an extension, and make it executable per info in the link, e.g. chmod +x filename.  Place the script in a folder that's in your $PATH e.g.: /usr/local/bin/\nThis script sets both the created and modified date/time stamp on each DSC_*.* file +5 hours on the DSC_*.* files in the working directory.\nIn a Terminal then cd to the directory containing the DSC_*.* files and then type the name you gave to the script and press enter.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in DSC_*.*; do\n    ts=\"$(GetFileInfo -d \"$f\")\"\n    e=\"$(date -j -f \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\" \"$ts\" +%s)\"\n    ((o=60*60*5))\n    ((e+=o))\n    nd=\"$(date -r $e \"+%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\")\"\n    SetFile -m \"$nd\" \"$f\"\n    SetFile -d \"$nd\" \"$f\"\ndone\n\nIn case the comment to the OP gets deleted the code above is based on the answer to Updating File Created Date by x number of days Mac OSX and modified to the +5 hours requested.  If you only want to change the created time then comment out, placing a # in front of, or removing the SetFile -m \"$nd\" \"$f\" line.\n\nA: There is a great little application called shootShifter on the App Store (and maybe directly) which is designed for exactly this.

I gave an iPhone 3G to a friend who lives in Dubai. At the time, it was carrier locked to at&t. I have since submitted a request here in the U.S. to unlock it, and the request was approved by at&t. For some reason, he's having trouble getting it to unlock, and I think I know why.\nAm I correct in assuming that he needs to have access to an at&t tower in order for the phone to talk to it and grab the updated carrier settings, which would then unlock the device? \nIf so, this is obviously an impossibility in Dubai. My workaround solution to get him an unlocked iPhone is to send him the one I just unlocked here in the States.\nWould love to know if there's a way he can unlock remotely (perhaps drive near a partner/roaming tower?) if at all possible.\nMeantime, I also performed the same procedure on an iPhone 3GS I had sitting around and found that the unlock occurred after it talked to the at&t tower. \"Carrier settings updated\" was the title of the message. Phone says \"No Service\" but I have to presume it's now unlocked since the carrier settings have been updated.\nAny cell network pros out there know how this works?\nThanks.\n\nA: iPhone unlock is a remote process done by your carrier directly with Apple.\nFrom Apple Support:\nAfter your carrier confirms that your iPhone unlock has been processed (…)\nIf you have a SIM card from a carrier other than your current carrier, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove your SIM card and insert the new SIM card.\n\n*Complete the setup process.\n\n\nIf you don't have another SIM card you can use, follow these steps to complete the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your iPhone.\n\n*When you have a backup, erase your iPhone.\n\n*Restore your iPhone from the backup you just made.\n\n\nIt does not mention anything on having to be on an area covered by your original carrier, but the process apparently needs internet.\n\n(…) contacts the registration database (…) to determine the lock status and set the appropriate carrier settings file if needed.\n\nSee this question for additional information.\n\nA: There are multiple ways of going about unlocking an iPhone. First, you can contact AT&T if you are a current customer who is eligible for an unlock. This process can take up to several weeks.  The second way is going through a third party service such as http://www.unlockingofficial.com to have them unlock it for you. Services like this are usually very quick.

Note that no path has been changed since I deleted all those files and directories. Anyway, I am thinking about using Bash.\nIs there a putback command in bash?\n\nA: This solution works on a single file in Trash or multiple files deleted from within the same directory:\nIf it's not essential for you to use Terminal, you can forget all those bash, zsh, and all other typealot ways to do this.

Does anybody know how to disable OSX from throttling/underclocking the CPU on a Macbook when the battery gets low on power? I think the feature is called SpeedStep. The problem is that my battery is damaged and no longer works so I have to run my Macbook off of the power adaptor and I would like the system to run up to speed, instead of at 0.8 GHz, so I can use it until I get a new battery. I have a Macbook Pro 13\" Late 2013 i5 2.6 GHz with Retina(11,1).

I know there are some hackintosh boot loaders, such as clover, that support modified SSDT and DSDT, but I'm not sure if that will work for my problem. Any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: So, after researching more and trying other methods, what can I say:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to disable the SpeedStep when using MacBook Pro without a battery? and it's answer pointing to “Fixing” kernel_task CPU Problems in MacOS 10.7/10.8 will help you with problems where processes take a lot of percentage from the processing time. Doing the trick will turn your macbook useable, but the Ghz will stay at minimum.\n\n*The new kernel power management works only from Ivy Bridge forward, so Macs equiped with Sandy Bridge or older processors still using the old power management and therefore the kernel patch won't work.\n\n*Removing AppleIntelPowerManagement kexts won't help, and NullCPUPowerManagement won't help too… I still get the same 0.8Ghz.\n\n*Using apps like SMCFanControl will help with controlling the fans, so any reply that helps getting the original clock are welcome as the chance of burning the processor due to heat are diminished.\n\n\nSo for now I think that will be all. If I get any solution to work, I will report it here!\n\nA: You may have checked to see that this question has already been asked. So as not not add to the endless recursing of the internet, the answer to the question points here.\nThis is an older post and relates to OS X 7 and 8, though there are several comments with patches/updates for newer OS versions and hardware revisions (this started with Apple's move to Intel, so you should be all set on that front).\nNote I do NOT recommend this. Macs are notorious for not responding to hardware modifications (yes, you are attempting a hardware modification), I suspect you will be delighted by the fact that your CPU now runs as 2.2 GHz for about 45 minutes until it overheats and shuts down. The increased temperatures (please measure and report back if you try this) will also considerably shorten the life of your MacBook as a whole.\nAs a P.S.: Intel's PowerGadget may allow you to view real-time scaling, so you can watch CPU activity (along with memory pressure, cache misses, and disk IO) as you run benchmarks and check your workflow, to see if the CPU is actually a bottleneck for you (I suspect it is not)\n", "Q: Can't create/adjust/delete a partition So I wanted to create a new partition to test the new El Capitan operating system.

I assume you know how to do that.\nIf you wish to take closer look it is in the \nSaved crashreport to /var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/SpringBoard_2015-07-29-082429_Ahmads-iPod-touch.plist using uid: 0 gid: 0, synthetic_euid: 501 egid: 0\nI also took the liberty to format your post in to a readable format.\n", "Q: Syncing Photos.app with external HDD I want to have my photo library to sync all the pictures on the HDD, which I can easily reference them by deselecting \"copy items to the photo library\" and import them.\nbut I want that if I delete the photo in the photos.app, then it would delete the referenced file too. Is that possible? \n \n\nA: Importing without coping to the library doesn't give Photos.app ownership of the file. So to be safe you can't delete it directly from the application. You can right-click on the picture and select Show related file in Finder and delete it from there. Unfortunately, it will not delete it from the photo library so you have to do it by yourself.\n", "Q: Removing smell from leather Apple Watch band? I have a \"Classic Buckle\" style leather band for my Apple Watch.  After having it for about two months now, the band has really begun to stink due to moisture and sweat!\nHas anyone found a good way to clean the band and manage the smell?  I have done a simple wipe down like Apple recommends, and also taken it off for longer periods to dry out, but that hasn't really helped.\n\nA: Since it is just a normal leather watch band if you remove it from the apple watch, I suggest following the same cleaning directions as normal analog watch owners use.\na quick google search yielded this result: ebay watch band cleaning guide\n", "Q: What are the recommended steps to take before selling an iPhone? I \"lost\" my iPhone at work, could not find it anywhere. I reported it lost, and got another through the insurance. A month later, I found it hiding in a file in one my desk drawers. The phone is just less than a year old, in near new condition, and it seems a waste to discard it. What has to be done to be able to sell it to someone who needs a working phone? \n\nA: In terms of privacy - unlink your AppleID account and just go to Settings > General > Reset.

I have an iPod Shuffle and would like to open a separate account at iTunes using the same e-mail though. Can I do that? \n\nA: The answer is, quite clearly, no. If this were possible, how would Apple distinguish between the multiple accounts?(That's a rhetorical question. I'm sure there are many ways to go about his, but it would be extremely annoying and inconvenient for both you and Apple).\nHowever, if you are not to keen to set up a new email, you can still set up a new Apple ID without an existing email address. And if there are any songs, apps, movies, etc. you want to be on both accounts, use Family Sharing. \n", "Q: Spilt coffee on Keyboard, washed/dryed but 2 keys still not working, any cure? I spilt coffee on an apple external wired keyboard. Taking the advice of other threads on this matter I washed it thoroughly and dried it, twice. However 2 of the keys are still non functional. Does this mean it is permanently busted? Or can I still fix it somehow? Or can it economically be fixed by an apple support shop or similar??\n\nA: What model is it? Take off the back to get to the logic board and membrane and clean each with isopropyl alcohol, I repair Apple stuff and as long as the board and membrane are dry before you power them, the alcohol shouldn't hurt anything. If the key's still aren't working, don't throw the keyboard away, sell it for parts on eBay. You might make a little bit of money and someone might be happy to buy it just for keys and the case.\n", "Q: Installing git on OSX 10.8 without Xcode I'd like to setup my dev environment on my girlfriend's iMac, but she's not cool with me wasting 3GB of space, which is what Xcode takes up. She also doesn't want to/can't upgrade past 10.8 because then Photoshop won't work, or some nonsense.\nHow can I get git on OSX 10.8 without Xcode. I somehow doubt that it's impossible to run a few megabytes of git without 3GB of Xcode.\n\nA: There is a binary installer that you can download. See also the Getting Started - Installing Git of the git website:\n\nThere are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.\nIf you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. An OSX Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at http://git-scm.com/download/mac.\n\nHowever, as @denis points out, as of July 2017, the binaries on the download page of the Git website are for 10.9 or newer. If you look at where the binary files are actually hosted, on SourceForge, there is an a FAQ about which version of the binary installer to download if you have an older version of Mac OS X/macOS:\n\nWhich version should I download?\nIf you are running:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*10.6 Snow Leopard: git-*-snow-leopard\n  \n*10.7 Lion: git-*-snow-leopard\n  \n*10.8 Mountain Lion: git-*-snow-leopard\n  \n*10.9 Mavericks: git-*-mavericks\n  \n*10.10 Yosemite: git-*-mavericks\n  \n*10.11 Yosemite [sic]: git-*-mavericks\n  \n\nSo for 10.8, you'll want to download any binary installer that ends with the name -snow-leopard. There are several such binary installers, but the one with the most recent version of Git is git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg. Here is a direct download link for it (23.1 MB): https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.3.5-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download \n\nA: First of all you can download git directly, as Adam recommends.\nAs alternative to command line git tool you may want GUI app. I recommend Atlassian SourceTree. This is really nice and powerful Git/Mercurial client. I tried many GUI applications and only SourceTree satisfied me. Application package already has builtin Git and Mercurial.\nAt last, you may download Apple command line tools without XCode from Apple developer portal. If you are not developer yet, you should register in portal (it's easy and free).\n\nA: *\n\n*Download and install GIT: http://git-scm.com/\n\n*Add this to your .bash_profile file:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\n\n*Open a new terminal\n\n\nContent based on this awesome tutorial:\nhttp://blog.bobbyallen.me/2014/03/07/how-to-install-git-without-having-to-install-xcode-on-macosx/\n\nA: Note that this is a plain copy of a previous answer of mine on superuser.com.\nHere's a way to install git on Mac OS X without XCode.\nGit's official web site provides an installer : http://git-scm.com/download/mac\nAfter installing git, you also have to add its directory to your path :\n\necho \"PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:\\$PATH\" >> ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nAdding the directory to the path will prevent Mac OS X from aksing you to install XCode each time you type git in the terminal.\nCredits goes to Bobby Allen and to GoZoner's answer on SO.\n", "Q: Command key when running Mac through virtual box on Windows OS I just recently installed Yosemite in Virtualbox. Here's the installation video I followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYMEb0ZCfes\nMy OS is Windows and I'm trying to run Mac using Virtualbox.\nI had no problems with booting and stuff. After booting, Mac installation settings appeared, then the system asked me to set log in details (full name, username, password). However, while I am retyping my desired password, the screen suddenly turned black. I waited and did nothing. The next thing it showed was the start up screen where it asks for my username and password.\nI tried entering my username and password, but it won't work. I knew I haven't completed setting my log-in details due to the screen turning black. I searched for possible solutions, one thing I'd like to try is to use Recovery Mode and reset the password (http://www.macworld.com/article/2868032/what-to-do-if-your-mac-refuses-to-accept-your-password.html).\nHowever though, can't figure out how to key 'Command-R'. Does anyone know how?\nAlso, it would be great if someone could suggest other things that might work if ever pw reset through Recovery Mode fails. I'd appreciate it a lot.\n\nA: I would much rather point to this previous question/answer in a comment but my rep does not allow comments.\nThere are 3 answers: Windows key when running windows through virtual box on a mac\nBy default it's the right ⌘ (Command) Key.\nThe left ⌘ (Command) Key does not work because it is set as the Host (Meta) Key in VirtualBox.\nAnd they can be swapped simply by replacing the Host Key with the right ⌘ (Command) Key, in Preferences > Input > Virtual Machine > Host Key Combination.\n", "Q: Unable to expand \".zip\" into \"downloads\" (Error - 63 file name too long.) Unable to expand \"zip\" into \"downloads\" (Error - 63 file name too long.) on my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.5.\n\nA: If you install Better Zip or Pacifist Zip, you will be able to open the zip file and inspect the contents, file by file.\nThe file with the problematic long name - including folder names -  should be evident. If not, you can then extract the files one by one until you find the one(s) with the long name which are causing the problem.\nYou can rename the problematic files when using Better Zip and then resave the zip file.\nhttp://macitbetter.com/ Better Zip\nhttps://www.charlessoft.com/ Pacifist Zip\n\nA: You can try the following command in your terminal \nunzip -j file.zip\n\nThe -j switch will extract all files into the current directory, ignoring the directory structure of the compressed files, so be careful doing it in a populated directory.\n", "Q: How do I record my iPhone's screen and sound whilst recording my mic I have my iPhone plugged into my computer via USB, I have QuickTime Player open and am previewing my iPhone screen as well as the iPhone's audio, but how would I go about recording my audio from my microphone which is connected to my computer, all in QuickTime? I have tried Audacity, but that didn't work due to lag with QuickTime and that caused the audio to be horrendously out of sync.\n\nA: You can use the built in screen recorder in your iPhone. If you’re using iOS 11, it will record the sound from whatever source or website, and you can also select mic, and get both audio recordings.\nTo record your iPhone's screen. Go to Settings app → Control Centre → Customise Controls, and make sure to add Screen Recording to the include list.\n\nNow to record your iPhone's screen, swipe up from the bottom of your screen (swipe down from top right on iPhone X) to open Control Centre.\n\nThere is a circle with a solid dot in the middle, just press and hold it, it will open and ask you to record screen and if you want to record audio from the microphone as well.\n\nOnce finished, swipe to open Control Centre and tap the same recording button to stop. The recording will be saved to your camera roll.\n\nA: Try having two Quicktime recording windows open (one Movie recording--iPhone screen and audio, and one Audio recording for your microphone). Just start the two recording sessions together (they don't have to started at the exact same time, you can edit them later) and then use iMovie or Final Cut Pro to edit the clips so your iPhone audio and visual plays simultaneously with your other audio recording.\n", "Q: Preview print dialog defaults to Scale to Fit or Print Entire Image When printing a PDF file from Preview, the print dialog defaults to \"Scale to Fit / Print Entire Image\", and the default scale is some arbitrary number.  To get 100% scale requires clicking \"Scale\" and typing \"100\".\nI want the default to be \"Scale / 100%\", without clicking or typing.  How can I do this in Yosemite?\nThis question was answered before under \"Keep Preview from autoresizing print output\" but the solution there does not seem to work under Yosemite.  Saving as a preset does not work either.\n\nA: As a run around, you can print it from terminal. Assuming your default printer is the one you want\nlp -o fit-to-page /path/to/file.pdf\n\nor by dragging and dropping the pdf onto the printer, which should print it at 100% and auto-rotated \"fit to page\".

It looks like this:\n\nMy brother had the same problem:\n\n…but he just reconnected the ribbon cable and the screen began to work correctly. I tried several times to reconnect the ribbon cable, but to no avail.\nDoes anyone know what could be the problem?\n\nA: This happened to me as well. If your MacBook Pro was purchased between February 2011 and December 2013, Apple determined that a small percentage these systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts. Check out this link for the official Apple report.\n\nA: Most likely you got a bad replacement display. It could be the cable, connector or another part. It could also be the GPU, or associated video hardware. But I would bet on the replacement screen being the culprit.\n", "Q: Spigot - ApplicationManager quit unexpetedly Since a few days ago, about every 20 seconds a popup window appears saying that ApplicationManager quit unexpectedly:\n\nI can't think what I could've done to cause this, but what is ApplicationManager and how can I fix this?\nHere are the details:\nProcess:               ApplicationManager [606]\nPath:                  /Users/USER/Library/Application Support/Spigot/ApplicationManager\nIdentifier:            ApplicationManager\nVersion:               1.1 (1.1.18)\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

As an administrator, you also cannot delete important system files (built-in apps, operating system files, etc.).\n", "Q: Wifi hotspot with cell turned on but no connection? So, I can't test this because my 6 is not hooked up to my phone line (otherwise I would). Before \"closing as duplicate\" know that this question DOES NOT ask \"while I turned off cell data\", so it's not a duplicate.\nCell data is on, but has no reception. Can we form a wifi hotspot still?\nThe reason being, apple does not give you access to high speed peer-to-peer. They indirectly do it through multipeer, and GK requires an internet connection so there's no real point in using it for p2p. Multipeer is slow, even for small text strings, huge (.33 seconds) lag.\nSo basically, no bars, data turned on, wifi hotspot work to form a local area network?\nThanks\n\nA: It seems it is a yes, and Multipeer is not laggy if you remove the sample's fluff.\nI had \"no known\" connection, 0-1 bars, it gave me warnings but still let me turn on one or another network (borrowed someone's and used mine as the other peer in the middle of nowhere)\n", "Q: How do I map a Mac function to an 'unfindable' Windows keyboard key? The issue is this: I'm using a PC keyboard with my (closed) MBP at work, and am using Karabiner (TAFKA KeyRemap4MacBook) to map the Mac keys to their appropriate places on it. So far so good.\nHowever, on the number pad, adjacent to some volume buttons on the top row (which worked straight off, no mapping required) there's a key with a crescent moon on it, which would be perfect for inducing insta-sleep/lock. But I can't find it in Karabiner, or Keyboard Viewer in order to map said function to it! It doesn't show up anywhere, and pressing it gives no identifying feedback/input…\nAny thoughts? Admittedly a very minor 'issue' but you know, one of those ones that, like an ear-worm, just won't leave me alone!\nThe keyboard in question is an Emprex 6310u (see the moon?):\n \n\nA: [Facepalm] Press and hold the key, that's how. I guess it's a 'hold' so as to avoid lighter presses/brushes? \nSo much for my first question on AskDifferent…\nThanks me! You're welcome, me!\n", "Q: Excel for Mac 2011 calculation results equaling zero are formatting as a positive zero value instead of zero suppressed zero? I am having a very frustrating problem with zero values in a conditional calculation.\nI have a running balance column (E) with the custom number format of #,##0.00 ; [Red]-#,##0.00 ; ;  when I use the simple calculation in the cells ie. E4 is =E3+D4, and the result is zero, the zeros are suppressed.  The problem came when I changed it to a conditional calculation to avoid any cell results in future rows.  The new formula being =if(A1>today(),,E3+D4), where A1 is every week day of the year.\nThe cells containing zero results prior to any values in D cells are working (not displaying zeros), but once the running balance column E was not equal to zero and then calculated back to zero, that cell and the cells after carrying a zero balance are displayed as 0.00\nI have done many alterations to the format and formula to figure out why and all I can come up with is that the zero is being taken as a positive zero instead of just zero. (I formatted positives as blue and the 0.00 was blue)\nWhen I change the formula back to straight addition (the same as in the conditional formula), the zeros are suppressed again.\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going in with this?\n\nA: Unfortunately, without a sample spreadsheet, we need to start with a debugging exercise-- is this a formatting problem or a formula problem?  Here's one way to approach the debugging. \n\n\n*\n\n*Set up an \"indicator\" or verification cell formula to verify:  is the running balance cell equal to Zero (TRUE or FALSE)? Is it greater than Zero (again, TRUE or FALSE)?    If you can verify that the value, displayed as \"0.00\" is in fact greater than zero -- you can trace why you have a formula leaving you with a very small value and not zero.  (You may have a very small rounding error, e.g. add 1/3 and subtract 0.33 -- balance is non-zero.)\n\n*If the cell check confirms the  cell is equal to Zero, yet is being formatted incorrectly:  tackle the in-cell formatting followed by the conditional formatting (if any). \nFirst, check carefully your custom number-formatting string.  Reset your formatting string to a \"known good\" string -- the generic ones provided in the Format:Numbers box.\nFinally, check conditional formatting by breaking down to one (1) condition at a time to isolate the condition which isn't working.  \n", "Q: How to change the default format in Numbers?

I have a PC with shared folders on 2 separate external drives. I can successfully access the share on one of the drives but I cannot access a share on the second drive. I have tried creating new folders and sharing them and I still get the same results. The message I get when I try to access the problem share is:\n\nThe operation can't be completed because the original item for 'folder name' can't be found.\n\nI can successfully access both shares from another Windows 7 box. \nAnyone have any useful ideas?\n\nA: It may be a Windows sharing or security issue. May be.\nGet properties on the folder you are sharing that is inaccessible. Click the sharing tab > Advanced Sharing and verify the folder is shared. Click on permissions ad verify the \"Everyone\" group has change and read checked under the Allow column. Click OK to get back to properties and click the Security tab. Click the Edit button and then Add. Enter \"Everyone\" in the lower text field and click OK. Back in the Security tab make sure \"Everyone\" is selected and click the checkbox next to \"Full control\" under the Allow Collumn. Click OK.\nIn the share properties we have just added anyone who can connect permission to connect to and make changes to the network share. In the Security properties we did the same thing, but this time we set those permissions on the file system (NTFS permissions)\nGenerally you don't have to set NTFS permissions to access a share but in some cases they may be necessary.\nI am not certain this is the issue, but it could be and it is easy enough to do this to find out.\n", "Q: Why can't I download Safari for Windows from Apple? I'm not asking where or if, I'm asking why can't I.\nIs it not in Apple's interest to make their browser available to Windows and other operating systems?\nI'm asking as a web developer who wants to make sure I'm facilitating Safari users and their browser experience.\nThird party \"freeware\" (read \"bloatware\"/\"malware\") download sites are offering downloads but can I not source the latest browser version directly from Apple?\n\nA: Who says you can't download Safari for Windows? Get it directly from the Apple servers.\nhttp://appldnld.apple.com/Safari5/041-5487.20120509.INU8B/SafariSetup.exe\n\nA: Apple most likely stopped Safari for Windows due to it's small marketshare on Windows and lack of explicit reason to continue it. The browser never had anything special and didn't provide any source of income either. Chrome and Midori both did WebKit on Windows anyway ( at the point of discontinuation ).\nNonetheless they still keep up the WebKit Project with Nightlies( basically Safari ), so if you want a Safari-like experience and the latest features on Windows, I believe building WebKit Nightly would be your best bet : \n\n\n*\n\n*http://nightly.webkit.org\n\n*http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingOnWindows\n", "Q: MacBook Pro took a small tumble has minor scuffs on the right side My MacBook Pro took a small tumble off of my recliner last night and scuffed the right side from the brick of the fireplace. I just took my case off last week because the case was looking pretty bad and of course, as soon as I take it off it falls for the first time. My Macbook has been kept PERFECT and this little scuff really REALLY bothers me. I know its silly, but I'm a perfectionist and can't get over it! Any experience with repairs on this? I'm not expecting it to be fixed for free, but wondering about a price range etc...\n\nA: Nothing you can do without replacing the entire aluminum case, which probably isn't worth the trouble. \n\n\n*\n\n*Since it's cosmetic damage, Apple's warranty won't cover it.\n\n*Maybe if you found a really skilled machinist, they could make it look better. But it would probably mess up the labels on the ports, so not worth it.\n\n\nA: Keyboard, Trackpad, Battery and Topcase is one module, so is the display. So probably driple-digit, close to four-digit. Selling yours and buying a new one would probably even be cheaper.\n", "Q: Dropbox vs Github for dotfiles sync? For the last few years I've been using Dropbox to sync my dotfiles. For zsh, oh-my-zsh, emacs settings etc.\nMore people seem to be using Github for this. What are the advantages and disadvantages in this?\nFrom what I can see, keeping Dropbox in sync is simpler - I don't have to push, pull etc, whenever I change something. On the other hand, my Dropbox folder is pretty large now, so it can take a while to get all my files.\nIn the future, I'd also like to sync some application preferences - like Alfred, Sublime, etc. \nWhat are the situations where one, or the other have a distinct (dis)advantage?\n\nA: I currently don't use github for dotfile syncing but I plan to do it. My reasoning is that I would like to have slightly different configs on different machines. To make that possible, you can basically have a master branch, and seperate branches for each device/device group as needed. If you add something new to the master branch, you can merge it with other customized branches etc. For auto syncing between machines, you could create a script that pulls from remote with an interval, possibly with support of manual pulling.. Easiest way to do that depends on your OS. So in summary, this all comes down to how often you change your configs, if you want to have customized configs for some device groups (e.g. all OSX devices vs all Ubuntu VMs) etc. Finally it's easier to use dotfiles from github than it is from dropbox when you work with machines where you have limited privileges (admin rights for installing Dropbox syncer?)\n\nA: I use GitHub for a few of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It’s where I got the template for a number of dot files\n\n*I forked my dot files install script from a friend on GitHub\n\n*It keeps what I use open for others to use\n\n*I get an “unlimited” history of each file, not just the last 30 days\n\n*I get to sync to several OSs that don’t Dropbox (e.g. FreeBSD)\n\n", "Q: How to find out which photos were made by my iPhone and which were sent via WhatsApp? After a nice holiday I've often taken around 200 photos and 80% was made by myself, 10% was incoming WhatsApp pictures and 10% was some other pictures that ended up on my iPhone. \nI don't even want the WhatsApp pictures automatically backed up by Carousel on my iPhone 6, but unfortunately there is no way to disable that.\nIs there an easy way from my MacBook to filter out the pictures I made myself from the other pictures?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Good picture: http://i.imgur.com/lucv1DD.png\n\n*WhatsApp picture: http://i.imgur.com/GmPHn0Y.png\n\nA: This makes use of the Exif info stored within the JPEG image file, some of which is indexed by Spotlight, however see the Notes: section below.\nHere is a simple sample bash script to preform an action on any JPEG image files found in the working directory that was taken on a iPhone.\nCopy and paste the code below into a plan text file, without an extension, and from a Terminal, make it executable using chmod +x filename where \"filename\" is the name you gave to the script file.  Then place it in a directory that's in your $PATH, e.g /usr/local/bin, otherwise you'll have to provide the fully qualified pathname to the script file on the command line to execute it.\nNow in a Terminal use the cd command to change to the target directory containing the JPEG image files you want to act upon, this becomes the target working directory, and type the name you gave to the script, then press Enter.  It will echo the name of each JPEG image file that was taken on an iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hint: To more easily navigate to the target working directory from within the Terminal, type cd followed by a space then drag and drop from Finder the target folder onto the Terminal window.  This populates the fully qualified pathname for you and then you can just press Enter.  You're now in the target working directory containing the JPEG image files.\n\n\nCode:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in *.jpg *.JPG; do\n    x=\"$(mdls \"$f\" | grep -o 'iPhone')\"\n    if [[ ! -z \"$x\" ]]; then\n        echo \"$f was taken on an iPhone.\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nNow obviously you'll want it to do something other then just echo the name of a JPEG image file that was taken on an iPhone, so you'll have to add additional command(s) within the for ... done loop.\nIn this example I want all JPEG image files that were taken on an iPhone to be moved into a directory name \"iPhone\" within the working directory.  So I modified the script accordingly.\nEdited Code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ ! -d \"iPhone\" ]]; then\n    mkdir \"iPhone\"\nfi\n\nfor f in *.jpg *.JPG; do\n    x=\"$(mdls \"$f\" | grep -o 'iPhone')\"\n    if [[ ! -z \"$x\" ]]; then\n        echo \"$f was taken on an iPhone.\"\n        mv -v \"$f\" \"./iPhone/\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nIn Summary:\nIn the first if ... fi block [[ ! -d \"iPhone\" ]] tests for the existence of the \"iPhone\" directory within the current working directory and if it doesn't already exist, it's created by the mkdir command.\nIn the for ... done loop it only looks at files with extensions .jpg and .JPG. (I have both on my system.)\nThe $x variable will either be empty containing nothing \"\" or \"iPhone\" upon completion of the commands within the \"$(...)\" command substitution.\nThe output of the mdls command for the JPEG image file gets piped | to the grep command looking for iPhone and because of the -o option it's either going to be an empty string or the word \"iPhone\" that's returned, which becomes the content of the $x variable.\nTherefore in the second if ... fi block [[ ! -z \"$x\" ]] tests to see that the \"$x\" variable is not an empty string and when it holds something, in this case being \"iPhone\", it's going to act upon that .jpg or .JPG file.  In the case of $x not being an empty string, as it can only contain nothing or \"iPhone\", it moves that file into the \"iPhone\" directory within the working directory.\nNotes:\nHaving tested this in several locations on both internal and external storage medium I noticed that in some places the files were stored and that while they did actually contain the model of the camera that created them nonetheless it was not reflected in the output of the mdls command as those locations were excluded from indexing by Spotlight. So using the, third-party supplied, exiftool command insured reading the information directly from the file itself and not relying on indexed information (or lack of indexed information) that the mdls command accesses.\nSo if you want to download and install ExifTool and use it, then change mdls to exiftool in the x=\"$(mdls \"$f\" | grep -o 'iPhone')\" line of the script so it would look like x=\"$(exiftool \"$f\" | grep -o 'iPhone')\".\nIn comparison on the same JPEG image file the exiftool command showed the values of 23 additional Tags that were not displayed by the mdls command.  This may provide additional info to programmatically make the decision how to absolutely differentiate the source of the files by adding additional code to the script that would use info in the additional Tags, if necessary.\n", "Q: Small business using iPads needs to allow access to documents stored on office computer I am currently running a small business with Sales people and installers. I have issued each one of them an iPad to take with them on consultations. I am currently looking around for a program that would allow all of the iPad users to access product info documents that are stored on our office computer. But here is the kicker… I want the files to automatically upload to the devices when they return to the office, but I don't want the installers to receive files related to sales, and I don't want the sales people to receive files related to the installers. \nI was trying to do some research on how iCloud works, but everything I was able to find was quite vague. I've also thought about drop box, but again I'm not confident that it can do what I'm looking to do. \nIs there anything out there that will function the way I need?\n\nA: I would use Dropbox for this, creating separate repositories for Sales and Installers. \nAny changes made on each device will sync back to DropBox, and any changes on DropBox will sync back to the individual devices. \nMy business does this very thing with Marketing, and Sales. \nThe one thing I see as an issue is that any changes will sync immediately, not based upon location (i.e., \"when they return to the office.\")\n\nA: QPulse or some other document management system.\nIf you value your data, there is never a good reason to use Dropbox.

Is it safe? Will it somehow mess with the efi/bootcamp settings so boot up problems might ensue?\n\nA: I updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on a MacBook Pro 15 inch Retina 2013.\nBest is not to do a clean install but choose to upgrade the existing OS, Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. This will avoid a lot of problems with the authentication key you need for Windows 10 and the necessary drivers.\nWindows 10 will use the Bootcamp Windows 8. 1 drivers which are already installed on your PC. They all work ok except for the bluetooth driver.\nIt is installed but bluetooth doesn't show up. That's the only problem I had with upgrading to Windows 10.\n\nA: My problem was I answered \"Don't keep any personal settings and data\" when Windows 10 installer asked what to keep and then it deleted all of the Apple drivers including Bootcamp. So my bluetooth, the sound driver and a couple of other devices were not installed and no matter how hard I try I couldn't get them installed. Make sure you would choose \"keep everything\" \n\nA: I made a clean install on my MacBook Air using Bootcamp. I created a bootable USB with Bootcamp. Process was smooth. Downloaded image from Microsoft, showed image to Bootcamp and showed the USB stick to be used.\nI installed insider preview but doubt there are any differences.

Can anyone help me?\n\nA: If an iPhone is off, and you connect it to a power source (either a charger or computer), it will always turn on. !!!\nIf that is not working then something more serious is going on. Bring it in for repair.\nJust in case it is locked-up, try holding the Home button for 30 seconds, but that might be a fruitless exercise.\n", "Q: iPhone 5S and iPad 4 I purchased 20 GB extra of storage for my iPad and iPhone on iCloud. But my devices say they are still full. How do I get the storage to show up so I can download an update, apps etc.? \n\nA: You bought extra cloud storage, not extra phone/pad memory [which is not possible].\nThe two are utterly unrelated. \nYou need to transfer some data to a computer, or delete it, to free up extra space on the devices.\n", "Q: Transfer SSD from MacBook Pro 2009 to MacBook Pro 2012 I'm upgrading from a MacBook Pro  to a 2012 model. I installed a SSD drive on the 2009 unit. A few days ago, I got the black screen of death due to the logic board failing.

How to recover without necessarily doing a restore? I noticed that anything before near the beginning of this month all the way to the end of June last year is just gone.  There are plenty of messages before all that, but the parts of conversations during that period simply no longer exist.\nOne problem is that I can't find the chat.db file, Attachments folder or other stuff in Library/Messages from shortly before that period.  (I had to head to work, so I didn't get much of a chance to look at even earlier periods.)\nI don't necessarily need it in iMessage format, if the SMS messages with attachments are available through an iPhone backup.  I do not need the stuff to be re-inserted into iMessages necessarily and I don't want to lose the messages that have happened since the beginning of this month either; I just want be able to keep the old ones.\nNormally, I'd have waited until I got home and to mess with it, but I guess I'm just a bit panicked; there's a lot of stuff that gets talked about over a year and I very much want it back.\n(There is a Time Capsule, but honestly, I have never actively used it so I'm not sure how to work it.)\n\nA: Time Capsule would only help if you regularly backed up your iPhone to iTunes. Long term, I would recommend using a tool to export SMS messages to a durable format. \nPhoneView for Mac does that by managing a parallel database of messages on your Mac and you can export them as PDF just in case.\n", "Q: how do I upgrade my processor on my MacBook Air? I am trying to download a piece of equipment which requires at least a 1.8 Ghz processor. My MacBook Air has only 1.7 Ghz. Is it possible to upgrade it?\n\nA: You don't. Mobile processors aren't necessarily made to be replaceable - often, they are soldered directly onto the logic board itself. Aside from the obvious voided warranty/extreme risk of damage to the board, you would need to either try the software for download to see if it'll actually run on your machine regardless of specs, or you will need to purchase a new laptop.\n\nA: Sorry, the MacBook Air processor is soldered on and removing it would likely destroy the logic board. If you're looking for a powerful, yet relatively cheap laptop, get a used few-year-old MacBook Pro on eBay for a few hundred dollars (nothing too old, 2011 probably at the latest).\n\nA: It’s almost certain you don’t have to strictly honor any GHz requirement or guideline and we can help you optimize your app without needing to swap logic boards or upgrade your Mac.\nLet’s get a follow on question if needed with specifics. What software package on what specific version of macOS .\nThe proper answer is “most Macs have a set processor / memory combination and upgrading them is far more costly than other more effective and more convenient options.”\nThink of your Mac like a car engine, most people don’t need to bore out the cylinders to get more power out of commodity vehicles. Some people actually do this and customize their engine, but it’s not worth the training and expense in most cases.\n\nA: You can't replace a mac's processor. You can only replace processors in custom-built desktop pc's, when you replace the motherboard either. But let's get into the macbook air discussion, considering you can't replace the CPU...\nThere is an option to speed up your macbook's processor, you just have to go to about this mac -> and you will directly see your mac's specs. Copy the name of your mac's model (for example: \"MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2019)\") by selecting it with your mouse pointer and click command + C. Now google this name by clicking Command + V once you clicked the search bar.\nOnce you click enter, there will appear a webpage from apple support. Open this web page. There will be a little text about your processor. Does this text contain \"turbo boost\"? Then your mac supports speeding your CPU up using turbo boost! Check out the internet and read about turbo boost. Then speed your CPU up to what's necessary. NOTE: !!!this might affect your battery's life and the temperature your CPU gets to do with!!!\nHopefully this was helpful. Sorry that it's a bit late, but I'll just hope it can still help out other people.\n\nA: Logic boards from 2013–2015 Macbook Airs are interchangeable, so if you have one of those models, you could swap your board with one from a newer or faster Macbook Air of the same size.\nHowever, you'd be replacing the bulk of the computer's internals, so this rarely makes sense. You'd be better off selling your current laptop and buying a newer one.\nIn my case, I had a Macbook Air with my name engraved on the cover, so the swap made economical sense. (Even then, I had a repair shop do the swap for me, but I believe it's a moderately easy thing to do if you're more handy than I am.)\n\nA: I remember that in the old days it was possible to fake change the CPU (through the terminal) in order for the OSX to report a faster CPU so that some software could be installed?\nMaybe you could look into that? It will not give you a faster machine but might make install the software!\n\nA: Upgrade processor by purchasing replacement board if you have 1.8 4gig; you buy 2.0 8gig and install. \n", "Q: How do I get the actual ip address of a printer in OSX Yosemite I need to know the ip address of my printer from OSX to be able to configure it in my daughters Windows laptop. I tried the solution suggested in How do you get a printer's IP in lion? but I only get: dnssd://AL-CX11-08F61E._printer._tcp.local./auto, and I cannot ping AL-CX11-08F61E._printer._tcp.local. because it does not resolve. Still, I can print. How do I get the actual IP address?\nEdit: why doesn't it resolve from the commandline, but still OSX can print?\n\nA: There is a tool Bonjour Browser which will show you the connected devices on the current network.  The connection types are sorted, and you can usually find the printers in Print Spooler (_printer._tcp.) or Internet Printing Protocol (_ipp._tcp.) sections.  Each device will list its IP address, among other information.\n\nA: Open the Terminal application in Applications/Utilities\ntype\nlpstat -s\n\nFollowed by pressing return. You should see a list of all your installed printers. In a common setup, printers have been setup using the Line Printer Daemon protocol. If that's the case where you are, the number after lpd:// is the IP address.\nUnless you are using a print server, in which case you’ll see the print server’s fully qualified domain name there.\n\nA: All modern networkable printers (which have a display) have an option to set and display the IP address. Often times you hold the \"go button\" down for 15 seconds, or while powering up the printer. Sometimes you need a utility that goes with the printer to set and/or view it.

But I seem to fail when trying to do it with Safari.\nMy understanding is that Safari's cookie files are in\n/Users/me/Library/Cookies\n\nThere are at least four files there:\nHSTS.plist\ncom.apple.appstore.cookies\ncom.apple.ibooks.cookies\nCookies.binarycookies\n\nI have closed Safari and emptied the folder. However, it doesn't seem to have worked because when I visit a website that uses cookies for user authentication, I am still logged in (which does not happen when I do it with Chrome or FireFox).\n\nA: I don't understand the full interplay, but rebooting will fix cookie retention [presumably held in cache] - that is separate from login details remembered by Keychain & also Form Values etc.\nIf you really want a clean sweep, try OnyX (free/donationware) > Cleaning > Internet - choose what you need to delete from there…\n\nSafari has its own simpler version, though I'm not certain quite what it does delete…\n\n\nA: Not sure if I fully understand your question, but if you are looking for a way to remove all cookies from Safari via the terminal, without having them regenerated the next time you launch Safari: try the shell script posted below. (I copied this answer from my original post here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/273442/201104.)\nI tested this on macOS 10.12.3 and Safari 10.0.3 and it works. \nWarning: The tests I did weren't as thorough, meaning: some of the files deleted by this script might not actually be necessary in order to achieve the removal of the cookies, you should trial-and-error your way around it to narrow it down if you like.

(spinning wheel) I have set up an AirPort Express Base Station (June 2012 model, the current one). For setup, I used a Yosemite MacBook Pro over Ethernet. The AirPort Express has an Ethernet running from the WAN port to a CLEAR modem (a WiMAX service) in \"Bridged\" mode.\nBoth the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks work well, devices connect with password and surf the web. \nThe third network, the Guest network, does not let any client connect. I've tried both the MacBook Pro, an iPhone 5, and a MacBook Air repeatedly, power cycled, and so forth. When they attempt to join the password is accepted but the spinning wheel never stops and the computer/device never finishes joining the network. We can switch back to either the 2.4 or 5 network instantly with no problems.\nAny suggestions? Might Bridged mode be a problem with a Guest account?\n\nA: The problem is the bridge mode:\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nThe DHCP and NAT option in AirPort Utility application > Network tab > Router Mode (default mode) must be selected on your primary base station (…)\n\nIf you had more than one Airport, all secondary stations must have Bridge mode on, given there is one Airport or Time Capsule working as the primary station.\n", "Q: How can I find conflicting keyboard shortcuts?

Again, lets assume that I no longer want to support an app and that I am removing the app from the app store. \nIf my app no longer works or functions correctly after dropping support, is there a way I can suggest deleting the app or are their penalties for having apps that behave this way?\n\nA: You should sign into your Apple Developer Account and review the License Agreements there.\n\nLicense Agreements\nThe license agreements of the iOS Developer Program and Mac Developer Program detail your obligations and responsibilities as a member. The latest agreements can be reviewed in Member Center.\nSign in to Member Center\n\nFrom the looks of it though, it is pretty generic protect Apple and Apple's Brand and Good Will. If you received any additional agreements when your app was approved to go on the App Store, then review them as well.\nFrom the looks of it though, and from wha articles in trade publications indicate, many developers just walk away from their apps.\nAs it sounds like you are trying to do the right thing, hypothetically of course, I do recall that one app that I had, Catch Notes, did post a notice to their landing page on the App Store that their product was no longer going to be supported. If you are able to make updates or adds to the page, then that is likely the place to do it. Also Catch Notes no longer appears on the App Store, so there is some process for removal.\nHere are some news reports that made the tech sites.\nEngadget\nCNET\nTechcrunch\nCheck with an Apple representative. There may be a way that the app can be frozen from future downloads, to allow sufficient time for the app's page to be seen by the current user base without expanding it. It is also possible that they are able to message your user base through their records of the App Store purchases. If there is security risk and you feel that the users should completely remove the app, then this is the right thing to do.\n\nA: OneNote by Microsoft did something clever when they discontinued their iPad-only app: they changed the app icon to include an exclamation mark in an update and when you opened it it gave you a message that there was a new version, with a link.\nSo maybe you can change the app icon as well but instead of a new version link you can just suggest deletion.\n", "Q: Formatted XML display in Safari 8 I'm trying to find an extension or plugin that allows Safari to display XML in a more user friendly form, similar to how its handled by Firefox.\nThe only relevant information seems to be heavily outdated and not applicable to the latest version (8.0.7).\nHow can I view the raw XML of an RSS feed in Safari (or Reeder)? had an answer about 'XV XML Viewer', but the answer itself has been updated pointing out that it no longer works in Safari 5.1.\nThere is also an older .webplugin that could have been used, but then I read that the .webplugin mechanism itself is deprecated and no longer used in modern versions.\nIs there any updated extension that can show a formatted xml view in current Safari versions? The ability to collapse/expand nodes would be nice, but atleast basic formatting would still be better than just a giant blob of text whenever I view a web service from Safari instead of Firefox.\n\nA: You do not need an extension or plugin. What you should do is supply an appropriate XSL. The browser will use this to format the XML for display. See http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/default.asp for more information. \n", "Q: Can't close tabs on browsers using middle-click unless the browser has focus I have just recently acquired a Mac Pro 3.1 and have been a strictly Windows/Linux guy my whole life. But I'm really liking Mac and starting to get used to it.\nI imagine that I'll be on this stackexchange a bit more in the near future, and so I had one basic question to get started.\nBasically, as the title says, when my browser doesn't have focus e.g. chrome/safari in the background while using iMessage, I can't move my mouse over a tab and middle click to close a tab, which I was used to being able to do in windows. The middle click does work to close tabs when the browser has focus. Obviously, this is a very minor issue, and I was just wondering as to whether or not this is supposed to happen.\nAnother little issue is that I can't middle click and drag or middle click then move mouse to scroll on pages and I was wondering if there is another function for that or if it's my mouse (Asus Reign of Gaming mouse from my PC).\nAny help/advice is appreciated! Thanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately, I'm afraid you're out of luck here. OSX never gives focus to a window unless you left-click on it or Cmd-Tab to it. There were some older solutions that could provide focus-follows-mouse, though they're not supported in the newest versions of OSX.\nSadly, middle-clicking non-focused Chrome tabs used to close them. But I believe this feature was lost once Mavericks came out. You can middle-click on some other apps (like Terminal), and they'll respond appropriately. But no browser seems to do so.\nAs for your question about using middle-click-and-drag to scroll, that's something I dearly miss from Windows, but I haven't found a free way to get it on Chrome in OSX (it works in Firefox, though). Smart Scroll is an app that offers \"Vector Scroll\", which works like the feature we want. But it costs $15.\n", "Q: Can't re-enable FileVault after growing `system` partition I recently disabled FileVault in order to grow my system partition.  This ended up being rather more complicated than expected, but it worked out in the end.\nNow that I have resized the system partition, I want to re-encrypt my drive, but I'm getting this error when I attempt to engage FileVault:\nFileVault can't be turned on for the disk \"system\".\n\nSome disk formats don't support the recovery partition required by encryption.\nTo use encryption, reinstall this version of Mac OS X on a reformatted disk.\n\nThis is strange, since the disk has a recovery partition — it was actually moved by Disk Utility in the process of growing the system partition.

Apparently Disk Utility decided to change the partition type of my ext4 partition without consulting me.  What a jerk.\nEDIT: just noticed this related question.  Not exactly the same, since that person is not trying to do full-disk encryption.\n\nA: I decided to streamline the partitioning scheme as much as possible.  I deleted my leading, unused partition, but this still didn't make it go.\nSomehow the partition type of the EFI partition had gotten changed, so I decided to fix that.  There doesn't seem to be any obvious way to do this from within OSX, so I rebooted off of a live Ubuntu boot image on a USB drive.  I used gdisk to set the type of the EFI partition to EF, and confirmed that this had also correctly changed its GUID to the correct one for that partition type.\nFor some reason, under linux the names of the EFI and Recovery partitions had disappeared, so I set them back to the names shown above.  I also confirmed that there was a FAT32 filesystem on the EFI partition.  Apparently the EFI filesystem is technically a different one from FAT32 but I left it as it was.\nAnd it worked!  When I booted back to OSX, I ran Verify on the disk in Disk Utility, which recommended that I run Repair due to some \"corruption\" in the Recovery Partition, or perhaps just with its header.  I ran Repair, which reported success, and was then able to initiate full-disk FileVault encryption.\n", "Q: How to change chart colors in Pages 5? I cannot change the individual colors in my charts. Under \"Chart Colors\" there is only this list of 12 predefined color swatches called \"fill sets\". Most of them are ugly. Not being able to change individual colors means no ability to add the company's brand colors to documents and that sort of thing. How can I change the colors of my chart?\n\nA: I figured it out! One must click on an individual point on the graph or chart and then go to the Style tab under Fill and change that. It will change the color for all the data points in that column.\nNot intuitive at first, but definitely easy once you know about it.\n", "Q: Why can't I type lower case 'a' in Safari when entering text in a field? If I open Safari and go to www.google.com and type in a search the letter 'a' can't be typed.  I have to press shift+a in order to type a capital letter a but can't type a lower case 'a'.  I'm typing this message in Firefox so clearly the key on my keyboard is functioning correctly.  \nI can type lower case a in the url bar area but not in other text boxes.  I can't type it on apple.stackexchange.com or on duckduckgo.com.  No text areas on any website seem to let me type lower case a.  However, it works fine when I use Firefox.  \nAny thoughts?  I'm using OS X 10.10.4 and Safari 8.0.7.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem, and after disabling extensions and restarting Safari it went away.  I then looked more closely and found that I had set the letter lowercase-a as the keyboard shortcut to allow flash in ClickToFlash.  Apparently this made it not work as a character in any text boxes in Safari!  I now have all the extensions back on but without that key shortcut, and everything is working fine!\nBTW, this is clearly a bug in ClickToFlash, since the default key to make flash full-screen is lowercase-f, but I can type that fine in any text box.\n\nA: I uninstalled all extensions in Safari and the problem went away.  I've not re-installed 2 of the 3 extensions I had and the problem has not come back.  Possibly there is something wrong with AdBlock Plus.\n\nA: I had the same issue with lower case p on my mac and then when googling and saw elsewhere reference to keyboard shortcuts in the Accessibility prefs, the light went on.  I had installed Telestream Screenflow (screen capture) the default keyboard command to pause recording was something esoteric and hard to remember so I changed it to 'p' assuming that was only for when Screenflow was the active app.  Nope. Disabling that in Screenflow fixed my 'broken' lower case p\n", "Q: Wi-Fi hardware not installed I've a late 2008 MBP. It's worked fine up until Monday when the wifi stopped working.

If that doesn't work, remove the card, clean the contacts on the card and then reinstall it. If that doesn't work, you'll need to buy a new card, specific for your model of MacBook Air.\n\nA: It could be just that the Yosemite is not recognizing your Airport card -WiFi function due to the bad setup.\nJust to confirm, the Ethernet and Bluetooth are working.\nTo check, open the About this Mac and look in Networks for information, showing your hardware and drivers and more.

(apps updated to support iOS 8.3 or iOS apps or other ways...)\nI don't want to jailbreak.\n\nA: In iOS 8.3, Apple revoked the user's ability to access a downloaded app's files (Documents & Data). Further, third party apps don’t natively provide a way to delete their \"Documents & Data\". It's an inconvenient feature in the OS, yet it exists, even from the beta stages.\nHowever, in an attempt to defend Apple, this could have been an extra security measure to prevent users from hacking apps. Another possibility is that the cleaning apps you mentioned are simply not up-to-date with the new OS.\nSadly, you will have to delete the app off of your iDevice, and reinstall it, to remove any app data. You can do this either from the iDevice itself, or using iTunes on a computer.\nYou could jailbreak your iDevice which would give you access to multiple cleaning tools, but a jailbreak could be difficult to keep up with. You also don't want to accidentally mess with something serious.\nIt's a sad but certain truth that apps must be removed and reinstalled. Good luck!\n\nA: I'm not sure if it may help much, but I tried using an app called, Battery Doctor. I just started using this app because I was annoyed with my storage mostly consists of \"Other\" files. \nI'm also PhoneExpander user and not a jailbreak lover ether! Good luck! \n\nA: You will need to jailbreak and use something like iCleaner.\nhttps://ib-soft.net\n\nA: Currently I'm running iOS 8.4 and iBrowse has been functioning without jailbreaking all along.\nI just visited their website and they even announced iOS 9 support!\n\nA: In order to improve security, Apple made a huge action since iOS 8.3: in the document of About the security content of iOS 8.3, it's clearly pointed out the limitation of sandbox profile. Previously only writing was blocked in executable directory, but now Apple totally kills the app sandbox access. Thus, all the third party apps, which are based on accessing system files inside other apps, come to an overall standstill. I also use clean-up apps(iMyfone Umate), but it hasn't a similar situation like you, except for cleaning up third party apps data. So I think it doesn't stop working. Only when these clean-up apps access some special data on iOS 8.3 or later, they won't be permitted.\nIf you don't want to remove and reinstall apps or jailbreak, what you need to do is clean up cache and junk files by manual in settings.\n", "Q: Absolute path to an application executable in OS X I know where to find the executable file path to an app in Windows.

How can I open application URLs in Terminal or Alfred?\nMy Problem:\nI use Airmail2 as default mail client as well as OmniFocus 2 to organize my work. Airmail2 allows to copy application URLs via EDIT→Copy Message Link, which yields a link like airmail://message?mail=myAccount&messageid=etPan.55ba060a....\nWhen I paste this link in the notes section of a task in OmniFocus, it gets automatically converted into a clickable link that works as expected. Other programs, such as Evernote, will not recognize it as URL. It would be really handy to access these links even outside of OmniFocus.\nHow can I open these application URLs besides pasting it into an OmniFocus task note section and click it? I would prefer a Terminal command or a script, which I can include in Alfred. The open command of the Terminal does not work unfortunately.\n\nA: Maybe I don't get the question right but:\nYou may open such an application URL in almost any available application with text fields or text boxes: highlight the URL (sometimes even only parts of it - at least the scheme and the first character after the :// (e.g. airmail://m - are sufficient to open the application), right-click and choose \"Open URL\". And yes, it's of course also working in the Chrome/Safari Omnibar: Just enter the URL and hit the \"Enter\" key.\nIn Evernote you have even two ways to open it: \n\n\n*\n\n*You may paste the URL(s) in a note and by choosing the whole URL or parts of it the context menu offers \"Open URL\"\n\n*If you have only one application URL in your note, you may add the URL to the \"Note info\" (red circle) and then you'll get a clickable link with the \"scheme specific part\" of the URL or only parts of the \"scheme specific part\" - here \"message\" (blue circle). \n\nIn the Terminal you have several ways to open the URL:\n\n\n*\n\n*highlight the whole URL or parts of it and the context menu offers \"Open URL\"\n\n*highlight the whole URL and command & double click it\n\n*enter open URL\n(e.g. open airmail://message?mail=myAccount&messageid=etPan.55ba060a....)\n(OK, the interaction between Terminal and Airmail2 uncovers a glitch, because Airmail2 opens if closed, gets to the front and the message is chosen, but the GUI is not visible.)\n\n", "Q: irritating window locations after a closed clam I switch back and forth, frequently, between 'closed clam' with a large monitor and 'just the laptop monitor' with a Retina MBP.\nWhenever I switch, all my windows appear in unhelpful locations sticking off the edges of the visible screen.

They look like DATE######.m4a.\nI'm working with these memos, any solution would fit, even jailbreak I really need to find a way.\niTunes 12.2.1.16, Windows 7, iPhone 3Gs, iOS 6\n\nA: I had over 700 voice memos in my iPhone, many of which I renamed to make it easier to find the ones I need in the records.\nTo solve the problem of moving records to my file system keeping file names, I found this workaround for myself. I describe it step by step.\n\n\n*\n\n*Synchronize with iTunes and get a playlist with records.\n\n*Go to the playlist and go File → Library → Export playlist and save txt file.\n\n*Open the file in the Notepad++ and press Ctrl+A to select all text, press Tab once to get spaces in the beginning of each line.\n\n*Delete first line, containing column names.\n\n*Go to Edit → Columns Editor, in the opened window select the \"numbers to insert\" starting from 0 with increasing by 1 and the decimal system, press ok - it will include numbering of lines.\n\n*Press Ctrl+F and go to the replacement tab, then turn on the use of regular expressions\nChange\n^(\\d*)\\s*([^\\t]*)\\t([^\\t]*\\t){29}[^\\t\\n]*\\\\([^\\t\\n\\\\]*).*$\n\nto\nset memoNames[$1]=\"$2.m4a\"\\nset memoLocations[$1]=\"$4\"\n\n(maybe the regex to replace depends on the version of iTunes because it is made according to the columns in export file)\nThe result should be something like this\nset memoNames[0]=\"my custom name.m4a\"\nset memoLocations[0]=\"20130327 172842.m4a\"\nset memoNames[1]=\"some other custom name.m4a\"\nset memoLocations[1]=\"20130327 172954.m4a\"\n\nand so on (total number of lines is count of your voice memos × 2)\n\n*Next, create a batch file (for example rename_records.bat) with content with this code\n@echo off\nsetlocal EnableDelayedExpansion\n#INSERT_HERE_YOUR_REPLACED_DATA#\nset \"x=0\"\necho starting renaming loop\ntimeout 2\n:RenameLoop\nif defined memoNames[%x%] (\n    set nameFrom=!memoLocations[%x%]!\n    set nameTo=!memoNames[%x%]!\n    call echo renaming #%x% %nameFrom% in %nameTo%\n    REM ren %%memoLocations[%x%]%% %%memoNames[%x%]%%\n    set /a \"x+=1\"\n    GOTO :RenameLoop\n)\necho Total length of files is %x%\npause\n\n\n*Replace #INSERT_HERE_YOUR_REPLACED_DATA# in your bat file with the result of 6 step\n\n*If you have cyrillic symbols add this line at the beginning of your bat file\nchcp 1251 >nul\n\n\n*Note: Before running your bat file copy your records from iTunes library to some other folder to be sure that you won't lose your records.\n\n*Place your bat file in the folder that you made in 10 step and run it.\n\n\nA: It appears that this could be a long-standing bug in iTunes. I noticed that if you edit the Voice Memo's metadata via \"Get Info\" before exporting it out of iTunes, that ONLY edited metadata fields remain in-tact when you export and open the file elsewhere or in iTunes again. I filed a bug report with Apple, but until then we have some options.\nHere's 2 workarounds:\n1.) EASIEST - If you don't care about retaining the Voice Memo's timestamp:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all the voice memos you want to export.\n\n*Open Get Info, go to the Options tab.\n\n*Change the 'Media Kind' from \"Voice Memo\" to \"Music\".\n\n*Export the voice memos.\n\n\nThis will rename the file as if it were a song, and the filename will be the \"Name\" metadata. The timestamp data will be lost, however if you convert the original non-exported item back to \"Voice Memo\" it will somehow restore the original filename with the timestamp.\n2.) MOST accurate - To retain all metadata\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the item in \"Get Info\"\n\n*Make a trivial edit to all metadata fields you want to retain. Personally, I just add a space to every \"Name\". For common fields which are the same for multiple voice notes (Artist, Album, Genre), you can do a batch edit.\n\n*Export the voice notes. The filename will be an ugly timestamp (with hexadecimal), but if you open the file elsewhere (or in iTunes again) the metadata you edited before will still be there.\n\n\nA: Syncios is a safer alternative to Tongbu. Unlike iTunes, both provide a simple solution to download voice memos with their titles, providing you watch for the title characters lengths and forbidden characters.\n\nA: I tested the step by step guidance from @Andrew Kozelski with Windows 10 but the batch file didn't rename the files. So I made some fixes and now it works:\n@echo off\nsetlocal EnableDelayedExpansion\n#INSERT_HERE_YOUR_REPLACED_DATA#\necho starting renaming loop\ntimeout 2\n:RenameLoop\nif defined memoNames[%x%] (\n    set nameFrom=!memoLocations[%x%]!\n    set nameTo=!memoNames[%x%]!\n    call echo !memoNames[%x%]!\n    call echo renaming #%x% !nameFrom! in !nameTo!\n    ren !nameFrom! !nameTo!\n    set /a \"x+=1\"\n    GOTO :RenameLoop\n)\necho Total length of files is %x%\npause\n\nIf you need German mutations/Umlaute use chcp 65001 (utf-8 coding) after the @echo off command.\n\nA: Inspired by @Andrew Kozelski's approach, I created a UNIX shell script oneliner that achieves a similar result. This might be useful if like me you run iTunes and Windows inside a VM but do everything else in Linux.\n\n\n*\n\n*(Same as the above first two steps on Windows) Get your Voice Memos into a playlist and export it as a text file (say, \"playlist.txt\").\n\n*Drag and drop the files out of the playlist into a Windows Explorer window, creating files with names such as \"20190327 062535.m4a\".\n\n*Over in UNIX-land, run the following command (all one line):\niconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 playlist.txt | tr -d \"\\r\" | awk 'BEGIN {FS=\"\\t\"}; NR>1 {sub(/^.*\\\\/,\"\",$31); sub(/\\.m4a$/,\"\",$31); print \"mv \" \"\\\"\"$31\".m4a\\\" \" \"\\\"\"$31\" \"$1\".m4a\\\"\"}' | sh\nThe result will be all your files renamed with the title added: \"20190327 062535 my title here.m4a\".\nExplanation of the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*iconv is used to convert from UTF-16 to UTF-8, which is a saner encoding for file names.\n\n*tr deletes the CR character, effectively converting the file from DOS line endings to UNIX line endings.\n\n*awk does several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the field separator to tab, as iTunes exports tab-delimited data.\n\n*Skip the first line which is a header\n\n*Extract the 31st field (which is the full path that iTunes uses to store the file), and remove everything up to and including the last backslash to get the basename of the file, by substituting it with the empty string. Note the backslash is escaped once (\\\\), not twice (\\\\\\), as it needs escaping from awk's use as an escape character, but not from bash's, as the whole awk command is wrapped in single quotes.\n\n*Also strip the \".m4a\" suffix as we'll add it back on later.\n\n*print a command line which uses the mv command to move (rename) the file.\n\n\n*Finally, pipe the result to sh to execute all the rename commands.\n\n\nReplace the final sh with less to inspect the commands before executing them.\nThis could probably be simplified if running within Windows (using Windows Subsystem for Linux) as you could copy directly out of iTunes's repository.\nA massive thank you to Apple for making this process so slick and easy, and I am sure they won't change iTunes's playlist output format in the future because they care so much about backward compatibility and interoperability with other tools.\n\nA: FOR THE SOLUTION SEE THE LAST SENTENCE :))\nI got stuck on step 6 when u click on ‘regular expression’ then changing the “code” to the other “code”. I’m not sure where to edit that but. \nIs it in the ‘find what:’  and ‘replace with:’ column ?\nAnyway when I exported my playlist to text. I noticed the title column had appeared. And it has the names of the files as u have saved them on your iPhone!\nSo it does exist. Just not in the conventional way. \nIf you’re not sure. Right click on one of the columns and select ‘Title’ and the file names will appear. \nBe aware that ‘Date’ & ‘Date modified’ are both the same and are the dates when u last edited it in anyway including the title. \n\nA: When you copy and paste the voice files, the names that you give the files are still present they are just known as ‘title’. To see the titles on a windows PC just open the file location and where it says ‘name’ on the top left of the files listed in that folder, click the right mouse button and select ‘Title’ from the list then the ‘titles’ or names that you called the files should then appear.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcuts Phrases Does iCloud push the \"keyboard shortcuts phrases\" between the iOS and macOS devices?\n\nA: Yes, if you have \"Documents & Data\" checked on iCloud preferences on OS X (since 10.9).\n", "Q: Running shell scripts in single-user mode I'm planning on running a couple of scripts in single-user mode to speed up (and simplify for less savvy users than myself) the configuring of a few aspects of some Macs that I set up for other people.\nI've read the few threads I could find about this, and my question is simply is there anything I should be particularly aware of when it comes to running scripts from single-user mode?\nI'm aware that I can't invoke any commands/apps that would require a GUI to load, and that the /sbin/fsck and /sbin/mount commands would still be required before a script can be run at all.\nTwo more specific questions: If I set the script as executable before depositing it on the disk image that will be booted in single-user mode, will it remain executable? \nAnd lastly, when it comes to removing user accounts I've seen on some threads e.g this one the need to invoke this command:\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist\n\nHowever, as I simply want to rm various files - is there any need to do this, the process seems to work just fine without it?\n\nA: Yes, files flagged as executable will still be executable under Single User Mode.\nopendirectoryd is just for handling logins/authentication and using root doesn't require that, and you don't need to launch it if you just intend to manage files.\n", "Q: AppleScript: Get list of 15 most recent files in directory I need to build a string containing the filenames of the 15 most recent files (by modification date) within a directory.

With that extension you can configure the duration and other stuff.\nIf you want to filter the Notifications, you can use the mail.app Rules.\nFor example for Junk mail make a rule to mark it as read, and it wont show in the notifications.\n\nYou can play with the Mail-Rules for other emails you do not want to see in the Notification (set them as read).\n\nA: On iOS or Mac OS X, use the OS's \"Mail\" app and enable notifications for it in your settings.\nOn Android, mail should show up automatically.\nOn Windows, there is no Notification Center.\nIt would help if you specified what device/OS you were talking about, and the version of it.\n\nA: In order for Chrome(gmail) mail notifications to stick in the OS X notification UI you will need to associate your mail account with the Mail.app.\nThe gmail notification that are showing up in the upper right are dependent on the chrome browser and not leveraging apples os.\nOnce you tie your gmail to the Mail.app, turn on notifications for the mail app account in System preferences.\n", "Q: iOS 8.4 does not update apps I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 8.4\nNever had an issue untile three days ago.\nI went to update some apps from the app store, and it just won't do it. The little circle keeps spinning without ever showing the \"stop button\" next to the app that also shows the download percentage.\nNow I have something like 14 unupdated apps and I can't seem to do anything! I restarted the phone twice but nothing changed.\nWhat to do now?\n\nA: In addition to the answer of DDPWNAGE and user138479 you may try to update directly via the app site and click on \"update\" there instead of using the \"update all\" button in the update tab.\nClick \"App-Store\" ➡️ \"Updates\" ➡️ Click on App Name ➡️ In App Details click on \"Update\"\nAnother option might be to check if there is another download hanging which blocks all of the other updates.\nClick \"App-Store\" ➡️ \"Updates\" ➡️ \"Purchased\" ➡️ Check if any Apps have a running circle hence an update symbol and stop the update.\nOne more option is to connect your iPhone with a PC/MAC and switch it off. After that:\nPress the \"Power\" and \"Home\" Button at the same time for exactly 10 seconds. The iphone switches into DFU mode and kills all the running processes. The display is supposed to be black. If the apple logo shows up a second time, youve pressed the buttons too long. \nAfter the 10 seconds, release the \"Power\" button but remain pressing the \"Home\" button. Your PC/MAC should recognize your iphone and probably install the DFU drivers. After that press the \"Power\" and \"Home\" buttons again for another 20 seconds, which causes the iphone to leave the DFU mode and to restart. \nTry again to update your Apps.\nThose are the solutions I was able to find. Unfortunately for me none of them worked, but maybe you'll be successful.\n\nA: I had the same problem - not being able to update my apps under IOS 8.4.1. It had always worked before, but seemingly that function just randomly stopped working. Internet access was not the problem. DDPWNAGE's answer worked for me - well kind of. When I went to Settings/iTunes & App Store I didn't find a 'log out' option - instead I had a 'sign in' option! Seems that randomly and unrequested, I had been signed out of iTunes without my knowledge. So I signed in again and everything worked as it should once I had restarted the phone.\n\nA: Try logging out of the App Store and logging back in through your phone's settings.\nClick \"Settings ➡️ App Store ➡️ Account ➡️ Sign Out,\" then log back in by typing your iTunes password and click \"Log in.\"\nIt should work fine after that.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my families 3 ipads (2xair, 1xair2, latest IOs 8.4.1) none of the mentioned solutions worked out for me.\nWhat I found out. \nIf I deaktivate automatic screen locking. All apps were updates - but with a speed of 1 MB / Minute or even slower.\nSo, at least I was able to install my sons favorite games ;-)\nHope apple will fix this soon, as we are not alone.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7109869?start=45&tstart=0\nHW\n\nA: I was having same problem - lots of updates that were stuck on waiting, no updates were hung up in purchases area.  And I could not download new apps either, they would stick on the waiting too.  I reset all of my settings and I was able to get dowloads working again.  \n\nA: I had a similar problem with my iPhone 6 on iOS 8.3. No applications would update, and I could not install new applications either. \nToday I found the culprit; the Podcasts application had several episodes in the download queue, but there was apparently a problem with the feed or something. Once I canceled every episode download in the Podcast application, my other applications started updating as normal.\n\nA: I resolved my problem by updating the iOS to the latest (9.3.1) & everything starts updating again. I am also able to download new apps again. \n\nA: Reset your network config. You'll lose any saved wifi passwords\n", "Q: Internet not working on iPad mini with iOS 7 Since a couple of days internet connected applications (such as facebook) have stopped working on my wife's iPad mini which has iOS 7.1.2.\nFurther symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*internet works in Safari\n\n*internet doesn't work in Facebook (though it works with the messenger component), the app store, Dropbox\n\n*trying to install updates fails (seems to time out, doesn't even start downloading)\n\n*tried to sign out from the Apple account (Settings -> iTunes & App store) and sign back in, however it won't let me sign in (tried multiple times and confirmed that the account details are correct by signing in on a PC)\n\n*tried rebooting multiple times to no avail\n\n\nAny ideas what could be done? I will try to connect it to a PC having iTunes later to see if can help - also will try to update it to iOS 8.4 (hopefully it's possible to do so without being signed in to the apple account).\n\nA: I solved it - turns out the problem was a flaky internet connection! The clue was that I was unable to sign in to iTunes on my Windows laptop (the connection was timing out), even though I could do the same on my Linux laptop.\nI rebooted the router and then was able to sign in to the iCloud account from the iPad and everything started working. I also updated it to iOS 8.4 just in case :-)\n", "Q: Do I need the DVD to reformat 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X Yosemite I have a MacBook Pro from early 2011 which was shipped to me with a DVD that I could use to reformat the machine, which I do not have with me at the moment.  I have upgraded to OS X Yosemite though, and have reformatted the newer Retina MacBooks which used an Internet connection to download the OS.\nSince I do not have the disc handy, will I be able to do this later reformatting on my older MacBook Pro? \n\nA: If your MacBook Pro (early 2011) was updated with Macbook Pro EFI Firmware Update 2.3 then you will be able to use OS X Internet Recovery and not need the DVD that shipped with your Mac.  Also have a look at: OS X: About OS X Recovery\n", "Q: Resizing a 100GB Recovery HD Partition Some time ago, I used BootCamp to set up a partition for Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro (13\" late 2014 if it matters) so I could dual-boot. I have since removed the partition using BootCamp, but still can't reclaim the disk space.\nThe new Disk Utility doesn't show the partition (I'm using the 10.11 Public Beta, but have also checked in the Recovery partition which is still using the old Yosemite Disk Utility).\nHowever, the diskutil Terminal command shows this:\ncwatson@ragnarok:~$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            398.6 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             101.5 GB   disk0s3\n\nIt seems the resize has screwed up somewhere, and made the Recover HD over 100GB.\ncwatson@ragnarok:~$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nPassword:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6\n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  778422104      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  778831744  198273280      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  977105024          3\n  977105027         32         Sec GPT table\n  977105059          1         Sec GPT header\n\nIs there any way of (safely) resizing this back down to something sensible, so I can reclaim the space?\n\nA: If it hadn't been 10.11 Public Beta (2) on the main volume, I would have advised to boot to Internet Recovery Mode (IRM) (altcmdR) or a bootable thumb drive (BTD), just delete the 3rd partition with gpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0 and fully expand the main partition with Disk Utility. After rebooting to the main volume I would have reinstalled the latest OS X (Yosemite 10.10.4 as of this writing) which recreates the Recovery HD while preserving all non-Apple apps and user-created data.\nInstead you have to dd the Recovery HD from a second Mac running Yosemite. Copy the resulting file to the first Mac. Then boot Mac1 to IRM/BTD, delete the 3rd partition with gpt, reboot to IRM/BTD, resize the main volume with diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 size, create a 3rd partition with: \n gpt add -b first_freeblock -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nand finally dd the previously made copy of Recovery HD (Mac2) back to /dev/dis0s3.\nTo get size in diskutil ... size you have to do some math considering that the last blocks of a Yosemite drive containing the Recovery HD usually look like this:\n....                      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n975503592    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n976773128          7         \n976773135         32         Sec GPT table\n976773167          1         Sec GPT header\n\nRecheck this with sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 on Mac2.\nThe example here is a 500.1 GiB (976773168 blocks à 512 B) disk.  \nAccordingly \"size\" has to be smaller than or the same size as (total blocks - 409640 - 1269576 blocks). The second term is block0 - block409639 containing PMBR, the primary GPT header and table and the EFI partition. The third term is the size of the Recovery HD and the secondary GPT header and table. Please consider that block counting starts with 0: block 0 is the the first block or block 975503592 is the 975503593rd block.\nIf you are to lazy to do the math, you may first create the third partition and dd the Recovery HD file and then - after a restart - expand the main volume using Disk Utility.\n\nA second more risky method (not risky regarding your data on the main volume but I'm not sure if it is successful) is just moving the partition borders of disk0s3. This method presumes that no files of the old Recovery HD were moved \"physically\" on disk0s3 after deleting the Boot Camp partition with the Boot Camp assistant.\nBoot to IRM/BTD and enter in Terminal:\ngpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0\n\nand reboot to IRM/BTD. Then add a third partition with the following command (already adapted to the size of your disk!):\ngpt add -b 975835488 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nand reboot to IRM/BTD. Open Disk Utility and verify/repair the hard drive (and not the main volume!). Then enlarge the main volume to max size and verify /repair the main volume. Finally try to boot to Recovery Mode (cmdR).\n\nA: Reference\nPrepare a USB disk,\ndiskutil erasedisk jhfs+ Make_Recovery disk3\nsudo asr restore --source /Volumes/Recovery HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg --target /dev/disk0s3 --erase\nsudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk3s2 --settype Apple_Boot`\n\nthen delete Recovery HD partition.\nBesides, you can backup BaseSystem.dmg, and restore to new partition.\n", "Q: Make your iOS device work like an IP-cam? (Remote video watching) I would like to use my iPad to record video (or even taking continuous photos every few seconds would be fine), and while it is recording, i would like to be able to see the video from my iPhone.  \nWhat I'm trying to do is to leave the iPad at home, and take the iPhone outside to watch what the iPad is recording at home.  \nI guess I'm trying to have the iPad work like an ip-surveillance camera.\nI don't necessarily have to use the pre-installed Camera app if there is another app that can do this (the camera app eats up lots of storage space quickly anyways).\nIf anyone know how to do this, please let me know, thanks!\n\nA: I use an app that works pretty well for turning a spare iDevice into a security camera and monitoring that feed on another iDevice. It's called \"Presence\" It's free with IAPs, but I've never paid a dime and it works fine for me. You will need to make an account with them, though.\n", "Q: iOS 8.4 app download problem Whenever I try to download an app it will buffer forever and on my home screen the app will only say waiting. \nWhy is this and what is the solution?\n\nA: I had this problem with Pages. I made a backup of my iPad to iTunes (just in case) and then I deleted the apps from the iPad through iTunes, then I clicked Sync and the apps were gone, then I just reinstalled them through the App Store and they worked again. Strangely, this happened again, but with Pages and Numbers this time and I didn't have enough space on my MacBook to back my iPad up again, so I gave up. Fortunately, when I installed the iOS 9 Public Beta from Apple, both apps were fixed. iOS 9 Public Beta 2 is pretty buggy, so update at your own risk. You may just want to wait until iOS 9 comes out in the fall (probably late-September) if the app is not too important.\n", "Q: Weird problem with file ownership I recently had to move server drives from an OSX 10.6 server to a new Mac mini running Yosemite (10.10.4) and Yosemite server (4.1.3) - meaning I physically unplugged them from the old server and plugged them into the new server.\nI am in the process of uniformly reassigning owner:group and ACLs.  \nI have a few folders that seemed to be locked and do not respond to 'sudo chown newOwner:newGroup'. Cannot chmod 777 either. On the command line these appear with numbers for owner and group (probably metadata from the old server environ) and with permissions set to 755. ls -le does not show an ACL associated with the folder.  \nAny ideas of how to modify permissions? I have already tried to unlock this in the Finder with no luck.\nAlternatively, does anyone know where to find out how Yosemite (and server) handle permissions?  What is the pecking order? Do ACLs trump POSIX permissions?\nOh, one more thing. Pretty sure this folder was copied over from a PC originally.

TL;DR\nI was on ATT for years and could text iPhone and Android users with the iMessage app on my Macs and the Messages app on my iPad. I switched to T-Mobile (and ported over the same phone number) and now I can no longer use iMessage or Messages to text Android users except on my iPhone itself. How can I send and receieve text messages with Android users once again?\nDevices that I Own\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6 running iOS 8.4 on T-Mobile Pre Paid with a ported phone number from ATT\n\n*iPhone 5 running iOS 8.4, but no cell signal. Used as iPod.\n\n*iPad Air WiFi running iOS 8.4\n\n*MacBook Pro Late 2013 running Yosemite 10.10.4\n\n*MacBook Air Mid 2012 running Yosemite 10.10.4\n\n\nThe Longer Story\nI was on AT&T for years with multiple iPhones and I was able to use the iMessage app on my Mac laptops and the Messages app on my iPads to send text messages to people who used Android phones. Apple users received texts via the iMessage protocol and those messages showed up across all devices as blue. Android / non-iPhone users in general always used SMS/MMS and texts showed up as green across all devices. I could switch between devices and continue conversations with no problem. All devices were always aware of each conversation as they happened.\nI recently switched to T-Mobile and ported over my ATT number. I can no longer use the iMessage program on my Macs nor can I use the Messages app on my iPad / iPod (okay, iPhone 5 with no cell signal) to text message friends that are not themselves Apple iPhone users. I can only text message non-Apple users by directly using my iPhone 6 running iOS Also, all devices are logged in with the same Apple ID.\nI'm uncertain if the change of carriers has anything to do with it, but that's the only significnat change that's taken place that I'm aware of, and correlation always implies causation... right? Right.\nHow can I SMS/MMS non-iPhone people from my iPad / iPod / Macs?\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I changed SIM cards (though I also changed numbers). \nTo fix the problem I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Signing out of iCloud on your devices and then (starting with your phone) signing back into all of them. This seemed to update my iMessage associated number (which doesn't seem to apply to your situation since you didn't change numbers - so perhaps you can skip this)\n\n*Ensure that on all your devices iCloud accounts that your email AND (correct) phone number are listed. If your email isn't listed then add it (if your number isn't listed then repeat the above step)\n\n*On your iPhone 6 go into settings -> messages -> text message forwarding and enable it on all of your devices (that should all be connected to the internet).\n\n*Enter the relevant codes that pop up on your devices\nNote:\nI think you'd really benefit from updating your iPad Air to iOS 8.whatever instead of trying to get it to work with iOS6\nI'm also not sure if you're going to run into problems trying to get it to work on 2 phone devices. I'd try and get it working on all the other devices first and only then try and add your iPhone 5 into your ecosystem.\nHelpful sites:\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/06/text-messages-phone-calls-on-your-mac/\nHopefully you get it working! \n\nA: On your iPhone, I'd try going into Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding and then uncheck the switches by whatever is not receiving SMS messages and then check and then re-authenticate them individually, it should only take a couple of minutes.\n\nA: I had the same issues after I restored my iPhone 6. Going into Settings > Messages > Text message forwarding did the trick. \nThe only hangup was that the code took about 30 seconds to appear on my Mac's screen. And if you're impatient like I was you cancelled and tried it again some 5 times. So I'd suggest waiting at least 2 minutes before cancelling.\nIt works, afterall.\n", "Q: Can't enable Java for browser For some reason, whenever I try to enable Java in the browser by clicking on the checkbox \"Enable Java content in browser\" in the Security tab of the Java control panel, it asks for my password and then promptly unselects my selection.\nDoes anyone know what is happening?\nI have OSX 10.10.4.

I replaced the HDD with a hybrid HDD/SSD about a week ago, following iFixit's guide for doing so.

I'd like to put a larger hdd into this macbook, and then install Windows 10 onto it. Has Anybody successfully updated their Mac-based Wintel install with Windows 10, and what is involved? \nI realize this is probably a stretch, but I love making things work that should not. Half the time I boot this MacBook with my Tails Linux bootable DVD and run securely - perfect for coffeeshops, etc, as the MacBook's internal drive isn't even mounted so there's no way a dirty prankster can get their mitts on my data!\nAnyway, I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions, but please refrain from responding if all you plan to do is deride me for  wanting to do what I want to do. Constructive criticism welcome, insults are not!\nThank you!\n\nA: Please take a look at this article. It clearly describes all steps.\n\nA: It is possible to do but install at your own risk until Apple issues an update for Boot Camp.\nAssuming you have the Windows 10 ISO run the bootcamp and follow the standard procedure.\nMake sure you allocated minimum 20 GB, 30 or more is better.\nIt might take over a hour to complete.\n", "Q: How can I script the setup of preferences in Mac OS X? I have a couple of Macs and I would like to create some kind of script that I can use to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easily setup a new Mac after a reinstall\n\n*Update settings to consistent values (so if I decide to change some preferences on Mac A, I can run the script on Mac B to get it to match)\n\n\nI'd be happy if I could use this script to customize:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Finder Preferences\n\n\nI would prefer a method where I can use a script or config file to specifically set certain settings I choose to certain values.  I don't really want something that will import/export ALL settings indiscriminately.\nI also don't want some complicated IT management solution, since this is really just for me.\n\nA: I did some more digging and I managed to find a solution that isn't AppleScript-ed UI movements.\nYou can script most of the settings changes I wanted to make using the defaults command (wiki).\nAs for figuring out the actual keys/values that correspond to the UI preferences, I've found lists like this to be useful (this one too).  I've also used this little script I wrote to suss out the changes made by the UI:\n#!/bin/sh\nmv ~/new-defaults.txt ~/old-defaults.txt\ndefaults read > ~/new-defaults.txt\ndiff old-defaults.txt new-defaults.txt\n\nIt'll give you all the changes to the defaults since the last time it was ran.  There's likely going to be other changes detected (like window positions), but most of the keys seemed reasonably named.  You can then take the changed key and figure out its domain by searching the full file.\nThere appear to be other mechanisms for storing preferences in Mac OS besides this (e.g. allowing non-App Store apps does not seem to be reflected in the defaults plists), and I still haven't figured those out.  The list I liked above uses some other commands, and I'll have to look into those next.\n\nA: You should take a look at Mathias Bynens' Dotfiles. Modify it for your needs and delete the settings you don't need. Then you only need to execute the script with the terminal.app via entering sudo /path/to/the/script/./osx on each mac.\n\nA: Don't bother creating something from scratch, it has already been solved many times before as it is part of confoguration management which is a big component in IT automation. \nWhat you are looking for is the 'defaults' system as a low-level text based system Mac OS X uses to manage preferences and settings. This has been enhanced by something else from Apple called Managed Client.\nTo make it even easier, you have the option of using the Server app by Apple from the AppStore to have a nice GUI to go with that.\nYou can, however, simply use 'defaults' as-is to automate what you want. You'd still need a bit of scripting to read on one Mac and write on another (SSH is handy for that) over a network connection.\nLook them both up (defaults and Managed Client) and a whole new world will open up for you :)\n\nA: Not sure the motivation for wanting to script this “just for you.”  When I get a new system, or a clean install, the way I normally get all the settings I want is by letting Migration Assistant transfer them from my old system or it’s backup.\n", "Q: Why are the same characters displayed differently in the same sentence?

Back in June 2013 I bought an 21\" iMac with a standard 1TB HDD. By now OWC offers upgrades for these machines in the form of an SSD expansion board, which can be used to form a fusion drive with the HDD.\nHowever, they point out that some iMacs don't sport the slot for this. Is there any way I can find out if my iMac supports the SSD board, without opening it?\n\nA: From the page you linked - \n\nThe initial production of the base model for the 21.5\" iMac didn't come with a slot for the SSD. Later production models included the SSD slot, but there's no way to determine if the 2012 21.5\" iMac with a 2.7GHz processor has the SSD slot without opening it up to see if it's available. If you have already opened the iMac up and it does have an SSD slot, this SSD is compatible.\n\nThe 2.9 & 3.1 GHz machines should be compatible.\n\n", "Q: Payment from Apple for developer I'm an iOS developer and I've been selling very few apps on the App Store. I would like to ask some questions about withdrawn money from iTunes Connect.\n\nI already know\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimum payment: $150 (USD)\n\n*Apple will fund every month\n\n\n\nMy question\n\n\n*\n\n*If I earn over $150 in my account, for example: $500, how much money\nwill I receive?\n\n*I've known that Apple will fund every month, additionally, after 45\ndays of the first day of the month, is that correct? I am a little\nbit confused to calculatate this, for example, I started sale of my app at July 16, 2015, so what day does money arrived to my bank account? In addition, how do I calculate this?\n\n\nA: \nIf I earn over $150 in my account, for example: $500, how much money\n  will I receive?\n\nDepends on what you mean by \"earn\". There are two stats: \"Sales\" and \"Proceeds\". If your app receives $500 (sales), Apple will take its cut (like 33%) and you will earn like $335 (proceeds).\nYou can go to iTunes Connect, then Sales and Trends, and you will see the two stats there.\n\nI've known that Apple will fund every month, additionally, after 45 days of the first day of the month, is that correct?\n\nIf by \"fund\" you mean \"send money to my bank account\", this isn't always true. Apple will normally do it every month, but there are cases in which it will delay the payment for several months (this tends to happen if your proceeds exceed a certain threshold - I imagine its for security/verification reasons). So it is possible that Apple will retain the profit of 2 or more months and pay at another month.\nAnd yes, I believe that the very first month of sales (or 45 days) is always delayed. So your first payment will usually correspond to the first two months of sales.\n\nI started sale of my app at July 16, 2015, so what day does money\n  arrived to my bank account?\n\nWell, you will definitely not get anything on July. I suspect that you won't receive a payment in August either. You will probably receive your first payment on September (or late August), and from this point on, further payments will occur each month (normally).\n\nIn addition, how do I calculate this?\n\nGo to iTunes Connect. There is a section (I forgot how it is called, I think it is \"financial\" or \"payments\" something like that). You can observe here how much Apple owes you per month. This amount is what they are supposed to pay you. \nSince you begun sales very recently, it is likely you won't find any data here yet.\n\nApple can be late with payments. It's normal. Simply keep track of the \"amount owed\" in iTunes Connect and you're pretty much guaranteed that the payment will be performed in a future.\n\nA: Hope this helps you:\nThe amount will be deposited on same day that apple mention's as next payment date in you iTunes account one's your payable amount reaches more than 150$\nPayments and Amounts Owed: from apple Document\nThe Payments and Amounts Owed section shows your last payment, the amount we owe you for the next month, and when to expect your next payment.\n• Amounts Owed (Converted).

Yosemite is installed on my primary SSD (I have 2 additional magnetic drives). I use Boot Camp, and have Windows 8.1 installed on the same SSD alongside Yosemite.\nIf I hold down the option key on boot, I see both Mac OS and Windows as options in the boot disk selection screen, plus some recovery options. This works fine, and I can successfully boot into either from there:\n\nMy problem is that I want to make the default boot Windows (it is currently defaulting to Mac OS - so every time I restart from Windows I have to remember to hold option and select Windows), but I can't do this from Mac OS -> System Prefs -> Startup Disk, because I only see Mac OS as an option, there is no option for Windows:\n\nI'm guessing something is borked here but I have no idea why or how to solve this, any ideas? As far as I can tell my disk is partitioned fine, everything is healthy. This is the Windows partition in disk utility, I've thought about hitting 'Repair Disk' in disk utility but I have no idea what that will do and I don't want to screw up Windows:\n\nIn Windows I have the boot camp icon in my system tray with an option for Control Panel, but this only shows me keyboard options - which seems weird, are there supposed to be more options there? \n\nAlso, clicking on boot camp from Windows Control Panel does nothing:\n\nThanks\n\nA: You can set the default boot partition from the option-boot screen.

Can you boot into safe mode?\nHold the shift key while booting and release when you see the Apple logo on screen. The boot process may take longer than it usually does. Could be a LOT longer. If that works then there is something you installed that runs at startup that is causing the kernel panic.\nIf that does not work boot into Recovery Mode (Command-R at boot) and reinstall the OS right over top of what you have now. With luck that will fix it. Be careful not to reformat the drive as that will wipe out everything.

When I receive a message I don't want the sender or a preview of the content be shown on my lock screen. Some apps (like iMessage and Mail) allow you to set this in iOS' Settings -> Notifications. Other apps (like Viber) allow you to set this internally from their settings. But there are apps (like Skype), for which I don't see a way to set this.

I'm frustrated trying to solve this.\n\nA: Hi and welcome to Ask Different!\nA few things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the mute switch is off and working - on the top left side of the phone there's a switch that has a red backing if it's turned on. If it's showing red, toggle it back, and your sound will come back on. Simple :)\n\n*If that does nothing, make sure the switch works. Toggle it back and forth a few times, there should be a popup indicating that sound is now muted. If nothing appears on the screen when the switch is toggled, the switch is probably broken, and you'll need to talk to Apple or your carrier's insurance about getting it fixed.\n\n*I'm guessing you already tried this, but there are two volume settings on iOS, one for the ringer and one for apps and music. If you just use the volume rocker in most places, your ringer volume changes. If you use it while music or sound is playing, app volume changes. Make sure that your music/sound volume is up.\n\nA: Do you hear sound with EarPods in? If so, it's likely that your speaker has gone out and needs to be replaced.\n", "Q: What are alternatives for Menumeters on El Capitan?

I also have 5 Finder windows under this Chrome window. So I can't see any Finder windows. Now I need a Finder window, so  I use Mission Control. Everything works well, but when I close this Finder window, other all Finder windows show up on top of the screen, I don't need them, I only need one window.\nHow can I prevent this? \nThis is happening all apps. Not just in Finder and I am using Yosemite 10.10.\n\nA: This is the Apple paradigm - all windows belonging to one app are part of a single process, unlike Windows, which is, as the name suggests, windows-based. Apple is App-based. What you are seeing is intended behaviour.\nThe simplest 'workaround' - though to me an indispensable way to use the machine - is to enable Spaces & the associated hot-keys, then put 'important' apps on a Space of their own & switch using the hot-keys. \n[I'm in the middle of teaching someone how to use that method right now in meatworld - a Windows migrant learning the new paradigm - so if you're interested, I'll try to flesh out exactly how to go about it.]\n\nA: You're clicking the Finder icon in Mission Control, click ONLY the window you want to display.\n", "Q: How do I change the generic folder icon in Yosemite 10.10.4?

I had to have my 2011 MacBook Pro wiped out and re-installed because of malware. I noticed that my previous package--iMovie, GarageBand, and iPhoto--is not longer installed. I checked online forums and Q&A, and I was able to find iMovie under my purchases in the Apple account. However, GarageBand and iPhoto are not there/ available. I don't understand why one would be associated with my account, and the rest would not. That's odd. I'd like to see what possibility is there to have GarageBand, and iPhoto reinstalled. \n\nA: Once you do a reinstallation wipe of a Mac all data, including apps (even Apple ones) are deleted. So, unfortunately it seems like you'll have to buy GarageBand (it came with your Mac the first time, right? You didn't buy it separately, did you?). It sounds like you can redownload iMovie, and iPhoto was replaced by Photos (free from Mac App Store).\n", "Q: What can I do when my Time Machine password is not accepted, although it's correct? Having troubles with a botched system upgrade on OS X 10.10.3, I tried to restore my MacBook Pro, 15\" Early 2011 version, using an encrypted Time Machine backup made on an external USB drive.\nThe backup is in working order; I can boot from it just fine. However, when I try to restore from a previous backup version through the system restore feature, I am asked for my Time Machine backup volume, and when I click the external drive, and enter the password, there's a dialog saying the password is wrong.\nBut it isn't.\nI am a hundred percent certain it's the correct password. It can't be copy-pasted, unfortunately, but I've typed it often enough to know it's correct. And when I finally got to boot the Mac after the – what I thought was – a botched update, I checked my Keychain to verify that the Time Machine password was actually the one I had used previously.\nHas this ever happened to anyone, and is there any solution to this, apart from maybe creating an entirely new Time Machine volume and, gasp, not encrypting it?\n\nA: I had the same issue happen to me, and in my case, this turned out to be the cause:\nI had stored the password in a password manager, and for some reason, a special character had slipped into it. However, this character was not visible in the password manager, neither was it in the keychain! I have no idea when and how that character had slipped into the password.\nAs a consequence, when copying and pasting it from there, it worked, but when entering it manually, it did not work, because this special character was missing.\nI teared my hair until I finally found that out which was only after I had copied and pasted the password into a text editor out of sheer desperation. In this text editor, a symbol was displayed for the non-printable character.\nHow to fix\nI fixed the problem by changing the password of the sparsebundle. To do so\n\n*\n\n*locate the Time Machine sparsebundle (if on a network drive, connect to it first)\n\n*open Terminal and enter\n\nhdiutil chpass \n\n\n\n*add a space after above command\n\n*from Finder, draw the sparsebundle to the Terminal window\n\n*hit enter\n\nThis allows you to set a new password for the sparsebundle, so you won't have the same problem again in the future. You shouldn't have to enter the current password because it will be taken from your keychain.\nI changed the password of all my Time Machine backups.\n\nA: The same thing just happened to me again after a logic board swap. The backup could not be restored in recovery mode with a message saying that the password was wrong.\nHowever, booting into the regular installation wizard, macOS asks you whether you want to migrate existing data. Choose this option; here you'll find your backup disk. When selecting it, you will be asked for the same password. In the migration wizard, the password works.\nThis is a serious flaw with the recovery procedure, but Apple Support does not seem to be aware of it.\n\nA: I would delete the existing keychain entry for your backup and re-enter.  It is very possible that you have saved an incorrect value to your keychain.\n", "Q: Restarting or resetting diplay and/or GPU without logging out or rebooting?

I suspect the rest of the computer is still operational (although I'm not certain of this), and I'd like to restart only the display.\n\nA: Changing the resolution will reset the GPU.\nI recommend the QuickRes app, since you can also set keyboard shortcuts.\nRead more here http://www.macworld.com/article/2012693/mac-gems-quickres-helps-you-get-the-most-out-of-retina-displays.html\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Yosemite hangs during boot My MacBook Pro froze earlier whilst using it, so I did a hard reboot.

I also tried resetting the NVRAM and SMC but nothing has made any difference.\nI don't know what else to try, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: Safe Mode working means that it is likely that something you installed is preventing the OS from booting. Specifically programs you have added to start at login in your user account or other things you may have installed that adds kexts to the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Look in System Preferences > Users &Groups > Login Items\n\n\nRemove them all and reboot. If it boots one of them is the problem, add them back till you find which one it was.\n\n\n*Look in /Library/StartupItems\n\n\nDrag everything out of there (desktop or a folder somewhere) and reboot. As above if it boots fine one of those was the problem.\nIt is also possible that something went wrong with the OS and something OS related was damaged. you could try applying the latest combo updater for your current OS to see if that helps.\nIf nothing there helps, either I missed a location for startup items or you may need to reinstall the base OS. But before you do that, boot in safe mode and backup your drive.\n", "Q: MacBook Mail Issue I added an new Gmail account to my Mac OS X Mail app in the Dock and it says it's there except I don't get email from that particular account.

A member of the Apple Developer Program for your organization doesn’t automatically have access to iTunes Connect.

Is it possible to buy them at Apple authorized repair sites?\n\nA: Philips power plug\nI use this for traveling as they are often cheaper than the original. You can plug any philips power plug in the adapter.\n\ncorrect me if I am wrong, but I thought these were called philips power plugs\n\nA: It is possible that some Apple Authorized repair sites have them, but I would say it would be a long shot as most of those stores just sell 30-pin cables, lightning cables, and power bricks; nothing else. Your best bet is to go to your local apple store (if you have one nearby) or just order it from apples website or a more reputable place like Amazon. It is possible that the non genuine could work just fine but it could also break after a day or damage the power port.\n\nA: Most Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP) will likely have some that they could sell.  Probably not new ones, but used ones or spares.\n\nA: The folks at Twelve South make the Plug Bug adapter that would fit the bill. It costs a bit more than an exact replacement would probably be. I borrowed one for a month and used it every day. No worries about how safe it is to use it and it fast charges my iPad mini.

I have an external hard-disk with a single Mac OS Extended partition. This disk stopped working a couple of days ago. I tried to repair the external hard drive with disk utility but no luck. The error message is the following:\nError: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as\npossible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nThe hard drive doesn't appear on the side bar of Finder or on the desktop.\nOn disk utility the hard drive name appears to be on \"gray\" text than \"black\" text.\nHow do I repair it on the terminal?\nOr how can I back up the external hard drive if I can't even access it normally?\ndiskutil list: 0: FDisk_partition_scheme *500.1 GB disk2 1: DOS_FAT_32 500.1 GB disk2s1 (That's one disk btw, and I don't know why it's on fat32, I last formatted it on MAC OS Extended Journaled)\nThank you\n\nA: You could try to \"mount\" it via Terminal.\nFirst, make a mount point:\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/EXT_HD\n\nNow mount (your device numbers may be different, e.g. /dev/disk2s1 — you can determine what it is as it will the the highest number when you issue the command ‘ls /dev/disk*’):\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk3s1 /Volumes/EXT_HD/\n\nIt might eventually show up in Devices in Finder.\n\nA: I ran into a similar situation once before; Yosemite wouldn't read my USB drive formatted FAT32.  There is also this posting from Stackexchange: Yosemite cannot mount 64GB FAT32 SD Card  and this one from Apple Support.  I also found this thread regarding the WD Drives and Fat32 FAT32 Size Limitations?\nI decided that the safest thing to do was to back it up under Windows, reformat the drive NTFS and copy everything back over.  FAT32 is an old MS-DOS format and what better to read MS-DOS than a Windows machine, right?\nNow, as for how it got that way, well, drives can't \"change\" its format on you.  If you remember formatting the drive as something else, then I have to ask \"Are you sure that is the same drive?\"\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to enroll in Apple Developer Program now?

But I noticed that once the phone was turned on it wasn't charging. I tried a new charger, but all the chargers I have create the same outcome. I think this may be due to my phone and not the charger, does anyone know why it doesn't want to charge while on?\n\nA: Sounds like a bad battery to me. You can get a new battery and everything you need to change it at a website called iFixit for like $30 shipped, (don't worry, for a 4S, a battery replacement is super easy, it's just 4 screws and pulling the battery connector off of the logic board).\n", "Q: Time Machine backup from external hard drive stuck in trash I got a new iMac after my old one died. As my old one was dying I made several Time Machine backups to a 1T G-Drive external. Unfortunately, I must have done it incorrectly because the backups have used up so much of the space on the external that there's not enough room to back up my new iMac to the external. The Time Machine backup for the old iMac could not have been more than 350 GB, so, I am a bit perplexed. Last night I attempted to remove some of the older multiple backups of the same files from the old machine by dragging them to the trash. It seemed to work until I got to the next most recent backup and when the files finally copied over to the trash the window said there were more than 1,500,000 files! After waiting for hours for the trash to empty, I finally gave up when their were something like 1,200,000 files remaining. Am I going to be able to delete these files from this backup and free up space on my external drive so I can backup my new computer, or do I just need to give up and buy a new external?\n\nA: Time Machine performs versioning backups at specific time intervals and keeps making backups until it runs out of space on the drive, then it starts to prune away older backups to make room for the new ones.\n\nThe only way that I know of to control the amount of space that any one Time Machine Backup uses is to set up a partition on the drive in Disk Utility and then have Time Machine back up to that partition.\nYou will not be able to delete some of the time machine backup as it is stored like a database, and it is an all or nothing delete.\n\n\nResponse to Trash Question\n\nIf you have 1.2MM files, Secure delete will take a very long time to do this.\nIf you do not mind that the data will not be overwritten and only the file associations will be removed you can do this to clear out the Trash.\nFirst of all BE INCREDIBLY CAREFUL WHEN USING RECURSIVE DELETE FROM TERMINAL\nWith that warning out of the way, here is how you can do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*First open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities).\n\n\nEDIT step two is for the trash bin in your user directory. Yours is likely on the root of the drive itself. As I don't know what that path will be I can't give you that step. Just replace that path for the one after cd. The file is likely hidden, so if you do not know how to show hidden files I will add the Terminal commands at the bottom of the post.\nFROM user3439894  use sudo rm -fR /Volumes/<volume_name>/.Trashes/$UID/*\nThis will be what the path to your external drive's trash looks like. You will have to figure out the exact path on your drive. You can also skip the drag and drop steps doing it the way user3439894 suggests.\n\n\n*Type cd ~/.Trash and press Return.\n\n*Then type sudo rm -Rf followed by a Space (don’t leave out the space). You will need the recursive for to handle subdirectories, etc.\n\n*Don’t press Return yet.\n\n*Next, click the Trash icon in your Dock to open a window displaying the contents of the Trash.\n\n*Select everything in that window and drag it into the Terminal window; this action adds the paths of all those files and folders to the rm(remove) command.\n\n*Now, press Return \n\n*Enter your administrator password when prompted\n\n\nIn a moment or two (depending on how much was in your Trash), the Trash icon should return to its empty state.\n-- The answer I provided is based on the technique that I obtained from Joe Kissell's article on MacWorld and have used during the times I have not been able to empty my trash bin.\n\nHow To Display Hidden Files In Mac OSX\nterminal\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true return\nkillall Finder return\nHow To Hide Hidden Files in Mac OSX\nterminal\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles false return\nkillall Finder return\n\nA: I have a utility called Techtool Pro 5.

When I attempt to update them, an email address that I do not recognize comes up as linked to those particular Apps and asks for a password.  All of my other \nApps are linked to my correct email/ iTunes account email.  How did this happen & how can I rectify it?  Also, does this mean someone else has access to what I'm posting on these 3 Apps?\nThanks, \n\nA: Did someone help you set up your phone?   \nOne way this could happen is that someone used their Apple ID to download apps on your phone. \nIt could also happen if you restored, updated or migrated your phone on someone else's computer.\nThe easiest way to solve it is by deleting and downloading them again with your Apple ID.  \nThe problem is, at least with WhatsApp, that you will lose the data stored in it. You can export conversations by email but that is a very rough way of backing up and it usually leaves out media.\nInstagram will ask for your credentials and you'll be ok; Skype will be somewhere around those lines too, but check their support site for specifics —I'm thinking chat history.\nAs for your data being compromised, it is probably not the case. The person who used this email you don't recognize to download apps on your phone (which is their Apple ID) only has access to a copy of the app on his purchase history —the same copy everybody has access too by the way— not the data inside of it. I would check if this Apple ID was used for some other service on your phone, which could have privacy implications, but that should be asked separately.\n", "Q: How to create a 'Sharing Only' account via terminal in OS X? I'm attempting to create a 'Sharing Only' account in an OS X app. \nI've tried code based on examples like these:\nCan user accounts be managed via the command line?\nWhat steps are needed to create a new user from the command line on mountain lion?\nwithout success.\nFrom System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> Advanced Options for 'Sharing Only' account:\nHome directory: /dev/null\nSince /dev/null discards streams directed to it, substitution in place of '/Users/NewUser' into above code doesn't work.\n\nA: Based on bispymusic's answer to a previous question:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser    # use whatever account name you want\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser RealName \"Sharing-only Account\"\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser hint \"Password Hint\"\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser picture \"/Path/To/Picture.png\"\ndscl . passwd /Users/sharinguser thisistheaccountpassword\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser UniqueID 550    # Pick something unique\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser PrimaryGroupID 20    # Staff group\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser UserShell /usr/bin/false    # No shell access allowed!\ndscl . create /Users/sharinguser NFSHomeDirectory /dev/null    # No home directory!\n\nAs with the script it's based on, you'll either need to run it with sudo, or prefix each dscl command with sudo. Be sure to adjust the account name, RealName, password, and UniqueID (and probably the hint and picture). Note that the critical attributes to make this a sharing-only account are the UserShell and NFSHomeDirectory attributes -- leave these as I have them.\nIt's a bit confusing that all of the lines refer to /Users/sharinguser (or whatever account name you choose) despite this not existing in the filesystem -- this is because it doesn't refer to a file path, but to the path to a record in OS X's directory service. The filesystem and OS X directory services both use the same path notation, but actually have very little to do with each other. Thus, the home directory path can be set to /dev/null while the account's path directory service stays normal.\n", "Q: iBooks Author imports ePub text very large I have an inDesign file that I'm exporting as a fixed ePub. When I import it into iBooks Author using the blank template, the text is gigantic. For instance one text box is set to 389 pt. The text is so large it exceeds the mask around it. The font selection doesn't seem to matter.\nCreating outlines solves the issue but I would like to keep it as text. Is there a way to control the size of the text better?\n\nA: The best way to control text size would be to convert the file to text/markdown. That way you would have total control over the sizing.\nIt really depends on how proficient you are in editing inDesign or simplifying the formatting there to see if you can tweak things there to isolate the part of the native -> ePub conversion that's running amok.\nIf you're good there, take a simpler approach to fix things. If you have no aptitude or time to learn inDesign or clean up the document's formatting (I've seen some PageMaker files that got moved to inDesign that are incredibly convoluted and needed to be thrown out and started over from text).\nSorry I can't be more specific. If you want to ask a follow on question with specific details on what item is being converted or can upload a minimal test case, someone might have a better idea on preventing the poor conversion from one format to another.\n", "Q: How does Xcode communicate with an iOS device? I can plug in an iOS device and tell Xcode to run my app on that device or stop it. I can have the app paused at any time and use the debugger to debug the running app. How is this all possible? There must be some kind of a background process on iOS that acts as a liaison between Xcode and the debugger and iOS.\n\nA: When you connect iPhone to Xcode and you click 'Use for Development', Xcode will download and mount DDI(Developer Disk Image). This image has DebugServer.app along other utilities that permit Xcode to perform development actions.\n\nA: There are a number of diagnostic services that run in background on iOS devices.\nI don't think Apple have completely documented the way that Xcode communicates and controls processes on iOS devices, but after a 2014 presentation at a hacker conference by security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski, Apple documented a few of the background processes that allow access to data on iOS devices.\nFor example...\n\ncom.apple.mobile.house_arrest\nhouse_arrest is used by iTunes to\ntransfer documents to and from an iOS device for apps that support\nthis functionality.

Or is there any folder in my computer or online which saved iCloud files before syncing?\n\nA: \nThe iCloud Drive directory is located within Mobile Documents. You can access iCloud Drive via Terminal with:\ncd Library/Mobile\\ Documents/\ncredit\n\nNote that the Mobile Documents directory could not be found in Finder. You can get a list of sub-directories in Mobile Documents by typing\nls in Terminal. For example, the iCloud Drive directory for Pages.app is\ncd Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~pages\nTry to find your documents in these directories. You may better keep offline to avoid iCloud syncing errors, if any, continue deleting your local files. If files are there, copy them out using cp.\nIf not, please try to log out your iCloud account in System Preference.app and re-log in. This enables OS X to re-fetch the iCloud files index and sync them again. However the chance it works is small, because your files are already missing on iCloud.com.\nMy guess is that some wrong operations delete all local iCloud Drive documents, and this change is synced to iCloud.com so all your online files are also deleted. The last solution would be to recover your files in iCloud Drive from a Time Machine backup.\nHope things go well!\n", "Q: Notes Application terminating on every startup I have been a heavy-user of the build in Notes Application on OS X for a couple of months now.

Much of the diagnostic information in console.app requires one of two things to be useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access to Apple's source code and internal support documents\n\n*Access to a large volume of logs from dozens (or ideally hundreds or more) of Macs to use a tool like splunk to collect and analyze various logs to identify patterns of error messages to trace back issues like this to root causes.\n\n\nIn the mean time, use old-fashioned pen and paper to make a note of the wall clock time when the Mac is slow and look at Activity Monitor / top and perhaps collect one sysdiagnose each time you notice the Mac being slow. Once you have 10 incidents, you might have enough data to know what processes are making your experience poor and determine if your slowness is related to:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU constraints or overcommitment\n\n*Memory pressure\n\n*Storage issues\n\n*Network dependancies\n\n\nA good place to start on that monitoring is using top or vm_stat to run when before you notice the slowness and then review for data once you notice that the Mac has actually slowed down.\nOS X: Memory usage freaking me out\nI would also write down what you wanted to do and what other apps were running when you notice slow downs.

All our phones are using data during the night when we are asleep.  I thought that apps were only supposed to update on WIFI.  But my phone is always on airplane mode at night unless I forget, so last night I put in on airplane mode, took a screenshot as evidence, and sure enough, a tiny bit of data was used at 6:00am this morning before I got up.  How is that possible?\n\nA: @Tyson's comment provides some insight based on your checking the data usage with your carrier, AT&T.\nThe time that is posted by AT&T is the time that they added the usage to your account, not necessarily the time that the usage was done.\nAs an experiment, if you can spare one of your iPhones that long, is to set it in Airplane mode for a day or two and see what AT&T reports.  This thread on the AT&T forum explains some of the fine print.\n\n\nA: I have 2 iPhones on my desk and I often switch both of phone into flight mode with wifi off after 9:00 pm and turn off the router's wifi at the same time, and there is a radio electromagnetic field meter on the same desk. And some days ago, the meter detected some electromagnetic field, as strong as wifi on the phone is on and near to the meter. SO I started to be curious since then.  The sign last for around 10 seconds. I think even when iPhone is flight mode with wifi off, there maybe be some system mechanism inside iPhone to detect wifi around or the iPhone itself was trying to send some data out. And maybe my iPhone was hacked.:)\n", "Q: Immobilise Desktops I want to make my Desktops stay in an order that I want. I want to have my first 3 Desktops locked and others dynamic in example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm working on Desktop1. When an app is full screen the app is between Desktop1 and Desktop2 but I want it to open after Desktop4 since the others mounted. \n\n*I'm working on Desktop3. When I open an app from Dock(or cmd+tab) which is currently opened in Desktop1, Desktop1 and Desktop2 changes positions. I don't want this to happen I want to go to Desktop1 without changing the order.\n\n\nHope I explained clearly. Is there a way I can immobilise some Desktops.\n\nA: You can have them all static or dynamic but not a mix of both.  To make them static (so they stay as you put them) do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Click on Mission Control\n\n*Uncheck Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\nThis will keep them as they are arranged by you.  To arrange them, drag them to the desired position after launching Mission Control.\n\n", "Q: How do I pass a password to hdiutil attach?

Next I'd boot the Mac with the Yosemite USB Installer and install Yosemite to an External USB Drive, preferably a USB 3.0 HDD/SSD or even a large Thumb Drive.  Once the install to the External USB Drive is complete I'd boot the Mac from it and then download and install Ontrack EasyRecovery (on the external disk) then shutdown and move the External USB Drive to your MacBook Pro and boot from it. Then run Ontrack EasyRecovery and see what can be recovered.  If the trial shows promising results then purchase the product and recover as much of your User Data that you can.\n", "Q: Phone calls from sons phone showing up on my phone How do I stop my sons phone calls from showing up on my phone?\n\nA: You may create a different Apple ID for your son (or for you), or disable iPhone Cellular Calls. Go to Settings > FaceTime and turn them off.\nYou can use Family Sharing –as suggested– to share purchased apps and media, among other things.\n\nA: You should look into Settings-Phone-and disable Calls on Other Devices.\nThat may work for you.\n", "Q: No Shuffle in iTunes 12.2? Is there any shuffle option in iTunes 12.2 for Mac?\n(I haven't found one) and why Apple has deliberately removed the main feature of any music player?\nI mean no one listens to music in playlist/A-Z order. \nPS: Why downvote. They did remove the shuffle button from most of the interface and made it a bit harder to access.\nIt used to be here:\n\nThere is doesn't seem to be an option to shuffle all.\nI selected all songs and there is no option on right click:\n\nThe option in the panel menu seems to be there, but it doesn't affect the order in which iTunes plays my queue.\n\nYeah they did leave Shuffle on playlists, but who uses playlists in iTunes anyways, right? I mean I usually just shuffle over all my library and my guess is majority does the same. Now I need to create a playlist only to shuffle over all the trucks and update it on every update of the library?\n\nA: A note after the question update…\nShuffle isn't as random as you think. It's a one-off process that is only re-computed every time you switch shuffle off & on again. Until you do that, the previously generated shuffle can be stepped back & forth in exactly the same pseudo-random order.\nAlso - if you have manually enqueued songs, it will only shuffle songs after the manually added tracks…\n\nShuffle & Repeat are always available in the Controls menu… & always searchable...\n\nIf iTunes is actually playing [or has been playing & now paused], it's in the top centre panel, as always…\nThe only time it doesn't appear here is before you start to play the first song since launch, or after a manual Clear of the Up Next list.\n\nIn all views except My Music > Song & Album, it's in the top of the main window…\n\nAnywhere else it's usually on the right-click menu…\n", "Q: I get a bash syntax error message every time I open Terminal I've been getting this error for the past couple of months and I wonder if it's a major issue, and how do I fix it?\nWhen I open terminal on my Mac I get this bash error:\n~bash: /Users/admin/.bash_profile: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 'fi'\n~bash: /Users/admin/.bash_profile:line 1: 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; than eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"; fi'\n\nAnybody know what's going on?\n\nA: Open the Terminal.app and type the following line at your prompt\nsed -i '' 's/than/then/' .bash_profile\n\nYou do have a .bash_profile in your home directory.\n\nA: To add a little information to fd0's terse answer.\nFirst, you do indeed have a file .bash_profile in admin's home folder - you just can't see it as all files with a name that starts . are invisible. In the Terminal type ls -A and you will see them all.\nSecond, your problem is that something or someone has added a line to the file containing a syntax error. The than should be then as it is part of an if-then statement. Open the file in your favourite text editor (if you don't have one then newcomers seem to find nano usable so nano .bash_profile in Terminal should do it) and change the line.\n", "Q: What is the default function for a play/pause media key? I have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.  It has a button labelled play/pause.  When I have no keyboard drivers installed, the way the button behaves is by toggling playing and pausing in whatever most recent application that supports the behaviour.  For example, if my browser is the currently focussed app, but the previously focussed app is iTunes, then the button will play and pause the sound in iTunes.  If the previous app was Spotify, the button will trigger in Spotify.  The same goes for VLC.\nThis behaviour of remembering which app to toggle is great and I want to continue using it.  I'm now using USB Overdrive to remap the rest of the Microsoft media keys.  I am purposely not using the Microsoft keyboard driver because it conflicts with Karabiner which I also use and is compatible with USB Overdrive.\nThe problem is that in USB Overdrive the default is to set the play/pause button to call iTunes' play command.  This breaks the behaviour I described above.\nWhat is the name of the default Mac play function that remembers which app to toggle?  Is there a way to run this function from Applescript or Bash?  USB Overdrive allows programming a key to launch an application.  I believe that the best solution would be to call this function from a script wrapped in a Mac application and link that to USB Overdrive.\n\nA: It appears that there is a Gist on GitHub using USB Overdrive and a Windows Keyboard that addresses how to map the media keys the way you want to. Configure media keys on a non-Apple keyboard to control Spotify via AppleScript and USB Overdrive on OSX.\nIf you scroll down to ludalex addition to the Gist, they have added an Applescript that can identify either iTunes or Spotify and assign the Play/Pause key press to the correct app.\n\nA: I actually found a really simple solution to this problem: delete the play button entry from USB Overdrive and then it won't overwrite the behaviour and everything is as it was for that one button.\nInterestingly, this the play key is referred to by Karabiner as ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY.  See https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en.\n", "Q: OSX color picker history - save file data I'm not exactly sure if I am using the right terminology, but when using the OSX color picker, you have the ability to store colors in your own personal archive.

Does anyone know where this data is stored? \nThanks! \n\nA: In my investigation it seems the preferences are saved here:\n~/Library/Colors/NSColorPanelSwatches.plist\n\nIt is my guess that this file would be overwritten on a clean install.  However, if you want keep it, from here on out you may be able to copy it to a safe location.

A lot hotter than it turned when I was using the iMac as my primary machine.\nThe iMac is running a fresh install of OS X Mavericks so there shouldn't be an issue with a lot of background apps running.\nAny ideas on why this could be?\n\nA: I'm experiencing the same problem.  I have a current generation 5K iMac which I use as my main computer, and a 2009 iMac which I use as a second monitor using TDM.  In TDM mode, the older iMac runs painfully hot.  Switch back to regular mode, and that same iMac runs cool.\nTypically, I don't even bother to login to the older iMac - I just turn it on and off with the power switch when I want to use it in TDM.

I guess this one (Crucial BX100 500GB) is compatible but I need features of it to search for the proper one. Could you guys help me?\n\nA: All SATA SSDs will work with your MacBook. There is actually no such thing as an SSD only suitable for Mac however a few companies do advertise like this.\nSo basically any SATA SSD from any brand and with any capacity will work with your MacBook, just make sure that it is a 2.5\" internal SSD :)\nBefore you do actually change to a SSD I recommend you creating either a bootable USB with OS X on it or make sure you've backed up your system via Time Machine on an external hard drive so you can actually install Mac OS on the SSD.\n\nA: My 2 cents:  Before replacing your HDD with an SSD (which I've done a couple of times with laptops I've owned), you should upgrade your white Macbook with the latest firmware from Apple for that white 2010 Macbook.\nAnd with the latest firmware installed in your white 2010 Macbook, you can upgrade your RAM to 16GBs and upgrade your HDD/SSD to 2TBs, plus Sierra will run smoother & quicker, too.\n", "Q: Where is You Tube application My youtube app has disappeared from the screen but is still giving me update notifications and shows up in my list of apps to turn on data and such.

What is the current best practice for setting up a development environment on OS X?\nI recently got a new Mac with OS X 10.10, Yosemite. \nI'm familiar with homebrew, and from my Linux experience, also with VirtualBox and using (headless) VMs. However, I know virtually (pun intended) nothing about Docker.\nI'm a developer and have recently begun learning Node.js and Meteor. I have worked in the past mostly with Python on Linux machines. However, since 2013 I've had a self-imposed break from daily development while I've returned to school to earn a new degree.\nA lot has changed since I left full-time development work in 2013 (I should have done a better job of staying on top of things). Now there's Docker, I'm hearing about Ansible for the first time, Homebrew is still around, no one seems to be using MacPorts anymore, and I feel completely lost with regard to figuring out the optimal way to setup my new machine for Node, Python, and C/C++ development.\nMy primary concern, aside from being free to play with and develop apps in Node, Python, and C/C++, is that my development environment must not interfere with my OS and daily computing life at all. For instance, when I got my first Mac back in 2009, I used homebrew to install Python and several packages, and at some point my system got somewhat screwed up with all the cruft I put on it.\nI definitely want to avoid that. If that means using a VM or container (I'm not sure what the difference is, btw) to do all my development in, so be it, no matter how inconvenient it is. I'd rather keep my OS X system clean.\nOn the other hand, if there is a way to develop directly on my OS X machine, while keeping it clean and without allowing any software I install to interfere with my \"normal\" day-to-day apps and usage, that would be nice.\nCan anyone offer any suggestions/advice? I have googled several variations of the query \"os x development environment [language]\" and have used search tools to filter out all but recent entries, but I haven't found an article on the subject yet that I am confident in.\n\nA: There will be no correct answer to your question. Much relies on your preferences and development needs.\nDevelopers working on Mac or iOS software are expected, by Apple, to do so without using a virtual machine.\nIf you are deploying to Linux or a non-Mac platform, a virtual machine is probably recommended.\nTo test your software on other versions of OS X, a virtual machine can be helpful.\nCompiled Languages\nTo develop with C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift use Xcode. Xcode is Apple's own development tool and it will not harm your installation of OS X.\nScripts and Dynamic Languages\nTo develop with python or another scripting language, consider using a tool that allows installation of multiple versions of your language.\n\n\n*\n\n*For python investigate virtualenv; see Multiple Python Versions on OSX with Virtualenv and Homebrew;\n\n*For perl this would be perlbrew. \n\n\nThe aim is to install and use a version of your language that is isolated from the OS X provided binaries. Updates may change the OS X provided edition, but your environment will remain unchanged.\nHomebrew and MacPorts\nYou should be able to use both homebrew and MacPorts without risk to your installation of OS X. Both package managers try to isolate their installations and both simplify removal of unwanted or troublesome software.\nIf you encounter problems, please log bugs with the developers.\nAs of 2015, both package managers are being actively developed:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can follow homebrew's development on Github;\n\n*You can see recent changes to MacPorts in their timeline.\n\n\nA: Another option which is now available on the App store is Veertu. I am using it and it works perfect. The free version enables me to run multiple isolated linux and windows Vms and also docker.\n\nA: Use VirtualBox and Vagrant with a spot of post installation and you have a great isolated development environment.\nI usually use the Red Hat family of Linux but for Concourse CI to work, I need to use Ubuntu. \nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Oracle VirtualBox\n\n*Vagrant installed\n\n\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*open up a terminal shell on MAC\n\n*create a directory called 2019_ubuntu/ and cd into it \n\n*use this vagrant box https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-17.10\n\n*$ vagrant init bento/ubuntu-17.10\n\n*$ vagrant up\n\n*$ vagrant ssh\n\n*create a new user\n\n*install docker-ce  \n\n*install docker-compose\n\n*add docker group and add your user to that group\n\n*additionally, add docker service to startup automatically on restart\n\n*additionally, create a PS1 prompt for your shell ( if you created\n\n*your user correctly then this may be omitted)\n\n*check that docker is running OK with hello-world\n\n", "Q: What does \"Lost Mode Pending\" mean? In Find My iPhone, once setting the parameters to enable Lost Mode, the screen displays the status as Lost Mode Pending. \nPending? Why is it pending?\nOutside of the Lost Mode feature, I don't otherwise have a lock on my phone. \nHow long will it be pending? Will the person with my phone be able to read my incoming texts while it continues to pend? \n\nA: It will remain pending until it connects to the Internet. \nIt is recommended to change your Apple ID and other affected passwords, although if connected to Internet, the device should enforce the Lost Mode and protect your content.\nIf the person who has your phone has prevented it to connect prior to you having set up the Lost Mode information present on your iPhone is visible to them until it connects.\nIt will be forever pending if it is put on recovery mode before being connected to Internet, but it won't be usable because of Activation Lock. In this case your data will be erased.\n\nA: Lost mode will enable as soon as someone turns on the phone. \nFrom Apple support:\n\nWhat if your iOS device is off or offline?\n  If your missing device is off or offline, you can still put it in Lost Mode, lock it, or remotely erase it. The next time your device is online, these actions will take effect. If you remove the device from your account while it's offline, any pending actions for the device will be cancelled.\n\n", "Q: Can the Apple Watch gracefully support this timesystem? At The Natural Cycle Clock, I try to implement an ancient timekeeping system, in which the day from sunrise to sunset is divided into twelve hours which are equal in length to other hours of that specific day, and the night from sunset to sunrise is divided into twelve hours, equal in length to other hours of that specific day, with the consequence that unless it's at an equinox or you're at the equator, hours of the day are not equal in length to hours of the night, and the length of an hour of one day is usually slightly different from the day before. (Note to visitors: The Natural Cycle Clock as a webpage is practically stone age, and no attempt has been made to polish it up.)\nCan the Apple Watch gracefully display a clock for this time system without getting an app into the store? Does it work, gracefully, to implement a nice clock for said system as a carefully tailored microsite and use it, or would such a microsite be relegated to second-class status because it's not one of the bundled options for timekeeping?\n\nA: It would be great if the Apple Watch could. As of the current version, it cannot. However, future versions may allow this. The current developer terms do not allow for timekeeping apps. From the iPhone in Canada website:\n\nUnder chapter 10, “User Interface,” developers will find a new entry,\n  10.7, which says “Watch apps whose primary function is telling time will be rejected.” This rule corroborates Gruber’s forecast: Apple\n  doesn’t want to give up the watch face to developers. Considering the\n  effort, the countless hours put into the 10 watch faces currently\n  available for the Apple Watch, and the new rule, you can forget about\n  custom watch faces anytime soon\n\n.\n\nA: There is no way to display content on the watch without an app. The Apple Watch does not have a web browser.\n", "Q: Specify genre for iTunes Radio On older versions of iTunes Radio, I could type in free-form text for a genre for iTunes Radio (eg \"Mongol\").\nNow, clicking on \"Radio\" just gives me a list of genres that Apple has chosen (\"Alternative\", \"Classical Alternative\", etc.). How can I search for a Radio Station of a genre I specify?\n\nA: The top-right corner of iTunes has a search box. Typing in \"mongol\" gives \"Search for \"mongol\" in Apple Music\". That gives \"Showing Results for \"mongol\" in Apple Music\".\nListed amongst that is \"Top Results\", \"Albums\", \"Songs\", \"Artists\" and \"Stations\". Stations lists radios such as \"Mongol Radio\".\nSeems a rather roundabout approach, but at least it works.\n", "Q: iOS's Spelling Predictive Analysis - for bilingual writers? I love my iPhone 6 :) But I'm fully bilingual in Spanish and in English, and about 50% of my emails are in each language. Here's the problem. While my iPhone is in English, every time I write an email in Spanish, every single word it automatically changes to the closest English word! Argh! And as if this wasn't bad enough, unless I click on the \"quoted\" option, it just keeps doing it grrrr. This makes writing in the other language very, very tedious - to the point where I can't.\nI'm wondering if there's a way to configure iOS or the dictionary or an app or something so that the spelling suggestions can use the dictionaries from both languages together, or something else that achieves that effect?\n\nA: You have to activate the corresponding keyboards on Settings > General > Keyboards > Keyboards. Then when writing on each language, tap the world icon to the left of the space bar to switch between languages. The spelling check, prediction and dictionaries will be independent. The voice recognition also switches with it.\n\nIf you keep the globe pressed, a list will pop up, and you can chose the language directly.\n\nEsto me da una buena excusa para escribir en español (mientras no exista un \"Pregunta Diferente\").\n\nAs you see from the screen-grab, no spelling suggestions are made to my Spanish phrase because I had the Spanish keyboard activated while writing it. However, if I go back and tap on it with the English keyboard activated, it will get red all over.\n\n\nA: Check out Swift Key, its an alternative keyboard app for iphone and it allows you to have two dictionaries active at te same time. I write words in English and in Spanish in the same text all the time without the need of changing dictionary over and over.\nThis is a review that I found.\nOne of the biggest third party keyboards on Android, SwiftKey was quick to announce its support for iOS 8 following WWDC back in June.\nThe main thing to say about SwiftKey is that it's clever. Yes, it has a nicely executed swipe-to-type system, but it's the way it learns that's really impressive.\nSwiftKey observes how you type and adjusts its word predicting suggestion system accordingly. It'll even tap into your Google and Facebook accounts (with your permission) and see how you type there too, and if you've used SwiftKey before on Android you can tap into that existing data.\nIt's also BILINGUAL, so you can type in two languages without having to switch between character sets.\nRead more at http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/best-ios-8-keyboards-swype-swiftkey-minuum-and-more#MM7Bwdzqkm0GjGke.99\nhow-do-i-type-in-two-languages-on-iphone-ipad\nhttps://blog.swiftkey.com/how-do-i-type-in-two-languages-on-iphone-ipad/\n\nA: iOS 10 includes a “multilingual typing” feature.

There have been internet connection issues (among other problems) and I'm trying to back up my photos to the cloud before I restore the computer to its factory settings. I already backed everything up with time machine, but I would like to back it up to the cloud as well because I've had issues with time machine as well.\nOf the 15,000 photos I have, only 2,000 are uploaded to iCloud.

I currently have a Hornettek Enterprise Quad bay USB3 JBOD hooked up to a Mac Pro running Mavericks. It has two 3TB disks which are mirrored (RAID 1 using Disk Utility) and contain a mixture of personal data and media shared by the Mac Pro to an AppleTV. \nI’m fast approaching 3TB of data and need to consider expanding, most likely with another two 3TB drives to the JBOD.\nOnce I’ve added two new disks to the Hornettek JBOD I will have 4x3TB disks.  Using software RAID under OS X Mavericks, what is the best option to ensure redundancy and disk usage?\nA few years ago I used an OpenIndiana server to RAID-Z a few disks together, but gave that up for the simplicity of OS X only. But I guess it’s something like RAID-Z that I want, only a stable OS X solution. \n\nA: First of you you cannot expand a RAID-1 (Mirror). If you want to make a larger RAID array you will have to back up the drives and recreate the RAID array in a different configuration.\nOnce you have done that you have several configuration options with 4 disks. A quick google of types of RAID will show that... However if it were me I would set up the 4 3TB drives as a RAID-5. Yielding 9TB of disk space. That makes all disks in the enclosure part of the same array. \nThere is a problem with that though. Disk Utility will only give you RAID-0 or RAID-1 (non-redundant stripe or mirror). Which means that you would have to purchase a third party RAID utility to do RAID-5. There are a couple out there and I have heard they do a good job. Depending on your budget that would work well.\nYour other (no cost) option is to put the other two disks in your enclosure and just set them up as a second RAID-1 array. It won't give you the speed or as much space as a RAID-5 (6TB total usable space) but it will work just fine and show up on your Mac as a second volume.\n", "Q: Yosemite 10.10.4 nowhere to set three finger tap to access Dictionary I'm in OS X, and I bought my mac from one of my friends.

I was using it and installed programs that corresponded to programming or using C/C++ and used the terminal to compile it but will not be using it in a few months.\n\nA: According to the homebrew FAQ, to uninstall homebrew you use:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)\"\n\n\nIf you don’t want to completely uninstall home-brew but just want to remove all packages installed by homebrew, I think this will do what you need (I’m not currently in a position to remove all of my packages to check):\nwhile [[ `brew list | wc -l` -ne 0 ]]; do\n    for EACH in `brew list`; do\n        brew uninstall --force --ignore-dependencies $EACH\n    done\ndone\n\nThis will get a list of all the installed packages and loop over them removing one at a time, ignoring any dependencies.\nI’ve enclosed the whole thing in a loop double check that after the first run all of the packages have been uninstalled — I’m pretty sure they will be due to the --force and --ignore-dependencies options, but belt and braces...\n\nA: Here is what I used:\nfor f in `brew list`; do \n    brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies --force $f\ndone\n\n\nA: The answers didn't work for me, but the following did (Homebrew 2.4.9, Feb 17 2021):\nbrew list | xargs brew uninstall --force\n\nI also had a few casks installed, this removed them as well:\nbrew list --cask | xargs brew uninstall --force\n\n\nA: I usually just do\nbrew remove --force $(brew list --formula)\n\nand\nbrew remove --cask --force $(brew list)\n\n\nA: for f in `brew list --formula`; do \n    brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies --force $f\ndone\n\nBecause nowadays it requires brew list --formula or else you will get an error\nError: Invalid usage: this command requires a formula or cask argument\nJainav@Apples-MBP ~ % brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies --force --formula\nUsage: brew uninstall, rm, remove [options] formula|cask\n\nUninstall a formula or cask.\n\n  -f, --force                      Delete all installed versions of formula.\n                                   Uninstall even if cask is not installed,\n                                   overwrite existing files and ignore errors\n                                   when removing files.\n      --zap                        Remove all files associated with a cask.\n                                   May remove files which are shared between\n                                   applications.\n      --ignore-dependencies        Don't fail uninstall, even if formula is\n                                   a dependency of any installed formulae.\n      --formula, --formulae        Treat all named arguments as formulae.\n      --cask, --casks              Treat all named arguments as casks.\n  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.\n  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.\n  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.\n  -h, --help                       Show this message.\n\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to open 2 different instances of Chrome with different tabs open?

It will have been offered as the user hit a web page needing it & would require admin acceptance before it would install.\nMacKeeper is not so much malicious as insidious. It's is an 'all in one fixit' app with dubious marketing strategy.\nIt often 'features' on any page vaguely relevant to Mac care & maintenance, with the idea that it is the most obvious button to click, instead of the one you meant to.\nIn that respect it is a 'PUP' [potentially unwanted program] although no-one appears to have actually credited it with being intentionally malign - opinions on it are loud & varied.  \nNeither of these could have just sprung into the machine of their own accord, they would need user complicity, even if it was unintentional/misleading.\nYou'd have to let us know what the arbitrary media player is, to comment further.\n", "Q: Cut shortcut (cmd+x) doesn't work if I use the left cmd key (cmd+c does work with left cmd key!)?

The builtin keyboard on the rMBP does not behave this way.\n\nA: It may very well be that the Razer drivers are incompatable with OS 10.10 Yosemite.  According to Razer, it seems the latest driver only supports up to 10.7 Lion although the last modified date on the download site is 26 Mar 2015.\nOne fix may be to find and get the legacy drivers for your Razer device.

I did silence my iPhone, but when I activated sound again, Airplane Mode is on my Apple Watch.  I cannot get it off.  It is not activated on either my iPhone or Watch app.\n\nA: Airplane mode on Apple Watch, by default, mirrors the setting on your iPhone. When you disable Airplane mode on  your iPhone, it can not be mirrored to Apple Watch, because the radios on the watch are turned off. You need to disable Airplane mode on Apple Watch manually by using the interface on the Apple Watch.\nYou can disable the automatic mirroring of Airplane mode the following ways:\niPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the \"Apple Watch\" app\n\n*\"My Watch\"\n\n*\"General\"\n\n*\"Airplane Mode\"\n\n*Make sure the \"Mirror iPhone\" switch is turned off.\n\n\nApple Watch - \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the \"Settings\" app \n\n*\"Airplane Mode\".\n\n*Make sure the \"Airplane Mode\" switch is turned off.\n\n", "Q: Bash script - Delay cp command until after file write is complete cp /Folder1/*.mov /Folder2/\ncp /Folder1/*.mov /Folder3\nrm /Folder1/*.mov\n\nThis runs every 60 seconds using Chron that copies any *.mov file from one folder to 2 other folders and then removes the file.\nIf the file takes longer than 60 seconds to write the script executes and copies anything in the folder and corrupts it. (Or if the script just happens to execute when a file is being written.)\nHow can I make a conditional statement to make the script wait until the file write is complete?\n\nA: Lock File\nConsider creating a lock to note the ongoing copy, see lock your script (against parallel run):\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Path to a lock folder\nLOCK_PATH=\"/tmp/copying.lock\"\n\n# Ensure the lock is removed should the copy fail\ntrap 'rmdir \"/tmp/copying.lock\"; exit' 1 6 15\n\nif mkdir \"$LOCK_PATH\"; then\n    # Lock file did not exist and was created\n\n    # Perform commands\n    cp /Folder1/*.mov /Folder2/\n    cp /Folder1/*.mov /Folder3\n    rm /Folder1/*.mov   \n\n    # Remove the lock\n    rmdir \"$LOCK_PATH\"\nfi\n\nThe script above only copies if no folder exists at /tmp/copying.lock.\nCopy and Move\nInstead of copying directly to the final location, consider making the copy to a temporary location. Then move the files. A move is fast, tends to be atomic, and less likely to damage the files.\nAlternatively, you could copy using a tool like rsync which includes flags to help protect against these problems.\n", "Q: How do I tell if a device is doing USB 3.0 and not downgraded to USB 2.0 for some reason? For example, if I plug a USB 3.0 device and find that the I/O performance is rather slow, how do I check whether it's because the device is actually doing USB 2.0 (even though I'm using a USB 3.0 cable, connected to a USB 3.0 port on my MacBook Pro).\n\nA: Try  menu >  About this Mac > System Report...\nSelect USB on the left, then find your device in the list.\nThe reported speed ought to be a giveaway.

Strangely I'm greeted with the infamous spinning beach ball of death, and after a minute or two of the computer not responding I close the lid again.\nI then hear the boot sound, and thinking the computer simply crashed and rebooted I open the lid, only to see the flashing question mark folder.\nDoing some research I find that it means the computer can't find the boot drive, so I reboot into Internet recovery mode, and try to select the boot drive... Nothing's there. I then go to Disk Utility to try and see if I can repair the drive. All I find is the base system, to which I don't have write permissions, and as such am not allowed to repair or format.\nWhat do I do? I don't want to lose all the precious work I have on it, and I don't have a time machine for backups.\nIt's a late 2011 13 inch Macbook pro with 8 gb ram and a 2 tb hard drive\nNew Information:\nThe computer boots fine from the hard drive if I connect it via USB, so I suspect it might have something to do with the cable, but I'm not sure.\n\nA: It may be as simple as the cable has become loose.  If that is the case, it is a fairly easy fix.  Sorry to see you don’t have a backup.  If the drive has gone bad, that would have been your recourse.\nFor future reference, a simple external drive connected via USB will work fine as a Time Machine backup disk.  Even if you are not as regular in connecting it as you should, you would at least have a backup in case of catastrophic failure.  There are other online backup solutions too that are subscription based.\nIf you are comfortable with taking the MacBook apart, you can check the cables first.\n\nA: I'd try booting off of another hard drive with OS X on it and then using Disk Utility to try to repair the drive and/or its Disk Permissions. Maybe one of your friends has something you can barrow to use to boot your Mac off of (even an old OS X Lion USB stick).\n", "Q: Some messages only appear on my Mac I like being able to text off my MacBook.\nSometimes the responses don't go to my phone so I miss messages and only get them when I open my Mac. \nDoes anyone know how I can receive messages on my iPhone and my Mac?\n\nA: On your iPhone, go into Settings->Messages->Text Message Forwarding and switch the switch by your Mac off. Once off, switch it back on and then authenticate it on your Mac.\n\nA: It may have to do with your iMessage configuration.  \nOpen Messages and press cmd+, or go to Messages > Preferences to check if your Apple ID is the same on your iPhone and Mac, and below that, check the section titled: \"You can be reached for messages at:\" and confirm that your phone number appears and it's checked; this allows your Mac to receive iMessages sent to your phone.  \nThen go to the section below and select your phone number as the \"Start new conversations from:\" origin on the drop-down menu; this allows you to consolidate your sent iMessages from the same origin.\nHaving your email as the origin or destination is an option but it will result in iMessages sent by your Mac to create a different conversation thread than messages sent by your phone; iMessages answered to your email (instead of your phone) will only appear on your Mac, when you open it.\nSending SMS through your Mac is perfectly possible if you enable Continuity, but that shouldn't be confused with iMessage; the probable result of having your Mac with the lid closed when someone sends you an SMS is that only your phone will receive it, not the opposite.\n", "Q: How does TimeMachine store Calibre's metadata and backup files?

General note before getting into the Apple Watch:\nNo watch, not even a diver's watch, is \"waterproof\" in the sense that it can be taken to any depth of the ocean, no matter how abysmal, and remain intact, keeping out the water however there are certain standard degrees of water resistance. No watch is marketed as waterproof as far as I know; watches are marketed as water-resistant at the lowest level, and water resistant to XYZ depth for higher levels.\nWhat is the overall outlook regarding swimming and the Apple Watch?\n\nA: We really don't know what Apple has in store for the Apple Watch as far as waterproofing it. YouTube is full of guys who test their Apple Watch to see if is waterproof, they take it down to depths of ten feet and lower for a pretty long time and, though not very useful while underwater (due to pressure, the touch screen won't work also the heart rate sensor isn't always accurate), I've yet to see where the Apple Watch doesn't survive being taken underwater.\nI've never submerged my Apple Watch Sport, but it has gotten wet quite a few times and I've rinsed it off in the sink many times, too.\nGiven that the Apple Watch is almost waterproof today, I think that Apple just doesn't want to call it that for fear that they will have to replace any units that break when taken deep underwater.\n\nA: The “series 0” original Apple Watch: According to Apple:\nApple Watch has a water-resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529.\n\nIPX7, according to Wikipedia, means it's rated for immersion in water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. \n", "Q: Safari High Avg Energy Impact Under the Energy Monitor, it always shows high Average Energy Impact (1000+) for Safari. Is this normal? I have attached the screenshots. Although I formatted the entire disk and reinstalled the OS, the problem has not been fixed. What is the reason for this issue, and is it possible to fix it?\nNo plugin/extension is installed. It happens even if Safari is only displaying Google.\nMy environment: \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*Processor: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory: 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\n\n*Safari 8.0.7\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\nA: I'd simply ignore it. Energy Impact is just an arbitrary number showing how much energy an app is consuming (each instant and on average).\nActivity Monitor is simply telling you that the app which uses the most energy is Safari.\nTo make sure that Safari is not eating up on CPU, you can check the CPU usage over time, for example using a tool like 'uptime' from the command line (simply launch the Terminal an type uptime), this will tell you the uptime of the system and the load average over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes, this number should be close to (or less than) 1 on Yosemite. A load average constantly above 2 (or more) could indicate some process sucking up on CPU, which can found using Activity Monitor.\n", "Q: Can I redeem all my iTunes gift cards at once? For the past ever, I've been on my parents' Apple ID, making purchases on their credit cards and sharing any iTunes gift cards I redeemed with the family. However, I recently created my own Apple ID, complete with my own payment method. I'm tempted to upload every single gift card I have to my account. Is this doable, and are there any limitations to doing it?\n\nA: Yes - stacking gift cards is not an issue. You will just carry a larger balance and less risk of losing the cash value if you lose the redemption codes or physical cards. \nYou lose the flexibility to redeem them on another account. So if you’re not the family organizer, don’t redeem a balance or they will need to cut you from the family temporarily when you want to spend your credits. \nGifts do not redeem twice and you cannot transfer a balance to another Apple ID or get a cash refund. \n", "Q: iCloud password prompt on OS X Yosemite startup Whenever my MacBook Air starts up from shutdown (or on restart), once the Finder has started, it prompts me for my iCloud password, like this:\n\nAs you can see there is no title or anything to identify the app or process requesting the password. However, through the use of a clever Python script (unfortunately I can't remember where I got it from) I was able to determine the process requesting the password:\nUserNotificationCenter (/System/Library/CoreServices/UserNotificationCenter.app)\nIf I click Cancel twice (it pops up again after the 1st Cancel) it doesn't reappear and there are no apparent issues. All my iCloud services (Photos, Music, Contacts, Calendars, Keychain) seem to sync and work just fine.\nI used Activity Monitor to dump the processes open files and the only file of relevance I can see is /usr/share/icu/icudt53l.dat although I have no idea what it is.\nThe problem only started happening about a month ago, and there's no obvious change that occurred on my machine that I can think of that might have caused this.\nEDIT: obviously I tried entering my iCloud password, without success.\n\nA: If you have another Apple device, such as an iPad or iPhone, and you deleted iCloud off of it, it can disrupt every device you have, and you will just need to log in again, possibly generating App-Specific Passwords for your Mac. This happened to me around the same time, but I can't remember if it was the result of the upgrade to OS X 10.10.4 that broke the connection of it was when I deleted iCloud from my iPad (I was lending it to someone).\nYou may need to log iCloud in with your Apple ID password, or if that does not work, log in to your Apple ID and generate an App-Specific Password for iCloud. \nThe same problem cropped up for iMessage/Facetime as well. There you definitely need to generate an App-Specific Password, however I think I resolved the issue with iCloud by entering my Apple ID password. Once it sets in your Keychain, you shouldn't see the pop up again.\n\nA: I solved the problem just logging out and then logging in again in my Apple ID inside System Preferences/iCloud settings.\nDon't care about all the warnings about you will loose all your contacts and iCloud calendars if you log out.

I'm using the latest version of Photos on both of my iMacs, my iPhone, and two iPads.\nI'm also using iCloud for storage and syncing.\nSo far - everything seems to work - when I take a photo on my iPhone, it shows up on all my Macs and devices.\nHowever - what happens when I edit a photo in Photos on one of my iMacs? Does the edited photo show up on my other Mac and other devices? Also - if I \"favorite\" a photo in Photos - should that show up on my other devices?\n\nA: According to this Support article from 2016 the answer depends on how you sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you import photos from an iOS device to Photos over USB, the favorite status will not sync (!)\n\n*If you use iCloud Photo Library to sync across devices the favorite status will sync. \n\n\nSource: Apple Support - Q: iOS Photos to OSX Photos favorites sync\nFWIW this is totally offensive and horrible, I can hardly believe it.

Looking for a way to automatically collect iOS screenshots and add them to the Screeenshots album, but with high accuracy (trying to avoid false positives).\nIt's fairly simple to track down the various device resolutions, and that the camera was iPhone/iPad/iPod, etc. However, that doesn't really narrow it down, as those also include photos taken from the device, as well as wallpapers. Maybe in a future Photos.app update, these will update automatically. Just wondering if anyone can guess at the metadata criteria Apple uses, or if they simply place that image in the Screenshots folder by default.\nI highly doubt it, I wonder if you can pass in regex as a filename pattern. That would make it a lot easier.\n\nA: Screen captures do not have a camera on the metadata. You can use that to weed out most of the pictures as all pics taken with the integrated camera will state the iPhone model (and even if taken with the front or rear camera).\nSecond, as @bjbk said, all screen captures are .pngs.  \nI tried a text filter for each resolution, including one for landscape and another for portrait orientation. I couldn't reproduce the behavior described here, which states that it does not matter the order of the dimensions. You will have to track down each dimension pair relevant for your case.\nMoreover, I couldn't catch all screen captures when adding this filter; in a seemingly random fashion, some pictures were correctly selected for each resolution pair and others with the same resolution didn't.\nI checked the metadata on Adobe Bridge to find out what was the difference between images but could not find any.\nAlso important, the dimensions of the screen capture differ from the dimensions of photos taken with the device: \niPhone 6:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen captures: 1334 × 750\n\n*Pictures with rear camera: 3264 × 2448\n\n*Pictures with front camera: 1280 × 960\n\n\nSo that won't be a problem for filtering; anyway, the Text filter did not work as expected.\nAll in all, a filter made by selecting Filename - ends with - .png AND Filename - starts with - IMG_ AND Camera Model - is empty gave me the best results.\nI didn't try regex because I can't get my head around it; I've had some success following guides when I find which version / syntax is appropriate for the case at hand and a good guide, but I don't really understand it.\n", "Q: Paralells Reports Missing Operating System with Windows 10 bootcamp Partition I've installed Windows 10 Release Candidate on a brand new SSD drive.

One of my planned uses of the Apple Watch was to use the Haptic technology to make a discreet tap on the hour and 20 minute marks, to gauge appointment times. But I was dumbfounded to see that Apple has not built any kind of a chime into the Apple Watch!\nDoes anyone know of an App or strategy that can do that without setting up hundreds of reminder or calendar notifications?\n\nA: By using the recurring event feature, you can manage them as less than 24 events. iCloud manages this efficiently.

This screen shot is of the dialog for creating a new virtual machine.\n\nIf you can't find instructions for going from the El Capitan .app to a VirtualBox VM, you may want to follow directions for doing so with Yosemite and hope they work. This guide worked for me.\nUpdate Another idea: Use the above-linked guide to get Yosemite working in VirtualBox, and then upgrade to the beta from within the VM. I just tried this, and it worked for me. \n\nNote that VirtualBox doesn’t seem to have any integration software for OS X, so you can't do things like drag to change the guest OS resolution, or enable clipboard sharing, unless I’m really missing something!\n\nA: I was able to follow this tutorial and get El Capitan up and running with only a few snags:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Step 5 I think there is something wrong with the syntax to remove the broken link, I ended up just opening it in finder and trashed it.\n\n*There's a bit of a typo on Step 7, some of the html got stuck in the expression\n\n\nBesides that it all seems to be working so far :)\n\nA: There is a new option now which is the easiest: Parallels Light, which is free when running Mac or Linux OS, available from the App Store. Perfect for this type of job.\n\nA: The high level, brief answer is that you should run the beta software on bare metal for best results. I'm not aware of any virtualization package that supports El Capitan yet (hours after it was announced). \nSurely the vendors will update their tools in time, but in general, I don't think VirtualBox has the best support of any OS X as a guest operating system when running on Mac hardware due to it being focused on multiple host OS compatibility as opposed to a Mac centric design. \n", "Q: How to prevent Windows 10 from downloading and installing updates before the Boot Camp Support Software is installed? Microsoft is allowing users to download and install (but not activate) Windows 10 Pro 64 bit without using a Product key. \nI tried doing a clean install of Windows 10 on my mid 2007, 20 inch iMac.

You may want to check if a better choice exists than the default keyboard.\nAt this point, you can continue with the Windows 10 installation.\nAdditional Notes:\nThere is a downloadable \"Show or hide updates\" troubleshooter package from Microsoft, that will allow you to review and/or hide updates before downloading and/or installing. This option is described in an answer to \"Stopping automatic updates windows 10\".\nPersonally, I found this software to be unpredictable. I could get the software to hide an update, but I had trouble getting a hidden update to install.\n\nA: Where to start…? … \nThis is the current picture as I understand it, & may be subject to change/correction\nTo get your 'free' Win 10 you must upgrade an existing activated installation, otherwise you will have to enrol in the Insider Program when it reopens to continue to use it [or keep installing fresh every month to a VM that cannot be identified as being the 'same machine'] \nIf you install clean from the Media Creator tool on an external USB key etc, you may not be able to get past the 'enter a Win 10 key' screen. People have had varying results at that point, some get the 'skip' button, some do not. [I have yet to figure out what causes this difference]\nUpgrading an existing Win 7 or 8 OS would also at least keep the existing Boot Camp drivers in place - possibly better than trying to inject outdated drivers after the fact.\nThere are no Boot Camp drivers yet for Win 10. \nAlso, unless you are using Win 10 Enterprise [which has no free upgrade path], you cannot switch off automatic updates, only defer them til next reboot.\n\nA: TO prevent windows from updating automatically, you have to make sure that windows update service is disabled.

I want to start it over I want to start Gardian Hunter from the start, but I can't delete my data.\nIs it possible to delete it? Please help me.\nI'm using an iPhone 5.\n\nA: You should just be able to delete the app and redownload it again, all game data should be deleted, then.\n\nA: App data is not stored in the app store only the game is. If game data is stored on the phone only then deleting the app, rebooting the phone, and downloading the app will clear it. \nIf the game data is stored on the game developer's server then you will have to ask the game developer how to clear it, or better create a new user ID for the game.\n\nA: Unfortunately this operation can not be done without removing the App on an non-jailbroken iDevice. \nFor  your safety, I suggest to remove the app as following: \nNavigate to Settings => General => Usage => Manage Storage => Select the desired game/app => Delete App\nThis will clear all cache info for the app and when you install it over, you may be able to start from scratch. \nBeside that some games/apps store info onto their own servers and/or in the GameCenter. \nFor the games/apps that store the info onto their own servers you will not need to worry, but for the ones that store info in the GameCenter, you may need to look how to reset your score/info there.\n", "Q: How create a smart playlist that shows only full albums in my library? Does anyone know how to create a iTunes Playlist that shows only songs in My Library which are part of a complete album in My Library.\nEssentially I want to see all my complete albums. You can in Spotify but with Apple Music every song you add to a playlist it assumes you want it added to My Library.\n\nA: There is no way to automate this functionality in iTunes today.  To do so, the system would need to know how many songs were in each album and that isn't immediately available.  Plus, what if you have an album with twelve songs and you only have eleven, but you still want it in the list.  Or what about singles that have only one or two songs.  Are these \"complete\" albums?\nIn any case, the only way I know to do this is to mark complete albums manually.\nFor example, you could put a note in \"Comments\" like \"CompleteAlbum\" and build a playlist for all files with Comments that contain \"CompleteAlbum\".  If you want to stay out of the comments, you could use the Disc X of Y, clearing the Disc # for non-album tracks and setting it to 1 (or 2 or whatever) for albums.  Then, you build a playlist that looks for songs with Disc # >= 1.  It's up to you.\nYou just have to remember to do that for each album you add, but your playlist would contain all your 'complete albums'.\n\nA: I don't have a full answer for this, but I eliminated about 200 songs from my latest Smart Playlist (e.g., 2017 songs) by adding criteria of Album does not contain text \"Single\". There's unfortunately no filter for \"of\" field for total count of tracks, because then you could filter out anything where this is set to 1 (1 of 1 tracks, vs. 1 of 13 on an album, for example).\n\nA: Apple has released a fix for this. In Settings>Music it lets you toggle between showing playlist songs in library or not. \n", "Q: Sharing non iTunes music on family sharing my question is can you share music from you iTunes library if you put it on there from a CD.

Is there any way I can get the file. \nThanks \n\nA: One way around downloading any version of OS X that's not supported on the physical hardware is to download it in a virtual machine, on the unsupported system, that's running a version of OS X that supports the downloading of the version of OS X being downloaded. I did this using VMware Fusion.  The virtual hardware presented in the virtual machine allowed for this as the App Store did see the physical hardware and the virtual hardware presented was adequate for the OS X version being downloaded.\nI had to do this with downloading OS X Mountain Lion in a virtual machine on a physical machine (MacBook Pro 15-inch Core 2 Duo) which only supported up to Mac OS X 10.7.5.  I needed to do this to create a USB installer of OS X Mountain Lion to be used on a MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013 to create an image of the SSD before the OS had been run directly from the SSD for the first time.  In other words to create a factory sealed image, so-to-speak.\nOtherwise you'll need to do as Tetsujin suggested, \"...get someone else with a newer Mac to DL it for you...\".\n", "Q: How to export multiple PDF pages into 1 PDF I have opened all of my PDF's in Preview (Mac).

The PDF's I have combined vary in size.\n\nA: Open, in Preview, the documents you wish to combine and select: View > Thumbnails\nDo this for each document.\nChoose one of the documents that will become the (temporary) container document in which you'll drag and drop thumbnails from other documents to create the combined document.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that when dragging and dropping thumbnails into the document, being use to create the combined document, that the thumbnails are dropped either in-between other thumbnails or always above the horizontal grey line that signifies the end of the original document.  If the Thumbnail view shows more then one document title the pages will not be combined. See image below.\n\n\nRearrange thumbnails as needed/wanted.\nOnce you have what will be the combined document ready, you can then choose how you want to save this combined document. \nYou could simple save it as is at this point, using File > Save, although it will overwrite the original document you used to be the container document.\nIf you do not want to overwrite the original document press the control key as you click the File menu and select: Save As...\nYou could also choose to print it as a PDF Document although using Save or Save As... should be sufficient.  To print as a PDF click, File > Print...

Recently I changed the storage to an SSD and with that change I started to set up iMessage. At first iMessage worked for a decent period of time I was getting texts on time and sending them through my Mac just fine. About a week ago suddenly I couldn't send any messages without getting the \"Not Delivered\" and that red exclamation mark. Going through pages of forums many of the problems were either a year old or older and were very repetitive. It was either delete some files through Keychain Access, restart something or turn on the message forwarding.\nUpdate: After playing around I realized that I can send messages to some of my contacts. These contacts are people who don't have this red highlight on their names and if they do have their name highlighted in red then I cannot send messages to them. \nUpdate2: After looking through imessage on my mac I realized that all the contacts that I cannot send to have usually been sent through text not imessage since their text bubbles are green. The ones I can send to are blue. \nI just want to know how to fix my current problem.\n\nA: What you are trying to do is send SMS messages from Messages on your Mac to people without iOS devices, correct?

I've got a 2009 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.5.7 and a Synology Diskstation ds215j.  I've successfully set up a user for Time Machine on the NAS and have successfully performed backups.\nHowever, this only works over wifi!  When I connect [my Mac] to my router via Ethernet cable, Time Machine fails to find the disk.  Both DHCP addresses (wired and wireless) are on the same subnet, which is the same subnet as the NAS.\nCan anybody tell me why?!\n\nA: I believe the issue you are referring to is the fact that the only drives that you are allowed to use as a time machine are ones that are internal to a Apple router, the only way for this to work is if you had an Airport Time Capsule which has a built in hard-drive. That is the only drive Time Machine supports connected to your router. \nBasically you CANNOT use a drive hooked-up via ethernet to your router for Time Machine. You have to have a Airport Time Capsule and use the internal hard drive. That is why when you connect your NAS Time Machine does not recognize the drive. \n", "Q: Use iMac 27\" in Target Display Mode with Raspberry Pi I have this little box called the Kanex XD HDMI to Mini-Displayport converter. It works perfectly with a lot of machines (tried it with a Macbook, PS4 and Xbox 360), but some devices don't seem to be supported and I'm wondering why.\n\nOne of the devices is the Playstation 3. I know the PS3 has trouble with its resolution, which means you have to reset holding some buttons etc. etc., but even that doesn't get it to work on my iMac in Target Display Mode.\nThe most recent problem I've run into is with the Raspberry Pi. Yesterday, I installed Raspbian on it while it was connected to my tv. This worked perfectly, if we ignore the weird resolution of 18##x9##.\nWhich made me wonder: Does the iMac only work as an external display in TDM if the device changes its own output video to 1280*720? Does anyone know a bit more about this function of the 27\" iMacs 2010 (and any iMac after 2011 if I remember) who can explain how exactly TDM works or is supposed to work?\n\nA: What I have found out is that TDM (Target Display Mode) on my mid 2010 27\" iMac only works with the following resolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*720p (1280*720) or lower\n\n*Native (2560*1440)\n\n\nAny device that tries to output something in between, gets a signal it has to change it's resolution to 1280*720. Many devices can automatically do this (Xbox 360, PS4), but some can not (PS3, Raspberry Pi). This means that, if you want to use a device that can't automatically change resolution, you have to set the right resolution BEFORE you connect it to the iMac with TDM.\nFor the Raspberry pi, this means you have to use the following two lines in your config.txt:\nhdmi_group=1 // VGA 60Hz\nhdmi_mode=4 // 720p\n\nRead more about the config-file here.\nSince the Raspberry Pi doesn't support 2560*1440 (it does support 2560*1600 though), you won't be able to use the iMacs beautiful 1440p-screen to its full potential, but at least it works!\nIf I ever find a solution to add a custom resolution, I'll update my answer.\n", "Q: Can I use a Walmart iPhone 5c charger instead of the original one I got a new charger at Walmart and it does not charge the phone. Is it because it is cheap?\n\nA: When buying an iPhone charger what you want to look for is the lightning cable (the one for your 5C) having a MFI-Certification, this means that it is certified by Apple to work (most likely). These may be more expensive but are better than the .99 gas station chargers. It may still work for a while buy there is a fairly high chance it won't or it will die after just a few weeks. Your best bet is a more expensive one from a place like Amazon or one sold at an actual Apple store.\nTo answer your question, cheap chargers are not nearly as good and could not end up working.\n\nA: basicly my family is a bit frugal and we tried all of the chargers; third party ones and the super cheap \"certified\" ones.  My advice is to get the apple one or a very nice one like http://www.amazon.com/MOS-Spring-Lightning-Cable-Exoskeleton/dp/B00XZ8DYM0/ref=sr_1_15?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1438736350&sr=1-15-spons&keywords=lightning%20cable\n\nA: No - cheap doesn't cause problems. Expensive also can fail, it's probably just a failure you can address by returning the adapter to the seller.\n", "Q: How do you get a Cisco VPN connection to remember its password? The Problem\nI've got a Cisco IPSEC VPN connection in my network settings on a Yosemite machine. It works fine, aside from prompting for a password on every single connection. The saved password is ignored entirely.\nBackground\nIf I enter the password under the network settings and click connect, the saved password vanishes, and the dialog prompting for a password appears. I've verified that the password is correct (it's copy-pasted from a document).\nThings that didn't work\n\n\n*\n\n*A suggested solution to this for Snow Leopard was to save the password, open Keychain Access, locate the \"Xauth\" key in the system keychain, and grant /usr/libexec/configd access to the key. This had no effect.\n\n*Usual permissions repair/disk check stuff\nWeird stuff\nIf I watch keychain access while hitting the connect button, the saved password vanishes outright from the keychain right when the dialog appears.\nOverall Question\nHow do I get the password correctly saved so I don't have to rekey it on every connection?\n\nA: Both answers here as I write this have the right of it, but the existence of the vpn command line means that we can get around this user-hostile design with expect. Thanks go to the previous answerers, GhostLyrics for revealing the existence of the server side option that turns off password saving, and Hans for revealing the vpn command line client.\nCreate a file that looks like this:\n#!/usr/bin/expect --\nset timeout 10\nset addr \"\"  # VPN Host\nset user \"\"  # Username\nset pass \"\"  # Password (ensure that special characters are escaped)\nset group \"\" # Group NUMBER shown in connect prompt\n\n\nspawn /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect $addr\nexpect \"\\r\\nGroup:*\"\nsend -- \"$group\\r\"\nexpect \"\\r\\nUsername:*\"\nsend -- \"$user\\r\"\nexpect \"Password: \"\nsend -- \"$pass\\r\"\nexpect eof\n\nFill out the set fields as normal. If your VPN is like mine, you're given a list of \"groups\" when you run the vpn connect. Run this once by hand, and note which number corresponds to the group you want to connect with. It won't change between runs unless the admins add/remove groups. You can't use the name here, the program expects a number.\nOnce everything is filled in, chmod +x this script and run it. I am now able to connect to my VPN, hands free!\n\nA: \nFreewheeling off Hans' answer —thanks!— I wanted to streamline the invocation a bit, bypassing Terminal and ending up with the AnyConnect icon in the macOS Status Menu. (I'm on Mojave 10.14.6.)\nFirst, launch Terminal, then change to the AnyConnect application binary's directory:\n$ cd \"/Applications/Cisco/Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.app/Contents/MacOS\"\n\nMake a copy of the original binary:\n$ sudo cp \\\n\"Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\" \\\n\"Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.orig\"\n\nFinally, overwrite the initial file with a shell script, changing VPN host to your VPN hostname or address and user and pa$$w0rd to your credentials:\n$ sudo cat > \"Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\" <<'SCRIPT'\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# The AnyConnect vpn utility takes some options and commands or else runs\n# interactively.\n# Its help command shows that -s reads a script from STDIN and that connect\n# takes a host as argument.\n# Further, the connect command takes the username and password from STDIN; we\n# will supply them from a heredoc with the -s option.\n\n/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn -s \\\nconnect \"VPN host\" <<'CREDENTIALS'\nuser\npa$$w0rd\nCREDENTIALS\n\nexec \"$0.orig\"  # invoke the original app\nSCRIPT\n\nNow, you should be able to run AnyConnect from Spotlight or Finder just as usual. First our script will connect and then hand off execution to the app binary so AnyConnect will appear on the desktop Status Menu.\n\nA: Security can be bolstered by using Keychain Access to store the password.\nsecurity add-generic-password -s 'vpnpassword'  -a 'user' -w 'password' -T /usr/bin/security\n\nHere is the adjusted version of Christian's idea. Removing the internal heredoc quotes is required for parameter expansion to work.\nsudo cat > \"Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\" <<'SCRIPT'\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn -s \\\nconnect \"VPN host\" <<CREDENTIALS\nuser\n$(security find-generic-password -ws vpnpassword)\nCREDENTIALS\n\nexec \"$0.orig\"  # invoke the original app\nSCRIPT\n\n\nA: I guess you are using anyconnect to connect to the Cisco VPN server. AnyConnect can also be used from Terminal. This works on macOS Sierra and AnyConnect 3.1.14018. Create a bash script with the following command:\n/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect your-vpn.server.here -s <.credentials\n\nAnd put the login details in the file .credentials with the following three lines:\n0\nyour-username\nyour-password\n\nDon't forget to put reasonable permissions on the files.\n\nA: From reading your question I get the impression that you're doing everything correctly and the Cisco VPN Server has the option to allow saving of passwords client-side set to disallow.\nI know for certain that such a setting exists.\n", "Q: Allowing cookies from a specific site in Safari I'm a new Mac user and I have a financial site which says I must allow cookies...and I'm okay with that, I just don't know how to do that.

If a large file is being written though I don't want it to run until the file write is complete.\nIm realizing more of what can be done with bash and I want to automate more processes as well. \n\nA: Fixing the Lock Removal\nTry using rmdir to remove the lock folder:\nrmdir \"$LOCK_PATH\"\n\nDebugging Paths\nTo debug the cp paths, try this command in Terminal.app:\nopen /Volumes/PROOFS_WATCH/\n\nDoes the expected folder open? Play around with the path until open displays the expected folder in the Finder.\nTo debug the lock folder, try running the script in two Terminal.app windows. Do they both try and copy? Trying adding an else statement to see if mkdir is working as desired:\n…\nelse\n    echo \"Lock exists.\"\nfi\n\nDebugging Shell Scripts\nTake a look at How to Add Error Checking to Your Shell Scripts to help identify any problems.\nHard Links\nMentioned in comments below is a new constraint: other applications may be writing the files as this script is running. This script can not block other applications changing or writing to the affected folders.\nIf a file is being written to, then the cp will only see and copy a partial file. The next time the script runs, the file will likely be fully available and copy correctly. This may or may not be acceptable.\nIf the copy occurs on the same physical volume, the copy can likely be avoided. In place of a copy, consider creating a hard link with the ln tool:\nln <source_file> <target_file>\nln [-Ffhinsv] <source_file> ... <target_dir>\n\nThe link does not copy any data and is almost instant. Changing either the original file or the newly hard linked file will be reflected in both.\nTry creating a hard link by hand before attempting to change the script:\nln /Volumes/PROOFS_WATCH/movie.mov /Volumes/PROOFS_WATCH/AME_Processing/movie.mov\n\n", "Q: Why is my camera not working? \nI don't know why my camera is not working, I am sure it is a software problem, it just shows a black page.

When I am copying files on a Macintosh, I notice that the folder says that its Modified/Created timestamp is 24 January 1984 08:00. Why is this particular timestamp is used? Is it something to do with when Mac OS X was first released?\n\nA: January 24, 1984 is the date that the first Macintosh went on sale.\nApple do love their easter eggs...\n\nA: It is the Mac's birthday.\nJan. 24, 1984, was the date Jobs took to the stage to show off the very first Macintosh in a live demonstration.

I recently bought a 2009 macbook that I thought would have a 2.4GHz processor (along with 4GB of RAM) but instead has a 2.26GHz processor with 2GB of RAM. (I expected it to be 2011.) I got it fairly cheap so I'm not entirely surprised, and the seller takes the blame for sending the wrong one out, but doesn't have any replacements and I really can't afford to buy another one even after a refund (shipping prices, ugh.) \nThe laptop itself is fine, and I wouldn't mind keeping the 2009 version if it wasn't for the specs. Is there a way to increase the processor speed without breaking the bank? I bought the laptop in the hopes that it'd be able to run (mainly) PS CS5 and the sims 4. This only fulfills one of those tasks, and is actually slower than the 2007 model I had before, which had 4 GB of RAM. I can take care of the RAM issue, but I really do need the better processor. Thanks!\n\nA: Sorry, the MacBook Pro processor is soldered on and removing it would likely destroy the logic board. I still have a 2009 MacBook Pro and it's fine, not to say that I wouldn't want a newer MacBook, though.\nBtw: Get an SSD for it. Replacing the hard drive with one cut boot up time in half for me. I personally recommend Intel.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s is giving me trouble, can someone help me troubleshoot? I thought my Hotmail account that I use my for my Apple ID was deleted but it was not. In the mean time I created a new Apple ID using the wrong e-mail. I never verified the new e-mail but its popping up on my iPhone everytime I try to update certain apps, even when I go to my SoundCloud I can't seem to find the fake e-mail. However it pops up when I try to update certain apps, what can I do to resolve this issue?\n\nA: You have two different issues:\nFor the Hotmail issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since we don't want to use this account and use the new one, they are still registered with the old Apple ID. To get them with the new Apple ID, you will need to delete the app and redownload the app with the new Apple ID\n\n\nFor the wrong email entered issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to appleid.apple.com\n\n*Choose manage my account\n\n*Sign in with the email as it was typed in incorrectly\n\n*It will say it is not verified and will give you an edit option on the side of the email address\n\n*Type in the correct email\n\n*Verify your account for the new Apple ID\n\n\nI would correct the issue with the new Apple ID first. Then: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings> iTunes and App Store option.\n\n*Tap on the Apple ID logged in\n\n*Choose sign out\n\n*Sign in with the corrected Apple ID\n\n\nThen delete the apps and redownload with the new Apple ID\n", "Q: Can You \"Turn Off\" Order of Preference For Wi-Fi Networks As far as my MacBook is concerned, I have 3 Wi-Fi Networks in my house, with different names (it is actually one network, with 2 repeaters). I move around the house and frequently use the 2 repeaters in particular. Quite often I lose connection to one of the repeaters, and my laptop will reconnect, but possibly to the farther repeater with a weaker signal, depending on the order of preference set in advanced network preferences. Because this signal may be quite weak, I may lose Internet connection using this Wi-Fi repeater, but my laptop will not try to connect to the repeater with the stronger signal.\nThe only way to get round this is to continually change my network preferences whenever I move around the house, which is very annoying.\nIs there any way I can get my laptop to have no preference between the two repeaters, and to connect to which ever has the stronger signal?\nThis is not a duplicate question because the other question is asking how to enable an order of preference on an iphone and this question is asking how to disable it on a Macbook. Not surprisingly, none of the answers there answer my question.\n\nA: No, not without special functionality on the accesspoints themselves.\nThe thing you are referring to is called wireless roaming, something that usually can't be done with simple consumer hardware.\nAs for OS X, it only reconnects when the current connection is lost. If you can make sure there is no overlap between the accesspoints or repeatets, the connection will always be lost and then you will switch to the next network. This might be possible in your situation if your repeaters or accesspoints allow you to reduce it's radio power in it's settings.\n", "Q: Can Numbers create stacked column charts with two columns for each category? I'm trying to create a column chart in Numbers where each column is also stacked. For example, consider the following data.\n\nHere we have numbers for the total sample and numbers for how that total is actually the average of two segments. I've already graphed a stacked column chart of the total sample, which looks something like this:\n\nNow I'm trying to create a chart that shows the differences in the segments while also displaying the stacks for each individual segment. For the above data, it might look something like this:\n\nI've successfully created the column charts in Numbers that show the total sample stacked or that show the segments, but unstacked. I'm trying to create one that shows the segments comparison with the stacked totals.\nIs this possible in Numbers? Excel? Or should I just do it manually (which will really suck, because eventually I'm going to have dozens of these) in OmniGraffle?\n\nA: EDIT (Complete revision):\nBased on your data, the only way to accomplish this without redesigning the table is to create separate charts for each Segment shown.  As each segment has 4 pieces of data, this is the only way to do this.  (There may be someone out there who is a charting expert that could do much better, I'm sure)\nFirst, as you have done is to make a Total chart:\n\nThen crate separate charts, positioned together for the segments:\n\nThe charts can be edited for looks and data views in the Inspector but that is beyond the scope of the question.\n", "Q: How to transfer data from one iCloud account into a new one? Since approximately 2009, my mother, brother, and I have all shared the same Apple ID and therefore, iCloud. Each of us have our separate devices, computers, and different music, apps, contacts, and other data on them. It's been really messy and generally a pain to try and make our stuff separate when we share the same cloud and everything. Now my brother and I want to get our own separate accounts, but we don't want to have to repurchase over 500 songs and 170+ apps, move around thousands of pictures, reenter our contacts, etc, etc...\nIs there any way we can transfer our individual data to a new iCloud account on our respective devices? I feel it should be as simple as signing into the device with one Apple ID, downloading what I want, and then signing back in with my new Apple ID where everything will download. But knowing Apple and my luck with technology it probably won't be that simple.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: You can create individual iCloud IDs and keep the old ID as store ID, common for every user. That way you won't have to purchase everything again and still the data within your apps will remain different as your iCloud IDs are different.\nOptionally, you can just create two more IDs and use family sharing with the first ID to share all your purchased content.\nTo transfer your data like contacts, notes etc. configure the old iCloud ID on a new device and when everything is synced just delete the iCloud ID. It should ask if you want to delete all your data from the device. Select \"No\". Then configure your new iCloud ID from iCloud settings and now it will ask if you want to \"merge\" all data.\n\nA: In this situation, you can try to backup your data to iTunes. First, log in your own Apple ID on your own Apple devices.Next, connect your devices to computer, launch iTunes. And then restore your own backup. Finally, log in your own iCloud account on your Apple devices and use iCloud to backup your data. Now you have transferred your individual data to a new iCloud account on your respective devices. \n\nA: If you each set up separate accounts, then all join Family Sharing, this would allow you to each re-download any app, song, movie, book etc purchased by the 'family'. \nYour individual Contacts details, Calendar, progress in games etc would all be lost in this transition, except for the Family Organiser, who would still have access to the original data.\nMoving this data would have to be done manually. I'm afraid Apple IDs were never meant to be shared in this way until the advent of Family Sharing & there is no easy path for migration of individual data from account to account.\n", "Q: OS X Traceroute Command: what is '*' Using the traceroute command in  OS X 10.9.x, multiple '*' characters are printed as output. Can anyone explain exactly what these are and what they mean?\nCommand output example: \ntraceroute to www.google.com (xxx.xxx.xx.xxx), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets\n 1  * * *\n 2  * * *\n 3  * * *\n 4  * * *\n 5  * * *\n 6  *\n\n\nA: That means traceroute didn't get any responses to its probes. The way it works is that it sends out test packets set to expire after 1 hop, two hops, etc; then it listens for \"sorry, but your packet expired before I could deliver it\" and prints the addresses of the routers that sent those responses. The \"*\"s mean it didn't hear back.\nYou're getting all \"*\"s, which means that either there's no route to the destination, or there's a firewall blocking the probes and/or the responses, or something along those lines.\n", "Q: Where exactly is the Google Chrome sync passphrase? Where exactly is the Google Chrome sync passphrase? I need it to enable sync between various devices. I've looked through keychain and haven't seen anything that exactly matches.\n\nA: I have an entry called GoogleContactSyncService which is an application password, then I have a Google Chrome Sync Passphrase which is stored as a secure note, but I may have added that. Try the former.\nIf this isn't it, then it is likely an application specific password. Go to your Google Account, revoke the prior Authorization and then generate a new password. If the one I said above isn't it then I have a feeling that what happens is that when you enter the passphrase it generates a much larger authorization token from it which is stored in keychain. The app password doesn't get stored.\nUpdate\nI think that you needed to record it, which is likely why I have a secure note in my keychain where I stored the passphrase when I set it up. If you didn't do something similar, or write it down when you set up, then you won't have it. \nWhat is on your computer is the encryption key that is generated by a key derivation function (password hash). Basically you enter the passphrase and the function creates a large, pseudorandom private key with the passphrase as the seed for the random function, though Chrome's algorithm is likely more complex than that. Enter the same passphrase into the function and the resulting key will return the same key. However you shouldn't be able to go in reverse and use the key to generate the passphrase.\nThere is a possibility that if you didn't choose to use a different passphrase that it will be your Google account login password. If you have change your Google account password, try the older passwords to see if that was the one used as the passphrase. If you generated an app specific password and you didn't record it then the synced data is locked. You will have to reset and start from scratch.\n", "Q: Office 2016 beta on Mac I have coworkers that are using many features that are in office 2013, 2016 for Windows,  and I want to get office 2016 for Mac. I don't have office 365, I just want the local version. \nHow can I get it? \n\nA: Office 2016 for Mac has a stable release available for Office 365 subscribers. It'll be available as a standalone purchase at some unspecified date in September. Until then, it looks like Microsoft has taken their beta down. What you could do is wait as long as you can bear to live without Office and then sign up for a free trial of Office 365, and then unsubscribe and buy Office 2016 once it comes out in September.\n", "Q: An app in iPhone shows in the list of apps sharing documents (list below), but it does not show in the general list (list above) I have an iPhone 4s, iOS 7.1.2, plugged to my Pc. iTunes 12.1.2 is running, and I am seeing the apps in my device.\nOn the right of the main screen there are copies of the icons as shown in the iPhone.\nOn the left there are two lists of apps. The top list shows all apps. The bottom list shows the apps that can share documents (and clicking on an app one can see the stored documents for it).\nI have at least one app (Foxit Reader) that shows in the bottom list and not in the top one, which is unexpected. I do not know if there are other apps in the iPhone that do not show in the top list.\nAny idea of the cause, and how to solve it?\nI found another problem, which I think is related to this one.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/198927/itunes-backup-not-all-apps-backed-up\n\nA: The apps not showing were purchased under a different Apple ID. I had to logout from the current ID in iTunes, and login with the other ID. Then I could Transfer purchases (which included those other apps).\n", "Q: Can you save a work session and reopen it later? Imagine you are working on a book, for which you need 5 precise internet tabs/pages to be open at the same time, Apple Pages, Dictionary, and, I don't know, a classical music CD in iTunes that inspires you.\nAnd on the same day, you will also work on your finances and accounting, for which you will need Numbers, Calculator and three tabs open in a browser.\nAnd you're also helping your kids put together a video for their school, so whenever you work on it, you need to have Final Cut Pro X, the TextEdit file corresponding to the project, and 4 images/visual resources opened in Preview.\nThese are tasks that might take a week or two to get done. So every time you're going to get to work on one of them, you're going to have to spend a long time finding the right documents, source files, and recreating the work environment that you need to be ready to work. And if you are interrupted, or wish to shut down your computer or close the task at hand, you'll have to go save and close in every application.\nMy question is, does anyone know of a way to simplify opening and closing all the files related to long term projects? Obviously no one turns on their computer to write a novel from A to Z. And no one does \"just one thing\" on a computer as well. Maybe there is an app that exists that launches a very precise work environment for you? \n\"Spaces\" is good, but what I'm talking about would be a way to save every little setting within a space, and be able to close or reopen or name them (and Spaces has been replaced by Mission Control anyways).\nThe only way I think someone could do this is by creating aliases of the files related to one task, then select all aliases and reopen them each time (might not work for browser tabs?)\nLet me know I would love an answer to this, as I often work on several long term projects in the same year and need to take breaks, or turn off and on my computer often.\n\nA: For what you are asking, using the sleep image might be the best way.\nCreating a little script one could do that with Sleep Image.\nFirst you would imitate the sleep that would create a image of your current state.\npmset sleepnow\n\nor\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep'\n\nNext you would copy/rename the sleep image file so you can use it later.\nThey are located in the /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nBe aware the sleep image files can be large in Gigabyte size, so make sure you have enough disk space.\n", "Q: Cursor movement to beginning/end of line in iOS - possible?

All I see are games with empty stars and no reviews.\nI made the new account Mongolian because I'am Mongolian the old one I made the region USA. just in CA.\n\nA: The problem might be the change of store.\nSmaller stores don't have enough reviews to show. Look for a very popular app (Facebook, Snapchat) and you may see reviews, but even then, it may happen that there are not enough reviews for the current version. You can switch to see the reviews for all versions, that may have enough data to be shown.\nOr you can switch stores; to do that, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store > Apple ID, enter your password, and tap on Country / Region to Chang your store back to the U.S.\nIf you have iTunes Match or Apple Music subscriptions running, you'll have to cancel them first.\n", "Q: Virus from adult websites?

If it is neither of those things (which the fan thing is unlikely so you have to decipher wether or not is it the screen) I would take it into an Apple store. It is most likely a minor issue like a loose screw or the like but if it is under warranty and there is an Apple store near by there is no harm.\n\nA: Sameee!!!!

However it does sync if I put an event into the iPhone when it will then pick up the previous unsynced events.\n\nA: I have found that creating a \"dummy\" calendar event on my iPhone will unjam synching issues and force OS X and iOS systems to talk to each other. This is not a very elegant method, but it's effective. Simply delete the fake entry when your Mac and iPhone have shared their respective calendars.\n\nA: I tried the solutions and none worked for me; iPhone 5S sync with MacBook Pro High Sierra; I rebooted both devices; what worked was to go on iPhone Settings -> First icon (my name) then scroll down to iPhone(3) (the name of my iPhone - could be different for you) clicking on which solved the problem - at least for now.  \n\nA: I've had this issue recently as well.

This has worked for me so far.\n\nA: Recent versions of iOS and OS X support many calendar service providers, and within them you may have different calendars for each category: Work, Personal, Family, etc.\nCheck on all synced devices that the same calendars are activated and visible.\nOn iOS, open the Calendar app, tap on Calendar, and select those you'd like to be visible.\nOn OS X, you can do the same on the sidebar.\nCheck the calendar (Work, Personal, etc.) of the event that won't sync. \nSometimes all it takes is to make the calendar viewable on all devices.\n\nA: This has been driving me crazy too. No matter what I tick in preferences, my iPhone calendar will not update/sync with my iMac.

What is the difference between issuing command shutdown -h now in terminal and doing Shutdown from apple menu?\nUsing command it's instantly power down the system. But via menu it takes around 30-40 seconds. \nAlso is it safe to use command shutdown -h now all the time?\n\nA: From the shutdown man page:\n Upon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a\n SIGKILL.  The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally inde-\n terminate period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time\n to flush all dirty data and exit.  Developers are encouraged to file a\n bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this func-\n tionality.\n\nSo from what I understand, processes may be killed before they have properly cleaned up.\n\nFrom the launchctl man page:\n  reboot [system|userspace|halt|logout|apps|reroot <mount-point>]\n              Instructs launchd to begin tearing down userspace.

With the halt argument given, launchd will make the\n              reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely torn\n              down and pass the RB_HALT flag, halting the system and not ini-\n              tiating a reboot.\n\nThis is what I think shutting down via the menu does, it is better as it ensures that all userland processes are exited cleanly before halting/rebooting the system.\n\nI would be tempted to say that the launchctl method is better, and the shutdown -h now method could possibly result in some oddities should a process be killed before properly cleaning itself up.\n", "Q: How do I whitelist a domain in iOS restrictions web filter? Turning on iOS restrictions (Settings - General - Restrictions) and the web filter inside (probably \"Websites - Restrict adult content\" or something similar in English), I tried whitelisting wikipedia.org but the whitelist doesn't seem to work. For instance, the page \"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control\" is still blocked.\nI tried whitelisting *.wikipedia.org/*. It still doesn't work, and I can't find any instructions on how to format the entries.\nHow do I exclude a specific domain from being filtered?\nWith respect, please refrain from non-answers such as \"just turn off restrictions\" or suggesting unrealistic solutions like \"you have to enter every possible subdomain by hand without using wildcards\".\nIphone 5 running Ios 8.4\n\nA: According to Andreas, he recently tried it again and it works fine now. But here's a somehwhat comprehensive answer anyways:\nThere are two ways to whitelist a website:\n\n*\n\n*From Safari: When you try to access a website and it gets blocked, tap \"Allow Access\" and then the restrictions passcode.\n\n*From Settings: Go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Enter the passcode. Then go to the Safari settings. There, add your website to \"Always allow\" list. In your case, adding \"wikipedia.org\" would be enough.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no ways to add wildcards like \"*.google.*\", which is what I need and why I ended up here.\nNote: If the website you are trying to whitelist is in the Never Allow list, then remove first from that list. Otherwise whatever you do, that website will still get blocked since the Never Allow list trumps the Always Allow list.\nAbout Domains and Subdomains:\nDomains trump subdomains. In other words, if apple.com is on the blacklist, all subdomains, like developer.apple.com for example, will also be blocked.\nOn the other hand, if developer.apple.com is on the blacklist, but not apple.com, then only the former will be blocked and the latter would still be accessible.\nNote: If there are screen time limitations (app limits) in effect, you may also have to add the whitelisted domains and sub-domains to the specific screen time limit - go to 'websites' at the bottom of the list and tick the circles against the permitted domains.\n", "Q: What carriers can utilize my unlocked AT&T iPhone 5?

I have tried running it in safe mode but it didn't help .the problem is only with alphabets and numerals all other keys are working properly . Strangely p, z, x , c,v,b, n and m are also working\n\nA: Check your keyboard settings.\nGo to  System Preferences... > Keyboard then the Input Sources tab.\nDepending on your language, you should be able to see the current layout.\nKeyboards can be configured for different languages and different layouts.  The US Keyboard standard is commonly called QWERTY as many physical keyboards are laid out that way.  Notice the keys from Q to Y left to right.  If you see your preferred layout there and it is not currently selected, change it.\n\nUPDATE: Check that your keyboard may not have physical damage (liquid) by pugging in an external keyboard via USB or Bluetooth if you have one available.  If the external operates properly, there could be some physical damage.  If it operates the same as the built in keyboard, then the problem is in software.\n", "Q: Boot Failed.

I've not really noticed it anywhere else, but this is where I do most of my web-site typing.\nAs I start to type into a text field, all is well, but the longer I type, the slower the input gets, until eventually I can be  half a sentence in front of what's appearing on screen. [It's doing it now, as I type this question]\nFirst thoughts would be RAM/paging, CPU busy, overall computer speed - however, I have 64GB RAM, about 12GB in use, swap is 0 bytes; CPU is doing about 2% right now; machine is a Mac Pro 5,1 3.46GHz 12-core.\nI've tested using a completely clean admin account, in case of any legacy prefs/extension issues etc [as this is a migration from an older machine], with the same results, typing lag after just 2 or 3 lines of text.\nThis also used to happen on my old machine, Mac Pro 3,1 2.8GHz 8-core, so it's not machine-specific.\nI just discovered it doesn't appear to affect Chrome, so I'm suspecting Safari itself more than anything else.\nI've tried disabling all Edit > Spelling & Grammar and all Substitutions with no improvement.\nOS X 10.10.4 Safari 8.0.7 - though it's not been exclusive to those versions, it is getting worse over time.\nI'd appreciate any further troubleshooting ideas, or even just confirmation that anyone else may have seen this behaviour.\n\nA: I guess we should mark this one down as\n\"El Capitan & Safari 9 fixed it\"\nI no longer see anything like the 'lag' I was getting before & all behaves as it should.\n", "Q: Can I change my Podcast name without loosing my subscribers in iTunes? I have a Podcast. I herd that if I change the Title of it I might loose my subscribers. \nIs there a way to change my Podcast Title without loosing my subscribers in iTunes?\n\nA: Making a change to the title tag within your podcast's RSS feed will update the podcast title within iTunes, without losing subscribers. It may take a day or two for such a change take effect within iTunes.\n\nNote: The main concern is that making a title change to a podcast where the feed is created for you automatically could potentially change the url for the feed which will stop the podcast from updating [...and an 'easy fix' for that could be resubmitting your podcast, which would lose your subscribers!].\n\nSo http://example.com/oldTitle.rss might become http://example.com/newTitle.rss.\nIf needed, it's possible to update the feed URL within iTunes, without resubmitting your podcast or losing subscribers, as described by Apple in the 'Changing Your RSS Podcast Feed URL' section of their podcast specs:\n\nYou can move your podcast feed from one location to another. To avoid\n  losing subscribers, you must announce the change directly to all users\n  who are subscribed to your feed. To do so, you should:\n– Use the <itunes:new-feed-url> tag described in the iTunes RSS Tags\n  section below.\n– Set your web server to return an HTTP 301 redirect\n  response when receiving a request for the old feed.\nThis will update\n  the iTunes Store with the new feed URL and your subscribers will\n  continue to receive new episodes automatically. Be sure to maintain\n  the <itunes:new-feed-url> tag and the HTTP 301 redirect response for\n  at least 4 weeks to ensure that most subscribers have attempted to\n  download your most recent episode and have thereby received the new\n  URL.\n\n", "Q: start.command permission denied even after chmod I have been trying to run my server.command file forever.

I just received my first MacBook Pro as a birthday gift, and I am one of those people that tends to \"baby\" their electronics. I also tend to play World of Warcraft (WOW) quite a bit, but the problem is that is drains the battery very quickly. I have a 13 inch Retina Display. \n\nA: If your computer says it's charging but the battery level percentage is still going down, then you're putting way too much stress on it. It's a rare occasion, but I have seen it happen once or twice.\nIf your battery percentage goes up, no matter how slowly, you should still be okay to use it while charging.\nEDIT: Sorry, I don't know whether or not a charging-but-decreasing battery is actually bad for the hardware. I was just thinking that it's a situation that you should know could happen if you're doing a lot of battery-intensive processes. I don't know whether or not it damages your battery in the long run, just that it's possible that plugging your charger in won't actually charge the battery as quickly as you're draining it.\n", "Q: Why is my screen bowing out on my iPhone 5? Why is my screen popping out of my iPhone 5? And how can I fix it?\n\n\nUpdate: I fixed it! Here is what the old battery looked like:\n\n\nA: Nice issue, it happened to me just a couple of weeks ago.\nI solved it taking the iPhone back to the Apple Store (3 years old, not covered by warranty). They replaced my iPhone with a refurbished one in 10 minutes for free. I think this is the best solution.\nOtherwise you can try to fix it on your own. The issue here is that the battery is collapsing and expanding, pushing your screen away from the case.\nHere is a useful illustrated guide for DIY fix. Here is the replacement kit (part + tools).\n\nA: I think it should be mentioned that a bulging or swollen battery is a sign of failure and it may be  dangerous.\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAll Li-ion cells expand at high levels of state of charge (SOC) or over-charge, due to slight vaporisation of the electrolyte. (…) This is very noticeable for LiPos, which can visibly inflate due to lack of a hard case to contain their expansion.\nLiPo cells are affected by the same problems as other lithium-ion cells. This means that overcharge, over-discharge, over-temperature, short circuit, crush and nail penetration may all result in a catastrophic failure, including the pouch rupturing, the electrolyte leaking, and fire.\n\nI've found a question here on Ask Different referring to similar problems with MacBook batteries (which are basically the same) that explain the possible risks and another one with measures to dispose of a failing battery, after a long rant on Apple.\n\nA: Sorry, the digitizer is separating from the LCD. If you feel comfortable buy a new digitizer assembly (not the digitizer or LCD alone) and change it out with the iPhone 5 digitizer assembly guide from ifixit.com. Otherwise take it to someone who can change it fit you (be prepared to pay $75-$100+).\n", "Q: Turn off Macbook automatic hibernation mode? I'm having a problem with my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) where by when I lock my machine and then return several hours later (at least six hours) it will not respond to me pressing the keyboard.\nI have to press the power button and then it boots up requiring a password.  Once this password has been entered it takes a few minutes to slowly start all of my processes again (I hear skype logging in behind the blue screen) eventually my bluetooth mouse and keyboard are connected.  Finally I can then enter my password to actually gain access to my machine.\nThis is a problem I've had with OSX since Mavericks was released.\nBelow is a screenshot of the settings I have tried to change (everything possible) to stop this stupid behaviour and it still persists!\n\n\n\n\nA: From a Terminal, use the following command to disable hibernation:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nIf you later want to enable hibernation, use:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\nIf you want to free up the disk space used by hibernation, use the following command:\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: This file is automatically recreated as needed if hibernation is reenabled and it doesn't already exist.\n\n\nA: Updated answer for Mojave and Catalina. You can prevent hibernation mode via this command:\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nSource: https://www.howtogeek.com/260478/how-to-choose-when-your-mac-hibernates-or-enters-standby/\n\nYou can disable standby mode entirely, if you like.

For £80 I don't mind going up one notch to the 2.5Ghz i7, but unless I'm doing hardcore stuff i.e. graphics/movie editing, am I just throwing money at a wall? Also will time play an effect on the speed of this? i.e. 3-4 years down the line? Will there be a noticeable difference?\n\nA: If you can, your best option is to wait until October, when the new Macs come out, but if you can't, I'd go with the 2.5GHz.

It would not let me copy them on the hard drive for an unknown reason (red not permitted sign appearing when hovering the external hard drive icon). Then I decided to move all those folders to Macintosh HD by hovering the icon, it looks like everything went great until I started to look into the folders and discover that they were all empty, all folders within folders are still there but every single file vanished!\nWhat should I do ?\n\nA: Go into Disk Utility, select your hard drive, and then select repair on the right, then select repair disk permissions.\nKeep Calm and Repair Disk Permissions\n", "Q: In OS X, is it better to put apps in /Applications or in ~/Applications? I've noticed that pkg installers and obviously apps installed from the App Store) put apps in the /Applications file, yet Steam usually puts them in ~/Applications. Both work, and both are writable by the user, but are there circumstances under which one should be done over the other?\nI am the only user of this computer, and shared folders aside, I've disabled guest access.  \n(this is coming from a Linux user, so having a root folder be writable seems wrong, unless my permissions are wrong from the start)\n\nA: *\n\n*By default the root directory should not be directly writable, by other then root, without being prompt for permission with other users in Finder and or using sudo from the command line.\n\n\n*In my opinion /Applications should be used over ~/Applications for most applications as that is the default location.  Also I certainly do not want to bloat out my Home folder with applications.  I like keeping User Data separate from the OS and Applications, it just makes logical sense for many reasons.\n\nA: What no-one seems to have pointed out so far is that /Applications are usable by everybody and ~/Applications are only for that user.\nSome installers will ask if you want to install for this user or for everybody. That's how it can differentiate.\nThat will be one of the reasons Steam installs to there, as it's a per user license.\nApple's app licensing, though 'per ID' doesn't prevent all a machine's users from accessing apps purchased under another user account, so everything else usually goes in /Applications by default.\nOf course, if you're the machine's sole user, the distinction becomes moot.\n\nA: I believe it is a permissions issue. OSX is a multi user system, each user can have his own apps, files and folders. Here is what Apple says about Users: \nStandard user: Standard users are set up by an administrator. A standard user can install apps and change settings for his or her own use. Standard users can’t add other users or change other users’ settings.\nManaged user: Users who are managed with parental controls can access only the apps and content specified by the administrator managing the user. The administrator can restrict the user’s contacts and website access, and place time limits on computer use.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH18891?locale=en_US\nI think the ~/Applications will only be accessed by the particular User. If you have 3 users there will be /Applications, UserA/Applications, UserB/Applications, UserC/Applications. UserA will not have access to UserB/Applications or UserC/Applications. All 3 will have access to /Applications though.\n", "Q: Built in keyboard that supports all Mongolian characters While OS X supports a vast library of characters in its set of keyboards, Mongolian is missing.  I would like to know if Mac OS (Yosemite) has a keyboard with a character set sufficient to type all Mongolian characters.  If possible, I would prefer a keyboard that most resembles traditional Mongolian keyboards.  Installing keyboard apps or extensions would be a last resort.\n\nA: No, Apple has never provided a Mongolian keyboard layout with OS X (either cyrillic or traditional script).  You will have to use one of layouts which can be downloaded and installed from the internet.

My laptop is my work computer and it's and ASUS, and I can't install iTunes on any of the desktops here because it's not allowed. I desperately need my phone for work right now. I've tried resetting it, locking it, everything.\n\nA: All you can really do is see if you can use one of your friend's computers to use iTunes on it. There's absolutely nothing you can do to the iPhone to get rid of that Connect To iTunes screen, short of connecting it to iTunes.\n\nA: Same problem happened to iOS6, and iOS7 update, and try the steps in this article. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\nIf you don’t have iTunes, take your phone to a computer that does. You can get your settings entered and restore from iCloud backup (if you have one) once ios is restored. \n\nA: What worked for me after crawling around the internet was to install the latest version of iTunes then running it in Administrator mode. Meaning right clicking the iTunes program and click on \"Run as Administrator.\"\nWhat gave me the idea was after running a diagnostic test, it mentioned \"User is not an administrator.\" So I said, hmmm maybe this is what is causing this.

However I can still bear with it because with certain routers it works quite fine.\nThe OS X (Mavericks and Yosemite) on the other hand does not work at all with any router. Not even with the router at the Apple store. It simply doesn't connect. Even if it accidentally connects, it drops immediately after I try to load something.  I even tried to downgrade the driver and it didn't work either. It seems plausible to me that the problem lies in the driver itself, what can I do now?\nThe computer is a MacBook Air 11\" Mid 2012.\n\nA: The could be a couple of things going on, hardware or software. Let's eliminate software.\nGo to /Library/Preferences and look for the ones that start with \"com.apple.network\" I have three of them. Delete them and reboot.\nNow go back into your network preference pane. Any VPNs you set up will be gone and you should have the default list of all interfaces with network capability. Select the WiFi interface and configure that as you like.\nWhat I am thinking is possible that you have a damaged preference file associated with networking (hopefully I didn't miss any preference files...). Doing this will give you a clean slate with network settings. \nIf that doesn't do it, you may have a hardware issue, which means time for an Apple Genius appointment.\n", "Q: How can I set the default alert settings for calendar events added from Mail By hovering over a date or time in Mail, you can add a calendar event.

Since getting my mb-pro 3 years ago, I've only used it as a desktop. A few times, the battery has kicked-in for a few hours while the power was out. Someday, I might want to task it as a laptop. For the sake of the battery :  \n\nShould I be unplugging my mb from the wall just to use the battery?\n  For how long should I run on battery?\n  How often should I do this?\n\n\nA: Taken from https://web.archive.org/web/20110521104819/http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n\nStandard Maintenance\n  For proper maintenance of a lithium-based\n  battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving\n  occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged\n  in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her\n  notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This\n  keeps the battery juices flowing. If on the other hand, you use a\n  desktop computer at work, and save a notebook for infrequent travel,\n  Apple recommends charging and discharging its battery at least once\n  per month. Need a reminder? Add an event to your desktop’s iCal. When\n  your battery no longer holds sufficient charge to meet your needs, you\n  may choose to replace it. If your notebook came with a built-in\n  battery, you should have the battery replaced only by an Apple\n  Authorized Service Provider.\n\n", "Q: How to reedit annotations in Preview on Mac? After PDF was annotated, saved and PDF closed I want to reopen PDF but I can not anymore edit it, can not select annotations, arrows. Any workaround?\n\nA: In Preview, under the \"Tools\" menu, choose the \"Show Inspector\".\nIn the Inspector window that pops up, you'll see several tabs, including \"General Info\", and \"Keywords\", and all the way to the right to the last tab is \"Annotations\".\nClick that tab, and you'll have a list of the annotations you've made. Choose one and you'll see, you have refreshed editing capabilities.\n\n\nA: I am not really sure, but if you could at least open the file with Preview app, there might be an option to revert to previous version from the File menu. \n\nA: Once you save an image in Preview the changes you have made become part of the image - i.e. they can no longer be edited. However, Preview does store all previous saved versions of a file. To restore an image to a previously saved state (i.e. undo recent changes) choose File > Revert To > Browse All Versions. You can then scroll through all previous versions of the image file & choose one to restore. Best analogy of this functionality is the way Time Machine works. \n\nA: Annotate your images in Notes instead. Same set of tools as in Preview, but you can re-edit annotations to your heart's content.\n\nA: I have found annotations in Preview to be unpredictable. You could try opening the PDF in Adobe Acrobat if you have it—you'll probably find that each of Preview's fancy looking annotations are also there as an editable comment.\n", "Q: Why can I not backup my replacement iPhone after restoring an iCloud backup? I replaced my iPhone 6 with an identical phone, restored the most recent backup from iCloud.  I now cannot backup to the cloud without adding more storage.  Why?\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage (iCloud) and delete the backup for your old phone.   The new phone will overwrite it own backups, just like the old phone did.  It won't overwrite the backup for another device (I.e your old phone).\n", "Q: How to fine tune force touch trackpad sensitivity? The force touch trackpad seems great but I would like to reduce it's sensitivity.\nIt seems the UI allow selection of 3 modes:\nClick: Light - Medium - Firm \nwhich both set sensitivity and the haptic feedback level.\nWould it be possible to set the sensitivity in a more fine way ? Maybe by command line ?\n\nA: Well, BetterTouchTool seems to be able to modify the trackpad sensibility for 2 fingers and more clicks. It can as well change the haptic feedback strength and feeling (you can have your trackpad vibrate when you force click with two fingers). However, it's not able to change the force click with one finger but it proves that we can have a low driver access to the new macbook force touch trackpad. If somebody got any documentation on how to access these drivers, I could try to play around with that and maybe develop a little app to change the sensitivity of the pad. \n", "Q: Recover FIles/Folder from sudo rm -rf Terminal Command Short Story:\nI was attempting to create a symlinked folder from my external to my desktop, and the folder I wanted (ALL of my working folders and files) are gone.\nLong Story:\nMy job wanted me to use Box Sync for my files. I installed Box Sync, and told it to use my work external HDD as the sync. It created a folder on there called \"Box Sync\".\nOn that same HDD, I had a folder on there called \"Work Files\". I opened up Work Files in another window, and dragged and dropped everything from there into the new Box Sync folder.\nBox Sync started scanning so it could sync. There were a LOT of files and folders in there, so it didn't start syncing right away. While it was scanning, I decided to create a SymLink of the folder onto my desktop. I can never remember the terminal code, so I used the instructions in THIS ARTICLE.\nIn the article, they say to do:\nsudo rm -rf /PATH/TO/COPY\n\nand then\nln -s /PATH/TO/PASTE/\n\nHowerver, directly after using the first line, my \"Box Sync\" folder was deleted off of my external.\nHow on earth can I undo this damage?\n\nA: The command you ran first deletes all files and folders in /PATH/TO/COPY; note the warning above the command in the article you linked to: \"Next, remove the existing Downloads folder (make sure it is empty first).\"\nThough the data is probably still present on the drive, the operating system now has no idea where it is.\nAssuming that you don't have backups available, your only option at this point is probably to use some kind of file recovery software.

I have an iPhone 3GS that I want to restore to latest supported iOS (currently it's jailbroken on some version of iOS 4.0.1).\nHow would I go about it, without loosing all data? Can I run a restore from iTunes? Latest version of iTunes (12.2.1) doesn't even recognize that I have a device plugged in.\nEdit:\nI don't want to restore another jailbreak version. I want to restore a \"proper\" iOS\n\nA: Firstly, I would suggest you to check and find a version of iTunes that supports your iPhone 3GS. \nSecondly, you could backup your iPhone, but be aware that a backup could bring the issue back after the phone is freshly restored. \nNext, I can suggest to check and find a pre-activation method(as far as I remember RedSn0w was able to do that) and create a pre-activated IPSW file for yourself. \nAlso have on mind the specificity of the Firmware's BaseBand version of the iPhone, of you will need to unlock (after jailbreak) your phone.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS (jailbreak) not recognized in iTunes I have iPhone 3GS jailbroken running some version of iOS4.\nWith the latest iTunes version 12.2.1 (and the previous one I had installed), the device is not recognized as plugged in.

Windows sees the device, but iTunes does not.\nEdit 2:\n- Tried different cable\n- Tried on a different PC\n- Tried on a different Mac  \n\nA: The latest iTunes does not support as much older versions of iOS as iOS4 is. \nI recommend you to uninstall your current iTunes, clear cache ... etc., reboot your computer and then download and install an older version of iTunes. \nOnce you are done with the above steps, I can recommend you to make sure that the USB port on your computer works well and to check the USB cable of the phone as well.

But nearly 120GB of missing space? That's completely unreasonable. (And half my hard drive.)\nWhere do I go next?\n\nA: Take a look at Time Machine, it may be keeping local snapshots.\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nBecause Time Machine removes local snapshots as needed, Finder and Get Info windows don't include them in their calculations. To see how much storage space local snapshots are using, choose About This Mac from the Apple menu, then click Storage. The space used by local snapshots is labeled Backups.\n\nYou can disable them, but they get automatically deleted if you need space:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If less than 20% of the total storage space on your startup drive is available, Time Machine removes local snapshots, starting with the oldest, until you have more than 20% free space.\n  \n*If less than 10% or less than 5GB of storage space is available, Time Machine removes local snapshots more quickly. When only one snapshot remains, Time Machine stops creating new snapshots. As free space increases, Time Machine at first replaces the previous snapshot with a new one, then eventually resumes creating snapshots as normal.\n  \n\n\nA: It was the Time Machine local backups. After running:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\nI have my space back! The /Volumes/MobileBackups/ folder was enormous.\nI never use Time Machine aside from restoring from a catastrophic failure, and I don't know if I've ever touched the Time Machine GUI - so the local backups were completely unnecessary for me.\n\nA: I can suggest you to try Disk Inventory X (http://www.derlien.com) \nIt has a visual preview for the size of each file and different colors for groups of files/etc.\n", "Q: Parrallels 10 and Windows 10 keyboard typing incorrect characters When I type a double quotes on Parallels 10 with Windows 10 I see the following character.\nDoes anybody have any idea how to fix this?\n\n\nA: Somehow Windows 10 set my language input to \"English - United Kingdom\" instead of \"English - United States\".\nBy removing everything besides \"English - United States\" under \"Languages\" in Control Panel it fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Can I erase a missing device to iCloud after removing it from My Devices? I had to return a dead iPhone to my phone carrier, so I needed to 1) erase the phone, and 2) remove it from the Find My iPhone app on my iCloud account. The phone is still in my possession for a day or two, but I cannot get it to charge and the battery has no juice. \nSince the phone won't turn on, I needed to perform those two steps on iCloud.com rather than on my phone. \nUnfortunately, I accidentally Removed the phone before Erasing it. :-( \nAs a result, I no longer can see it in my list of devices in the Find My iPhone app on iCloud.com. However, in the Settings app, it lists that phone as one of my iDevices running either iOS 8, Yosemite, or WatchOS. \nIs there any way I can still schedule an erase for the iPhone if/when it comes alive? \n\nA: I'm afraid since the device is removed from Find my iPhone app you can no longer make changes from iCloud.com. If you would be able to start the device again - sometimes you don't even need to go all the way as fully booted system - it will reappear in the Find my iPhone app.\nI work at a retail chain as a service agent and have seen this many times. Customers wanting to leave their phone for repair/replacement, have removed the unit from iCloud.com but not erased it - simply starting it will reactivate the Find my iPhone and remote erase is available again.\nHope you get any way to start the device - even if it's not a fully booted system.\n", "Q: iPad Factory Reset Without iTunes I have a 4th gen iPad that I haven't used for so long that I forgot the PIN.  I  want to restore it to factory defaults as I plan to use it again.  Everything I'm finding on this topic suggests that I need to use iTunes on a computer to accomplish this.  Is this actually the case?  Can't I use some combination of powering off/powering on and physical buttons to accomplish the same thing?\n\nA: No amount of button pushing reloads the OS. \nYou can try to brute force the pin, you can try to log in if you already have jail broken the device, the only option to bypass the pin is to connect to USB and have iTunes or a similar sophisticated program speak with the firmware. \nOnce you've loaded things with iTunes (or substitute) then you have to deal with activation lock if you have that enabled. \n\nA: Try to put the device in DFU mode and then you will be able to restore it. \nNote: If the device is locked via iCloud account, you may be receiving errors while restoring and/or you may need to unlock the device first. \nHow to put the device into DFU mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*While the device is powered ON, hold down the POWER+HOME BUTTONS until the device shuts down, keep holding down the HOME button and plug the USB cable into the device. \n\n*Open iTunes and it should find a device in Recovery mode.\n\n\nA: There is only one way to force your iPad to reset if you do not know the passcode and do not have access to a computer.  If you put in the wrong passcode 10 consecutive times, the iPad will automatically erase all data and then reset itself.  This is only if this feature has already been set up in your general settings.  It will take some time, because the more times you put in the wrong passcode, the longer the ipad will lock until you can try it again (1 minute, then 5, then 30, then an hour, then 24 hours for the tenth and final time).  then, you do not need a computer or iTunes to set up you iPad...it will be like it is brand new.\n", "Q: FaceTime application not available I bought my iPhone 6 Plus in Georgia. I am using the phone in Georgia. FaceTime is not available on my iPhone.

However, it is impossible to tell for sure. What I usually do, is to clone my system to either a second partition in the internal drive or to an external (USB) drive (using a tool like SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner).\nAfter booting the clone (press alt in the boot screen) you can safely upgrade this partition to a newer version of OS X and play with it for a while.

The laptop came back from servicing with a new (refurbished as I understand) logic board. But while running a benchmarking test (Unigine Valley) the on screen graphics are extremely pixelated.\nThe service center suggested it was due to a faulty RAM. So I purchased new identical RAM. Same issue. After months of struggling with AppleCare and Apple Exec relations, they first asked me to get a clean install of the latest OS. Once that was done, the feedback from their engineering team is now that it \"could be\" due to the defunct trackpad (condition since before the repair, and I use a USB or bluetooth replacement, instead of replacing it out of warranty). \nIs it at all possible that the screen graphics are pixelated because of a defunct trackpad? \nI fear I am being scammed by Apple to pay for a pointless hardware repair...\nThe trackpad is actually not connected - the cable connecting it to the logic board is gone, so it is just out of service / disconnected. I am running stock OS and it works fine. The benchmarking tool works fine on other MacBook Pros. The trackpad has been out of service since before the repair, and this problem with the benchmarking test is after the repair. So I believe it is unrelated.\n\nA: It's very common for one component it's connected electrically to another component to cause noise and other issues. Whether it's the most likely cause is debatable, but Apple's service centers have direct access to engineering and a huge wealth of repair data so they would be my first authority to go to determine what is likely and what is not.\nWithout the detailed diagnostics from your specific repairs as well as the actual service manuals it's hard to second-guess Apple.\nApple provides a nice (IMO) warranty of 90 days and any repair, so it's hard to see how they would be scamming you.  If you set down and catalog each interaction with AppleCare, have you spoken with them 10 or 20 times? \nAlso you need to collect all of the written estimates and repair details to know what components have and have not been examined by a technician. \nThe only time I've known Apple executive relations to be unable to resolve A customer issue is when Apple has already bent over backwards to accommodate their responsibilities and person requesting the repair is the one being unreasonable.  I certainly wouldn't accuse you of that with the little data presented, but if you really still unsure collect the facts and data you have and give it to someone who is somewhat impartial and have them give you their opinion.\nAlso, a final note - unless you are running stock OS or an apple benchmark, I've seen all sorts of gfx card mods and graphics tools cause exactly what you see. My guess is Apple knows other parts to be good and is guessing the trackpad is the most likely of the ones that remain in tested. \nI would ask them the cost of a depot repair, and you'll have to be Ok with paying for it if they replace parts - even if the benchmark fails to run. If your Mac boots the normal OS fine, I would not pursue further repairs till the situation deteriorates. \n", "Q: Can I get my pictures back? Okay so I recently jail broke my phone and well my phone broke it doesn't work no more like at all, it doesn't even turn on. And well the only way to fix it is to unjailbreak it and to do that I need to restore it I tried doing that with iTunes and it does let me but what it does not let me do is back up my device and if I restore it everything is going to erase. Is there a way to get everything back specially my pictures after I restore my phone? \n\nA: If the device isn't backed up previously, short answer: No.\nI haven't used any data recovery apps for iPhones before, but a quick google will help you find a few commercial apps that might help you. But the chance that it will succeed after erasing and installing a new working OS will be limited.\n\nA: Have you tried connecting your device to your computer and viewing the files through a program like iexplorer? You might be able to access your photos this way? If your phone isn't turning on however this could still not work. \n", "Q: Background processes periodically eat up my CPU time on OS X 10.10.4, Yosemite Periodically the CPU on my iMac Mid-2015 running OS X 10.10.4, gets used almost exclusively by:\n\n\n*\n\n*launchd: ~70%\n\n*fseventsd: 12%\n\n*UserEventAgent: ~40%\n\n*opendirectoryd: 20%\n\n*notifyd: 12%\n\n\nI have tried quitting programs (e.g. Chrome, Outlook etc.) and no apparent process seems to be the culprit.  It seems to occur once an hour (at least it has done it 3 times in the last 3 hours) and each episode lasts ~10-30minutes.  It does not appear to be reproducible with any action that I take.\nIf I open Console.app, in system.log, there are many repeated errors, such as:\nAug  6 16:29:11 DREWGEHRYW13 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.google.keystone.user.agent[60455]): Service setup event to handle failure and will not launch until it fires.`\n\nThese errors are not generated the entire time when this behavior is occurring, but it seems that they are written every few minutes (even when Chrome is closed).\nIn System Log Queries -> All Messages : There aren't any recent messages\nAlso, possibly related, I have experienced 2 kernel panics in the past week caused by launchd (or processes launched by it), but I will limit this question to solely the CPU issue for now.\nWhat is causing this and how do I fix this?\n\nA: Today, I checked Chrome and it states that \nVersion 43.0.2357.65(64-bit)\nUpdate failed (error: 12)\n\nIt appears that my version is out of date by about 3 weeks.  So I believe that Chrome was periodically trying to frantically update and would subsequently fail.  I followed the recommendations of Google and attempted removing the appropriate files, but my version of Chrome would still not update.  \nI ended up uninstalling Chrome by dragging the icon from Applications to the trash and removing ~/Library/Google and /Library/Google (not sure why it is here also...).  I reinstalled Chrome and it appears that I now have the most up to date version of Chrome (44.0.2403.103) and I have yet to experience any of those errors or cooking of my cpu.  I have been at my desktop now for 4 hours, so hopefully this issue has been resolved.  I'll also see if I experience anymore kernel panics, hopefully these issues were related and both are resolved.\n\nA: This is not a complete answer, but may be a partial solution.\nI've been seeing high CPU and memory usage from UserEventAgent, and the only fix that I found after much searching was to disable Notification Center. It's quite possible that only part of Notification Center is the problem, or one particular app's notifications, but I haven't had the time to troubleshoot that yet.\nTo disable Notification Center, do these two commands in Terminal:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\n", "Q: How does iOS and OS X detect when a Wi-Fi network is a personal hotspot? When there is a Personal Hotspot network available, it displays a chain link icon instead of the usual lock icon in the list of available networks on iOS and OS X.\n\nMy question is, how does OS X distinguish these networks? Is it specified in 802.11 how hotspots broadcast their SSID's differently?\n\nA: I think this question should be posted in Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange site. You're asking for the implementation details about a black box...\nIn fact I did dig around a little on /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/AirPort.menu and /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreWLAN.framework/\nThere is a private method of CWNetwork called isPersonalHotspot, kind of:\nchar -[CWNetwork(Private) isPersonalHotspot](void * self, void * _cmd) {\n    eax = [*(self + 0x4) objectForKey:@\"IOS_IE\"];\n    eax = LOBYTE(eax != 0x0 ? 0x1 : 0x0) & 0xff;\n    return eax;\n}\n\nIt seems just checking some identifiers. I think SFRemoteHotspotDevice and WiFiXPCEventProtocol may have more low level details but I didn't check.\nBTW, There is also a property to identify whether is CarPlay network\n@interface CWNetwork : NSObject <NSCopying, NSSecureCoding>\n... //redacted\n@property(readonly) BOOL isPersonalHotspot;\n@property(readonly) BOOL isCarPlayNetwork;\n... //redacted\n\nApple controls the Hardware, the Drivers and the Operating System, I guess they can easily add extra metadata when broadcasting the WiFi signal so your Mac knows to whether adding the chain icon or not.\nIf anyone figure out exactly how Apple did the trick, please let me know. :)\n\nA: Apple talks to Apple, they know their own products and know when it is an Apple device or not. Apple may have their own MAC Address range or they simply see all the information there is about this device, ie:\nIf you go to About this Mac, System Report, Network, Wifi. You will see the following details about this network/device.\n\nCheck at interfaces: Card Type, MAC Address or Locale. These can possibly be all \"Apple Identifiers\". When making a hotspot with your iPhone, Apple decided to share the info with your Mac to show it's an Apple device.\n\nA: The chain icon is showing that the internet connection is being bridged through another device. It is not specifically for personal hotspots.\n\nA: Also, hotpots on iOS are identified as 172.20.10.x, as well.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Display Issue I own a 11 month old MacBook Pro 13\" with Apple Care. From the last 2 months, I've noticed a bright line on my screen which is about 0.5 cm in size. Should I be worried? Will Apple be able to repair it?\n\nA: I would say you should not be worried however since you do have Apple Care I'd backup your files using Time Machine and then make arrangements to have it looked at and repaired.  As to whether or not they can fix it or just replace the part(s) in question that will be decide by Apple however since it's under warranty the'll have to fix it or replace it.\nFrom Contact Apple Support ...\n\nA Genius Bar reservation is an easy way to get hardware repairs, but\n  we can solve many issues over the phone or by chat.

My iPhone 5s will not sync anymore. iTunes reads it once it's plugged in and comes back with an error message saying \"You do not have enough access privileges for this operation.\".\n\nA: I have only seen this with beta versions of the OS and/or iOS. \nThe first step is going to be to reproduce the problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect everything power off the iPhone \n\n*Save your work on the Mac and shut it down as well \n\n*Power on the iPhone and then put it in airplane mode \n\n*Start the Mac and fire up iTunes (only iTunes if possible )\n\n\nThen keep good notes on what you see - all dialogs and exact text, what operation causes the issue and the times. From there, you can look over access logs and iTunes logs on the Mac and/or get support involved to read the legs from the iOS device if needed. \nFeel free to comment or ask a follow on question once you have it pinned down. For me, the restarts fixed the issue or it was a server side issue and not reproducible past the time Apple's servers were busy or slow. \n", "Q: How much space does Apple music offline songs take up? I have a Macbook Pro with 120 GB storage. As i have limited space i was wondering where the offline songs on Apple music are stored? How much space do they take?\n\nA: Apple Music offline songs are stored in this directory:\n/Users/[your-user]/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Apple Music\n\nA normal Song with a duration between 3:45 min and 5:02 min is about 7MB to 11MB large. rule of thumb is to calculate 10MB per Song and you are on the safe side. \nFor Example a Maroon 5 song:\n12 This Summer.m4p\n(8,5 MB on disk)\n/Users/bMalum/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Apple Music/Maroon 5/V (Deluxe)\nDuration: 03:44\n\n", "Q: How to stop TextWrangler changing the text file icon? I use a several text editors, but every time I save with TextWrangler it changes the file's icon in Finder to a TextWrangler icon with the following extended attributes;\n\ncom.apple.FinderInfo\n  com.apple.TextEncoding\n\nHow do I get TextWrangler to stop doing this? I can't find a settings that seems to fix this.\n\nA: A support request was filed and Bare Bones responded quickly.\nTextWrangler sets the file type (com.apple.FinderInfo; file icon) when it determines that the file name cannot be used to determine that it is a text file. The exact determination here is not too important; as I found, hence I would assume that source code files would fall into this category. The text encoding is a standard attribute and is set to indicate the file's character encoding.\nTo disable the writing of these extended file attributes, the following command is used;\ndefaults write com.barebones.textwrangler WriteExtendedAttributes -string \"Never\"\n\nThe command itself is documented in the TextWrangler help files; but not how it relates to the character encoding and file associations.\nTo find and clear the attributes of the modified file(s), you can use the following standard commands;\nls -@l # list the files with extended attributes\nxattr -c filename.sh # where the file name and extension is as required\n\n\nA: I assume this is because TextWrangler sets the \"Always Open With\" option in your case. I can suggest you to take a look for an option to stop this or to try manually make a file to Always Open With TextEdit (for example) just to test if this is the issue.\n", "Q: Problems with photo stream I have a large photo library and I do not want to buy extra space from Apple so that I can use the iCloud photo library. Instead, I want to use the photo stream to synchronize every photo taken from my iPad and iPhone to my Mac (because here I have the space). And occasionally, I want to send some photos to my iPad/iPhone from my Mac.\nSo my problems with the photo stream are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens when a photo is added to the photo stream? In the OS X photos App, it will be downloaded and permanently saved in the library, even if it is deleted from the photo stream. In iOS however, it will be downloaded but when removed from the photo stream it will disappear from my iOS device as well. Can I somehow save it there permanently like under OS X?\n\n*Some photos are not downloaded to my Mac although they are listed under the photo stream album on my iPhone, with which I took them. They are not listed in the photo stream album under the Photos App in OS X. What could be the problem?\nAny hints appreciated.\n\nA: I'll try to answer your inquiries based on my experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*In iOS, to be able to save an image from the Photo Stream (PS), you need to tap an image and select the Save Image action to make a copy of that image to the Camera Roll.\n\n*That may be a bug in iOS/OS X, I'm not sure, but that also happens to me especially with the most recent photos I took. But sometimes, after a couple of minutes, the Photos app on my Macbook Air will be updated. You can connect your iPhone to your Mac and just import those images that you can't see in your Photos app.\n", "Q: Multiple languages and Emoji button on iOS keyboard I'm using German and English keyboard on my iPhone and want to insert emojis easily. The problem is when you have 2 languages and emoji, it only jumps to the next keyboard. This is very annoying.\nIs there a possibility to have a language button (German/English/…) and a emoji button?\n\n\nA: No, this is not possible.\nYou can quickly switch to a specific keyboard by holding down on the keyboard language button and sliding your finger to the specific keyboard.\nAlso, the keyboard order is always fixed, so you know to double-tap the keyboard language button to go to a specific keyboard from another specific keyboard.\n\nA: Using Gboard, you can avoid having three keyboards and have access to Emoji as you can see in the image below but I stopped using it for two reasons:\n\n*\n\n*Using the speech-to-text feature is not smooth. It switches apps whenever you click the mic button to transcribe your voice.\n\n*Gboard is not accessible on a lock screen. It's usually not a problem but can be a hassle in some situations.\n\n\n\nA: Yes it is possible.

There are multiple administrator accounts in my Mac. I don't want an administrator to snoop into another administrator's account. Is there any way I can prevent an administrator from resetting the password of another administrator account?\n\nA: The simple answer is no.\nBest practices on multi-user Macs dictate Standard accounts for all users, with a separate administrator account setup for maintenance work (software installs and/or updates, etc.) The philosophy is that with great power comes great responsibility, and an innocent mistake can cause havoc.\nDaily use of Macs (and PCs for that matter) do not require the elevated privileges granted to a administrator account. At home, for example, I've created two admin accounts: one for emergencies, and my own account. Three other accounts: for my spouse and 2 kids, are Standard. When my kids are old enough to have their own Macs, they'll have only standard accounts, too, with a separate admin account for maintenance & whatnot. When they make enough money to purchase their own Mac, then they can decide how secure to make them.\n", "Q: Excel Mac - Some txt files can't be opened/imported (\"Grayed out\") A bit of an odd one.\nI'm using Excel for crunching some data I have in several .txt files.\nWhen I'm trying to import them via Data > Get External Data > Import Text File:\n\nLike as I've done many times in the past, I get the \"Choose a File\" Dialog Box, but when I browse to the folder, only a couple of the files are \"selectable\"; the others are \"Grayed out\":\n\nThere are no differences between the files that I can see that would justify the difference. The only \"logic\" is that the \"source\" file (let's call it 20150728 - SOURCE.TXT) comes via email from a Windows machine, and the two other locked files (20150728 - Source Fragment 3.TXT and 20150728 - Source Fragment 3 copy.TXT) are a copy of the Source where I've deleted some lines, and a second copy of the resulting file, while the non-locked ones started out as the Source where I deleted lines, and then did a \"Save As\" in TextWrangler...\nI can work around the issue just by copying the contents of the \"grayed\" files into a new document in TextWrangler and saving it, but I'd like to understand the reason for this behavior.\nDoing a file in the files in question shows them to be similar if not the same:\nMac:samples jjarava$ file 201507*txt\n20150728 - Source Fragment 3.TXT:      ASCII text\n20150728 - Source Framgent 1.TXT:      ASCII text\n20150728 - Source Fragment 1.TXT:      ASCII text\n20150728 - Source.TXT:                 ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\n20150728 - Source Fragment 3 copy.TXT: ASCII text\n\nI'm a bit \"stuck\" on what the issue might be. I have the feeling it's one of those \"Obscure Mac Quirks\" that are very hard to explain.\nEDIT: As per the comments below from @user3439894 and others, I've looked into the extended attributes of the files to see if that yields any hint.\nThe output of ls -l@for the files gives us:\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 jjarava  staff   7652 Aug  3 13:58 20150728 - Source Fragment 3 (BAD).TXT\n    com.apple.FinderInfo       32 \n    com.apple.TextEncoding     15 \n    com.dropbox.attributes     83 \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 jjarava  staff   6570 Aug  3 13:58 20150728 - Source Fragment 1 (Good).TXT\n    com.apple.FinderInfo       32 \n    com.apple.TextEncoding     15 \n    com.dropbox.attributes     83 \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 jjarava  staff   6616 Aug  3 13:58 20150728 - Source Fragment 2 (Good).TXT\n    com.apple.FinderInfo       32 \n    com.apple.TextEncoding     15 \n    com.dropbox.attributes     83 \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 jjarava  staff  21138 Aug  3 13:58 20150728 - Source (BAD).TXT\n    com.apple.FinderInfo       32 \n    com.dropbox.attributes     83 \n\nAgain, I see that one of the bad files (Source) is apparently missing the com.apple.TextEncoding attribute -- but the other \"not working\" file does have the attribute...

I already have Mini-DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI cable, is there any TV tuner available that supports it? \n\nA: I've never heard of a DisplayPort-based external TV tuner.\nBut there are HDMI-based TV tuners available, and HDMI-DVI adapters are cheap.\nSingle-link DVI supports 1920x1200 at 60 Hz, which is higher than any digital broadcast TV standard, so that wouldn't be your limiting factor.\n", "Q: Connecting monitor to mac via USB docking I just bought a new BenQ GL2450 monitor to connect to my macbook pro 13\" late 2011. I try to connect it with a DVI cable and via a USB docking that goes into my laptop, but the screen says no signal and my laptop does not recognise any monitor. The USB docking works perfectly fine with my keyboard, mouse and even my M-Audio Fastrack Ultra 8R USB interface. So could it be that the signal simply won't go through a USB cable and that I need to find an adapter and plug it directly into my mini displayport or something? Because it would be way much more simple to just connect one USB cable and have everything connected already.\nThank you!\n\nA: What is the docking station?  Without knowing, as a guess, I'd say yes, you will have to get video via the mini-DP.  USB and Firewire and such are not really designed to carry video signals, and while some USB docks do video, the laptop needs to support this properly - something that my MBP does not do at all.\nI get the convenience, but the mini-DP is the way to go.\n\nA: I agree that you cannot connect the monitor through the USB port.

Texts from me show up in a different thread, but when I click on the \"contact\" from his it takes it to my contact.  I do not use Apple any more (my son does), but he does use the Apple ID I set up when I had my old iPod.  The only thing I can think is that is what's causing the problem, but I can't figure out how to resolve it.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Open settings, tap iMessage, then go to send and receive. From here, you may edit which messages are sent and received by her. See below for screenshots of the process. \n\n\n\n\nBest of luck. \n\nA: On your mother's phone, delete your Apple ID (it's linked to the email – that's the info you need to remove) from your contact info (the page you are brought to when you click the contact). Add this same piece of info to your son's contact card. \nYour son should have his own Apple ID, but if you're not using it anymore I don't think it's necessary for him to create his own. He can change the email address to his own at appleid.apple.com\nAlternatively, he could just make a new Apple ID, and you can keep your old one in case you ever get another Apple device. This is honestly probably the easiest solution, unless there is some reason you want him to use the other account.\n\nA: This was occurring on my iPhone 7 except that it was with non-family members or people outside my same Apple ID or phone plan. It started after a restore from a backup. \nI was able to fix it by going into Contacts and clicking \"Import SIM Contacts\". Then import to iCloud. This lined my contacts, and conversations back up to the correct sender.\n", "Q: Photoshop not recognised as default app after OS update I just upgraded my system software and all my graphic design photo images now say I can't open them and I should click get info on the finder, which I do and they still won't open.\nThese are photoshop files that I have worked on in the past.\nOS X Yosemite, iMac\n\nA: Go to the file in Finder. Right click, and select 'Get Info'. This will open up a new window with all the file information. There are different sections in this window. Scroll down (or collapse the sections) until you get to the one titled 'Open with'.\nThere should be a drop down select menu that shows which program will be used to open the file. The default program will say \"(default)\" after the program name. Use this menu to select Photoshop. If it's not one of the options in this list, click 'other' to select it manually. If these are Photoshop files, OS X should recognize that Photoshop can open them, but if it is greyed out, select \"All Applications\" from the \"Enable:\" drop down menu.\nBack in the file info window, below the program select drop down, it says \"Use this application to open all files like this one.\" Click the button that says \"Change All\" (directly beneath this text) to make the selected program the default.\nIf any part of this doesn't work, my guess would be there is an issue with the Photoshop installation. Check that you can still use the application with other files. Reinstall the application and try this again.\n", "Q: Sort Apple Mail by \"replied to\" I'd like to sort my email on whether I've replied to it or not. Apple Mail puts a little replied to icon to the left of whatever emails I've replied to so I know this filter exists. \nThoughts on whether this is possible?\n\nA: Although Sorting by reply status is not possible, you can certainly Filter by reply status.\nUsing Smart Folders you can collect all replied to messages in one 'folder' and unreplied to in another.  These folders just gather the messages, they do not move them from their original folders unless you delete them.  But this can help you keep mail sorted.\nThen you can sort by date or other desired criteria.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: AppleTV 3rd Gen Displaying 'static' randomly We have a third generation AppleTV that has just started giving us trouble (after moving - although the unit was properly packed and transported, so I do not expect damage from this). \nRandomly when using various apps, the device will show what I would reference as static. The entire screen does this. The audio usually continues fine. Sometimes it gets so bad, that the TV will act like the input was dropped as well. \nConnections seem ok. Rebooting the unit (unplugging power) seems to stop it for a while. It may be using a new/different HDMI cable, but I have not swapped that out to see if it makes a difference. I did reseat all cables though. \nWhat would cause the device to do this? Is there anything I can do to fix it?\n\nA: Generally speaking, static on the HDMI link can be as a result of too much noise (the signal to noise reason is to low). You say you have not changed the cable, that would be my first suspect.\nChange that up and take it from there. Any breaks or wear on the cable and pins can introduce noise such that the signal effectively drops out. \n", "Q: Saving OS X Spaces/Desktops For how I use my laptop, it would be extremely helpful to be able to use Spaces/Desktops in OS X to break up different projects. One project may have a couple of websites/URLs, a pdf and a spreadsheet. It would be very useful to be able to put these in a space, eg have a browser window with tabs for each site that's related the project, the local files, and anything else that's related (maybe an email, document, etc.), close the Space and then open it later as needed.\nIs there a way to save Spaces/Desktops like this so that all files, browser tabs, etc. can be reopened at once by \"opening\" the Space/Desktop?\nI am running Mavericks.\n\nA: I use Yosemite but here can be found how to utilize in Mavericks:http://www.t-gaap.com/2013/10/29/managing-spaces-in-os-x-mavericksenter link description here\nIn Preferences check the Automatically Add box\n\nAdd several, I have 9 spaces I switch between in Yosemite:\n\nYou add a space by moving your cursor to the top right hot corner of your desktop and clicking the + sign.\n\nA: The quick answer is no. \nYou can assign an app to a space, but not a 'project', as such.\nRe-opening any app would at best reopen your last working session on that app. \nClosest you could get would be to keep all documents for that project in a single folder & select all, right-click/Open. Each would open to its last-assigned Space, last-assigned window placement.\nThis wouldn't work for email etc, though.\n\nA: There's no built-in way to do it, but there are a few third-party applications around that may get you at least some of the way there, such as Moom and Optimal Layout.\n", "Q: Does using an app send my IP address and device identification info to the app maker? if I use an app, would I be giving info like my IP address and device identification like the MAC address to the app developer/owner?\n\nA: This completely depends on the app. There's nothing that by default sends identifying in formation about your system to the App developers, the App would have to have been written in order to have this behavior. Depending on the app, however, it's possible that some might.\nYou didn't mention if you're on iOS or Mac OS. If you're on Mac OS, and you're concerned, or curious, you should consider installing an outgoing firewall like Little Snitch. What this will do is show an alert message asking for permission every time any app tries to send data to the Internet. You can use the Little Snitch network monitor to identify what data is being sent, to determine if your privacy is being violated. You can also prevent the app from sending data at all.\nIf you wanted to do the same for iOS you could use software on your router, but this is an advanced topic and beyond the scope of this answer.\n", "Q: Browsing another disk in Time Machine just lets me browse my actual hard drive I'm clicking \"Browse other backup disks...\" in the Time Machine menu, then selecting a Time Machine disk. This puts me into the Time Machine interface, but I just see my home folder. Not my home folder from my old computer, but my current home folder. How can I browse my old backups to retrieve files?\n\nA: To retrieve files from a Time Machine disk without using the Time Machine interface, open a new Finder window and open the volume from the sidebar. You should see a folder called Backups.db. Open this and the folder it contains for your computer.\nNote: If you're using a Network Disk, such as a Time Capsule or Airport Extreme with a connected disk, you will not see Backups.db, you will instead see a .sparsebundle file. Open this and you should be able to continue these instructions.\nYou will now see a list of folders, named by their date/time. Open the folder you wish to retrieve the file from and navigate to the appropriate location.\n", "Q: Can I safely backup my system by simply tarring things? Of course, the recommended method of backing up an OSX machine is to use Time Machine. But let's say that, for whatever reason, I'm deadset on doing it myself.\nIf I simply tar up things I care about (my user directory, /Applications, Application Support, Libraries etc), and later extract them to a fresh OSX install, will everything work? I know I have to use explicit flags to preserve ownership and permissions, but assuming I do that, does tar completely preserve all the metadata OSX wants like resource forks and all the rest of it?\n\nA: Time Machine would probably be easier and or better then using tar as there is no mention in the man page that it will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information.  *See Edit below.\nditto does and more... From it's man page:\n\nditto will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information when copying unless instructed other- wise using −−norsrc .\n  Similarly, ditto will preserve extended attributes and Access\n  Control Lists (ACLs) unless −−noextattr or −−noacl is passed.\n  DITTONORSRC can be set in the environment as an alias to −−norsrc \n  −−noextattr −−noacl on the command line.\n\nEdit:  While the tar man page did not specifically mention \"preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information\" like ditto did nonetheless I'd suggest testing tar and see if it will meet your needs.  I just did a preliminary test on a modified folder that contains a customized image for the folder and it did archive the associated meta-data, at least some of it anyway.  That is to say I didn't test against ditto for comparison nor does that folder have ACL's, etc.\nEdit 2: Considering the comment you made as to why you wanted to use tar and after tests between ditto and tar I'd say tar is probably going to meet your needs.  In either case I like redundancy and I do a Time Machine Backup as well as some other form of archival.  I do a separate image of my Home folder every once in a while to a compressed .dmg file.\n\nA: There's also a command hdiutil which can be used to make a single dmg file from a directory, and the HFS flags are all preserved. \n", "Q: Launching apps behind the lock screen? I need to run an application behind the lock screen, e.g., just as Time Machine or Sophos antivirus (and others) can run when the screen is locked.  \nSpecifically, I would like to schedule an application to launch when the computer is asleep and unattended (but not powered off).  The plan is to schedule wake via Energy Saver or pmset, and use iCal/Automator to schedule the app launch.  The problem I'm encountering is the lock screen (ie System Pref > Security > Require Password).  When the lock screen is enabled the application will not launch unattended - a user must enter the password. By way of debugging I have confirmed that disabling lock screen allows the app to launch, but this is not a solution due to the security issues. \nBottom line: Is there a way to schedule an applescript or shell script (perhaps with root privileges) to grant the lock screen access to the password?   I'm thinking KeyChain should be able to do this, but I can't figure out how.  Or perhaps there are other solutions?\nOther details:\n- I'm running 10.7 and 10.9.\n\nA: Power Manager\nIf you are happy to use a third party application, Power Manager can do exactly what you want.\nThere are lots of recipes to help create your schedule. For your situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Scheduled Power On/Start Up\n\n*Create a Scheduled Application Launch\nBy default, Power Manager will power on a sleeping Mac to perform scheduled events. The recipe above for launching an application will automatically wake a sleeping Mac. You can adjust the event to power on a shut down Mac, if desired.\nPower Manager will launch your application behind the lock screen. This is possible because Power Manager has a helper agent running within each user session. The main scheduler works with the agent to make sure the application is launched in the right user session.\n\nDisclosure: I work for DssW, who make Power Manager; so feel free to ask technical questions.\nFast User Switch\nIf you are concerned about security, consider having the user be switched back to the login window with Fast User Switching.\nWhile Fast User Switched, your Mac can wake to schedule, run the AppleScript, and complete its task while not risking unguarded access to the Mac.\n", "Q: Unable to update any Apps I am unable to update any of my apps on my iPad Air and can not add a new app. When I try to update I get a spinning circle. There has been no error notice. Any idea what the problem is?\n\nA: That happened to me with my iPad Air. I solved it by backing my iPad up to iTunes and then deleting the app from my iPad through iTunes, then I clicked Apply. I then downloaded the app from the App Store again. This will delete any data the app has on your iPad.\nYMMV, as a few months later this app (Pages) was doing the same thing again, so I put it off and put it off and I never fixed it again, but when I updated to the iOS 9 Public Beta on my iPad the app was fixed! So you might just wait a couple of months until iOS 9 comes out and the update should hopefully fix the app for you.\n", "Q: All Desktops swiping brings the app front When an app is selected as all desktops while switching from one desktop to another even though another app is in front of this app, it automaticly brings the app front then puts it to behind again. To prevent this I always have to hide the app before changing desktops. Is there a general setting which will prevent this?\n\nWhile swiping left to right from behind of xcode to front of chrome then goes behind of chrome.\n\n\nA: As long as another app that is set to None or This Desktop in the Desktop you are swiping from is the Active Window, and you did not make the app set for All Desktops active during the session on the previous desktop, then the Window that tracks to the All Desktops will remain in the background without coming forward and then going back. \nThis behavior only happens when the All Desktops App is the Active Window when you swipe to the new desktop. I assume the reason for it is that the OS X designers felt that swiping and hiding the open windows on the new Desktop could cause confusion, so they added this animation to emphasize that the Active App from the previous desktop is deprioritized and that there are open Apps on the new Desktop.\n", "Q: Office for Mac 2016, my Outlook can't connect with my company Exchange Server Installed Office for Mac 2016 last night, but after I've setup Outlook with my Exchange account, it did not work! Which previously in Office for Mac 2011 version, it works just fine, any ideas why?\n\nA: It is very possible that your company is running an Exchange Server that is not compatible with Outlook for Mac 2016. \nCheck with your company's help desk to find out if this is indeed the issue and if so how you can reinstall Outlook 2011.\n\nA: If your version is activated and all you are still experiencing that, I can suggest you to take a look at the credentials that you have for the account, the server info(under \"Advanced...\") and the ports. \nAll could be found by selecting the Outlook, then from the menu you can choose Outlook > Preferences > Accounts > choose the desired account\nAlso make sure that you are using the right account type. \n\nA: Microsoft has crippled the Exchange flexibility - you can no longer manually setup the connection. \n", "Q: If you log out of Apple ID 1 onto Apple ID 2, will Apple ID 1's money disappear? I wish to log out of my dad's Apple ID on my iPad, as I have to join in an iTunes U discussion and the name is displayed as my dad's. There is a lot of money on my dad's Apple ID, and I'm not sure whether the money will still be on that Apple ID if I log out of it. So my question is this: If I log out of my dad's Apple ID and onto mine then will the money disappear? Also next time I log back onto my dad's Apple ID, will the money be there?\n\nA: All account information is stored online, including account balances. Whether or not you are logged in to that account or another account on the iPad doesn't matter, as long as you don't make any purchases on his account.\n", "Q: Boot MacBook to Linux/Windows from TimeCapsule. I love to run different OSs in my 13\" Retina MacBookPro. If I can install Windows/Linux/OSX on the Apple TimeCapsule and can Boot them over network wirelessly It will be awesome. If its possible please let me know how to do that. I will go and get one TimeCapsule.\nIf https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3816843?start=0&tstart=0 is the solution, Please elaborate it.\n\nA: Apple TimeCapsule doesn't offer netboot/netinstall services. None of the essential requirements for such services like NFS (Linux/OS X), http(s) (OS X) or tftp (Linux/Windows) run on the Time Capsule.\nYou need Mac OS X Server, a NAS/Linux server or a Windows Server (I think some pimped Windows Client OSs will do it also) to accomplish this.\n", "Q: Putting files outside the user/home folder Can I put my folders outside the user folder (e.g. on the root of Mac HD), such as personal folder or work folder, where I have many files? The reason I want to do it is that OS X may have performance issues where one folder has too many files (reference), and as a recent Windows switcher, this is more like the partition/disk letter approach to file organizing. I'm the only user of my macbook so there's no privacy issues. When I first copied the files to the root, the os asks for admin password. Will I have issues with permissions if I do that? And in general, what's the potential cons with this and what's special about the home folder?\n\nA: If you create (or rename) a folder at the root, OS X will ask for your password. This is because you do not own the root folder. Once the folder exists, you can copy (or add) as many files and folders to it without having to enter a password. In terms of permissions, the only difference, between such a folder and your home folder, is the home folder has an Access Control List (ACL). Entering the command ls -led ~ in a terminal window results in listing the home folder's permissions. On my computer running OS X 10.10.4, I get the following output.\nDavids-iMac:/ davidanderson$ ls -lde ~\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 20 davidanderson  staff  680 Aug  6 21:51 /Users/davidanderson\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nThe ACL is group:everyone deny delete. I assume denying everyone delete permission prevents the deletion of your home folder.\nOne small point, normally your files are assigned to the group named staff. If you create a folder in the root folder, the group will be wheel instead of staff. You can correct this by typing the command chgrp staff /newfolder after creating the folder. Substitute your folder name for newfolder.\n", "Q: migrating partition to a 2015 MacBook Pro I'm a developer and through the years with my MacBook Pro early 2011 I installed and configured a lot of stuff to help me in my job.\nI would like to buy a new MacBook pro but don't want to spend days/weeks installing everything again.\nSince the Mac migration assistant won't copy everything, is there a way to duplicate the partition from my old mac to a new MacBook Pro (which can't be opened) ? \nedit:\nby \"can't be opened\" I mean I can't take the hard drive and clone my current one with a third computer.\nTo my knownledge the migration assistant won't copy kernel modules for instance.\n\nA: You can use Thunerbolt/FireWire to boot a Mac into Target-Mode to use it as a drive. Than you can clone it using disk utility, like you would clone a regular external drive. Next you'll (probably) need to reinstall OS X on the new MacBook Pro over that partition (so you have the latest OS X with all the drivers for the new device and whatnot), you can either do that by first creating a bootable USB (DiskMaker X is an easy solution for that) or by using Internet Recovery (boot the Mac while holding cmd+alt/option+R).\n\nA: You have several options to clone the main volume of the MacBook Pro (early 2011) to the MacBook Pro 2015.\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the MacBook Pro (early 2011) to the latest Yosemite version\n\n*a Thunderbolt cable\n\n*or an external hard drive\n\n*and/or a full OS X on a thumb drive\n\n*optional a backup/imager app like Carbon Copy Cloner\nThunderbolt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the Thunderbolt cable to the Macs\n\n*Boot the MacBook Pro 2015 to Target Mode with cmdT\n\n*Boot the MacBook Pro 2011 to the main volume and use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone it to the (mounted) main volume of the MacBook Pro 2015.

I just want to add the 13 GB of free space in the bottom to the main Macintosh HD drive. could you please help?\nThank you\n\n\nA: What partition were you running from when you took that screenshot? If Macintosh HD is your boot partition, you may have to boot into the recovery partition in order to modify it.\n\nA: Boot Camp using Apple's supported way is a bit rigid compared to other partitioning.\nIf you want to add the last 13 GB of your Hard Drive to the Boot Camp partition, you may want to try it from within Windows and see, if you can resize it there.\nTrying to add the 13 GB to your Macintosh HD, you will need to know how partitioning works in general, which is independent of my very first statement of this answer.\nHard drives have a partition table, which stores where each partition starts. Since the starting point is an essential information, which holds the information of the size of the partition among other important features of that partition, no starting point of any given partition can be moved without having to destroy and rebuild this partition.\nThat being said: if you like to move down your Windows partition, you will have to move its start point, which in turn requires you to destroy and rebuild the Boot Camp partition.\nIMPORTANT: You definitely want to have a backup of your Windows partition for the following unless you do not miss anything stored on the Windows partition.\nNow with Apple's Boot Camp scheme in mind, you will need to remove the Boot Camp partition (using Boot Camp Assistant), which will expand the Macintosh HD by the space the Boot Camp partition took up (and maybe the extra 13 GB as well, but check this using Disk Utility afterwards and manually expand it, if necessary).  Then again, using Boot Camp Assistant, you recreate the partition with the extra 13 GB of space for the Macintosh HD.\nThere may be other tools to do the above, but neither do I know them by heart nor do I know of their reliability.  The essence is the same for any support program (supported or otherwise) that you cannot move a partition's starting point without destroying the partition first.\n", "Q: Monitor processes during startup that changes umask Two days ago I began noticing permission problems with my web projects, I had to keep resetting permission so apache could read or write. What a pain! After hours of confusion I finally realized that any file created by a process I own receives the permission of 700 and my umask was set to 077. \nI found the OSX 10.3 and up instruction to change my default umask. I made the change and restarted my computer... and again 077. I manually set my umask to 022 like the default would have it be, and about an hour later, while writing this I check my umask and it's set back to 077.\nSo my long-winded question is how can I monitor my system for a process that updates my umask? I would love to launch an agent at the beginning of startup that will check watch and log any process that updates my umask. Is this possible?\n\nA: after further research I realized that it was my Terminal app (iTerm2) setting the umask. This was due to a bug and an update was already available. This issue caused a great deal of stress and setback. \n", "Q: Mac connects to network with no problem but browsers can't connect to websites I am using macOS Mavericks (10.9.5) and Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all do not connect to websites even though the network is clearly connected.\nBut browsing when booted into safe mode works.\nI've read many articles and tried the following solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Set DNS servers to Google DNS and open DNS.\n\n*Reinstalled operating system through the internet recovery.

When i run memtest86 or memtest86+ on my MacBook Pro 8,3 2011 17\" 2,5GHz the machine reboots after a few seconds. I tried 3 different pairs of ram modules. problem persists. I never had any issues running memtest86(+) software on various Macs.\nI wonder if this problem is related to this MacBook model in general or if there's some something wrong with the machine. (Yes it already has the new Logicboard)\n\nA: I had the same weird behavior on a 17\" Macbook Pro (Late 2011). So this is probably not a sign of trouble. I wanted to be sure that the memory was actually OK, and I remembered that there are two versions of memtest86:\nmemtest86 (by PassMark, memtest86.com) and memtest86+ (GPL from memtest86.org)\nThe Passmark versions seems to have more active development at the moment.

I have an iPhone 6 and bought AppleCare for it. The Lightning cable that came with it is starting to split (see the picture). It still charges fine, to the best of my knowledge, but is it eligible for a free replacement under AppleCare?\n\n\nA: I have had the same situation happen to me with 2 phones actually.  Apple did replace them under warranty.\nIf you have access to an Apple Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either walk in or make a Genius Bar appointment\n\n*Be sure to have your iPhone with you\n\n*Apple will need your IMEI number from your device\n\n\n*\n\n*To get the IMEI number go to Settings > General > About (The Apple rep can assist you)\n\n\n\nThey will then provide you with a new cable after verifying your eligibility.\nIf you do not have an Apple Store that you can get to, call AppleCare for instructions.\n\nA: I have exchanged at least 7 of them in the timespan of 3 years dating back since July 2014, ranging from iPhone 5 to iPhone 6. And in my experience they do it for cables that do not charge anymore since they test that sometimes, but there are times that the person doesn't. \nOne time they told me that when rips happen, it's not a defect by the cable but more of a misuse by the customer but he still let me replace it since it was the first replacement for my iPhone on file.\nThey do look for the IMEI from your Apple device to see if it's still under warranty and not the cable's serial number.\nYou should set up an appointment for the genius bar since sometimes the wait is long.\nUpdate for July 4 2017:\nI recently went in with my iPhone 7 to replace a lightning cable. I was denied because the cable I brought in had a serial number that did not belong to the iPhone 7. It seems like they are more stringent on the replacements and you have to start tagging which lightning cables belong to which iPhone. My story is similar to this one:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3t47uh/lightning_cable_replacement_policy_changed\n\nA: This is a design flaw of the cable. The phone end is with a sharp profile change resulting in a stress concentration leading to the premature failure. It seems to be an intentional one so that one keeps buying the overpriced cable multiple number of times. I have several Apple devices, all of the cables that came with them have invariably failed.

Been beating my head against a brick wall trying to connect to my Windows 10 Pro workstation using Microsoft's RDP client for Mac. The symptoms I'm seeing (black screen or frozen screen) are very similar to the issues I had using mstsc.exe on a Win 7 machine.

Okay, so I have a problem. My iPhone 6 died (it runs a non-jailbroken version of iOS, I used it as a test device for development applications, but I didn't do anything crazy with the firmware of the phone). I plugged the phone in and got an Apple logo, and then it died again. It's on a loop.\nWhat it looks like is happening is, when the phone is charging, it's above 5% battery, so it turns on. However, for some odd reason, the phone doesn't turn on all the way when it boots up; instead, it just shuts off again.\nThen the phone goes back to \"charging from dead\" again. It's in an infinite loop.\nWhy would this suddenly happen? It's an unjailbroken iPhone 6 running the latest iOS (non-beta, iOS 8.4). How would I fix this?\n\nA: In such cases I, myself, do a boot into DFU mode which actually uses way less energy mainly because the display stays off. \nThen I wait for about a half an hour and then I reboot the iDevice in order to have it properly booted. \nP.S. Follow this procedure in order to enter an iDevice into DFU mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your iDevice is plugged into a power source via it's USB cable; \n\n*Hold down both Home and Power buttons on the iDevice for about 10 seconds until the screen goes off; \n\n*Keep holding the Home button and release the Power button; \n\n*Open  iTunes to check if the iDevice is connected. A message saying that an iDevice in a Recovery mode is connected should show up.\n\n\nA: Its a software bug it should not boot until the battery is strong enough. Instead it boots to soon and the screen stays on keeping the battery from charging. \nFix one if it does come up to the unlock screen quickly unlock it and then off the screen it will then stop rebooting and charge up.\nFix 2 if you cant get it unlocked hold down the home screen while rebooting and leave it on the screen that says to connect to itunes. Let it charge on this screen with a original charger and cord.\nRemember its the screen being on thats stopping it from charging.\nThis is a defect in the current OS its not reading you battery voltage and rebooting to soon. Ours only started doing this after the latest OS update. \n\nA: I was able to get out of the loop by following the above steps..\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in iPhone into USB on PC\n\n*Hold the home and power button together until screen is black. Release the power button and only hold the home button until iTune symbol appears.  \n\n*Now, unplug the iPhone and plug it into the wall charger, NOT the USB charger on PC.  This action allowed the phone to keep charging without entering the boot loop\n\n*If the Apple logo reappears, then try step 2 again.  \n\n*The phone will clear itself and power again with the login screen.\n\n*It worked for me in less than an hour.\n\n\nA: The phone is stuck in infinite loop because the battery is discharged just enough to boot the phone up after a short charge time; but as soon as the phone goes into the boot loop, the white boot screen discharges the battery below booting threshold and the phone shuts down again and this loop keeps going forever.\nNone of the above worked for me, but this solution worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*plug in iphone into USB on PC\n\n*hold the home and power button together for a long time - approximately 20 seconds. It is really long time, keep holding.\n\n*the phone screen should display the cord and the word itunes\n\n*now unplug iphone and plug it into the wall charger, NOT the USB charger on PC\n\n*this action allowed the phone to keep charging without entering the boot loop\n\n*I charged all night, you can probably just stop after 1/2 hour\n\n\nA: Ok, I came across this same exact problem on my jailbroken iphone 6. I tried a lot of different methods, and even resorted to heating the back of my phone with a blow dryer because a video told me to. After I thought all hope was lost, I tried one last thing, not expecting it to work. \nI held the power on button while inserting the power cable in order to boot my phone into recovery mode. It's important to do this with a wall charger, and not with your computer. Then, I just left it overnight on the recovery screen. \nWhen I came back in the morning, it was still on the recovery screen, so I did a force shutdown by holding the power and home buttons. When I tried to boot it up after, it worked! \nYou just have to keep it charging in recovery mode long enough so that the phone has time to charge itself to a point where it can boot up on its own. Tell me if this also works for you. \n\nA: You might also want to try another charger.  They go up to 3A or even 4A and can can supply the phone with enough power to keep the screen on and charge the device simultaneously.\n\nA: I fixed it. Turns out, the phone was on 4.999% when it was starting. When it hit 5.000%, it started up. Because starting up used so much energy, it used more than the cord could provide, causing it to fall back below 5.000%.\n", "Q: How does a Google iOS app save and restore active accounts across app deletion? On an iOS 8 device, I installed Google Hangouts and upon first launch, it pre-populated an account that was previously associated with a different, and long ago deleted, Google app.\nSince I had just Reset Advertising Identifier, I assumed it must be the Vendor ID (there was another Google app installed on the device). So, I deleted both (all) Google apps on the device, which should reset the Vendor ID.\nI then re-installed Google Hangouts and launched it. It STILL had the old account active. This is not only mysterious behavior, but is also a pretty serious security and privacy vulnerability. When an app is deleted, and especially when all apps from a vendor are deleted, there should be no active accounts or data left on the device.\nAny ideas on how Google Hangouts knows about the old account?\n\nA: Apple advises developers to store app login credentials in the encrypted iOS Keychain. When you delete an app from your phone it doesn't delete the related records from the Keychain.\n\nKeychains are secure storage containers, which means\n  that when the keychain is locked, no one can access its protected\n  contents. In OS X, users can unlock a keychain—thus providing trusted\n  applications access to the contents—by entering a single master\n  password. In iOS, each application always has access to its own\n  keychain items; the user is never asked to unlock the keychain.\n  Whereas in OS X any application can access any keychain item provided\n  the user gives permission, in iOS an application can access only its\n  own keychain items.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/01introduction/introduction.html\n\nA: It probably uses iCloud as a method, possibly the iCloud Key-Value Store.\nAs far as that storage goes…\n\nThe total space available in your app’s iCloud key-value storage is 1\n  MB per user. The maximum number of keys you can specify is 1024, and\n  the size limit for each value associated with a key is 1 MB. For\n  example, if you store a single large value of exactly 1 MB for a\n  single key, that fully consumes your quota for a given user of your\n  app. If you store 1 KB of data for each key, you can use 1000\n  key-value pairs. The maximum length for a key string is 64 bytes using\n  UTF8 encoding. The data size of your cumulative key strings does not\n  count against your 1 MB total quota for iCloud key-value storage;\n  rather, your key strings (which at maximum consume 64 KB) count\n  against a user’s total iCloud allotment.\n\n(Source: Apple Developer Conceptual Reading for iCloud Key-Value Storage's Data Limits, see link above)\nIn short, developers can access data through iCloud's KV pairs through NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore, store objects storable in an NSDictionary (up to 64K per item, up to 1024 keys, and the total size must be less than 1 MB), and retrieve them later.\n\nEdit: iCloud Key-Value storage isn't as secure as Keychains. Google might use Keychains, but they might also store encrypted data on the Key-Value store, considering iCloud has security issues. Maybe use the device's name as a way to de-encrypt?\n\nA: \n...in iOS an application can access only its own keychain items\n\nVendors can share data across their applications, using the Keychain as long as they are using a keychain group, defined in the entitlements in their app bundle; \"it's own\" means vendor, not application.\nAs others have pointed out, the keychain entries may not get cleaned up implicitly. \nSince this widest scope of this type of 'tracking' is limited to a single vendor with apps installed, this significantly reduces the security risk surface area (compared to UUID or UIPasteboard sharing - both removed/closed). \nIt is important to note that Apple's products are currently designed for \"single users\"; Apple does not yet offer user partitioning (for example, any registered fingerprint unlocks the entire device, so if you have a friend/child with a registered fingerprint, they get exactly the same access as you).\nAdding to the answers by DDPWNAGE and Alistair (since I don't have enough rep to comment) but specifying how all Google apps can access exactly one keychain entry.\n", "Q: Turning Off Notifications While Presenting On Yosemite how can I turn off notifications on Yosemite while presenting or showing the screen to someone?\nI know I can set the do not disturb for a time period but I was wondering if there is just an on off switch without having to set a time.\n\nA: You can either use the System preferences- Notifications- and use one of the options there that suits your need to turn OFF.\nOr you can use keyboard shortcuts, in the syst pref- keyboard- shortcuts, and assign a short cut that will turn On/Off the Notification (keyboard is faster) but you have to remember the short cut.\n\nThere is also this method https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/154563/46541\n\nA: *\n\n*Simplest way is Option (⌥) + Click Notification Centre button; top right corner.

It seems unfair to pay so much for the products yet have such a trivial thing as open file access blocked so thoroughly and with such malicious intent! This, not just st for music files, but for ALL files.  \nI have seen two workarounds over the years -- one created a special driver that was used for low-level access to the entire storage device and created its own database with entries for every (music) file. The other method was to set up an FTP server using tFTP - an insecure and pretty featureless protocol.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro SSD - Very High Wear_Leveling_Count Value? I have a 512GB Samsung SSD in a 2014 MacBook Pro that I purchased new around 2 months ago. I installed Smartmontools via Homebrew to take a look at some of the SSD health / SMART data. Everything looks fine for the most part, but one thing that I'm not understanding is the Wear_Leveling_Count which currently has a value of 12895125514.\nThis really isn't my area of expertise but I thought Wear_Leveling_Count was typically reported as either a percentage (indicating the life remaining according to the endurance specifications of the manufacturer), or as a raw P/E cycle count. In either case, the value I'm getting seems extremely high.\nDoes anybody know what's going on here? Am I misinterpreting / misunderstanding something here? Could this potentially be a bug in Smartmontools or the SSD firmware? Smartmontools is also reporting the Wear_Leveling_Count ID as 173 when it should be 177 shouldn't it?\nAs I mentioned, I'm a bit of a novice in this particular area so any info / suggestions are greatly appreciated.\nUpdate: I came across this reddit thread regarding Wear_Leveling_Count: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/31btmz/what_is_your_177_wear_leveling_count/\nAbout halfway down the page there's a Samsung XP941 user (which I believe is the same SSD used in the 2014 MacBook Pro). He reports a Wear_Leveling_Count value of 197, which is much more in line with what I'd expect. It also looks like the Wear_Leveling_Count ID should indeed be 177 (as I mentioned, I get an ID of 173). This makes me think it might be some sort of OS X / Apple specific bug.\nDoes anybody know if Samsung does something different to the SSDs they manufacture for Apple? Smartmontools reports the SSD as an APPLE SSD SM0512F (which as I mentioned, is supposedly just a Samsung XP941). Could something unique to Apple SSDs be confusing Smartmontools?\nThanks\n\nA: I don't know either how exactly to interpret the RAW_VALUE column (the big number in the final column of the line starting with \"173 Wear_Leveling_Count\"), but the most significant values in that line are columns VALUE and THRESH. \nAs long as VALUE stays well above THRESH, your disk should not be approaching its specified end of life yet. I believe the initial value on a fresh disk is 200. When it hits 100 (my value for THRESH), it will have performed as many erase cycles as guaranteed by the manufacturer. After that you're running on borrowed time. On my (relatively lightly used) MacBook Pro, VALUE is 0197, meaning I am perhaps 3% into the life of the drive. \nFor what it's worth, my RAW_VALUE is 12,891,062,312, a little lower than your value of 12,895,125,514 and about 1/1000 of 12,567,284,681,697 (VALUE: 093) and 13,031,154,781,293 (VALUE: 87) reported in one of the other answers. \nFor information, the file system seems have written 5.4 TB on my machine so far:\n175 Host_Writes_MiB         0x0022   099   099   000    Old_age   Always       -       5445917\nWhat matters for the actual life of the drive is not the data logically written by the file system but the actual internal write cycles, which can be significantly different. However, if what I have written so far is about 1/30 of its lifetime limit, that would be about 160 TB which sounds about right for a 256 GB drive like mine.\n\nA: I am running Windows 8 on a MacPro with a Apple SSD SM0512F disk. Lately I've received the following error, which seems to be the same as yours (SMART-value AD):\n\nI've roamed the net a bit, trying to determine if this is a serious error or just misinterpretation/incompatibility between Windows and the Apple disk (this forum post hints the same), but I am starting to believe that it's in fact the disk that is being worn out. \nA thread at Tom's Hardware hints the error might be due to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows prematurely eating up the SSD's life\n\n*This being an actual SSD fault, but Apple trying to keep it a secret\n\n\nUpdate 2018\nI just want to add that this disk actually finally died. It took less than two years from the purchase date. Unfortunately there was no warranty. The Apple ChurchStore wanted $1350 to replace the disk. I fortunately found a used one on Ebay for 1/4th of the price. Works fine till this day. \nI can only speculate in why the disk died prematurely. No good advice to pass on unfortunately. However, at least in my case, the result shows that the SMART detection was unto something. \n\nA: I'm having this problem with two identical iMacs bought on the same day.

I have a 1 TB hard drive on my iMac.  I bought a 2TB external drive for time machine.  It says that it makes backups hourly, daily, and monthly...and then deletes old backups when the disc is full.  Well, I had to wipe my external hard drive and start over tonight because I just kept getting the message that time machine couldn't back up my computer because it was full.  Is my 2TB external drive too small?  It's double the size of my computer hard drive...\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Two TB should be more than enough. It's a good idea to start with an empty HDD, so if you had any data on it; that could be the problem is. It could also be because the drive was configured for Windows OS. \nIf you want to use the HDD as time machine and to store other stuff you should partition it. It's simple just open Disk Utility, select the disk, go on partition tap, and the plus button. Make sure the format is Mac OS Extended, then make the new partition of about 1.5 TB. After it's done, you should see two drives connected. The old one (0.5 TB) should still contain all your data from before if it was less than 0.5 TB. You can just format the new one if you like. Then just restart the Time Machine process; from Time Machine Preferences Pane > Select Drive. \nYou also configure which file you don't want to backup, things which you can just download again, from the options button in Pref Pane.\n\nA: 2 TB is a lot, but, though the initial backup is only 1 TB at most, your Mac will be making daily backups of your files, while keeping the old versions around in case you would want to restore them. Even if you deleted a file off of your Mac, the copy(s) Time Machine made will still exist, (each) taking up space on the Time Machine drive. So, you can see how even 2 TB drive can fill up pretty quickly this way.\n", "Q: iOS 9 Public Beta: Diagnostic & Usage Data not being cleared Normally, syncing an iPhone to iTunes should clear on-device diagnostic and usage data.\nHowever, I'm currently running the latest iOS 9 Public Beta, and diagnostic and usage data is not being cleared (my on-device logs now date back to 07/31/2015).

The . command is the same as source, it calls the shell script and loads it into the environment of the calling shell (as opposed to a child shell). \nSo what you have here is the bash profile script being called recursively.

Also, I tried updating my iTunes version from 12.0 to 12.1 but for some reason the installer keeps having problems.\n\nA: I'm led to believe it's Apple's fault as they have discovered that various sources throughout the world download their music via an illegal source (i.e. YouTube to MP3 converters).\nIf this is the method you use, then no matter how many times you right-click on a song in \"My Music\", click 'Get Song Info' and enter in the correct song information, iTunes refuses to re-hash the information for your selected song.\nEver since Apple's iTunes 12 overhaul, users who condone third-party download sites have been affected.\nThe only way people such as you and I can fix this problem is to either purchase our music from the iTunes Store or subscribe to Apple's \"Music Genius\" promotion -- at a cost of $34.99 annually.\nI'll pass, thanks.

My iPhone's display broke. The phone itself is intact, yet the screen stays black. iTunes on my recognizes the phone, I have synced with this Mac before. Yet when I want to make a backup of the phone, it denies, because the phone is locked with an passcode. But since the screen doesnt work, I cant unlock it. I know the unlock combination. \nCan I still make a backup from my phone without having to replace the display?\n\nA: It depends on if the both the digitizer and the display (LCD) are broken or just the display. If it's just the display, then you should be able to interact with the iPhone, even though you won't be able to see it. In other words, treat the iPhone as if it were fully functional and swipe where Slide To Unlock should be and then type in your passcode by tapping where the buttons should be.\nIf it is both, it will need to be repaired. If it is an original iPhone, an iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, 6, or 6 Plus you will need to buy a digitizer assembly , not just the \"glass\" or the digitizer or LCD separately. If it is an iPhone 3G or 3GS, you can buy the parts separately. As far as parts go, don't buy a $5 digitizer assembly someone made in their garage in China, the best thing is to pay $25 or so and get a good one (not to say that bad parts don't exist at that price).\n", "Q: Purchasing an iMac: when is the entry-level model insufficient? We're looking at iMacs for my girlfriend, and I was wondering: would the entry-level model be sufficient?\nWhen looking at Windows desktops, I tend to suggest a model a few levels above an entry-level desktop. This usually means the PC can be used longer and it will feel like a fast desktop for a while longer.\nIs the same true for an iMac? When is the basic model insufficient? Naturally, this is not a $300 PC, so I would think that even the basic model is a very capable machine. However, for only a few hundred dollars above the entry-level model, CPU speeds are doubled, among other improvements.\nAgain, this is for my girlfriend, and she really only uses it for internet, the occasional movie and listening to music.\n\nA: It depends on what you / your girlfriend wants to do with the iMac. If it is really just used for internet and occasionally watching a movie and listening to music, then an 'entry level' iMac offers more than enough performance. IMHO even an iPad would provide enough performance…\nWe actually use our 5+yr old iMac (Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.66GHz) as a media hub and it works just fine. It's connected to the TV and has a couple of external hard drives connected to it. And when it got a bit slow a couple of years ago we just added some memory, both RAM and HD, and that really helped a lot. Now it's basically never  \nAlso all other apps like Photoshop etc. still work fine on that machine, but since we now have some faster machines in the house, the iMac is basically just used as a media hub. \n", "Q: HD in caddy seems inactive and blocks application this is the premise:\nRecently I removed from my mbp 15 (2012) the internal Superdrive and replaced it with a caddy + 1 Tb hard disk.\nI already replaced the original HD with an SSD. Since I'm a programmer and I work intensively with my mac, I thought installing the caddy+HD was a good idea: this allows me to have intense write/read session over the HD rather than the ssd. Furthermore I moved all the general purpose files on the HD (music, documents and so on) by just copying it.\nThis said here is the strange thing. When I import music into iTunes from the HD it takes so long that the most times it start the color wheel and it blocks iTunes. Or while I'm working on a text file or source file it gets blocked while saving.\nTo me it looks like the hard disk goes to sleep from time to time (randomly????) and it blocks all the applications that are using it. The most obvious and tangible problem is given by the music player (that's why I spotted this problem). Sometime for example it is playing the music and by skipping from one song another it blocks for a while (keep in mind that I don't import things in the iTunes library cause this means a raw copy of the same things.. ).\nAny clue is appreciated in spotting any problem or misconfiguration or whatever..\n\nA: In system preferences -> energy saving you can disable putting HDDs to sleep. If that doesn't help my first guess would be a faulty cable or caddy.\n", "Q: Why Is the Apple Watch Activity App Distance Incorrect by 500m on a 7km Run? Today, I went for a 7 kilometer run on a course with an established distance. I set the MapMyRun app on my iPhone and the Activity App on my watch to record the run.

It calibrates itself when you use it with the iPhone around, and I’m impressed at how accurate it can be. After a few runs, its numbers match quite closely with those collected by my Garmin and with the quarter-mile markings on San Francisco’s Bay Shore Trail, where I was running recently. Unfortunately, accuracy drops significantly if you run uphill (where your stride is shorter) or faster than normal (where it will be longer). \n\n", "Q: Backup failed due to insufficient storage in the iCloud I just bought 20GB iCloud storage.

I am relatively new to the Mac world, and came across Boot Camp, which can dual-boot Windows, which seems pretty cool. I have read through many Boot Camp guides, and know that a USB drive must be used (my new Mac does not have a CD/DVD drive). I do not have any USB drives at the moment that I want to format, and I would like to know if there is a way to do it without a USB drive. I know that it may be harder or impossible to do it without a USB drive, and I can back up my USB, but I would like to be able to install Windows without a USB drive. Alternate question: if I do format my flash drive (64 gb), will I be able to store other files on it, or will it only work with my Windows OS?\n\nA: Installing Windows on a Mac via Boot Camp you only have two choices, DVD or USB.  You also need a Windows DVD (Full Install Media not Upgrade Media) or an ISO Image of the Windows DVD to create the USB Installer via the Boot Camp Assistant.\nYes, you'll be able to use the USB drive to store other files after the Boot Camp Assistant has written the files necessary to install Windows via USB.  However you need to first backup what you have on the USB drive as it will be removed in the process of creating the USB Windows Installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: For use in installing Windows the USB drive will be formatted FAT32 and as such you'll not be able to store files over 4GB in size for use with the \"other files\" you want to have on the USB drive.\n\n\nA: Go to utilities click bootcamp follow the step by step instructions\nFormat the partitioned drive first\nGive the partition at least 40GBs\nMake sure you have a valid copy of windows\nIf you need more help here are a couple of videos with step by step instructions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShdKIMA7gz0 How to Install windows \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9w3sFsiaA0 Make a Bootable usb\n", "Q: New photo library in Photos.app How can I create a new, empty photo library in Photos, separated from my current library.\n\nA: When Photos.app starts, hold an Option Key ( ⌥ ).

I created a mirrored RAID (RAID 1) using 2 Western Digital 2TB external hard drives before, using Disk Utility on a Mac.  For this, it should be software RAID.\nAnd then I got a WD Thunderbolt Duo 6TB, with two 3TB drives in it.\nThe question is, it seems that I can just create a RAID set inside of Disk Utility, as RAID 1, and then I will have a 3TB mirrored drive.  It doesn't say it is software RAID or hardware RAID, and I assumed it is software RAID.  Let's call this Process 1.\nBut when I go to Western Digital's website and downloaded the drive's utility and use it to erase the drive and configure it as RAID 1, close the app, and then use Disk Utility to view the drive, it appears exactly the same as before, as in Process 1 above.\nSo the question is, did Disk Utility create it as hardware RAID?  Can it create it as software RAID too, and how to I tell the difference?\nI assume Western Digital's app should have created it as a hardware RAID, as there is no point in making it a software RAID when the RAID hardware is present inside the drive.\n(I am using OS X Mavericks if that makes any difference).\n\nA: According to this article the \"WD Thunderbolt Duo 6TB\" misses - in contrast to the Pegasus2 series - one essential thing to be able to create a hardware RAID: a hardware RAID controller(-chip).\nSo whether you use Disk Utility or the native Western Digital tools you will only get a software RAID. \nEven with an hardware RAID controller inside an arbitrary device, Disk Utility can't create/handle hardware RAIDs because it doesn't contain the necessary drivers to do so. AFAIK the only Apple tool for hardware RAIDs is the \"RAID Admin\" or \"RAID Utility\" accompanying the Mac Pro RAID Card and Xserve RAID Card.\n", "Q: Update iMovie in OS X 10.6.8 My iMac is running OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).

The report says, this was an issue with:\ncom.apple.WebKit\n\nWebKit is the \"software\" Safari uses to render / draw the webpage. \n\nThis seems to be a problem originating in the OS X graphics frameworks meaning this a software problem. This could be a bug in Safari or something might be causing it.\nI recommend using another browser and seeing if this happens. If it happens in another browser, it could be a problem with OS X and you might need to take a few more steps. \nIf it only happens in Safari, I recommend disabling all extensions to see if one of these is causing the problem.\n\nFrom what I can tell, while WebKit was drawing the image, something \"clogged\" the process. That means it's probably an extension. \n\nA: That log does not show problems with the GPU.\nThe problems come from the Browser you are using (Safari).\nFirst try watching without headphones plugged in.\nNext, try using different browser (Firefox, Chrome...)\nTo verify the GPU is fine, play a video that you downloaded (from your Hard-drive).\nIf above is correct, lets fix your Safari or stay with another browser choice\n", "Q: Why is there a left bracket before my bash prompt? I've notice that after I execute commands, a left bracket character will appear before the previous line. It seems to be partially dependent on what's in $PS1. I've tried unsetting $PROMPT_COMMAND and $PS1 but that did not make a difference. Here is an example of this happening in Terminal.app:\n\n\nA: I figured it out. I went to View->Hide Marks and the [ characters disappeared. \n\nA: The new Marks feature in El Capitan 10.11 Terminal adds structure to the terminal contents by marking prompt lines and other interesting content, enabling operations like navigating, selecting, Copying, Printing and deleting commands or their output.\nSee the Edit menu, especially the Marks, Bookmarks, and Navigation submenus for Marks-related commands.\nMarks are indicated with “square brackets” at either end of a marked line. Bookmarks are a more heavyweight mark—they're used for marking sections with a time stamp or a custom name—and are indicated with thicker vertical lines and a different background color.\nYou can hide the mark indicators if you don't want to see them, with the View > Hide/Show Marks menu item. This doesn't remove marks or prevent the Marks-related commands from working.\nA good explanation of what you can do with Marks and the related commands is found in @nwinkler's answer to this question.\n", "Q: Removing a Jailbreak from an iPhone 4 I jailbroke my iOS Device, but now I want to remove it.

Will it become locked?\n\nA: To answer your question; no, iCloud will not become locked... if you remove the jailbreak correctly.\nFollowing a guide like this one should help you get your iDevice back to its natural iOS state.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a Mac using the USB Cable.\n\n*If you have a passcode on your iPhone, enter the passcode to unlock it.\n\n*Click Settings > iCloud > Find My iPhone and set it to Off.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off.\n\n*Click the Devices icon in iTunes and choose your iPhone.\n\n*Select This Computer under Backups.\n\n*Click Backup Now and choose Backup Apps from the Alert Window.\n\n*Click Restore iPhone and tap Restore in the alert window.\n\n\n\nApple iTunes will now restore your iPhone to its original software state.

I got the job done in Numbers, but only with brute force by creating 28 charts in what should have been two.\nBack in the 90s, when I was using Aldus Persuasion for my presentation needs, I remember there being a dedicated Mac OS charting program called something like Omni Chart (not related, to my knowledge, to The Omni Group) that offered more advanced charts than were at that time unavailable in Excel. Since it looks like I'll be doing more charting in the near future, I'm looking for something similar for OS X.\nA major test of any recommended software would be its ability to easily create a chart like the one below, which shows comparison data for two groups who answered seven questions in two ways each (in this case, how important the question was and how well performance rated). The chart was created in Numbers and is actually fourteen charts, one for each column.\n\nSome points to mention:\n\n\n*\n\n*The above chart is going to be created for dozens of projects in the future, so software price isn't too big an issue. I'm willing to spend money to save time.\n\n*I have a programming background. I'm open to something like the one of the Python charting libraries. I'm not restricted to Python, only OS X (self-imposed).\n\n\nA: You were not able to get Excel to do this for you?\n\nThe only thing I was not able to do was to get the Horizontal labels centered underneath the columns, but you could likely do it by hand if you hid the column labels then manually typed them into the axis label instead.\nThis is how I got to the picture above.\nHighlight A1 to N3 and then select Stacked Columns.\nNext you will want to edit the Data Series to this\n\nThis shows Series 1 in the Y Values... Just select Series 2 and change it to $A$3..$N$3\nYou will have two data series and it will initially be stacked, so you will end up with a y-axis of 16 or so. Leave that for now as it is easier to do all of the formatting before you make the final changes to get it to look like this.\nGo through and change your color scheme for all of series 1 to Green. You will then have to select the even numbered columns and change their fill to the lighter color individually.\nAlso on the version of Excel I am using there is a Gap Width slider under the formatting for Series 1 and 2 (Though I only had to set it once. I am not 100% sure if it is the same on other versions, but I set it to 25% and that gave me the spacing that you see between the columns.\nNext select no fill for series 2. Then change the label color to a darker color so that you can see it. You will also need to change the position to Inside End so that they move to the top of the column Next change the Border to Solid Line and you can choose the dashed line option. I chose the fill as blue as that is what you had.\nNow what you will do is select series two and you will choose Plot Series on Second Axis under Series 2 Format Series. This will drop then down so that instead of starting where Series 1 column ends, the zero-points are made the same for series 1 and series 2. When I did it the scaling was a bit off. So select Vertical (Value) Axis and make the Minimum Bounds to 0.0 and your Maximum Bounds to 10.0 (At least for this data set) adjust accordingly for different data sets under that Formatting option.\nNext select the Secondary Vertical (Value) Axis and make sure that you set all of the parameters to the same settings as you did for Vertical (Value) Axis formatting. This will bring the scaling of the two series in line. You then select None for label position so that The Secondary Axis is no longer displayed on the graph.\nAt this point you are basically done. You can do minor things like deleting the Legend that shows series 1 and series 2 (or you can name them accordingly) and adding gridlines. You could manually go in a move the 7.6 in Question # 1 column 2, so that it is outside of the fill. etc. But you can basically get almost the entire way to where you want to be inside of Excel.\nIf I left anything out just ask it the comments and I'll respond. \nUPDATE\nAs I am a bit of a perfectionist and was really annoyed by the fact you could see the dashed line around the entire border, I worked out the how to cover that up. \nYou would think that the data mapped to the Primary Axis would be in front... NOPE! That would make too much sense to a Microsoft developer... Anyway here is what you do.\nSelect Series2 and Plot Series on Primary Axis. Then Select Series1 and Plot Series on Secondary Axis. Adjust the scaling (AGAIN), and add a solid border of the same color to the fill of Series1 (sorry, but you have to do it for all of the even colored ones individually), and set the size to be the same point size as your dashed border for Series2, and Series1 now covers Series2, like this:\n\nUPDATE 2: Bonus Material\nSo if you need to expand this for more question, insert columns in between the data. The graph remembers everything except the even numbered column color scheme, so you then only need to go in and change the fill and border color to the lighter green and you have added to the graph... Oh and of course you have to fiddle with your solution on the centering of the Question numbers, but probably not as bad as having to do everything manually in OmniGraffle.\n\nA: I know this is a bit obvious but you could try Google Sheets.\nIt's scriptable in server-side JavaScript so if it doesn't do charts like that (and I don't think it does) then you might be able to hack in a solution.\n", "Q: iMac keeps restarting every couple of minutes.

Just today, though, terminal started acting strangely. When I try to run an interactive terminal editor like vim, vi, emacs, or nano, the process is suspended:\n$ vim\n[1] + 3515 suspended (tty output) vim\n\nOf course, I can open it back up with fg, but this is incredibly annoying.\nI wasn't experiencing this issue yesterday. Since then I haven't restarted my computer, iTerm, or even closed terminal tabs (from which I successfully ran vim yesterday without it being suspended).\nAdditionally, I temporarily reverted my shell back to bash. It now exhibits this same suspending behavior as ZSH. This problem occurs both in iTerm2 and the native osx Terminal.app for both bash and zsh, so presumably this isn't an issue with my shell.\nI've been through every solution on the first 10 pages of Google for this issue, but haven't found one that resolves it. I'm approaching the point where I no longer understand why this is happening and therefore can't debug it.\nIs there any way that I can get interactive processes like vim to stop suspending themselves when I try to run them from terminal?\nEdit: Since this post I've tried new iTerm & Terminal tabs, relaunched iTerm & Terminal, and restarted my computer. All of these have failed to resolve this issue.\n\nA: Terminal is suspending the editor because some other process is writing to the terminal.\nRunning stty -tostop should fix it.\nIf that does not fix the problem, take a look at this GitHub issue from the oh-my-zsh repository.\n\nthe issue results from a setting :set shellcmdflag=-ic. After I comment[ed] that out from .vimrc all relevant problems were solved.\n\nOther users have evidently run into this problem. This seems to be the correct solution.\n\nA: Turns out I misread the first result on Google. I incorrectly assumed that they were referring to the terminal shell (and when they said shell later on I assumed they meant $SHELL, although I should've been tipped off by the fact that shell wasn't capitalized). Instead they were referring to the vim shell setting, which incorrectly had the -i flag instead of the -l flag.\nSo in case anyone else has this issue, go into your .vimrc and change make sure the line that sets your shell looks like this:\nset shell=/bin/zsh\\ -l\n\n(Replacing /bin/zsh with the value of which zsh if it's installed in a non-standard location, of course).\nReference commit: https://github.com/devx/vimified/commit/772e130c9c359ac87927a963e00a9cc6597cd170\n", "Q: Migration Assistant completely broken on Yosemite?

At the end of each round, I rebooted the 2015 Macbook Pro, went into Internet Recovery, wiped the disk and reinstalled OS X Yosemite. This took about 2 hours to complete each time.\nRound 1:\nFirst, I attempted to do Migration Assistant from the Thunderbolt HDD to the new Macbook Pro. Everything seemed to go well enough, until the \"Transferring your Applications folder\" screen got down to 3 minutes. At that point, it began to climb...and climb...and climb. After ~72 full hours of Migration Assistant, it was at \"128 hours and 54 minutes remaining.\" I figured, at this point, that something was wrong.\nRound 2:\nI thought perhaps there was something wrong with the Thunderbolt HDD. I plugged it into my 2013 MBP and did verify disk / verify permissions. Everything was reported as OK. I re-connected it to the 2015 MBP and started Migration Assistant again. After ~48 hours of Migration Assistant, it was at \"63 hours and 12 minutes remaining\", and again was only going up - never came down at all once it started climbing.\nRound 3:\nOK, there must be something wrong with the Thunderbolt drive. Verified the external USB caddy drive, everything checks out OK on it. It's been a few days, so I do one last Time Machine to the USB drive to make sure it's the latest and greatest going over to my new machine. Same symptom - around 5-10 minutes remaining, the number starts going up into the stratosphere. Trying to be patient, I again give it 70+ hours...\"106 hours and 49 minutes remaining.\" (As an interesting side note, I checked several times in the last few hours and each time found it interesting that the external drive was NOT spinning at all...)\nRound 4:\nOK, something is wrong with the Time Machine setup. Screw it, let's go machine to machine. Connect 2013 MBP to 2015 MBP over Thunderbolt, start Migration Assistant on both. They refuse to see each other. Fine. Let's try Ethernet.\nRound 5:\nBuy a 1GB Ethernet switch to isolate the two machines, and plug in each using Cat 6e that has been successfully tested to route at least 923Mbps. After ~24 hours and \"18 hours and 26 minutes remaining,\" I give up.\nRound 6:\nBack to Thunderbolt. This time, we'll put the 2013 MBP in Target Disk Mode. OK, they see each other fine, now. ~24 hours, \"19 hours and 9 minutes remaining.\" #$()$%$()!!!!\nRound 7:\nMaybe it's the 2015 MBP. Go to my 2013 iMac, put it in Migration Assistant mode, put the 2013 MBP in \"Target Disk Mode\" via Thunderbolt cable. Everything connects. ~24 hours, \"16 hours and 33 minutes remaining.\"\nAt this point, I have spent nearly two full weeks trying to do ANY kind of migration using Apple's \"Migration Assistant\", and it has been nothing but failure after failure after failure. I could repeat all these experiments with the iMac and the various devices, but a sneaking suspicion has started to form in the back of my mind. So I wipe both the iMac and the 2015 MBP; I do a bare minimum setup of Yosemite on the 2015 MBP, creating just my user account and installing Google Chrome, letting it sync my bookmarks and such. I connect them via Thunderbolt, boot the 2015 MBP in Target Disk Mode, and do Migration Assistant on the (now completely clean) iMac.\nIt has been 13 hours. Migration Assistant says \"6 hours and 43 minutes remaining.\"\nThings that have been checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify Disk\n\n*Verify Permissions\n\n*No OS X updates available for any of\nthe three machines\n\n*All cables used have been tested in other\nuse-cases and worked fine (saved files, copied files from one\ncomputer to the other, etc.)\n\n\nIs this tool just completely broken, or am I missing something? Is there some kind of \"debug mode\" I can put it into where I can see what it is hanging on? Is there a different tool that anyone can recommend that would allow me to perform this kind of migration?\n\nA: Ok, I have actually had this problem a lot as I'm the IT guy at a company that uses Macs and I could never figure out what it was but just found the answer: it's the Thunderbolt Bridge\nOn the computer you're migrating from, plug the Thunderbolt cable in. Then go to System Preferences>Network and make sure that there is a network interface called Thunderbolt Bridge.  If there isn't, hit the plus sign in the lower left corner and add one.\nNow, go into Migration Assistant or Target Disk mode on that machine and go into Migration Assistant on the new machine. The new machine should find the old disk and be able to migrate appropriately.\n\nA: When having problems with Migration Assistant the first thing to do is go back to basics.\nDo the migration one step at a time. When I run into trouble I create a new user on the old machine and migrate just that user.\nI then make sure I clean as much junk out of my account on the old machine. Then try migrating just that account. If you get problems with that then empty out the Documents and Music folder (which is usually where most of the size lives) and try once again. That usually works.\nThen, and only then, try migrating the Applications.\n\nA: Ok I just got a new MBPr 15 and had this problem too. Fresh migration didn't work. If I skipped migrating and used migration assistant later that did work but isnt really a full copy. \nHere is what worked for me. Boot up the new computer into recover mode. So boot and hold 'r'. In recovery mode try using restore from time machine backup. That took maybe 2 hours but worked. \n\nA: I found that turning off WiFi on both machines did the trick; using Thunderbolt cable\n\nA: I had no luck with Migration Assistant either.\nMy early 2011 MBP 15\" video system recently failed (https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/) which requires motherboard replacement by Apple.  It wouldn't boot but the HDD was good, but unfortunately I didn't have an up-to-date backup.  I had a local Mac repair shop pull the HDD and back it up to a brand-new USB3 external HDD.\nMy company issued me a new 2015 MBP 13\" and I wanted to use Migration Assistant to restore my apps, data, configuration, etc. from the external HDD to the new MBP.  Migration Assistant sees the data I want to restore on the external drive, all 371GB of it.  But shortly after clicking \"continue\" on the Migration Assistant screen with the checkboxes for data categories, and amount of data per category, I get a message \"Migration quit unexpectedly\".  No further information.  External HDD is connected to new MBP via USB3.  Same OS version (El Capitan) on old and new machines.  Tried it several times, after cold reboot, with wifi off, etc.  Always the same result.\nMigration Assistant appears not useful, and I'm facing manual migration of data, re-installation and configuration of applications, etc. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202910). Affords a chance for some clean-up and reorganization, but also a big time sink.\n", "Q: How to automatically connect VPN when connecting to a network? In my university, the only way to access Internet is to connect to a VPN server. I've configured the VPN on my Mac and it's working fine, but I need to manually connect to the VPN every time I connect to the University network. How can I configure my Mac so it automatically uses the VPN whenever I'm working inside the University network?\nEdit:\nCan I use AppleScript to achieve this? Theoretically, it should be fairly simple, something like this:\nif NetworkAPI.connectedNetwork.SSID == \"Specific SSID\":\n    NetworkAPI.getVPNConnection(\"VPN Name\").connect()\n\n(I added AppleScript tag to my question to attract people with expertise in AppleScript, but any other method is acceptable.)\n\nA: LifeHacker has answered your prayers (with Apple Script). You will obviously need to replace VPN University with the name of the service pertinent to you, and SSID University with the name of your university's SSID. \non idle\n    set mySSID to do shell script \"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | awk '/ SSID/ {print substr($0, index($0, $2))}'\"\n    if ((mySSID as string) is equal to \"SSID University\") then\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell current location of network preferences\n            set myConnection to the service \"VPN University\"\n            if myConnection is not null then\n                if current configuration of myConnection is not connected then\n                    connect myConnection\n                end if\n            end if\n        end tell\n        return 120\n    end tell\n    end if\nend idle\n\nYou can save this as an application any way you want, I prefer to go through Automator, though Script Editor, AppleScript, or XCode are also capable of compiling AppleScript, save it as an application, mark it to start on log in, then if you want to be fancy, you can either tell XCode not to have its icon on the dock, or edit the .plst file in the application bundle as such:\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string>\n\nThis little hack per user ianneub.\nNote I have tested the applescript piece only on my early '11 15\" MBP OS X 10.10. Your mileage may vary if you're running El Capitan (I bet it doesn't though). This post comes with no warranties of any kind, and may give you gonorrhea.\nEDIT:\nNote I updated the original script to check for a specific SSID, then perform the actions. I'm on my WinXP machine right now, so this is an untested, but relatively safe change. I found the info on getting the current SSID here and info on string comparison here. \n", "Q: Can I dock all my apps at once? I'm using a Mac at my new job and I often want to have a clear view of my desktop quickly. So far I've bound the Exposé - Desktop function to my mouse and it works okay, but the moment I want to just bring one app back from the dock, they all come back and it's frustrating.\nIs there a way to show my desktop and actually put all my apps in the dock, kind of like the bottom right corner of Windows 7/8? There is this restriction that I can't install anything on my work machine. If there's nothing in Yosemite, will there be something in El Capitan?\n\nA: From within the application that you want, just go to the application menu and click \"Hide Others\"(shortcut alt-cmd-H)\nYou can create an AppleScript and/or find third party software(like MagicPrefs) to create a shortcut for this action or an \"App\" in the dock that can do this. \n", "Q: How to keep original \"date created\" when copying via Terminal? There are many questions online asking how to make the commands rsync and cp go about copying a file while keeping the \"date created\" attribute the same as the original instead of the time of copy. I understand this is Mac's added information and is separate from the file's metadata \"date created\" attribute. Anyways, as I played around with rsync -a, it did everything I wanted except, as everyone online notes, it changed the \"date created\" to the time of copy instead of original make. With rsync and cp it changes due to \"a change to the inode\". Command-c command-v, however, keeps the \"date created\" time the same.\nHere's my question: How is it that Cmd-C Cmd-V keeps the date created attribute the same on the copy, yet no command in the terminal will yield this result? If Cmd-C Cmd-V can do it, it seems there has to be some command in the Terminal that replicates this?\n\nA: On 10.10.4, using cp -p /path/to/source /path/to/destination the time created is preserved. More specifically, in Finder, date created and date modified are preserved, while date added will have the copy time.\n\nA: There are many reasons why one would rather use RSync instead of cp. RSync's default version on MacOS is 2.6.9, which is more than 12 years old as of today, and has several known bugs, and this is one of them. Apple won't include the updated versions on the new releases of the Mac OSX because of GPL3-related stuff.\nTo address this issue:\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew in your Mac, if you don't have it already\n\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n*Install the new version of rsync available on brew:\n\nbrew install rsync\n\n\n\n*Verify that your rsync version is at least 3.1.3:\n\nrsync --version\n\n\n\n*Copy your files using the --times and --crtimes\n\nrsync --times --crtimes /sourcedirectory /destinationdirectory\n\n\nA: As stated POSIX does not define \"date created\" and command line tools are written to POSIX standards but may extend the standards. The behavior of rsync and cp are what is expected. Some file systems and kernels extend the standards and include birthtime or btime.\nAssuming you are copying files to the same file system then OS X has tools that will attempt to preserve birthtime (\"date created\"). You could use pax or hardlink files and the \"date created\" will be preserved. Less reliable tools are ditto or cp with the p option (at least on my system, I suspect bugs in HFS+).\nIf you want to copy files to another file system then you need to  compile rsync with the patches fileflags, crtimes, hfs-compression and rsync can handle OS X metadata and preserve the original file's birthtime on the new file.\n", "Q: How to Revoke Automator warning dialog? I clicked unwillingly on \"Don't show this message\" and now it does not appear.\nHow can I revoke it to be shown as previously?\n\n\nA: The solution is to \"Reset Warnings\" in Automator main menu -> \nReset+Restart Automator:\n\n\nA: You can probably \"uninstall\" this particular automator item, then reinstall it, at which point it should behave as it originally did. Assuming this is some an Automator Service or Folder Action you can find the item in ~/Library/Services or ~/Library/Workflows.  To uninstall simply drag to the desktop. To reinstall click on the item and then click the install button.\n", "Q: Finding DVB-T Driver I have a DVB-T dongle which has following information:\n  Product ID:   0x9016\n  Vendor ID:    0x15a4  (Afa Technologies, Inc.)\n\nAfter googling these information I found out the chip model used in this device: Afatech AF9015. I could not find a driver (even a generic one) for it, would you know how to find it?\n\nA: It appears unlikely an OS X driver is available but you may have success with Linux.\nYou could use a virtual machine such as VMWare Fusion or VirtualBox to test the approaches linked below:\n\nTelevision with Linux\nThe LinuxTV community develops and maintains the Linux Kernel Media Subsystems and several userspace libraries and applications.\nThe Linux Kernel Media Subsystems provides support for devices like webcams, streaming capture and output, analog TV, digital TV, AM/FM radio, Sofware Digital Radio (SDR) and remote controllers.

You will then see a folder with various items including subfolders that contain your photos.  I believe the originals are stored in a folder called Master and are organized by date.  You can copy what you want from there.  Some back-up apps will even allow you to sync these subitems as opposed to the entire package.\n", "Q: View recently closed files (e.g., in Preview) on OS X? Mac OS X has built-in features for viewing recently opened applications, or recently opened files in applications.  I open lots of files in Preview and keep some of them open for a long time, usually the ones I am most likely to open again.  So I would prefer to be able to quickly view all of my recently closed (typically unmodified) files.  Is this possible either system wide, or specifically in Preview?  \nNote: There is related program, AppsBar, which allows one to view recently closed applications, but based on the description does not seem to apply to specific files.  If it makes a difference, I am running Mavericks.\n\nA: It is unfortunatly impossible.\nAt the file system level, \nthere are only 3 dates associated with any file or directory:\naccess time\ncreation time\nmodification time\n\nThe access time is modified upon opening a file.\nThe modification time is modified upon writing the file.\nNone of these 3 dates is modified upon closing a file.\nHence the file system doesn't provide a timestamp of the event you are interested in closing time.\nFor example, the access time will show you when Preview opened your file, but if you close it 2 days later, no date is changed.\nThis is a structural limitation at the file system level.\nAt the Finder level the limitation is exactly the same.\nThis might be changed if Apple decided to improve the ergonomy of the Finder so as to be able to open what the human behind the keyboard is working on. And this won't be a programming nightmare. A basic cache of files opened and closed (modified or not), maintened through a count of references to opened files (when ref_count == 0, file is closed) + survey the deep Spotlight harvesting (to avoid to wait it a few hours to free files) would make it.\n\nA: Typically, your recently opened files match your recently closed files. You can increase the number of remembered files using:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > General > Recent Items\n\n\n\nIn Preview.app, you can show the recently open files in three ways:\nMenu Item: Open Recent\nUsing the menu item File (menu) > Open Recent\nDock Icon\nClick on hold Preview.app's icon in the Dock to show the same recent files list. This works even if Preview is not launched.\nSpaces / Mission Control\nWith Preview.app foremost, hold down the Control + Down Arrow keys. This will fade out the application and show the recent documents as large icons along the bottom of the display.\n\nA: One way to see all files you have used over the past nth days, weeks or month is to create a Smart Folder.  One can use very sophisticated search terms and filters or make a few simple rules.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Finder window\n\n*Select File > New Smart Folder or ⌥+⌘+N\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your criteria [File type(s), last opened or last modified, etc.]\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can keep an alias on your Desktop or Dock.

As you probably knows AirPrint doesn't have an option for grayscale or B&W printing.\nMy printer doesn't have a setting to print in grayscale.\nIs there any iOS app that converts a PDF to a grayscale PDF?\n\nA: I have not been able to find an app that would do this for you. It is very possible that Readdle's PDF Office can do this for you, however I do not have this app and it is a subscription premium service. I could not confirm from their website or the AppStore for sure that they have the feature to convert to gray-scale, but they bill it as a fully functional and professional PDF suite. Their app Scanner Pro does have the option to save as gray-scale, but the source has to come from your iOS camera. I could not find an option that lets you import a pre-existing PDF into Scanner Pro. Adobe Acrobat isn't even worth mentioning.\nI also looked at trying printing directly, but like you said, the printer needs to support conversion to Gray-Scale in order for you to be able to print a color document from the AirPrint as gray-scale. I looked at Readdle Printer Pro, however that did not give the option to convert to gray-scale either.\nThat being said, if you have a Mac as well as an iOS device, I can provide you with a bit of a convoluted work around.\nIf the PDF is on your iOS device, you will need to transfer it over to your Mac. You can accomplish this using iTunes, or emailing or messaging the file to yourself, etc. Once the document is on your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PDF in Preview\n\n*Choose File>Export...\n\n*Under Format: select PDF\n\n*Under Quartz Filter: select Gray Tone\n\n*Click on Save\nThe PDF will be converted nicely to a gray-scale document which you can then print.\nSorry I couldn't come up with an actual iOS app that was capable of this.\nI have no association with Readdle other than I have purchased several of their apps for use on my iOS devices, which is why I mentioned them in the post. They build very good apps with functional UI's that are pleasant to work with, which is why I chose to buy these premium apps instead of using free alternatives.\n\nA: With iOS 9 AirPrint now has the option to print Black & White.\nThis solve my problem, there isn't yet an app to convert a PDF to a Black & White/Greyscale PDF but now I can print Black & White and I don't need to edit the PDF before the print.\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: Where can I purchase Female Thunderbolt to HDMI cable? I have a Apple Thunderbolt Display 27 which I want to use on a Windows machine with only an HDMI port.

If the Reminder window is on screen, the script treats whatever items currently appear in the pop-up window as the current messages, even if I first instruct Outlook to make the main mail window active. (I suspect this may have something to do with the fact that the Reminder window is always \"on top\" regardless of what you have selected.) As a result, the script fails when the Reminder pop-up is open (i.e., it indicates that no mail messages are currently selected).\nAre there any suggestions for how I can force Outlook to return the set of messages selected in the main mail window rather than the Reminder pop-up?\nThanks.\n\nEDIT\nBuilding off of the answer below, to minimize the inconvenience of closing the Reminders window, you can add the following code before the call to \"current messages\":\n--Workaround to fix Outlook 2016 Reminders window bug, part 1\nset windowClosed to false\nif \"Reminder\" is in (name of the front window) then\n    set windowClosed to true\n    close front window\nend if\n\nAnd then add this at the end of the script, to re-open the Reminders window if it was closed by the script:\n--Workaround to fix Outlook 2016 Reminders window bug, part 2\nif windowClosed is true then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"9\" using command down\nend if\n\n\nA: I'm an applescript novice, but I was able to add the following code to close the reminders window if it was up when the script ran:\n-- close the reminders window if it is open\nset winName to name of the front window\nif \"Reminders\" is in winName then\n    close front window\nend if\n\n\nA: The solution Eric gave will dismiss your reminders, and the one that OP posted didn't reopen the reminders for me.

I don't know if this belongs on Ask Different, but I reckoned it does because the core of the question involves the SIM card and apple company data.\nMy father got traveller's insurance from Asurion for his iPhone before he went on a vacation to France. He lost his iPhone and they replaced it.\nAll I got from their site:\n\nYou are required to return your damaged or defective device using the prepaid shipping label provided with the replacement device. You will need to return the damaged or defective device within 10-15 days to avoid non-return charges. If the device was lost or stolen, the requirement to return the device does not apply. However, if the lost device is found, you should return it by using the pre-addressed pre-paid return label included with the replacement device.\n\nMy phone is currently broken and he suggested that I put my sim card into his old iPhone. If we do this, will Apple somehow become aware that we didn't turn the phone in even though it was found and notify the insurance company? \nBefore you (possibly understandably) flag this as non apple hardware or software related, know that I perused Asurion's website for this information and couldn't find it. I also did thorough research and since the core of the problem comes down to Apple's data and whether they choose to share that with the insurance company, I decided this was the best place to ask.\n\nA: Apple will not tell the insurance company.

Alternatively, you can reboot holding Alt/Option and you will be asked to choose which disk to boot from. \nWhen you are 100% certain the SSD is working then you obviously have the option of deleting all system files from the original HDD; or keep the system intact and you will have a 100% functioning back-up to boot from in the event the SSD fails.  If you need to maximize storage go ahead and delete all the system files on the HDD.  At that point it should be recognized as a just a storage device, not a start-up drive.  Better yet, you might consider erasing the HDD completely and then re-populating it with your data files.  Of course, to be safe you'll want to create a complete back-up of the HDD before you start any of this.\nP.S. I also have a 2011 17\".  Love it.

Even if there's a software I can download to see the previews, that is fine. It's too much work to convert all of the videos to see what they are.\n\nA: Not sure about the Finder preview function. You would have to find a preview handler written for that specific codec (whatever it might be) and compatible with Yosemite.

I already know individual answers to this but stick with me :) So, the latest AirPort Extreme (802.11ac) says it can do simultaneous dual-band, which is fine when you're using both frequencies together. But if you separate the two by SSID, giving you a dedicated 5Ghz and dedicated 2.4Ghz band, does it still transmit on both of those simultaneously to separate devices? To give you an idea of what I'm trying to do, I want to hook up AirPort Express units around my house to provide AirPlay to assorted speakers in the Kitchen, Dining Room, etc and was thinking, in theory I can have them all operate on say, the 2.4Ghz band while the rest of the house is on 5Ghz, and it should alleviate some network congestion when streaming to multiple units at one time. In my mind, it's like Sonos but a bit cheaper since I have most of the hardware already. This may be completely pointless, so I'm just curious if there's anyone familiar with this or if it's even necessary. I've had multiple people tell me to use the 5Ghz band exclusively since my house is relatively small and I can hit it from almost anywhere. Is my logic misguided?\n\nA: \nBut if you separate the two by SSID, giving you a dedicated 5Ghz and dedicated 2.4Ghz band, does it still transmit on both of those simultaneously to separate devices? \n\nYes (non-issue if the Airport Express units connect on 5GHz).\n\n...so I'm just curious if there's anyone familiar with this or if it's even necessary.\n\nI've had various Airport routers since 2007 and I've always separated the 5GHz channel from the 2.4GHz both at my parents house and in my flat downtown. If you can obtain good coverage with 5GHz then that's preferable because no nearby networks, cordless phones or microwaves will interfere with your music playback.\nThe main problem is not network congestion, it's interference.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch focus between monitors (from #1 to #2) in Yosemite I like having my IDE on left screen and browser on the right one. Whenever I want to refresh page in the browser, I need to move hand from keyboard to mouse. In my previous setup on Fedora I was able to setup a keyboard shortcuts ctrl+1 and  ctrl+2 to focus on the topmost window of appropriate monitor. I feel like this is a very basic task, but I didn't find any solutions. I even read this question:\nKeyboard shorcut to switch focus between multiple displays on OS X 10.9.5 + (mavericks, el capitan, sierra)\nbut it proposes a workaround instead of an actual keyboard shortcut to switch focus. Is there any solution? I am able to buy an app from AppStore if there is one for this purpose, but I would like to avoid non-AppStore apps.\n\nA: You can switch Applications by using ⌘ command+tab. Tabbing through the list of applications can be done by holding the ⌘ command key and continually hitting tab. This will automatically shift focus to the selected app no matter which screen or monitor on which it resides.\nTherefore, swapping between IDE and browser is easily done without mapping new shortcuts.\nThe keyboard command for refreshing the browser is generally ⌘ command+R.\nYou can switch Windows of the same app by using ⌘ command+~.\n", "Q: How to change system \"Hide All\" keyboard shortcut?

I have a Modbook Pro with both Win 7 and OS X installed during build; no media provided.  I got fed up with all the irritations of the modbook and bought a regular Macbook Pro with a larger drive and OS X only.\nIf I create a bootcamp partition that is larger than the previous Windows, and copy the old partition via 'dd,' I will have a partition the same size as before with the remainder 'free space.'  Can I then stretch that partition with Disk Utility to get back the size I want?\n\nA: While you could technically use dd to image a smaller partition onto a larger partition and it still show using the space of the smaller partition you'll not be able to resize the NTFS partition using Disk Utility.  Also the GPT and PMBR will not be synced and that will need to be resolved. Windows 7 will also need to be reactivated.\nThat said, using Winclone (at least Standard version) would be a much better option as it will handle what's necessary that Disk Utility can't, except for reactivating Windows, which is totally a Microsoft issue in resolution.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Windows 7 installation, USB is not recognized only on bootloader I'll abstract my question.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using MacPro4,1 Early 2009.

Since your question may simply boil down to \"what is a kernel\" and \"why did this happen\", let me try to explain the jargon.\nThe software on your computer exists in levels. For instance, there is a part called the windowing system. This is not an application you run, like Safari, but software that is called bySafari in order to draw the window, into which Safari draws webpages. The windowing system, in turn, doesn't talk to the hardware directly, but talks to a lower-level software module that allows it to draw lines on the screen. Anything you do on your computer moves through these kinds of \"levels of abstraction\" until it gets to the software that talks directly to your hardware.\nYou kernel is the lowest level of software. It talks directly to your hardware and exposes all the things your computer can do to higher-level processes and modules.\nThe reason these levels are important is that the higher up something goes wrong, the better your computer deals with it. If you try to open a file that doesn't exist in Safari, Safari will give you a friendly error, which you can use to correct the problem. If something goes wrong in the windowing system, things might start looking funny, or your mouse pointer may suddenly disappear.\nA kernel panic happens when something goes wrong in the kernel. As you can guess, the resulting behavior of your computer is the most unfriendly possible. The best you can hope for is that your computer stops in its tracks and prints out a string of obscure looking information, as it did in your case.\n\nA: In general, a kernel panic is defined by Apple as \"In UNIX, a panic is an unrecoverable system error detected by the kernel.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*That quote comes from Apple's Technical Note TN2063: Understanding and Debugging Kernel Panics\nIn your specific case, the main program that starts and stops everything else on the system has an unrecoverable error in one specific instance at one specific point in time.\n\n\n*\n\n*launchd is the failing component that needs to run always.\n\n*The rest of the information would need to be looked at by an engineer, Typically one employed by Apple, that has a deep understanding of the lowest level of code that runs on the processor. \n\n\nThe next steps for you will depend on how often the error happens and if the machine can start itself up after you power it off.\nYou could also review these two questions for more details on how to troubleshoot your computer going forward if you wish.\n\n\n*\n\n*Understanding kernel panic error log\n\n*How can I troubleshoot Kernel Panics on my iMac\n\nA: (I'm Not a Mac person, but this applies to many Unices) A kernel panic is basically the Unix equivalent of the modern Windows Blue Screen of Death - an unrecoverable error detected by the kernel, ie the core of the operating system, the part that manages things like processor time, memory, disk access, etc.\nThis may be caused by a problem affecting the kernel itself (including hardware or (much less likely on Mac than on Windows) driver problems), or by (as in this case) an error causing the init process (in the case of Macs, this is launchd), which is responsible for (directly or indirectly) running all the other processes on your computer, unexpectedly exiting. When this ends, it effectively brings down everything it's started (ie every other process on the system) with it, so the kernel has no option left but to panic.\nHope this helps you understand the general concept, I'm afraid I can't be any more specific as then I'd be going into Mac-specific things with which I'm not familiar.\n\nA: As mentioned a kernel panic is when the Operating System (MacOS) crashes. This might be due to a hardware issue which you can largely rule out by running Apple Diagnostics to check your Mac. However it is most likely to be down to some dodgy software on your system so you'll need to investigate - either:\n\n*\n\n*Top-down: eliminating various software packages (stop running them and/or uninstalling them), till it stops crashing, OR\n\n*Bottom-up: reinstall the MacOS and then slowly reinstalling your software till your see the crash again.\n\n", "Q: Renew Apple Developer Program with different email address I am thinking to renew Apple Developer Program with a different Apple ID. Reason: There is a big mess in my iTunesConnect dashboard. I have started a lot of app, but not yet approved, and I do not want to continue them, or just created to claim for the app name. So it is hard to delete them. And CloudKit Dashboard is also messy. There is plenty of container I have to scroll a lot to find the appropriate one. \nI thought I remove all my apps from App Store, and I will resubmit with my new developer program from new account.\nDo you know any drawback?\n\nA: If you need to preserve any of your apps, contact Apple developer support directly before you do anything. They have telephone support as well as web support and have been very helpful in helping me (and several of my clients) in situations exactly like you describe.\nFor us, if time deadline was pressing due to business needs - we simply paid for a new account and got to work until the deadline passed and then support personnel assisted us with transferring assets and/or crediting us with extra time since we had renewed earlier than normal.\nIt's usually far simpler to just fix the issues with the problematic account.\n", "Q: What should I know about replacing my computer's battery? My early 2011 13\" MBP has been telling me to \"Replace Soon\" the battery, and today it's finally getting its wish. I know the hardware procedure, courtesy of iFixit, but is there anything else I should know about it?\nSpecifically, I'm wondering: Will everything still be on the computer after I boot up again (I know my files will still be there, I'm just wondering about stuff like saved application states), and is there a specific charging procedure I should follow to \"properly\" break in the battery?\n\nA: Here are some tips about the batteries that go inside Apple computers and devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*lithium cells will catch on fire and burn with such intensity that they can ignite almost anything that is combustible if you damage during the replacement. To save space, Apple engineers designed the case of your MacBook to protect the battery - once you open the case, the battery is extremely vulnerable to physical damage or a short circuit. If you lose one tiny metal screw behind the battery and then shut your case it could easily squeeze, crush or puncture a battery cell - setting you up for disaster down the road.\n\n*that being said, assuming you power off your Mac before you start the replacement, you won't lose any data and you probably won't damage anything else as long as you are slow and careful. Pay attention to not damage the delicate cables or lose any parts. Be willing to take it to a trained technician if you can't be absolutely certain you did the replacement right.\n\n*dispose of the spent battery properly and insure it is safely protected and packaged so it doesn't get punctured and start a fire.

Have you tried to see if you can do that through the UK online store? \nIn general the retail stores stock a subset of all of the standard models in some cases they even stock custom build versions that are popular in that specific location. Also, refurbished products are so limited compared to the normal production that it all gets held at central shipping locations and you can only buy it online. I have heard of businesses ordering tens or dozens of Macs when there's enough inventory for refurbished products, but you would then be working with a business specialist in that case to work up your quote and they could answer all of your questions during the pre-sales discussion.\nYou could try looking up the contact information for the specific store you intended to shop: http://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/\nMy understanding, is that the stores are staffed to handle the people that walk in physically as opposed to field phone calls and email messages from potential shoppers. That being said, a polite email or short call might be worth your time to gather information about refurbished products in that specific market.\nEither way, you should go visit the stores in London for I hear they are amazing to witness in person.\n", "Q: Different values for du and du -h On the command line, du seems to return twice the numeric value returned by du -h. \nApparently, du -h resembles the actual file size, so what's the plain du value representing?\n\nA: \n-h \"Human-readable\" output.

However, as long as there are executable files, the completion never shows directories that share the same prefix. Only after entering Publ, the tab completion gives me Public/ as there are no more executables with that prefix.\nSo my question would be, is there an option to have the completion directly show executables and directories with the given prefix?\nI already tried upgrading to bash 4 and installing bash-completion via homebrew but that did not help. I suspect that either the MacOS readline behaves differently or that there are some more setting for .inputrc which I do not know about.\nI further know that by starting with ./ I only get directories. This is the bandaid that I use at the moment.\n\nA: as far as I know, it's a feature, not a bug. \nyou could just change to tcsh, here is a guide (eventually you have to install it via homebrew, then adapt the path) \n\nA: For most shells with a file expansion function what is expanded in argv[0] position is an executable found within one of the directories of the PATH variable.\nIf you want to find directories when entered as 1st argument within bash or zsh, simply modify PATH as follows:\nPATH=${PATH}:.\n\nand test it with:\nPubtab\nFor tcsh the equivalent modification of PATH is obtained with:\nsetenv PATH ${PATH}:.\n\nWarning\nTo include . into the PATH variable is a security risk.\nSince this modification any file in the directory where you are will be found as a standard command. This might lead you to execute files you\nwould never had tried to execute otherwise: executables which will cause a\ncore dump in a development directory, or binaries which will make you\nexecute commands to get priviledged access to your system.\nThis risk is the same for any Unix like OS.\n\nA: Try it with \n./Pub[tab]\nthe ./ makes it the current directory to start the tab-completions from\n(I'd like to know know how this isn't usefull, as it works that way on Linux too?)\n", "Q: iPhone will not connect to corporate WPA2/Enterprise network Starting today all iPhones on our corporate network are unable to connect to any of the 4 WiFi access points.

I just made a complete backup with Carbon Copy Cloner, and I also have a full Time Machine backup.\nWhich should I use -- Time Machine backup or CCC -- and how? I want to avoid having to reinstall software and zshell settings and so on as much as possible.\n\nA: Time Machine would be your best route. Boot the new computer up holding Command + R and then in the Recovery utility, select \"Restore from Time Machine backup\" - assuming it is a full backup, it should work OK.\n\nA: Time Machine would be the most reliable of the two. \nCCC is brilliant for cloning to the same hardware, but it's not really meant to cross to newer hardware, as it has no 'installer' process to prepare for the new hardware/OS drivers. \nHowever, a better option may be ...\nYou can migrate directly from the old Mac to the new, as part of the \"welcome to your new Mac \" introduction, if both can be on the network at the same time.\n\nA: Both of them have their pros and cons and it becomes a opinionated question.\nIn my experiences, I got the feeling that the CCC might be the faster option compared to TM, having just restored ±680GB over a 12hour timespan ffrom 7200RPM HDD over SATA 6GB to striped Fusion drives. \n", "Q: How do I tell other users/contacts my iMessage is turned off?

I frequently turn my son's data plan off mid-month because he eats up most of our shared data.  \nWhen I do this, however, he no longer can receive iMessages until he is connected to WiFi.  The sender doesn't usually receive a message of \"not delivered\" for some reason or if they do it's hours later.  Non iPhone messages are not a problem which I understand why.

I changed my mind about iMovie and so deleted the application. But still it is trying to update iMovie and started downloading it again. How do I let AppStore know I don't need the update and don't show me future updates for iMove?\n\nA: If you hold ALT/OPTION, the Appstore (on the purchases tab) gives you an option to cancel the download (assuming it is incomplete).\nDepending on the version of OS X you have additional steps may be required to remove the application support files (in /Library/Application Support/).\nAppcleaner can be used as well, it does a good job of finding the dependencies; but to enable the removal of system and default applications you need to change the Appcleaner preferences.\n\nI've never needed these options, so proceed with caution.\nThere is a debug menu in the Appstore that has several more advanced options for controlling the application. Resetting the application may help in this case. \nAnother option, but that it is ideal is to let the update run (possibly reinstall it first) and then uninstall it again. \n\nA: I could suggest AppCleaner for a solution. \n\nYou will have two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can select \"Applications\" from the menu bar on the AppCleaner's window and scroll down until you find the desired application. \nYou may select it(if it's locked/stock app, you may need to click twice faster in the checkbox). Going forward with the procedure by pressing the \"Search\" button will bring up a list of of all related files. Note that some of them might be locked as well, so the above double-click procedure will apply again. \n\n\n*Right after you open the app, you will have it as free space where you can Drag&Drop the application that you want to remove and it will find all related files that needs to be deleted\n\nNote: However, this method may not apply for the stock Applications, so you may need to follow the other method. \nAlso note that at the end of both procedures you will be required to enter administrative password in order to give access to AppCleaner to move the application to the Trash. \n\n\nA: I deleted the app with finder.\nThen I still had the appstore prompting for download iMovie which was irritating so I ignored the prompt to update.\nThen upon reading advice here I went back to finder/applications and there was a folder labeled imovie 9.09 so I sent that folder also to trash. \nThat solved my problem.

It is only cracked mostly at the bottom around the home button and just barely in front of the actually display so they said not to worry about it (I did mention that it is a VERY good friend, right?)\nAnyway, I am going to replace the screen (have done several iOS device screen replacements) but I found one that says to make sure that the phone still has iOS 8.x, not iOS 9.  Why?  I don't want to \"fix\" the phone and make it not-upgrade-able.  That is not really fixing it.\nIn my searching I have found old postings about screen issues but none ever seem to be tied to an iOS version.\nEDIT: The vendor SPECIFICALLY says:\n\nThis screen just fits for the IOS 8.3 SYSTEM,the original version,but not fit the newest IOS 9.0 system.  Please make sure your Iphone keep the IOS 8.3 system before installation.\n\nIs there any firmware on the screen itself?  It is on eBay so I have used the \"ask seller a question\" but not sure how thorough/technically sound their answer will be.\nEDIT 2:\nThe vendor's reply was what I expected, not helpful.  Just regurgitated the same statement worded slightly different even though I specifically stated that I am tech savvy and would like a detailed, technically sound answer.\nAs I continued on my quest I thought about the fact that the phone was still under warranty and I did not want to void the warranty.  My friend has \"Apple Care\" and had already used one screen replacement.  He used his second one for this (I paid the $80 + tax + gas money) and told him if it happens again I would pay the difference between the \"Apple Care\" cost and whatever they charge him so that it won't be any difference out of pocket for him.\n\nA: There is firmware on all replacement parts. I'd just wait until iOS 9 comes out in September to make sure that the screen is compatible with the new software, just make sure you can return the screen. However, there are some better vendors, like iFixit, that would likely sell screens that will likely be compatible with iOS 9, just be prepared to pay an arm and a leg.\n\nA: I saw the same thing on an eBay listing from a \"USA\" seller of decent screens. I think they are just confusing the home button with the screen out of ignorance. You have to keep the original home button to do updates or restore your phone. This is true for iPhone 5s on up through 6. It will throw code 53 otherwise. Please post if someone knows otherwise on the actual screen itself. Only the beta for 9 is even out yet. \n", "Q: How to unrate multiple album ratings at the same time? I'm using iTunes 12.2.1.16 and today I realized that there is something called 'album rating'. This messes up my ordering according to the track rating. Suddenly there are songs appearing with hollow stars that I never rated.\nI found out that this is the automatic album rating from iTunes. So far so bad. I also managed to disable it for one album.\nBut how can I unrate my entire library? In the album view I can select multiple albums, but not set the album rating...\niTunes driving me crazy again...\nIt's about deleting the album rating, not the track rating.\n\nA: I was looking to do the same thing the OP requested here. This was my solution:\nOpen the Music app (formerly iTunes in macOS 10.14 and earlier) and do one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*create a new smart playlist with the criteria that album rating does not equal zero stars (the star to the left of the first star) then open up that smart playlist and select all the songs therein\n\n*sort tracks by album rating and select all the songs that have a non-zero album rating.\n\nNext, open up Script Editor.app and paste in the following script:\ntell application \"Music\"\n    repeat with theSong in selection\n        set album rating of theSong to 0\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nYou may need to run it more than once as it may fail as the selection changes while songs are being removed from the smart playlist. After a successful execution, all manual album ratings will be removed. Some albums may still have grayed out ratings: these are from the song ratings themselves and aren't actually album ratings.\n\nA: I was also having trouble with getting rid of the normal Rating hollow stars, as opposed to the Album Rating stars (which I didn't even know they existed). What finally worked for me was to show the Album Rating as an option on the column, then manually delete them off the ones that were showing on the Rating column as hollow stars, and it worked!, I just picked any rated song from that given album and it took away all of them in that album. Hopefully this makes some sense.\n\nA: There is currently a defect in iTunes which is causing some albums to attain USER ratings (black stars) instead of ESTIMATED ratings (grey stars). When this happens, it causes the album's individual tracks to have ESTIMATED ratings (grey stars), which messes up your smart playlists.\n\nA: I think if you dismiss the field you will be happy.  Also rate the a song's album rating to just before the first star (NO stars). \nSelect “Grid View”\nPress “Apple key ⌘ + A” to select all – CTRL+A if you’re using a PC\nRight click and select “Album Rating > None”\nBy right clicking on the column header line you can add or delete field columns.\n\n\nA: DougScripts has an AppleScript that will do this for you for selected songs, playlists, or your entire library.\n\nA: Albums are rated on an average of the Track ratings making them up.\nAs far as I can see, you cannot eliminate one without the other, though you could just hide the column & see if it works for you.\nTo clear all ratings... both Song & Album\nYou cannot undo this, so don't try it just to see...\nGo to My Music.\nSort on the right by Songs.\nRight click the header if 'Rating' is not one of the headers & add it.\n Cmd ⌘   A  to select all\nRight-click one song & select rating/None\nDone.  \nAll ratings are cleared.\n", "Q: How to drop files from Desktop to Finder windows in a sane way?

Can I somehow set hot corner to minimize all windows instead of just showing Desktop for a second? How's that useful?\n\nA: There are multiple ways to achieve it. \nUsing hot corners\n\n\n*\n\n*Slide Your mouse to the hot corner to show Desktop\n\n*Drag Your file (do not drop)\n\n*Slide once again to hot corner\n\n*Drop the file to the app \n\n\nUsing keyboard shortcuts\n\n\n*\n\n*Show Desktop with ⌃ CTRL+↓ Down arrow\n\n*Drag the file (You may need to click on Desktop first to activate Finder)\n\n*Then ⌘ CMD+⇥ TAB to previous app and drop it\n\n\nUsing the trackpad\n\n\n*\n\n*Show Desktop with gesture (spread four fingers on trackpad)\n\n*Drag the file\n\n*Slide on top of the app icon on Dock\n\n*Slide on top of the window You want\n\n*Drop the file\n\n\nA: I would just open another finder window, open a new folder in it.

So I've looked around and couldn't really find an answer to this.\nI have an iPhone (jailbroke) and I notice in several settings there is a string usually in the .plist files that say something similar to \"TimeIntervalSince1970\". Now I know that all timers such as these need a base date and time to start with. \nBut my real question is why 1970?\n\nA: Not everything counts from 1970.  Its the standard time of Unix.  \n\nUnix time, or POSIX time, is a system for describing points in time,\n  defined as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight proleptic\n  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970, not counting leap\n  seconds.\n\nUnix Time\n\nEarly versions of unix measured system time in 1/60 s intervals. This\n  meant that a 32-bit unsigned integer could only represent a span of\n  time less than 829 days. For this reason, the time represented by the\n  number 0 (called the epoch) had to be set in the very recent past. As\n  this was in the early 1970s, the epoch was set to 1971-1-1.\nLater, the system time was changed to increment every second, which\n  increased the span of time that could be represented by a 32-bit\n  unsigned integer to around 136 years. As it was no longer so important\n  to squeeze every second out of the counter, the epoch was rounded down\n  to the nearest decade, thus becoming 1970-1-1. One must assume that\n  this was considered a bit neater than 1971-1-1.\nNote that a 32-bit signed integer using 1970-1-1 as its epoch can\n  represent dates up to 2038-1-19, on which date it will wrap around to\n  1901-12-13.\n\nWhy is 1/1/1970 the “epoch time”?\n\nA: The Unix timestamp starts on 1st January 1970 and counts up since. Time in terms of days/months/years/etc is calculated from this number, accounting for time zones and other regional differences.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Won’t Turn On or Wake Up?

The only thing I can think of is that the battery got disconnected, but that's not likely. The best thing to do is to sell \"For Parts or Repair\" on easy to pay for part of a used iPhone, but older models can be pretty inexpensive. A used iPhone 4 should cost only about  $75-$100, while a 4S should run $110-$130, a 5 for about $200, and an iPhone 5S for about $350.\n", "Q: How do you unshare or remove a person from your iCloud photo album?

This is caused by a faulty nVidia chipset used by Apple. \nhttps://www.apple.com/au/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nNot sure if they still offer this, but they were offering to replace the motherboard for a long time, however, you should book a genius appointment to see if you are affected. \nUnfortunately, they don't seem to replace the chipset with something that works, so your computer will most likely still have this problem in the months after it is fixed by Apple. \n\nA: The first thing I would check would be the RAM, either swap it out for known working memory or just re-seat it.\n", "Q: Yosemite Installation Error \nOkay, so every time I install Yosemite on my iMac, it gives me the same response.

The script talks to the Reminders.app in order to pass iCloud reminder entries to a few parsing scripts on my mac.\nBut when I try to launchd it, a few errors pop up in the system log:\nAug 11 16:43:07 machinename osascript[19678]: Performance: Please update this scripting addition to supply a value for ThreadSafe for each event handler: \"/Library/ScriptingAdditions/FITS.osax\"\nAug 11 16:43:07 machinename osascript[19678]: Performance: Please update this scripting addition to supply a value for ThreadSafe for each event handler: \"/Library/ScriptingAdditions/SIMBL.osax\"\nAug 11 16:43:07 machinename tccd[3421]: Unable to prompt for client without display name (osascript)\nAug 11 16:43:07 machinename Reminders[18838]: Error: Event Not Permitted for command Intrinsics.get\n    Direct Parameter: <NSPropertySpecifier: scriptingReminders of scriptingLists named \"Today\" of scriptingAccounts named \"iCloud\">\n    Receivers: <NSPropertySpecifier: scriptingReminders of scriptingLists named \"Today\" of scriptingAccounts named \"iCloud\">\n    Arguments:     {\n    }\nAug 11 16:43:07 machinename com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (local.reminders.taskpaper.sync[19678]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1\n\nThe SIMBL Performance error I believe to be harmless -- this is a known issue.\nI am assuming likewise for the FITS error.\nBut I need some help resolving the tccd and Reminders errors....

While it is easy to add .app programs to this list (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility), OS X doesn't allow binaries to be added through the GUI. See Jacob Palmela's blog for how to add a program via the command line, or just copy and paste the following command, substituting in the path of the program to be added where indicated before executing: \nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \"INSERT or REPLACE INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceAccessibility','PROGRAM-TO-BE-ADDED',1,1,1,NULL)\"\n\nsudo is necessary because the sqlite3 db file is owned by root.\n", "Q: Can Apple collect my used Mac's serial number and other hardware information if I use my Apple ID on it? I am doing research on privacy, and I need to know if Apple has the ability to pull hardware/software information from a device that has used an Apple ID to log into it and make purchases off the App Store.\nSpecifically, I need to know if by using your Apple ID to sign in to an apple device and make purchases, that Apple will take your Apple ID and associate it with that new device's serial number.  In other words, can Apple automatically or manually retrieve the serial number from a device simply by a user signing in with his/her Apple ID?\nIf the answer is YES, then this would mean that by signing into a device with your Apple ID would result in you providing Apple with your serial number with or without your consent OR knowledge.\n\nA: Can they, yes.\nDo they any/every time you sign in to the App Store, I think not. \n\nApple would probably be able to collate your device's anonymous and unique ID with your Apple ID if you opt in or agree explicitly to a question that informs you that the serial number will be checked to verify eligibility for a specific product. \nYou might capture the serial number to iCloud if you are opting into trusted devices, two-factor authentication or find my iPhone / find my Mac. It's debatable whether Apple actually links that serial number to your account though, since they could stored in the way that let's you retrieve your serial number from all the possible ones as opposed to just storing it directly in the database. \nAlso, your question is extremely broad due to the fact that Apple ID can be used windows, on web browser sessions, on iOS devices, Mac devices, on airport devices, and on AppleTV space (currently). Furthermore, AppleID can be used with far more services than just the App Store so as you see with iCloud, it can get more complicated than yes/no.\nOn operating systems, Apple provides a security and privacy preference that allows you to opt in to sharing diagnostic information which could under some circumstances include serial number. More recent OS include a randomly generated GUID to help anonymize reports. You also can regenerate that ID on-demand on IOS to further enhance your privacy.\nApple has clearly stated many times on the record that they wish to collect as little customer data as possible, and retain that data for short periods only. Apple  appears to minimize even further personally identifying information and that the consumer should clearly opt into these collections.  \nFrom where I sit, Apple has delivered on those promises in the software they design and ship. I also think your question is an extremely valid one, we all should be thinking so clearly as you are about the information we routinely provide to large corporations and how it either allows them or prevents them from invading our privacy and selling us out to the highest bidder.\n", "Q: Replacing the Internal Time Capsule Hard Drive I'm trying to install a new hard drive in my TC after the original one died, but to no avail.\nI bought a 1.0TB 3.5 WesternDigital SATA disk and formatted it for OS X using a SATA-USB connector. It worked and the disk is usable. BUT as soon as I plug it back in TC and power it up, TC displays its amber non-flashing light and its wifi stops working.\nHowever if I remove the HD, the wifi gets back on its feet...\nMay some TC genius come to the rescue of my troubled soul.\n\nA: You need to let the TC format the drive. If you can't make that happen using a reset + reconfigure from the AirPort utility, you might have an incompatible drive (i.e. Needs more power or cannot be used due to incompatible features).\nIt's not going to work like an external drive that happens to be built in, the TC OS needs to manage the disk. OS X can read such disks, so it might seem like any normal formatted disk if you hooked up the old one.\nIf you still have the old drive, you might have more luck cloning it to the new one prior to installing it. \nAlso, if wifi doesn't work, ethernet might still work, especially if the Time Capsule needs a reset.\n", "Q: Trackpad unresponsive, or reverted and speed very fast My device: Macbook Pro early 2011, Yosemite 10.10.4\nSince a bit more than a month now, I experience some problems with my trackpad.\nAt first, it would start to be reverted with very fast speed (basically, it's almost impossible to click somewhere you want to. It was happening from time to time, maybe 2-3 times a day, sometimes there was no problem for 1 or 2 days. A reboot would fix it.\nSince a week or two, the trackpad gets unresponsive for few seconds before getting reverted with high speed, and sometimes (quite rarely actually) it goes back to normal.\nIt tried to reset PRAM, reset the SMC, unplug and replug the battery, clean completely the trackpad, unplug and replug both ends of the trackpad cable.\nIt always comes back. Since a few days it's more and more often. Like usually, a reboot fixes it but now, it might come back like 2 minutes after a reboot.\nI just did a reinstall (just a reinstall, keeping all my data and applications), and it didn't fix it at all.\nI noticed recently as well that the keyboard might be unresponsive for a short time but I thought it might be because of CPU use or whatever but I start to think it's link. Although it doesn't last long at all.\nI don't know if it's a software or a hardware problem. I would be okay to change the trackpad and the cable if I was sure they were the problem.\nHere are the logs from the Console when the problem occurs.\n12/08/15 09:10:56,985 hidd[104]: MultitouchHID: Error 0xE00002C7 getting detection options\n12/08/15 09:10:57,000 kernel[0]: AppleUSBMultitouchDriver::_deviceSetReport -

If you need more information, don't hesitate.\n\nA: To me it seems like you've done everything possible to get that trackpad to work and it just won't. It sounds like the trackpad part has just simply gone out. According to your post, you know how to take your MacBook apart to get to the trackpad, so it shouldn't be much trouble to repair it yourself. Also, trackpads are typically pretty inexpensive, around $30. If I were you, that would be my next move.\n\nA: Use an external keyboard/mouse (USB) to isolate your internal hardware or software.\nAlso, boot into \"Safe\" mode to see if any of your installed software is causing a conflict.  \nFrom https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14204?locale=en_US:\nStarting up in “safe mode” may help you diagnose problems you’re having with your Mac.\nNote: To print these instructions, open Help Viewer’s Action pop-up menu (looks like a gear), then choose Print.\nShut down your Mac and wait 10 seconds.\nPress the power button.\nImmediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.\nYou should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear the startup tone, but not before.\nRelease the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator (spinning gear).\nTo leave safe mode, restart your Mac normally without holding down any keys during startup.\n", "Q: How to free up Message's \"dead space\" while preserving some conversations? There are many reports that the previous versions of the iOS Messages app did not properly free up space when conversations were deleted and every subsequent restore from backup carries this \"dead space\" over. And, since they are deleted, there is no way to regain that space because there are no UI elements for those conversations.\nFor example, my Messages is using up nearly 2 GB of data, but when I examine my conversations and their attachments, they don't add up to anywhere near 2 GB.\nHow can I regain this dead space?\n... given these constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*Retaining some of my conversations (i.e. the ones that I haven't deleted).\n\n*Retaining those conversations in the Messages app.\n\n*Not jailbreaking my device.\n\n\nUpdate: Apparently at least one person was confused as to what I'm asking, so hopefully this will clear it up: I have 3 (for example) conversations in Messages that I want to keep (history, attachments, and all). Those 3 take up around 100 MB of space on my iPhone. However, when I go into my iPhone's usage page, I see that Messages takes up 2 GB of space! I'm running low on disk space, so I want to get back 1.9 GB of space (2 GB - 100 MB). I tried deleting every conversation in Messages except those 3 that I want to keep. I then restarted and examined the usage again, and Messages still reports as taking up nearly 2 GB of space! The only explanation is that there is \"dead space\" on my phone: space that my iPhone is consuming for things I can't even see. How can I free up this dead space? I can't use the solutions from the linked MacRumors threads because they either (1) delete all conversations from the Messages app--remember, I want to keep 3 conversations; or (2) involve exporting the messages to a different app/pdf--I want to have access to my conversation history in the native Messages app.\nFor reference, the solutions from the MacRumors threads seem to fall into these categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup to iTunes, delete all messages/attachments from the backup (e.g. via iBackupBot), restore using this backup. -- This wouldn't work since it violates constraint #1... I want to retain some of my conversations.\n\n*Using an app such as iMobie PhoneClean -- First, the user never mentions that dead space will be cleared up, next no one confirms that this resolved their issue, and finally the website makes the product look shoddy at best.\n\n*Exporting the messages to another app -- Violates #2.\n\n*Jailbreak the device and delete all attachments -- Violates #1 & #3.\n\n*Erasing all Content and Settings w/o a restore -- Violates #1\n\n*Restore using iTunes, then restore through iCloud (1, 2) -- I have tried the regular restore through iCloud, but not this method yet. It looks the most promising. Has anyone had any success with this?\n\n\nA: There may be a \"bug\" in IOS that hangs onto old messages or attachments even after a message or thread is deleted. The discussions you link to on macrumors.com seems to indicate that.\nThat said, if I have a lot of space being taken up for no apparent reason I find the best way to fix it is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your phone, Apps and all to your computer (encrypt the backup, it makes restoring easier)\n\n*On your iPhone fo to Settings > general > reset and tap on erase all contents and settings\n\n*Once the phone has been wiped, restore it using the backup you just made.\n\n\nNo guarantees that this will do the trick but it has successfully worked for other apps for me in the past. It would be interesting to know if it fixed the issue for you as well.\n", "Q: Can't send using Mail.

Whenever an application attempts to use, or even check to see if Java is installed, a pop-up is generated that steals focus and tells you all about how to install the latest JDK. This is perhaps useful the first time, but when it repeatedly happens for things that just check to see if java is available, it's a huge annoyance.\n(e.g. compiling various code from source, they often check for java among many other tests, to decide whether to build-in certain features at compile-time)\nSo what I'm after is a sensible way to disable the pop-up entirely.

This causes the CPU to be overclocked to boost the performance of a single core (or even a few cores). This causes increased current and power consumption, and of course heat.\nThe heat can be avoided by dividing the same load to separate cores (but Genymotion doesn't support this) or by disabling Turbo Boost (for example, Turbo Boost Switcher, not personally tested).\n\nA: Actually CPU usage over 100% is not uncommon. It just means it is using all of one proc. and 3% of another one. So that app is hungry for CPU.\nWhat you have done is narrow down the culprit to \"genymotion.\" Which is a good thing and might best be taken up with the folks who write that software.

But on the other side, they need their icon on the desktop to access the share.\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server: OS X 10.8.5, Server.app (2.2.5) \n\n*Clients: MBP, with OS X 10.10.4, network access via wired and wireless (if plugged in, wire is preferred to wifi)\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to mount a network share lazily (i.e. providing the icon on the desktop and attempt to mount it, if it is needed/accessed)?\n\n\n…or…\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it at least possible to fail silently?\n\n\nAny hints are appreciated, but out of the box solutions are preferred to hacking via scripts.\n\nA: autofs and automount\nConsider using autofs directly to handle the lazy mounting and unmounting of network drives. The automount manual page explains more.\nApple published Autofs: Automatically\nMounting Network File\nShares in Mac OS X to help administrators set autofs up.\nautofs has the benefit of being silent to the user and connects on-demand, instead of at login.\nI published setup-autofs to help a customer set up an autofs based connection between their Mac and a Windows shared drive. Once set up, the autofs approach has been resilient.\n\nA: In order to automate the network mounting of a specific volume on your system, you will need to follow the procedure bellow: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the desired Network drive on your system\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Navigate to Users & Groups\n\n*[optional]Unlock the session by the 'lock' button on the bottom left corner\n\n*Click on the Login Items tab\n\n*Click the \"+\" button, select the desired volume and press the \"Add\" button. \n\n", "Q: How to change the keymap of a Bluetooth keyboard of iPad?

When was the last time it wasn't having the kernel panic? What has changed on the system since then? \nUsually some new piece of software has been downloaded and installed (wittingly or un-wittingly, or perhaps by someone else using the machine, without your knowledge), or some new peripheral has been connected to the computer, or some new client/server relationship has been established.\nSo ask yourself: \"What has changed?\".\nThe next step is to systematically un-install and remove the new thing or things and see if this corrects the problem.\n", "Q: Confirm Unmounting/Ejection of Drive During Shutdown in Logs for Yosemite 10.10.4 I shut down my laptop today on my way out of the house, which had a drive connected via USB.

I don't  really know a ton about macs...I'm newly switched from a life of windows pc's.  I keep reading about how you can unintall and then reinstall your OS. I can't get my head around how you would do this, bc w/windows you would have no way to get on the internet to access the program without an OS on the computer. I can imagine getting a drive to put it on, from which you could reinstall, but that seems to defeat the point if you think your version could be corrupt and want to ditch it and get a clean copy. \nMy computer is the Macbook(not an air or pro), so it has no drives and only one port. I do not have any external drives.\nWhen I bought this machine I asked the genius bar to transfer my files, music and photos only. They  ended up transferring my entire drive, which included windows folders.I've deleted most of this, but am not sure if I've removed everything and do not know if this could be the source of the problem. Could these files have corrupted anything?\nAny thoughts greatly appreciated. Sorry if I appear ignorant! It's only bc I am when it comes to this :~)\n\nA: First off, congratulations on upgrading to a Mac, I'm a Windows \"switcher\", too, and will never go back. Secondly, as far as reinstalling a fresh copy of OS X (pronounced oh-es-ten NOT oh-es-ex) you will want to turn your MacBook off, then turn it back on, but while holding the Option key. Release it when you see two icons of hard drives, whatever you named your startup disk (\"Macintosh HD\" by default) and one labeled Recovery. Select Recovery by highlighting it with the arrow keys, and then hitting the enter key. Once there, you should see the option to \"Reinstall OS X\" select it and just follow the on-screen instructions from there. Make sure to select your start up disk, again named \"Macintosh HD\" by default, where it asks which drive to reinstall it on.\n", "Q: Why does Powerpoint for Mac not preserve filenames with a slash (/)?

Since my Yahoo account has all my emails since forever saved into folders that are helpful for me to keep organized, I have set up my Gmail to forward all emails Gmail receives to my Yahoo account, so that I can continue to use the Yahoo system while giving people my new Gmail address.\nSo, in my Mail app I use Yahoo. But I would like the emails that I send to appear as being sent from my Gmail address. \nI have tried adding the Gmail account and then setting Gmail as the default account. That didn't work. I have also tried clicking on Yahoo in the settings and then going to the outgoing server setting and entering in smtp.gmail.com. That didn't work either. I also tried deleting my Yahoo account and re-adding it, in case the order that the accounts were added had anything to do with it. \nAny advice on how I can continue to use Yahoo to organize my emails, but have them send AUTOMATICALLY from my Gmail address?\nThank you very much! :) \n\nA: If you want all email send from one account (i.e. gmail) you can set that up in Mail preferences.\nOpen Mail Preferences then select Composing:\n\nNow select your gmail in the \"send new messages from:\"\nObviously in Mail you will need Yahoo and Gmail accounts.\nAlternatively you can use the \"Reply to\" in Mail app.\nFor that Start a new mail and go View - \"Reply to Address Field\" or simply use shortcut alt+cmd+R. Then enter your reply to address. Now when you send new emails or you reply to emails it will use the selected email.\n\nThe third option: if you are really serious with that, you can use the Terminal app located in your Utility folder.\nType \"defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Reply-To\" = \"reply-to@address\"; }'\" (excluding the outermost quotation marks) and replace reply-to@address with the address you want to be used for replies.\nRead more here\n", "Q: iPhone 5s takes blurry photos only in apps that access camera My iPhone 5s takes perfectly clear photos when I access and use the stock Camera app to take a photo. However, if I try to use the camera in an app, e.g. to use the camera in my banking app to deposit a check, the photo is too blurry to use. I have found this is the case with all apps that use camera other then the Camera app.\n\nA: Sometimes, even when we have tried \"everything,\" a reset of the device can help.  This 'reboots' the phone.\nHard Reset\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Home and Power buttons down at the same time until the  logo comes back to the screen. (The screen will go black, keep holding.)\n\n*Let go of BOTH buttons when the logo comes back.  (Continuing to hold the Home button will put the iOS device into Recovery Mode)\nRecovery mode will re-download iOS and then give you the option of restoring from a backup.\nIf this doesn't work, and a restoration of the phone from scratch in Recovery Mode (which is time consuming for the download) doesn't work, if you iPhone is under warranty see if Apple will be able to help.  They want you to be happy and will do what they can within reason.\nFrom a thread in Apple support community:\n\nSoft = Turn phone off and on.\n  Hard = BOTH buttons held until you see Apple Logo.\nDifference: I like to explain by thinking of a laptop. On a laptop (or\n  even computer) you can go to hibernation mode (memory gets written to\n  disk then powers down). When turned on, it loads back up from memory\n  and thus everything that was loaded in memory before shutting down is\n  put back. That is what a Soft reset is (when you do the power button\n  the slide to turn off). Thus if there was a memory leak for example in\n  some program causing issues (sluggish, crashes, etc)....then if you\n  just turn off and on, it will still have issues. A hard reset is like\n  pulling the plug on your computer. It will have to turn back on and\n  reboot fully. It does write an error log out to itself (nothing you\n  see) but causes no harm to your phone or data. It is just a way to do\n  a full clean boot up. This actually fixes about 90% of the issues most\n  people have.\nHas no effect on battery outside of the fact it has to boot up thus\n  processor and read writes will be happening.\n\n\nA: Have you tried going a DFU restore of the phone and setting up as new this should sort it. \n", "Q: Apache 403 when accessing via IP I'm running a web server on Yosemite but have run into a bit of an issue.

Instead of opening as usual, it does this bizarre slow animated slide-open into a fully black background with a password prompt stating that I've been logged out of iCloud and need to reconnect. See below \n\nFrom here, if I try to enter my password, nothing! It won't let me type anything in the field; it will not allow me to cancel; it will not allow me to close without a force quit  as the black screen does not have the normal red close button on top left. I have force quit 3x and tried to start over to no avail. I have done a restart and a hard reboot. Nothing has worked.I just want to play some music. Has anyone seen this? If so, please let me know and if there is something I can do to stop this and open iTunes.\nBy way of other info:keyboard registering characters everywhere else. It says that my iCloud session has expired, which is why it wants my password, but it hasn't. I went to iCloud through settings and I am logged on. So, while I may have been logged out of iTunes, I am not logged out of iCloud as this states. Lastly, this is a new Macbook; only a month old. I recently signed up for Apple music, but that was 2 weeks ago and has worked fine, so while this may be culprit, it's not been a problem until just now. Just tried getting on iTunes on my phone and i'm on no problem.\nWondering if this could be a virus. Note,the \n\"expired session\"  message referring to iCloud being logged out does not make since. First off, I am logged in to iCloud Music is not even an affected app as iTunes controls Music.\nUgh!\n\nA: I'm afraid I've got the same problem.\nI restarted the Imac yesterday. The close down took more than 3 minutes. This happend before. I forced the closing down by pressing the power button. After normal start up I could not start iTunes anymore. All other apps function properly. The desktop shifts left and a black screen appears. I can operate the dock and other programms though. I can only get out by forced stop of iTunes.\nIf I attach my iPhone and start iTunes, a screen prompting me to update it appears (on top of the desktop). I cannot operate it however, as it it is complete dead!\nI also tried other option as close full screen, launchpad, ect.\nStrange thing is that this occurred about the samen time as my wife synced an iPad which belonged to me before. She was asked to enter ID's of which one was my ID related to buys I suppose. \nI checked my iCloud account. It is still active.\nPS!!\nI just cracked it! I moved (not copied!) the itunes library to a temp folder.\nI restarted iTunes and it immediately came up with the familiar screen. Probably a new library was created. I then imported the info from the temp folder (trough the menu). The new library was updated. I could notice by syncing the iPhone. Also my music is back and available.\n\nA: After a frustrating day I decided to contact AppleCare. The tech had never heard of this issue. We attempted myriad fixes booted up in safe mode, PRAM reset, and a variety of other things to no avail. Finally, they had me reinstall the OS X and it appears to have fixed the issue. Not ideal to have to do such a drastic fix on a 2 month old laptop...but there it is. I'm assuming this will also resolve the other issues i've been having with Mail and Safari (separate inquiry), but only time will tell.  Advised that if this occurs again it will almost certainly be hardware related.\n", "Q: Unable to find in App Store, able to redownload using iCloud?

In the App Store app on your iPod, if you go to the Updates tab and you scroll up a little bit there is an option to see all your purchased apps. You can then tap \"Not on This iPod\" to find all the apps you've downloaded that aren't on that iPod, and it should be easy to find there.\n", "Q: Is there any possibility to find my father's lost iPhone? My father has lost his iPhone 6 which was not signed in using an iCloud account.

How can I fix it. I have only had this computer a month and it was working before.\n\nA: is there anything specific you can tell us about this problem?\nFor example, when you click 'about this mac' does the tab flash, confirming that you have in fact clicked it? and if so are you merely receiving a \"rainbow spinning wheel of death\" issue?\nEither way, I have done some research into this and it appears that you are not alone in this problem. Most people have suggested simply bypassing the problem by launching the \"System Information\" application found under the \"Utilities\" folder inside \"Applications\", which will give you a far more in-depth insight into your mac than the \"about this mac\" tab ever will. However this is an unusual problem which should not be placated simply by bypassing it.\nTo solve this problem  i would suggest a few things, firstly: what was the last thing that you did before this error appeared, it could involve installing something odd or an unusual system crash (which may not have been your fault). If it was something unusual than it may be related to the error and could solve it through its reversal (if at all possible).\nThe second is to try and repair your disk permissions, by entering the Disk Utility application (Applications/Utilities folder again), and clicking verify and finally repair, which may well solve the problem. After this, i suggest a complete restart of the computer.\n**\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggestion source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2686259\n**\nIf worse comes to worst, you can always completely reset the machine, however this is somewhat overkill for such a minor issue.\nHope that this helps.\n", "Q: Application works when OS X was updated but not on a clean install I'm trying to get FileMaker Pro 9 to work on Os X 10.10 (unsupported). Having installed a fresh copy of FileMaker on a new Mac I get an error stating that 'some required files are damaged or not installed'. \nHowever, when I updated another Mac from 10.7 to 10.10 with Filemaker already installed, it continues to work without problems. \nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to find out what files are missing on the new machine? They've got to be system or preference files as the application folder is excactly the same. \n\nA: Filemaker versions prior to 12 may or may not work well on OS 10.10.x\nFrom Filemaker Support:\n\nFileMaker 12 and earlier versions of FileMaker have not been tested or\n  certified with OS X Yosemite (10.10).  These products were developed\n  and released before OS X Yosemite became available.\nWhile these earlier versions may install and run on OS X Yosemite\n  (10.10), you may encounter installation and stability issues for which\n  there is no resolution. (Italics added)\n\nAlthough you may get older versions (Version 9 was released back in OS X 10.5 days) to work on newer systems, it is hit and miss.  You could try a fresh install again of FileMaker to see if you can get it to 'stick.'  Be careful to keep a backup of your data.  I can imagine if you are still using FM 9 that you have a great deal of important data that has accumulated in your solution over the years.\nAs for the exact missing files between your installs, that would require a deep look at both installations and compare every tiny little file in the system.  Excruciatingly painful.  It is impossible to determine without access to the system in question.\nThe files to check are System files in the ~/Library/Application Support/FileMaker and possibly other places.\nThere are several professional developers who can assist you with migrating your solution to a newer version. (current is FileMaker 14)  This is expensive, but if your business relies on data and downtime is critical, this is a small price to pay.  Converting a file from .fm7 to .fm12 is not trivial, but it is not very difficult for a seasoned developer. (Not assuming your development skill level here.)  This would probably be best as it will prolong the life of your solution.

What's the easiest way to get a single photo from my phone to my Mac without sending a message to someone?\n\nA: Open Image Capture or the Photos app on the Mac and connect the phone over USB. That's the easiest way to pick one photo to import.\nOther methods involve setting up sync or some apps to do the syncing if AirDrop is not reliable enough for your needs. (you're not alone there on depending on it - wireless interference that can be reasonable encountered these days can render AirDrop less than reliable in my experience)\n", "Q: Terminal: grep command usage with '[' character as target, not function Im using the grep command In a simple script, the problem however Is that the string which the grep command Is searching for includes a square bracket character: [.\nAfter some research, i have found that the square bracket [ character is in fact used as a function for optimising the grep commands output through a process called \"pipelining\" (Although don't quote me on It as Im not sure).\nMy Question:\nHow do I search for a string with a '[' character in it without invoking a pipelining function within grep?\nElaboration:\nThe script Is searching a system log for the string su[.

I only keep a small set of music on my phone of my otherwise large iTunes purchase history, and consequently if I picked a random album or song out of my music app there is a high likelihood that it has to be downloaded.  In the past there have been settings that I could configure to only show downloaded music, but with the latest update I can't find anything that works.  Any help?  Here is the closest thing I could find:\n\nHowever even with it off I still see this:\n\n\nA: The easiest way I've found to do this is in the iPhone iTunes app click on the \"my music\" button, then it will say Artist in red and there's a red down pointing arrow next to it. If you click that, there is a drop down to turn on \" Only Downloaded Music\". Turn that button to green and the music that isn't downloaded will disappear. Hope this helps.\n\nA: You're quite right; an \"offline\" mode would help make Apple Music just a little bit better! However -- as you found out yourself -- nothing like that is baked into iOS.\nHowever, there is a workaround: create a smart playlist in iTunes instead. This method assumes that you have a computer with iTunes installed, that both your computer and iDevice are linked to Apple Music, and that you're connected to the internet on both devices.\nTo get started, open iTunes on your PC or Mac, click Playlists,\n\nclick the small plus sign in the lower left-hand side of the screen,\n\nand click New smart playlist....\n\nIn the new window that pops up, click the drop-down menu that currently shows Artist,\n\nselect Location,\n\nand simply use the default settings as shown.\n\nFrom there, your iDevice should automatically sync with your new playlist. What's great is that the playlist only shows which songs you currently have downloaded to a particular device.\nI hope this helps, and feel free to ask away if you don't understand something or run into any issues!\n", "Q: PDF reader that allows user to alternate between reading on PC and on Mac I have to read a lot of PDF files and am wondering whether there is an app out there that allows me to alternate between reading on Windows PC and on Macbook Air.

So it's safe to purchase 6TB model of WD black or red. WD green probably same, but i don't know since i don't have that drive.\n\nA: I have an Early 2008 Mac Pro and new 8TB drives like the one shown in the photo at the top of this page. The two mounting holes closest to the drive's SATA connector fit the sled just fine. The other two, not so much. What to do?\nMany years ago, I discovered that the best way to fix something was not to try to duplicate the manufacturer's approach but to come up with a new one based on the tools and materials at hand. So, this is how I cheaply, easily, and securely mounted these drives:  \nWith the sled detached from the drive, remove the two mounting screws and grommets that don't match the drive's mounting holes. The easiest way to do that is to push down on the threaded ends of the screws with the blade of a flat-head screwdriver. That opens two relatively-large grommet holes on the sled.\nAs a substitute for the thickness and cushioning of the grommets, stick a small piece of similarly-thick tape or, using two-faced tape, other resilient material beside each of the grommet holes, on the side of the holes farthest from the usable mounting screws.\nNext, screw the sled to the drive with the two usable mounting screws, making a solid but somewhat floppy connection.\nTo eliminate the flop, go to your local grocery store and buy some lettuce or other greens that are bundled with a long (about 20\"), sturdy, plastic-covered-wire twist tie (alternatively, but potentially not as strong, a single strand of Ethernet wire).\nShape the twist tie into a \"U\" approximately the width of the drive.\nHold the drive in one hand with the sled-side up and the open end of the sled facing away from you. With your other hand, thread one end of the twist tie beside the drive, into the adjacent grommet hole, and back down beside the drive. Do the same with the other end of the twist tie on the other side of the drive.\nShape the twist tie tight around the sides and bottom of the drive and pull it tight against the cushioning material on the sled. Tie the ends of the twist tie tightly together on the wide, bottom of the drive with a single, full twist. Wind the ends of the twist tie securely under the resulting loop. Trim off the excess.\nTying the twist tie makes a \"knot\" that can be too big to fit between the bottom of Drive 1 and the top of the fan housing below it. For Drive 1, place the \"knot\" on what will be the bottom-left corner of the drive when mounted in the computer, so the \"knot\" fits in the space created by the curved corner of the fan housing.\nI tried tying a drive to a sled with other materials and configurations, but none of them worked. Particularly, anything placed on the inside edges of the sled \"runners\" blocks the sled from sliding onto its mounting bracket.\nIf necessary to reinstall the removed screws and grommets, wrangle the screws out of the grommets. Ease the grommets into the grommet holes, then push/thread the screws into the grommets.\nHappy Early 2008 Mac Pro computing!\n\nA: WD Blue 6TB drives have the original placement of holes and mount easily in Macpro sleds.\n", "Q: How can I transfer or link my Clash of Clans account to an Android device, from iOS? How do I retrieve my Game Center username and password from my iPhone to my Android, so I can restore the progress of my Clash of Clans app?\n\nA: You don't need your Game Center user and password —which in any case is usually your Apple ID and password; you can link devices in-game.\nFrom the Supercell support site, specifically \"Transferring your game to another device\":\n\niOS > Android or Vice Versa\nFirst, make sure the game is installed on both devices, keeping them both on-hand.

It monitors my emails, Facebook, changes my passwords, etc. I did a complete reset at an Apple Store, it is still there. The Apple tech support told me I would have to go back to the company to have it removed? My wife works there, and it will create problems for her. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Apple allows end users to remove any MDM profiles that could be seen as Malware if you didn't agree to enroll the device in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple ensures pretty well that a company cannot push these settings to any device except ones they strictly own.\n\n*If you enroll a BYOD iPad into their MDM - you are prompted to agree to enroll the device and you can inspect what sort of data collection and control you are yielding to the company.\n\n*At any time, you can remove the restrictions/monitoring - but you will then lose the Apps that are provisioned from the company, company data that is stored in company apps as well as loss of email accounts. This removal is surgical - only the items that \"belong\" to the company get deleted - all content remains unless it came in after the profile and under the profile's control.\n\n*If you don't trust the surgical remove option - power off the device and restore it from iTunes.\n\n\nI wouldn't call any of this malware since it was designed in by Apple and intended to be used in the way it is used. Hopefully you weren't surprised by what you agreed to when you enrolled the device or handed it over to IT. If you received it from IT - you may have missed all the prompts.\nBest of luck - and you'll know to carefully inspect all profiles going forward so you've comfortable with the control you cede to anyone else running a MDM.\n\nA: Mobile Device Management software can be installed by a company and is often part of an arrangement to allow work-related information on the device (such as work email or applications). They are specifically designed to prevent someone to remove the policy - once the device comes back online, typically the policy will reattach itself and/or you will receive incessant warnings about the policy having been removed which can kill a device should the company configure it that way. \nIn short, you will need to contact the company to have them remove the profile from the device (they should be able to do this from their end). Otherwise, you will have to get another device or lose access to the functions that made the policy required in the first place.\n", "Q: How do I make Outlook download images automatically/by default Outlook currently puts a banner at the top of my emails asking me for permission to download images.\nHow do I make it download this automatically and not ask me?\n\nA: Outlook Mail Settings\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Preferences... ⌘+, in Outlook\n\n*Select Reading under Email\n\n*The Security settings allow you change \"Automatically download pictures from the Internet:\"\n\n\n*\n\n*In all messages\n\n*In messages from my contacts\n\n*Never\n\n\n\nThe default is never, that is why the 'banner' appears.

My goal is to include in a zip file what amounts to a shortcut, instead of telling my customer(s) to open up Terminal and run a shell script.\nMy deployable essentially looks like this:\n$ unzip Deliverable.zip \n$ cd Deliverable; ls\napp.jar run.sh\n\nScript in run.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\njava -jar app.jar\n\nThere's a lot more in the directory; suffice to say I need to run the script from the directory Deliverable since I need to access paths relative to it.  However, I can't guarantee where a customer is going to open Deliverable.zip (could be home directory, could be right in the Downloads directory, etc.)\nI found this that describes how to create a new workflow in Automator, then save it as an application to launch a shell script.  I tried to do that to wrap run.sh but it says it can't find run.sh.\nSomebody suggested I use applescript and also sent me a link to how to use applescript to switch into the current directory; there's an applescript \"action\" in automator; so I made a new workflow with that, and saved it as an application.  This is what that looks like:\n\nThe code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set current_path to container of (path to me) as alias\n    end tell\n\n    do shell script \"java -jar app.jar\" \n\n    return input\nend run\n\nAnd this is the error I get when I run it:\n\nC'mon, this should be pretty simple.  What I am doing wrong here?\n\nA: I can see a couple of things wrong there.\nFirstly you have opened a workflow and not an Application.\nYou should choose Application when you make your selection for the type of Automator file.\n\nAnd the code you have will not work as you expect, since you have not changed directory. (cd).\nIn the code as you have it, all it is doing is getting the path as an alias and storing it in the variable  current_path and in a format unsuitable for the unix commands.\nBut you do not use it.\nSo the current directory will most likely be your home folder\nAt this stage there is no telling what it is trying to launch.\nIf I run it as you have it I get.\n\nWhich makes sense since I do not have Java installed. But if I did I would not expect it to find the right file.\nThe Applescript need to look like this.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set current_path to container of (path to me) as alias\n    end tell\n\n    do shell script \"cd \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of current_path) & \" ;ls | open -fe\"\n\n    return input\nend run \n\nIn my example\ndo shell script \"cd \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of current_path) & \" ;/bin/ls | /usr/bin/open -fe\"\n\nI cd to the POSIX path of the alias in the  variable  current_path \ni.e from \"alias \"Macintosh HD:Applications:\"\"   to  \"/Applications/\"\nThe quoted form of  escapes the path using quotes.\nI have used the /bin/ls command and pipe it to the open in TextEdit stdin as a demonstration here so that you can test to see if you are getting to the area you expect.\nYou would use something like;\ndo shell script \"cd \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of current_path) & \" ;\\\"java -jar app.jar\\\"\"\n\n\nupdate:\nA another way is just use pure Applescript.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set current_path to container of (path to me)\n\n        set theFile to (current_path) as alias\n\n        open file \"java -jar app.jar\" of theFile\n    end tell\n\n\nend run\n\n\nA: Path to Script\nIn your AppleScript, you need to change the current working directory (cwd) before issuing the java command. Do this with an AppleScript line like:\ndo shell script \"cd \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of file_path) & \" && java -jar app.jar\"\n\nThe && is important. If the cd succeeds, the java command will be launched within the right cwd. If cd fails, the java command will not be run.\nProblems you will likely encounter include:\n\n\n*\n\n*escaping the POSIX path passed to cd; users will have oddly named folders and spaces in their paths.\n\n*the cd may fail; wrap up your AppleScript in a try block to catch some errors and warn the user.\n\n\nperl\nPersonally, I would wrap use a short perl script in place of a bash script.\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse FindBin qw($Bin); # $Bin is a path to the script's parent folder\n\n`cd \"$Bin\" && java -jar app.jar`;\n\nThere are much better ways to write this perl snippet but this should work.\nAutomator Application\nThe best approach is to work through the problems with your Automator approach. @markhunte's answer discusses how to fix the path and create an application. This should get you most of the way.\nAlso see AppleScript path relative to script location.\nappify — create the simplest possible Mac app from a shell script\nAlternatively, you can use Thomas Aylott's appify script to bundle your shell script into an OS X application.

The restore process can take some time. What happens if someone sends me a message during this time that my phone is unusable? Will I be able to see the message at the end of the whole process? \nIt's my understanding that when you restore your phone, your number will no longer be associated with iMessages until you reenable iMessages. What will happen if someone tries sending a text?\nIf I have the Messages set up with iMessages enabled on another device (e.g. MacBook), would I receive the messages there?\n\nA: In my experience, when I send a user an iMessage while that user is unable to receive one, my iPhone (or whatever device as long as it is sending through my phone) will switch to SMS. When the message is sent as an SMS it will still arrive even after the recipient is re-connected. \nNote: I haven't looked through docs - this is just what I have come to through observation.\n\nA: \nWhat happens if someone sends me a message during this time that my phone is unusable? Will I be able to see the message at the end of the whole process?\n\nAs apparent in your case, you are already registered with iMessage. You will eventually receive the iMessage after you are done setting up your iPhone. The iMessage is kept on hold on the Apple's servers. Same is the case with SMS, only difference being that your cellular service carrier is holding the SMS instead of Apple.\n\nIt's my understanding that when you restore your phone, your number will no longer be associated with iMessages until you reenable iMessages.\n\nYour number isn't automatically deregistered with iMessage. Just that any pending messages will arrive once iMessage is active again.\nOn the sending party's end, an iMessage is sent as an SMS if sending iMessage fails (usually due to unavailability of Internet connection on the senders device), and the sender has enabled a Messages app setting called Send as SMS.\n", "Q: No longer an option to upload to iCloud with iTunes Match and iTunes 12.2.2? I've been trying out the new Apple Music service and saw some odd behaviors, so decided I should update my iTunes to 12.2.2 (I think I was on 12.0 or 12.1 previously).  Since the update, there is no longer any way that I can see, to add a track (one that I added to the library manually, for example) to the iCloud library.\nWhere did this feature go?  We used to be able to just right click the track and Add to iCloud Music Library, but no longer.  Also almost all of my tracks no longer have any indication of an iCloud Status, and of those that do - many are inexplicably not present in my local library and indicate that they need to be downloaded.  \nWhat gives here?  I haven't been able to find anything on these specific issues in my searches.  Is there some known problem here or am I just not understanding how iCloud music works now?  In fact I can't even find any evidence of iTunes Match existing any longer in iTunes.  No menu items, no preferences, etc.\nTo be clear, this has nothing at all to do with iOS and is concerned strictly with iTunes on OS X (Mavericks in my case).\nEDIT:  To add to this, I just noticed that only a few of my tracks still have the \"Add to iCloud Music Library\" option - specifically those tracks which are marked as duplicates.  Not a single other track in my entire library of 15,421 tracks, has that option anymore despite being an iTunes Match subscriber.  Can anyone shed some light on this?\nEDIT 2:\nOK, after a bit more investigation I think it may just be that the way iTunes handles iCloud music has changed with the introduction of Apple Music.  According to this apple KB article, it sounds like your entire library is now automatically uploaded and matched.  But what still confuses me is that there is absolutely no possible way Apple could have matched all of my music - because some of it is original work created by myself that exists nowhere else.  And those tracks - and many others - are also still missing the Add to iCloud Music Library option.  Are they added anyway but there is simply no longer any indication in iTunes of this fact?  If I attempt to delete one of these tracks, I'm given the option to Remove Download, so presumably they are indeed already in the cloud (and were before I upgraded iTunes, so that is in fact what I expect).  Maybe the real question here is:  Why does iTunes no longer display an indicator for tracks that have been uploaded to the cloud?\n\nA: I have just experienced the same thing and found that it looks like iTunes Match might have just been renamed and the settings moved.\nNote for future readers, I am using iTunes version 12.2.2.25 (64 bit) on Windows 10.\nMake sure you are logged in to the iTunes Store and also make sure your computer is authorized (see the Store menu item), and then try going to File > Library > Update iCloud Music Library. After selecting that menu item, look in the top right corner (where you would normally see anything downloading) and you should see this:\n\nAfter waiting for this to finish, my entire iTunes Match library appeared back! (This took about 10 minutes or so).\nAlso, to answer your question about the display indicator, as far as I can tell this behaves exactly as iTunes Match did for me previously. I can see which songs are downloaded, and I can choose to download those that haven't by clicking the cloud symbol.\n\nA: Open iTunes, go to iTunes > Preference > General, and check iCloud Music Library > click OK.\n", "Q: How can I retrieve picture files from the Photos App on Mac OS X (Yosemite)? What I am trying to do without success is to find a way to get the files of my photos (edited and original) in their best quality.\nSo, let me give a heads up first.\nI have a DSLR camera and during this time I've imported my pictures to the Mac in two different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*automatically, through the Photos App, after plugging the memory card, or\n\n*by reading the memory card and saving the pictures to a directory of my own choice.\n\n\nMy problem started when I decided to add my photos to Google Photos (with the best quality available). I stumbled into this problem:\nWhen I try either using the share button inside the App (which is not really an option), or to copy the pictures from the App to a directory (Desktop, for example), the pictures I get are not the best quality ones (a full size picture from my camera ranges from 6 to 14 MB each and the shared/copied versions are around 3 or 4 MB).\nTherefore, I tried other approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*to go to the Package Content of the Photos App (Finder -> Pictures -> Photos Library -> (right click) -> Show Package Contents -> Masters -> then year/month/day/folder) until I get to the folder that holds the pictures, and\n\n*to go to the directory of my own choice (in case I have used the second import approach).\n\n\nAlright! I got the best original versions! Still needs the edited ones, though.\nHowever, these folders don't have the edited versions of the pictures, so the pictures that I have enhanced in any way will appear in their originals only.\nAnd that's where I got stuck. Up till now, I did not found any other folder (inside the Photos Library) which might contain the edited photos, nor did I find a way to override the originals with the edited versions.\nDoes anyone have a say on this?\nThank you for your time. I'm open to any clarification.\n[Bonus] I suppose this is to be considered a feature, not a bug, however, when deleting pictures that were imported through the App, they go to the \"App's trash can\" (File -> Show Recently Deleted) and once you've deleted them from there, they are gone for good. However, when the pictures were imported from outside the App, after deleting the pictures in the App, they do not go to the \"trash can\", they disappear from the Photos App, but stay in their original folders as if nothing had happened. (I'm still trying to figure out a way to get rid of them without having to compare the filenames one by one, but that's another story.)\n[Bonus Update] I just noticed that the pictures do go to the \"App's trash can\", but you have to delete them from the \"Photos\" view (I was doing that from an Album). However, this does not solve the problem, since the pictures are not removed from the imported folder, even after cleaning the trash can.\n\nA: When you choose to export from Photo (File>Export), choose TIFF, 16-bit and you should get a full quality, uncompressed, but edited image out of Photo. This is what the settings in the export dialog box will look like:\n\nThe reason you haven't found the folder with the edits are that image editing programs such as Photo or Adobe Lightroom perform non-destructive edits as an instruction set that sits in a database that references the original image. Basically your edits just create a recipe that the software then can use to create an output file. If you choose to print, it will give the instructions on how to render the edited image to the printer. The only time you will get an edited file is if you export to a file format such as JPEG or TIFF. \nTIFF gives you an uncompressed file, and by choosing 16 bits, the software is actually interpolating to add pixels to your photos as most digital camera sensors produce a 12 or 14 bit image. There isn't much of a point for more, as the human eye has a hard time distinguishing the available gradations of a 16-bit dynamic range.\nJPEG is a Lossy compression format, but for even a 5K iMac, if you go for the highest quality, largest file size, you will likely not be able to see a difference between the TIFF and the JPEG version of the file, and you will have a file that is probably 80% smaller, depending on the subject matter.\nYou also have the option of exporting the Unedited originals (Raw files) using this option as well. There is an option to export IPTC data as an XMP sidecar file.\n", "Q: Password prompt for email Is there a way to add a password prompt when opening email app on a mac?

If you really have to use a shared account then do it but create additional one just for your Mail app.\n\nA: slick is right. You would have to create another user account and switch to it to read mail if you have to use mail.app. \nIf you can use webmail with that account instead of the mail.app just don't let the browser save the password for your webmail login and you can securely get into your mail under the same account. heck you could even use a \"Private Window\" so no one else with access can read the cache or history.\n", "Q: Can I install Compass in Yosemite WITHOUT installing Xcode or Command Line Developer Tools? I'm trying to install several programming packages, but it turns out that I can't because I don't have Xcode or Command Line Developer Tools installed.\nSome (e.g. git) were easy to install anyway.\nBut for others (e.g. compass) I'm not finding any solution.\nBeing OS X an unix based OS, it should be straightforward to install packages.\nI know that the easy answer is install Command Line Developer Tools, but the problem is that I can't: I don't have access to a fast internet connection, and installing Command Line Developer Tools is practically impossible (I've been trying for some weeks, then I gave up). That's why I'm looking for an alternative.\n\nA: Compass\nCompass shouldn't require the Command Line Developer Tools, just a compatible ruby environment.\nI suggest a ruby version tool instead of using the system ruby, so that you can control your ruby version/environment. I favor chruby, but any of these works well and can be installed without needing the Command Line Dev Tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*chruby  \n\n*rbenv  \n\n*RVM\nOnce you have a ruby env with the version you want you should be able to install Compass from the command line (as detailed on the compass site):  \n$ gem install compass\n\nNote: the \"$\" isn't part of the command, just an indicator of the terminal prompt\nCommand Line Developer Tools\nWhile the above works for Compass, it sounds like you are asking about general package management with OS X as well. Homebrew is a very popular tool for this, but depends on the Command Line Dev Tools. MacPorts is an alternative but has the same dependency. I'm not aware of a package manager for OS X that doesn't depend on the Command Line Dev Tools.\nIn case you haven't tried one of these methods to install the tools I'm throwing them out there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download directly from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ (you need to login with Apple ID). The URLs provided there may be resumable if the download is interrupted, and may be more reliable than installing without Xcode via the terminal.\n\n*Install without Xcode via the terminal:\n$ xcode-select --install\n\nHaving the tools definitely makes things easier; I personally love Homebrew (and it's offspring Cask) for managing both CLI and GUI packages.\n", "Q: Synching without erasing songs on my iPhone I managed to lose all my songs in my iTunes Library and cannot recover them, meaning that my iTunes Library is completely empty. I still have the songs on my iPhone however. I know I will have to upload songs into iTunes eventually. For the time being, I would simply like to add a few new songs to my empty iTunes and then upload them to my iPhone, but without doing anything that will cause me to erase the songs that are already on the iPhone. Is there a way to ADD songs without erasing the songs on my iPhone? I just cannot figure out how to sync without erasing existing playlists and songs on the iPhone.\n\nA: I suspected that there was no way to get around it ...

Running Windows 8.1 on my 2013 Macbook Pro that runs OS X 10.10.5. \nWant to update the version of BootCamp (and related drivers) that it is running - I don't think it has updated since I partioned and installed Windows 3-6 months ago and I know there have been updates.\n\n\n*\n\n*I was notified within Windows via Windows Update of new BootCamp and tried the update via Windows update but it failed\n\n*Running Apple Software Update within Windows doesn't give me anything BootCamp related to download & install - this Apple Support Article  says that it will be available via this channel but it's not?\n\n*The options from within Yosemite + BootCamp all seem to entail a re-partition and reinstall of my entire Windows partition (naturally not first prize) \n\n*Download of drivers onto a USB stick from Apple website but this also seems to involve a re-partition.\nMy end goal is to perform the free upgrade to Windows 10 without reinstalling but I am trying to get BootCamp in order from the beginning.\nRelated question: how can I tell precisely which version of BootCamp I am actually running. From within Windows I can right click on About Boot Camp and it says 5.1 but this is not specific enough.\n\nA: Open BootCamp Assistant and open the about window. You should be similar to Version 5.1.4 (500) if you are on 10.10.5\nBootCamp gets updated when you update OS X so it's really not dependent upon any version of Windows whatsoever so you would be up date on BootCamp even if you deleted your windows partition and started over.\n\nA: As @bmike♦ said, BootCamp gets updated when you update OS X: indeed i'm running 10.11 and i've got Boot Camp Assistant version 6.\nNow, i did the same thing: i updated from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and i didn't need to update any drivers whatsoever.\nI had my Windows 8 installed with BootCamp Drivers (but i didn't had the whole partition thingy because I installed Windows on an external hard drive) and i was able to upgrade to Windows 10 without touching the drivers at all. It was really nice and straightforward, just like I was running a proper Windows PC.\n", "Q: How to enable vim X11 feature on OSX10.10? I want to use  set clipboard=\"unnamedplus\" in my vim, which requires X11 feature.\nBut I searched a bit on google.\nWhich only mentions that Apple has removed X11 from their recently releases of OSX.\nBut there is no tutorial about how to install it on OSX.\nEspecially no info about how to enable X11 feature in a vim on OSX.\nHow to do that?\n\nA: You are correct that Apple no longer provides X11 in OS X. They now recommend you download and install XQuartz instead. Recent versions of OS X will actually prompt you to install XQuartz when they detect you're trying to run an application that requires X11, but the detection isn't foolproof so sometimes you just have to install it manually.\nNot sure about your vim question specifically, but I would guess if you run vim in an xterm after you've installed XQuartz, any X11 features should work as intended.\n\nA: Have you considered completely bypassing X11 and using MacVIM instead? If the purpose is to have the VIM GUI instead of text mode in a terminal and have access to the Mac's clipboard, this is probably the better way to go. However, if you're looking to use the clipboard while remotely connecting to another UNIX box, that is a different story.\n", "Q: Can I get iPhone messages through my Mac? I am wondering if there is any way I can get my iPhone messages to come in through my messages on my Mac computer?\nMy iPhone is not working at the moment and has to get the battery replaced so it won't turn on.\n\nA: Messages.app on OS X can sync messages from iPhone your to the app. This only works when your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network. \nSo if your phone is getting repaired, you will only receive iMessages (messages sent font an iPhone/iPad/Mac to another iPhone/iPad/Mac), and not SMS texts.\n\nA: If you're referring to voice mail, the only way of retrieving them that I'm aware of is through your cellular provider. For example, Verizon has a way that you can dial in to your voice mail from another phone, but you'll have to refer to their documentation on how to specifically do that and might even require a call to customer service if you never set up a password.\niMessages, as pointed out in another answer, can be configured to work in your Mac's Messages.app program as long as they're both on iCloud with the same credentials. Normal SMS text messages, however, require your iPhone to be functional, connected to the cell network and on the same WiFi network as your Mac and both running the latest OSs: iOS 8.x and OSX 10.10.x. You would have had to set up both the mobile and the desktop to allow for text message forwarding and done the \"one time code validation\" routine.\n", "Q: See remaining credits of iTunes account on Apple TV Where can I check remaining credits of my iTunes account on my TV? I use Apple TV.\n\nA: It's currently not possible.​​\n", "Q: Multiple user accounts in Safari like in Chrome? \nNote: creating a separate system user is not an option for me.\n\nIn Google Chrome, I can create separate \"users\" and launch a new Chrome window. Tabs that are opened in this window have their own sessions (cookie jars) that I can keep separate from other user's sessions.\nThis is great for me because, as a developer, I have personal and work \"users\" with separate logins for many of the same services.\nE.g., I have a personal and a work gmail account - instead of combining them in gmail, I prefer to keep them separate. In my personal Chrome window, I login to gmail to read personal email. In my work Chrome window, I login to gmail (Google Apps for your domain) to read work email.\nAnother common one is digitalocean, github, and bitbucket. I have personal accounts for each, and work accounts for each. Keeping these things in separate Chrome windows is very helpful for me.\nAnother great thing about it is Chrome will save my tabs for me. When I'm at work, I can close my personal user window and open my work user window. All of my tabs from the last time I was working will be there. When I'm done with work, I open my personal user window and all my personal tabs are restored.\nThat said, Chrome is a bloated pig and hogs my RAM and battery. On a brand new Macbook Pro, with Chrome running, I'll get around 4 hours of battery life. With it closed, I can get much closer to 8 hours.\nI'd like to ditch Chrome and try Safari, but without such a user profile feature, I'm afraid it will not be useful for me. If it's not natively possible, is there a plugin/extension available?\nThanks for any information.\n\nA: Open another tab in private browsing. It lets me log into one tab with my own Facebook, and another tab as my wife's Facebook. \n\nA: I, too, have looked for this ability in Safari, but it just doesn't exist. I've submitted an enhancement request at Apple's Safari Feedback page every time a new version has come out.\n\nA: SwitchUp is no longer actively supported, unfortunately but I have a recommendation which I am using just now – \nhttps://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/\nRun a second safari :-) Technically, this would be beta software so you may run into issues, but it's the closest I can see to accomplishing this (and yes, you'd only be limited to 2 profiles with this).\nGood luck!\n\nA: Maybe SwitchUp is a solution for you. I'm using it for some time now and I like it.\nSwitchUp makes it easy to create separate profiles so you can use an application for both home and work with different accounts, settings and data. It's like a multi-user environment for every application.\nNot only for Safari but also for other apps :-) Although you can use it only for Safari...\n", "Q: Self-hosted Webinar service software I'm searching for self-hosted webinar software.

I recently reinstalled OS X, when it asked me to erase the disk I just left it Untitled, since there's no instruction to rename it to whatever on this Apple support page, after restoring with Time Machine the disk name became Untitled, same with the partitioned name, which I easily rename to Macintosh HD.\nHere are screenshots of the Untitled HD\n\n \nspecs: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) - 256GB\nAFAIR the original name has something to do with the capacity and SSD brand. Now I can't remember the original disk name and I don't know how to (safely) rename it, \nTo add up, I think my old disk is GUID, not LVG, did I do something wrong? How can I revert back everything to the default state, I'm quite anal about these things since it might results in problems in the future etc.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: The naming scheme for non-CoreStorage devices/volumes looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*(hard-coded) name of the disk device\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI (invisible in non-tweaked Disk Utility)\n\n*Volume 1 (usually Macintosh HD)\n\n*Volume 2 (optional)\n\n*...

(optional further volumes)\n\n*name of the Physical Volume (invisible)\n\n*Recovery HD (invisible)\n\n\n\nThe names of the Logical Volume Group and the Logical Volumes usually derive from former volume names or is just \"Untitled\" for Physical Volume(s) but the hard-coded physical device name is rarely used (I have seen it only once, probably the owner renamed it).\nRenaming the Logical Volume Group:\nTo rename the Logical Volume Group use:\ndiskutil cs rename lvgUUID|lvgName newName\n\nTo get the lvgUUID just enter diskutil cs list. It's the first UUID listed. Alternatively you may use the Logical Volume Name. I don't know whether this works if you have several equally named LVGs or PVs. Therefore I always prefer the UUID.\nTo get the previous visible disk device name open \"About your Mac\" -> System Report -> Hardware -> SATA/SATA Express and search for your device.\nReverting CoreStorage to non-CoreStorage:\nTo revert the CoreStorage non-destructively to a traditional non-CoreStorage volume boot to Recovery Mode/Internet Recovery Mode or an OS X thumb drive.\nOpen Termínal.app and enter:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nto get the Logical Volume UUID (usually it's the last listed) and enter:\ndiskutil cs revert lvUUID\n\nto convert your CoreStorage device to non-CoreStorage.\nThough the command converts CS to non-CS non-destructively it's always a good advice to have a current backup of your main volume.\nYou mustn't do this with Fusion drives or you will destroy all your data.\n", "Q: MBP 2013 becoming unresponsive to keyboard and mouse My machine is a 15\" Late 2013 MBP Retina. My OS is Yosemite 10.10.4.\nI have a recent issue where my machine is intermittently becoming unresponsive to the keyboard and mouse. It's happening on average about twice a day at the moment.\nI use a USB keyboard and mouse, plugged in via a USB hub. \nThe screen looks fine, the cursor is still flashing, I can plug the charger in/out and the battery symbol changes accordingly, the screensaver will come on fine, new email still comes in etc, so everything seems ok except my keyboard and mouse no longer work. \nIt also affects the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop itself. I press the caps lock key on the laptop keyboard and the green indicator doesn't come on.\nThe only key which works, luckily for me, is the power key on the laptop keyboard. I can hold that down and restart the machine. Nothing else works.\nI've tried plugging the keyboard and mouse in directly (albeit only after the issue has started happening), I've reset the PRAM, I've closed the machine for 5 minutes and come back, nothing seems to fix it other than a reboot. \nI've looked through the logs (after restarting) at the time it starts happening but nothing stands out.\nI only recently moved to a USB keyboard and mouse and this issue only started happening since then. I only started using the USB hub at the same time too. I also started putting the machine on an MStand (although I can't imagine that would affect anything).\nIf it's one of the USB devices (or hub) causing this then it seems odd to me that it would also affect the keyboard/trackpad on the actual machine.\nI've seen couple of other threads where people have something similar but nothing exactly the same and no definitive answers. Has anyone had a similar experience? Is there an obvious culprit out of the things I've changed recently which would cause the input devices to stop working? \nAny advice appreciated.\n\nSome more info: I'm pretty sure it's only happening when trying to do lots of scrolling with the mouse scroll wheel. I used to use the infinite scroll feature on the mouse a lot but noticed that's when the issue was occurring. So I switched to regular scrolling i.e. the clicky scroll wheel and it's happening much less frequently. It's happened once in the last 3 days whereas before it was at least once per day.\nFeels like some kind of driver issue but the logitech software is up to date (v3.9.1).\nStill hugely frustrating.\n\nA: I had a similar issue and I stopped having it by turning off bluetooth.\nI had no bluetooth device connected when the problem happened.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi connection timeouts on a specific MacBook Running OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and keep running into connection timeouts.

The reason I suspect this is a general problem is that I've struggled with it before with other apps, namely emacs itself and perhaps some other apps that have emacs keybinding emulation, but not sufficiently often (once a year or so) that I can remember the solution.  What I do remember is that the solution was really obscure and perhaps not something we had to do to the app directly, but to the environment or context. \nThe problem is that alt keys don't work as expected as modifier keys, but instead input glyphs. For example, we want Alt-D to perform the editor function \"Kill-to-end-of-word,\" but, instead, it inputs ∂; we want Alt-B to perform the editor function \"Move-caret-to-previous-word,\" but, instead, in inputs ∫.  Oddly, Alt-F works as expected to perform \"Move-caret-to-next-word\" instead of inputting ƒ.\nHere are some more details:\nMac OSX yosemite, PyCharm CE 4.5.3, emacs key bindings\n(command-, / Preferences; Keymap; Emacs)\nI check the key bindings on the right hand side, the spyglass-with-cannonball icon says \"Find Actions by Shortcut\" on hover, I click that, enter \"Alt-B\" and it finds \"Move Caret to Previous Word.\" However, when I go back to the editor window and press \"Alt-B\" I get ∫. Likewise, when I search keymap for Alt-D, I get \"Kill to End of Word\" (just what I want), but in the editor window, it prints as the curly derivative sign ∂. \n\nA: You need a replacement layout to allow M- key bindings.

As this is my first time dealing with HW of my Macbook Pro Early 2011 and need lot of money for service, I am quite nervous with this. \nI want to upgrade my Macbook Pro RAM to 8GB.

I just want to evade the possibility breaking my Macbook Pro.\n\nA: The RAM you listed there will work perfectly fine.\nWhenever buying RAM just make sure you have the correct type (DDR3 in your case) and the correct speed (1333 MHz or PC10666 in your case).\nIt won't 'break' your MacBook but instead it just won't boot if you have the incorrect type or speed of RAM in your MacBook. RAM has no saved state when turning your computer off so logically it couldn't harm your MacBook if you switch it out for incorrect RAM and then put the correct one back in.\nSo summarized: The RAM you listed will work but in the future always check for speed & type (I like to use MacTracker for this).\n\nA: It's very unlikely that bad RAM will \"break\" your MacBook.

I lost my iphone 5s today at the movie theater, and I'm pretty sure someone stole it... There's a passcode lock on my phone, and I have tried to enable lost mode on Find My Iphone, but the device is offline and the request is still pending. I have no hope that I will get my phone back, but will the phone go into lost mode if the phone is reset and someone connects to wifi? Or will my phone be automatically removed from my icloud account due to lost mode not enabled? Thanks!\n\nA: Lost mode does not remove either activation lock (good for you, bad for resale or thieves) nor wi-fi saved credentials or cellular data.\nThe finder can ensure the device never connects to a network but they also can't use it under those circumstances for anything but trying to brute force the passcode and read the data offline.\nIf they reset the device / iTunes will report that it's activation locked and until they connect to WiFi or get you to release it from your iCloud - they can't activate that device without Apple's help. The reset will wipe saved WiFi but not cellular data. If you discontinue service, you'll drastically reduce recovery location chances. But that costs $$ and the tradeoff is about a month or two for me currently.\nYou should keep it on your iCloud forever if you wish to keep it locked to your account.\nSorry for the loss - you are in the ideal situation to get it back and haven't sabotaged any of your options with lost mode.\n", "Q: How to selectively sync playlists from iCloud to iPhone I am using Apple Music and all my purchased songs & the playlists are synced to the cloud.

I am now looking into desktop solutions, and think my needs make a Mac Mini my best option. I haven't used Thunderbolt before, and am wondering if I can use Thunderbolt to connect my Macbook Pro to my Mac Mini, thus making my laptop files accessible from the Mini on my external display. If that is the case, in addition to purchasing a Mac Mini, will the only other piece of equipment I need to make this connection be a Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable?\n\nA: You can do that, but you'll have to use Target Disk Mode in order to get the Mac to recognize the other one as a hard drive.\n\nA: You don't need any cable to share files or share screens. Just turn on sharing in the preference pane.\nIf you wish to make the sharing speed faster, you could use a network between the two computers over thunderbolt.\nThe least desirable solution to me is target disk mode since one computer needs to be shut down entirely to enable that option.\n", "Q: Does Facebook's \"find friend\" algorithm get data from the iOS app?

When I use \"headset\" plugin (the one with 4 grooves on a jack and a mic on a cord) the volume slightly reduces after 1 or 2 seconds.\nCan someone explain this behaviour and tell me if it can be fixed?! \n\nA: Headphones volume level is separate from the built-in speaker output. For example you can set the speakers' volume to 0 before plugging in headphones and then adjusting the headphones' volume to something different. When the headphones cable is unplugged, the system goes back to the previous volume value.\nIf I remember correctly, recent Macs also have a impedance sensor in the headphone jack, so that you can have different volume levels for different headphones based on impedance.\n\nA: OS X remembers volume settings for each headphone.

It's all backed up. I'm reinstalling from the recovery partition currently. Before I started working on it today, it had the very descriptive problem: \"wouldn't boot.\"\nI previously had installed Ubuntu on this since she wanted to try it, and it was run as a dual boot system for about a year. Now, the disk space needs to be brought back into Mac, since the HDD was almost full. To top it off, Grub/rEFInd seem to have gotten lost at some point along the way during an upgrade, so Ubuntu is functionally gone anyway.\nI did some research, took it into safemode, which did boot, backed up, and then booted into recovery (command + r), opened up disk utility, formatted, and clicked the - button on the three Linux partitions (boot, swap, and file system, I believe).\nNow, when I look in Disk Utility, on my 320GB HDD I see a ~200GB Macintosh HD (which I have erased and formatted), a Recovery HD, and there's over 100GB missing. There's no other partitions, and I can't expand the Macintosh HD partition. \nImmediately after removing the partitions, I had a Partition Table error when I ran Verify on the HDD. Repair kept failing, so I rebooted into recovery mode and ran repair. Now there's no error, but still no drives.\nWhen click on the HDD and go to the Partition tab, I can choose 1 Partition, which does correctly show 320GB. Otherwise, I can't find the lost 100GB. I tried enabling debug mode (something like defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1) and checking making everything visible, but the partitions still are not visible.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to reinstall without the disks (not my machine, no idea where the disk is) if I change the drive to 1 partition and format it? Am I going to be able to do this from Recovery Tools?\n\n*Following Unable to increase partition size with subsequent blocking partition, I believe after reinstalling OSX I will be able to use a 3rd Party utility, probably gParted, to move stuff around on the drive. Can I use gParted from an Ubuntu live disk for this?\n\n*Is there a way to make the partitions reappear is disk utility so that I can at least format them?\n\n\n\nAfter reinstall finished:\nEdit: Per the comment, here's the output of sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  423215696      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  423625336    1269544      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  424894880    1269536      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  426164416  198977999         \n  625142415         32         Sec GPT table\n  625142447          1         Sec GPT header\n\nAnd a screenshot of DiskUtility's output.

The easiest procedure to solve your problem is to boot to Internet Recovery Mode and completely reformat the internal drive and reinstall OS X:\nAccording to this Apple support document your MacBook Pro (Mid 2010)* can be upgraded to use Internet Recovery after applying a firmware upgrade. Since the firmware upgrade was published in 2012 I assume that it was applied already.\nSo to answer the first part of your first question: After booting to Internet Recovery Mode you may install Mac OS X Lion. In Internet Recovery Mode usually the Mac OS X the Mac originally was shipped with will be installed. For Snow Leopard Macs like your MBP Mid 2010 Mac OS X Lion will be installed.\nTo initiate the Internet Recovery Mode restart your Mac and press alt cmd R.\nThe prerequisites for an Internet Recovery are listed here: Recovery/Internet Recovery.\nIn a few words you need the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated for a successful internet recovery.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into the Recovery Netboot image which is loaded from an Apple server.\nAfter booting successfully open Disk Utility and repartition your disk to 1 JHFS+ partition with a GUID partition table. Quit Disk Utility and start 'Reinstall OS X'. Depending on your internet connection the reinstall will take some time.\nThe second part of question 1 as well as the questions 2 and 3 are obsolete after following the above instructions and successfully reinstalling Mac OS X Lion.\n*: A MacBook Pro (Late 2010) never was produced/sold, so I assume it's a MacBook Pro (Mid 2010)\n", "Q: How to rescue light red Time Machine backups Today I've been looking for deleted by mistake folder.

I know the login information for the iCloud that I had set up for it and I was wondering if there's absolutely any way that I could retrieve those photos.  If not, I guess I'll live with it, but those were really important and I gotta know if there's some way to get em back.\n\nA: If you didn't back up the photos, they're gone, sadly.\nIf you connected the iPod to the computer, iTunes may have backed them up without you realizing it, So check there first.\nIf you enabled iPod backups, you can send iPod on any other device and manage the storage to see if the iPod has a backup.

Hopefully this will be fixed in a later build.\nForce quitting the process for now.\n\nA: When it happened to me and I opened iPhoto, I found it iPhoto tried to show the pictures in my iPad, but failed to do so. So it seems to be related to a temporary failure of retrieving the photos\nI closed iPhoto, unlocked iPad, unplugged and replugged in the iPad, and everything was fine (PTPCamera peacefully stayed at 0% CPU usage). I doubt it was related to the iPad unlock, but am not completely sure. It could be fixed by the replugging.\n\nA: I would just force quit the process, and if that doesn't work, I'd make a command line script to constantly send the \"kill\" command.\n", "Q: What are the Best Ways to Speed Up a Mac? I have a 2012 Macbook Pro and although it seems to be working fine, over time it has seemed to become more sluggish and less snappy / responsive. So is there any good ways ways that I can 'speed up' my Mac? - this includes stuff like: maximising youtube videos 'lag', the RAM being used up very quickly, Photoshop operations taking a long time to load and Preview struggling to open very large (10000s x 10000s px in size) photos.\nMy Specs - Macbook Pro 13\" (Retina, Late 2012):\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*RAM: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB\n\n*OS: OS X Yosemite 10.10.4\n\n*SSD HD: 245/249.77 GB Used\n\n*Typical RAM Available with Safari + Chrome Open (with lots of\ntabs): 2.5 GB\n\n\nA: The only thing I can see which might help is freeing some space on your hard drive. \nWith the lack of free space OS X won’t be able to make use of Virtual Memory as efficiently as it should, or possibly at all. I’m not 100% sure about Yosemite, but I’ve experienced a big performance hit on previous OS X releases when the OS can’t allocate as much RAM as it wants to. \nWith tools like Photoshop, are you using a separate scratch disk? If not then you’ll be relying on the little internal storage available which will result in OS X having to free up RAM (rather than swapping it) to apply effects/filters/etc. \n\nA: Looking at your data - your storage has to be performing horribly.\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD HD: 245/249.77 GB Used\n\n\nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a bootable backup and test it (or make sure your Time Machine or off-site backup is solid and you know how to restore / how long that will take)\n\n*Make a new user account\n\n*Delete your main user account and let the Users & Groups preference pane delete all your user files.\n\n*Boot the mac into recovery and run disk utility to check the directory structure and most importantly - allow the unused blocks to be trimmed. (alternatively you could boot into single user mode and run fsck on the unmounted volume. That trims unused blocks equally well)\nOnce that is done, start up the Mac and log in to your new test account.\nCollect timing statistics on what you wish to benchmark. Make sure you have repeatable numbers (maybe run 5 tests - see if you have to discard high/low values - if so, better to make 10 measurements).\nNow that you have a solid benchmark of how the software performs with enough space on the drive to arrange the storage efficiently and for rapid read/write performance, you can contemplate moving back some or all of your user files from your backup.\nI like to keep 50 GB or 10% of free space on my SSD - whichever is the larger amount for maximum performance. Any less than 6 GB free + size of RAM is a danger zone and means I am sacrificing serious speed to have the drive that full. Get a 64 GB RAID USB flash drive for $20, or USB SSD or spinning HDD to hold your large files and you will probably have to do nothing else to speed up your Mac.\n\nA: These are the steps I would generally recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup\n\n*Run Disk Utility from the Recovery Partition (press cmd+R at startup)\n\n*Run Onyx\n\n*Reinstall OS X (e.g. from recovery partition)\n\n*Clean reinstall OS X (i.e. wipe partition, install OS X, restore backup)\n\n\nAfter each step, see if you get better results. \nIn your case I think you have a very decent machine and it shouldn't really be much slower than current MacBooks, especially since you already have a SSD. \nHowever, your SSD is too full. A SSD needs ideally about 1/4 of empty space to maintain performance. Also OSX is known to slow down on full disks. In your case step 5 may be necessary, because maybe the SSD couldn't effectively do garbage collection or TRIM. By overwriting the disk empty blocks get reinitialised. You can try activating TRIM in the future (if using a non-Apple SSD). \n\nA: I am quickly summarizing up the best way to speed up a slow mac performance:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Find resource hungry processes\n\n*Close applications\n\n*Prune all the startup programs\n\n*Reduce transparency and animations\n\n*Use a light web-browser like Google Chrome \n\n*Disable FileVault disk encryption\n\n*Speedup the finder\n\n*Free up some extra drive space using software like Stellar Speedup Mac\n\n*Reset your SMC to fix all type of errors\n\n*Uninstall Unused Fonts\nFinally, reinstall Mac OS X if it is still slow.\n\nA: Your setup looks quite reasonable so there's nothing hardware to update. \nYou should definitely launch Onyx and do all the cleaning + do every checkbox proposed in automation.\nIn addition, I would install Magican, remove any redondant files and uninstall unused software. \nAt last, Yosemite transparency effect eats up a lot of memory and power. You can disable it in system preference > accessibility. \n", "Q: Losing connection with wireless headset since restoring computer I have a Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 connected to my Macbook Air which loses the connection to the headset every 5-15 minutes.\nThe headset is now several months old and I haven't had any problems until a few weeks back. Around the same time I restored my computer with first installing Yosemite and then a week later installing the El Capitan public beta (currently on Public Beta 3, 15A243d).\nWhen the headset loses its connection I can still see the headset in the OS X speaker selector, since the USB dongle is connected.

I'm using both, but I'd love to be able to connect my MacBook Pro to my PC's keyboard, mouse and monitor.\nNormally I have to go under the desk, take all the cables out then connect them to my Mac, and it's a pain to do.\nI'm wondering if it's possible to make it easier somehow?\n\nA: Depending on your PC specs you may use a VGA or HDMI USB KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch.\nThis will allow you to connect 2 or more computers to one screen, mouse and keyboard, and switch between them pressing a button.\nThe keyboard and mouse must be USB (wired or wireless) in this case, so they work on both computers.\nThere are plenty on Amazon and eBay.\nOn my experience, VGA KVMs have problems with screen resolution and offer a generally crappy viewing experience; I ordered an HDMI one and may update the answer based on its performance.\n", "Q: How do i unlink my iMessages between mac and iPhone? I just recently bought a new macbook pro, and I've found that my iMessages directly send to my mac whilst I'm using it, which is very helpful. However when I shut down my mac, the replies to my messages are still sent to the mac, and not my iPhone. They do not end up showing on my iPhone at all.  \nIs there any way I'm able to fix this by having my iMessages send to both devices? Or even whenever I turn off my mac, have my messages retrieved back onto my iPhone? \n\nA: For consistency, it is advisable to have the same settings on all your devices.\nOn iOS go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under the \"You can be reached by iMessage at\", how many addresses are there and which are activated (whit a check to the left).\n\n*Under \"Start new conversations from\" check to see if your phone number is selected, and if it is not, what email address is.\nIf you have more than one iOS device, check that they are set the same way.\nThen go to OS X, and on the Messages app, go to Preferences > Accounts; under iMessage > Settings check that the information coincides with those of your iOS device(s).\nIf you are sending and receiving from different email addresses or an email on one device and a phone number on another, your recipients will actually have multiple separate conversations with you and when replying to one or another will be sending messages to the device associated with that address. \nIf the device is offline, you won't receive the message. If all are configured the same way you eliminate this problem.\nAll the conversations you have with a contact look the same, independent of the address they used to send.\nIt's not easy to know to which address you're talking to; on iOS you have to tap details, then on the the (i) to the right of the name, and see which of the contact addresses or numbers is highlighted in blue. \n", "Q: How to move files to pendrive (NTFS/FAT)? I'm using Macbook (Yosemite) as my main computer right now, I'm downloading a lot of movies and whatnot from the internet on my Mac and I want to move them to my pendrive so I will be able to watch them on my Windows PC / TV.\nThe problem is I don't know how to move files from OS X so they will be recognized by other systems. I've been testing exFAT but it's not supported by most (all?) TVs. I've been looking for stuff like FREENTFS, but this doesn't work (even breaks) Yosemite.\n\nA: FAT32 is generally a good choice as just about everything supports it. You may run into a problem with FAT32 though. It's maximum file size is 4GB, which might be an issue with some movie files, and the maximum volume size is 32GB.\nIf those limitations are acceptable that would be my recommendation.\n\nA: ExFAT is definitely the choice for both macOS and Windows, but maybe not the TVs (maybe few support this). FAT32 has a size limitation of 4GB on a single file. So, if you are dealing with movie files, FAT32 is definitely not a good idea. (I didn’t know this a long time ago, so what happened to me was it allowed me to copy the files that are bigger than the limitation onto the drive but once I ejected and remounted it back, the files are corrupted)\nSo, we’ve come to the conclusion that NTFS is a good choice for storing movie files on a pen drive so that they are readable on all devices (macOS, Windows, TVs). The only problem with NTFS is that you have to install a driver on your Mac in order to grant your Mac the ability to write on an NTFS drive (since Mac doesn’t support writing data onto NTFS volumes). In this case, Paragon NTFS for Mac is recommended to achieve this.\nStill, I cannot guarantee you that your drive is 100% recognizable by your TV, it also depends on your TV, usually in common sense, it should support both FAT32 and NTFS.\n", "Q: Cannot cleanup OS X trash OSX just won't let me clean the trash can.\nI delete the \"Previous System\" folder (did it before a year ago and it worked

deeper just one level up. After that a directory with depth \"one\" remains which can be deleted. \nLets assume you have an \"infinite\" directory a/a/a/a/a/a/a/....\nthen you do: \nmv a/a b\nrm -r a\nmv b/a a\nrm -r b\n\nRepeat until no directory is left over. \nAnalogous to our \"confdir-14B--\" the following script works.

Up to that point I shared an account with my mother. Since updating my phone all of her contacts are on my phone. I created a new apple Id to keep all of our content separated. I now have a mac and want to use the cloud to get data from my phone but do not want to share everything with my mom. Everything on my phone that requires apple ID has only my account not hers. Help?\n\nA: If I get what you mean, you would probably like Family Sharing. It allows you to share data with another Apple ID, but keep thing separate (e.g your mom can download iTunes things from your account and you can download things from her account, but she can't read your iMessage and you can't read hers).\n", "Q: Deleting Photos, what iCloud saves and how to access things from iCloud and device storage issues My understanding (erroneous as I may be told this is) is that iCloud is like a virtual external drive to some extent. Maybe that is my first mistake. But before everyone starts saying to look at other posts, please know I believe I have read all the posts about photo stream, camera roll, and the link that was posted (in one of these answers on this general topic) about iCloud backups, as well as those Q&A's related to freeing up space. I am still confused. \nI am reaching storage capacity on my iPhone. I have a lot of photos on my phone because they've always migrated over from phone to phone every year or so. However, I need to free up some space and would like to delete photos from my iPhone (the device I took them on), but am still not sure if I do this, if it will remain on iCloud.\nI have an iPad and a Macbook too, and they (the photos and docs) are on there, but with photos I just don't ever want to lose, I want to be sure that if I start deleting off my phone, and my computer gets stolen or dies and my iPad is broken or whatever, that I can still always access all of my photos by just logging in to iCloud from any device.\nI (supposedly) have iCloud backing up all of these things. However, If I log into iCloud.com, I do  not see my documents and photos. Shouldn't I conceivably be able to log in to iCloud.com from any device (Apple or not - say my work computer) and access my saved documents and photos?\nBecause I cannot go to iCloud.com (not settings/iCloud - bit iCloud.com) and see these things, I am hesitant to delete photos from my phone, depending on the idea that they are stored in iCloud. The same is true, to a different extent with my documents.\nI have purchased extra storage on iCloud w/the idea that these things will always be there. What am I missing.\nAlso, aside from apps, photos and documents - are there some less obvious things I can delete that will free up space that would not be evident to the less than professionally savvy user?\n\nA: Your question is probably about 5 ones about how things work, so I'll address the elephant in the room.\nYou need to decide how you want your photos to be stored.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where do you archive them for long term storage?\n\n*How many can you afford to lose?\n\n*When and how will you clean up all the photos that come from dozens of places so that your long term albums don't have hundreds of internet cat meme pictures and screen shots from iOS?\n\n\nI would recommend sitting down with a nice cup of tea or coffee and a large piece of paper and just list out what devices you want to take pictures from, what the master collection looks like, and how you'll manage things coming in to and out of that master collection.\nOnce you've done that, you can look at iCloud through a web browser - https://www.icloud.com/#photos and get a good picture of how close that \"master collection\" is to your ideal collection. \nThen look at your Storage Settings - https://www.icloud.com/#settings\n\nIf you are running short, pay a little $$ for one month to buy yourself time and space to get everything safely into iCloud.\nThen you can decide if you have a computer to hold things and want to make use of the free iCloud photo stream to get all your photos onto that computer or if you want another solution (google has one, dropbox has one, yahoo/flickr has one, many custom services exist for amateurs and pros to store photo libraries online).\nBest of luck. The site will be here for you to ask more narrow questions once you have decided how to steer your ship. It's hard for us to advise you on broad plans - but once you make the broad plans - we can help you navigate certain bends in the river or certain customs officials that are prickly to get your on your way to happy photo management.\n\nA: The Photos link on iCloud.com lets you look at the contents of your iCloud Photo Library which is an optional part of the new Photos app. If there are no photos in it, the most likely explanation is that you don't have iCloud Photo Library enabled on any of your devices. It does not give you access to photos stored in iCloud as part of an iOS device backup, photos in iCloud Photo Sharing (previously named Shared Photo Streams), or photos in My Photo Stream. \nI'm not an Aperture user but my understanding is that enabling iCloud in it only gives access to My Photo Stream and Shared Photo Streams. I don't believe it enables iCloud as a backup destination for your Aperture libraries.\nPhotos does a nice job of giving you access to everything in your iCloud Photo Library on your devices without using n unreasonable amount of storage but it's not magic. For example, my iPL has 11,620 photos and 310 videos and uses 43GB on iCloud. However, it only uses 5.3GB on my iPad. That's very workable on a 32GB or larger iOS device but completely impractical on a 16GB device. \nIf you are using iPL, a delete on any device will delete the photo or video from every device. iPL does not give you the option to only keep a subset of your photos on a particular device. If you want that level of control, you need to look at alternatives like Google Photos or Dropbox. You might want to start with this article: http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-photo-management-solution\n\nA: The way I'm seeing this in laymen's terms, is that iCloud is an access point, through which you can get on anywhere,and have all your photos at your finger tips. But it is NOT an external hard drive, that is, it WILL NOT STORE your full size photos. You need one central storage point where you can house all your photos, and then you can delete them off your phone, or wherever, to free up space. You pay for more storage with iCloud because it still take up room to store the little thumbnails that you can see. \n\nA: the question here should be does or can the icloud free up space on your divice, since it seems to give you so much \"storage\" Short answer NO. \nWhat it really does is sync with your device and keeps a copy of your photos, but you still have all the photos on your device as well so still no space on your device,so for freeing up space or device. Don't look to the icloud.  \n", "Q: what happened to the shuffle option in iTunes Can anyone tell me how to get my iPod touch to shuffle my full music library with iTunes 12.1.0.50?\n\nA: You need to create a playlist with all of your music in iTunes, add that playlist to you iPod, and then when you select the playlist, you are given the option to shuffle the playlist at that top of the list.\n", "Q: Gaining access to data acquired by AppleScript outside of the script I'd be interested in using the data that I acquire with an AppleScript in another Framework, or even to write it to disk (the former is preferable).  For example, I have an AppleScript where I ask QuickTime Player to open a file and play it, then I poll the file's playhead location in a loop.  \nIs there any way that I can ship/pipe that data off elsewhere?\n\nA: Take a gander at this page. It has a few examples on how to write variables to a file. \n\nA: Not being clear as to what you are trying to do, maybe what you are looking for is a named pipe. \nYou create one like this...\nmkfifo mypipe\nand you could listen or consume what comes down the pipe like this...\ntail -f mypipe\nyou can now send data down the pipe from applescript like this...\non timeStamp()\n    return (current date) as string\nend timeStamp\n\nset aname to \"/home/user/some/dir/mypipe\"\n\nrepeat 10 times\n    do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of timeStamp() & \" > \" & aname\n    delay 5\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: Advanced gmail settings missing on iPad? I'm trying to make some changes to my gmail account on my iPad. All recommendations ask me to go into Settings, select mt gmail account, then select \"Advanced\" \nwhich I don't have as an option...\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The route is Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > [Name of your Gmail account]\nOn the first row of this screen it says Gmail and just below that, \"Account\"; to the right is the name of your account and an arrow. \n\nTap on the arrow. The \"Account\" screen is opened.\n\nOn the bottom row there is an \"Advanced\" button, tap on it.\n\n", "Q: Little Snitch automatically turning filter off? This issue happens to me in both my rMBP 13 and my Mac Pro. As I understand it, Little Snitch is not applying the rules when the network filter is off:\n\nBut why does it turn itself off from time to time? I always have manually to restart the filter.\n\nA: That's its demo behaviour, it will run for 3 hours then switch off.\nCheck it thinks it's authorised.\n'Open Little Snitch Preferences...'\nRegistration tab\n\nAlso, as you are running it on 2 computers, ensure you have a separate Registration for each [or a Family License] otherwise if it sees 'itself' on the network it will switch off.\nYou are correct in your assumption that it is not applying the Rules when the Network Filter is off.\n", "Q: Is netatalk on Linux unreliable for hosting Time Machine volumes? During some discussion on IRC about my recent problems hosting a Time Machine volume on my Linux PC (using netatalk) -- which worked well for a long time but recently developed issues where my Mac kept telling me I needed to start the whole backup over* -- one user stated that doing so is inherently unreliable because Apple's AppleTalk implementation (and maybe Time Machine-specific bits) has certain kinds of error correction built in that netatalk doesn't have. He was quite opinionated about this and strongly encouraged me to use an actual Time Capsule or an external hard drive connected to my Mac.\nI haven't run into anyone else who believes this, though, although I have talked to quite a few people who run the netatalk setup and say it works well for them. What substantiation is there to this hypothesis about unreliability and relative lack of error correction?\n\n\n*\n\n*EDIT: The exact message is \"Time Machine completed a verification of your backups. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you.\"\n\n\nA: My experience is netatalk is fine until the volume is full and Time Machine starts removing old backups selectively. The deletion process (which involves unlinking a whole load of hard links) seems to be the point at which netatalk falls over and you get the dreaded 'verification' message.\nFrom what I can tell, people who say \"it works fine\" generally haven't got to the point where their disk is full. \nHowever even external hard drives connected to a AirportExtreme are not immune to this error message. The only completely reliable backup systems I have used are the internal hard drive in an AirportExtreme, and a USB hard drive connected locally.\n", "Q: Java and Flash Player do not work on Chromium I've just installed the latest version of Chromium. But, neither Java nor Flash Player work.\nHow can this be fixed? As far as I can see, Chromium no longer supports PPAPI and NPPAPI.\n\nA: Unfortunately Google seems to think they know better than everyone else what people need to use online...\nHere's the deal. They've deprecated those APIs, meaning if you want Java/Flash to work, you're out of luck.\nHOWEVER, they haven't been removed yet, merely disabled.

Just out of curiosity and for my knowledge, from a software and hardware standpoint prospective, I read:\n\nWhen you use your device (iPhone) to access data, a Wi-Fi connection uses less power than a cellular network\n\nDo you know why?\n\nA: The Wi-Fi antenna in your phone has a typical range of few meters. It finds a Wi-Fi router within that range. So the power of the signal should be enough that it would be able to survive for few meters.\nOn the other hand, for 3G data transfer, you need to send the signals to the receiving antenna which could be a up to a few kilometers from where you are. So the signal should be strong enough to survive a few kilometers.\nTo give an idea, let's assume:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Wi-Fi router is at a distance of 5 meters.\n\n*The 3G receiver antenna of service provider is at a distance of 2 kilometers (2000 meters).\n\n*We know that the signal strength is inversely proportionate to the square of distance.\nSo, in order that we have the same signal strength at the receivers antenna of wifi and 3G; the transmitted signal should be of ratio:\n(2000/5)^2 = 160000\n\nSo the 3G signal should be 160,000 times stronger than Wi-Fi signal. Hence 3G data transfer consumes more power.\nNote: We have not considered packet loss when sending data over longer distances, which, although less significant, contributes to a greater power requirement of 3G transmission.\nSource: Kingsley, K.

I then needed to repeat the process of restoring from Time Machine, but now the MacBook is in a stupid state.\nThe system starts with OS X Utilities. Restore from Time Machine backup gets me to the point where it wants to know the destination drive, but my SSD doesn't show up.\nSame thing if I choose Reinstall OS X.\nIf I select Disk Utility, I can see the SSD as \"Macintosh HD\" and I can see \"First Aid\" and \"Partition\" but no \"Erase\". If I select \"Verify Disk\" or \"Repair Disk\", the log shows that everything is working fine....it is 499.42Gb in size. The OS X Base System volume is also there....\nSo without seeing \"Macintosh HD\", I cannot recover from Time Machine or Reinstall OS X.\nI am stuck, any ideas folks?\n\nFollow-up:\nThanks for your kind reply.  To explain again:\n\n\n*\n\n*I restored a Time Machine version of OS X 10.10.3, then I did some work and then decided to recover the same version of Time Machine backup a 2nd time.\n\n*The second restore of OS X 10.10.3 failed.\n\n*Using Disk Utility, I can see the \"Macintosh HD\" volume, but only the tags \"First Aid\" and \"Partition\" are shown.\n\n\nI followed your procedure described above to create a USB boot system.  The following happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*A 4Gb USB stick was declared by the system as being too small.\n\n*I eventually found a 16Gb USB stick and the download proceeded, but when the system was in \"Setting up....\" mode, I got a warning that the memory was too small and that memory was nearly full.  A short while later I got a \"Memory Full\" error!!! and nothing further other than the spinning wheel and a waste of time.\n\n*Next day I went to the store and bought a 64Gb USB stick.  When I started the system copy process, the Internet was having issues it I received a notice that the process would take around 738hrs!!!!\n\n*Eventually I got to a 2hrs15min download and the process completed, except the notice that my system would restart in 10secs never happened....I clicked the \"Restart\" soft key and off we went.  10hrs later I was still seeing the \"Setting up....\" message and the occasional flicker of the USB LED.\n\n*I then found a bootable OS X 10.8.2 and restarted my Macbook Pro.\n\n*Using the Disk Utility, I can see the \"Macintosh HD\", but again only the \"First Aid\" and \"Partition\" tabs are shown.\n\n*This time when I do a \"Repair Disk\" I get the messages:\n\"disk0s2 has CoreStorage features not supported by this fsck_cs version\"\n\"Problems were encountered during repair of the partition map\"\n\"Error: This disk needs to be repaired.

I have an issue is with bullets in a rich-text editor. If I want to put several paragraphs under one bullet, like this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Bullet one\n  \n*Bullet two paragraph one\nBullet two paragraph two\n  \n*Bullet three\n  \n\nI can achieve this by typing ctrlReturn at the end of paragraph one (rather than Return). The beginning of the text that I type after that will indent properly inside the bullet rather than create a new bullet.\nBut my problem is doing that after a second-level bulleted list, like so:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Bullet one\n  \n*Bullet two, first part\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Inner bullet list, first item.\n  \n*Inner bullet list, second item.\n  \n  \n  Bullet two, second part\n  \n*Bullet three\n  \n\nI can't find any way to make the \"Bullet two, second part\" indent properly to the bullet level without a bullet. The ctrlReturn trick brings me to the inner bullet list level. Trying to tab back from there adds a bullet. Trying to remove the bullet by simply selecting and deleting it seems to work... until I add a new bullet down the list, at which point the bullet is restored.\nIs it possible to continue the text of a bullet after a secondary bulleted list, and if so, how?\n\nI'm using Curio, which has text objects that are apparently based on Core Text (rich text editing), and I'm trying to work with bullet lists in it. For all intents and purposes, if there is a solution for TextEdit, it will probably work for me as well.\n\nA: I want to answer your question, even though this thread is more than 5 years stale. I imagine this worked back then just the same.\nThe answer given before was likely not what you wanted. I wouldn't really want that either if there's a more simple way to manage. There is, so I will show you. It's not perfectly elegant, but much better I think than the other option.\n\nOkay, so the way we go about this is to begin on our Bullet two, first part where we would actually use the ctrl Return trick before we put the inner list. Don't worry - we still add the inner list as usual, but just further down, and then move it. Once you have a couple of new lines at the \"Bullet two, first part\" level WITHOUT a bullet, then press Return and get a new one WITH a bullet. Add anything such as \"Bullet two, second part\", then Return then Tab to get your new indentation bullet.\nOnce you're here - you just add your Inner bullet list (the one for up above). Then you can highlight it and copy/paste up above where you wanted it. You can then put your \"Bullet two, second part\" bullet on the line below that where you left an empty line indented at the \"Bullet two, first part\" level.\nHere's a GIF of the whole process to make it perfectly clear what is happening.\n\nI will say, that there's still some caveats such as if you go to add another inner bullet item by pressing Return on the last one, it will break the whole thing. You'll need to be careful and try to remember the ctrl Return technique on those. Still probably preferable if you know what you're doing.\n\nA: Many WYSWYG text editors and word processors try to anticipate your formatting intentions.  It takes a bit of work to overcome this at times, selecting lists, deselecting lists, adding formatting after the fact, etc.\nFor a bit more control while working, you can manually insert bullets in your text along with using tabs.  See Screenshot.  Not using the list but rather setting your tabs manually and typing the bullets manually is a bit more work at first but gives you the control you need.  This should work in most text editing environments.\noption ⌥+8 will make a text bullet • (You can use any character you wish too either by typing the key combination or using the Character Viewer)\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Time machine creating files and directories at random places I'm gonna keep this short and simple.

Is this normal behaviour? If not, what might be the cause and how can I fix it?\n\nA: This seems harmless to me. If you want to clean things up, I would sudo tmutil disablelocal to clean up any local snapshots and then make a new test user and turn off automatic user log in.\nReboot and log in as test and make a clean backup interval without your user being logged in or any files open from the main ~ directory.\nAt that point, you can check for any odd files or delete them entirely (sudo -s from the test user to become root and able to delete things in your normal user folder).\nAgain, I don't think any of this will cause issues, but it might be nice to clean things up as described and have a known good backup interval where all files are properly closed and backed up once. Handling files that are always open or always changing is hard for backup tools - so excluding them by rule is also an option.\ntmutil isexcluded\n\ntmutil addexclusion file1 file2\n\n", "Q: Does iPhone 4S have a region lock?

Here's the solution... follow me on this, it gets a little bumpy.\nFirst, the goal again is to have iTunes (with Apple Music active) show you the complete list of songs for an album where you are missing one or more of the songs.\nIf you right click a song in the album and select \"Go To Album\", you will be taken to your local copy of the album (specifically you will see My Music in Album view).  Unfortunately this shows you only the songs that you have, and gives no option to display the entire album.\nHowever, if you delete one song from the album (select a track, hit Delete, and confirm that you wish to Delete Item), then the \"Show Complete Album\" option will suddenly appear.  \nBut, there's a catch.  Deleting the item that is currently selected, means there is no selection once the deletion is completed, and so you will be dumped out of the album you were looking at, and taken to the top of your Albums list.  Whatever album you were looking at, is now down below somewhere... and you're going to have to find it manually.\nOnce you again open your album, you are presented with all your existing tracks as well as all missing tracks, which will have an \"Add\" button next to them.  There is also an \"Add All Tracks\" button.\nDO NOT PRESS \"ADD ALL TRACKS\"!  Doing so will add a second copy of all the album's tracks, in your music library.  You must click the individual Add buttons next to the missing tracks you want to add again.\nBut there's another catch.  Sometimes - but not always in my case - clicking Add causes the missing tracks to all disappear.  I had to \"close\" the album by clicking on it, then open it again, and the remaining missing tracks once more appeared.  Rinse & repeat for every click of the Add button.\nBut sometimes, it just works fine and you can click Add several times in a row for all missing tracks, and you're all set.\nSo that's it.  Once you see \"No additional songs found\" and there are no longer any Add buttons, then you've got the complete album once again.\nWhat a huge pain, and very confusing to figure it out.  I pretty much got lucky in connecting the dots to figure this out.\n", "Q: I can't open my ipad mini.

And one of the most popular programs to do that is called \"Sendmail.\" Not that you need to know that, but hey...\nAnyway to be able to send and receive email you need both an SMTP server and an incoming mail server that speaks either POP or IMAP. I won't go into Exchange here as it is Microsoft's own take on IMAP.\nOften times the sending and receiving servers are the same. At work mine is mail.domain.local. It sounds like you may have plugged in the same server (or IP address) for sending email into the receiving (POP/IMAP) mail location in your mail.app. If it didn't work, you will have to bug your IT folks for the POP/IMAP address too.\n", "Q: Reboot fails after failed disk erase when restoring from Time Machine I have an Early 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15\" with 512GB of SSD storage.\nMy update to Yosemite 10.5 failed for some reason and I was left with an unbootable system and severe file system errors that prevented the system from booting up (fsck_hfs -fy fails and fsck_hfs -ry complains about disk full, although there were about 8% of 500GB left. So I guess the file system is beyond repair.)\nSo I fired up the rescue system and started \"Restore from Time Machine\". This worked fine until it erased my disk, which took quite long (about five minutes) and made the fans spin up to full power. Then it displayed a message about it having failed and that I should reboot and try again.\nAfter rebooting, the system does not start any more at all. Not into Recovery (Cmd-R), not into Internet Recovery (Cmd-Alt-R), not after resetting PRAM (Cmd-Alt-P-R) or SMC (Shift-Ctrl-Alt+Power) and surely not when not pressing any boot up keys. I can see the backlight of the screen power up, but that's it. I also now have the bootup chime back, which I turned off before, so I know at least the SMC reset worked.\nAfter about ten seconds when powered on, the fans again spin up to full speed. Nothing else happens (I waited for about ten minutes several times).\nNow what? I cannot boot even into rescue mode and I have no idea how to make the machine boot any more at all.\nHow do I get this machine running again?\n\nA: It seems it was the SSD. (Or the SATA controller - I'm not quite sure yet.)\nRemoving the SSD from its plug caused the Mac to at least display a black and white folder icon with a \"?\" inside (like here: https://support.apple.com/HT204156) That gave me hope so I purchased a Transcend JetDrive 725 for Macbook Pro Retina Early 2013 and inserted it. Wohoo, Cmd-Alt-R started Internet Recovery and \"D\" started Apple Hardware Test!\nAHT said everything is fine, except the SATA controller has a problem (\"4HDD/11/4000000: SATA(0,0)\") but it seems to work fine so far. I'm not sure I need to worry because this error can also be a false positive according to Apple: https://support.apple.com/HT203648\nI'll torture the new SSD with Disk Utility and by replaying my Time Machine Backup and then we'll see.\nOh: and plugging the Apple SSD into the USB3 enclosure supplied by Transcend and attaching this to a PC froze the PC before even displaying the BIOS screen. Connecting it to a running system does not create a new mount point and results in lots of errors in the system log. So this seems to confirm my suspicion that it was the SSD.\n", "Q: Mavericks 10.9.5 / MBP 17 2011 - system intermittently hangs when a USB mouse is plugged in This has happened to me a number of times (6-10).  I am not sure of the specific circumstances because it is not easily replicated.\nI usually only use the trackpad, because I am just typing.  But sometimes I will plug in a USB mouse for a while.  \nThis is what happens.\nThe system continues working but does not respond in any way to the mouse, trackpad or keyboard.  So it is essentially frozen, except for whatever was started when it happened.\nThe only way I have found to get out of it is to hold down the power button to reboot.  This is asking for trouble, not least because I am usually running a Postgres server on my machine - worries about database corruption though it has never happened yet.\nSo right now, I was watching a YouTube video, plugging the mouse in and it happened again.  YouTube happily continued playing the video, so its not like the computer is frozen, but its peripherals are locked out.\nIt's hard to tell from looking at the Console app, because there is a lot of stuff going there and you get all the diagnostics from the booting up sequence.

If you set up Time Machine to backup Macintosh HD, it will only backup Macintosh HD. Also, Time Machine probably will reject backing up a Windows system. In order to backup your Windows, you either need to get another backup disk or partition your current one. Then, you can use the system Windows backup. \n\nA: Time Machine will not backup a Boot Camp partition - it will be shown in the exclusion list, greyed-out & un-editable.\n\nIt will backup Parallels VMs, however, a Boot Camp VM actually contains very little data from the Windows partition itself, only the superimposed VM part of the structure, so backing up the VM will not actually be backing up changes to Windows.\nA 'regular' VM will backup completely, though I understand that any small change to the .hdd file [the 'disk' itself] inside the .pvm will result in the entire file being backed up again, thereby eating your backup space at an alarming rate. \nI think your only real solution would be a Windows one, Windows' own backup [clumsy] or something like Acronis etc.\n", "Q: I upgraded an app on my iPhone 4, but this new version doesn't work. How do I replace for the older version? I did the stupidity of upgrading the newest version of AM 880 KIXI radio, a retro radio station in Seattle. The version I had was the previous one, the 2.8 and I held off upgrading for a long time, but in a moment of insanity, decided to do it and deleted the app and downloaded again on the AppStore, thus downloading the 3.6 version, the next one after the 2.8- i tried uploading directly, but I kept being redirectioned to the app itself, that's why I deleted before downloading again. \nThe thing is my internet connection isn't that good, but the app always worked fine, but now with this version it keeps buffering at lot and it doesn't even show the music that's playing anymore, even when my connection is speedy. Is there any way to undo this? I have an iPhone 4 that hasn't been backed up to a computer, so I don't have the previous version saved as a .ipa file. I have iOS 7.0.4.  Seriously, what do I do? I know I sound desperate, but I listen to this station very single day, specially during work(I'm a translator) and it's essential for me to help concentrate. Is there any way I can retrieve the previous version of the app I was using?

Time Machine or otherwise? If so you can restore the file from a backup.\nThe iPhone apps are located in ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications and end with the \".ipa\" extension.\nIt has been a while since I tried this but I think you just have to place the restored file in the proper folder and sync your phone.\n", "Q: What will \"rm -rf /\" actually do? I know that this is a very dangerous command, but what does it actually do. In other words, to what extend does it delete the hard drive. Does it delete only the user data? Or does it delete root OS files as well. If someone were to activate this command, would it break the OS?\nRunning as sudo on Yosemite \n\nA: The command itself is \"rm\", which is a program used to remove a file.\nThe \"-rf\" is the first argument to the program. Arguments can be thought of as \"settings\" or other information that you want the program to use while performing its task.\n\"-rf\" is really a short hand for two seperate arguments, \"-r\" and \"-f\":\n-r means that you want the program to not only remove files, but also directories, and that you want the program to remove not only the files/folders that you request, but also any subfolders and their contents.\n-f means that you do not want to be prompted for confirmation on each delete, and that attempts should be made to delete every file/folder listed, no matter if you have permissions to do so orr not.\nThe last part of the command \"/\" is actually the list of what you want the program to delete. In this case \"/\" means the \"root\" (the top) of the file hierarchy. In practice this means to do delete everything on your system - including files on external drives that may be mounted.\nThe command does not discriminate between user data or operating system files. As long as you have permissions to delete a file/folder, it will be deleted.\nWhen run as sudo (i.e. with root permissions) under Yosemite, it will break the system so that it doesn't function afterwards.\nFor newer versions of macOS, destruction will be limited by the SIP system that protects the operating system core. However, still do not run the command with sudo, as you risk ruining the system and deleting your own data.\n", "Q: Can I move pictures from my iCloud library to another I have 200G of iCloud storage and about 120G of it is about 12,000 photos. They are all in my account.\nI want any pictures anyone in my family takes to make it into this list. However, the only way I can figure out how to do this is to put my iCloud information as the primary iCloud account on all devices, which I don't want to do. I want each family member to use their own iCloud account (which is connected to mine via the family settings.)\nTo be clear, I want this to be totally automatic, just take a picture and it's everywhere, which seems to rule out shared photo libraries.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: No. You'd have to set up your iCloud account on their devices as the main account to use for pics, find my iPhone, backups, etc, and then set up their iCloud account as a secondary for email, notes, mail, and iMessage and FaceTime.  Unfortunately that's the only way. \n", "Q: Does anyone know how apps are published on the same day as new iOS release? Does anyone know how apps are published on the same day as new iOS release? \nBecause Xcode doesn't launch until then (except for the beta version).

I've never gone to iCloud before to check on my back ups and just assumed they occurred. However when i go to iCloud it shows nothing but find phone. Is there a way to see photos? The only question i see that actually addresses this is negatively voted on, and the only answer did not address the Question but was geared toward organizing library and space on cloud. I just want to know my stuff is there. How? if I cannot see it??\n\nA: If you enable iCloud Photo Library on your Mac, and your photos are on the Photos app, you can set it up to save originals on the cloud and automatically save space by keeping a lower resolution copy on your Mac.\nTo do this, go to Preferences > iCloud, then select \"Optimize\". \nThis will also allow you to view your entire collection on iCloud.com if you wish.\nNote that you have no saying on when the app starts \"saving space\" on your behalf, and that if you delete a photo on your Mac it will be deleted on iCloud too; it is more a synchronization service than a storage on the cloud service, with the advantage of the space optimization.\nAlso, there is no Mac iCloud backup service to my knowledge; you can only backup to Time Machine —or some other backup service of your preference, of course. You may have some of your documents synchronized to iCloud but if you delete them locally they will also be deleted there.\nTime Machine erases old backups when it runs out of space, so it won't work as a long term storage solution either, unless you have lots of space available —so it does not need to delete your old backups in order to make space for the new ones.\n\nA: My understanding is that iCloud is for storage of photos, and not just for synchronization; otherwise, why would you have the option to purchase more space (which I have done). That being said, @Jaime Santa Cruz is correct in that you cannot back up Time Machine to iCloud, but you should be able to indefinitely store photos, docs, notes, etc., so long as you keep within the storage limit or purchase (and continue to pay) for additional storage.\nI had the same problem and actually wrote a question about it just the other day and received a number or comments and an answer. Deleting Photos, what iCloud saves and how to access things from iCloud and device storage issues It seemed clear from what others were saying that I should be able to see icons in iCloud, such as photos, and when you click on/open these tabs you should be able to see your photos/docs. I could not. \nIt was suggested I contact Apple support if there was nothing there aside from Find My Phone (which there was not - sounds like this is what you are saying). I did contact Apple and sure enough, there was a problem on iCloud/Apple's end and they need to remotely reset my iCloud account(this is the word they used, from a  technical perspective I have no clue what was wrong or what they did to fix it), but after about 15 minutes with them iCloud appeared as it should and never had before. There was an orange background with most of the app icons that appear on the dock, and I could now view my photographs and documents, etc.\nIf iCloud is turned on, your devices are synced and you are going to iCloud.com and getting a black background with just a FMP, you probably need to do what I did.\n", "Q: Constant ApplicationManager quit unexpectedly Message I keep getting a window saying ApplicationManager quit unexpectedly.

If I go in to 2014 year, I can see that pictures have location information.\n\nHas anyone had this problem?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This has been going on since iOS 7 and I started using iOS 7 when it was beta.\n\n*It is not that I have been to many places in 2014. In that case it should have said \"United States, Canada & 4 more\" (something like that)\n\n*I called apple support but they couldn't help.\n\n*I have the same problem on both iOS Photos app and Mac Photos app. For this reason, I have sent Mac Photos app diagnostic information to apple as a bug report but no luck there either.\n\n*I have reset and restored my phone, and iCloud pictures and no luck.\n\n*I have iCloud Photo Library on.\n\n\nA: I think it is probably down to visiting lots of countries maybe?\nFor example, I have currently visited 7 countries this year (2018) and I am sure my info was there a month ago.\nIt seems to be a sequence as someone has mentioned already with ‘this country, this country & 3 others, where it doesn’t seem to mention 4 others or 5 others etc.\nAnother thing.... info does not show for me in 2015 either... that is the year I visited various Caribbean islands), so it’s probably a multi country thing.\nMaybe there is something in that?\n\nA: Yes, you are not alone. I've been having the same problem, started mid-way through 2014. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but wish I had.\nI've also gone through multiple rounds with Apple Support only for them to repeatedly tell me that I have no GPS data in 2014 pictures, despite the fact that the vast majority do have GPS data.\nA few months ago the same thing happened to me with 2015, lost location information in 'Years' view. I realised this was related to importing a series of photos from my GoPro, and after deleting them all from my library, adjusting GPS EXIF data and re-importing (this was before Photos for Mac supported editing GPS data directly), the issue went away.\nI suspect the issue is down to a selection of images that do not have GPS data / have invalid GPS data, causing something in Photos to barf.\nReading https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7174772?start=0&tstart=0 has led me to believe that it may be possible to create a smart album for all photos in 2014 that do not have GPS data. If so, then it can lead to one or more of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Export all untagged images, re-importing one at a time and identifying which image causes the library to stop summarising for the year\n\n*Identify a tipping point, if it's over a certain % of untagged images that causes the library to stop summarising for the year\n\n*Manually tag all the untagged images, where relevant, if it's a % issue.\n\n*Delete some images.\n\n\nSorry I don't have anything more helpful to report, but at least you know you're not alone! :-)\nIf you do make any progress on any of the above, please to share. I will also share if and when I'm able to identify anything further.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Restoring from IPSW.

I believe that's what causing itunes to throw the error (3014)\nTried pinging it, failed - \n\nSuprisingly, however, I can access it from the browser (why/how?) \n\nMy iPhone can recieve updates just fine over the same network. I'm stumped, can someone help me out, am i missing something?\nIf there's a way to update without the itunes server-check I'd love to hear it. Methods involving jailbreak are welcome\n\nA: Enter DFU Mode, and then try a restore. Method:\nFirst, plug the iPad into your computer, and then power it off. Make sure iTunes is running on your PC.\nNow press and hold both the Power button and Home button simultaneously, until you see the Apple logo. Now let go of the Power button while still holding down the Home button. iTunes can now associate with the device and is told that the iPad is in Recovery Mode.\nFinally, simply Restore your iPad to the ipsw file that you downloaded (or just restore, whatever your choice is).\nJust in case you didn't know, in order to restore an iOS device to a certain backup/ipsw file located on your Windows computer, shift-click the Restore iPad ( / iPhone / iPod) button in iTunes and find & pick the file manually.\n(Note: There is a tool I know of called Cydia Impactor. There's actually a desktop version of it as well. Unfortunately, however, it apparently only works with iOS 8.3 and 8.4 in the jailbreak version of the tool.)\n\nA: Fix Date/Time & update iTunes:\nFirst method is easiest of all three. You have to check for date and time on your computer whether it is correct or not? Many people were getting this error because date and time on their computer was incorrect and they got this error fixed after correcting the date and time. It is also advisable to update iTunes to latest version of iTunes. You can check for updates by by opening iTunes and then clicking on “check for updates”. If any updates are available iTunes will inform you about those updates and you can install those updates.\nTurn off Antivirus:\nSometimes the antivirus program installed on your computer may conflict with the host file of your computer which results in iTunes error 3014. So if you turn off your antivirus for sometime and then try to restore through iTunes you won’t get error 3014.\nFix Host File:\nThis is the most effective method of all three. In this method you are basically fixing the host file of your computer. Follow these steps to fix the host file on your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*To access the host file on your computer you have to go to\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\n\n*Delete the HOSTS file found in this directory. (you will need administrator access for deleting the hosts file.)\n\n*Download Hosts file from the bottom of this post and copy the downloaded hosts file in the same directory. (you will need administrator access for copying the hosts file.)\n\n*Once host file is copied in the above directory restart your computer and start restoring your device through iTunes.\n\nA: The problem is with your host file that is causing problem connecting with gs.apple.com. \nThis post will help you fix your host file. \nhttp://www.yourtechinfo.com/2015/08/top-3-ways-to-fix-itunes-error-3014.html\n\nA: go to C:Windows/System32/Drivers/Etc\nand open the hosts file in notepad\nand at the botton of the text file add this:\n74.208.105.171 gs.apple.com\n(Numer Symbol)74.208.10.249 GS.APPLE.COM\n(Numer Symbol)127.0.0.1 GS.APPLE.COM\n(Numer Symbol)74.208.105.171 GS.APPLE.COM\nthen Save!

I got my LCD screen changed a month ago when it broke, but now my phone is flickering when I unlock it. It goes back to normal after a few seconds. How do I fix this?\n\nA: The quick answer is that there isn't really much you can do on your end.\nWhat can I do?\n\n\n*\n\n*You could take apart the phone and attempt to fix the display manually, but by no means does this guarantee a fix (or even an improvement). By doing this, you would also run the risk of damaging your device further.\n\n*If Apple replaced your screen when it was broken, take it back to them and let them know it was not fully fixed. They should fix it again at no charge (if it was serviced within the last 90 days).\n\nApple covers defects if they arise from authorized service for 90 days or the remaining term of your iPhone warranty, whichever is longer.\n\n\n*If a third-party dealer replaced your screen, take it back to them.

How can I update my iPad to iOS 7 now, in 2015?\n\nA: You only ever have two options with iOS - stay on the iOS you're currently on, or update to the latest your device will support.\nApple stops signing all older iOSes within a few days of releasing a new version, meaning that even if you could install it, it would not activate.\nAs the iPad 2 is supported on iOS 8 [currently 8.4.1] this is your only choice if you wish to update.\n\nA: Ditto\nIf by 'Destroy' you mean your iPad2 locked up (As did mine) when it reboots after iTunes completed the download then fear not!\nAs long as it completed the install ( which seems evident since it rebooted) just remove it from the cable and do a hard reset. i.e. Hold both buttons in for a few seconds and it should restart and now boot with your nice new iOS 9\nIt will probably show an Apple icon with a cable icon suggesting you had better reconnect to iTunes , Connect back up, then all should be well and iTunes will complete and verify the installation :)\n", "Q: Enable screensharing via SSH and setting password I am trying to enable VNC (Screen Sharing) on my Mac running OS X Yosemite\nI have been able to run this command sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist (source) to turn VNC on.\nThe only issue running this command is, it sets a password automatically, in which I do not know what it is, I have to fix it by logging in physically to the computer.\nIs there a way how I can enable VNC via SSH and setting the password as the users password?\n\nA: If you need to set a VNC password - you might need to also kickstart the ARDAgent, you can use this command instead of just loading the plist:\nsudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all\n\nThe analogous command for using user/password of existing users would be:\nsudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers -configure -restart -agent -privs -all\n\nMore detail and discussion at:\nHow to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH?\n", "Q: Prevent Finder to launch on boot I do not need Finder because I use Ranger in CLI and I manually quit it (I added the quit option) each time I boot (mainly not to have it in the way when I use to switch applications with cmd + tab).\nIf it's not possible, an alternative would be to quit it from the terminal and I would do a script that is launched on boot.

Two days ago, somehow, my Mac running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 got infected by malware and it deleted almost all my files from my home directory. I have no idea how it happened (it wasn't because clicked on some ad, I wasn't even browsing the web when it happened and I also run Adblock on my Safari, Chrome, and Firefox browsers). Suddenly at 10 PM, an xterm window showed up with tons of lines running by with filenames and \"permission denied\" messages. I panicked and shut down the computer.\nI then restarted it and then when I open the Terminal, the xterm came up and started with similar \"permission denied\" messages (I figured it auto launched when I opened the Terminal). I shut down again and it did not appear to shut down completely. Then after a few minutes I tried to start it up and it did not start for the next 5 or 10 minutes or so. Then when it did start up, the OS X settings were all fresh (for example, my Dock was moved from left to the bottom center etc, as it would be if it were a fresh install).

Since all those files were deleted, we don't have hard evidence though.\nSaid .bashrc is derived from a (Linux-)precursor. It was heavily adapted to work with OS X.\nThe XQuartz service started to delete files with rm in the root folder after reading in the ~/.bashrc triggered by the xrd command. Most rms weren't successful because of missing user permissions. Most of the user data was deleted though.\nAfter creating a recovery thumb drive with Data Rescue 4 (the Bootwell feature) a deep scan found a lot of deleted files.

Then you'll have to create a temporary partition which you can then delete from Disk Utility.\nFor example,\n[onik@Oniks-MacBook-Air ~]$ diskutil list disk0\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            204.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:         Microsoft Reserved                         16.8 MB    disk0s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s4\nonik@Oniks-MacBook-Air ~]$ sudo gpt show disk0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  398437504      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  398847144        856         \n  398848000      32768      3  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE\n  398880768     228520         \n  399109288    1269760      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  400379048   89855676         \n  490234719         32         Sec GPT table\n  490234751          1         Sec GPT header\n\nshows that there is unused but reserved space at the end of the disk (the line after index 4). You can solve this by creating a partition in the space manually.\nBoot into recovery and open a terminal. Unmount the disk with diskutil unmountDisk disk0 (use your own disk number) and calculate the available space for the partition. OSX needs 262144 sectors of empty space after each partition, so subtract that from the size of the space available. After this, create the partition with sudo gpt add -b 400379048 -s 89829462 -t hfs disk0.\nAfter this, if you run diskutil list disk0 again, you'll see the partition, but you'll need to format it. sudo newfs_hfs -v \"Temporary volume\" -J /dev/rdisk0s5 will do the trick (but use your own disk and partition number). Now you can close the terminal, open up Disk Utility and delete the temporary partition, and Disk Utility will take care of the rest.\nNow just reboot and run Boot Camp Assistant again!\n"]
