["Q: Grub2 Issues After 16.04 LTS fresh install After two years of using 14.04 LTS I went to install it on my desktop, but wanted a newer ISO and was surprised to see the new 16.04 LTS sitting front and center a few days ago. So I said what the heck, may as well enjoy the new stable release. What was I thinking in putting stable and long-term in the same category for a release this new?\nAnyways, after having to reinstall due to an infinite login loop after updating my Nvidia proprietary drivers, I finally got my system back up and running, then I decided to fall back to 14.04 LTS and wait on the upcoming 16.04.1 (if not much farther out) update(s). Problem is, my Grub2 boot loader is gone. I can't boot into Ubuntu at all.\nI tried the boot-repair and even deleting grub2 with Windows repair disk, but I am still getting a broken grub2. I want to get this resolved before installing 14.04 LTS.\nBoot-repair gave me this link.\nI am running a Core i7 4771 CPU, 2GB GTX770 GPU and 16GB DDR3 Gaming RAM with two 1TB 7200RPM HDDs for storage. My Windows 10 (less than 200GB total) and Ubuntu are both running on the first 1TB and Ubuntu has a 16.3GB swap set up just for giggles. I am running 14.04 LTS on my Dell Inspiron M531R-5535 with zero issues and have even repaired the grub once, but I can't remember what broke it. I am not sure what is the problem. \n\nA: If Windows is UEFI, you need to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode. How you boot install media from UEFI/BIOS is then how it installs.\nBut if you have installed in BIOS boot mode, you can convert from BIOS to UEFI without reinstalling by uninstalling grub-pc(BIOS) and installing grub-efi-amd64(UEFI) and some settings changes. Boot-Repair in its advanced mode makes this relatively easy with the full uninstall/reinstall of grub. Be sure to boot Ubuntu installer in UEFI mode, and add Boot-Repair.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair \nDetails on screens in Boot-Repair:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair/home/Home/\nHow you boot install media from UEFI may not match default boot settings in UEFI for the actual install. Make sure you always boot in UEFI boot mode and have settings for UEFI. \n", "Q: Can't watch video in any website Ubuntu 14.04 Chromium I saw this post from yesterday on askubuntu.com\nand my problem is very similiar, except the pc has a AMD Radeon HD 8400 instead and I really don't know how to handle with this bug.\nIt's recent (one week), probably some feature missing in chromium, because I can listen the sound, but no picture, and everything works fine in firefox.\nI got all the updates, except the last kernel (rollback the dist-upgrade because triggered another issue with the virtualbox).\nBut now I have no idea how far I need go to put everything back working as before, and I'm seeking here for your guidance.\nThank you for your time and support ;)\nHi again.\nI have tested all the options suggested in the reply's, but none resolve the issue, and it's not duplicate with the suggested one.\nI haven't the flash installed, always watched in html5 (I think) with 0 problems, but now i installed that too, noting changed.\nIt seems to me, that now chromium can't decode the video or it's too heavy to handle with it, but shows all the ads, and notes.\nI don't know where to got the AMD Radeon HD 8400 drivers (none appears suggested in additional drivers)\nThanks again!\n\nA: First Step:\nYou are probably missing a plug-in on Chrome. Try looking online for any available plugins for Ubuntu, or check the file repositories. \nLast resort:\nEither that, or your Radeon graphics isn't liking that specific browser. Canonical has dropped a lot of support on AMD Radeon drivers, and AMD Radeon has a horrendous reputation on Ubuntu, when it comes to stability and support. From my experience.....Let's just say that AMD Radeon ended my Ubuntu installs on a few of my PCs. \nNvidia has a way better reputation in Ubuntu. I recommend switching to Nvidia. Nvidia isn't perfect, and you can and will run into some problem sometimes, but at least you won't have a bad graphics experience like AMD Radeon.  \nBut then again, it's probably Chrome. The best advice I could give you if that's the case, is that you need to switch to Firefox. I find Firefox more stable than Chrome.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to provide a backtrace? gnome-shell appears to be crashing with unsavoury results and the developers have asked me to provide a backtrace, what exactly is a backtrace and how do I get them what they need? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: A backtrace shows a list of an applications active functions. As functions are nested within each other when they are called the application must record where it left one function to get into another within it. This is done on the stack, we then dump the stack for the backtrace.\n\nPreparation\n\n\n*\n\n*In order to prepare your system for doing one, you must first make sure that apport is turned off as it normally replaces gdb. In order to do this simply change the line enabled=1 to enabled=0 in the /etc/default/apport file (after you have done with getting the backtrace manually you should re-enable apport by reversing the changes to the file), then restart your machine.\n\n*You now need to make sure that the relevant dubug symbols are installed, in order to do this for most packages just add the -dbg at the end, for instance with gnome-shell just run the following to install them:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-dbg\n\nGo here for information on manually installing debug symbols not available through this manner.\n\n*Now you need to make sure that you have gdb installed:\nsudo apt-get install gdb\n\n\nGeneration type 1 (application needing to be started)\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the application under the control of gdb in Terminal (if the application requires to be run as root then use sudo before the gdb command):\ngdb <application> 2>&1 | tee ~/gdb-<application>.txt\n\n\n*Then enter the following lines after each one you shall press ENTER (after run you may enter any arguments necessary that you need to run with the application):\nhandle SIG33 pass nostop noprint\nset pagination 0\nrun\n\nNow see Final steps section.\n\nGeneration type 2 (application not currently running)\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the PID of the application:\npidof <application>\n\n\n*Start gdb in Terminal (if the application requires to be run as root then use sudo before the gdb command):\ngdb 2>&1 | tee gdb-<application>.txt\n\n\n*Run the following as previously instructed (pressing ENTER after each line):\nhandle SIG33 pass nostop noprint\nset pagination 0\nattach <PID>\ncontinue\n\nNow see Final steps section.\n\nGeneration type 3 (backtrace from core dump)\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the core dump into gdb:\ngdb -c <coreDump> 2>&1 | tee gdb-<program>.txt\n\n\nFinal steps\nIf you used generation type 1 or 2, then you may now do whatever you need with the application to reproduce the bug you are reporting. After you have finished, if the program doesn't crash, press CTRL + C, and then run the following lines as with the previous provided (if the program crashes you still need to run the following lines to get the backtrace):\nbacktrace full\ninfo registers\nx/16i $pc\nthread apply all backtrace\nQuit\n\nYou now have your backtrace, attach it to your bug report (the ~/gdb-<application>.txt file).\n\nSource: Ubuntu Wiki: Backtrace\n\nA: I don't use gnome-shell so I'm sorta guessing but the following is true isn csh, bash and bash.\nSet the ulimit -c 5000.  This will allow a core dump.  The number set the maximum size of the dump.  You might have to vary the number so that the command will work.  If the gnome-shell window closes, the ulimit command MUST be re-entered. \nUbuntu should really turn this feature on for the early LTS distributions and development machines.    \nNow run gnome-shell and cause the dump.  There now should be a core file in the current directory.\nRun gdb $(which gnome-shell) core. There should be some kind of stack trace that shows up.  Send them stack trace.  If gnome-shell was compiled with the debug -g there might be statement numbers and functions calls in the traceback.\n", "Q: How do I add a new admin user? Ok, I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and I was an administrator, but then someone made a standard user and deleted the admin account. How do I make a new admin user without it asking me to enter a password? Or, is deleting the OS and reinstalling it the only option?\n\nA: Nope! There is no need to reinstall Ubuntu!\nHere are the steps you need to take in order to add a new admin account:\nShutdown the computer.\nHold down the shift key and you will be greeted by the \"grub\" menu (it looks similar to the image below). Next, select the second option on the grub menu:\n\nOnce you selected the second option on the grub menu, you will see another menu with several recovery options:\n\nSelect the \"root\" option. then you will see a root terminal-prompt like this:\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nYou are going to have have to remount your Ubuntu partition to continue. At the prompt type: \nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nNext type (this will create the new admin account):\npasswd username\n\nNow it will prompt you to type in a new password:\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\n\nThis is how the results should look like:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nroot@ubuntu:~#\n\nNext, reboot the computer by typing:\nshutdown -r now\n\nOr, if you want to just change your standard account into an admin account type: \nadduser username sudo\n\nYou should now see a message saying 'adding user' followed by another one saying: \"done\".\nReboot by typing:\nshutdown -r now\n\nI hope this fixes your problem.

It's showing that I have an Intel Haswell Mobile when I actually have a NVIDIA Geforce gt 730 and Intel graphics 4600. I tried installing NVIDIA drivers before, but got a black screen on restart.\n\nA: Add the graphics drivers ppa and try the different nvidia drivers till you find the one that works. When I had that setup it was nvidia-358\n\nA: Running nvidia and an intel card requires you to take advantage of nVidia optimus, which might be on that card. (I don't know for sure) If you're installed off of stock, you'll run nouveau and need to fix a few things.\nAs a sidenote - I've had tremendous difficulty with 16.04 and nvidia cards - which is disappointing since the graphics drivers ppa for the GTX 1080 requires 16.04 and the 367 graphics package, as of this post.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold shift and boot your computer\n\n*When you get to the grub prompt, highlight ubuntu and press \"E\".\n\n*Add to the line starting with linux: \" nouveau.modeset=0\"\n\n*Press F10 to boot to console\n\n*Run these commands: (((DISCLAIMER: BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM FIRST)))\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340 nvidia-prime bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\n*If that doesn't work - you can try any other flavor of the drivers above 340, like 352, 361, or the meta-package nvidia-current.

I've installed Ubuntu onto my on-the-go laptop.  I end up sending and receiving mail often, and sometimes quite quickly with people replying immediately.  I have two accounts, one of which is my hotmail (outlook.com) account which I actually use most often and are IMAP connections.\nI've tried Geary, Claws, Evolution and now I'm using Thunderbird.\nThe problem here is that I want to be notified immediately when I get a new e-mail so that I can quickly reply, and I can receive quick replies right away without having to keep pressing \"Get messages\".\nOutlook.com does support push mail notification because I get it on my phone.  If I send myself an e-mail, I get instant notification on my phone.  However, this is no good when I'm roaming and my data is off, and working from a hotel room, or I'm working in an area that doesn't allow cell phones.\nI know that I can set Thunderbird to check every 1 minute, but sometimes I'm literally only online for 2 minutes reading, replying and reading e-mails.\ntl;dr\nHow can I get push mail on ANY Linux client?

Is it even possible to install Ubuntu if its not on there?\n\nA: Yes, the list of hardware with certified Ubuntu compatibility is not comprehensive. Linux and Ubuntu are meant to work on pretty much any PC but there's no guarantee for every available PC part. Especially new hardware often goes unsupported in Linux for a while (most manufacturers don't release Linux drivers so other people have to step in).\nThe manufacturers of the hardware simply decided to spend money and resources to thoroughly test it with Ubuntu and work together with the Linux developers and Canonical to assert that their hardware is most certainly compatible with Ubuntu.

I have recently installed Ubuntu in my laptop alongside Windows 10 by dual booting. And at the start grub is showing up to give options between Ubuntu os and Windows boot loader.\nIf I don't do anything for some time, Ubuntu gets selected automatically. Instead of Ubuntu I want Windows to get selected if I don't do anything. How can I do that?\n\nA: If you would like to have a graphical interface, you may want to use Grub Customizer:\nAs Tico pointed out, install it by adding the ppa first:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nThis tool lets you modify grub rather safely. It allows you to re-order grub's menu entries, set the default entry, and remove an entry, etc.\n\nA: To change the default loading entry, you need to change the GRUB_DEFAULT as given below.\nyou need to edit /etc/default/grub . To do that, \nExecute :  sudo nano /etc/default/grub\nNow change the GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to any entry you wish.\nThe first entry is 0 , second Entry is 1 and so on..\n\nAfter editing, update your grub by executing : sudo update-grub\n", "Q: Cannot boot my ubuntu after upgrade to 15.10 I cannot access  my computer using Ubuntu after upgrading to 15.10.If I attempt to access my files from recovery mode, it needs me to login and just shows #boot.

If not you can use Rufus (that unfortunately works only on Windows) to create your bootable usb drive with Ubuntu 16.04 iso and specify that it is a UEFI bootable drive and not the old BIOS bootable drive. This is the link for download rufus Link and this is a brief tutorial to use Rufus (remind to select to the field \"Partition scheme and target system type\" to UEFI and not BIOS)\nPS If you create the usb bootable drive with non-UEFI mode the pendrive will work only in legacy.\n\nA: I remember having a similar problem when trying to set up dual booting.

Thank you.\n\nA: That is SMART data that is used for drive self-diagnosis. You can find good explanation on how to interpret it here (take a look at the other answers too):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Value: This is the raw value that the controller reports. Usually it's an easy to understand value (like power on hours or temperature), but sometimes it isn't (like the read error rate). Different manufacturers can use different structures and meanings for this data.\n  \n*Normalized: This is the above value normalized so a higher value is always better. So a 114 in read/error rates is better than 113. Again, how your hard drive converts raw data to normalized value is vendor specific.\n  \n*Worst: The worst normalized value that your driver had in the past (where 99 is likely the factory setting).\n  \n*Threshold: When the normalized value is lower than this value the driver is likely to fail.\n  \n\nAs stated in the answer, normalized value should be above threshold value, and all the pre-fail attributes in your report seem to satisfy this condition.\nThe only suspicious attribute to me is End-to-End_Error whose  normalized value is close to its threshold value.\nBut according to this:\n\nThis is a critical parameter. Degradation of this parameter may indicate imminent drive failure. Urgent data backup and hardware replacement is recommended.\n\nYou shouldn't worry - End-to-End_Error threshold value is purposefully set high, since it seems to indicate very dangerous issues with HDD - all End-to-End_Error values are just the same on my 6 months old WD Black which never caused any problems.\nI have to note that the issue with re-spinning HDDs happened to me twice with two different HDDs - those HDDs now work fine, one got molex cable replaced and another got better external rack PSU - so it might be just an issue with power cabling or PSU.\nBut just in case, save this SMART report and rerun diagnostics after couple of weeks - just to check whether any pre-fail normalized value dropped - that might indicate worse problems than just power cabling issues.\nAlso, it would be great if you could test the drive on another PSU, just to make sure that it's providing enough juice - in my case, external rack didn't provide enough current on 12V rail and that was causing HDD to re-spin.\n", "Q: Any audio player with segment repeat?

You can go ahead directly and \n\n\n*\n\n*install the operating system from the iso file (or image file) or\n\n*restore the drive to a standard storage device\n\n\nA: It is found that the problem is due to a bug in usb-creator-gtk. It is setting improper block-size during the creation of bootable media.\nIf this bug affects you, you can mark it here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-creator/+bug/1589028\n\nA: This was much easier. Just replace /dev/sdd with your device address. This can be found in the Disks or Gparted utility.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=2048 count=32\n\nYou can then use Startup Disk Creator to burn the image to the drive.\n\nA: A command-line method to make a live USB for UEFI systems\nPlease note: this deletes all data on the target device.\nInstall prerequisite:\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\nAssuming the target USB is at /dev/sdb\n(please check first with lsblk or gnome-disks or sudo fdisk -l and be sure you know what you are formatting)\nMake sure the device has no mounted filesystem and unmount it if necessary, for example:\nudisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1\n\nDestroy existing partition table:\nsudo sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sdb\n\nCreate new GPT:\nsudo sgdisk --new=1:0:0 --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sdb\n\nFormat as FAT32:    \nsudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1\n\nCheck it:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb\n\nShould output something like:\nDevice     Start      End  Sectors  Size Type\n/dev/sdb1   2048 15663070 15661023  7.5G EFI System\n\nMount the drive and extract iso onto it, replacing 'name-of-iso' with the actual filename of the iso you downloaded earlier\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo 7z x name-of-iso -o/mnt/\n\nUnmount\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nNow reboot & enjoy Ubuntu ^_^\n(Here's where I originally learned to do this.)\n\nA: a problem that comes up with the chosen answer : The pen drive is now invisible upon inserting. (I'm on Lubuntu 16.04 64-bit)\nSolution: Open the Disks utility to mount it.\nIn Lubuntu: Start menu > Preferences > Disks.\n\nWhat has worked with the chosen answer, is that we're back to good old way of the USB drive getting the bootable ISO written to it and still remaining a writable USB drive with remaining space available to store other files (from another existing OS where we're not running the live OS). With Startup Disk Creatoras of 16.04, it is wiping out the USB, creating a read-only partition akin to a CD, making the remaining portion of the USB unallocated (so a 32GB drive becomes a 900mb read-only drive), and I wasn't able to create any secondary partition in the unallocated space.\nUpdate: Unetbootin seemed to do the job, the pen drive remained visible, didn't hide on inserting, and the remaining part of the disk remained available for storing other data. BUT the disk did NOT get recognized as a bootable USB when I booted my laptop! I used the Ubuntu version of UNetBootin.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, even on a brand new SSD. I used Linux Mint 18.1 and  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ISO versions. No matter how many times I redownloaded the ISO's, rewrote the ISO's and did all tthe steps suggested above to resolve the error mention, it just wouldn't go away. Strangely I did have Mint 18.1 installed and wanted to do fresh install but then encountered the error. \nI even used the same USB sticks & SSD to install Windows 10, then rewrote the same USB disks AGAION with Ubuntu 16.04/Mint 18.1 and install failed.\nMy opinion is that there was either fault with the ISO file or my particular hardware not compatible. \nI wasted several HOURS of my life.\n** SOLUTION: \nDownloaded Ubuntu 17.04 ISO & installed. Worked fine on the exact same hardware, same USB drives/sticks where Ubuntu 16.04 wouldn't have any of it.****\n\nA: Apparently the error lies with parted reading the drive incorrectly and not the dd command or the Startup Disk Creator program \nDebian Bug report for parted: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=788808\nWorkaround: If you use fdisk instead of parted then you will see the correct partitioning. Use fdisk instead of parted until the parted bug is fixed. \n\nA: It is a shame that many of these GUI disk utilities won't just allow you to delete the partition table off the USB, instead of just prompting with stupid errors like:\nPhysical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes\n\nThat error dialog should be coupled with this question:\nWould you like delete the partition table on this device (all data will be lost)?\n\nSince it doesn't do this, you can immediately do it yourself with this command:\nsudo sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sd?\n\nBe sure of two things before you do the command above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your terminal is logged into the computer you think it is.\n\n*Make sure the device path is correct (see the question mark in he\ncommand above,you need to change that to the correct device path).\n\n\nAs others have mention, you can figure out the device path with:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nAfter this, you can probably proceed by using the utility you were using when you got this error.\nBTW, the dd command solutions for this problem are too slow for my needs. All I really want to do is get rid of that error, without waiting on dd to zero out the whole drive.\n", "Q: Sync list of custom words in spell checker Is there a way to sync the list of custom words I added to the spell checking dictionary of firefox?\nI would like to sync this list to a different pc.\nIt would be even better if I could sync this to my android swype app.\nIs there a tool for this?\n\nA: For Firefox this is easy enough as your customised spelling words are stored in a plaintext file called persdict.dat. The full path will vary according to the filename used for the specific subdirectory, it will be something like $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/ using a wildcard for the random letters and numbers; but this screenshot will give you the idea:\n\nSimply copy this file to another profile, in the appropriate location, for the custom dictionary to be reused. If you would like you can also manually add words to this file using your favorite text editor.\nFor Swype I believe there is no easy way unfortunately. The contents of the file persdict.dat can be read with a text editor and then manually entered into Swype:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type a word that is not in your dictionary (for instance, “Ubuntu”)\n\n*Tap on your word in the Word Choice List\n\n*Tap on the prompt that then appears to add your word\n\n\nThis word 'Ubuntu' is now added to your personal dictionary, a painfully manual process but effective nevertheless...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*MozillaZine: Dictionaries - Personal Dictionaries\n\n*Swype ios tips...\n", "Q: Desktop icons or menus not appear in ubuntu 16.04 lts After installing ubuntu 16.04lts I work for several weeks without an issue.But last time I install the compiz package in order to customize my desktop and to add some effects.So I add some effects like water drops,mouse pointer effects.I also enabled the box rotate(I can not exactly remember the name of that effect) but it was not activated.I have pressed the activating keys but no response.And then I removed the checkbox tick and switch off the laptop.Next time when I power on the laptop it goes to the login screen.Shows no issues,same as before but after I login I can see like a new cover of the wallpaper comes over the original desktop.I cannot see my icons,desktop menus or anything.ctrl+alt+f1 takes me to the virtual console only.I have removed the compiz package and reinstall the ubuntu desktop but non of this works.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: You need to reset the whole Unity since something got messed up.\nIn Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) type:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nAfter that:\nsetsid unity\n\nShould fix the whole thing.

If you have colors set up for grep, this should show the alias in red so you should be able to see if a command is listed but is not the full alias.\nFor the other way around, to list all commands from history that aliases are set to execute, you can run this instead:\nfor i in $(alias | sed 's/^.*=//g'); do history | egrep \"$i\"; done\n\n", "Q: Why do I receive Software Update notifications if there are no updates available? I keep receiving the following notification about new updates:\n\nIf I then run the Software Updater, however, I don't receive any of these updates on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nDoes someone have the same problem?\n\nA: If you run the new 'Ubuntu Software' application (same icon as the old 'Ubuntu Software Centre', i.e. a capital 'A') the you will see the updates. I'm not sure why 'Software Updater' (icon  is a circle with arrows) is out of sync but it is. I asked a related question \nhere\n\nA: The extra and outdated notification messages are a bug. This has been fixed in development and the update will be released for Ubuntu 16.04 soon, probably later this month (June 2016).\n\nA: It is possible that there is a distro update.

If I try to copy 400 GB of files onto a drive that only has 390 GB of free space, will I be warned at the beginning of the operation? Or will I find out at the very end, when the space has run out?\nI'm primarily interested in Nautilus, but I'd also be interested in Thunar, PCMan FM and Dolphin.\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with unity 7.4.0 (default) . These are my results :\nIn Nautilus , It shows warning before copying : \n\nSame with Thunar,\n\nBut no warning in pcmanfm, \n\nNo warning in In dolphin, even in the end!! it just stopps when it realized that there is not enough space. \n\nA: The other answers reported no warning from Dolphin. They thought that it was because it wasn't running in full KDE.\nEdit: @JonasCz gets a warning from Dolphin on KDE 5.\nI just tested it out on a Kubuntu 15.10 Live USB (KDE 5).\nI copied a 2 GB zero file (created by dd) to a 950 MB USB drive.\nStrangely, Dolphin refused to copy the file at all. No error message. Nothing in the command line. Same when run as root.\nI even tested with kioclient, KDE's backend for filesystem operations (kioclient copy /test_2gb /media/kubuntu/test_2gb). Immediately exited, no message.\nCopying a small file (4 KB), which was within the space limit is fine.\nThe reason why Dolphin even tried to copy on other DEs is probably because it doesn't use kioclient, but something else.\nPossibly related to this bug (still unfixed, reported in 2008): KDE Bugtracker issue #162211.\n\nA: This is my experience with Gnome 3.18, it would seem to vary based on desktop environment, i.e. Nautilus does on Gnome and Dolphin does on KDE but not the other way round, best bet is use the file manager that came with your desktop.\nWith Nautilus, it will warn you first, here is the exact message\n\nFor Dolphin, the answer was no, it tried to copy a file larger than the destination, to the destination, it did not even warn me, just stopped as if it had finished, even left the broken file in the folder.\nThunar did warn me first, here is the message\n\nPCman FM did not warn me and the same as Dolphin, just left the broken file on the drive, no error messages.\n", "Q: Limit to bash script execution time with interactivity? I typically record my steps when deploying systems, and I often will duplicate the server during its initial testing.  For example, if I get a little too far in the weeds while I'm testing, I simply prefer to scratch the server after I get  success.  So easily enough I can get back to that point minus the extra steps I previously took that were unnecessary.  I can't sleep right if I feel like I have unnecessary dependencies sitting around.\nI haven't ran into a limit yet, but is there a point where BASH will give up on me waiting for me to finish.

However, this setting would affect the position of the launcher on both screens, and I want to keep the launcher on the left edge of my main monitor.\nHow can I configure unity to use different launcher positions on different monitors?\nAn alternate solution would be to have the unity launcher on the off monitor auto-hide, but I want to keep the launcher bar static on my main monitor.

One on the left-hand side, and one at the bottom of the screen?\nSee this article for a mechanism of using an alternate Launcher (Cairo Dock):\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/202708/how-to-convert-the-unity-launcher-into-a-dock-style-launcher/\nI have tested this (14.04 LTS) and can confirm installing Unity Tweak Tool and Cairo Dock would provide you with two (hidden, if you so choose) Launchers on both screens - one (Unity Launcher) on the left-hand side, and another (Cairo Dock) at the bottom of the screen.\nFrom my assessment of your needs, this would meet both but would mean having running two Launchers on both screens so you can choose which to use when it suits you.\nCairo-Dock allows you, if you have multiple monitors, to manage the location of the Dock/Launcher so that it appears in a specific location on only one monitors by leveraging features in Xinerama.\nI do not think this would provide significant benefits if the Dock/Launcher is always auto-hidden, however it might provide you some flexibility and potentially a solution that I can't think of... :)\nSee here for option: https://glx-dock.org/bg_topic.php?t=5632\n", "Q: Surges in fan speed on Lenovo ThinkPad I am using Kubuntu with Ubuntu 14.04 and KDE 4.13.3 on a Lenovo Thinkpad (more specific spec below).\nSince some time now I am getting extreme surges in fan speed that drop off immediately after.\nMost of the time theses peaks in fan speed arise every couple of minutes.\nThis even happens when completely idle.\nWhen under heavy load the intervals narrow, but the CPU fan speed is still pulsing up and down.\nI captured some data on this using Psensor which might illustrate the problem:\nIdle behavior\nFan speed (green), CPU temp (blue):\n\nHeavy load\nSix Cores running on 100% running infinite loops in python; Fan speed (green), CPU temp (blue).\nHeavy load interval is marked with a red circle:\n\nThis overshoots in the fan speed create a really unpleasant soundscape.\nIs there a way to prevent these peaks from happening?\nI would prefer a solution that works without any additional software,\nbut I am up for anything.\nEdit:\nI tried changing the Adaptive Thermal Management Scheme to Balanced, as suggested in this similar question, but this did not solve my problem.

You could try changing the power management profile to balanced.\nI do not recommend removing dust by using an air duster to blow the dust into the laptop. It is much safer to use a domestic vacuum cleaner to suck dust out, although this is nothing like as effective at cleaning the fan as disassembly and using something like a glass cleaning wipe on the fan blades.\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 does not shown up on Grub2, even after installing Boot Repair. - Ubuntu 16.04 This is my first time installing Ubuntu 16.04. I have Windows 8 on my PC, and I downloaded Ubuntu 16.04, put it on a DVD then installed it on my PC.\nWhen I turned on my PC after installing Ubuntu 16.04, no GNU Grub appeared. No option to choose Ubuntu or Windows. It directly booted-up Ubuntu 16.04.\nI searched for an answer. I followed suggestion by installing Boot Repair.\n\n\n\nopen a new Terminal, then type:\n      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n          Press Enter\n          Then type:\n      sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n          Press Enter\n\n\n\nNow, GNU Grub shown up. But no option for Windows. It's just:\n\nUbuntu\n  Advance Options for Ubuntu\n\nNow I do not know what to do. I need to work and access my document on windows 8.\n\nA: Maybe you accidentally have chosen the option the use the whole disk for Ubuntu when you started the installer. In this case the whole disk was wiped and Windows with all data is gone. There is a slightly chance that this did not happen and something went wrong when it came to the configuration of the GRUB boot loader. Open a terminal in Ubuntu, execute this command : sudo update-grub. Reboot and check whether you find the Windows entry in the boot menu.  \nAdditionally you can check the content of the disk with the Disks application, which is included in Ubuntu. Open Disks and check whether you can see more partitions than Linux and Swap. If this is the case reinstall the boot loader : sudo grub-install /dev/sd*, replace * with the drive letter of the disk where the systems are installed, in most cases this is the first disk sda. Afterwards update the GRUB configuration as it was described before : sudo update-grub.\n\nA: Turn off boot repair. Reboot to save changes. Then once you reach the login screen, shutdown. Turn on the computer, and hold down the shift key while it boots up. You will be greeted by the grub menu:\n\nWindows 8.1 should be a boot option in the grub menu. If it is one of the options available, select Windows 8.1. That's it, you should be able to boot into Windows 8.1 via the grub menu.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: Simply restart your OS. When it boots up hold down the shift key (or down-arrow), if you hit enter on Advance Option for Ubuntu you will still get the grub menu, here go to (recovery mode)\nThere you are supposed to get an option to repair/recover grub menu.\nYou can try by selecting each options got there by restarting again.\nHope it helps to resolve your issues.\n", "Q: initramfs won't load radeon after blacklisting it in modprobe.d I followed the solution to this question: pci-stub not claiming radeon card, only the audio device, radeon driver claiming graphics instead\nNow PCI_stub is claiming the devices (video and audio of my HD7970) properly, but as I have two AMD GPUs, I need the Radeon driver loaded, but this is not happening.\nI can not find a solution as google is mostly pointing at the thread mentioned above and other threads are pretty old or for other linux distros.\nAny idea what to do?

I'm in a similar situation to the one d3vid was in. I'm trying to reformat my SD card because I believe that's what's making it so hard for my computer to recognize it. Gnome Disk Utility recognizes the SD card but every time I try to format the card it returns a new error. I ran ls -la /dev/sd* before and after inserting the card and there was no difference between the outputs. It's like some parts of the computer can recognize the card and others can't...\nWhen I tried to format it as FAT without overwriting the contents disk utility gave the error Error creating file system: Command-line 'mkfs.vfat -I -n \"RASP\" \"/dev/mmcblk0\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1:\nstdout: 'mkfs.fat 3.0.28 (2015-05-16)\n'\nstderr: 'mkfs.vfat: failed whilst writing reserved sector\n' (udisks-error-quark, 0)\nWhen I tried overwriting the contents first it gave:\nError erasing device: Error writing 1048576 bytes to /dev/mmcblk0: Input/output error (udisks-error-quark, 0)\nlsblk showed the disk. sudo blkid did not. How can I wipe or format it?\n\nA: You should be using device mmcblk0p1 (partition 1) on the device to format.  By now, you probably have wiped out the partition table, so first thing, use a disk utility to put a new partition table on it with one partition.  Then you can mount that partition (not the whole device) and format it.  \n\nThe mkfs.vfat -I  command does not make a partition, it just forces the creation of the filesystem as specified on the whole device.  Without the -I, you'd get the error (paraphrasing): \"you really don't want to do this\".  Now the error you get about writing a reserved sector may be a complaint about putting a filesystem over the partition table (sector 0?).  I could do this on an old card I had, but maybe your card is smarter and rejects such actions.  \nWhile such actions as writing to the device instead of a partition on the device should be allowed, It looks like in your case, you have found something which prevents it.  OK, so just do things the expected way and put a partition table on the device, make a partiton, and format it FAT.  \n", "Q: How to allow moving the cursor while typing with xserver-xorg-input-libinput installed?

The mobile version of this chipset has no fan control outputs so you do not have the necessary hardware for software fan control under any operating system.\nYour fan speed is controlled by your BIOS. It sounds like it is working as intended as 50 degrees Celsius is a normal temperature for a laptop CPU.

I would like to standardize my video collection on a specific video codec (for instance the x265 High Efficiency Video Codec). I know I can obtain the codec in use from a single file using for instance 'mediainfo filename | grep \"Codec ID\"' Which will output the video codec followed by the audio codec for each file like:\nCodec ID                                 : V_VP8\nCodec ID                                 : A_VORBIS\n\nI've reviewed man find but I can't seem to figure out how to accomplish this. Any ideas?\n\nA: A combination of find, ffprobe, jq utilities could be used to print info about all *.avi, *.mp4 files (in the current directory tree recursively) that are NOT encoded using \"h264\" video codec:\n$ find -name \\*.avi -o -name \\*.mp4 \\\n    -exec ffprobe -v quiet -show_streams -show_format -of json {} \\; |\n  jq -c '.format.filename as $path |\n         .streams[]? |\n         select(.codec_type==\"video\" and .codec_name!=\"h264\") |\n         {codec: .codec_name, path: $path}'\n\nTo install the utilities, run:\n$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg jq findutils\n\nThe example works on jq 1.4. If apt-get version provides an older version; you could download a newer jq binary (just put the downloaded file somewhere in $PATH, rename it to jq and make it executable: chmod +x jq).\n\nA: You can get a sorted list of your codec specific media files under the working directory by\n$ mediainfo * | grep -v codec_id | grep .file_extension | cut -f2 -d: > list.txt\nwhere codec_id is the codec in question (ex. h264) and file_extension is the extension of the container in question (ex. .mkv)\nbut if the file names have blank spaces between names then the command will not work as desired.\n\nA: You can use this small python script together with find to print all files with specific codec:\nfilterByCodec.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport json\n\ninputPath = sys.argv[1]\ncodec = sys.argv[2]\ntype = sys.argv[3]\n\ncmd = 'ffprobe -v quiet -show_streams -print_format json ' + inputPath\noutput = os.popen(cmd).read()\noutput = json.loads(output)\n\nif not 'streams' in output:\n    sys.exit(0)\nfor stream in output['streams']:\n    if stream['codec_name'] == codec and stream['codec_type'] == type:\n        print inputPath\n        sys.exit(0)\n\nThis will call ffprobe, store its output in json string, iterate over all streams and print the input path in case codec name and type match. You will need ffprobe for this. You can get it as a static build from here if you don't have it installed on your system.\nThen you can call it on every file using find like this:\nfind . -type f -exec python filterByCodec.py {} hevc video \\;\n\nthis will print all videos containing HEVC video codec. More examples:\nfind . -type f -exec python filterByCodec.py {} h264 video \\;\nfind . -type f -exec python filterByCodec.py {} mp3 audio \\; \n\nYou can extend the script and move those files into some directory or whatever. This could look something like this: \ncmd = 'mv ' + inputPath + ' onlyhevcDir'\nos.system(cmd)\n\nI know that this is not the best way to do it, but using python it's pretty simple to do.\n", "Q: I can only launch gvim from the terminal and not from the Unity launcher I installed vim-gnome and it works great when I launch from the terminal with gvim command.

This article will walk you through configuring SSH so that the intermediate step is transparent.\nExample Network\nFor our example, we're going to use the network pictured below:\n\nExample network diagram\nFrom your computer at home you wish to log in to the host called 'tongariro' on the LAN at your office. All connections into the office LAN must pass through the firewall host 'aoraki'. The firewall host will only accept connections from the bastion host 'ruapehu'.\nDoing It Manually\nThese are the steps we plan to automate:\nTo connect to 'tongariro' you must first ssh to 'ruapehu'. Because you're connecting over the internet, you'll need to specify the full domain name when you connect. You'll also want to use '-A' to enable 'agent forwarding' (discussed below):\nssh -A ruapehu.example.com\n\nNow that you're logged in to a shell prompt on 'ruapehu', you'll need to connect to 'aoraki'. To allow password-less logins you'll have installed the public key from your home computer into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of each host along the way. When you execute the following command, the SSH server on 'aoraki' will request a key, this request will be forwarded back through 'ruapehu' to the agent running on your home computer and access will be granted:\nssh -A aoraki\n\nFinally, you can connect to the target host 'tongariro':\nssh -A tongariro\n\nQuick and Dirty Automation\nThe manual steps outlined above use three chained SSH connections to pass through two intermediate hosts. You can chain the three commands together into one monster command-line (perhaps in a shell script or a shell alias):\nssh -A -t ruapehu.example.com ssh -A -t aoraki ssh -A tongariro\n\nIn addition to the -A to enable agent forwarding, I've added -t to force a pseudo-tty to be allocated. Normally when your ssh command specifies a command to be run on the target host, no pseudo-tty will be allocated. That's fine if you want the command to run and then exit, but if you want an interactive shell session then you'll need a pseudo-tty.\nQuick and Dirty Automation with SSHMenu\nYou could assign that same monster command-line to a host connection on your SSHMenu:\n\nSSHMenu host dialog\nA Better Way\nAnother way to automate the connections through the intermediate hosts is to add a 'ProxyCommand' setting to your SSH config file. For this to work, you must have the 'netcat' package installed on the intermediate hosts.\nStart by editing your SSH config file (which might not exist yet):\ngedit ~/.ssh/config\n\nAnd add the following lines:\nHost ruapehu\n  HostName ruapehu.example.com\n\nHost aoraki\n  ProxyCommand ssh -q ruapehu nc -q0 aoraki 22\n\nHost tongariro\n  ProxyCommand ssh -q aoraki nc -q0 %h 22\n\nThe first entry defines a hostname alias so that you can ssh to 'ruapehu' instead of having to type 'ruapehu.example.com'.\nThe second entry sets up a proxy command that will be used to connect to the 'aoraki' host. Normally ssh establishes its own TCP connection to port 22 on the target host, but with this setting in place it will use the proxy command to establish the connection. The proxy command in the example will establish a normal SSH connection to the intermediate host ('ruapehu') and then use the 'nc' command to extend the connection to port 22 on 'aoraki'.\nNow that the proxy command is set up, you can connect to the 'aoraki' host simply by typing:\nssh aoraki\n\nThe third entry builds on this by using the newly accessible 'aoraki' host in a proxy command which extends the connection to our ultimate target 'tongariro'. Note that in this command, '%h' was used for the hostname. This is simply a shorthand that tells SSH to insert the target hostname (from the line above) in place of the %h. If you want to connect to other hosts on the office LAN you can duplicate the last two lines and just change the hostname in one place.\nSo Why is this Better?\nWith the above configuration in place, you can now SSH directly to the 'tongariro' host with this command:\nssh tongariro\n\nYou can copy files directly to (or from) 'tongariro' without having to worry about intermediate steps:\nscp path/to/local/file tongariro:path/to/remote/file\n\nYou can enable X-forwarding which means that any GUI program you start on 'tongariro' will display on your workstation:\nssh -X tongariro xclock\n\nGUI application performance will be sluggish over slow network connections but some GUI apps on your local machine will now be able to use SSH to talk to the remote host. For example if you're running GNOME, you can use an 'ssh' URL in Nautilus to browse files on the remote host. (KDE provides equivalent functionality):\n\nSSHMenu host dialog\nIf you right click a file and select \"Open with Text Editor\", the GNOME Text Editor program will run on your local machine but will use SSH to read/write the file to the remote host.\nFor an even more powerful approach to editing files over an SSH connection, you might like to look into bcvi.\nMany other familiar tools will also be able to use the transparent SSH connections. For example you can access version control repositories (CVS, Subversion, Git etc) over SSH. You can also use port-forwarding on the SSH conection to access intranet servers or HTTP proxies on the office LAN from your workstation.\nReusing Connections\nThe transparent multi-hop connections can be very useful but you may find that it takes a second or two to establish each connection. This delay can become annoying if it happens a lot (e.g.: every time you save a file from the text editor).\nThe good news is that if you can configure SSH to reuse an existing connection. This means that for example if you have an SSH shell session running then a new connection for SCP can skip the connection setup phase. Two steps are required:\nFirst, you must create a directory (or 'folder') which SSH will use to keep track of established connections:\nmkdir ~/.ssh/tmp\n\nNext, add these two lines at the start of your ~/.ssh/config (make sure to use your username in place of 'YOUR-NAME'):\nControlMaster auto\nControlPath   /home/YOUR-NAME/.ssh/tmp/%h_%p_%r\n\nAs you can see, a small investment in time setting up your SSH configuration can pay back dividends in convenience.\n", "Q: What are the dangers of using an unsupported Ubuntu version? Non-LTS versions of Ubuntu only receive security updates for up to 9 months after their release (for Ubuntu 15.10, until 07/2016) and are not recommended for use after the expiration of the support.\nWould there be an imminent threat for a user, who is generally careful (not adding third-party repositories, using a web browser without JavaScript/NoScript, not executing unknown files/commands, active software firewall) in continuing to run an unsupported version for a few more months (e.g. 3-4 additional months until the release of the next equal month-version, such as .10 to .10)?\nIf yes, what would be the most likely causes of a security breach?\n\nA: You would be safe from viruses and malware, since anti-virus software is 3rd party and you would still be able to update them since the companies that made the software will keep providing you with new virus definitions. \nBut....There are a lot of Linux black-hats out there who would just love to hack into your computer. And because Canonical will no longer give you security updates, your computer will be rendered vulnerable. (Kind of like when MS pulled the plug on Windows XP). I think that programs such as Java and ssh would be targeted to gain full access to your computer. But as long as you harden down your computer, I guess you would be fine for a few months or more after the version no longer becomes supported. \n\nA: My question would be a what is the upside? You cannot upgrade from 15.10 to 16.10 directly. If the upgrade is something you don't want to do because you are afraid of maybe breaking something, the LTS version would be the better option due to its longer support.\nBut as the others wrote, as long as you are careful and don't run services (or even better create your own debs (backports) from the newer releases when there is a problem), you might be fine. Consider using a ppa for the browser to get security fixes at least there. \nI guess this comes from some kind of necessity, but if not, never plan to do it like this! \n", "Q: Unable to find packagename 'xenial-proposed' \n*\n\n*setup: Ubuntu 16.04lts on vmware exsi vm as guest os.\n\n*procedure: installing openstack following url http://conjure-up.io/\n\n*installation issue: unbound local error; following instructions at\nTesting/EnableProposed (ubuntu wiki). \n\n*using the following command to upgrade xenial-proposed as item 3: \nsudo apt-get install packagename/xenial-proposed\n\n*getting error as shown in screen shot attached:\n\n\n\nPlease help suggest.\n\nA: There is no package named 'xenial/proposed', however there is a repository called that name.\nNote: enabling the repository xenial/proposed is not really encuraged because it contains bleeding edge developtment packages which may even be able to break your setup\nTo easily enable all the repositories you can change your /etc/apt/sources.list by:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAnd the following section is a compressed enable all repositories sources.list you can copy&paste or change your sources.list to look alike:\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 16.04 LTS _Xenial Xerus_ - Release amd64 (20160420.1)]/ xenial main restricted\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner\ndeb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu xenial partner\n\nAfter done this edit, simply do an sudo apt-get update to cache the new enabled repositories, from there you can install whatever you need.\n", "Q: Can't install CUDA on Ubuntu due to Nouveau - how can I disable / uninstall?

I have 5,000 images which I need to compress (to display on my website).\nI am new to Ubuntu. So what do I do?\n\nA: The \"compression\" word seems to be misinterpreted in this question, but it's yet valid depending on the context you wish to see this.\nThe scenery\nLet's face that Web designers, Web developers and/or Web masters need to \"compress\" our image files in order to make them enough \"lightweight\" to be quickly uploaded to our hosting if we're working directly on a real production environment. Which won't affect if we were working in a local testing production environment.\nMany of the answers seems to refer to other things, mostly caused because of -probably- they haven't faced such scenery. That's why I start explaining this.\nSo. Let's understand what the answer need to solve:\n\n\n*\n\n*The picture MUST be lightweight\n\n*The picture MUST be \"compressed\" in order to lose file size but not \"rezised\" as refered by another user who pointed to a duplicated on this question JPG batch compression & rename (find -exec, xargs, piping?) \n\n*The pictures should be batch compressed, preferably via a GUI.\n\n\nLightweight Picture\nLet's first understand what a \"lightweight picture\" should be.\nHigh Definition Pictures, with resolutions over 1024px may have a big file size. I provide an example on this screenshot:\n\n\nIn the file properties window we can see this is a 9.5 MB file, which will delay a lot to upload and will delay a lot in order to render on screen when published in a website.\nNevertheless, the image size and grid resolution is really useful for a high definition printing. So that's a different scenery which I won't cover in this explanation.\nSo, how can I use this image in a website, without waiting years in order to upload and waiting some other years in order to show it in my website?\nThe file should be compressed.\nAnd when we talk about \"compression\" we explicitly need to change it's quality in order to make it usable for the case we are facing.\nSo, let's drop the next in a terminal:\nconvert seminario-tabloide.png test.jpg\n\nThis is going to convert the high definition PNG format into a \"compressed\" JPG format, which by itself is a smaller file! It goes from 9.5 MB to 2.4 MB.\n\nYet Big?\nBut, 2.4 MB is yet a big file size. Let's now play with some other ImageMagick convert commands in order to create smaller file sizes:\nconvert test.jpg -quality 50% test-50p.jpg\n\nThis is what we need to do in order to \"compress\" an image. This is going to reduce the image's quality by 50% and deliver a 938.4 KB <=== (Note: KILOBYTES, not even a Megabyte) filesize.\nWe can go further and create a smaller file size by adjusting the percentage in the same command via:\nconvert test.jpg -quality 30% test-30p.jpg\n\nPlease have in mind that in this example we're reducing the quality of the file, not the image dimensions. Which will result in a compressed file that it's not visually affected when rendered on screen, but you will see the artifacts when printing in a big paper size (bigger than letter). \nResizing + Compressing = Super Cool!\nNow. We can do a different thing. A couple of things indeed: We can first resize the images and apply compression after that, which will result in a smaller file size than the original, and will deliver a useful image for rendering on screen, not so good for printing but it seems we need to display it on screen and not in a printed banner, right?\nSo let's do this:\nconvert seminario-tabloide.png -resize 1024x test-1024x.jpg\n\nWith this instruction, we are asking the image to be resized to be 1024 pixels wide by any amount of pixels needed in order not to lose aspect ratio. \nNow... guess what?\nThe file size reduced from 9.5 MB to... (suspense music with congas please) 433.7 KILOBYTES\nIf we wish to maximum compress a maximum compressed file like this, we'll face some overhead data inserted in the file and it will result in a bigger file size. So I won't suggest you to try but if you are expecting me to do the example, ok... Here we go!\nconvert test-1024x.jpg -quality 50% test-1024x-50p.jpg\n\nAnd we went from a 433.7 KB to a 176.2 KB in a single command. This example was successful, nevertheless don't expect any exercises to result in smaller file sizes. But you can have lots of fun when running this kind of exercises.\nBatch process\nOh! But I almost forget one of the needs: To apply this process to lots of pictures with ease.\nFor such thing we can do it with two processes.\nThe terminal\nThis is faster, and easier. So let's tell the terminal we need to run the same instruction in all the files in a directory, after which I'll explain other instruction.\nConvert all to 1024px (you can use any pixels amount)\nfor i in *; do convert $i -resize 1024x $i-1024x.jpg; done;\n\nHere we're asking the command to run the same instruction for all the files in a directory, apply the transformation and drop a copy with a different name in order to make it easy to select.\nReduce quality by percentage (use any percentage you may wish) to all the pictures in a directory:\nfor i in *-1024x.jpg; do convert $i -quality 50% $i-50p.jpg; done;\n\nHere we are asking the resized images to be reduced in quality in order to make its filesize smaller.\nYou can play with these commands and see your results. After a couple of hours having fun you will be an expert.\nNautilus Script\nOn April 20, 2015 I faced such situation as the original question, so I had to do some research and ask for help on a question. That's why now I know a lot of this. Don't think I borned with this knowledge, man.\nIf you're not used to terminals and/or wish to use a GUI in order to simply choose your groups of files and apply the transformations, you can create your own Nautilus Actions Script in order to simply right click the group of files and choose an option from the context menu. \nFor instructions on how to do such thing please read both the question, answer and comments here: How to batch process JPG images to change its quality with Nautilus-Actions? \nGood luck!\n\nA: I use Trimage super simple to use.\nonly add picture and it compress \nto install :\nsudo apt-get install trimage\n\n\n\nA: just for .png compress\n// test with software screenshot img\nX. test results first\n 146K  redis_insight.png    //orig screenshot\n 102K  redis_insight-1.png  //optipng compress\n  38K  redis_insight-2.png  //pngquant compress\n\n 135K  resp_app_tree.png\n  96K  resp_app_tree-1.png\n  47K  resp_app_tree-2.png\n\n  88K  redis-commander_tree2.png\n  63K  redis-commander_tree2-1.png\n  27K  redis-commander_tree2-2.png\n\n  61K  redsmin_tree.png\n  44K  redsmin_tree-1.png\n  22K  redsmin_tree-2.png\n\nCarefully compare the result images, naked eye is almost indistinguishable.\n1. optipng //lossless compression\n$ optipng redis_insight.png -out redis_insight-1.png\n\n//more compress level\n$ optipng -o5 -strip all redis_insight.png -out redis_insight-1.png\n\n2. pngquant //lossy compression\n$ pngquant --speed 1 redis_insight.png -o redis_insight-2.png\n\n--\n\nref: https://www.systutorials.com/compressing-png-images-on-linux/\n\nA: You could use squoosh-cli.

The website has a really cool before/after preview. I would recommend using the website on a single image to find good settings, then use the CLI to compress in bulk.\n\nA: The simple way to do it in Ubuntu command line is using ImageMagick.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ImageMagick using the command sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n*Navigate to the directory containing the images.\n\n*Run the command mogrify -quality 75% *\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The complete list of commands for mogrify can be found here.\n\n*This command will replace the old images. So it is advisable to take a backup, just in case.\n\n\nA: The other solutions did not work for me. So I found a new approach:\nAt first, convert .png or any other format to .jpg using this command(you must have ImageMagick on your OS):\nconvert file_name.png file_name.jpg\n\nThen use Jpegoptim to fit the size you need:\njpegoptim -v --size=240k file_name.jpg\n\n\nA: If you are referring to jpeg images, de facto compression is not possible. Because jpeg is by definition a compressed file format (all noise and useless pixels are already removed). You can zip them alright, but the total size will remain about the same. The only advanced compression algorithm i know for jpegs is zipx. But zipx is proprietary by Winzip and ensures a max. size cut by 30% (in zipx archive mode).    \nTo display your images on the web, first you should resize them (under 1MB per each one) and optionally convert them to png file format. PNG(=portable network graphics) is specially optimized for faster web transfer and faster display. Advanced users may even convert those images to webp format (Google's format for pictures, fastest loading algorithm). \nYou can batch convert pictures with XnConvert,then batch resize your pictures with XnView. Download the deb package from here: http://www.xnview.com/de/xnviewmp/#downloads , then right-click on it and open it with Gnome Software.  \nIf you don't care about network loading speed, but care about quality, you should keep your images untouched and create a digital library for them. Maybe upload them onto a public server (Yahoo, Google, etc).\n\nA: Better compressed result is with optipng ref\n# install `$ sudo apt-get install -y optipng`\n# see helpful syntax `$ tldr optipng`  # you may need install tldr `sudo apt-get install -y tldr`\noptipng \\       \n    -o7         `# use best compression but quite slow ref. tldr optipng - fastest is w/ -o0` \\\n    -strip all  `# remove all metadata ref. tldr optipng` \\\n    *           `# all files or enter /path/to/your.png`\n\n", "Q: Reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04.1 over 14.04.3 - Did I delete my windows partition?

Thus, they suggested I run the command sudo modprobe -r acer-wmi followed by sudo rfkill unblock all followed by sudo \"blacklist acer-wmi\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, and I was/am up and running. Big thanks to everyone who helped me, and if you are looking for an explanation of what was going on, check chili555's answer down below. Thanks again!\n\nA: I suspect that you have an HP laptop and not an Acer. Let's remove the acer_wmi module and see if the soft block is resolved.\nsudo modprobe -r acer-wmi\nsudo rfkill unblock all\n\nNow is your wireless working? If so, let's blacklist acer-wmi:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist acer-wmi\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nNow, let's install newer firmware:\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_1.158_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-firmware*.deb\n\nReboot and your wireless should be working correctly.\nEXPLANATION: Laptops need a small helper module to translate key presses into action; in your case, to turn on the wireless. Your HP laptop incorrectly loaded both hp-wmi and acer-wmi. Your symptom was this:\n\nThe second entry (1, if you are counting =P ) was \"acer-wireless\" and\n  was soft blocked (but not hardblocked).\n\nI suggested that you unload the module, sudo modprobe -r acer-wmi (-r for 'remove') and, if your wireless was working, to blacklist the module so that it doesn't again incorrectly reload on reboot.\nThe improved firmware, while probably helpful, had nothing to do with the soft-block.\n", "Q: Rare Full Partition Behaviour Yesterday, I had my main Linux partition more than 60% free.\nToday, I tried to upgrade the system (as usual, each day) and it tells me: There is not enough room to perform the upgrading.

Said bad Filename. Soo how can I perform a factory reset without a disc or a USB?\nIt was just sitting in a closet before I opened it up, so I don't see much reason it is acting like that. There is no external damage that is visible. The os is Linux, don't know what version because It was given to me by a friend. Also if there is any way to recover Linux, I'm fine with that too.\n\nA: In grub you can get a list of devices by typing \"ls\" with no argument at the grub prompt. A common mistake is to leave out the brackets. You can get a list of partitions by listing just the device from the list but you still must include the parentheses (round brackets). In grub drives and partitions are named in brackets and use a different naming convention. During boot disks are mapped to device files in dev. In grub that has yet to happen.\nList partitions on the first disk:\nls (HD0)\nThe first disk and first partition usually is \nls (HD0,1)\nls (HD0,MSDOS1) \nor \nls (HD0,GPT1)\nAnd for a usb key\nls (USB0)\nThe disk numbering starts at 0 but the partition numbering starts at 1. This will be the first partition in the partition table which does not always map to disk geometry. With traditional msdos partition tables you also will have a primary partition that contains additional logical partitions. For these you will have another parameter in the parentheses. This will be evident when you LS the primary partition.\nIf you get a grub prompt but the computer is not booting to linux there is a good chance that when upgrading the computer someone reinstalled another version of linux and put the bootloader in a partition rather than the MBR but left the old grub in the MBR. You are running that old grub which points to an installation that was deleted. You could read how to chainload grub if this is the case or get the boot parameters from the grub configuration file and boot manual from this grub. However since there is not data you want to recover its best to reinstall. \nThe best way is to create a USB key. You must mark it bootable and the bios must be set to boot from USB key, but if you have problems with getting your computer to boot from a USB key but you can see it with \"ls\" then  you probably can chainload the bootloader on the key with grub, or even from an iso image file in a fliesystem on a usb drive, without the key prepared for automatic boot. \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot\n(quoted from that page)\n\no mount an ISO via the GRUB terminal, determine the location/path of\n  the ISO file, then: \nloopback loop (hdX,Y)//\nExample: loopback loop (hd0,5)/my_isos/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nOnce mounted via the above command, the ISO can be inspected using the\n  ls command.

Let me suggest you also try to set it on the default port 9500 with\n# port for HTTP (descriptions, SOAP, media transfer) traffic\nport=9500\n\n\nA: Looks like you have several issues. Then main thing is your conf file is inconsistent. You have the media stored under /media/username123, the database under /home/user and the service running under the default user name which I believe is minidlna. The whole thing makes it very easy to get your permissions wrong.\nThe syslog error message is saying that it failed to open the database. That indicates eith a permission problem or sqlite is not installed. I'm assuming its installed and that you have a permission problem.\nI suggest that you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a username dedicated to minidlna ( I use \"minidlna\"). It is setup as an account that can't be logged onto;\n\n*Put your media files / directories under one directory ( I use /home/minidlna );\n\n*Set the ownership to minidlna:minidlna and the permissions to 660;\n\n*Change your conf file to reflect this new setup;\n\n*If you want to be able to access the media directories from a user account  put the appropriate username in the minidlna group.\n\n*I'm not sure if dlna will work if you change the port number, the clients have to be able to \"discover\" the port and IP address somehow and changing it from the default may cause a problem. I'd leave it on the default get everything working and once every one can see the server start playing around.\nWhen setting stuff up for the first time its best to leave as much as possible at default \"good\" values, get it working and then make one change at a time to get \"better\". Once you are experienced with it you will know what changes work and can do new setups all at once.\n\nA: I have a Samsung Smart TV, ZyXEL router, and Ubuntu server.\nWith only the Ubuntu server connected via wired connection, miniDLNA was not visible on any wireless device.\nVery interestingly, as soon as I connected my windows laptop to the router to debug (2nd Wired Connection to rounter), miniDLNA started working over WiFi automatically.\nI can't explain it, but it seems like a bridge between wired and wireless was created just by plugging in a second device to the wired network.\nHope that helps someone.\n", "Q: How to convert .odt to latex?

Thanks!\n\nA: Simple guide:\nYou can configure Squid for the following topology: the Ubuntu pc must have one NIC (wlan0) connected to the private LAN, and the other one (eth0) connected to the Internet.\nTo set up a transparent proxy with Squid, you must add necessary iptables rules. These rules should help you get started:\nexec sudo -i\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128\n\nThe first line will enable forwarding\nThe second line will cause all outbound packets from eth0 (WAN interface) to have the source IP address of eth0. \nThe third line will redirect all incoming HTTP packets (destined to TCP 80) from wlan0 (LAN interface) to Squid listening ort (TCP 3128), instead of forwarding it out to WAN interface right away.\nNow you start Squid installation and you will modify Squid configuration to turn it into a transparent proxy, you define our LAN subnet (e.g., 10.10.10.0/24) as a valid client network. Any traffic not originating from the LAN subnet will be denied access.\nsudo exec -i\napt-get update\napt-get install squid\nnano /etc/squid/squid.conf \n\nSimple example of basic content:\n## Hostname proxy example ##\nhttp_port 3128 transparent\n\n## Define our network ##\nacl our_network src 10.10.10.0/24\n\n## make sure that our network is allowed ##\nhttp_access allow our_network\n\n## finally deny everything else ##\nhttp_access deny all\n\nMore info:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-setup-transparent-proxy-squid-howto.html\nhttp://www.brennan.id.au/11-Squid_Web_Proxy.html\nhttps://www.garron.me/en/linux/iptables-manual.html\n\nA: You need to use the router as it is designed. I find that odd connections can drastically change the quality of your network and a stock Linksys' firmware isn't designed for really odd configurations.\nPlug your modem into the internet port on your linksys and configure the router to handle the connection. A factory reset may be needed if you have changed more that you remember and can change back.\nIf you are connecting your computer to the modem and then to the switch on the modem (the group of ports) then you need to change the gateway in your local settings on the router and in DHCP to match your computer's IP.

Do so by:\n# in case of your own .profile\necho \"PATH=\"/opt/<application-folder>:$PATH\"\" >> ~/.profile\n\n# in case of the other users .profile\necho \"PATH=\"/opt/<application-folder>:$PATH\"\" | sudo tee -a /home/<user-name>/.profile\n\n", "Q: Getting file name in hex or base64 Due to a question on Software Recommendations, I thought I could implement a program that parses the output of ls -l and displays the files in an Explorer like style. This approach was suggested on ServerFault. At the same time, other people discourage parsing ls.\nSo I wonder whether there's a way to list the file name in hexadecimal or base64 format which would bypass any special characters like \\n and similar.\n\nA: I am guessing that you want to display filenames along side their hexadecimal value.  In that case, here is a simple line of code to demonstrate that that is possible:\n$ touch abc 'd e f' \n$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec sh -c 'printf \"%-10s %s\\n\" \"$1\" \"$(printf \"$1\" | xxd -pu )\"' None {} \\;\n./abc      2e2f616263\n./d e f    2e2f6420652066\n\nThe idea is that for each file we find we run printf with a format string and two arguments.  The first argument is the file's name and the second is the file's name converted to hex with the utility xxd.\nFurther customization of the output is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nA: Well, call me a noob, but I tried John1024's suggestion and it gave me an error, so I tried figuring it out on my own. I made a file named readline.sh that contained the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfile=$1      # $1 contains the argument passed\n> line.txt   # create/empty line.txt\nIFS=$'\\n'    # set Internal Field Separator to '\\n'\nfor line in `cat $file`       # assign each line in $file to $line\ndo\n    echo $line >> line.txt    # print $line to line.txt\n\n    # this one's tricky because you need to pipe just the line\n    # (without a '\\n') into xxd and then print it to line.txt\n    echo `printf \"%s\" \"$line\" | xxd -p` >> line.txt\ndone\ncat line.txt     # we want to see the contents of line.txt now\n\nNow to run it I called ls | ./readline.sh and it output the following:\nbar\n626172\nbaz\n62617a\nfoo\n666f6f\nline.txt\n6c696e652e747874\nreadline.sh\n726561646c696e652e7368\n\nNow, I want to point out that this script doesn't have any way of checking that $1 even exists, and there's probably other issues with it, but, assuming I understand your question right, it seems the essence of the solution is to pipe the output of ls line by line into xxd -p. All the extra fluff was a) for me to make sure it worked before posting it and b) to show the principle in action.\n", "Q: Can't make cron open a Java program with a GUI I made a simple \"journal\" program that will open a GUI, prompt for an entry and a few factors, and print this information to a file under the current date. I've written a short bit of java code that does this when run, and I want to use cron to schedule it to run every day. \nI also wrote a small script (\"javashell.sh\") to change to the directory where I have the java code, compile it, and run the java program. Its contents are this:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /home/otolithic/Desktop/projects;\njavac Journal.java;\njava Journal;\n\n(Its so short as to feel pointless but I thought it would be necessary to easily run the program from cron; I'm totally new to Linux so let me know if this is weird or not)\nI put it in usr/local/bin so I can just type \"javashell.sh\" in the terminal and the journal app runs no problem. But when I try to make a cronjob out of this command, I can see in the logs that it's run but no GUI ever pops up to ask for a journal entry like it does when I just run javashell.sh outside of cron.\nI've tried (after the minute/hour/etc.):\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0 && javashell.sh\nDISPLAY=:0 javashell.sh\nenv DISPLAY=:0 javashell.sh\n$DISPLAY=:0 && javashell.sh\ncd ~/path/to/file && javac Journal.java && java Journal\nenv DISPLAY=:0 && cd ~/path/to/file && javac Journal.java && java Journal\n\nto no effect.\nI checked that my display is in fact :0 so the problem isn't that.

I installed pv so I could check progress of a usb installation, and I began the process with sudo dd if= | pv | of=/dev/sdb. \nWell, it's supposed to ask me for my sudo password, but when I pressed Enter, it started showing progress before I could enter the password. I went ahead and attempted to type the password, but it was mixed in with the progress text. \nSo, then I decided to do Ctrl+C to stop it. \nMy question is: Can I just do \"sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb\" to erase any data and start over? I JUST bought this drive today, so this is frustrating. I'm definitely not doing that again.\nThanks. \n\nA: If you will be writing another image onto it (Using dd or the graphical USB image writer included in Ubuntu, or some other tool), there is no need to erase anything first, just start over and write the new image directly onto it.\nIf you want to use it to store files, you can format it using the graphical \"Disks\" utility, again no need to erase anything first.\nHowever, overwriting the contents with sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb won't do any harm either, although i'd recommend using if=/dev/zero, since it may be faster.\n", "Q: How to disable upgrade/update of selective packages permanently? I read this Q&A about How to prevent updating of a specific package? \nBut, I would like to disable/prevent update of a lot of packages, how can I do this efficiently?\nThe above given method works( as shown in image below), but it's hard to find the names of packages that exactly apt-mark understands. See the screenshot below, I need to disable or put on hold all of these except a few. \nThe software updater pops up many times (I know i can skip it always), but I am on low bandwidth and can't update each and every package. And I hardly use them, e.g. Thunderbird, simple-scan, music player.\nIt would be very good, if this software-updater had a option to disable update of a package by just right-clicking or some other way.\n\n\nA: Finding package names\nOne way is to use apt-get dist-upgrade instead of the software updater GUI. It will generate almost the same list of packages, however, it will use their package names instead of their \"human friendly\" titles. This will allow you to run apt-mark on them.\nThat will at least make it easier.\nDoing it in bulk\nIf you want to do them all at once, you can save the packages to a text file called package_list, one package per line; then run\n$ sudo :; cat package_list | xargs sudo apt-mark hold\n\nxargs will take each line in turn and append it to the apt-mark command line. The first command, sudo :, simply caches your credentials so that you don't have to type your password when running sudo apt-mark several times; If you're running as root anyway, you won't need this, but it allows you to do as much as possible without elevated privileges.\nWarning\nI have not tested the xargs line. Besides, it's good practice to read and understand any command before running it; especially when using sudo/root. ;-)\nWhat can go wrong, and why\nI know you said you wanted to allow 2-3 packages to upgrade normally; but if you're not really careful, you can prevent a package from upgrading even without putting a hold on it directly, because if the newer version of your package depends on a newer version of another package which has a hold, neither can be upgraded without first removing the hold.\nSo, if you want to allow a specific package to update, ensure that all of its dependents have no holds, either. The list generated by an updater can be misleading, because it's usually a flat list of packages, without the dependency tree used to generate the list in the first place.\nHistory\nThe \"Software Updater GUI\" used to be a lot less polished — and a lot more useful, back in the bad ol' days when Ubuntu was still young. In fact, it used to show the package names along with the titles.\n\nA: From the old school GUI, there is an alternative package manager named \"synaptic\". That existed in Debian before Ubuntu existed.  I suggest you install that, it is in the Ubuntu repositories.  synaptic has a menu pulldown to lock a package in place. Click \"Package\" then choose \"Force Version\".\nI did not agree with initiative to replace synaptic in the way-back-when, for me it still works awesome.  I never use \"Software Updater GUI\", it makes me feel as though I've lost control of my computer.  apt-get in the command line is nice too. If you do that, then apt-mark, as suggested by @jpaugh, will work fine. \nGoing between programs, you'll notice some weird things.  Package settings in synaptic are not respected in \"Software updater\" and apt-get settings are separate as well. aptitude keeps its own database as well.  That's a little surprising to me, seems like one ought to be able to set those characteristics in the package database itself, rather than having each separate program maintain its own records.  But I think that's what happens.\nYou can regain control, I expect. Let us know if synaptic does what you want. \n", "Q: starting the laptop after sleep while using windows -- grub opens up instead I am currently dual booting Windows and Ubuntu.

Now that boot repair can't fix it for you, you need to fix it manually. Your boot-repair info shows three drives: sda, sdb and sdc. You need to find out where you installed ubuntu. If it's sda, be sure to use that for all the commands mentioned below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer from the Ubuntu DVD (of from a Live USB with Ubuntu on it). Select \"Try Ubuntu (without installing)\". Only use the DVD of the Ubuntu version that you wish to repair. So for 15.10, use the DVD of 15.10.\n\n*Now you need to find out what's the name (and the partition number) of the root partition (the partition on which your Ubuntu has been installed). Check this with the application Gparted Partition Editor. Gparted is present both on the Ubuntu DVD and on the Linux Mint DVD. \n\n\nTip: the root partition of your Ubuntu will usually be formatted in EXT4. The EFI partition wil probably be formatted in FAT32, and it'll have the boot flag. \nOn my computer, the Ubuntu root partition is called sda5. For the sake of clarity I'll use that situation in the rest of the how-to.\n\n\n*Launch a terminal window.\n\n*Copy/paste the following command line into the terminal (you can copy/paste with a right-click of the mouse): sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt \nNote: only if Ubuntu is on sda5! Change the number according to your situation. ....and press Enter. This mounts the Ubuntu root partition on the hard drive.\n\n*Copy/paste this command line into the terminal: sudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt\n....and press Enter. This installs Grub.\nNote: definitely use copy/paste and do not type this command by hand! Many people forget to type essential spaces in this command.\nNote: you might get the following harmless error report:\ngrub probe: error: failed to get canonical path of /cow\nInstallation finished. No error reported. This grub probe error is harmless, and all should be well.\n\n\n*Now type in the terminal: sudo reboot \n....and press Enter.\n\n\nThis should work!

Should be automatic even?  Just select \"Notify me of new Ubuntu Release\".... Not so easy.  I have had these repository errors for months and it seems they prevent the upgrade.  So I ended up removing all the third-party PPAs from my list. Still couldn't get the updater to automatically give me the option to upgrade.\nSo more reading I found the command: sudo do-release-upgrade\nWhich I typed into the terminal and it told me it would take 1 hour and 34 minutes.  Five hours later (including several pauses when I had to give it input for mySQL and Apache and I was AFK)... and I was staring at a blank screen.\nI obviously wasn't watching the whole upgrade process.

Just the desktop with my couple of shortcuts on it.\nAlso no WiFi enabled.\nBasically the upgrade has ruined everything... how do I save this?\n\nA: First things first: before you proceed with the following procedure you should make sure to backup your data, just in case. You can do this from the TTY.\nAfter thats out of the way lets try to rescue your system (in very worst case you might need to do a clean new install hence the backup). Start with checking your /etc/apt/sources.list if all links are consistent for wily.\nIf not lets replace that with a new sources.list file. To do that enter sudo su into the TTY console and then do the following lines one by one:\nwget -O- http://pastebin.com/raw/T544dTJE > /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThat will replace your sources list without you needing something to copy and paste. The next steps are doing an update to renew the cache.\napt-get update\n\nThen you now can try to repair maybe broken packages before continuing.\napt-get -f install\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nNow make an dist-upgrade to get all installed packages as far up to date as possible.\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAfter that you have to maybe reinstall the desktop environment. Do so with:\napt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will hopefully fix it far enough that you can either stay at 15.10 or proceed upgrading to 16.04, thats up to you.

However, it comes with an integrated AMD GPU, that I never installed the driver for. The consequence of this was being completely shut-off from OpenGL, which wasn't something that bothered me enough to go to the trouble of installing a driver for. Until certain software I use started making use of OpenGL.\nWell, a few hours ago I decided to install the proprietary fglrx driver provided on AMD's website.\nFirst thing I noticed was that OpenGL content now works.\nSecond thing I noticed was that sound doesn't. PulseAudio outright lists it as \"HDMI/DisplayPort (unplugged)\", even though the video still shows on my screen.\nSo I've been trying to make use of Google to find a solution to my issue, but nothing seems to work for me. So before I go mad, I've decided to ask the community.\nSome more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*I make use of PulseAudio to manage my sound, mostly because Alsa never seemed to even recognize my HDMI audio, and because my keybindings for adjusting Audio never worked for some reason. I have tried reinstalling PulseAudio, with no success.\n\n*Something I have already tried during my search (as some people seemed to suggest), was editing /etc/default/grub, and changing the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.audio=1\". Even after rebooting, there is no change.\n\n*I've also tried adding my user to various groups, such as \"audio\", \"video\" and so on, as that suggestion also came up in a few searches. No change.\nOn person claims they simply changed the profile for their devices to \"plugged\", but I don't see any way for me to do that, assuming I even can.\nIf anyone has a solution, I'm all ears.\nEdit: I ended up reverting to the \"Open Source\" drivers provided by Ubuntu, but for some reason, I am still having the same issue. PulseAudio still says \"HDMI/DisplayPort (unplugged)\" is shown, even though the HDMI video is clearly working.\n\nA: I had the exact same thing with an old Radeon 6900 Series.\nTo see info on pulseaudio devices:\npacmd list-cards\n\nLook for the card's index and, under that, profiles. For instance, I had:\n2 card(s) available.\n   ****index: 0****\n    name: <alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1>\n    driver: <module-alsa-card.c>\n    owner module: 6\n    properties:\n        alsa.card = \"1\"\n        alsa.card_name = \"HDA ATI HDMI\"\n...\n    profiles:\n        ****output:hdmi-stereo****: Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output (priority 5400, available: unknown)\n\nThose bits of info are then used to set the output profile:\npacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo\n\nNote that the set-card-profile parameters are the card index (0) and the output (hdmi-stereo).\nAfter that, things just worked.\nQueues came from here mostly: PulseAudio reports HDMI Audio is unplugged from the Nvidia MCP79 device\n\nA: I have the same issue. Each time I suspend the system and wake it up, pulseaduio says HDMI is unplugged. I do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to go to a terminal log in.\n\n\n*Then press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to the GUI.\nAfter that, pulseaudio says HDMI is plugged in (under Output Device).\n\nA: You cant do this on the default sound properties you need pauvcontrol\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\npavucontrol\n\ngo to the configuration Tab \nfind your device\nchoose a profile that is plugged.\nupdated: fixed typo in pavucontrol\n\nA: Thank you! Running this command mostly solves the problem:\npacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo\n\nIf not, pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then Ctrl+Alt+F7 solves it.\n\nA: I will try to help you. It sounds like your HDMI is working ok, but try this if you haven't already.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, plug in your HDMI cable.  \n\n*Go to settings and click on Displays.\n \n3.Now click on Mirror Displays.\n\n\n*Finally, click on apply. \n\n\nThat does it for the video. Now you'll want to adjust the audio so that you hear it from you television. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the volume control on the top right hand corner of the monitor. \n\n\n\n\n\n*Now scroll down to Sound Settings. You should see this screen:\n\n*Click on the HDMI menu in your sound settings and you are good to go.\nI hope this helps. \n\nA: Here is how I solved mine.\nMy motherboard is AMD Rs780 and my Ubuntu is 20.04.LTS, kernel 5.4.0-42\nIn my case, ALSA could use the HDMI sink, as I could prove by this command (it leaked sound on HDMI):\naplay -D plughw:[card],[device] /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav\n\nIf you want to test as well, you can get the values for [card] and [device] with this command:\naplay -l\n\nBut Pulse still insisted that the HDMI is unplugged.\nAfter a lot of digging, the only solution that worked for me was running the 2 following commands:\npacmd load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:[card],[device]\npacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.hw_[card]_[device]\n\nHere is where I found this solution: https://gist.github.com/bassmanitram/495fd35b76083f0c4a79777b8ab470fd\nUnfortunately I have to run it on every logon, since I haven't find yet how to set the init file.\nThe link below brings more technical details of the bug, looks like there are two parameters for the HDMI card, one for the video and other for audio, and the audio parameter (eld_valid) is wrongly set to 0.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1827967\n\nA: I have struggled with many solution but the only solution  that worked for me was set audio on with xrandr as below:\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --auto --set \"audio\" on\n\nand then HDMI device changes to plugged in in pavucontrol panel.\n\nOS: Debian bullseye\n\n\nA: You might try forcing a restart of pulseaudio, which you can do by running killall pulseaudio.\nIn the last month when I boot and first login, or when I recover from suspend, I see \"HDMI/DisplayPort (unplugged)\" or sometimes the HDMI output is not even listed; killall pulseaudio solves the problem each and every time: pulseaudio restarts itself, rescans devices, finds all the existing devices, and it works as expected, with no need of any other action.\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was changing the monitor scan rate from 60 to 25Hz (I am in a 50Hz country)\n", "Q: Uncaught PDOException: could not find driver after upgrading to ubuntu 16.04 After upgrading my php automatically upgraded to php7.but phpinfo(); shows no value on PDO section. and P.S pdo is showing \nUncaught PDOException: could not find driver\n\n\nA: Upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 updates automatically you php to php7 version , you are just missing php7-pdo extension sudo apt-get install php7-pdo then restart your web server should fix your issues.\n", "Q: Failed unmounting Mount unit for nvidia support in snappy I got an updated driver through the software updater, but when I rebooted I suddenly couldn't login to my system anymore. I used Ctrl + Alt + F1 to try and purge my nvidia drivers, but I got the following message:\nJob for var-lib-snapd-lib-gl.mount failed. See \"systemctl status var-lib-snapd-lib-gl.mount\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details.\n\nI used journalctl -xe and found the following error:\njun 04 00:26:17 Unity-X550JF systemd[1]: Failed unmounting Mount unit for nvidia support in snappy.\n\nSo long story short: The updated driver borked my system and I can't uninstall it in order to try to fix it. This leaves with a broken system where I can't login and attempting to login just throws me back to the login screen..\nDoes someone know what I can do this fix this? I can't use this now I really really need to get work done.\n\nA: I just had the same problem after upgrading. Waiting for response. I'm nearly used to that the system will go down every time after upgrading...\nI temporarily solved it by stopping lightdm and reinstalling NVIDIA driver:\nsystemctl stop lightdm.service\npurge nvidia (I have nvidia-364 installed)\ninstall nvidia-367\n", "Q: Making an iso backup of my system at work I use my system more like a Virtual Machine than a real computer, as I am always reinstall the operating system fresh then downloading the same stuff over and over again, so I just made an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system that is set up, it has corrected drivers and such for my nvidia card, is there some way I can create an .iso image of my pristine system so I dont have to remake it 3 to 5 times a day?\nAlso, I am aware of how bad this treatment is for the system, there is a more proper solution on its way, but it will be a bit.\n\nA: I would recommend to use a disk imaging tool like Clonezilla, which can backup the complete contents of your disk into an image, which can be stored on a USB drive, another disk, a network share, or even a writeable DVD.\nTo use it, Download the current stable version, write the ISO to a DVD or USB stick, and boot it, and follow the instructions to create an image of the entire local disk (There's plenty of tutorials, too). You will then have a compressed image, which you can later restore onto the system, using the same clonezilla DVD or bootable USB. (You can even put Clonezilla and the image on the same USB stick for subsequent restores).\nIf you want to make an actual installable ISO of your system, there are various tools for this, such as SystemBack, however, I haven't tried any of these myself.\n\nA: You can use Mondo Rescue Disaster Recovery Tool.\n# wget ftp://ftp.mondorescue.org/ubuntu/16.04/mondorescue.sources.list\n# sudo sh -c \"cat mondorescue.sources.list >> /etc/apt/sources.list\" \n# sudo apt-get update \n# sudo apt-get install mondo\n\nHere you can find more screenshots about how to proceed.\nOr, a simpler solution would be to use a Virtual Machine with Snapshots.\n\nA: If you want to back up the whole drive, replace /dev/sdX with the drive location (e.g. /dev/sda).\nIf you want to back up just one partition, replace /dev/sdX with the partition location (e.g. /dev/sda1).\nType the following command into the terminal, replacing /dev/sdX as stated above (/path/to/iso/file is where the ISO is saved)\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/iso/file\n\n\nTo restore the backup, boot off of a LiveCD and type the following into a terminal (Make sure /dev/sdX is still the same before continuing):\nsudo dd if=/path/to/iso/file of=/dev/sdX\n\nPlease note if you only back up the partition, you will need to re-install the bootloader.\n\nA: Install systemback for ubuntu or debian : \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nemh/systemback\n\n*sudo apt update\n\n*sudo apt install systemback\n\n", "Q: Reached Target shutdown 1 out of 8 times Ubuntu freezes at shutdown.

The root\n  partition is mounted as read-only so there’s no way to install\n  anything with apt-get. You can re-mount the root partition in\n  read-write mode (I’ve not tried this) but it’s incompatible with\n  getting software updates. I suppose I can grudgingly accept that this\n  was a reasonable technical solution for mobile software, but they\n  could have made at least minimal effort to allow me to install\n  packages at the same time.\n\n\n\n*Terminal with ssh, openvpn, python3 and pip3, i need for my activity\n\n*I understand there's an ARM-based processor and there're no repositories for ARM in APT, but i am wondering if can compile C++ right on it, so at least, i can always reinvent my own wheel for something? How can i actually get g++ working or it's there?\nThere is a lack of such information about this tablet.\n\nA: Temporarly enabling r/w does not disable system updates I have tried it:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw\n\nThe Important thing to remember is that updates are based on a diffrence between images so this will likely cause some changes you do to be wiped or break after update (or worse, thus the scare and warning you might need to reflash) but in practice just installing ssh or another terminal utility should work fine.\nAlso apt works fine out of box once making the file system writable (tested on my mx4 and my m10), and there are arm repositories. I have installed things like fish shell and silversearcher for the terminal on mine, the only problem left is the size of the root partition to install extra stuff.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes - root access and read/write system is easy to achieve. There seem to\nbe multiple methods, but the one I used was the android-gadget-service enable\nwritable command from the tablet. (source: this blog\npost)\n\n\nAbout updates while system is writable - I have automatic updates turned off,\nbut it was able to update to OTA11 with the system still writable and no apparent\nproblems.\n\n\n*Not sure about that, but with full root access it should be\npossible. The third party apps that come pre-installed can be uninstalled as\nwell.\n\n*and 4. Yes no problem. Once the system is writable you can install pretty much\nanything. There is a decent terminal app on the Ubuntu store (from memory it\nwas preinstalled too). There are plenty of repositories preconfigured with\nloads of programs available - at\nleast I was able to install python3, pip3, ruby, tmux, vim, gcc, etc... SSH is\nbuilt in and just needs enabling. It's\npretty easy to add ppa's for other programs too (I installed syncthing and neovim). \nSee this screenshot for an example of web development on the m10.\nThere's definitely not much information, agreed (unless you really dig around or ask\nlots of questions).

Luckily the command can be used in combination with multiple event types. \nSince you want the files inside the directory to be executable, in the script, two events are set:\n-e move\n\nwhich will notice files moved into the directory, and \n-e create\n\nwhich will notice new files created inside the directory.\nFurthermore, the options:\n-m -r \n\nare to make the command run indefinitely (\"monitor\") and recursively in the directory, while:\n--format '%w%f'\n\noutputs the directory (path to the file, %w) plus the filename (%f) that caused the event.\n More on options of inotifywait can be found here, or, as always, in man inotifywait\nThe script\n#!/bin/sh\n# you might want to change the directory below into the targeted directory\nDIR=\"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test123\"\ninotifywait -m -r -e move -e create --format '%w%f' \"$DIR\" | while read f\n\ndo\n  chmod +x \"$f\"\ndone\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*You will probably have to install inotify-tools first:\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as set_executable.sh\n\n*In the head of the script, set the path to the targeted folder:\n# change the directory below into the targeted directory\nDIR=\"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test123\"\n\n...and test-run the script from a terminal.\n\n*If all works fine, add the script to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add.\n\n\nNote\nNote that notifywait acts on changes (events). That implies that files that were added or created before the script ran will not be effected.

I'm just hoping someone will be able to help me, so I don't need to boot from usb/dvd and that I don't get error all the time when i restart OS. (I want Ubuntu to be my only OS).\nThank you in advance for your help\n\nA: You got an Acer UEFI laptop. You should start by creating a new partition table - GPT style for your Acer hardisk. You can do that by booting any live Ubuntu, open GParted and use the command for creating partition table - GPT. \nSecondly, in order for GRUB (Ubuntu's bootloader) to install correctly, you have to make sure that your USB drive has a GPT partition table style, too. You can easily do that with Rufus, by choosing GPT partititoning for UEFI PC option. Create a new FAT32 partition and write the Ubuntu iso file again to USB.  \nThird, i'd use a very simple partitioning scheme: sda1 -EFI partition, sda2 - Ubuntu (boot) partition, sda3 - swap, sda4 - home (or backup partition). Why so? EFI partition ALWAYS needs to be first, because that's were the partition table data will be written. Ubuntu partition would be your main partition - where you install and boot Ubuntu from.   \nSwap can theoretically be placed anywhere on disk, just make sure it's not in the first cylinder (cylinder 1024) of the disk. Swap acts as virtual RAM and it will be overwritten intensively. Wearing down the first cylinder will render you harddisk unusable. Swap size should be = 1,5...2 x RAM size. Using oversized swap is not advisable!! Swap is just a little helper, not a main workhorse.  \nHome or backup partition is entirely your choice. It will be your personal stuff partition.\nImportant thing: You should never install GRUB to any (particular) partition. You should install it in the root of your harddisk (e.g. /sda). If you have multiple internal disks, then GRUB should be installed in the root of your first harddisk (as listed in GParted).\n", "Q: Skype not showing people online on ubuntu?

It became a bit of a pain when I finished my project when I had to select my OS each time I turned on my laptop and it often just automatically went in to Ubuntu.\nWhile on windows in the disk management section I deleted the Ubuntu partition and then extended my windows one to fill the free space. When I turned on my laptop I was stuck at the grub rescue page we are all familiar with.\nI've done much research and took note of various fixes.\nAs a result of me deleting the partition and extending into the free space, it is not an option to reinstall Ubuntu from a disk/USB and fix the booter this way.

I was initially prompted to do this via a message under the Unity graphical front end but got the message Could not determine the upgrade.  I looked though a few previous questions posted on this site and tried upgrading via these three commands:\nsudo apt-get update –fix-missing\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nHowever after doing all of this the 'About this computer' pull-down system window shows the operating system as still being 15.10 whereas the command (issued via a terminal):\nlsb_release -a \n\nshows that it is 16.04.  Also, when I enter the command: \nunity --version\n\nI get 7.3.3 and not 7.4 which, I understand,  is supposed to be the updated version with Ubuntu 16.04.  I ran Synaptic Package Manager but this says that that 7.3.3 is the most recent version.  It appears that I can ask the Ubuntu Software Center to install Unity version 8 but I have not done this because I think that there may be an underlying problem.\nIn summary, it seems that I have a mix of 16.04 and 15.10 and if anyone can suggest how to resolve this I would be grateful.\n\nA: You can try:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt dist-upgrade\nI think you should always try to avoid the '-d' argument as it refers to development releases and may bring instability \n\nA: While trying to recover from a failed upgrade from 16.04 to 16.10 using your method, the same thing happened here when I did upgrade-grub: I got the same error message : Script `/boot/grub/grub.cfg.new' contains no commands and will do nothing Syntax errors are detected in generated GRUB config file. \nI discovered that the new grub.cfg file was still referencing the old kernel from 16.04, and my /etc/grub.d directory had been restored, but not populated!

I then usually use Sublime text editor, but that hardly solves purpose.\nMy typical task involves getting the repository from Github/Bitbucket and understanding the code flow, learning the project. So I would like to have a project explorer which will jump to definition of function, list all occurrences of word, find the calls to function. I would like to have this at project level than just file level. That is, the jump to function should happen even if the function is defined in other file.\nThe debugging, stepping through each line of code would be a big plus.\nJust to give some idea - I use Microsoft Visual Studio (for C++) at work and I a big fan of it. Its a solid IDE with exceptional programmer friendly features.\nSo is there anything close to it for Python in Ubuntu?\n\nA: My vote goes to PyCharm.\nIt is really a good IDE for python users. It integrates well with existing projects as well as new projects. It has all the features that anybody would want.\nThe quick highlights for those who haven't yet used:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Autocomplete - Most of the ide/editor provide this. The good is that it does not only suggest the literals existing in current file. It suggests the methods those can be used on that object.\nFor example if you create a list - a = []; on pressing a(dot), it will suggest append() etc.\nIt suggests whatever can be used at particular position of caret by pressing ctrl + space\n\n*Syntax Highlighting - This is done by all editors. Here the colors can be customized.\n\n*Code Flow Understanding - It jumps to definition, declaration, all places from where particular method is called, all occurrences of a literal - just with keyboard shortcuts.\n\n*Coding Guidelines - It warns you if you are missing some coding guideline.\nFor example- naming a function as HelloWorld() will result in warning \"function name should be lower case\"\n\n*External Dependencies - I found this very useful. I can see what all modules I can use, what all functions are there and how their implementation is.\n\n*Debugging - I have not yet done debugging as of now, but I am sure this will also be great looking at the other features that are provided.\n\n*Version Control System - I am yet to use this, but it has VCS.\n\n*Themes, Fonts, Color - We can change the ide theme, its color, font style, font size etc.\n\n*There are many small fetures like distraction free mode, presentation mode, code refactoring, file structure\n\n*Code Inspection - The best feature I might say. It checks every line of code in all files of project and suggests the coding guideline and its actually intelligent. Try this yourself.\nP.S.: After the comment from @JonasCz, I installed and used PyCharm. Thanks.\n", "Q: Ubuntu partition with windows 10 \"windows failed to start\" Currently having a nightmare dealing with this. I installed ubuntu via usb  alongside windows 10 (upgraded from windows 8). When I select Windows 8 option in Grub get a:\n\"Windows failed to start.

Is there some advanced startup options somewhere in ubuntu like there is in windows 10? Otherwise how will I run the Boot-Repair-Disk?\nI know I should have done the research properly before doing this it's my own damn fault. Can somebody help in getting me out of this hole I put myself in?\n\nA: You can shutdown your machine. Then power it on while repeatedly pressing the function key appropriate for your machine to bring the bios screen. For Lenovo it is F2, for HP it is F12. Go to boot option. Move to windows using arrow keys. Use F6 to bring it to top. Use F10 to save and exit. Now the machine should boot fine.\nIf it doesn't then you can enter your windows CD, go to BIOS, then boot option. Here you will see an entry for Windows CD. Move it to top, save and exit. You can now repair your windows without any problem. Hope it helps.\n", "Q: GUI tool for viewing and managing print queue? Edit:  For future visitors, here's a related answer which explains exactly how to do this quickly.\nI help this 75 year old man with Ubuntu (He's not very savvy). He freaks out at any mention of the terminal, and I understand that totally. So I try to find solutions for him that don't involve the terminal.\nHe is asking for a tool to view all print jobs in queue and to be able to cancel some or all of them.\nIs there any GUI tool to do this on Ubuntu? I know the terminal is very efficient, but a lot of non savvy people feel that the terminal is some scary realm where they're not sure what's going on.\nIf not, what would it take to create a little GUI tool for him?\n\nA: Calling the queue window in one double-click\nCouldn't resist automating the job in a .desktop file in a scandalously dirty hack. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the code below into an empty file, save it as printerqueue.desktop\n\n*Then either keep it on your desktop and make it excutable, or save it in ~/.local/share/applications\nTo use it, double click (on your desktop) or type Printer Queue (in Dash) to invoke the icon, and press return. Wait a few seconds (without clicking anywhere) and steps you did manually are done by the script. \n\nThe code\n[Desktop Entry]\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"'/usr/share/system-config-printer/system-config-printer.py' & sleep 3 && xdotool key Control_L+f\"\nName=Printer Queue\nType=Application\nIcon=printer\n\nExplanation\nThe printers window is called by the command:\n/usr/share/system-config-printer/system-config-printer.py\n\nIf we look into the file, it seems likely that we can somehow hack it to give it the option to show the queue from cli, since the queue window is a transient (child-) window the first one.\nThat would be the \"clean\" option on one hand, but I always feel restraint to do such a thing, Even if it was only for the possible trouble during updates.\nSo, the \"honest\" dirty option then :)\n\nA: This is somewhat hidden in the GUI, but accessible through a keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Ubuntu logo on the launcher bar, type printers, open the Printers app.\n\n*While in the Printers app, press Ctrl + F.\n\n*A list of jobs will appear. From this list one can manage jobs, delete them, etc.\nI've tested this on Ubuntu 14.04 and on Lubuntu 16.04 with Unity.\nI learned it from this answer. Actually, this might be a duplicate of that question. But then again, it might not be, because of the GUI requirement.\nMy friend is happy now. His printer is working again. By the way, he also had to do this.\n\nA: In addition to the \"Printers\" application, there is a CUPS web interface that can be used to view and manage printers and print jobs on your computer. Open a web browser and point it to http://localhost:631 and the print interface should appear.\n\nA: I am assuming you are using Unity, you can make it stick by doing the suggested answer above and use \"Lock to Launcher\" i.e.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Ubuntu logo on the launcher bar, type printers, open the Printers app.\n\n*Right-click on the icon on the Launcher, and click \"Lock To Launcher\".\n\n*Then everytime, he needs to open the Printer Queue, he can just click on the icon on the launcher, and either right-click \"View Print Job\" or press \"Ctrl-F\" on the Printer he wants to check.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Maybe this will help you:\nbash -c \"/usr/share/system-config-printer/system-config-printer.py --show-jobs $(lpstat -d | sed 's/.*: //')\"\n\nIt starts the print queue GUI of your printer.\nAnd this command is prepared to be included in the menu configuration to create an icon to start this GUI.

About a year ago \"Files\" and \"File Manager\" started to act very strangely and all my files were lost, despite an extensive search. Two days later I lost all my data and files from my SATA hard-drive. Luckily I had a backup, but \"Files\" continued to lose everything every time I put removable media into the USB slots.\nFrustrated with \"Files\" and \"File manager\" I installed \"Thunar\" which was an instant success. However \"Files\" is still set as the default manager for removable media and Rubbish Bin.\nToday \"Files\" moved the contents of my terrabyte SATA drive into the Rubbish Bin and changed the permissions, which prevented me from restoring the contents back onto the drive with \"Thunar\". In the end I had to copy the folders onto my desktop, rename them and put them back that way.\nI want to remove \"Files\" and \"File Manager\" but they cannot be un-installed in either \"Software Centre\" or the Dashboard. I cannot make \"Thunar\" open the removable media or the rubbish bin as \"Files\" must be the default for these operations. Is there any way of using terminal to remove these apps as they seem to be standard as part of the Ubuntu package\n\nA: Generally files is just nautilus so if you want to remove it maybe you have to execute\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nautilus\n\nbut I have a bad feeling about it. Nautilus is deeply integrated within ubuntu.\n\nAnyway I found a community help wiki that has methods to set Thunar as default file manager. There's a script method and there's a manual method.\nThe script method should be easier however there's a disclaimer written before it. (I don't think you should worry)\nTo use the script method anyway make a text file in your home folder and name it defaultthunar then copy this script and paste it inside the text file.\nThen run those two commands:\nchmod +x defaultthunar\n./defaultthunar\n\nThat's it. If you want to restore back nautilus run ./defaultthunar in terminal (which just runs the script again).\nAlternatively you can do the manual method if you want.\n", "Q: Include music app options into volume icon I recently changed over to mate from unity on my laptop.

I use it for my home as well as work.\nThe first thing you should do is start over from scratch to make troubleshooting easier. You can do this by running the command below in the terminal.\ndpkg-reconfigure samba-common\n\nThen go to the folder on the samba server that you want to share, and make sure that the user nobody can read and write to the share. This is because the user nobody is the username windows clients use. I usually just make a folder in the / directory just to keep things simple, but the \"correct\" way would be to make a subfolder of /srv. If you have not modified the permissions already, use the commands below.\nsudo chown -R nobody.nogroup the_folder\nsudo chmod -R 777 the_folder\n\nYou can also test to see if nobody can write to the directory by running the following command as root.\nsudo -u nobody touch test_file\n\nEdit your /etc/samba/smb.conf and add the lines below the [printers] share definition.\n[share_name]              ;the share name can be what ever you want\nbrowseable = yes\npath = the_complete_path_to_the_shared_folder\nguest ok = yes\nread only = no\ncreate mask = 777\n\nThen when you are done save it and run the following.\ntestparm\n\nThis will will warn you if you made any typos.

I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a disk with about 80GB of storage.  Recently, I started getting errors reporting that I did not have enough storage space.  I have other drives with several Terra-bytes free.  The mount command seems clear enough in some ways.  As I add software, and the log files grow, I'm not sure how to mount drives permanently ( using /etc/fstab file) to meet the need for more space.  In particular, I need more space for the /var partition, as well as /bin, /sbin, and perhaps /etc directories.  Can I or should I, mount /dev/sdb1 to '/'?\n      I had tried mounting a smaller disk to /home/bruce and the system said the folder was busy.  I haven't tried mounting to '/' as I don't know if that will address the issue.  Oh, they are all internal disks so they will likely be automatically mounted, or that is what I am observing when I boot my system.\nThanks in advance for any help,\nBruce\n\nA: I think the best solution for you, would be to clone the 80GB hard drive to one of your other drives with with \"several Terra-bytes free\". \nUbuntu by default will just install everything into one big / partition. If your system is set up this way, you can use something like clonezila or acronis to clone the drive and expand the / partition across the new drive. This way /var, /bin, /sbin, and /etc will all have more space.\nUnfortunately there is no easy way to add more storage to the / directory without reinstalling the OS, unless your / partition is a logical volume.\nAlso remember, when you are going through the desktop Ubuntu installation, if you select the \"something else\" radio button on the partitioning page you can choose which drives are going to be mounted to which locations.\nMounting hard drives in fstab is a good idea for when you are permanently mounting drives to locations that are not critical to the OS system. If you think you will want to add more memory to the system later on, I strongly suggest that you set your system up with an LVM because this will make the process much easier for you in the future. \n", "Q: Virtualization options on Ubuntu - are there others besides virtualbox The only reason I ask about other virtualization options is because after moving to Ubuntu and Linux from Windows, I still have a few apps that I want to use from the Adobe Creative Suite, e.g. Photoshop, among others.\nThe problem is that Virtualbox only lets me give up to 128MB of memory for video, which is probably system memory and not from my video card.\n       In fact, my video card is not recognized inside the Windows 10 guest.  I know I installed the extension pack.  I'm almost certain that I have the guest additions also installed.  I have a 2.5k monitor (as in about 2500px wide) but I am not able to select a resolution anywhere near that in the guest OS.  I also have an AMD Radeon R9-270X video card.\n        Do I need a different product or am I missing something with my Virtualbox setup?\nThanks,\nBruce\n\nA: QEMU\n\nQEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.\nWhen used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made\n  for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your\n  own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good\n  performance.\nWhen used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performance by\n  executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports\n  virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the\n  KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86,\n  server and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.\nQEMU is a member of Software Freedom Conservancy.\n\nText from QEMU's Official Wiki\nIMHO\nOne of the best Emulators. It does what it promises and it does good. It won't do anything else, it doesn't do a lot of things but emulating a machine. It's worth a try if you wish just to have a machine inside of another machine.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Another good visualization option for Ubuntu is VMware Workstation but, it is not free, (free as in you have to pay for it and you have no access to the source code). \nHowever, both virtualbox and vmware will give you poor video performance no matter what you do. OS visualization just doesn't provide you with good video performance.\nThe best solution for you would be to use a bare metal hypervisor such as xenserver.

I guess your trouble has something to do with the graphic part. Try to replace the VIA card with a Radeon or a nVidia. Even a super old one could do better than VIA.

Use K-meleon, Reconq, Midori or Lynx.\n\nA: Wow, that sounds pretty bad. It sounds almost like you are in limited graphics mode or something. (I'm not suggesting you are.)\nUse this Firefox extension to get the mobile versions of websites. Mobile versions are typically much more lightweight. If you're a Chrome user, use this. There are also lots of other alternatives that do the same.\nAlso, use Adblock, No-Scripts and Flashblocker extensions for your browser. Disable these on a per-site basis when it's needed for a particular site to work.\nYou can use a browser called Dillo. It runs like a dream. The words \"slow\" and \"Dillo\" don't belong in the same sentence. The obvious drawback to Dillo, though, is that many websites will not work like they should. (Especially interactive ones.) But when I'm on a very slow computer and browsing newspapers, blogs, and other such content, I like to use Dillo.\nMidori is also lightweight and fast, and has full compatability, unlike Dillo.\nYou can run Opera Mini on Ubuntu. It's made to work with Facebook, Gmail, etc. and is extremely lightweight. My friend had this stone-age laptop, and he loved using Opera Mini.

When I installed the Xubuntu on my Microsoft Surface Pro it seems it has disabled the original BIOS or something. I cannot get into the BIOS with any of the function keys on startup. All I want to do is a clean install of Lubuntu to make my system a little lighter so I can do simple dev work at school.\nI originally used my other PC with Kubuntu on it to create a Startup Disk with Xubuntu on the Microsd I used with my Surface pro. It was fairly easy to get Xubuntu installed but then I realized that it may perform better with Lubuntu installed fresh. I attempted to go through the identical steps I completed when I initially installed Xbuntu over Windows 10 but it doesnt seed to work that way now.\nHas anyone had any experience with this or know how I can install Lubuntu over Xubuntu in this case? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\nA: Google says these are the steps to access the bios on a surface pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the Surface Pro device is turned off.\n\n*Hold the volume-up button.\n\n*Press and release the power button.  \n\n*When the Surface logo appears, release the volume-up button.\n", "Q: Change order of electron tray icons A few questions regarding ordering of the tray icons already have been asked (see here for example). This usually works great, electron apps behave somehow differently. When running an electron app (e.g. whatsie, gitter or Franz) the command\ndbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.canonical.indicator.application /com/canonical/indicator/application/service com.canonical.indicator.application.service.GetApplications | grep \"object path\"\n\nyields\nobject path /org/ayatana/NotificationItem/D9C91CA1_0092_45B8_9F09_108CB12987B3/Menu\"\n\nfor the running electron app. The number D9C91CA1_0092_45B8_9F09_108CB12987B3 changes every time the app starts.

That seems to be an issue in your situation.\nAlthough xsel also has this issue, it can be worked around: if we make your script not only read the current selection into the script, but also write the same content to a file. We can then check if a the new selection is different from the last selection. If not, we can conclude no new selection is made, and the command most likely produces an outdated selection. We can then tell the script to pass.\nAn example (using xsel, which has slight advantages in this case):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# make sure the file to store the last selection exists\nf=~/.old_sel\ntouch $f\n# get the previous & current selection\nold=$(cat \"$f\"); new=$(xsel -o)\n\nif [ \"$old\" != \"$new\" ]; then\n  # if selection changed, store the new selection to remember\n  echo \"$new\" > \"$f\"\n  # do the action, whatever that may be\n  echo $new\nfi\n\nNo need to say that you'd need to install xsel:\nsudo apt-get install xsel\n\n", "Q: Fan control on MSI laptop: no pwm-capable sensors?

I installed the Extension Pack and also the Guest Additions for Linux.\nI've got a PNY 128 GB USB 3.0 drive.  When I plug it in, Windows detects it and I can access files.  When I try to access it through the VM (Devices -> USB -> PNY USB 3.0 FD), the Windows host releases it, but it does not become available in the client.  When I use dmesg, I get output like this:\nusb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 6 using ehci-pci\nusb 1-1: device descriptor read/64 error 18\nusb 1-1: device descriptor read/64 error 18\nusb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci\nusb 1-1: device descriptor read/64 error 18\nusb 1-1: device descriptor read/64 error 18\nusb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\nusb 1-1: invalid ep0 maxpacket: 9\nusb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 9 using ehci-pci\nusb 1-1: invalid ep0 maxpacket: 9\nusb usb1-port1: unable to enumerate USB device\n\nFor this particular instance, I have the USB settings for the VM set to USB 2.0.  I seem to get essentially equivalent results if I set for USB 3.0.\nI also have an older Dell XPS desktop computer running Windows 7 and the same configuration of VirtualBox and Ubuntu.  On that machine, the same USB drive works perfectly on host and in the Ubuntu guest.  In addition, I have a very old Gateway laptop running a recent version of lubuntu (no VirtualBox), and it also handles the same USB drive without problem.  This makes me think there is nothing wrong with the drive itself.  \nAt this point, I'm not sure if my problem is with Windows 10 as the host or with the laptop.  I searched for others with this problem, but I've been finding older posts that date before USB 3.0 was supported in the 5.0.20 version of VirtualBox. (The error that I'm seeing looks to me like it's the same that people were getting on the older versions of VirtualBox, but I don't claim a lot of expertise here.)\nAny advice for debugging or correcting this problem?\n\nA: What kind of port are you plugging the USB-stick into? VirtualBox can't handle stuff plugged into USB 3.0 ports in my experience (running VirtualBox 5.0.26 with extentions). Trying to attach USB 3 devices in a USB 3 port throws an error, connecting the same device into a USB 2 port (or into a USB 3 port via a USB 2 hub) works just fine.\n\nA: I have this exact same problem on a Dell Latitude 7480, and a WD 15 dock. I am using Windows 10 for the host OS, and Ubuntu 18.04 as guest. My VirtualBox is 5.2.18, set to emulate USB 3.0 (xHCI) within the VM.\nAll the ports on the laptop itself do not work, giving the error 18 and enumeration problems shown by the OP. There are also two USB 3.0 ports on the WD 15 dock which do not work. They are on the same side of the dock as the headphone jack. I also tried with USB 1.0 and 2.0 emulation in VirtualBox.\nOn the back of the WD 15 dock, between the power input, and the Ethernet port, are two USB 2.0 ports. Those work without a problem using USB 1.0 emulation. Setting USB back to 3.0 in VirtualBox allowed these ports to continue to work.\nThe answer seems to be to use USB 2.0 hardware ports if you want to use USB within an Ubuntu 18.04 guest. The USB emulation setting does not matter.\n\nA: In case you stumbled on this trying to find help with VMware Fusion or VMware workstation (I'm an ex-VMware employee, so I prefer it over VirtualBox), a similar answer works here.

Then everything worked fine after rebooting my VM and connecting the device.\n\nA: The same happened to me when attaching an external Hard Disk via USB into an Ubuntu 20 running in ESXI.

My system has an AMD Radeon HD 8470d graphics card on an AMD A4-7300 APU. Looking on the AMD site, their driver only supports up to Ubuntu 14.04\nCurrently there doesn't seem to be any graphics driver installed. I tried:\nlshw -c video\n\nbut it doesn't list any drivers installed. Same with:  \nlspci 0nnk | grep -i vga -A3 \n\njust lists \"Kernel modules: radeon\" but no driver. \nIn some programs my graphics driver is being listed as VMware Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe. I googled this and it's a software renderer, so it looks like my poor CPU is handling the graphics for now which explains the terrible performance all round.\nWhen I look at Additional Drivers it just finds one unknown device and gives two options:\n\n-Using Processor microcode firmware for AMD CPUs from amd64-microcode (proprietary)\n  -Do not use the device\n\nDoesn't seem to make much difference which of these I select. Neither breaks the computer, but neither fixes the problems or seems to improve performance in any way, shape or form.\nIs there some solution to this within 16.04? Or should I just re-install with 14.04 so that I can use the official drivers?\nEDIT:\nI looked into installing the Radeon Opensource Driver as suggested. I found this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver and since my card isn't listed in the supported chipsets I ran the recommended test command:\n\ndmesg | egrep 'drm|radeon'\n\nIt returned the following:\n\n[    1.331659] [drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810 \n  [    1.367284] [drm] VGACON disable radeon kernel modesetting.\n  [    1.367306] [drm:radeon_init [radeon]] ERROR No UMS support in radeon module!\n  [    7.918783] [drm] VGACON disable radeon kernel modesetting.\n  [    7.918805] [drm:radeon_init [radeon]] ERROR No UMS support in radeon module!\n\nI might give the open source driver a go anyway before I roll back to 14.04. But I'll wait and see if there are any more suggestions first.\n\nA: The proprietary driver fglrx is no longer supported by amd and you can't use it in ubuntu 16.04 (due to xorg and kernel versions). The alternative is the amdgpu opensource driver which your system will use it automatically if your gpu supported it. Since it doesn't seem to support it you only have the radeon opensource driver. If you need fglrx then yes, the only solution is installing ubuntu 14.04.\nSome links to verify this (suggested by @Mark Kirby via comment) are here:\nhttps://linux.slashdot.org/story/16/03/09/2049232/ubuntu-drops-support-for-amds-catalyst-gpu-driver\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/03/ubuntu-drops-amd-catalyst-fglrx-driver-16-04\n\nA: As the others said, fglrx is no longer present with Ubuntu 16.04. The radeon driver with the Mesa part should be more than enough to handle your card. But there really seems to be some error on your system, as Mesa isn't using the proper one for your card.\nYou could try reinstalling and reconfiguring xorg. Maybe try Live mode and see if it is the same there.\n\nA: I have a Radeon HD 8470D on AMD A6-6400K APU and just encountered the same problem you had (half a year ago).\nI had the same log outputs you described and was able to get the radeon driver running on Ubuntu 16.04.1 with the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*install kernel 4.7 and start it\n\n*disable the nomodeset kernel parameter in /etc/default/grub which seems to be active since you get VGACON disable radeon kernel modesetting.

It doesn't support vertical sync, that is where image tearing is coming from. Citing Nvidia:\n\nThere is no synchronization between the images rendered by the NVIDIA GPU and the output device. This means that the output device can start reading the next frame of video while it is still being updated, producing a graphical artifact known as “tearing”. Tearing is currently expected due to limitations in the design of the X.Org X server.\n\nI suggest you to use Bumblebee driver. It will give you some performance penalty, but given that you say that you are not a gamer, you won't notice it. I used it for years with same generation CPU and GPU as yours (second gen core CPU and Fermi GPU) and it worked flawlessly all the time.\nIt may take some time to setup though, especially for the first time... For starters, refer to Bumblebee wiki.\n", "Q: Permission denied when copying files from OSX backup disc I have OSX backup disk which I want to backup.

What options do I select when installing Ubuntu 16.04 that the partition scheme will work for both OS's.\nGPT from Android x86 shows:\nsda1    ext3    FUJITSUMHV2080B \n\nHowever, I'm not terribly familiar with GPT and would have to do quite a bit of reading to understand the codes it uses for different types of formatting.\n\nA: I believe this is adaptable for use on any Ubuntu distribution to dual boot with Android X86 without having to use separate partitions for each OS. This works thanks to the ability to use the same ext4 journaling file system for both operating systems. It took me a couple days to compile this. If your Ubuntu or Android X86 distribution are different, simply remember to make the appropriate terminal command changes (Android X86 4.4 to 5.1 would look like; initrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img} to initrd /android-5.1-r1/initrd.img}). Check system for 64 bit support before downloading .ISO files. If your system does not support 64 bit, use 32 bit, or 86 bit.\n\nHow to install dual boot of Android 4.4 x86 r3 and Ubuntu (on the same partition)\n(Works with other revisions and versions of Android X86)\nThings you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Non-partitioned HDD (formatted)\n\n*(x2) USB flash drives 2GB or larger\n\n*Secondary PC to flash .ISO files to USB flash drives\n\n\nBegin by downloading Unetbootin, and .ISO files for both Android x86, and Ubuntu.\nFlash the .ISO files to each of the USB flash drives.\nEnter BIOS on PC with formatted HDD and enable booting from USB/CD.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Ubuntu .ISO and complete a full install.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Android x86 4.4 r3 and begin install following these exceptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When prompted, select HDD sda1 and DO NOT format or select another file system.\n\n*When prompted, DO NOT install GRUB, or EFI GRUB 2.\n\n*When prompted, select as read and write.\n\n\nRemove all media and boot the PC (it will automatically load Ubuntu).\nOpen the terminal and type:\nsudo -i\nnano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nUsing the arrow keys, navigate the the line below the last current entry in the custom boot loader menu and make the following four entries:\nmenuentry \"Android-x86\" {\nset root='(hd0,1)'\nlinux /android-4.4-r3/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=generic_x86 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/android-4.4-r3\ninitrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img}\n\nPress and hold ctrl, x, then press y, and then press Enter\nType:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nImmediately after BIOS loads, press and hold the Shift key until GRUB loads.\nSelect which operating system you wish to use.\n\nRECOMMENDED! Load Ubuntu first, and create a disk image (.ISO file) of your new dual boot set-up and flash it to another USB flash drive and store it as a backup. You can do this after you apply any updates, or install any programs you wish.\n\nThe result should be a dual booted Ubuntu and Android X86 utilizing the default Ubuntu GRUB2 boot loader menu with the benefits of; no separate partition for OS's, shared Linux swap space, same file system (ext4), space for installation of Android applications limited ONLY to the space remaining on your HDD (not a weak 2Gb-??Gb partition), and the ability to file browse between Ubuntu and Android X86. Essentially you have installed Android X86 within Ubuntu.\nnote: Unetbootin now has a self contained application downloadable and compatible with Windows.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04LTS boot loader crashes I am using Win 10 and Ubuntu as dual boot.The boot loader of my Ubuntu continues to crash.

As I read the instructions it sounds like I install OpenStack on my freshly minted MAAS box but from the network diagrams it looks like you have a MAAS controller sitting on the side and an OpenStack controller sitting next to it.\nShoud I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run \"openstack-install\" on the MAAS machine?\n\n*Push an Ubuntu install to the machine I want as my OpenStack controller and run \"openstack-install\" on that one?\n\n\nThanks for any help! I think I'm missing something obvious.\n\nA: I suppose you could do either.  However, depending on the size of your intended cloud, running MAAS separately from where you run openstack-install might make sense.  Most deployments I would expect you to run openstack-install on your MAAS server, infact, the instructions intend on you doing exactly that.\nThe first step of the installer is to install Landscape to one of the nodes listed in MAAS.  After that process is done and some services are deployed, then you'll load up Landscape to actual deploy openstack to the remaining nodes.  Then the services like Neutron, Compute, Cinder, etc, etc... Will be spread over the network.\n", "Q: Service isc-dhcp-server fails to start I'm currently working on a project of making an highly secured router with my RaspberryPi to navigate anonymously on the net.

Any help would be warmly welcomed!\n\nA: IN CASE IT HELPS ANYONE I've just been right through this exasperating issue, on DietPi (Debian Buster) on a Pi Zero W and HAVE BOTTOMED THE PROBLEM.\nisc-dhcp-server is excellent but DOES HAVE this quirk, as noted by the original enquirer above. I've bottomed the problem - it's not a bug - and this is the detail of the reason:\nisc-dhcp-server refuses (throws an error) if it cannot see an UP ethernet network subnet at launch time; it DOESN'T (contrary to some commentators) require an actual connection TO the ethernet port to which it is associated.\n\nWhen developing a WiFi Hotspot device, its normally a case of using hostapd as the AP server function (which re-configures the WiFi hardware to switch to AP mode) and alongside hostapd, you need a dhcp server like isc-dhcp-server to provide the IP address leasing service.\n\nSO: normally the start point, is a WiFi device which at boot, was configured as a CLIENT device, but needs to be switched to HOST mode to act as hotspot. So an early step is to set wlan0 (or whatever) DOWN, prior to launching hostapd.\n\nBUT that situation, is immediately one of those which isc-dhcp-server does not like: if you try to start it before hostapd, it will fail, complaining that there is no subnet for it to listen on.\nSo you may innocently then try, adding a new IP address (for the host) to your wlan0 (or equiv) and re-trying: THAT WON'T WORK EITHER, because although you now have a new IP attached to the Ethernet port, you will also find you cannot set it 'UP' (ip link set wlan0 up will FAIL). This is because the port is 'tainted' by the still-active stale address and the wpa-supplicant process which was using it.\n\nLONG STORY SHORT: you need to kill wpa-supplicant, to \"free\" the old address / FLUSH the ip settings for the port / THEN add the new IP address for host ; EVEN THEN, you'll find isc-dhcp-server STILL won't start, because you can't set the interface up - yet. Finally - run hostapd now, before isc, and IT will (in reconfiguring the chipset) also SET the wlan0 interface, to UP. So now - finally - you CAN run isc-dhcp-server, and it will start cleanly, and your hotspot will be up.\n\nIt's taken me about five hours, I hope this saves someone some time. My distilled note:\nSORTING ISC-DHCP-SERVER alongside HOSTAPD: THE SOLUTION\nYOU HAVE TO follow THIS SEQUENCE:\nKILL the wpa-supplicant process (that's sustaining the client conn) this way:\n\nkill -2 $( cat /run/wpa_supplicant.wlan0.pid )\n\nsleep 1\n\nkill -9 $( cat /run/wpa_supplicant.wlan0.pid )\n\nFLUSH the WLAN IP setup, using:\n\nip addr flush dev wlan0\n\nADD the new host IP ADDRESS, using:\n\nip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev wlan0\n\nSTART hostapd, which will also put wlan0 UP:\n\n/usr/sbin/hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf &\n\nSTART isc-dhcp-server ( WLAN is up, as host now ):\n\nsudo service isc-dhcp-server restart\n\nTHEN the Access Point should be UP and ready to accept clients.\nThose are my addresses of course / edit to suit your need.\nTWO MORE TIPS: Config files hostapd.conf and dhcp.conf can drive you mad also: -here are working samples. IMPORTANT: do not sweat the 'drivername' in hostapd.conf: it's not needed. 'Commented out' is fine:\nhostapd.conf\ninterface=wlan0\n#driver=brcmfmac\nssid=THIS-IS-MY-AP\ncountry_code=US\nhw_mode=g\nchannel=6\nmacaddr_acl=0\nauth_algs=1\nignore_broadcast_ssid=0\nwpa=2\nwpa_passphrase=12345678\nwpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\nwpa_pairwise=CCMP\nwpa_group_rekey=86400\nieee80211n=1\nwme_enabled=1\ndhcpd.conf\nCOMMENT OUT BOTH OF THE TEMPLATES' 'option domain..' lines..\nthen ADD THIS AT BOTTOM:\nsubnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range 10.1.1.100 10.1.1.109; option broadcast-address 10.1.1.255; option routers 10.1.1.1; default-lease-time 600; max-lease-time 7200; option domain-name \"mynetwork.org\"; option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4; }\nThough this work on Pi it was on DietPi which is straight Debian, so this same advice should suit many Linuxes, including Ububtus of many flavours.\nGOOD LUCK ALL\n", "Q: Install python 3.5.1 on ubuntu 14.04 I would like to know how to install python 3.5.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: The easiest way to install Python 3.5 is with anaconda\nhttps://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install\n", "Q: How to update Vorbis codec? After ripping audio CDs to Ogg-Vorbis files with Asunder, I noticed that it uses the libVorbis 1.3.4 (Turpakäräjiin) codec from 2014 (program installed via apt-get). Is there any way to update the system's libvorbis to the newest version so that it will be used instead?\n\nA: If you want the newest version from xiph.org/vorbis you can install the git version, although, it is not recommended.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git automake m4 libtool buildessential\n\nYou may need to install:\nsudo apt install libvorbis-dev\n\nand\nsudo apt build-dep libvorbis\n\nYou may need to install more packages but you will have to pay attention to the output when you run the following commands. Any error should tell you what you need to install if you do need to install something else.\nRun the following commands to clone and compile vorbis from source:\ncd ~/\ngit clone https://git.xiph.org/vorbis.git\ncd vorbis\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nYou may see a couple of \"warnings\" but you can ignore warnings. Pay attention to any errors.\nIf you have problems, you can uninstall by running the following commands:\ncd ~/vorbis\nsudo make uninstall\n\nIf you want to update in the future, you can run the following commands:\ncd ~/vorbis\ngit pull https://git.xiph.org/vorbis.git master\nmake clean\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake \nsudo make install\n\nRun the following command for more info:\ncat ~/vorbis/README.md\n\n\nNext, to run asunder using the new libs, run the following command:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib asunder\n\nAlternatively, you can permanently set the new libvorbis system wide by running the following command:\necho '/usr/local/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libvorbis.conf\n\nIf you run into problems running the new libvorbis with other applications, you can run the following command to remove the system wide link.\nsudo rm /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libvorbis.conf\n\nI have verified that both of these methods work.\nClick here for more information about linked libraries.\nClick here for more information about vorbis.\n", "Q: Corrupt pendrive after making live Ubuntu installer I have sandisk 8GB\nI had kali linux installed. I tried to create Bootable live Ubuntu pendrive. I went to the terminal and issued the following commands: \nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1k count=2048\n\nsudo parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos\n\nsudo parted -a none /dev/sdb mkpart  primary fat32 0 2048\n\nmkfs.vfat -n \"Disk\" /dev/sdb1\n\nsudo dd if=./ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdd bs=8129\n\nIt created bootable live USB installer for Ubuntu successfully.\nAfter dual booting my latop with Ubuntu and Kali linux I now need the pendrive for data storing purpose\nIt was showing a capacity of only 64 MB. I used dd command to reformat it but that wouldn't help. I also used gparted but that didn't help.\nWhat to do now?\n\nA: You can try to select \"Create partition table\", under the device menu in Gparted, in order to fully reformat it. (Select msdos as the partition table type). Then, you should be able to create a new partition on the USB stick.\n\nIf that doesn't work, a very simple (But slow, and I'm sure there's a better way) way to fix this would be to simply overwrite the entire drive with dd, by using something like this:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4M\n\nWhich will overwrite the entire contents with zeroes, after which you should be able to create a partition table and a partition with Gparted as described above.\n\nA: Try mkfs.vfat.\nAssuming your pendrive is /dev/sdb\nsudo mkfs.vfat -I -n \"Name you want\" /dev/sdb\n\nwill create a new FAT32 filesystem on /dev/sdb. (If you want NTFS, replace mkfs.vfat with mkfs.ntfs)\nExplanation of -I:\n-I creates a filesystem on the entire /dev/sdb device, removing any previous partitions.\nFrom man mkfs.vfat:\n-I  It is typical for fixed disk devices to be partitioned so, by default, you are not permitted to create a filesystem across the entire device.  mkfs.fat  will  complain  and  tell  you  that  it  refuses  to  work.  This is different when using MO disks.  One doesn't always need partitions on MO disks.  The filesystem can go \n    directly to the whole disk.  Under other OSes this is known as the 'superfloppy' format.  This switch will force mkfs.fat to work properly.\n\n\nA: I finally managed to solve the problem. It's quite easy once you gain the basic understanding. The main thing is that in Linux you should never use graphical user interface and always stick with terminal. I did the following in terminal:\nsudo su\n\nThis makes me sudo user by default without the need to put sudo at first everytime\nfdisk -l\n\nThis checks for the present disks. Thus I can safely determine my pendrive to be sdb. dd is destructive command and has to be carefully used against correct drive\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4M\n\nThis overwrites the entire disk with zeros. It wipes all present file systems and partition tables.

Then I go to second step ( How to use manual partitioning during installation? ) and use \"Something else\", thing that I want to know is, do I use \"New Partition Table\" or I just add (swap, ext4 /, /home) to partitons that I made in Gparded (fat32, linux-swap, ext4) ?\nIf I dont use \"New Partition Table\" its looking like to much partitions, and if I use \"New Partition Table\" and use only (swap, ext4 /, /home) then it's asking me to make boot or efi partition.

XFS file system for the boot partition is preferred.\nAlso you need to create a linux-swap partition and trun swap on. Ideally it is twice the size of your physical RAM.\nFurther partitions you can create in either gparted or during installation. the second method makes thing easier. if you prefer creating partitions in gparted, then also it is fine. You have to go to Something else --> Select an already creaated partition, click change and give mount point.\nElse you can directly go to something else option without first making further partitions in gparted. Change the 512 MB partition and give it mount point /boot. Leave the swap partition as it is. These two parrtitions are essential. The other partitions are optional. The file format of the other partitions should be either ext4 or btrfs.\nAt this stage you can either create a single partition using the entire remaining disk space and give it the mount point / make the boot loader device /dev/sda (assuming sda is your primary disk) and continue with installation or make further partitions. If you chose to make further partitions then do the following:\n/opt partition is meant for installing third party  directly from internet and not via repoitory. Create a partition of aabout 50 GB and give it mount point /opt\n/var partition is meant for installing system files. Make a partition of about 80 GB and give it mount point /var\n/root partition is meant for storing personal files for root user. Create a partition of about 50 GB and give it mount point /\n/home partition is meant for storing your personal files. I think creating these many partitions are enough. Create this partition using remaining unallocated space and give it mount point /home\nNow device for installation of boot loader is by default /dev/sda. If not make it.\nThen proceed with installation as usual.\n", "Q: Swapping between video cards on Ubuntu 16.04 With Ubuntu 16.04, fglrx and Catalyst Center is no more.

Using reboot, there was no effect. Giving the command and using Logout, I only got low graphics mode error and couldn't get back to the system. Thankfully after a hard reboot things returned back to the original.\nI also tried using echo OFF (if I can't get it to work, why leave it on). On next reboot this worked, but too efficiently. Not only the dedicated device was no more listed in lspci, even the switch file vanished. Not sure, if this is intentional. A bit later I somehow managed to get back to the starting point.\nMy aim is still the same. I would like to use the dedicated one and be able to switch between the two.\nUpdate 2: My dedicated card uses the radeon kernel driver, so the problem shouldn't be related to the amdgpu driver being new and not supported by vgaswitcheroo.\nUpdate 3: Haven't read it through in details, but seems to be a bug listed here: bugs.launchpad\nAt least he doesn't get black screen like me whenever trying.\n\nA: Some news.\nI updated the kernel to 4.4.13.

I have several pages to scan.  I want to be able to initiate the scan of each page from the scanner using its SCAN button rather than from the program.  That's so I don't have to run back and forth from the scanner to the computer.  Is that possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: This answer is for xsane 0.999 in Debian, with an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo scanner. It also has a dedicated scan button which I wanted to use for scanning multiple pages.\nThere should be no changes to this from version 0.998 in Kubuntu 14.04.\nThe \"trick\" is to increase the Number of pages to scan, open the Advanced options window, and enable Wait for Button. Setting the number of pages to something much larger than the number you plan to scan should be fine.\nThe page numbers will be auto-incremented, and xsane will scan N pages, waiting for the button before each page.\n\n", "Q: How intelligent is OpenSSH when it comes to connecting to a domain that leads to your internal network? I run Ubuntu on my personal machine, and have an network of servers on my local network at my house. I have a cloud server, and a software development server, as well as some others. \nMy servers have quite a few services which rely on SSH and I have several servers with OpenSSH services running on a few different ports. The internal services are all connected to a domain through DDNS.\nThe internet that is available for my area is very quick, but it has a bandwidth cap. Let's take a scenario to explain my question.\nSay I have a large 10 GB file that I want to transfer from my cloud server to my personal machine and I want to transfer it through SFTP using the Ubuntu OpenSSH client. Say my personal machine is currently connected to the same local network as the server. \nMy personal machine has some SSH profiles that I use to connect to this server, but they point at \"cloud.mydomain.com:22\" rather than \"192.168.1.1:22\". Is the client \"smart\" enough to know that the domain is pointing to the same external IP it is making the request on and instead route directly to the internal IP, or will I be making the transfer both ways and transferring 20GB of file over my internet connection, rather than just transferring the 10GB file directly?\nDescription of Network: \nRouter #1 is the router which provides the internet. All ports forward to Router #2.\nRouter #2 is a repeater bridge with specific ports forwarding to certain IP addresses. (2222 points to the cloud server SSH, 22 points to the development server SSH, etc.)\n(Set up like this so I can move my setup to a new router #1 and just forward all the ports to Router #2 with one setting.)\nThe cloud server updates the DDNS every 5 seconds or so. Domain.com points to Router #1, which in turn forwards all external traffic to Router #2. Depending on port, traffic will be routed to whichever server the port is mapped to.\n\nA: SSH client resolves DNS of you domain and it connects to the IP it receives. It does what all the other Internet facing clients. There is nothing about being \"smart enough\".\n\nA: No, because you are telling it to connect to the external, and that is what it will do.  \nYou might be able to get around this if you have a local DNS server that will check local domain requests from your clients before searching the internet, that might work.\n", "Q: How can I install BlueGriffon 2.0 from a deb package or PPA?

In the sound control pannel, I have \"digital output (S/PDIF) | USB AUDIO\" and \"Analog Output | USB AUDIO\". When I try to test either of these, nothing comes out of the speakers. The speakers work on my windows computer, and control the volume of the Ubuntu computer when the volume buttons on the speakers are pressed.\nI am at a loss of what to try next. When googling for the problem, I come up with many results from 5-6 years ago, with terminal commands that are obsolete.\n\nA: I had the same problem: could not get sound out of Logitech S-150. When I went into Sound Settings and changed it to USB and closed out, it would still be on HDMI when I went back in. It should stay on whatever is highlighted when you close the window.\nI ran pulseaudio -k in terminal and that fixed my issue. Now when I choose USB in Sound Settings and move the volume bar up I hear sound out of the Logitech S150 and also I can now change it to another output and close out of Sound Settings and it stays on what I had picked. \nIf that does not work, you might want to also install/run pavucontrol and see if the USB AUDIO is an option on the Output Devices tab. You will want to resize the window so you see all of the tabs at the top. If you see the USB AUDIO on the Output Devices tab but sound is not coming out of them then play some music and go to the Playback tab and click on HDMI or whatever shows and pick USB AUDIO from the list. Make sure your volume is on the low side so you don't max the speakers out when the sound finally does come through.\n", "Q: How to install Epson L210 scanner in Ububtu 16.04?

All the window decorations are enormous.  All the font sizes are gigantic.  Some of the icons near the clock are humongous.\nHow can I change these sizes?  A way to tweak things without editing config files is preferred.  Perhaps it's dependent on the \"theme\" (currently Ambiance)---how do I change the sizes defined there?\n\nWhat I've tried:\nThis is what the Displays config screen looks like this:\n\nNote that there is no Scale for menu and title bars option, so nothing referencing that setting is applicable (such as the answers to this question).\nUnity tweak tool's Text scaling factor setting under Fonts seems to only apply to text, but not window decorations, so that's not a full solution.  (And obviously, setting the font sizes there also affects text but not window decorations).\nI've also tried to change the DPI settings from the answers to this question, but nothing in the top answer there seems to affect anything at all on my machine.\nI've also pored through gconf-editor for any settings that might affect any of these sizes but didn't find anything but font size settings again.\n\nOther considerations:\nI should mention that I've run into this on two computers now, which is why I'm seeking a solution in software rather than changing resolutions or getting different monitors.  I installed stock Ubuntu 16.04 while my other machine was hooked up to a 4k display, and then moved it to a smaller, HD-only monitor.  I have the exact same problem there: everything's too big.  (But it looked great while it was on the 4k display!)\n\nA: Objects of your interface are too big because your resolution is too low. You've got large 30'' monitor and only 1920x1200 resolution (as I can see on your screenshot).\nOpen the \"Resolution\" dropdown menu - it should contain 2560x1600 setting (which has the same size ratio as your current one, i.e. 16:10). Select it and press \"Apply\". If the dropdown menu line with 2560x1600 is not the last, and your monitor is able to sustain even greater resolution, use it.\nAnd then, when your resolution will fit the native resolution of your monitor, you can use the advice you've mentioned in your question to adjust the DPI of your monitor properly.\nDifferent GUI aspire to achieve resolution independence. This will ensure that all interface elements will look the same and have the same size on different device types be it phone, tablet or PC monitor. If you check the mentioned link, you'll see that GNOME isn't resolution independent yet. 1920x1200 fits well the 22-23'' monitor. If you use it on 15'' screen, all objects will be too small and you'll need to increase font size to get improved readability. In your case the screen is 7'' bigger than the proper one for this resolution, that's why you've got an opposite problem - everything looks too big.\nIf you wish to alter your font sizes, this may also decrease the sizes of your interface objects. Use GSettings configuration tool to achieve that. Run this command in your terminal:\ngsettings list-recursively | grep desktop | grep font\n\nIn my case it returns:\norg.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences titlebar-font 'Ubuntu Bold 10'\norg.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences titlebar-uses-system-font false\norg.gnome.desktop.interface document-font-name 'Ubuntu 10'\norg.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 10'\norg.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name 'Liberation Mono 10'\norg.gnome.nautilus.desktop font 'Ubuntu 10'\n\nFirst key affects the window titlebar, third key sets Document font name/size, fourth key sets Font name/size which affects all interface elements (i.e. menus, panels, etc.), fifth key sets Monospace font/name which is used in your terminal. And the sixth setting affects the name/size of the font of your desktop icons (if any).\nSo, if I wish to decrease, say, the size of the font used on the panels by one (in my case 'Ubuntu 10' will become 'Ubuntu 9'), then I should run the command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Ubuntu 9'\n\nAdjust the sizes of your fonts as you see fit, selecting the proper schemes and keys with GSettings. If you prefer GUI tools, you can try Unity Tweak Tool, which can be found here.\n\nA: I have no research to back this up, but I'm posting it because after looking for a week or so, I now believe it's true.\nThere are no configurable window manager decoration/chrome sizes in stock Ubuntu 16.04.\nIt's possible to configure the sizes of fonts, which can make some UI elements such as menus smaller, but the window manager will always draw the close/minimize/maximize buttons, for example, at the same pixel size.  The easiest way to change font settings is by installing Unity Tweak Tool (unity-tweak-tool is the package name) and modifying them there; alternately whtyger's answer contains a command-line solution.\n\nA: There is a mightier software for configurations than the unity tweak tool: compizconfig settings manager - ccsm! Download it from the software center or from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThere you can change and configure almost everything you want. It's definitely the mightiest configuration tool around, which might be what you are looking for!\n\nA: Further to whtyger's answer above, if you are using Nemo as your default file manager, Nautilus & Gnome settings will have not effect on the Desktop Files/Folders icon text.\nInstead use:\ngsettings list-recursively | grep nemo | grep font\n\nand this should return a result including, \"org.nemo.desktop font ...\", e.g.\norg.nemo.desktop font 'Ubuntu 11'\n\nchanging the font details above to, for example, 'SanSerif 8', will change the Desktop Files/Folders icon text size and font, e.g.\ngsettings set org.nemo.desktop font 'SanSerif 8'\n\nI spent ages trying to figure out what is missing or wrong with my laptop, only to eventually realise that using Nemo file manager as a default, changed whtyger's answer detail slightly.\n", "Q: Gnu Grub menu does not recognise my MS Windows installation I had dual boot set up with my previous Ubuntu installation which allowed me either to use Windows XP or Ubuntu.

I don't actually have a Windows XP partition on the system so I 'faked' it on this example. \nFor this I would assume that my Windows XP is installed on /dev/sda6 This will be important for the following step. \nNow we need to create a custom menu item for GRUB\nOpen terminal and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nyou can substitute gedit with your favorite editor but it needs to be run as sudo to be able to edit the file. \nadd the following to the very end of the 40_custom file (if the file is completely blank then you typed in something wrong or you don't have grub2 and these instructions will not work for you... double check to see if you have a /etc/grub.d folder) \nmenuentry \"Windows XP\" {\nset root=(hd0,6)\nchainloader (hd0,6)+1\n}\n\nExplanation for this entry... you will need to change the hd0,6 in the entries to match your Windows partition. The hd0 refers to sda, if you have more than one hard drive and your windows partition is on sdb then you would need to use hd1 instead but for you, I'm assuming that you are on sda which you determined by the fdisk command you ran earlier. The ,6 in my example is because we determined that the Windows installation was on /dev/sda6 - sda(hd0)6\nOnce you modified the 40_custom file it should look something like this \n#!/bin/sh\nexec tail -n +3 $0\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.

Is there any way I could try and add windows 7 onto the Ubuntu desktop without having to take Ubuntu off first, or deleting all the information on the computer if I put windows 7 and it then takes priority. I'm not sure how much of that made sense, but if anyone knows another method of dual booting windows 7 and Ubuntu that would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Use gparted to shrink Ubuntu partition and make enough unallocated space for windows. Insert Windows installation DVD or USB. Power on the PC and bring BIOS menu to boot into Windows installer. During installation go to advanced option, create new primary drive in unallocated space and install Windows in that drive. Be careful to not touch the Ubuntu drive. Proceed with installation. After installation is complete you have both Windows and Ubuntu on your PC. To switch between them you have to shutdown the PC. Then power it on and bring the BIOS menu. Then change the boot order.

So, I have read several questions - with and without answers - and though this is similar to others, I have found nothing particular to the issues I am experiencing. It is a three-part problem and I think they're all related erego why they are being posed as a single question.\n\n\n*\n\n*My desktop icons are all on my secondary display and I can't move them back.\n\n*I can no longer maximize windows on my primary display by dragging them to the top of the screen, this results in them being dragged to a desktop with no display that shouldn't be an accessible area anyway.\n\n*After hours of searching for solutions, I was finally able to write a script that will create and assign the proper resolution and position to my secondary display, and leave it alone if it isn't connected. The catch there is that I have to log in first, so prior to login I am stuck with a sideways login screen that is, oddly enough, on my secondary display.\n\n\nI am using an older VAIO laptop with a VGA output (hence the need to create the proper resolution for my external monitor) and running Ubuntu MATE 16.04. \nHere's a screen shot:\n\nAnd here's my script: feel free to do whatever you want with it. It may be of use to people with display configuration issues.\n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --auto\ncvt 1920 1080\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --rotate right\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --pos 0x1281 --output VGA1 --pos 1281x0\nxrandr --auto\n\n\nA: I fixed this in in Display settings (System Settings --> Display). The three monitors I use are different sizes, but after dragging the monitors so that they were aligned along the bottom axis, my icons returned my primary monitor on the left \nLike this\n\n\nA: I am running Gnome and have a dual monitor setup.  If I hit Alt+Space a menu pops up on my primary display and \"Move to Monitor Right\" or \"Move to Monitor Left\" is highlighted.  Click that selection and the icons move to the other screen.\n\nA: I wrote the iconic script to give control over which monitor icons are placed on. It also ensures icons don't get placed into the \"black hole\" that exists when monitors of different resolutions are used.\nHere are a few screenshots of iconic to give you an idea of how it works.\niconic Monitors Notebook General Tab screenshot\n\nOn this notebook tab you can also specify the number of seconds a test will last. Press the Test button to place icons on the Desktop using currently defined each time you change the reserved screen space.\niconic Monitors Notebook Monitor 3 tab\n\nAssign a user friendly name to each monitor. Set the number of rows and columns to utilize for icon placement on each monitor.\nUse the Test button to view what icon placement after number or columns and/or rows are changed.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04, I solved this problem by duplicating desktop icons in the desktop folder: link1, link2,... and link1(copy), link2(copy), for instance. Then I place the duplicate icons as I wish in the two desktops with respect to the two monitors. Everything is fine even if I do monitor manipulations or reboot, etc... \nIn your case, if you have three monitors, you need three links for the same thing in the desktop folder.\n\nA: solved, right click on task-bar, under taskbar tab (box that opens) under 'multiple displays' panel, tick 'Show taskbar on all displays' -> in drop down box below box you just ticked is called ' Show task bar buttons on:' select 'All taskbars'.  click apply, \nproblem solved.\n\nA: Struggled with this and couldn't find an answer through searching. However, I discovered that the Gnome Tweak Tool took care of this. Just open the Desktop tab, and turn Icons off and on.  They jumped right back to the left hand, primary monitor.  Plus there are lots of other good tweaks in the tool. \n\nA: The 'Ugly fix' works well. \n\n\n*\n\n*File Manager > Desktop >\n\n*In this file manager don't hesitate to resize the window to fit the icon to your liking.\n\n*Then Ctrl+A to select all icons\n\n*Then drag&drop into your desktop display of you choice.\n\n\nA: My problem was solved with “Lock panel/Unlock panel”\nMy panels were locked, and when I have added additional display to mu configuration, all locked panels stayed on new display.\nI did:\n\n*\n\n*unlock all panels\n\n*move them to my preferred display\n\n*lock them again\n\n*save display configuration\n\nthat helped.\n\nA:  The Issue\nIcons stay in the top blank black spot of the smaller display (usually laptop)\n\n✅ Ugly Fix\nFile Manager > Desktop > Drag icons to the smaller display & they will relocate\n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: Very quick\n\n*Cons: Repeat every time a new icon is added\n\n", "Q: Why won't Ubuntu let me create a user account named \"games\"? I downloaded the source for \"nethack\", and it suggests I create a user and group named \"games\".  But when I click on (gear symbol) -> System settings -> User accounts from the menu bar, Ubuntu will not allow me to create a user account named \"games\".  When I type that name in, the \"Create\" button grays out.  Yet the same window clearly shows me that my name is the only user account that already exists on the machine.  What is the problem and how do I get around it?\n\nA: Games is a standard system userid on Debian-based systems.  There are many of these with UIDs < 1000.  This allows the system to setup services with minimal privileges.  This follows the least privilege model.  \n", "Q: What do the various % (percent)-parameters in context-menu actions or .desktop files mean? I'm talking about things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*%B\n\n*%f\n\n*%F\n\n*%d\n\n*%D\n\n*etc.\n\n\nWhat do they mean and how are they used?   I'm looking either for a link to a tutorial, or somebody can post a comprehensive list for me here.\nThe goal is to add context menus to Pcmanfm/Lubuntu (assuming it's possible).  If not possible with Pcmanfm, I'd try with another file manager.\nI briefly tried Thunar and there was a list of parameters on it's action tool, but the list wasn't complete and I didn't understand the usage of some of the codes (I did read the tutorial).  The information assumes a level of knowledge a little greater than mine.  (Although I used context menus heavily in Windows, I generally used just one %-type parameter -- %s if I recall correctly.)  So I'm looking for a master list and a comprehensive tutorial that explains usage of the parameters in Linux/Ubuntu.\nThanks. \n\nA: A minimal list of these strings are defined in the section on the Exec key of the Desktop Entry specifications. The non-deprecated ones:\n\n*\n\n*%f  A single file name, even if multiple files are selected. If an application cannot handle multiple file arguments, the system must recognize this, and if it does, it will probably need to create and execute multiple copies of the application for each selected file. If files are not on the local file system (i.e. are on HTTP or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local file system and %f will be expanded to point at the temporary file. Used for programs that do not understand the URL syntax.\n\n*%F  A list of files. Use for apps that can open several local files at once. Each file is passed as a separate argument to the executable program.\n\n*%u  A single URL. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.\n\n*%U  A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to the executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or as file path.\n\n*%i  The Icon key of the desktop entry expanded as two arguments, first --icon and then the value of the Icon key. Should not expand to any arguments if the Icon key is empty or missing.\n\n*%c  The translated name of the application as listed in the appropriate Name key in the desktop entry. If the Name key is missing, the .desktop filename without extension will probably be used.\n\n*%k  The location of the desktop file as either a URI (if for example gotten from the vfolder system) or a local filename or empty if no location is known.\n\nNot all of these make sense for custom actions. The LXDE Wiki suggests PCManFM supports only these.\nDeprecated ones:\n\n*\n\n*%d\n\n*%D\n\n*%n\n\n*%N\n\n*%v\n\n*%m\nNautilus Actions extends these to include a few more items, and I think most file managers follow that as a convention. Aside from those listed above, it adds:\n\n*\n\n*%b  (first) basename\n\n*%B  space-separated list of basenames\n\n*%c  count of selected items\n\n*%d  (first) base directory\n\n*%D  space-separated list of base directory of each selected items\n\n*%h  hostname of the (first) URI\n\n*%m  mimetype of the (first) selected item\n\n*%M  space-separated list of the mimetypes of the selected items\n\n*%n  username of the (first) URI\n\n*%o  no-op operator which forces a  form of execution when specified as first parameter, ignored else\n\n*%O  no-op operator which forces a  form of execution when specified as first parameter, ignored else\n\n*%p  port number of the (first) URI\n\n*%s  scheme of the (first) URI\n\n*%w  (first) basename without the extension\n\n*%W  space-separated list of basenames without their extension\n\n*%x  (first) extension\n\n*%X  space-separated list of extensions\n\n*%%  the « % » character\n\nThunar Actions supports even fewer - the ones it supports are listed in the dialog for adding actions:\n\n*\n\n*%f  The path to the first selected file\n\n*%F  The paths to all the selected files\n\n*%d  Directory containing the file referred to by %f\n\n*%D  Directories containing the files referred to by %F\n\n*%n  The first selected filename, without the path\n\n*%N  All the selected filenames, without paths\n\nBoth Nautilus and Thunar use specifiers which are deprecated by the Desktop Entry spec. They also use different meanings for %n.\nDolphin supports the following options in addition to the main list:\n\n*\n\n*%d base directories of the selected files as separated arguments. behavior as in %f\n\n*%D base directories of the selected files as a single space-separated argument\n\n*%n basename of selected files as separated arguments. behavior as in %f\n\n*%N basenames of the selected files as a single space-separated argument\n\n*%m is similar to %f\n\nIf an unsupported parameter is used, Dolphin sends it simply as a string (e.g. \"%M\") and appends the paths to the selected files to it, as in %f.\nIf no one parameter is used, Dolphin still sends the paths to the selected files, as in %f.\n\nTo summarise, it seems the only common point between the Desktop Entry Spec, Nautilus Actions and Thunar is %f/%F. %f is used to specify a single file, and %F to specify a list of files.\n", "Q: How to Overcome Partitions On Flash that can not be removed, as a result of using the software \"Startup disk Creator\"?

Ubuntu 16.04 uses AMD Radeon OpenCL drivers (called \"AMDGPU-PRO\").\nAs a result of this huge switch over (done by AMD) to move away from their proprietary drives and instead use OpenCL drivers (which in the long-run is great of course and NVIDIA hasn't made the jump to OpenCL yet) they (AMD) are behind on coding full featured drivers for their products in OpenCL.

I've installed xfce as my desktop environment using the following command:\napt-get install xubuntu-desktop xfce4\n\nHowever, the Graphical User Interface doesn't look as expected.  Please have a look at the two images below.  The first image is the GUI that got installed by running the command above.  It's not appealing, being too raw, and it uses xterm as the terminal which I don't like.  The second image shows the GUI that I would much rather install.  Apparently, both GUI's use xfce as the desktop environment as per the instructions on the tutorial.  However, no matter what I try, I can't get the GUI to look like the one on the second image.  Any suggestions on how to install the GUI displayed on the second link below?  Am I missing anything?\nI would appreciate any feedback.\nBad looking GUI:\n\nGood looking GUI:\n\n\nA: First you don't want to install xubuntu-desktop xfce4 but apt-get install xubuntu-desktop^.  The first way pulls in tons of extra \"recommended\" packages (like extra untiy, gnome, qt, kde, and xscreensaver stuff) that can  make the experience sub-par.  The second way uses the xubuntu-desktop task that is more inline with how the xubuntu installation media is created.\nThen you need to move or delete the ~/.config/xfce directory.  This will cause a brand new set of XFCE defaults to be created that match the \"Good Looking GUI\".\nYou'll want to do this at a virtual terminal preferably not in a broken GUI session.\nI'd recommend rebooting after doing all of this so that the graphical greeter is used.\nOn the initial login via graphical login make sure to choose xubuntu-session.\nThis is based on what I had to do to get a decent XFCE desktop on Ubuntu 14.04 Server.\n", "Q: Laptop screen dimming after (? random) period 14.04 We have a Lenovo X220 and an X230 both running Ubuntu 14.04. \nIntermittently, and for no obvious reason, after opening the lid and resuming, for which we require passwords, the backlight will dim to a low level.

In order to configure the boot process if the firmware was incompatible the software should tell you and then abort the install. \nI would however back up the computer first and have an Ubuntu live CD ready just in case something goes wrong.

Can I somehow make this automatically, so when someone issue an apt-get install my-package apt automatically installs the 3.2.2 version from my repository?\n\nA: This can't be done with just the dependencies on your package. Without special configuration, apt-get always prefers the highest version available, so, even if your package depends on python-cherrypy3 (<< 3.2.5), it will pick the highest version of python-cherrypy3 available. And since Ubuntu 15.10 and above have only 3.5.0+, that's what you'll get.\nWhat you can do is provide a 3.2.5 version packaged of python-cherrypy3 in your personal repository, which uses an epoch number, so that it is preferred over the newer package.

Therefore, it seems that my installation using apt-get has not overrided my original installation using Software Centre.\nSo, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this mean that there are actually two different versions of TexMaker both installed on my machine?\n\n*If I were to install TexMaker only with apt-get, how could I get the icon on the desktop sidebar?\nThanks!\n\nA: Ubuntu Software application installation\nThe Ubuntu Software application has a Graphical User Interface to let you search for programs and give you some information about them, but when you click the 'install' button it is basically running the command sudo apt-get install packagename\nAs Mark Kirby & JonasCz have already stated, installing from the Ubuntu Software application or typing the sudo apt-get install command are just two different ways of doing the same thing.\nOne advantage of the GUI method is that it will place a launcher icon of your newly installed program into the Unity launcher for you. \nIf you use the sudo apt-get install command, and then want the Launcher icon for the program in the Unity Launcher, you need to search for the program with the Dash and then drag it onto the Launcher yourself. \nIn this case, it would appear that TexMaker and 'texlive-full' are different programs and would have different Launcher icons, so the TexMaker icon from your first Ubuntu Software installation of the program will continue to launch TexMaker and will not have been replaced by 'texlive-full'.\n[Incidentally, it's possible that the program TeXstudio (found in Ubuntu Software) may have the functionality that you are after]\nEdit:\nUpon further investigation (I'm unfamiliar with TexMaker & 'texlive-full') it seems that 'texlive-full' is described as 'TeX Live: metapackage pulling in all components of TeX Live'. Whether this means it installs a separate program called 'Tex Live' or is supposed to add some functionality to TexMaker is unclear to me. There is no mention of 'TexMaker' in the Texlive package information: http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/texlive-full\nFurther Edit: Nick Weimberg has a much clearer explanation in the comments: \"TexMaker is a GUI program for writing LaTeX. TexLive is a collection of LaTeX packages that don't include a GUI, but are required for much LaTeX functionality. They are separate software programs and separate packages\" - A program that doesn't have a GUI will not always have a Launcher, in which case you would run the program from the Terminal - a command such as programname --help or man programname should inform you of how to use it\nGetting the Launcher Icon after a sudo apt-get install command\nOpen the Unity Dash by clicking the Ubuntu Icon at the top of the Launcher or by pressing the 'Super' key.\nThe 'Super' key is the 'Windows' key on most PC's or the 'Command' key on a Mac.\nIf you type the name of the program you just installed into the dash ('tex' should be close enough for it to find it) it should show an icon that you can select to launch the program right there and then. You can also drag the icon onto the Launcher to keep it in the Launcher for easy access.\nIf you can't find your program by typing the name into the Dash, then at the bottom of the 'Dash page' are a couple of different icons: 'Home', 'Applications', 'Files', 'Videos', 'Music', 'Photos'.\nSelecting 'Applications' will let you browse through all your installed applications and you should be able to find it there.\nThe quickest way to go straight to searching through your applications is to hold Super + A at the same time.\n", "Q: Install kde on ubuntu 14.04 My company gave me a laptop setup with ubuntu 14.04.

When system uses almost whole RAM and there are some less used applications, core moves to the SWAP partition in order to save RAM space. What is more, if you hibernate your computer, whole content of RAM is placed to SWAP. That's why it should be at least the size as your RAM.\nIf you feel like you lost too much space, you can easily corrext it via liveCD or liveUSB. Simply boot in live mode and open gparted (if not installed, install it by typing into terminal sudo apt install gparted).\nThere you can make changes to your existing partitions. In general, try not to touch /boot partition. Also, don't forget to make SWAP as big as your RAM (or twice the big, if you have less than 4GBs of RAM).\nIf you would need help with gparted, follow this simple guide \nhttp://gparted.org/display-doc.php%3Fname%3Dhelp-manual\n\nA: SWAP = Virtual RAM, extension for the physical RAM, used only when needed. Swap concept is nothing new, it is used by Windows too, but in a different form.  \nIn Windows, when RAM is fully used (100%), it will automatically be extended by using free space on C:\\ partition. If C:\\ is fully used, the mechanism of extended RAM fails and Windows get stuck on blue screens. You can manually assign Windows to use free space from other partitions as swap, but that's a rather difficult task (and dangerous) for the usual user. \nSwap in linux is smarter than that, by keeping swap space in a reserved (separated) partition, always available to get into action, whenever necessary.\n\nA: Swap partitions are used to create a bigger working area than system RAM, they are mostly not needed now that RAM is cheap and plentiful.\nOne other use for swap is as the storage for suspend/hibernate modes, without a swap partition you won't be able to do that.\n", "Q: What is Suitable pageUp Key in Ubuntu 16.04 of Macbook Air?

So how do you tell if it is possible on your laptop?\n\nA: Controlling the fan speed using fancontrol is not possible with many laptops because of the design of the fan control hardware. So how do you tell if it is possible on your laptop? I am going to use an example of an MSI GS60 laptop to show the steps to take to find out. I also intend to update this answer with the results of answering this sort of question so you may find out instantly from this answer.\nFirst the safest and often the best way of controlling the fan speed is to use the BIOS, not fancontrol. If you are having issues with a fan that runs too slowly or too fast it is important to determine if there is an underlying problem causing this. Fans running too fast is often a sign of a power management issue that needs to be resolved in the BIOS or by installing tlp or laptop-mode tools. It can also be caused by a fan or vent clogged with dust.\nStep 1 determine the exact model of your laptop. sudo dmidecode | grep -A 9 \"System Information\"\nStep 2 Go to the manufacturers website and read the owners manual. For the MSI G60 it is here. This shows that some models of this laptop have a \"cooler boost\" button that controls the fan speed. It also shows that pressing Fn+F5 cycles the laptop through different power management modes. If I was the user of this laptop I would stop here as this is a fast reliable method of controlling the fan speed and performance.\nStep 3 Determine the chipset used on the laptop's motherboard. In the Owners Manual this is given as \"Intel Lynx Point HM8 series\". Now if you google this the top hit takes you to a page showing that the chipset may be any one of a number of products. We need to find the exact product used. If you are the user of the laptop lspci will tell you this information. I cant do this. Next try the specifications page on the manufacturers site. This states it is Intel HM87.\nStep 4. Read the datasheet for the HM87 chipset on Intel's Website here. This may take you a while as it has 822 pages. The index tells us that PWM is on page 247 and this immediately states (Server/Workstation Only). If you read the introduction it is clear that this chipset comes in three versions mobile, workstation and server. As you have a laptop you have the mobile version and thus there is no PWM hardware for Ubuntu to use to control the fan speed. This is a deliberate decision as manufacturers don't want laptops returned under warranty when a user has been doing high utilisation tasks but has turned the fan off as it was too noisy.\nStep 5. If it is not already there update the following table.\nChipset               PWM hardware     Used in  \nIntel H76 (mobile)    No               Asus K75VM \nIntel HM97 (mobile)   No               MSI G60\nIntel Q87 (mobile)    No               Lenovo T540p\nIntel QM87            No\n\n", "Q: Changing KDE's oxygen-gtk3 colors for tooltips (fixing Firefox 46) I use KDE (Kubuntu 14.04), the Oxygen theme and Firefox, and FF46 has several bugs with GTK3, the most annoying being displaying tooltips as dark text over a barely darker background.  \nSo I'am looking for a temporary change in them settings to either have the text in white (but I think the problem is that FF46 isn't using the theme color) or having a lighter background.\nAs far as I can't tell the tooltip background is not even a solid color but a vertical gradient, from roughly 60,53,48 at the top to 42,37,33 at the bottom and I cannot relate these to some contents of the theme in /usr/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-3.0/ (kdeglobals, oxygenrc or the two CSS files).\nSo, where are these colors defined?\n\nA: You can change the colour in the System Settings, which will fix it for all applications, not just Firefox.\nOn Kubuntu 14.04 LTS:\nSystem Settings > Application Appearance > Colours (side selection) > Colours (the tab) > Tooltip Background and Tooltip Text\n", "Q: How do I install missing manpages in a chroot running in Ubuntu Touch? I am on the new Ubuntu tablet from bq, in a terminal, running in a chroot jail.\nI have installed man-db, manpages, manpages-dev, and even ubuntu-docs.\nBut while man man works, or man gpp or other things I installed manually, basic manpages are missing and undocumented. man less doesn't work, nor man ls or man apt-get. \nHow do I get these installed as well?\n\nA: The man pages and man tool simply need be installed, and you need to be running the command within the chroot after doing sudo chroot . inside its root directory.\nIf man pages aren't working, then likely there is some other underlying issue, such as the files have somehow been removed from disk. I just tested here on my Nexus 4, and man ls in the chroot works just fine.\n", "Q: Changing desktop background in bash I wanted to make a bash script that takes a random picture from a folder and sets it as the desktop background. I figured out the algorithm (it's not hard) but I can't find a command that would change the background picture if you give it the path to the picture. \nI found gconftool for bash 2.~ and gsettings for bash 3.~, but i have GNU bash, version 4.3.42(1)-release on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and these don't work.\n\nA: Assuming you're using standard Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity, you can use the following command to set the wallpaper:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///home/username/path/to/image.jpg\"\n\nYou should also look at Variety wallpaper changer - it does the same thing as what you want to do with a shell script, with a lot of features and options.\n\nA: I've done it like this:\ntargetDir=\"/home/username/Photos\"\n\n\nfunction get_next_photo() {\n    # Returns a random file form targetdir\n    files=( \"$targetDir\"/* )\n    echo \"${files[RANDOM % ${#files[@]}]}\"\n}\n\nfunction set_background() {\n    # Takes an absolute file path as argument.

Things work fine but now I'd like to be able to back up and recover (just in case).  I've got two 1 TB hard drives and I see that I have Ubuntu on one and Win on the other.  Is there a way to combine both on to one drive, so I can use the freed up drive to image or clone the drive containing Ubuntu & Win?  If I could possibly avoid a re-install that would be preferred.\n\nA: It sounds like it would be possible, but it will take some time. Now I have never done exactly what your trying to do, but what I would do is use the GParted live CD and shrink down the partitions on both hard drives so that both or all the partions would fit on one drive. Then on the drives check which one has the boot label most likely the one with Ubuntu is my guess since your using grub. Then you would want to use a cloning tool(Like CloneZilla) and copy the other hard disk onto the one that has a partition marked with the boot flag. make sure and copy all the partitions as it will most likely mess up if you don't. After that you'll need to boot into Ubuntu and do a grub update(You can look up on google how to do it is really easy. You should be ready after that.\n", "Q: Gaining root privs within LiveCD, for drive mounted in /media/[user]? So, here is my scenario, for a recent version of Lubuntu.  (I've tried tapping Lubuntu forums for help, that was a no-go.)\nMy hard drive is beginning to fail, according to the disk tool I load within the LiveCD environment.  Therein, I can mount the drive and access it from /media/[user]. I can navigate my usual folders, open media, etc... but I cannot copy it so as to rescue my documents.\nHow do I gain admin privileges?  I used to use gksu pcmanfm or gksudo pcmanfm but that was with the original drive already mounted.  I trust there is a slight variation to my needed approach?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There is an interesting bug feature in ubuntu live-CDs(USBs): they require you to use root if you want to modify files on the hard drive. The joke is that root on live-CDs doesn't have a password! Therefore:\nSOLUTION: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo lubuntu_default_filemanager\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Perform rescue operations. \n", "Q: wrong video resolution with AMD HD7560D and ubuntu 16.04 I have a computer with AMD A8-5600K APU which includes the GPU HD7560D.\nI use a VGA monitor with max resolution of 1280x1024.\nThen I updated ubuntu to 16.04, unaware of the documented decision to drop support for fglrx drivers. \nAnyway I don't need gaming features or fancy graphics, just my full resolution back. After the update instead, I get max 1024x768 and I had to put nomodeset (or radeon.modeset=0) as kernel parameters.\nThen, I wanted to know if radeon, ati or amdgpu are the correct drivers to use. I couldn't find a clear documentation. Here the GPU spec:\nlspci | grep VGA\n00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Trinity [Radeon HD 7560D]\n\nAnybody knows which driver should I use ?\nAnd how to get a full resolution?\n\nA: Try specifying the boot resolution in \n\n/etc/default/grub\n\nunder GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024. Remember to sudo update-grub to get the settings fixed to the boot process.\nI found this to be the only thing that helped with my AMD-A10-APU system. For the time being the drivers that are installed by default work fine for me, though the performance may be different for you.\n", "Q: gedit not opening any file when launched from terminal, not only system files My gedit application is working as normal when I launch it from launch menu and I can do all the kind of things.\nHowever when I go to terminal and issue the following command:\ngedit text1\n\nThen I get the following output:\nFailed to connect to Mir: Failed to connect to server socket: No such file or directory\n\nUnable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused\n\n(gedit:3825): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:\n\nHowever the application vim is working as normal.\nThis is very frustrating as I normally work in terminal and rarely use GUI except for gedit\nIt may be noted that today I have installed openssh server. And henceafter I am facing this problem. Why is this happening\n\nA: @rancho since i am new user to askubuntu, i can't comment on your question... \nAll i know whenever you log-in into ssh server, you cannot open gedit due to DISPLAY error as stated in the link of @JonasCz. And the reason it worked after you rebooted your system because you automatically logged out from openssh server. \nWhenever you want to log out the openssh server after login, simply logout the ssh using \"exit\" command and then use gedit.. \nThank you\n", "Q: How might I run web browsers from separate spaces (sandboxing)? Situation: In web development I need to be logged into an application as an administrator, normal user, unauthenticated user etc. I'd like to have a set up where each browser window is unaware of the other's logged in session. \nQuestion: How can I have multiple browser windows open but have them running from different profiles or different cache areas? If firefox profiles, how can I achieve this without using the Profile editor UI?\nCan I create a temporary user, run Firefox, then just throw away the entirety of that user account?

How does ls -l format its output so that column contents line up neatly?\n\n\nA: The source code of ls is available for browsing online on GNU Savannah. In most cases, the required maximum width is computed (for example, using the mbswidth function for text), and then uses the classic C printf function format specifiers and some manual padding. See, for example, the functions format_user_or_group(), and gobble_file().\nTL; DR: there's no \"magic\", just a lot of grunt computation.\n\nIf you want such neat tables for your own output, use column:\n$ grep -vE '^#' /etc/fstab\nUUID=cdff3742-9d03-4bc1-93e3-ae50708474f2 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n/dev/mapper/lvmg-homelvm /home           btrfs   defaults,compress=lzo,space_cache,relatime 0       2\nUUID=\"bb76cd0d-ae1d-4490-85da-1560c32679cd\" none    swap sw 0 0\nUUID=\"a264b1b1-cf82-40aa-ab9e-a810cfba169a\" /home/muru/arch     btrfs defaults,compress=lzo,space_cache,relatime 0       2\n\n$ grep -vE '^#' /etc/fstab | column -t\nUUID=cdff3742-9d03-4bc1-93e3-ae50708474f2    /                ext4   errors=remount-ro                           0  1\n/dev/mapper/lvmg-homelvm                     /home            btrfs  defaults,compress=lzo,space_cache,relatime  0  2\nUUID=\"bb76cd0d-ae1d-4490-85da-1560c32679cd\"  none             swap   sw                                          0  0\nUUID=\"a264b1b1-cf82-40aa-ab9e-a810cfba169a\"  /home/muru/arch  btrfs  defaults,compress=lzo,space_cache,relatime  0  2\n\n\nA: In addition to @muru 's answer, here is the part of the source code which calculates  width for right justification of output. :\nstatic void\nformat_user_or_group (char const *name, unsigned long int id, int width)\n{\n  size_t len;\n\n  if (name)\n    {\n      int width_gap = width - mbswidth (name, 0);\n      int pad = MAX (0, width_gap);\n      fputs (name, stdout);\n      len = strlen (name) + pad;\n\n      do\n        putchar (' ');\n      while (pad--);\n    }\n  else\n    {\n      printf (\"%*lu \", width, id);\n      len = width;\n    }\n\n  dired_pos += len + 1;\n}\n\nIt uses, printf (\"%*lu \", width, id); . NOTE :  variable field width specifier ‘*’\nIn this case, it cannot be predicted how large a field width we will need when ls -l is executed, i.e, The names of directories may vary in length . This implies that the field width itself needs to be a variable, for which the program will compute a value.\nC uses an asterisk in the position of the field width specifier to indicate to printf that it will find the variable that contains the value of the field width as an additional parameter. \nFor instance, assume that the current value of width is 5. The statement:\nprintf (\"%*d%*d\\n\", width, 10, width, 11);\n\nwill print: (note the spacing)\n   10   11\n\n", "Q: How do I get an Xbox One controller to work with 16.04 (not Steam) I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 and I downloaded a game from GOG called Transistor.

E.g. you have /home/username/image/wallpaper/mypic.jpg Ensure that all dirs have rwxr-xr-x permission and the file have rw-r--r--. That was enough for me in addition to check LightDM GTK+ Greeter settings \"Use user wallpaper if available\" should be checked.\n", "Q: Share Wired Ethernet Internet Connection via Wifi Adapter to Connect from Android I am using ubuntu 14.04 with kde plasma and i want to share my wired ethernet internet connection via my realtek RTL8188eu Wifi adapter so i can connect and browse internet from my android Samsung Galaxy Grand i9082 that is running cyanogenmod 11 \nshady@shady:~$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

I have installed virtualenv to run a different version of Python than the system Python for my django app. I installed Python 2.7.11 using the method described here.

If you want to have specific versions of Python itself, it would probably be beneficial to look, instead, into Docker containers. Docker containers are capable of what you are describing.\nAlternatively you can install the 2.7.11 version of Python somewhere local:\nwget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/Python-2.7.11.tgz\ntar -zxvf Python-2.7.11.tgz\ncd Python-2.7.11\nmkdir ~/.localpy\n./configure prefix=/home/$USER/.localpy\nmake\nmake install\n\nThen, modify your virtualenv to include -p /home/$USER/.localpy/bin/python2.7\n", "Q: How to make Fingerprint reader of Dell latitude e6510 work on ubuntu 16.04 I want to make the fingerprint reader work.\nCan you please help.\nI seems like the system detects the fingerprint sensor\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 005: ID 0a5c:5801 Broadcom Corp.

I've been trying to set up a dual boot with Ubuntu on my Windows 10 HP Pavilion G6 Laptop for a couple of days now. I've followed countless tutorials, on here, and on Google.\nI manage to install ubuntu onto my laptop using a USB stick, but after installation when the computer is restarted, it loads straight back to Windows (with no sign of a grub menu). I've gone through the boot options, trying all options, and loading multiple efi files direct, but with no luck of loading back onto ubuntu.\nHere is my process -\n1 - Shrink the Windows part of my computer to allow room for Ubuntu. Here  is what my disk management looks like after making space for Ubuntu.\n2 - I put Ubuntu onto a USB stick using the software from Pen Drive Linux.\n3 - I restart my computer, and boot from the USB. When the computer boots, in the list of boot options the USB is shown twice. One has a UEFI in the name, and the other doesn't. I have tried both these options.\n4 - When the Ubuntu installer loads, I press install.\n5 - I go through a couple of screens. On one of the screens, the tutorials all say there is an option to install alongside Windows 10, but i've never seem to have this. So I Choose the 'Something else' option.\n6 - On the something else page, i find the free space part that i removed from windows, and make some partitions. \n  6.1 - I make a swap area of 4000mb \n  6.2 - A root ( / ) one of 30000mb \n  6.3 - A /home one of 30000mb\n7 - I press continue, and finish the installation.\n8 - It now says that i have to restart the computer. I do so and it boots back to Windows.\nOther things that I have tried - Changing the power options so that quick start is turned off, turned off safe mode in the BIOS.\nIs there anything that I am missing?\nAny help would be really appreciated.\nThanks :)\n\nA: Before doing anything else, this answer might already help you.\n1. EFI-Boot\nYou need to make sure the USB-drive boots in EFI-mode. If you can, disable legacy boot / legacy BIOS in your \"BIOS\".\nNow boot from your USB-key and run the live-system. Inside the live-system open a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and run efibootmgr. This should show you all EFI bootmanagers in your nvram and which one is the default. On my Mac it looks like this:\nBootCurrent: 0001\nBootOrder: 0001,0000,0080\nBoot0000* ubuntu\nBoot0001* rEFInd Boot Manager\nBoot0080* Mac OS X\nBootFFFF* \n\nIf you don't see a line for ubuntu or anything at all, your USB-key wasn't created to be EFI bootable and/or Ubuntu was not installed in EFI mode.\nIf you do see Ubuntu but it isn't the first in the bootorder, first try to boot it temporarily to try if grub works:\nsudo efibootmgr --bootnext 0000\n\nThis tells the EFI to boot Ubuntu next and then revert to the default. The HEX-number might be different in your case. Refer to the output of efibootmgr.\nTo make the changes permanent, use efibootmgr to change the default boot order.\nsudo efibootmgr --bootorder 0000,0001,0080\n\nAdjust this to your needs as well.\n2. Creating the USB-key the right way\nIf your USB-key didn't boot in EFI mode, you need to create it that way. First, lets figure out what kind of partitioning you use.\nIn your Disk Management tool in Windows, right-click on Disk 0, select Properties and go to the Volumes tab. The partition style entry will tell you whether you have an MBR or a GPT boot record. Make a note of this.\nDownload the Ubuntu ISO and create your USB-Stick using Rufus. In Rufus you can select the target partition and system type. Select GPT and EFI there (or MBR if that was your partitioning scheme).\n3. Install\nWhen installing, boot into the live-system first, run gparted to create at least 3 partitions: root (~20G), swap (~the size of your ram) and home (the rest). Use the \"Something different\" install option and pick our previously created partitions.\n\nA: My few cents:\na. You need to install both in uefi mode. W10 should already be installed in uefi. To do that for linux you must boot your usb stick in efi mode and then install normally.\nb. Don't make so many separate partitions for linux, use Logical Volume Management -LVM- (encrypted is even better) and combine root, swap and home into one primary partition. You can then set them inside the LVM as logical volumes on your volume group.\nc. If you follow (b), you will also need one boot partition outside the lvm (that cannot be encrypted). \nd. Download an efi shell and have a look at your efi partition. There are many ways to do it, check your bios settings also.\ne. On your efi partition you can install an EFI boot loader such as refind. There are many others though, and many ways to go from there, with stubs etc.\nHope I helped a bit..\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Port forwading troooble 2 x NIC I am trying to setup a Gateway / Firewall between our router and Windows AD network!

I currently use Ubuntu-Mate 16.04 LTS and love it.  I have it set up perfectly to fit my needs.  I also frequently check DistroWatch to see what other distros are being developed and released out of sheer curiosity.\nRecently, I found the new beta release of AntiX 16-b5 and gave it a shot in VirtualBox.  I am so impressed and I'd like to know if there's a way I could add all the Window Managers and combination Window Managers that AntiX uses with my Ubuntu-Mate system.\nIn case the link above did not work, here's a list of the WMs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rox-Fluxbox\n\n*Space-Fluxbox\n\n*Fluxbox\n\n*Min-Fluxbox\n\n*Rox-IceWM\n\n*Space-IceWM\n\n*IceWM\n\n*Min-IceWM\n\n*Rox-JWM\n\n*Space-JWM\n\n*JWM\n\n*Min-JWM\n\n*Herbstluftwm\n\n\nIs this possible?  If so, how can I go about doing it?\nThanks a lot!\n~ Ev\n\nA: Short answer: no, you cannot. Not easily, at least.\nThe the items in your list aren't discrete, separate, window managers. Item #1 for instance (rox-fluxbox) relies on an antix script to both initiate a fluxbox (window manager) session and set rox as desktop manager. The underlying script also sets rox-filer as preferred file manager and handles any session autostart apps.\nFor use on top of your existing ubuntu, to achieve all those login choices you would, AT A MINIMUM, need to install \"icewm\" and \"fluxbox\" (and fbpanel) and \"jwm\"... then install the rox-desktop package (IIRC, includes rox-filer file manager) and install \"spacefm\" file manager. Who can guess whether ubuntu repository has suitable versions of these packages, plus suitable versions of the packages they depend on?\nIf you manage to successfully find/install all of the above WMs etc., you'll still need to tweak their configs to achieve autostarts... and \"fluxbox\" knows nothing about \"rox\". That's where the custom (antix) script(s) come into play. IIRC, those scripts are contained within, and installed by, the package \"antix-desktop-defaults\" which would have been preinstalled in the antix linux ISO. If you're interested, you can browse/study the content of those scripts by visiting github dot com slash antiX-Linux (note: capitalized here to match the URL/path as exists at github)\n", "Q: pyqt Snap builds successful, fails to run I built a snap using python3 plugin.

Also, for whatever reason(knock on wood) Ubuntu seems to run smoother than the Mint did(no idea why. I'm using the same partition as I did for Mint)\nWhat I want to know is why \"Playonlinux\" as well as \"Wine\" is missing from the Ubuntu software center after a fresh install.  Please, be specific when answering as I may follow up with another question if the answer is vague.

I don't know why but it works.\nFirst of all, unlock it from launcher, click the right button on it and you see that option.\nThen open the terminal and type \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \nafter that \nsudo apt-get install software-center\nIf you use ubuntu 16.04 you could just type apt instead of apt-get.\nAnd finally go to /usr/share/applications, find the new ubuntu software center and move it to the launcher.\n\nA: On my 14.04 wine and playonlinux are respectively in the \"universe\" and \"multiverse\" repositories. Check that you have these enabled in your software sources. \n\nA: It seems the new Ubuntu Software app isn't quite ideal. I can find neither Play on Linux nor Wine Windows Program Loader with it. However, If I install Ubuntu Software Center with sudo apt-get install software-center\nand run Ubuntu Software Center instead of Ubuntu Software, both show up if I search wine.\n", "Q: How to Disable Hovering-App-Bar in 16.04?

I know that there is no specific file extension in Ubuntu (Linux), so if I had an application (package) and I want to install it manually (using terminal), how: \n\n\n*\n\n*can I find out which file (extension) to use to install (either using apt-get or another method)?\n\n*if there is more than one file with the same extension (like\ninspect.sh and studio.sh) which one of them is used in the\ninstallation?\n\n\nA: Installation packages have an extension .deb in Ubuntu. You can install a deb package with\nsudo dpkg -i <package_filename.deb>\n\nIn that case you have to know where your package is. Easier way is to use\nsudo apt-get install <package_name>\n\nIn that case Ubuntu makes sure it downloads and installs the package from a verified source. It also installs other packages that are required in order for the installed package to work.\nThe third option is to download some other kind of software (usually source package) in a tar.gz or similar package. You have to unzip it and then look for some README or INSTALL file where instructions for the installation are written. These instructions usually involve compiling\nautomake\n./configure\nmake\n\nand installing\nsudo make install\n\nThis is just an example. Manual installations differ from package to package.\nRegarding extensions. Executable files do not have to have an extension as in Windows. The file permissions tell whether a file is executable or not. Try \"ls -l\". If there are x's in the permissions then it is executable unless it is a directory. In that case x means you can change to this directory.\n\nA: When you install a package with APT, you don't need to specify any extension. All you have to type is the package name, for example \nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nSometimes the exact package name isn't that obvious. Maybe you know you need gtk-doc but when you put that into apt-get install it's not found, in which case, try pressing tab to complete the name, and if that doesn't work, try apt-cache search gtk-doc and you'll see what you want, so you can...\nsudo apt-get install gtk-doc-tools\n\nWhen not using APT you may see packages with a .deb extension. This is the package format used by Debian-based distributions including Ubuntu (the packages downloaded by APT are in this format). You can install .deb files using the dpkg utility by running this command in the directory where the file is (or with the full path):\nsudo dpkg -i <name-of-package>.deb\n\nIt may be a good idea to follow this with sudo apt install -f to resolve dependencies. Alternatively, you can use the recently-added APT feature (note that it requires the path, here just ./ because the file is in the current working directory):\nsudo apt install ./<name-of-package>.deb\n\nThe advantage of using this command is that APT performs dependency resolution.\nOther things you want to install might come in the form of .tar.xz or .tar.gz and so on archives. For these, some general instructions are in How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?, but the specifics will vary widely, and you will need to read the instructions provided by the package maintainer and possibly do further research in those cases.\n", "Q: SSD as /tmp partition I have a Ubuntu 14.04 server which has one drive where rootfs is mounted.\nI just added an SSD disk which I have mounted at /ssd\nNow I want my /tmp & /var/tmp to use this fast drive to speed up my server.

My problem is that for some reason ubuntu automatically has created several dublicates of this directory /media/user/Multimedia2,/media/user/Multimedia3,... \nIt gets really annoying because when a dublicate is created, it seems like ubuntu moves all the content to the newest copy of the folder and then eclipse cannot find the workspace anymore. \nI'm quite new to linux and don't really understand this behaviour.

I'm thinking about splitting our backups to one disk each instead of having them share disks.\nCurrent setup:\n\nserver:/mnt/backup/husband/\nserver:/mnt/backup/wife/\n\non the same drive /dev/sdb are being backed up to rpi:/mnt/external/weekly.X/mnt/backup/... \nWhat I'd like to do is to have:\n\nserver:/mnt/husband/\nserver:/mnt/wife/\n\non separate drives, /dev/sdb/ and /dev/sdc, being backed up to rpi:/mnt/external_hsbd/weekly.X and rpi:/external_wife/weekly.X on separate external drives. \nMy question is really if there is any easy way of splitting the weekly and monthly backups already made to separate drives? If I go about copying all the rpi:/mnt/external/weekly.X/mnt/backup/husband/to the new disk I assume I'd lose all links between weekly.0 and all the older backups? \n\nA: You can mount sdb and sdc on your server at /mnt/backup/husband/ and /mnt/backup/wife \nThat way you can maintain your current settings. I would not worry about names of mount points so much.\n", "Q: Unable to use python3 Unknowingly i deleted the python folders in the / (root) directory, so I got this error when I tried to run python3.  \nI reinstalled python3.2.3 version by manually downlading and installing with the help of read me file.

Greetings I recently upgraded my system to a new motherboarda and a new processor, (well I guess new  everything) except my hard drives, which contain my operating system which is Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\nThe new motherboard is a GIGABYTE Z170N On their website it specifies that it will support Windows operating systems, but there was no mention of Linux or Ubuntu. \nJust wondering if the migration of my system will actually work with this motherboard?\n\nA: Latest Ubuntu 14.04 (14.04.4) uses kernel 4.2 which will probably run with skylake processors (intel 6th gen) but maybe need some configuration (probably nomodeset boot option and upgrade to newer kernel as discussed here No version of Ubuntu can be installed with any Skylake 6th generation Intel processor). The best way to be sure is to write an ubuntu usb live image and choose test ubuntu instead of install. So, I recommend that you try a clean ubuntu 16.04 install which has kernel 4.4 (you can also upgrade to kernel 4.5 or 4.6 series as they supposed to have more skylake fixes and improvements, but they may cause instability to your system).\nKeep in mind that if you use intel graphics there are not any proprietary skylake drivers for linux yet and opensource drivers are at an early stage yet (maybe when 16.04.1 is released there will be better support). Some benchmarks for ubuntu 15.10 (ubuntu 16.04 may be a bit better) are here: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel-skylake-windows&num=2.

I might have to replace my laptop that's running Ubuntu 16.04 from its SSD. The drive is encrypted, and so is the home directory.

I also encrypted my home dir during that original 15.04 installation.\nWill the Ubuntu keep working if I stick the encrypted drive into a different laptop of the same type?\n\nA: Yes, it will.\nIf your SSD is hardware encrypted, the new laptop you're moving it will need to support SED, which, in your case, is no problem, since you will be putting it into another laptop of the same make / model.\nIf you only have home directory encryption (Set up with \"Encrypt my home folder\" during installation), or another form of software-only encryption, you can move your SSD around as you wish, and it will work in any computer.\n", "Q: Failed to start after nvidia-driver install I just installed nvidia-driver via Software Manager in Ubuntu Gnome.\nNow I have rebooted and this is the situation:\n\nWhat's the best way to proceed? \nUninstall nvidia-drivers via CLI?\n\nA: This is a known bug in Ubuntu GNOME :\nIf you find this bug affects you, please mark the same in this bug report :\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-gnome/+bug/1559576 as given below   \n\n\nA: So that it may be able to boot your system:\n $ sudo apt remove nvidia-settings nvidia-prime nvidia-361\n $ sudo reboot\n\nThis is a known bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-gnome/+bug/1559576 which nowadays can't be solved.\n", "Q: Learn how to program/port through Ubuntu Touch I am interested in learning how to program but except for some first tiny steps (like basics of Linux and HTML and getting CM running) I haven't acquired any skills and knowledge yet.

So I am wondering, if porting UT could be a manageable project to learn more about programming (porting)/phones/Ubuntu while getting me UT on a more preferred device and finally contributing to the Ubuntu community or is that a far too optimistic thought?\n\nA: First: You won't need to buy a new phone to learn programming. There is an emulator for both Ubuntu Touch and Android.\nI own a nexus 4. Maybe that is the right device. You can flash Ubuntu Touch and also Android to it. It's also capable of dual-booting, although i did not try that.

At one point in time, manufacturer support for 64-bit drivers was poorer than 32-bit, but this situation is probably the reverse now.\n\nA: Here's some information about arhitectures that you might find useful. There's a link provided at the bottom that leads to a full article.\nWhich is Better - 32 or 64 Bits?\nIf you are doing heavy work where you have started to hit the 4GB memory barrier, then 64-bit is for you. Certain intensive tasks such as encoding video or audio also run significantly faster on 64-bit operating systems (NOTE: this is implementation specific).\nPhoronix has done some testing (2009), comparing 32bit/PAE/64bit, and this seems to indicate that 64bit performs better than 32bit in almost all cases.\nEarly 64-bit adopters were plagued by incompatibility problems (most noticeably Java and Flash), however most issues have now been resolved.\nSome applications such as Flash do run slower in 64-bit mode, however work continues to improve on this.\nOther platforms which also come in 32 and 64-bit flavours may experience more problems especially due to a lack of 64-bit device drivers as incompatible user application. As Ubuntu is entirely open source, this is not the case as all hardware supported by Ubuntu works equally well in 32-bit and 64-bit environments. The same applies to open source user applications as well.\nWhich Should I Choose?\nUnless you have specific reasons to choose 32-bit, we recommend 64-bit to utilise the full capacity of your hardware.\nSource\n\nA: A quick search online would've showed you that it's a 64 system. \n\nA: The Decision \n\nIt depends on you and the central processing unit.\nHow do you know if you have a 64 bit architecture?\nSearch online for the make / model / brand of your PC and find the processor specs. If nothing is telling you \"64-bit\" do an online search for the processor name.\n\nIf you have a 64 bit processor, get the 64-bit version \nHere is why:\nThe 64-bit version is easier to obtain. (Convenient)\nIt is likely a 32-bit application is 64-bit compatible. (Practical) \nApplications like Google Chrome are not 32 bit compatible   (Usable)\nIf you've got a 32-bit processor, get the 32 bit version \nYou don't have a choice.

It's pretty complicated and sometimes the system freezes when I try to download and install wps office. I think it is much more convenient to use the terminal. But I never used installed WPS Office from the command line. That would be great if I could update it using software manager or terminal. Third party deb files are from separate locations. I specifically want to know about WPS\n\nA: OK so...\n32-bit (depending on your hardware - check by uname -a):\ncd && wget -O wps-office.deb http://kdl.cc.ksosoft.com/wps-community/download/a21/wps-office_10.1.0.5672~a21_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i wps-office.deb\nsudo apt-get -f install && rm wps-office.deb\nwget -O web-office-fonts.deb http://kdl.cc.ksosoft.com/wps-community/download/a15/wps-office-fonts_1.0_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i web-office-fonts.deb\n\nFor 64-bit:\ncd && wget -O wps-office.deb http://kdl1.cache.wps.com/ksodl/download/linux/a21//wps-office_10.1.0.5707~a21_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i wps-office.deb\nsudo apt-get -f install && rm wps-office.deb\nwget -O web-office-fonts.deb http://kdl.cc.ksosoft.com/wps-community/download/fonts/wps-office-fonts_1.0_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i web-office-fonts.deb\n\nAnd that's it.\nEdit: As the wget links are likely to break at every version change, you can also visit the download page here as noted by JonasCZ in this comment\n\nA: WPS Office is an office productivity suite, including Writer, Presentation and Spreadsheets. WPS Office is a native snap package in Ubuntu. To install it in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install wps-office  \nsudo snap connect wps-office:removable-media\n\nwps-office-multilang a multilanguage snap package for WPS Office. It is a slightly larger snap package than wps-office which contains the WPS Office Suite and  support for many languages. In order to install wps-office-multilang type:\nsudo snap install wps-office-multilang  \n\nTo list the supported languages of wps-office-multilang run snap info wps-office-multilang.\nThe wps-office snap packages will be updated automatically when updates are available. If you didn't already update it from the terminal you will receive a notification from the Software app to install the latest update when it becomes available.\n", "Q: Where are libertine documents stored? I have been editing documents downloaded from Dropbox in LibreOffice on my M10 tablet, but I can't find the documents in the user space on /phablet/Documents/ etc. Same thing with files downloaded through Firefox, can't locate them on the hard drive in the File Manager or any other Ubuntu Touch apps.\nIs there a way to save these files in the folders accessible under /Phablet/?\n\nA: I just saved a test document in LibreOffice to take a look at this. I tried to save it in phablet but via FileManager I found it in /home/phablet/.local/share/libertine-container/user-data/puritine\nI guess I can see the logic of that for security but it isn't great for users in cases like this.\nI can't see an easy way to break out of the libertine jail and save wherever you want- which I guess is a feature more than a bug. \nThe best thing might be to try mount --bind. It's a way to mount one folder as another. I am not so familiar with it, but it is described as a solution to a similiar problem here.\nOne thing to be careful of, the accepted answer to this question says that if you do mount chroot directories \". You will need to take extra care when doing so, if you wish to delete the chroot from your phone, or perform other destructive actions\".\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Instead of mounting /home/phablet/.local/share/libertine-container/user-data/puritine somewhere in home you can also create a softlink to that directory in /home/phablet/Documents\ncd ~/Documents;ln -s /home/phablet/.local/share/libertine-container/user-data/puritine Puritinedocs should do the trick.\nEdit: Just checked, this works and file permissions are fine. As a bonus the softlinks will survive reboots.\n\nA: You XDG documents folders are automatically bind-mounted into the Libertine container.  In other words, if you save a LibreOffice document in your Documents folder, it's saved to /home/phablet/Documents.\nThe XDG documents folders include Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 software center not working Just installed the UBUNTU 16.04 LTS. I just noticed that the software center is not working. I did installed the older version of it (sudo apt-get install software-center) but I want the new software center.\nHow can I install the new version of the software center?\n\nA: Type the following in the terminal in order to update gnome-software, which should fix the problem:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade gnome-software\n\nYou can also update using the graphical update manager, which will do the same thing.\n(The version of gnome-software shipped with Ubuntu had a bug which meant that it sometimes wouldn't start, which was fixed in a update)\n\nA: I had the same issue. I looked on the dashboard and had two Ubuntu Software programs installed. Deleted the old one (Ubuntu Software Center). That fixed my problem.\n\nA: This issue appeared on clean installation of 16.04, was fixed, and re-appeared. While it is difficult to replicate the issue and to analyze conditions, there was a fortunate remedy.\nUsing Synaptic Package Manager, go to Menu > Edit > Fix Broken Packages, mark identified packages for fix and upgrade, and let it apply.\nThen restart the computer.\n", "Q: Which IDE or Tool can I use to code ASP.NET applications on Ubuntu 15.10? I want to code in ASP.NET but I don't know which IDE to use\n\nA: Well, you can always use Visual Studio Code, it is neat and you can download many things for it.\nFor more info look here and to you can Download deb package from here.\n", "Q: What is devmode for snaps? I have heard about the ability to use snaps in developer mode.\nWhat is this mode and what can I use it for?\n\nA: Developer mode, or devmode in short, enables developers and users to install snaps without enforcing security policies. E.g.\nsudo snap install notes --devmode\n\nWhen installed this way, snaps behave in a similar way to traditional .deb packages in terms of accessing system resources. That is, snaps have access to the system without being restricted by app isolation and interfaces.\nDeveloper mode is useful when:\n\n\n*\n\n*Testing a snap in the first stages of development to ensure it runs as expected\n\n*Temporarily bypassing security enforcement if there is not yet an interface available that controls a particular system access required by the snap\n\n\nAs a developer, you can also relax security requirements at the snapcraft.yaml level by declaring devmode confinement instead of strict\nconfinement: devmode\n\nYou'll be then flagging users that this app specifically needs to be installed with --devmode to work. Not specifying the switch will result in failure to install.\nThat is, users will have to specifically acknowledge that they will install your snap in developer mode.\n", "Q: Bluetooth used to be enabled, now disabled and won't enable.

Ubuntu is pretty much broken, and everywhere I've looked doesn't have a solution, so I wish to uninstall it. I read that it's possible to uninstall Ubuntu by deleting its partition on Windows. I checked to see what partitions I have, and there are 7 unused partitions, and I'm not sure which one to delete. \n\nIs there any way to know which partition is Ubuntu so I don't delete the wrong one?\nCan I just delete Disk 0? Disk 1 is full of files that have names (like OEM, EFI, Recovery, etc).\n\nA: You can not delete Ubuntu partitions from Windows just because Win can't see Ubuntu (or any other linux) partitions. Like others already wrote, you need to boot into a Live linux (Live Ubuntu or any other), open GParted and notice an ext partition. That's where Ubuntu is. Also look for a swap partition. That's used by Ubuntu also. You can delete them both if you want Ubuntu gone. \nDO NOT delete EFI partition!! It is needed by any and all operating systems (including Win). EFI partition contains the GPT partition table records/data. If you  delete that you will render all installed operating systems inoperable.  \nRecovery partition is made by Windows. It contains some Windows critical data backup. When Win fails to boot, Win will use backup data from Recovery partition to repair itself. Some people delete that partition (since Win rarely manage to repair anything). I recommend keeping it, it's not very big or anything in the way.  \nOEM partition is, obviously, made by the hardware producer. It may contain proprietary drivers or rescue software. Not absolutely necessary since you can always find that software on the internet. \nUsually, the Windows partition is the active partition. Disk 0 seems like an external thumb drive (judging by size). I see no reason to keep that as active partition, unless planning to install Ubuntu from it.  \nJust remember that, after you delete Ubuntu, the Ubuntu's bootloader (GRUB) may still be present on your hard drive and you will have to use the Windows install disk to repair the Windows bootloader.\n\nA: from that pic it looks like your windows 8 partitions are all NTFS so don't delete those. \nAny of the partitions that don't say a type will be unused by windows so they would be most likely to be the right ones.\nThe only other explanations would be having other OS'es or if you have been changing the partition type labels.\n\nA: Boot using a ubuntu live usb and delete the partition using G Parted partition editor.It clearly shows your ubuntu os labelled.Then change the boot order woth Windows boot manager on top\n", "Q: How do I debug snaps? I've successfully built a snap that I can install on my system.\nHowever, it crashes upon start, and I'm not quite sure where to start debugging that crash.\nWhat are the different approaches to debugging an installed app failing to start?\n\nA: For debugging confined snaps (ie, installed without --devmode) there is a snap in the store called snappy-debug that will get better over time but is already useful. To use:\n    sudo snap install snappy-debug --devmode # after snapd 2.0.7 lands, drop --devmode\n    sudo snap connect snappy-debug:log-observe ubuntu-core:log-observe\n    sudo /snap/bin/snappy-debug.security scanlog\n\nThis scanlog command will tail the syslog, resolving seccomp syscall numbers and make suggestions on what interfaces to use, changes to make to your snap to work within the sandbox, etc. You can filter by snap with:\n    sudo /snap/bin/snappy-debug.security scanlog <snapname>\n\nSome more tips are covered here: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy/build-apps/debug\nUsing snap try can be helpful too.\n", "Q: Low FPS after upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 recently just installed 16.04, from 14.04 - did a fresh install - erased Hard drive. Everything went fine except now I get a drop of FPS from playing games, specially on steam.

Ubuntu 16.04 on my Dell E6520 laptop boots normally when plugged in.  However, when booting on battery power it shuts down entirely.  Sometimes it makes it as far as the Ubuntu loading screen, but then stops and the laptop shuts off entirely.\nI tried searching and found this results for a Lenovo Y560, though I'm not really knowledgeable about kernels so I'm not sure if a similar fix would be relevant for a Dell.\nWhat can I do to boot while on battery power?

There are currently three devices connected to a switch. One configured at 1.51, one at 1.20, and this 16.04 system I'm trying to configure for 1.49. Both 51 and 20 are communicating fine. I've switched out cables and tried different ports... so I know it's not a physical issue. And, in fact, one of the other systems on this switch is an Ubuntu 14.04 with an interface setup identically, but the IP is 51. The only problem here appears to be the Ubuntu 16.04 system.\n16.04 /etc/network/interfaces file:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# Primary network interface\nauto enp4s0\n#iface enp4s0 inet dhcp\niface enp4s0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.49\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\n$ ifconfig\nenp4s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f4:8e:38:e7:39:31  \n      inet addr:192.168.1.49  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n      inet6 addr: fe80::f68e:38ff:fee7:3931/64 Scope:Link\n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:258 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:2123 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n      RX bytes:28821 (28.8 KB)  TX bytes:208448 (208.4 KB)\n\nEverything looks fine.

I think this change can be reached by Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts > + but I am not sure how it could be done with gnome. \n\nHow can you change capslock to Ctrl by gnome-settings?\n\nA: Add 'caps:ctrl_modifier' to the value of org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options in gsettings, for example\n gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['compose:ralt', 'caps:ctrl_modifier']\"\n\nYou can use \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options | sed \"s/]/, 'caps:ctrl_modifier']/\")\"\n\nto append on to the current value of xkb-options.

You need to substitute the parents so that e.g. us(dvorak) becomes us+dvorak.\nThe XKB settings from gsettings are loaded by GNOME at startup and overwrite any previous settings. To use setxkbmap you need to make sure that your setxkbmap are run after the GNOME settings are applied.

Apache would be needed to be run as \"root\" and Apache has a built-in security check on it. Error notice you will see...\n\nApache has not been designed to serve pages while running as root. There are known race conditions that will allow any local user to read any file on the system. If you still desire to serve pages as root then add -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE to the CFLAGS env variable and then rebuild the server.

When I connect to the network at work using Kubuntu 16.04 it takes a few minutes to reach a destination (if it reaches it at all).  I don't have this problem at other places (home, the hotel etc.).  Others at work are using Windows and Mac and have normal speeds on the network.  I also get normal speeds when I connect via my Android phone.  But my 16.04 laptop has slow networking only when using the network at work.  How can I diagnose this issue and is it possible the problem is with the network at work itself?\n\nA: I can't comment, so I guess I'll \"answer\" :P\nThe first step, I'd say, would be to compare the terminal output of \"ipconfig /all\" on a Windows laptop (or \"ifconfig\" on a Mac, although it's very cluttered from what I recall) compared to that of \"ifconfig\" on your Kubuntu 16.04 laptop. \nYou can also get some verbose information from your Android phone by 'becoming a developer' (ie. going into Settings -> \"About phone\" and tapping on \"Build number\" a bunch of times) and then, in the Developer Options, enabling Wi-Fi Verbose Debugging. This'll make the Wi-Fi section in Settings much more verbose. Alternatively, you can open the dialer and run \"##4636##\" (this may not work on all devices, but it does if they're close to stock, ex. Nexus devices) which brings up the hidden Testing menu which includes \"Wi-Fi information\" -> \"Wi-Fi Status\" and should at least tell you the RSSI.\nCombine that with the \"iwconfig\" command on you Kubuntu laptop and you should have enough information to start comparing some things and seeing if there's some obvious difference between the connection your Kubuntu laptop is making and what others are.\nAs to what's going on, my initial guesses would be that either the Kubuntu laptop isn't getting the right gateway for some reason, or that it's not negotiating a decent frequency and thus the RSSI is bad or the TX rate is being severely limited. Those are just spurious guesses, however; more information is definitely needed, including very much as per the comments folks have already made (which again, I would've joined in on, but for some weird reason Stack Exchange makes the lower-tier methods of textual interaction the ones hardest to get the 'points' to be able to do!).\n", "Q: Display is on 42\" TV I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \n\n\n*\n\n*On Intel® Desktop Board DH55TC \n\n*With Intel® Core™ i3 CPU 540 @ 3.07GHz\n\n*500 GB SATA hard drive\n\n*Connected to 42\" LG TV with HDMI cable\n\n*TP-Link 300 MB USB wireless LAN\n\n*Wireless keyboard & mouse\n\n\nAll drivers are installed properly, display is also nice looking as per the TV.

Not even GRUB menu shows up.\nThe system actually boots all the way and I can ping it.  But can't do anything else (no ssh server installed at the moment).\nThe system is set to BIOS mode not UEFI.\nAnyone have any ideas what's going on?  The installation UI had no problems driving the monitor.\n\nA: First, try Ctl+Alt+F1, it should open a command line interface. (If that doesn't work try F2 or F3 instead of F1)\nThen try running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nAfter that, run sudo reboot, and hopefully it will be working.

To make things easier for newbies Ubuntu by default considers that all operations are done in Graphical User Interface and not Command Line Interface. However if someone still uses terminal to manually update then the notification comes without any real update present. Just click OK to update and you will most probably see that the pop up menu straightaway says that your computer is up to date instead of showing the update progress bar.\n", "Q: ThinkPad T430 Linux Forgive me if this is a question that has been asked many times before.

So, launch terminal go to Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Command and uncheck the option saying Run a custom command instead of my shell.\n\nA: Type in a Terminal window: sudo su, hit Enter and then type nautilus. In the Nautilus window right-click and choose Open Terminal here.  \nWhat sudo su did was to switch from current user to root user (superuser/admin). It means that your current user doesn't have enough privileges to do that action (Open Terminal here).

Asterisk 13.1.0 is available in the repos for Xenial. \nBut I'm supporting an application that needs Asterisk 1.8 LTS, because we use a custom plugin. We need to keep using Asterisk 1.8 and building it from source until we can port our plugin forward to the newer version of Asterisk. \nHowever, it seems like Asterisk 1.8 cannot be built with the version of g++ available on Xenial, which is 5.3.1. I get a ton of warnings, which can be silenced, but also a lot of fatal errors about duplicate-defined symbols, and possibly other fatal errors even if I could resolve these.\nExample:\niax2-parser.o: In function `ast_atomic_fetchadd_int':\nasterisk-1.8/include/asterisk/lock.h:600: multiple definition of `ast_atomic_fetchadd_int'\nchan_iax2.o:asterisk-1.8/include/asterisk/lock.h:600: first defined here\niax2-parser.o: In function `ast_atomic_dec_and_test':\nasterisk-1.8/include/asterisk/lock.h:646: multiple definition of `ast_atomic_dec_and_test'\nchan_iax2.o:asterisk-1.8/include/asterisk/lock.h:646: first defined here\n...etc...\n\nI've been reading other posts from people struggling with this, and I've been trying to use compiler options to work around it with no success.\nMy question is whether there is any solution to do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build Asterisk 1.8 using g++ 5.3.1 and resolve the compile errors.\n\n*Install an old version of g++ on Xenial (for example I know g++ 4.4.7 works to compile Asterisk 1.8 on our old OS).\n\n*Some other solution to build a version of Asterisk that will run on Xenial. Perhaps build on Ubuntu 14.04 and tar up the binaries? I'd expect to get library version conflicts.\n\n\nSome people will be glib and say, \"you should really just upgrade to Asterisk 13.1.0.\" Yes, I know of course that would be a better plan. I know Asterisk 1.8 has passed its EOL. Getting a resource to port our plugin forward to Asterisk 13.1.0 is what is holding us back.\n\nA: Based on the lead from @steeldriver, I learned that Ubuntu 16.04 has a package in its standard repo for gcc-4.8 and g++-4.8. I installed g++ and a few other packages needed for building Asterisk 1.8: \napt-get install g++-4.8 libcurl4-openssl-dev libncurses5-dev libxml2-dev\n\nThis installs g++4.8 as a distinct binary from g++ version 5.3.1, which is also installed. I just need to configure the Asterisk build to use g++4.8, and build:\n./configure CXX=g++4.8\nmake -j4\nmake install\n\nAnd eureka! It worked! I built this outdated version of Asterisk 1.8 on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: As Bill Karwin answered, it's a gcc issue. But I've managed to build Asterisk 1.8 only after adding an extra flag to configure:\n./configure CXX=g++-4.8 CC=gcc-4.8\n\nAlso note hyphens in the values.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04:\nsudo apt install g++-4.8\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 1`  \nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 1`  \n\nFor tcptls:  \nsudo apt install libssl1.0-dev`\n\n./configure \nmake menuselect\nmake\n\n\nA: I found out this is caused by inline issue.\nIn include/asterisk/inline_api.h  line #49:\ndefine AST_INLINE_API(hdr, body) hdr; extern inline hdr body\nchange this to:\ndefine AST_INLINE_API(hdr, body) hdr;\nThen make will passed.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 16.04 Server from USB drive?

See, if you start you computer and access the BIOs you might see an option to change between Legacy Support and UEFI mode, these are kind of BIOs. What happend in my case is that i had windows in UEFI and Ubuntu on Legact, and since i had my bios as legacy it booted ubuntu by default and was impossible to access windows. You should try to reboot your computer and open the OS select screen (in some PCs is done by holding down ESC, others with F2 and others with F9, it changes) and see if you can choose windows (with your C: and D: drives installed).\nIf that is not the case you might need to update your Grub, but i cant know for sure, can you post some pictures of you boot up procces?\nBTW, this should be posted as a comment, but i dont have enough reputation yet, so, yeah.\n\nA: OOPS!

I am trying to dual-boot El Capitan with Ubuntu MATE purely with my MacBookPro's EFI firmware and without using rEFInd or rEFIt. http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/How_to_Dual-Boot_OSX_and_Ubuntu.pdf shows how to do this without erasing and reinstalling OS X. I was following it when I ran into a problem with creating the Ubuntu Boot partition -- Disk Utility would not make it smaller than 5 GB. I am not wasting 5 GB just for a boot loader. So I googled it, and found this StackExchange question (link removed) that even referenced the guide I was using. In the command line, diskutil would not shrink the partition to be small enough. So then I saw the last comment on the only answer to that question, which says that booting from a true ESP is a better option. So now I've been thinking about how I will boot Ubuntu using Mac's firmware. I have roughly thought about three different methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the bootloader on the ESP already on the Mac. I would probably use ubiquity -b in the terminal and then installing the bootloader with a process similar to this one (link removed).\n\n*Doing the same thing as above, but creating a new ESP (not sure if this would even be necessary).\n\n*Not messing with an ESP and using bless to make the EFI file bootable on the same partition that Ubuntu is installed in. (Will there be an EFI file?)\n\n\nIf I seem like I don't exactly know what I'm doing it's because I don't, which is why I am here. Would any of these options work? Is there a better option to set this up?\nEDIT: Ok, I've installed Ubuntu MATE. I selected to install the boot loader on the ESP already on the Mac, and it went well. However, when I boot into the firmware, the only option that shows up is Macintosh HD. When I reboot from OS X, it will reboot to OS X. However, I can mount the ESP that I installed GRUB on and then bless it in the command line, and the Mac will reboot into Ubuntu MATE. My conclusion from this is that the firmware only allows the user to boot from a mounted volume, and I'm probably going to have to either mount my ESP in OS X or use a different partition for the boot loader (and mount that in OS X ).\nEDIT 2: Solved. I just copied the grubx64.efi file in the ESP to the directory /EFI/boot/bootx64.efi in the ESP (or any fat32/efi partition) and Apple's firmware detected it. Thanks to /u/5HT-2a.\n\nA: You don't have to use Disk Utility to make the partitions, since this is obviously the tool's limitation, why not use a different tool for partitioning such as a live CD? Arch and Ubuntu are not exactly the same when it comes to installing in UEFI. I recommend using the alternate medium to install ubuntu, select manual configuration and while installing you can set your boot partition for ubuntu to be mounted as 'boot', and the esp mounted as boot\\efi. Everything about ubuntu on the esp would be under an \"ubuntu\" folder. Once your setup and your installation is ready you should either add an option for chain-loading ubuntu on El Capitan (but can this happen? - i have no idea about osx) or use cloverefi which is the most widely used amongst hackintosh users as far as i know. https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/\n", "Q: Will r-base on ubuntu give me the same interface as RStudio with R on Windows?

If one video in the playlist can't be downloaded, it'll skip that video and continue on to the next, thanks to the -i flag.\nThere is no need to specify any command-line options to specify the quality.  The defaults are reasonable: the default is to download the highest-quality video and audio available, which probably makes sense in most cases.\nIf you don't like specifying flags on the command line, you can put them in youtube-dl's configuration file (e.g., ~/.config/youtube-dl/config).\nIt's amazing what you can find when you read the manual page!\n\nA: You can try Youtube Multi downloader.

So I had turn off the tablet 1 minute lock, move the files over and then set the 1 minute lock again.\nIs there a setting that I can activate to allow save the tablet lock activating while I am adding files/songs to my tablet?\nOn the whole, a really smooth process for adding music to my tablet.\n\nA: You might want to try Active Screen app by Michal Predotka as a workaround.\n", "Q: 16.04 Installer Crash and “No Bootable Device” with Acer R11 The trouble in Installer Crash and \"No Bootable Device\" with Acer R11 is nearly identical except for the version and the fact that it has no cd drive - must use USB install. I can \"try ubuntu\" (doing so now) but after installing the system won't boot, saying \"No bootable device\". I tried following Trashman's answer there: \"will work from USB if you add the acpi=off option to the boot command, both before and after the -- delimiter. . .\" but when I get into grub I cannot find any line as described to edit. \nI'm stuck here since I ran the install immediately on a brand new computer (arrived today) to replace Windows 10 (with no way to back up the OS before wiping it). I would have simply continued the discussion in the 14.04 thread I referred to but lack sufficient reputation to comment (due to spam answer problems there).\n\nA: Digging through here for things to try I eventually followed leads to How to install the Boot-Repair tool in an Ubuntu live disc?. This took care of it.

It's like having a C, D and E drive on Windows or having a /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 on Linux). Each one is about 15-20 GB. \nI installed Lubuntu by booting it off of my usb and installing it. However, now when I want to install something, it tells me I'm running out of space. \nThe first drive and the third drive look like they are filled with stuff from Windows installed of my computer. The second drive is completely empty. \nHow can I find out which drive the software is being installed on? Deleting things from any of the 3 drives doesn't seem to have an affect on the \"remaining space\" when it gives me the not enough space error message. The only thing that frees up space is when I uninstall something. \n\nA: You can use a tool like Baobab to monitor the Disc Usage. This will show you which Files take up the most space on your system. Deleting files on your Windows drive won't free up space for your ubuntu installation because per default Windows can't read the lubuntu filesystem.\nDid you use any custom partition at the installation of leave everything at default?\nBaobab | Disk Usage Analyzer\n", "Q: Is GNOME used in Ubuntu?

Because of this, files critical to Linux suddenly disappeared, causing your computer to freeze. All your files are still there, but since the drive that / was pointing to suddenly changed, Linux couldn't find them anymore.\n", "Q: ubuntu networking wired connection I tried to connect internet in ubuntu server with a wired connection.

Not the most elegant solution, but works for me.\n\nA: I am also currently going through the same problem.\nFrom what I gather, Ubuntu now recognizes the USB tether to be a \"mobile broadband\" connection, so it stops the wired connection and converts it to a \"mobile broadband\" one, and from that point configures it to match your configurations.\nThe only issue is that mobile broadband doesn't work.  I've been trying to find any documentation to stop/delete/remove this feature/function of what they call mobile broadband and keep it working the way it used to.\n", "Q: How to install Eclipse Neon/Mars for C/C++ on ubuntu 14.04 I have downloaded the related Eclipse .tar package from here to install on my 64 bit machine.

I'm playing Euro trucks and it needs windows 7. However, Wine hasn't windows 7 version and the game has many bugs. I can't play that game very well. how can I do it?\n\nA: Yes. Sometimes...\nYou can check the AppDB to see if your program is supported - for example, Euro Truck Simulator is rated Platinum (works great), while version 2 is rated Gold (may need some fixes).\nAlso, in Wine Configuration it is possible to select which Windows version to act as:\n\nBut I think this does not make that much difference unless a program checks specifically for which Windows version it wants, or if it requires something only available on that version.\nWine can implement DirectX if needed (Version 9 works, 10+ have more limited support). If you don't have it you can use Winetricks to install it (look for d3dx9 after running winetricks dlls - d3dx9_?? describes certain modules that may be needed). If you are using 64bit wine you will probably need to create a 32bit wineprefix first.\nThe game(s) require at least the following (source [v1] [v2]):\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU:                Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz\n\n*RAM:                4 GB RAM\n\n*GPU:                GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000)\n\n*DirectX:            DirectX 9.0c\n\n*OS:                 Windows 7\n\n*Storage:            2.0 GB free hard disk space\n\n*ODD:                DVD-ROM drive\n\n\nWhich I think your system with Wine can easily provide.\n\nA: Keep your Wine updated. CrossOver might also have some bug fixes (CrossOver is the paid version and usally get update before wine).\nWine also depends on how well your system is set up, Illegal versions of games might also be crippled, but gold editions are usually late version of games that also hold bug fixes.\nI couldn't play Age of Mythology (Original paid version) before I changed to an (illegal I guess) gold version, but I had to fix 3D in the system (old Nvidia legacy laptop card had some hickups but is blazing fast now for what it is. Keywords: vdpau,vaapi and glx).\nI still have some trouble with AoM using full screen Wine so the game must run windowed.\nYou can downgrade wine (if you update as I suggested) if trouble arises.

I got to an ASCII menu, chose to repair, and it came up with a graphic with five dots in a horizontal row which changed color to indicate activity.  However, after a while it got a kernel panic, with rtl8821ae_rx_query_desc appearing to be the kernel function the panic happened in.\n\nA: This is a known bug with older versions of the kernel, caused by the driver for the Realtek RTL8821AE WiFi card. Unfortunately, the ISO file which you can download from Sourceforge uses a kernel which is several years old and thus has this bug. Further, that version has no way to get access to the advanced options so as to avoid trying to use the network.\nThe solution is to download a live Linux distro onto your USB stick, boot into that, install boot-repair and invoke it from the command line (the more recent versions of the kernel the live distro use won't have the bug).

However, Patrik Jacobsen is working with it. \n\nA: I can't get gsettings to change the brightness on my laptop running Ubuntu 16.06, but I can change the brightness by storing a value in /sys/class/backlight/device-name/brightness where device-name is one of the video devices listed in /sys/class/backlight.  In each of these directories there is a max_brightness file. To write to these files you will need to be root.  So in my case, using the first of the 3 device directories (which in my case is acpi_video0),\n$ ls /sys/class/backlight    # shows the video devices\nacpi_video0    acpi_video1    radeon_bl0\n$ cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness   # shows current level\n7\n$ cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness   # shows max level\n10\n$ sudo sh   # become super-user\n# echo 3 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness   # dim screen\n# echo 10 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness   # max brightness\n# exit   # return to unprivileged user\n$ sudo sh -c \"echo 10 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\"\n\nThe final line above gives a \"one-liner\" brightness change command.\nYou could extend this if desired to compute a fraction of brightness required based on max_brightness using the expr command.\nP.S.

The system uses a pppoe link to a fibre-modem and runs web, email and DNS services with a shorewall configured firewall.\nDuring the update and until next rebooting, networking was working fine.  However, it has since consistently failed to route correctly to the Internet (although internal network routing is fine). Pinging the far end of the ppp link does work from the gateway, but external DNS lookups fail.\nRouting is configured using the interfaces file, which hasn't changed and looks very boring: one 'internal' network on 192.168.*.* and a ppp link using the second Ethernet interface on the machine. None of those configurations has changed. The ppp interface has the proper local IP address.\nI have checked sysctl.conf file and IP forwarding is enabled there. I haven't actually checked that it's set in the kernel.\nI may be able to add specific details later -- but I'm not on my home system (because Internet access is broken) so copy/paste isn't easy.\nSo: is anyone aware of changes in 16.04 that might have caused this, or at least be worthy of further investigation?\n\nA: Well, I have an answer of sorts, though I am not sure why.\nOriginally, my pppd setup included defaultroute, but I noticed in the Ubuntu PPPoE setup guide that the base setup included replacedefaultroute.\nI have added that to the pppd peers file, and reinstated other things as they were before, and now it works.\nFor anyone else in this situation: although the gateway networking worked straight away, I needed to do shorewall restart to resume internet access from the internal network.\n", "Q: Issue with ubuntu/linux boot and grub I have a windows box that I wanted to trial Ubuntu with. So using two usb sticks I used one stick as a Ubuntu installer and installed it onto the other stick.\nI changed the bois to boot from usb first, so when the usb stick is plugged in it boots into Ubuntu.\nThis is working great, infact the Ubuntu boot gives me the option to boot into windows or Ubuntu - which is an unexpected bonus.\nHowever, the problem is when I shutdown and reboot (or restart) the PC goes into some strange (to me) command line like this:\ngrub:\nI can power the PC down and then back up and it still goes into this grub CLI. The only way I have found to get around this is to boot into bois, do nothing (since the settings are correct) and then save+exit and then it boots into the Ubuntu boot-menu as normal.\nCan anyone explain what is going on and how to avoid this grub CLI?\nUpdate\nI have done some searching around and have found out (I think) what grub is.... it seems to be Ubuntu/Linux's boot program.\nSo I think I need to configure my \"grub\" to boot normally into Ubuntu every time (or maybe used last saved value)... maybe like in this question\nHowever for me my system boots directly onto the grub command line and does not provide the boot menu.... I am not sure what that means in terms of how to configure grub (see my earlier question for details there - the first link).\nSo I am still stuck, but I have a vague idea what I need to do, any pointers would be great.\nupdate-2\nI have tried the link haddy provided... it seemed to be going well, until I discovered that when I do ls I can only see one drive (the hdd and not the usb):\ngrub> ls\n(hd0) (hd0,gpt7) (hd0,gpt6) (hd0,gpt5) (hd0,gpt4) (hd0,gpt3) (hd0,gpt2)\n(hd0,gpt1)\n\nUnfortunatly I can't copy/paste.... but if I do ls (hd0 and tab it out I get:\ngrub> ls (hd0[tab]\npossible partitions are:\n\nDevice hd0: No known filesystem detected - Sector size 512Kb - total size 488386584KiB\n    Partition hd0,gpt1: Filesystem type fat - Label 'SYSTEM', UUID....\n    Partition hd0,gpt1: No known file system detected...\n            :\n    Partition hd0,gpt7: No known file system detected...\n\nSo it looks like grub is not seeing my USB drive... which is odd since it should be booting off that drive. If I go into BIOS and exit it (with no changes) then it boots fine... its strange.\nupdate-3\nok, so I realised that when I remove my usb stick it still boots into grub.... so this must mean it has been installed onto the windows HDD. So I have followed a list of instructions from here and I can always boot into ubuntu from grub, but the option to boot into windows has gone! :o\nnot sure what to do now :(\n\nA: \nHowever, the problem is when I shutdown and reboot (or restart) the PC goes into some strange (to me) command line like this:\ngrub:\n\n\nIf this happens when your Ubuntu USB key is disconnected, it means you overwrote the boot record of your Windows system with a different MBR which is looking for GRUB.\nYou should restore the boot record of your hard drive using the Windows installation disc (or recovery disc created through the Windows interface), while the USB key is not connected.

Because of the space limitations I do not want to use 32GB of the SSD for swap. My plan was to use something between 8 and 16GB of swap. (I have 16GB of RAM). What would you guys recommend?\n\nA: Swap should be on SSD or else it might slow down your system when it will be needed (used to happened to me when I was using virtualbox so I have reduced swappiness from 60 to 10 to solve this)\nIf you want to use hibernation then you will need at least 20GB as shown here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq.\nIf you don't use hibernation then with 16GB ram you should be ok with a small swap, so use around 4GB in order to get more space.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 and [AMD/ATI] Thames [Radeon HD 7550M/7570M/7650M] fan active most of the time My notebook has Ubuntu 16.04 installed.

I have my Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20 installation setup so that I get the verbose console output on startup (I upgraded from 15.10 where I already had it enabled). During the upgrade somewhere close to the end (I was in a TTY) I suddenly noticed that all the text had lost its normal bold and was just normal (without the bold), this does actually make it somewhat harder to read. And when my machine starts up for the first half of the output it is bold, but then suddenly it goes to this normal font.\nIs this meant to be the case or is this a bug? And whether it's meant to be the case or not, is there any way to change it back to always being bold (this is the case in all my TTYs)?\n\nA: You will notice this happening when the OS is able to set a font that it prefers, if you would like to keep the font as it is run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -p medium console-setup\n\nThen select the Do not change the boot/kernel font option from the list of options, unless of course another of the options there is more appealing for you, in which case you may choose one of them to decide which font it changes it to. Otherwise choosing the option I have mentioned will mean that the font at the beginning (in this case the bold font) will be the font always used in the console and it will not change to another. This is the font set in the BIOS.\n", "Q: strange command prompt error Whenever I have two command prompts open I always get this script coming up after I execute the commands. \nJust to clarify the

How this issue could probably solved ?\n\nA: Ok,well, the problem is that default MTU value is problematic at some networks (MTU is set to automatic which means 1500 for wifi). I had similar problems (with hotmail.com) so I solved them by changing MTU at value 1480. @Xingdong solved his by changing MTU to 1460 (as discussed at comments).\nEasiest way to change MTU value is clicking on wifi icon and select Edit Connections. Then select your wifi connection and click Edit. Under Wi-Fi tab change MTU from automatic to a value that works for you (search web for some usually used MTU values depending on your internet connection). Then disable and re enable wifi for change to take effect. MTU must be 1500 or lower for wifi and ethernet and as close to 1500 as possible. The only method that worked for me in order to find correct MTU value is to start from 1498 and decreasing by 2 each time until the desired sites work.\n", "Q: Issues with Nvidia graphics driver and CUDA after apt-get upgrade I previously installed CUDA 7.5 on Ubuntu 14.04 using the \"deb (network)\" install from Nvidia. It has worked for a few months, until I ran sudo apt-get upgrade today. After doing this, I encountered the following\n$ nvidia-smi\nmodprobe: ERROR: ../libkmod/libkmod-module.c:809 kmod_module_insert_module() could not find module by name='nvidia_352'\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia_352': Function not implemented\nNVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.\n\nRunning sudo nvidia-smi is no different.\nI am unable to login in GUI mode (it just goes back to the login screen after I enter my password), but I can access the terminal.\nI have been able to restore graphical functionality, however I am having difficulty re-installing CUDA after that. Can you please help me?\nRestoring graphics\nI have found that I can get the graphics to work again by doing\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nand then editing /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list to remove all lines, then doing\n$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nand rebooting the system. After this, nvidia-smi is working again. However, I still need to re-install CUDA.\nTrying to re-install CUDA\nI tried restoring the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list and then doing sudo apt-get install cuda.\nI noticed this error message:\nLoading new nvidia-352-352.93 DKMS files...\nBuilding only for 3.13.0-68-generic\nBuilding for architecture x86_64\nBuilding initial module for 3.13.0-68-generic\nERROR: Cannot create report: [Errno 17] File exists: '/var/crash/nvidia-352.0.crash'\nError!

So I have an HP EliteBook that is using UEFI instead of BIOS, which I was not aware of before. This is my first encounter with UEFI.\nThis laptop already had Windows 10 installed, and I wanted to dual boot a linux distribution to access some software that is not available in Windows. I downloaded Linux Mint 17.3 because I wanted to try something different than the standard Ubuntu install. Made a live USB from www.pendrivelinux.com Yumi tool, and proceeded to install Linux Mint.\nInstallation went through no problem, but then I couldn't boot the computer without USB stick. I can use the USB stick and \"start from first hard drive\", but without USB stick it says there is no hard drive present or something similar. With the USB stick I tried to mount Windows partition, but it can't because it says Windows is in suspended mode or something such. I read about how you have to turn off something in Windows 10 before you try to dual-boot, but it's too late to change that now, damage is already done. I would prefer to keep my windows disk if at all  possible, but I don't mind wiping the linux stuff and starting over.\nSo I tried downloading the Windows 10 iso from microsoft.com and dd that to a USB stick with the Linux live CD. Doesn't work, I can't get it to boot from any other USB stick than the Live CD I first created from Windows with Yumi, no matter how hard I try. Then I tried making a partition on the hard drive with the Windows 10 installation medium, but that only shows a screen that \"installation medium is missing\" when I manage to boot into it with syslinux from the Yumi USB stick. So it seems I can't use Windows installation disk to reset the system, because this laptop doesn't have a CD drive.\nAfter reading a lot about UEFI and EFI installations of Linux, I thought maybe I can get it to work with a new installation of a different distribution. So I tried Xubuntu and Ubuntu standard desktop. Both of them install fine, but refuse to boot after some error that I don't remember. So finally I downloaded the Gentoo LiveDVD but that doesn't even start the LiveDVD because it hangs on something like Windows is sleeping please fix your hard drive (like Mint and Ubuntu should have done, if they had then I would have been a lot more aware of the problems facing me). Anyway, nothing I tried installing will fix the issue. All installation mediums I tried just installs some version of GRUB and I have to use the Live USB Yumi stick to select \"start from first hard drive\" in order to get to the GRUB menu. And even then, they don't include Windows 10 in the GRUB menu, and they don't start themselves. \nLinux Mind 17.3 that I installed first is still intact and can be started through the USB stick. And I can get most live distributions to run through the syslinux Yumi USB stick. Gentoo is the only one that completely refuse to start, with reference to Windows sleeping. \nProcessing triggers for man-db (2.6.7.1-1ubuntu1) ...\nSetting up refind (0.10.3-0ppa1) ...\nInstalling rEFInd to the ESP...\nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry 'modprobe efivars' as root.\n\nI also tried to install rEFInd because I saw some discussion that it might help, but I get the above error and running modprobe efivars doesn't appear to do anything at all.\nThe linux installs all try to use GRUB. None of the distributions I tried so far have identified the need to use EFI. \nSo my question is, how can I revert back to before I tried to install any linux distro? How can I let my machine just step back to use EFI again instead of GRUB through USB-stick? Like I said, booting from a different USB doesn't work for whatever reason, so I can't use the rescue files. \nCan I edit the EFI partition manually? I tried mounting it, and it's just some files, looks like a normal partition. But I can't find any guide for this through my googling so far...\n$ sudo blkid \n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Windows RE Tools\" UUID=\"EE9AA08D9AA0543D\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"SYSTEM\" UUID=\"3EA1-5B19\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda4: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"FE120EA9120E674D\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"86F6385CF6384EA5\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"ee115c6d-6d07-415f-92af-56ddf14f99f3\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"f01d733f-f665-485e-afa5-254ecfecc6ec\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda9: UUID=\"00acda3f-fcfe-408d-a6c6-d692e85d3ea7\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda10: LABEL=\"Windows10install\" UUID=\"019A3789077F6B20\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"MULTIBOOT\" UUID=\"3696-FEFE\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sdc1: LABEL=\"UDF Volume\" TYPE=\"udf\" \n\n$ sudo parted\nGNU Parted 2.3\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted!

It doesn't create any problems.\n\n\nA: It's a very long ... question. I will try to clarify just some parts of it.  \n\n\n*\n\n*...using UEFI instead of BIOS is an inaccurate statement. As far as i know, a motherboard can have either a UEFI or BIOS, not both. There have been some early hybrids (UEFI+BIOS) motherboards, but they were rapidly abandoned because of multiple problems. If your HP was UEFI, it will forever be UEFI, not BIOS. UEFI is an evolution of BIOS.\nUEFI = Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\nBIOS = Basic Input Output System  \n\n*The linux installs all try to use GRUB. This statement is accurate. GRUB = GRand Unified (linux) Bootloader. All linuxes use GRUB. Windows uses a bootloader too. It's called winboot (for W7+) or ntldr (for WinXP).\nNo operating system can startup without a proper bootloader. The bootloader is like the middleman between the hardware and the operating system.\n\n*None of the distributions ... need to use EFI. But they all do. On all EFI hardware systems, ALL installed operating systems NEED to use a special partition called the EFI partition. The EFI partition is the keeper of partition table data/records. If you delete the EFI partition ALL installed operating systems will be rendered inoperable.  \n\n*No need to edit the EFI partition really. But you can edit the partition table (add, delete, merge, resize partitions) by using GParted or other partitioning software.  \n\n*What the he*l is this partition table? Partition table keeps the records about all disk devices (hard drives, USB mass storage, external hdd, sd cards, all storage devices in general), like how many partitions, what size, type, label, order, etc.\nPartition table can be of two types: MBR (older style) or GPT (newer style).\nMBR = Master Boot Record\nGPT = GUID Partition Table (GUID = Globally Unique Identifier)\nTypically MBR style is traditionally associated with BIOS motherboards, but it can be used on UEFI mbs also.\nGPT style can only be used on UEFI systems, it is not supported by BIOS mbs.\nMBR partition table is always kept on the first partition.\nGPT partition table is always kept on the EFI partition, AND it also has a backup at the end of the disk.\nWhen MBR gets corrupted, they are usually gone for good. That means you have to reinstall EVERYTHING.\nWhen GPT gets corrupted, the PC will automatically load the backup and replace the corrupted.  \n\n*Getting back to Win10. Boot up a Live Ubuntu and open GParted. Delete all ext and swap partitions. Make sure you don't delete FAT and ntfs partitions, Windows might need those. Reboot and remove Live Ubuntu medium. Next GRUB menu might appear or some window telling you Windows is broken. In either case you need to repair Win bootloader. Insert Windows install disk, reboot into Win installer, choose Repair Windows option and let it do its' thing. When repair is complete reboot into your repaired Windows.\n", "Q: How do I get the latest Java JRE version? I have Ubuntu 14.04 and I need the latest version of Java JRE to run certain games but I have the old version and I do not know how I can update it.

To select entire words in my old laptop I used triple click (which emulates two real mouse clicks) and I used to move my cursor from the selected word to other words and the selection expanded word by word until I released the touchpad. In my new notebook, if I use triple click it will select a word but if I don't apply enough pressure after that it will release the selection and I can't select next words. All other gestures (include simple selection which activates by double click) work fine and I think the problem is in configuration.\nsynclient has so many configuration variables which makes me frustrated.

If someone needs tips for clean install of ubuntu touch, you can contact me.\nEdit: Only thing what is solved is how to reinstall os. Still have issues with carrier in Finland.\nI bought Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition about month ago from jd.com. Device was shipped with OTA-10.2 and everything was working fine. Some little problems first when i was calling and my number wasn't showing. I got that fixed by disabling \"private number\" from my carrier services. \nNow the problem is that when i upgraded to OTA-11, i'm losing 2G/3G connecting randomly and quite often. Signal indicator shows most of the time at least half signal both 2G and 3G, but i cannot receive calls. And when i realize that i cannot receive calls and try to call someone, signal just drops down and i cannot make a call. Sometimes this gets fixed for sometime when i just reboot, but not every time. \nI have been checking 2G/3G data connections and realized that also data connections does that. - When i choose data connection \"only 2G\" or \"2G/3G\" and start using it, signal drops down or data transfer speeds are incredible slow. Looks like 4G is working fine.\nAt the same time when I upgraded to OTA-11, i installed Unity tweak tool from Openstore to try out what i can do with that. So UT-tool can also be the cause of this problem. I have tried phones own \"recover\" multiple times, but i don't think that will wipe all the data. \nI guess the best solution is that somehow i have to wipe all the data, including system data from my device and reinstall the OS. I think i wanna try to get OTA-10.2 back and see if there is this kind of issues and then upgrade to OTA-11 and see how it works. \nDoes anyone know \"easy\" way to do this? I'm quite new with Linux systems...\nOr some other solution? \nSome other information: My carrier Sonera Finland.\nDone some Googling and i'm quite sure my device is \"international version\", unrooted, unlocked\nThanks already\n\nA: I have been experiencing the same issues as you with my mobile data on my bq Aquaris E5 (which is also running OTA-11). I have raised this before here, under the following question Ubuntu Touch - Mobile Data becoming increasingly unusable I have not decided to flush the phone as yet, but can understand your thought process behind doing that. For me, my wife is on the same network and if I have no signal, she always has one on her Samsung S5. I get better coverage on 2G. I have also found that if I turn the phone to flight mode and then back again, the mobile data works for a bit and then seems to time out. If I go on to a webpage and then refresh it, the Internet seems to come on, like it is sleeping without any activity. However, if this is the case certain things do not seem to wake it up like new Telegram messages and such like.\nNot possibly the answer you were looking for, but at least you know that you are not the only one with this issue. I will be raising this in Launchpad shortly.\n", "Q: Solution to viewing WMV files wants to remove packages. How can I solve this?

Pure bash:\nFILENAME=\"${1%-*}\"\n\n% is used to remove the shortest matching suffix. If you have file-name-foo, you'll get file-name. To remove the longest matching suffix, use %%.\nTo save to $1, you'll have to use set. Something like:\nset -- \"${1%-*}\" \"${@:2}\"\n\nThen the next time you use $1, it will have the trimmed text.\nRemember, no spaces around = when assigning variables.\n\nA: You can do it by\n#!/bin/bash\nFILENAME=$1\nTRIMMED=$(echo \"$FILENAME\" | cut -f1 -d-)\n\nThe command will output field 1 using - as a delimeter.\n\nA: Can be done like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n# trim text after '-' from user input 'file-name.txt'\nFILENAME=\"$(sed 's/-.*//' <<< $1).txt\"\n\n# save 'file' back to $1\nmv \"$1\" \"$FILENAME\"\n\nExplanation:\nIn my example I use the sed command to shorten the name which usually has this layout 'command/search/replacement/'. In my example above i use s as command which is search and replace, then -.* as search word (regex) which will search all combinations beginning with a - then followed by a random character . and telling it this keeps on till the end with *. The replacement string I leave empty, this means file-name.txt becomes file.\nThe <<< is bash specific and is called a here-string, so this wont work in sh.

It's great for remaining secure.\nWhen it works, anyways. I seem to have a bit of an issue with Enigmail in which I can click on an encrypted email, but the email simply shows a blank page and no error message is thrown. I can't tell what is broken, and no FAQs are really being helpful, either. I've tried a reinstall of gpg and gpg2, but that doesn't help either.\nUbuntu v16.04, Thunderbird v38.8.0, Enigmail v1.9.3\n\nA: How I solved this:\nEssentially, the only sane way I could find of fixing this was to completely reinstall the OS. I was able to do an export of my previous enigmail settings (including the key) and subsequently import it to a different client. I moved from Ubuntu 16.04 to Kubuntu 16.04, so there should be little difference behind-the-scenes, there. \nEither way, that's it. If you're having a similar issue and don't want a reinstall, try making a new question. Sorry for not providing a cleaner solution.\n\nA: An old question, but Enigmail still fails silently on occasion. Three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*A non-obvious problem with gpg. Try running gpg -k on the command line. If it hangs, you may have a poisoned key in your pubring.gpg. See here for an explanation and a one-liner to detect the poisoned key (requires gpg 2 or later). You may also find it quicker simpler to replace pubring.gpg from a backup. Sometimes there may be one in the same directory.\n\n*Some problem with gpg-agent and the pinentry method. See Resolving issues with GnuPG 2.x and gpg-agent on the Enigmail site.\n\n*Corrupt Enigmail storage. Close Thunderbird, and find which profile directory you are using. Within that there should be a file enigmail.sqlite. Move that to a backup location. Restart Thunderbird and try again.\n\n\nFor example, I had a situation when the Key Management dialogue did not appear, or on the second attempt it appeared and rapidly closed. The answer turned out to be case 1 above, with a 22M key from Torproject.org.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 16.04 set all drive IO schedulers to \"deadline\"? I just installed Xubuntu 16.04-64bit to a second partition on my laptop.  I noticed it seemed a bit slow at times, so I checked which IO scheduler it was using for that drive, which turns out to be deadline for all drives.  I do have a couple of SSDs and hard drives so I know that \"deadline\" is best for SSDs and cfq for hard drives.\nI booted into 14.04 on another partition and it is using cfq for the rotating drives and deadline for the SSD, as it should.  I, also, looked into /etc/udev/rules.d to see if 14.04 was using a rule to configure for the type of drive but it wasn't there, so I assume that the kernel is doing it.\nSo I'm wondering if this is a bug or are they using \"deadline\" for everything now?\nUpdate: The comment I wrote about /etc/udev/rules.d was a mistake.  In fact I have been using a udev rule to change the scheduler (just as the answer has below) according to rotation type since I started using an SSD, a few years back.  I guess I just forgot...getting old.  Anyway, one of the references I used was Debian SSD optimization wiki.\nWouldn't it be a good idea if it was included?  Just a suggestion!\n\nA: I don't know why the developers decided to choose deadline as default scheduler, maybe it is because most new computers ship with a SSD, on which normally the systems are installed. You can set the scheduler manually this way, in case you haven't already installed it ... install gksu :  \nOpen a terminal and execute :  \nsudo apt install gksu  \n\nThen execute this command :\ngksudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-schedulers.rules  \n\nPaste the following text into the empty file and save the changed file.\n# set cfq scheduler for rotating disks\nACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"sd[a-z]\", ATTR{queue/rotational}==\"1\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"cfq\"\n\n# set deadline scheduler for non-rotating disks\nACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"sd[a-z]\", ATTR{queue/rotational}==\"0\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"deadline\"  \n\nReboot the operating system and now you are using the optimal schedulers for HDDs and SSDs.\n\nA: With the release of 14.04 the default scheduler for the 3.13 kernel was changed from CFQ to Deadline.\nThere is no longer a separate server kernel and the CFQ sheduler is not suited to many server usage scenarios eg KVM write timeouts. \nThere are even performance regressions on the desktop with USB devices.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Kernel Team regularly run a lot of analysis of different simulated workloads on different file systems and I/O schedulers to get an idea of the best generic I/O scheduler choice.  The general answer is that there is no perfect I/O scheduler choice for a generic configuration across all the different types installs for all the different kinds of media.  The salient points to remember are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Systems are moving to SSD, so noop or deadline are best for these; noop has less CPU overhead than deadline.\n\n*CFQ vs Deadline is a hard call.  CFQ does allow greater flexibility. However, we found that for a wider range of simulated I/O operations, deadline provided lower latencies and slightly higher higher throughput than CFQ.\n\n*I benchmark kernels regularly (each kernel test takes 3+ days to complete) for a range of file systems and I/O schedulers.  From this, and other assorted data we try to make an informed decision on the best choice, see: \nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/fs-tests/\nThere are pros/cons to all I/O schedulers, so any default is not perfect and the Ubuntu kernel team is always willing to have input to the default choice if compelling data and reasons show us to change otherwise. \n", "Q: PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library I got error like\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php/20151012/php_intl.dll' - /usr/lib/php/20151012/php_intl.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php/20151012/php_soap.dll' - /usr/lib/php/20151012/php_soap.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\n\nAs @Parto said\nI run php -i | grep \".ini\"\nAnd got result :-\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php/20151012/php_intl.dll' - /usr/lib/php/20151012/php_intl.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php/20151012/php_soap.dll' - /usr/lib/php/20151012/php_soap.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0\nConfiguration File (php.ini) Path => /etc/php/7.0/cli\nLoaded Configuration File => /etc/php/7.0/cli/php.ini\nScan this dir for additional .ini files => /etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d\nAdditional .ini files parsed => /etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/10-mysqlnd.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/10-opcache.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/10-pdo.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/15-xml.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-bcmath.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-calendar.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-ctype.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-curl.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-dom.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-exif.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-fileinfo.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-ftp.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-gd.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-gettext.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-iconv.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-intl.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-json.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-mbstring.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-mcrypt.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-mysqli.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-pdo_mysql.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-phar.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-posix.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-readline.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-shmop.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-simplexml.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-soap.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-sockets.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-sysvmsg.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-sysvsem.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-sysvshm.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-tokenizer.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-wddx.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-xmlreader.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-xmlwriter.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-xsl.ini,\n/etc/php/7.0/cli/conf.d/20-zip.ini\nuser_ini.cache_ttl => 300 => 300\nuser_ini.filename => .user.ini => .user.ini\ncom_init_db => 0\nClasses => AppendIterator, ArrayIterator, ArrayObject, BadFunctionCallException, BadMethodCallException, CachingIterator, CallbackFilterIterator, DirectoryIterator, DomainException, EmptyIterator, FilesystemIterator, FilterIterator, GlobIterator, InfiniteIterator, InvalidArgumentException, IteratorIterator, LengthException, LimitIterator, LogicException, MultipleIterator, NoRewindIterator, OutOfBoundsException, OutOfRangeException, OverflowException, ParentIterator, RangeException, RecursiveArrayIterator, RecursiveCachingIterator, RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator, RecursiveDirectoryIterator, RecursiveFilterIterator, RecursiveIteratorIterator, RecursiveRegexIterator, RecursiveTreeIterator, RegexIterator, RuntimeException, SplDoublyLinkedList, SplFileInfo, SplFileObject, SplFixedArray, SplHeap, SplMinHeap, SplMaxHeap, SplObjectStorage, SplPriorityQueue, SplQueue, SplStack, SplTempFileObject, UnderflowException, UnexpectedValueException\n\nI am using php 7 and Ubuntu 16.04\n\nA: Run: \nsudo gedit -H /etc/php/7.0/cli/php.ini\n\nand comment out extension=php_intl.dll.\n\nA: Something wrong with your configuration, but if you have root access, just install again the missing extensions. For PHP 7.0:\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-intl\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-soap\n\nNote the version of your Ubuntu could be necessary in some weird cases (you upgraded too much your packages and need to downgrade).

You shoul not enable the extension in php.ini (e.g. you should not uncomment the line ;extension=php_mbstring.dll, for instance). \nYou should install the extension like sudo apt-get install php-mbstring and let it be automatically activated. \n\nA: Sometime some of extensions are not install \nso you can install it with terminal\nrun following commands to install that particular extensions \nsudo apt-get install php7.0-extension name \nor\nyou can install all extension with following command\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-*\n\nA: I tried with following commands and error gone : \nnano /etc/php/7.1/cli/php.ini\n\nSearch for intl.dll and soap.dll comment this extension\nservice apache2 restart\n\n\nA: First check from where the php.ini file is getting applied for your project.\nTo check this just save file with below code in root folder with name phpInfo.php\n<?php echo phpInfo(); ?>\n\nNow run the file on browser by typing http://localhost/file_folder/phpInfo.php and check for Loaded Configuration File. Now open the file in editor and uncomment(remove comma from start) php_intl\nDon't forget to restart apache.\n", "Q: sudo -s takes a long time to execute and prompts sudo: was not possible to resolve machine XXX I do not know what is wrong but now, whenever i use a sudo command it takes a long time to execute and prompts:\nsudo: was not possible to resolve machine XXX\n\nthen it executes. It seems that is searching for the machine name like a dns and the time it takes is a network timeout. Can anyone help me? Thank you.\n\nA: Maybe there is something wrong in your host file. You can read it by using.\ncat /etc/hosts\n\nEDIT: it has to match your /etc/hostname\n\nA: Looks like your linux bos is trying to resolve the hostname which is not setup in your hosts file. If you type the word hostname should print the actual host name setup. \nsudo nano /etc/hosts #opens the file for editing\n127.0.0.1 myhostname #add this to the file and Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit\n\nThat should sort you out but you can also trace the syscall to see where it's spending alot of time executing\nsudo strace -r -o trace.log sudo echo hello\n\nNB: With strace, each line starts with the time taken since entering the previous syscall.\nRegards Douglas\n", "Q: PHP not working after updating from 5 to 7 I updated PHP 5 to PHP 7, but I noticed the old version was still configured in my Apache server, so I uninstalled it.

For options on the adduser command see its man page.\nadduser --ingroup hos hos\n\nNow to the second part of that question, creating a file containing the names of files in /etc which begin with a.

As an example of such declaration:\napps:\n  tinyproxy:\n    command: ./launcher.sh\n    daemon: simple\n    plugs: [network,network-bind]\n\nHowever, what does it exactly mean to be a system service in a snap? That is, what's their lifecycle (start, restart, stop...)? Can I monitor them running in the system with the usual tools (ps, top, etc)?\n\nA: From https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/debug/\nTesting a service\nTo test a service it must be installed first. Once it is installed, systemd's systemctl command can be used to see if the service starts and runs as expected, for example:\nsystemctl status snap.<name>.<appname>\n\nFinding the logs\nThe journalctl command can be used to inspect the messages that the service sends to stdout/stderr, for example:\njournalctl -u snap.<name>.<appname>\n\nServices may log additional data to syslog (/var/log/syslog) or to custom log directories. Note that custom log directories must be in a path that the service can write to (usually SNAP_DATA).\nGetting a core dump\nTo enable core dumps you have to configure a place to write them to through sysfs. For instance you can use\n$ echo \"/tmp/core.%e.%p\" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n\nto ensure that your coredumps get written into the /tmp directory regardless of where CWD of the process that received a signal was.\n", "Q: How to fix GRUB I have Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot with Windows 8\nSo I decided I need to reinstall Ubuntu to increase its space. \nI went to Windows 8 and deleted the Ubuntu partitions and now I can't turn on my computer or anything and I keep getting  every time.\nMy highest priority is not to touch other partitions.\nI already have tried this:\nGNU GRUB Version 2.02 beta 2-9 while booting from USB\n\nA: Hi have you tried Supergrub 2 rescue?

I have an encrypted disk, and I get asked for a password before reaching the login prompt, then again to log in.\nAs I have only a single user account, the password to which is the same as my disk encryption password, the login prompt on startup offers no additional security, so I'd like to disable it and simply login automatically.\nI attempted to follow this guide, but when I go to User Accounts I don't see the \"Asked on Login\" option, so this menu has presumably changed since 13.04.\nHow can I set up Ubuntu so that I only get asked for a login once?\n\nA: The act of encrypting also implies you have to abide by the rules set for encrypting. One of those rules is: NO automatic login. Your password is required to unwrap the mount pass phrase used to decrypt your home.\nIf you want automatic login: remove the encryption.\n\nI don't see the \"Asked on Login\" option, so this menu has presumably changed since 13.04.\n\nNo, it is as intended: encryption does not allow automatic login.\n\n\nI have an encrypted disk, and I get asked for a password before reaching the login prompt, then again to log in.\n\nPassword is asked for every encrypted partition.

I have one GPG Personal key, two SSH RSA keys, and one Machine Owner Key. What would be the best way to keep them safe if I don't want to take them off my hard drive?\n\nA: Encrypt them (perhaps just use the standard utility to zip them up and use a password, or even several layers) and then place them somewhere where you know where they are but others would not, if you want to keep them really hidden then give them names that don't make them look out of the ordinary, you could also put a . infront of each in the filename to make them hidden on the Linux and Unix file systems.\nThough normally you will be asked to set a passphrase for them so they will have already been encrypted.\nI just store mine though in the GNOME Keyring, that keeps them reasonably well protected and encrypted. But then people do know where to find them, so it's your choice really.\n\nA: You may install keepassx.  That's exactly what it does.

I use the history / CtrlR thing quite a bit, but from time to time either \n\n\n*\n\n*a command I use regularly (but not regularly enough, apparently)\n\"fades out\" behind my command history threshold, or \n\n*some system hang-up caused me to hard-reset the machine and the\nhistory log becomes a garbled mess\nNow is there a way to make entries in history \"stick\", so CtrlR doesn't rely on a specific pattern to be present in history log? Can I define \"default entries\" in my .dotfiles somewhere, like .bashrc, or history's config?\nI know there's the option to have the history threshold set to infinity, but I don't want that.\n\nA: I used to be heavily reliant on using CtrlR to recall previously entered commands – both commonly used commands and long complicated ones. I encountered very similar issues to those you describe.\nTo overcome these problems, I modified my Bash configuration so that when the shell exits it appends to the history file rather than over-write it:\nshopt -s histappend\n\nHowever, if the shell didn’t exit cleanly (as in a hard reset), I’d still lose the history for that session so I added the following to save the history after each command is entered.\nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'\n\nShell aliases\nIn the end, I came to embrace shell aliases as the best way to save the commonly used commands and those long complicated ones that take time to get right. As long as they’re saved to my aliases file, they’ll always be available to me – even years later.\nI store all my aliases in ~/.bash_aliases and then source that file from  my .bashrc as suggested by the default .bashrc provided by Ubuntu:\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\n\nA: Not sticky, but prolong their life in history:\n#store not 2k commands but 20k, feel free to increase if needed\nexport HISTFILESIZE=20000\nexport HISTSIZE=20000\n#don't store duplicates, so save some space too\nexport HISTCONTROL=\"ignoredups\"\n\nShould be added to .bashrc\nAnd yes, aliases are very helpful.\n", "Q: How to make Nautilus list `..` for parent directory in all folders I've scoured the File Manager Preferences, GSettings and The Internet as best I can, and I cannot find the setting the hides the .. meta folder for parent directory.

It's accessible via  different URL (test.domain.com), and all the files are in the /test folder.\nAt the moment, when we want to make the new changes live (available to domain.com), we copy the files from the test/ folder to the root of the public_html/ folder, and overwrite the existing ones. This isn't convenient when deploying a completely new version because there are many files to deploy/overwrite, it takes a lot of time and the website isn't accessible or properly working during that time.\nFor the next big version, I'd like to try something different : making a symlink that redirects public_html/ to public_html/test/ instead. This way, as soon as the symlink is created, the users will see the files in the test/ folder instead, which contains the new version.\nDoes this approach work? I've read somewhere that I'd have to delete the public_html/ folder before creating the symlink, is that true, and is there a way to get around it if it is?\nIs there a better way to do this and achieve \"zero downtime development\", or pretty close to it?\n\nA: If you really want to use symbolic links, yes, you will have to move or public_html to make it a link.

What are the requirements? Running a Desktop environment? Some people achieved doing that with xming, but it's not recommended and not a setup we support here at AskUbuntu. If you just need Bash it might cover your needs, but you will need to switch your installation to receive Insider builds, because this feature hasn't been officially released yet. Insider builds are not ready for production, so you shouldn't use these unless your project is about evaluating this particular feature in its current state. Another downside is that new Insider builds are very similar to certain stages of (re-)installing Windows, they take a considerable amount of time complete and are heavy in disk utilization. (New builds land every few weeks but on occasions they can happen more than once in a week.) Clearly, it's not for production use on just one laptop you may have. (I have spare devices like a Windows Phone, an older Laptop and a VM in the fast ring, so I have some experience with Insider builds.)\nUse a VM.

Thus, it allows you to run and install/manage packages using apt-get and dpkg.\n\n*Bash/WSL is a \"Beta\" feature in Win10AU as it's not yet complete. While it runs many tools very well, its networking stack and device support in particular need work. We're continuing to add additional capabilities for future releases as rapidly as possible\n\n\nTo answer @Maryann Ethan's original question:\nYou may be able to run what you need on Bash/WSL. If you cannot, you may want to use a VM instead as @LiveWireBT suggested\nWhy/when would you use Bash/WSL vs. a VM? \nA Linux VM and the associated VM  infrastructure (e.g. Hyper-V / VirtualBox / VMWare / etc.) consumes quite a lot of space and resources. However, a VM gives a full-fidelity Linux experience.\nBash/WSL requires FAR less resources/space and sits alongside the rest of your Windows tools, apps, etc. and can directly access files on your Windows filesystem if you wish, making it very productive, very quickly. However, Bash/WSL is very new and as yet incomplete, so you may well find incompatibilities or issues.\nHTH.\n", "Q: After creating revocation certificate for OpenPGP key unable to locate it I created an OpenPGP key.

Any assistance will be appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like Windows or your computer's BIOS has kicked GRUB off. Newer PC's that come with Windows 8+ generally have an option (secure boot, enabled by default) that will check the boot loader before it can start up your computer, and if it doesn't have a certificate for that boot loader, it will not be allowed to start up the computer. This is handy because it makes it much harder for rootkits to corrupt your startup process, but it can also make it harder to dual boot with other OS's, in this case, Linux. (More info here.) I'm guessing this is why you're having trouble. I would try going into your UEFI configuration (the more modern BIOS), disable secure boot, and see if it then allows Linux to boot, although you might have to reinstall GRUB to test this, the process for which I'll explain later on. If it works, you can either leave secure boot off or try to figure out how to add a secturity certificate for GRUB so you can enjoy the security of secure boot plus the versatility of a dual-boot computer. (I've never done this, so I'm not sure how hard it is.)\nFor fixing/reinstalling GRUB, I generally use GRUB Customizer, which allows you to tweak GRUB with a GUI rather than from the terminal. Boot from a USB drive or live CD and you should be able to make changes to GRUB on your hard drive. To install it, run these commands in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\nAfter installation, it can be run from the terminal (sudo grub-customizer) or from the Unity dash. Make sure it's set to work on your hard drive and not on your USB drive; use GParted or lsblk to check your drive letters if you're not sure. As it starts up, it should detect all your bootable operating systems: Ubuntu, Advanced options for Ubuntu, Windows, and possibly also memtest86+. If there's something missing, I'm afraid I can't help you much. If, however, everything shows up, you can change the names, order, general settings, and appearance settings to suit your preferences, then select File > Save and File > Install to MBR (make sure it's targeting your hard drive). This should ensure that this GRUB configuration is installed as the first boot loader on your hard drive. If GRUB is already installed to the MBR, I think that save should be all that you need to do to apply changes, but I'm not entirely sure.\nWith that, it should be fine unless Windows attempts to reinstall its own boot loader before GRUB, but on my dual-booting desktop, I haven't had that problem.\n\nA: The procedure outlined here worked. I only needed to carry out step 3 onwards. It has to do with setting the Ubuntu image as trusted in UEFI, something which you are unlikely to stumble upon by chance.\nThe essential point is that by default Secure boot is Enabled and your laptop refuses to boot any unknown image.\nYou need to add the newly installed Ubuntu boot image to the UEFI database.\nThis is done thru the Bios(UEFI) with some simple steps. It is mandatory to set a supervisor password, but beware... make sure you write it down in a safe place. You can remove it later.\nOnce you set the password, the options below it become available.\nEnter the \"Select an UEFI file for trusted as executing\" option.\nSelect EMMC >> EFI >> Ubuntu and select the file shimx64.efi. \nYou will be prompted to give it a name of your choice (which will appear in the F12 boot options).\nType the name press Enter and then \"Yes\" should be highlighted.\nPress enter again. \nRestart the computer without any boot disk and tap F12 during the boot process.\nYou should now get the boot option menu with the name you chose.\nFinal edit: you can change the boot order in UEFI now so that it boots directly to the Grub screen.\n", "Q: Cannot get disk parameters after deployment the node I deploy the maaS node manually. When the status turned to be deployed, I start the machine again. However it says:\n\"cannot get disk parameters\"\nCould anyone told me what is the possible problems here?\n\nA: Please check BIOS setting \"boot order\" and make sure you can boot into local hard disk.\nThis error message mean \"Cannot boot into local disk after deploy\", it maybe related to hard disk and BIOS.\nYou can boot into BIOS ,load default setting , change PXE to first priority, save changes and reset and deploy again.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to the Internet, wired or wireless I have no network connections (wired or wireless). I know nothing about Ubuntu or its commands. All I can tell is that both of the interfaces are enabled but they do not connect. \nI need some commands that will enable me to get the computer to connect either one to the network or diagnose the problem to the extent that I can relay results for the next step. What do I do to even get a screen up that shows the wireless connections available?\nThanks for the help, I hope my level of knowledge is not a problem.\n\nA: In the top-right corner of the screen, there should be several icons, similar to Windows' system tray in the lower-right corner or Mac's comparable section also in the top-right corner. One of these icons should be the network service. If it's using a wired connection, it will show an arrow going up next to an arrow going down. If it's using a wireless connection, it will show a fairly standard Wi-Fi icon that also indicates signal strength. If it's offline (or networking is disabled), it will show an outline of the standard Wi-Fi icon without any bars. If any of these icons show up, you can access additional settings by clicking on it. Perhaps your issue is as simple as enabling networking or changing a few of those settings. \nBut for the remainder of this answer, I will proceed with the assumption that you are having a similar problem to the one I encountered a few weeks ago, which made the network indicator disappear entirely. So if you can see one of these icons and clicking on it brings up some network-related options, you can just skip the rest of this and let me know what it looks like.\nA few weeks ago, my work computer (running Ubuntu 14.04) randomly decided to be completely offline. It looked like the network manager service did not start at all, and starting it manually didn't help. If you're experiencing a similar-looking issue, I would start by trying to restart the network service. Run sudo service network-manager restart in the terminal. If that restores the network icon, then that may have fixed the issue. If, however, the icon is still missing, follow the instructions on this question's answer. \nAbout this bug\nUbuntu uses, among other things, some libnl packages for certain networking functions, and there was a proposed update to these packages that had some compatibility issues with the network manager service. This should only affect people that have enabled proposed updates, although I don't believe I had enabled this setting, so I'm not sure how it affected me. Regardless, it apparently did, and following the instructions linked above fixed it for me. Note that you should also be sure you place a hold on the packages so they don't get updated until the bug is fixed either with a libnl update or a network manager service update (instructions at the link above).\n", "Q: Since last update I have annoying problem with scrolling on touchpad 16.04 I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on ThinkPad T440s and since last Update (which was also the first after installing this version), I'm experiencing annoying \"jump-to-up\"s when I try to scroll with two fingers on the touchpad (I don't have a mouse, so I haven't tried it with mouse). Explained exactly, It happens when I scroll down, remove my 2 fingers and put it again on top of touchpad to scroll down further, then it scroll to top or just one page up!

I'm going to move archives and document files (which are almost all inside the home folder) to an external HDD drive with ext4 partition format. \ndoing that will solve both the space issue and wearing level of the SSD problem. There's already a guide on how to move the whole /home directory to a new partition, but the thing is I have some application related files inside home, like android SDK, Gradle build system files, Android Studio data folder (which includes plugins, configs, etc). These kind of data are mostly as hidden folders inside home directory. The whole concept of migrating to an SSD is the higher speed of accessing and running programs; by moving those files which are required by applications back to HDD, the advantage would be lost I think.\nSo I thought it's rational to just symlink that kind of folders wich comprise absolute document files (like Music, Videos, Pictures, Documents, DropBox) to the external HDD partition and leave all other config folders inside the /home folder on the SSD. This way I'd have still the concern about the .ecryptfs folder which occupies a huge space on the SSD since I have encrypted my home on Ubuntu. Would this Symlink method also move the size of the .ecryptfs folder to the HDD?\nDo you confirm this workaround or suggest an entirely different scenario?\nThanks\n\nA: This approach are fine. I suggest you also consider these issues:\nSSD technology and IO wearing\nDepending on technology of your SSD, you have also to pay attention on IO rate of some applications. High IO could decrease the life of some devices. If was the case, these files would be better linked to HDD. I believe  this approach is not only for the /home but also /var and swap area\nOS or Application Restrictions\nOn my last PC, I installed the OS on SSD and configured parts with more IO (swap area, /var and /home) to HDD. It seemed to be the ideal setting until some important applications began to fail. Ubuntu AppArmor resource was blocking output data of some applications to /var mounted on another partition. So this could be more a problem than an advantage if the user do not know how to set this restrictions.\n", "Q: Updated WiFi fix for Yoga 13 and Ubuntu 16.04?

I applied the fix descibed here (Lenovo Yoga 13 Realtek wireless driver) with 14.04 and it worked but no longer seems to with 16.04.

Most of the time it's outputting audio to the TV via HDMI (one day will be via a receiver) however occasionally I'd like to output audio to my Bluetooth headphones to avoid bothering others. The box does not have a GUI installed on it and I'd like to keep it that way.\nI don't want to install Pulseaudio if at all possible - ALSA is much simpler and seems to be better suited to Kodi.\nWhat I want to achieve:\n\n\n*\n\n*The HTPC should automatically connect to the Bluetooth headphones when I turn them on (having manually paired them once). I don't mind if there's a script running in the background periodically trying to do that.\n\n*The Bluetooth headphones should be available as a separate ALSA output device in Kodi\n\n*I don't mind manually switching the output device in Kodi from HDMI to the headphones\n\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm able to \"see\" my Bluetooth headphones using hcitool scan\n\n*I'm able to see them using bluetoothctl and pair with them, however \"connecting\" fails (I believe due to missing Pulseaudio)\n\n*I've tried defining an ALSA audio device for them (approximately following the guide here: Bluetooth/Alsa - Debian Wiki) however when I try and \"aplay\" to that device it complains about a missing .so module (libasound_module_pcm_bluetooth.so)\n\n\nHopefully someone has done this before (on a recent version of Ubuntu)\nUpdate\nI've found the reason it's looking for \"libasound_module_pcm_bluetooth.so\" is based on the \"type\" in the asound.conf declaration. So I guess I need to use one of the modules that is present on my machine (under /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/alsa-lib/).\n\nA: alsa is really not suited to hotplugging , pulseaudio is far better suited to this mode of operation. \nMy TV supports sending to bluetooth audio so i use that , with my old tv i used a dedicated bluetooth sender that i got with some Plantronic backbeat 903+ headphones. \nBluetooth generally has a noticable latency so you will need to delay the video slightly to keep it in sync, i believe kodi supports this.\n\nA: I use a Samsung TabA with Kodi and have been just using Ear Buds. Today I connected my LG 730 to the tablet. Then I turned on the movie in Kodi, next\nInserted phone plug of Ear Buds, they were working. Next I unplugged the Ear Buds and my LG started working. I watched the movie for 25 minutes listing with my LG Bluetooth until I turned the movie off. \n I hope this procedure will work for other Bluetooth listeners!!\n", "Q: no more WakeOnLan on MaaS ver. 2 as Power Type Anyone knows why the option WakeOnLan is not more present as Power Type on MaaS ?\n\nA: I can't answer why it's no longer there, but I can confirm it's not in the API anymore.  That being said, 2.0 is not in final release, and I believe is beta5, working on beta6.  An official answer would be nice if WOL is going to return or if it was removed for a reason.\nPreviously, 1.9 had ether_wake (Wake-on-LAN)\nhttps://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.9/api.html#ether-wake-wake-on-lan\nIn 2.0, it is no longer in the API.\nhttps://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/api.html#power-types\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu on different HDD? In my setup I have a 120GB SSD with Windows 10 installed. I also have a 1TB HDD, with a 35GB partition for Ubuntu.\nI want to install Ubuntu on this partition. Can I install Ubuntu on this partition and then have the PC boot to this?\nThanks, Alex\n\nA: There are a few ways to achieve this. I installed Ubuntu Mate on a 1TB HDD, with Windows 10 on an SSD. I put the GRUB2 loader on the HDD, and therefore I have to use F11, and choose to boot from the HDD at startup, whenever I want to boot Ubuntu.\nIf you dislike this way, and want to continue booting from your SSD, but still be able to choose between OSes at startup, you put the GRUB2 loader on the SSD in the install procedure. That will put Ubuntu at the top of the boot menu list, but you can move Windows up.\nEdit to answer comment: How to change the order of the boot menu, is explained in the answers to this question, so I'll link to it instead of repeating that info. The top entry will be the system booted into, unless you choose an entry further down the list, with the arrow keys and ENTER.\nHow do I change the GRUB boot order?\n", "Q: Gparted - cannot change size of SSD I have a Ubuntu 16.04 installed on my Laptop on a SSD and a Windows 7 on a HDD.\nI'd like to install Kubuntu parallel to Ubuntu on the SSD.\nNow when trying to install Kubuntu it doesn't show me the SSD in the menu when asking where I'd like to install.\nWhen using the KDE partition manager of Kubuntu's live version, are 90% of the options grayed out!\nI also can't change the size of the SSD on Ubuntu with GParted - I cant move this arrow on the right hand side and the numbers of the filesize jump back to their original value when trying to change!\nI can't even change the size of the SSD on Windows, the resize option is grayed out!\nSincerely,\nFlap\nEdit: There is a key-symbol on the partioning list of gparted (it says /dev/sda1 KEYSYMBOL, /dev/sda2 KEYSYMBOL and /dev/sda3 KEYSYMBOL.\n\nA: SOLVED:\nI was able to split the SSD with a live usb stick with Kubuntu on it. \nThe default partion manager didnt work, but I installed gparted on the live stick and could do what Ubuntu and Windows refused to do for me.\nNo idea why the other ways didnt work, but now I know that i can install programs in live-stick session!\nThanks for your great help!\n", "Q: Failed to build Pillow I'm using Kubuntu 16.04.

If so, sometimes there is a keyboard shortcut to switch between display ports. On my laptop it's FN(Located bottom left of keyboard) + F10.\nWhichever key it is will most likely have an icon on it of a monitor and laptop side by side with a line in between. \nTurns out it's FN+F7 according to the instructions of your laptop.\nhttp://www.lenovo.com/shop/americas/content/user_guides/t430_ug_en.pdf\n", "Q: how to patch the kernel from a repo I would like to patch my kernel so that it would do zerocopy. I found this nice repo on github but i'm not too sure how to go about doing it. \nhttps://github.com/Basler/linux-usb-zerocopy\nit says on the wiki that only drivers/usb/core/devio.c needs to be modified. To patch the kernel, do i simply overwrite the original with the new drivers/usb/core/devio.c and build a new kernel?\nEdit:\nI found https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel which tells me how to build my own kernel. However, it's unclear how i can merge this with my current system (ubuntu 14.04). I was able to find my kernel source directory at /usr/src and I was able to find drivers/usb/core directory. However, i wasn't able to find devio.c. Only files I found were Kconfig and Makefile. I'm not sure how to go about copying devio.c from the repo and building the kernel again. \n\nA: By looking at the GitHub repo, it seemed it is the kernel source. If only that file is modified, copy that file into the source and recompile.\n\nA: Assuming you want to patch an Ubuntu kernel (since this is askubuntu.com).\nYou can easily patch your kernel by following this wiki:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel\nTo take a patch from another Linux repo you should find the differences that repo and the Ubuntu one and merge those changes. Since both are maintained in git you can use merging or cherry-picking to accomplish this.\nSo in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download sources to Ubuntu kernel repo\n\n*Merge changes\n\n*Build and install new kernel package\n\n", "Q: how to clone Ubuntu with multiple disk with RAID 1 configuration to a new system with almost same hardware I'm wondering if it's possible to clone a pre-configured Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system to a new system with almost the same hardware.  I had some experience cloning a single drive setup but not multiple drives with RAID configuration.\nThe original system had the following hard disk configuration:\n1)  256GB SSD  -  partitioned as ext4 \"/\" and boot loader location.\n2)  1TB RAID 1 md0  -  partitioned as ext4 \"/home\"\nWhat is the best way to clone above drives to new system (with same drives setup)?  And what is the proper process?\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: you can use a fork of old program \"remastersys\", called \"linux respin\", it has available a gui for using desktop environment , and either a script for command line.. \nessentially it does put all (not the folders explicitly excluded into the configuration file file)  into an iso that you can write into a cd or pen drive usb or virtual environment..\nAnd most important it doesn't matter the new hardware characteristics, it will run as live or if you want you can install using the icon into the desktop on all machine you want.and in either cases you will have already  the old configuration files and folders (data included)!\nBeware only to 32/64bit because you cannot install 64bit into 32bit hardware..\nCheers\n", "Q: How do I configure Docker to use ZFS?

When I plug it in, Ubuntu automatically connects it sometimes.  However, it doesn't do anything other times.  Restarting, reconnecting, etc. only seems to help once out of so many tries.  \nWhen it connects, it shows as wired connection 1.  However, there is just no way to invoke Connect manually in the UI.  What command do I run to manually start the connecting process after plugging in the device? (i.e. when it does nothing automatically).  The connection thing is never a given when you plug in the device or even when you restart.  Enabling/Disabling Networking doesn't make a lot of difference.  Is there a script I could run or a command I could invoke after plugging in the device to try connecting it?  Any help appreciated.\nTo clarify more: The device is sometimes recognized and connected automatically.  Most of the time however, it just blinks there and Ubuntu doesn't connect it automatically.  It's listed under lsusb however.  As a result, the temptation is strong to never disconnect it once it has successfully connected after plugging, unplugging, restarting etc.. Because you never know when it's going to connect again.  Surely there must be a better way.  Even if it is a set of steps that included restarting that always works.\n\nA: So that this can help others going through the same thing, here's how I solved it.  When it connected, it was almost always connected in Mass Storage mode.  lsusb listed it as Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E353/E3131 (Mass storage mode).  After upgrading to the latest ubuntu, it actually started listing the files in the mass storage mode.  It has linux installation files which you can use.

The parameter expansion syntax ${0%/*} removes the shortest suffix from $0 matching /* leaving (respectively) path/to or just . and the script then attempts to change to this directory - in other words, to the parent directory of start.sh\nHowever, when you use sh start.sh (as well as executing the script using sh instead of the intended /bin/bash), $0 equals start.sh. Since there's no matching /, ${0%/*} doesn't remove anything from $0, resulting in the script trying to execute the command cd start.sh which obviously fails because start.sh is a file not a directory.\nThe solution is to execute the script the way the author presumably intended - that is, by ensuring it is executable\nchmod +x start.sh\n\nand then executing it directly, e.g.\n./start.sh\n\n", "Q: Trouble with GNOME in 16.04 LTS I just installed Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 LTS on a laptop.

I would like to copy recursively all files and folders to an external exFat volume using cp -R but when I try I get many errors which look like: \ncp: cannot create regular file ‘/media/How About Better Parents?.pdf’: No such file or directory\n\nIs there a way to copy these filenames which contain valid but special characters?\n\nA: You’ll have to use a filesystem other than exFAT. According to the Wikipedia article, the allowed characters in filenames are:\n\nUnicode UTF-16 except\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*U+0000 (NUL) through U+001F (US)\n  \n*/ (slash)\n  \n*\\ (backslash)\n  \n*: (colon)\n  \n** (asterisk)\n  \n*? (Question mark)\n  \n*\" (quote)\n  \n*< (less than)\n  \n*> (greater than)\n  \n*| (pipe)\n  \n\n\nA: You could do this in steps, creating a list of the files and the new name for each.  You would probably have to create the target directories first.  If the directory structure is relatively flat you could do that manually with mkdir -p path.  If there are many directories but they don't contain spaces or illegal target characters you could use (say from /dvd to /media)\ncd /media ; ( cd /dvd ; find . -type d ) | xargs mkdir -p\n\nThis places you in the target directory (ready for the mkdir) and then lists all directories below the source directory, sending those to mkdir.  You may be able to use find option -print0 together with xargs option -0 if you need spaces in directory names.\nThen use find to create the list of files to be copied, say with\ncd /dvd ; find . -type f | sed 's/\\(.*\\)/cp \"\\1\" \"\\1\"/' > /tmp/copy.sh\n\nThen edit the file /tmp/copy.sh replacing all illegal characters in the target names.  For each file name the sed command inserts cp before it, then the filename inside double quotes (source), and the filename inside double quotes again (target).  Once you have this looking acceptable make copy.sh executable and run it.\nDisclaimer: as always it's possible to copy files to the wrong place, fill a file system, etc, so try a few commands manually and check the result before running a whole mass of them.  You could test the xargs mkdir command by trying xargs echo mkdir first to see what it will do.\n", "Q: How can I get slowmoVideo installed on Ubuntu 14.04?

(PlayOnLinux I assume?)\n\n\nSince it's good practice to offer the slides after a presentation was held, do you think it's a good idea to make your audience suffer through the same path of hurdles and incompatibilities?\nReasons to avoid PDF & Flash\nPDF & Flash is one of the most terrible combinations from the past. PDF itself is an overused format, embedding Java, Javascript or Flash makes it equally dangerous as using macros in other document formats and many users closely associate PDFs with printable documents.\nI'm surprised to see that people still consider using such functionality which has been discouraged for many years and disabled in many existing implementations by default, yet it is one of the major ways users recently again got infected with crypto trojans.\nShow some sense of responsibility! Realize, your whole attitude of Linux and Free Desktop users are safe because we are better than the big bad companies just went down the toilet.\nFurthermore this is not how we use computers or computing devices to view documents today. Most browsers have a PDF renderer built in, all of them want to abandon Flash and have road maps for that. Flash isn't available on mobile platforms and embedded Flash players aren't very user friendly by todays standards.\nAlternatives\nBrowsers are more suited for presentations with multimedia content on all major platforms these days. A completely Javascript free solution doesn't appear to be available or popular right now, but browser based presentations are state of the art today. One solution I found was reveal.js.  \n", "Q: Transplanting Drive Two Elitebook HP laptops (different models) use the same type SATA drive.  Ubuntu 16.04 was installed on laptop A.  If it is transplanted to laptop B, can I expect it to work correctly if I haven't done any important modification to the default settings? \nI realize that I can simply perform the transplant, however, it makes sense to pose the question to avoid any landmines and avoid wasting time.\n\nA: Assuming you're using the stock kernel (with no dependency on particular hardware), and the CPU architecture is the same (x86, amd-64, etc), there's no reason why swapping the HDD would prevent Ubuntu from booting. Check /etc/modules and /etc/modules.d for any hardware-specific tweaks you may have done on laptop A which may cause issues when applied to laptop B.\nI wouldn't bother removing any 3rd party drivers you had to install for laptop A hardware. Such drivers (e.g. AMD Catalyst) often don't cope well with package managers, so during the uninstall they can alter or remove files used by something else in your system. I have a first-hand experience when removing Catalyst from a Lenovo laptop resulted in a broken system.\nAnother kettle of fish you may want to check is Xorg configuration: if you had to tweak /etc/X11/xorg.conf to get hardware acceleration or multi-screen desktop on laptop A, those setting may prevent the X server to start properly on laptop B, and though your system will still boot you won't get the desktop environment you're familiar with. If your plan is to permanently transfer the HDD to laptop B, I'd recommend to simply delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf (making a backup beforehand) to let the X server do the autodetection.\nI cannot foresee any issues that could arise from transferring the HDD from laptop A to laptop B.\n\nA: When Rinzwind mentioned the NIC it reminded me of a potential gotcha. There is likely a file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. It \"hardcodes\" the first laptop's MAC address. So, in the second laptop a number of possibilities can happen. Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*No problem (in a pure DHCP LAN where you don't care about what IP you're given)\n\n*No problem except that the NIC will be eth1 instead of eth0.\n\n*Problem where other things depend on the interface being eth0.\n\n\nThe easy fix is to sudo rm 70-persistent-net.rules and reboot.\nCaveat: I'm basing this on Debian. Ubuntu may be different.\n\nA: Yes you can clone one HDD to another. I used to do it all the time with clonezilla for work. You can download clonzilla for free at the link below.\nhttp://clonezilla.org/downloads.php\n\nA: Yes, you can take out the hard disk from one and insert it into the 2nd notebook.\n1 thing you need to do before though: remove 3rd party drivers. There are probably 2 you need to check: drivers for your video card and your NIC. Re-install those drivers on the new notebook.\nBoth being HP -might- have them have the same hardware (or nearly the same) so it could work without removing 3rd party drivers. \n", "Q: Disable partners key in url bar How I can disable in Google client=ubuntu (in DDG t=canonical) in Firefox 47?\nSee screenshot:\n\nUPD: \nThat's all what i find about subj, \n>strings /usr/lib/firefox/libxul.so | grep \"client=\" -n\n208606:  GetCacheSession for client=%s, policy=%d\nbut more interesting about Canonical partners.

So if somebody can help me with this I will be very grateful.  \n\nA: First of all, your sda has a GPT partition table and your sdb has an msdos/MBR partition table. That's an incompatibility. For GRUB (Ubuntu's bootloader) to install correctly, you need to have both devices (sda and sdb) with the same type of partition table (either both MBR, either both GPT). Since GPT is more advanced than msdos/MBR, it's clever to use GPT for both.  \nBoot into Win10 and use Rufus to create a GPT partition table for your USB device, then create a new FAT partition on USB, and write the Ubuntu ISO file again on the new FAT partition of the USB device. \nReboot and start Ubuntu from the USB in live mode. Open GParted, create a ext partition after the Win10 partition. Create a swap partition after the ext partition. Apply changes, close GParted and click on the Install Ubuntu icon.  \nUbuntu installer will offer several install schemes, choose Install Ubuntu  alongside Win10, and point to the ext partition as the installation partition. When asked about GRUB installation location, choose /sda (the root of your internal disk). Make sure it's not any particular partition like /sda1, /sda5, /sdb1, etc. Ubuntu installer should automatically recognize the EFI partition. If not, it might ask you where to boot from. You should indicate to /boot/efi for that. That's about it. Wait for the installer to finish and you'll have a dual-boot.  \nP.S. If you never had a dual-boot before, you should expect GRUB to pop-up at startup instead of Windows bootloader (winboot). That's perfectly normal, since GRUB can recognize winboot, but winboot can't recognize GRUB (that's a microsoft manufacturing defect). There can be no dual-boot without GRUB.\n", "Q: How can I view binary .log files with application/octet-stream mime type? I have downloaded some log files from my server which I want to search for a specific string for debugging purposes. All of them have the .log extension.\nThe problem is that one file has the plain text document (text/plain) mime type while the other has the Binary (application/octet-stream) mime type.\nI can open the plain text document (text/plain) mime type log file in a text editor as plain text but the other I can't since it's in binary.\nHow can I view the binary .log files with application/octet-stream mime type?\n\n\nA: From this answer in What makes grep consider a file to be binary?\n\nIf there is a NUL character anywhere in the file, grep will consider it as a binary file.\nThere might a workaround like this cat file | tr -d '\\000' | yourgrep to eliminate all null first, and then to search through file.\n\n\nI first tried it with one file in a test directory:\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ ls\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ cat info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518 | tr -d '\\000' > info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518_edited\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ ls\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518_edited\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$\n\nAnd the result, a plain text document (text/plain) text mime file.\n\nThen since I am working with multiple files, I tried running the same command for multiple files in a directory:\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ ls\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160520  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160523  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160525\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ for i in * ; do cat \"$i\" | tr -d '\\000' > \"${i}_edited\" ; done\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$ ls\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518         info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160520_edited  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160525\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160518_edited  info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160523         info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160525_edited\ninfo_pdslpostpaid.log-20160520         info_pdslpostpaid.log-20160523_edited\nparto@subroot:~/Desktop/test$\n\nAnd awesome, all my log files are now in a readable format!! :)\n\nA: Based on your own answer, you seem to be referring specifically to searching files using grep, rather than to changing a file's mime-type - see What is the XY problem?.\nIf grep is simply misidentifying the files based on null bytes, then you can use the -a or --binary-files=text options to tell grep to treat them as text regardless, as described in the manual pages:\n-a, --text\n       Process  a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to\n       the --binary-files=text option.\n\n--binary-files=TYPE\n       If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains\n       binary  data, assume that the file is of type TYPE.  By default,\n       TYPE is binary, and grep  normally  outputs  either  a  one-line\n       message  saying  that  a  binary  file matches, or no message if\n       there is no match.  If TYPE is without-match, grep assumes  that\n       a  binary  file  does  not  match;  this is equivalent to the -I\n       option.  If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as if  it\n       were  text;  this is equivalent to the -a option.  Warning: grep\n       --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can  have\n       nasty  side  effects  if  the  output  is  a terminal and if the\n       terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.\n\n", "Q: Layer and toolbox window doesn't appear when I reopen GIMP after closing it using the launcher If I close GIMP with the x on its window, everything works fine.\n\nBut most of the time I have so many images open that I do not want to close each individually.

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: What you're describing has to be a failure of either the battery voltage sensor, Ubuntu's driver or handler for that sensor, or of the battery itself.  Long run life rules out bad cells that would display as a dead battery, so it's either a sensor failure or a software issue.  Try booting from live media (DVD or USB) and see if the battery display still reads zero.  If it does, you have a hardware problem; otherwise, it's an issue with the software that reads and displays the output of the sensor and can likely be corrected with software solutions (reinstalling one or more packages, or worst case reinstalling Ubuntu clean).\nI'm guessing it's the sensor (a software failure would likely give some result other than a consistent zero reading, such as loss of the battery icon entirely), but I don't know, for that machine, if that's inside the battery housing or on the machine's motherboard.  If the battery is removable, you may be able to buy a replacement battery at a reasonable price from a third party (not Apple).\nWith bad cells ruled out, the only harm you'll risk by running with the machine as is, is not knowing how much run time you have left, so that's an option (adding a countdown timer widget set for less than your tested battery life would help avoid unexpected shutdowns).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 prevent screen turning off in lock screen Every time when I am in lock screen, the screen will automatically turn off.

The recommended way to install Eclipse is to use the Software Centre, or if you need a different version of Eclipse to the one in the Ubuntu repositories (3.8.1-8 for Xenial), to add a PPA. Using the official repositories or a PPA will ensure that you get relevant updates.\nThat said, I'll attempt to answer what each of the steps do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads a .tar.gz file, a gzipped tar archive. Like a zip file with a structure of directories and files within.\n\n*Unzip and extract the tar archive using a tar command, the options are -x for extract, -z for unzip (actually gunzip), -v for verbose to tell you what it's doing. This will unzip the Eclipse files into whichever directory you're in at the time.\n\n*sudo mv eclipse /opt/ - moves the eclipse directory and all contents into the /opt/ directory, the place where all external packages should be installed.\nsudo cd /opt/ - move into /opt/. \nsudo chown -R root:root eclipse - make all files and directories inside /opt/eclipse owned by the user and group of root.\nsudo chmod -R +r eclipse - make all the eclipse files and directories readable to user, groups and others.\n\n*Create the file in /usr/bin/ to launch eclipse from /opt. Essentially this file is a Bash script which sets and exports the path to eclipse as the variable ECLIPSE_HOME. The actual binary, or program  is stored in the file /opt/eclipse/eclipse, so when you call that bash script, you are saying, launch eclipse from the path /opt/eclipse/eclipse. The $* means that you pass it any command line arguments as they're passed to the shell script. This script is given octal permissions 755, so that everyone can use the shell script, but only root (or a sudo user) can rewrite the script.\n\n*The final step creates a desktop file to launch the shell script, and by extension launch eclipse.\n\n\nYou shouldn't really be using an outdated tutorial for Ubuntu 11.04, but I understand wanting to know what the steps are that this tutorial is telling you.

There have been several bugs filed on this, with other potentially worse issues like having the machine's native boot entry changed. See bugs 1173457, 1229488, ... and many more if you search.  Add yourself to any bugs you feel affect you.  \nThe solution is simple, just mount the USB's EFI partition and copy everything from the hard disk's EFI partition.  Then, copy the Ubuntu bootloaders shimx64.efi and grubx64.efi from .../EFI/ubuntu to .../EFI/Boot/ and rename the .../EFI/.Boot/  shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi.  That's the bootloader used for removable media.  It still requires the grub.cfg file be in EFI/ubuntu, so leave it there.  Remember, these are all just files on a FAT filesystem.  You can copy and rename them from the Windows filemanager just as easily as from a Linux system.\nDo back up your hard disk's EFI partition, using USB installs may change things.

But it's not really installed. \nSo I installed it via terminal using:\n$ sudo dpkg -i rstudio-0.99.902-i386.deb \nSelecting previously unselected package rstudio.\n(Reading database ... 175645 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack rstudio-0.99.902-i386.deb ...\nUnpacking rstudio (0.99.902) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of rstudio:\n rstudio depends on libjpeg62; however:\n  Package libjpeg62 is not installed.\n rstudio depends on libgstreamer0.10-0; however:\n  Package libgstreamer0.10-0 is not installed.\n rstudio depends on libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0; however:\n  Package libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0 is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing package rstudio (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info (1.5-2) ...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-6ubuntu3) ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1ubuntu5) ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon (0.5.3~bzr0+16.04.20160415-0ubuntu1) ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcessing triggers for mime-support (3.59ubuntu1) ...\nProcessing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme (0.15-0ubuntu1) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n rstudio\n\nWhat are the steps to rectify this error?\n\nA: Your best bet is to use gdebi to do RStudio installations. It automatically resolves dependencies (unlike dpkg).\nsudo apt-get install gdebi-core\nsudo gdebi rstudio-0.99.902-i386.deb\n\nIn fact, that's what RStudio themselves recommends for rstudio-server installation.\n\nA: Installing from a .deb file through dpkg does not resolve dependency issues the same way installation through apt will. After running the sudo dpkg -i yourpackage.deb, you should run sudo apt-get install -f to fix and complete the installation if any errors were encountered by dpkg.\n\nA: For me it worked like this:\nAdd the following entry in /etc/apt/sources.list file\ndeb https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/\n\nAll the mirrors are listed here:\nYou can find out your corresponding Ubuntu release by doing this on command line\nlsb_release -a\n\nAfter that\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install r-base\n\n\nA: I had the same problem but i downloaded the dependency from the link below \nhttps://debian.pkgs.org/9/debian-main-amd64/libjpeg62-turbo_1.5.1-2_amd64.deb.html\nfollowed by \nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter downloading the zipped file use\nsudo dpkg -i libjpeg62-turbo_1.5.1-2_amd64.deb\n\nto install the deb file to solve the dependency issues. \nAfter that try and install R studio with\nsudo dpkg -i rstudio-xenial-1.1.379-amd64.deb\n\nand this should solve the problem. This should solve the problem and even if your software installer on ubuntu is not working.\nPlease and in case you see any other dependencies that you need to download just download it and use the above procedure and it should work. \nhope this works for you.\n\nA: For me, it worked when I've installed the follow dependencies: \nlibgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0_0.10.36-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb\nlibgstreamer0.10-0_0.10.36-1.5ubuntu1_amd64.deb \nlibjpeg62-turbo_1.5.2-2+b1_amd64.deb\nAll from https://packages.ubuntu.com/\n", "Q: /dev/ttyS* permission denied Answers posted so far have not really addressed a good solution.\nJust installed 15.10 and get permission denied on bootup or reboot, even after changing them to crw-rw-rw from crw-rw----!\n\nA: You need to add the current user to dialout group.\nRun\nsudo usermod -aG dialout $USER\n\nThen you will be allowed to write to /dev/ttyS* after log off and log on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Redshift fails to launch on startup I am posting this as a solution to a problem that I could not find anywhere on Google.\nRedshift will not launch on startup as it has issues gathering longitude and latitude from geoclue. The issue appears to be with geoclue failing to get the users location.\nTrying the following in terminal DOES NOT work for me:\nredshift-gtk -l 55.7:12.6\n\nI get an error stating too many arguments.\n\nA: Here's what I did to get it to work:\n1) Under applications, go to Startup Applications. If an entry for Redshift already exists then click on it and then click on edit. Otherwise, click add. Set name to Redshift and set the comment to whatever you want. For the command, enter:\ngtk-redshift -l manual\n\nClick save.\n2) In your home folder press ctrl+h and that should list all of the hidden folders(folders beginning with a '.'). Go into your .config folder and create a new file and call it redshift.conf. Paste the following:\n; Global settings\n[redshift]\ntemp-day=6500K\ntemp-night=5000\ntransition=1\n;gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8\ngamma=1.000:1.000:1.000\nlocation-provider=geoclue\n;location-provider=manual\nadjustment-method=vidmode\n;brightness=1.0:0.5\n\n; The location provider and adjustment method settings\n; are in their own sections.\n; This is an example lat long for Portland, OR\n[manual]\nlat=YOURLAT\nlon=YOURLON\n\n; In this example screen 1 is adjusted by vidmode. Note\n; that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually\n; the second screen.\n;[vidmode]\n;screen=1\n\nGo here to get your latitude and longitude and replace 'YOURLAT' and 'YOURLON' with the respective values. Save and close the file. Restart computer and Redshift should have started(indicated by the lightbulb icon the the menu bar).\nSo, hopefully this helps someone. If this is against the rules or anything for whatever reason I apologize. Hopefully this helps someone out there.\n\nA: while the above answer put me on the right path, there are a few things that can be improved.  if you add the config location-provider=manual then you don't need any extra command line arguments and just running redshift or redshift-gtk will load your config file lat/long.\ni don't know why geoclue is busted on ubuntu, but since this is for my desktop computer, the location doesn't change much\nhere is my modified config.  see the docs here http://jonls.dk/redshift/#configuration-file\n; Global settings\n[redshift]\ntemp-day=5700\ntemp-night=3500\n\ntransition=0\n\n; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel\n; individually)\ngamma=0.8\n\n;location-provider=geoclue\nlocation-provider=manual\n\n; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode'\n; type 'redshift -m list' to see all possible values.\n; 'randr' is the preferred method, 'vidmode' is an older API.\n; but works in some cases when 'randr' does not.\n; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.\nadjustment-method=randr\n\n;brightness=1.0:0.5\n\n; The location provider and adjustment method settings\n; are in their own sections.\n; This is an example lat long for Portland, OR\n[manual]\n\nlat=49.000  ;  YOUR LAT GOES HERE\nlon=-123.000 ; YOUR LONG GOES HERE\n\n", "Q: Evolution mail says I have 700 mails but my inbox is empty My inbox is empty when I try to link gmail to evolution mail client,  anyone can help?\n\nA: Found the solution,  I turned on \"lesser secure\" on my gmail account and everything works.\nHere is the link:\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps\nSimply click activate\n", "Q: over-coming interactive command in a script I'm trying to have a script to create containers on proxmox, & I want user to enter his password before proceeding to the creation of container, so I can push it to the main command.\nthe command line that asks the user about his password is :\npct create ID Path_to_template  -password\n\nduring the process, the user will be asked to enter a new password, but I want to use the password I recieved earlier. is there a way to push it during the execution pct ?\nis there anyway this can be done ?\n\nA: I found this simple script to get the job done:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to add a user to Linux system\nif [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then\n    read -p \"Enter username : \" username\n    read -s -p \"Enter password : \" password\n    egrep \"^$username\" /etc/passwd >/dev/null\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"$username exists!\"\n        exit 1\n    else\n        pass=$(perl -e 'print crypt($ARGV[0], \"password\")' $password)\n        useradd -m -p $pass $username\n        [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo \"User has been added to system!\" || echo \"Failed to add a user!\"\n    fi\nelse\n    echo \"Only root may add a user to the system\"\n    exit 2\nfi\n\n\nA: use expect .Expect lets you automate user interaction on shell(entering password, ssh...).There you can find some examples that suit your needs.

I'm hoping that changes now.\nThe goal:\nRun /var/www/lager-scanner/filer/pluk_script.py whenever there is a new file in /var/www/lager-scanner/filer/Nav/FromNav, and run this as the www-data user.\nIs there someone out there how can tell me how to do that?\nAll the folders in /var/www are owned by the www-data user and group and have 775 permissions.\n\nA: Not a dupe, but in the accepted answer on this question, it is explained how to run a script (or any command) whenever a file is added or created in an arbitrary directory. In your case, the only needed event- trigger is:\n-e create\n\nFurthermore, since you are not using the path to the file as an argument, you can skip the --format -section.\nThe script to run in the background then simply is:\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=\"/var/www/lager-scanner/filer/Nav/FromNav\"\ninotifywait -m -r -e create \"$DIR\" | while read f\n\ndo\n    # you may want to release the monkey after the test :)\n    echo monkey\n    # <whatever_command_or_script_you_liketorun>\ndone\n\nExplanation\nAs explained in the linked question:\n-e create\n\nwill notice new files created inside the directory.\nThe options:\n-m -r \n\nare to make the command run indefinitely (\"monitor\") and recursively in the directory.\nAccording to this, using pyinotify is not the best option.\nEDIT\nIn a comment you mention it does not work, and you mention the targeted folder is remote. Although not exactly the same, the issue seems related to this: \nthe change is not visible to the kernel; it happens entirely remotely.\nA (tested) work around is to mount the remote folder locally.\n\nA: Here is a trimmed down version of the example from the inotify page on PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inotify) to get you started:\nimport inotify.adapters\nimport os\n\nnotifier = inotify.adapters.Inotify()\nnotifier.add_watch('/home/student')\n\nfor event in notifier.event_gen():\n    if event is not None:\n        # print event      # uncomment to see all events generated\n        if 'IN_CREATE' in event[1]:\n             print \"file '{0}' created in '{1}'\".format(event[3], event[2])\n             os.system(\"your_python_script_here.py\")\n\nIt creates a Inotify object then adds a directory to watch using the add_watch() method.  Next it creates a event generator from the Inotify object using the event_gen() method.  Finally it iterate overs that generator \nNow file operations that affect the watched directory will generate one or more events.  Each event takes the form of a tuple with four values:\n\n\n*\n\n*An _INOTIFY_EVENT tuple (omitted in the output below for clarity)\n\n*A list of strings describing the events\n\n*The name of the directory affected\n\n*The name of the file affected\n\n\nRunning the above example with the first print statement uncommented and then creating the file 'new' in the watched directory gives this output:\n\n( (...), ['IN_CREATE'], '/home/student', 'new')    \nfile 'new' created in '/home/student'\n( (...), ['IN_ISDIR', 'IN_OPEN'], '/home/student', '')\n( (...), ['IN_ISDIR', 'IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE'/home/student', '')\n( (...), ['IN_OPEN'], '/home/student', 'new')\n( (...), ['IN_ATTRIB'], '/home/student', 'new')\n( (...), ['IN_CLOSE_WRITE'], '/home/student', 'new')\n\nSince the 'IN_CREATE' event occurs when a new file is created, this is where you would add whatever code you wanted to run.\n", "Q: How to connect two differents virtual machines (VirtualBox) using IPv6 and gateway I am trying to create a virtual machine and clonate it. When I have the copy, I try to connect them using IPv6 but I don't know how I can do it.\nThis two virtual machines are Ubuntu 14.04.\nI need a IPv6 direction and gateway different in each virtual machine, but I don't know how I can obtain it.\nI have see a lot of different pages and when I do ping6 ipv6.google.com I obtain connect: Network is unreachable\nI have to say also that I am an amateur user in Ubuntu.\nIn /etc/network/interfaces I have the next:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\niface lo inet6 loopback\n\nCan anybody help me, please?\n\nA: If you can't ping ipv6.google.com then your computer's internet connection probably doesn't support IPv6.  If you go to http://ipv6test.google.com/, that web page will tell you if you have IPv6.\nIf you just want your virtual machines to be able to access web sites and such with IPv6, then that should be automatic if your computer has IPv6 connectivity.  If you want the virtual machines to be able to talk to each other and the host OS using IPv6, then you will want to create a virtual \"host-only\" network and connect your virtual machines to it.  To do that I seem to remember that you first create a virtual host-only network in VirtualBox.  Then you add a second virtual network interface card to each virtual machine, and configure the new virtual NIC to connect to the virtual host-only network.  I would recommend getting IPv4 connectivity working first, and then IPv6.  VirtualBox automatically provides a virtual DNS server on a virtual host-only network, so IPv4 connectivity should be automatic.  I'm not sure how it would work on IPv6; you might need to give each virtual machine a static IPv6 address.\nGood luck and have fun!\n", "Q: How to close application from terminal same way as exiting it properly Usually when running application in graphical environment, when I want to close it I click X in the top left corner of the window or go to File > Close.\nI would like to sometimes close these programs remotely over ssh from terminal using command line, now I use kill command but I wonder it it does the same as exiting the application properly from itself.\nFrom man kill default signal appears to be 15) SIGTERM, is this signal going to tell the application I am trying to close to clean up, close open files, save stuff?\nIs there a better way if I want to do it from terminal?\n\nA: I think it's worth adding that wmctrl -xl will output results like this:\n0x03000001 -1 google-chrome.google-chrome  dcentore-pc Rybak - Google Play Music - Google Chrome\n0x04600006  0 speedcrunch.Speedcrunch  dcentore-pc SpeedCrunch\n\nWhere the x requests the window class to be in the output. This is often the easiest way to close the same program every time. Then, we can just supply the window class when closing it:\nwmctrl -xc speedcrunch.Speedcrunch\n\nThis example will close speedcrunch.\n\nA: The typical way to close application gracefully is to use kill -TERM 1234 , where 1234 is the PID of the window. Problem, however, is that graphical applications are designed to listen for a specific signal from X server itself , not listening for the TERM signal.  \nThat means you would need some kind of agent in between you and the X server to communicate that you want to send appropriate signal. You can of course write a C program, however there aready exists wmctrl program ( not-surprisingly written in C ) that does exactly that.\nUsage of wmctrl is simple:\nwmctrl -c :SELECT: # close window that will be selected with pointer\nwmctrl -c :ACTIVE: # close currently active window\nwmctrl -ic <numeric id> # close window with specific id in hex\n\nIt's not installed by default, so get it with sudo apt-get install wmctrl\nThere's many uses for wmctrl is far beyond just closing windows, so please see more of my answers and Jacob Vlijm's for examples of scripts where it's been used\n", "Q: Could not extract .bin file I can not extract .bin file on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nError message:\nroot@ilgar-Ubuntu:~# '/home/ilgar/jre-6u21-linux-i586.bin' \nUnpacking...\nChecksumming...\nExtracting...\n/home/ilgar/jre-6u21-linux-i586.bin: 86: /home/ilgar/jre-6u21-linux-i586.bin: ./install.sfx.10336: not found\nFailed to extract the files.

When typing if I happen to also be touching the touchpad the screen flashes, temporarily going black. It doesn't happen when I type this (in firefox), but it happens in the Gnome terminal and the gedit text editor, and even with the calculator. I never encountered this problem with 15.10. Perhaps I was just lucky and never touched the touchpad while typing, but that's unlikely.\nIs there some fix for this or should I report it as a bug? If I should report it, how do I do that?\nEDIT: It also seems to do it occasionally without touching the touchpad but just when typing.\nEDIT2: About the graphics card, from lspci -v\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor\nIntegrated Graphics Controller (rev 02) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Dell Latitude E6410\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 26\n    Memory at f0000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]\n    Memory at e0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\n    I/O ports at 70b0 [size=8]\n    Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]\n    Capabilities: <access denied>\n    Kernel driver in use: i915\n    Kernel modules: i915\n\n\nA: I have had exactly this issue. \nThat is to say when keying text into terminal/vim/whatever any inadvertent touch of the touchpad doesn't just move the cursor but also causes the screen to flash. \nYes, it is possible to disable the touchpad when typing and there are good reasons to do this if palm detection isn't enough to stop the cursor flying about as you type. But I agree with the original post: doing this doesn't fix the underlying issue, it just makes it less likely to happen because it becomes impossible to register a keystroke and a cursor movement at the same time.\nIt's also worth pointing out that I am not talking about 'flickering' here (as reported elsewhere) but an effect akin to a  visual bell i.e the whole screen flashes. Perhaps this is in fact what is happening: making a keystroke and a cursor movement via the touchpad at the same time is an illegal operation? \nRe-installing 14.04 completely resolves the issue for me.\nI am/was running 16.04 on a  Dell Latitude with i5.\n", "Q: ./configure is showing no such file or directory?

As in I just put in country codes and it auto populates the current list from somewhere then appended my block range. Making it easy to updates for the list of address as they change. But to start with I used country ip blocks\nto find a list of addresses for China and saved them to a text file titled \"chinaiprange.txt\"\nAfter some searching I found the following command to enter them all in at once from this example\nwhile read line; do sudo ufw insert 1 deny from $line to any; done < chinaiprange.txt\nHowever when I run it I recieve the following output:ERROR: Bad source address\nThe addresses are saved in the following format:\n1.0.1.0/24 \n1.0.2.0/23\n1.0.8.0/21\n...\n\nIf there is a better way to do this that would be great but letting me know what I am doing wrong would be just as awesome. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I don't think there's anything wrong with the syntax of your command (either of the ufw command itself, or the bash loop - although it would be good practice to quote the $line variable i.e. ... from \"$line\" to any ...).\nThe ERROR: Bad source address error indicates a problem with the address string itself, and we can guess that it might be due to DOS-style CR-LF line endings - which you were able to confirm by opening the chinaiprange.txt file in nano\nThe solution is to fix the line endings, using any of the well known methods such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*running your file through the dos2unix command\n\n*using tr or sed - for example sed -i 's/\\r$//' chinaiprange.txt\n\n*opening the file in vi and executing :set ff=unix followed by :wq to re-save\n\n\nA: Re-read man ufw.

I know I can do find -name filename but how can I do it for file type?\n\nA: -name '*.py' since -name accepts a pattern.\nMind the single quotes.\n\nA: Not all python files will have the file extension .py - Try running grep -rni python /usr/bin for example). Most of these scripts will have a 'shebang' (or hashbang) line (e.g. #!/usr/bin/env python, #!/usr/bin/python2.7). This informs the interpreter of the script which program needs to be used to run it, and you could search for this to find python files\nHowever, you can also use the file's mimetype (usually along the lines of text/x-python) to find it:\nfind / -type f | while read in ; do if file -i \"${in}\" | grep -q x-python ; then echo \"${in}\" ; fi ; done\n\nWhere / is your intended search directory.\nWith find you could also add the -executable option to look for only executable files. Also the use of -type f restrict find to look only for files - you could change this and then show symbolic links etc as well (some scripts are contained in /usr/lib etc and symlinked to /usr/bin/ etc). Many more options are available, you can see these by running man find.\nfile should be able to guess the filetype even if the file has no extension etc (using the shebang line etc) - see here.\nTo removed any find: ‘/.../FILE’: Permission denied etc errors, you can run the script as root (using sudo bash -c \"COMMAND\", opening a shell with sudo su etc), and/or simply append 2>/dev/null to the find command.\n\nA: sudo find / -name \"*.py\"\nYou only need sudo to avoid Permission denieds (since you're searching from the root). \n", "Q: openstack installer missing on new install I just downloaded and install 16.04 latest, and run the openstack install steps, and get an error that openstack-install can't be found.  \"command not found\"\nIs something missing in the install files?\nwhen I run find, the file really doesn't exist on my computer.\n\nA: Here is the solution:\nsudo apt install conjure-up    \nconjure-up openstack\n\n\nA: sudo apt install conjure-up    \n\nThen disable IPv6:  \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -p medium lxd \n\nThen run:\nconjure-up openstack\n\n", "Q: E:Type 'sudo' is not known on line 53 in source list I have done some looking around for a solution.

You will get a USB devices list where each line looks like this:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 17ef:1004 Lenovo Integrated Webcam\n\nNotice the number right after ID.  In this case it's ID 17ef.  This number is the device's Vendor number, in this case Lenovo.\n\n*As root, create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules. Open it with a text editor like gedit for example and add this line:  \nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"17ef\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"\n\nOf course you must replace 17ef with the vendor number of your device (list).\n\n*Save the file and you're good to go. The first time Android Studio detects your device, it will send an SHA1 number to the device and you have to accept it for the connection to be made.

What does \"already hardware poisoned\" mean? How to solve it?\n\nA: The processor is responding to a Machine Check Exception (MCE) on a page of memory. An MCE is hardware error and may be one of the following:\n1) A system bus error (data error between the processor and the motherboard).\n2) Memory error: a parity check detected a memory error. \n3) Processor cache errors.\nIn your case, I suspect a memory parity check failure occurred and the kernel attempted to use the error correction code (ECC) to try to fix this, but there were too many bits corrupted so it could not.\nThe first kernel message is informing you that the corrupt page of memory is a page used by the kernel itself and is being shared/used by just 1 user.\nThe second kernel message is informing you that the page error could not be restored/fixed.\nThe final kernel message refers to the fact that hardware detected the memory error, the page was tagged as needing fixing \"aka poisoned\" and later on when the page has been read the MCE occurred and it repored the fact that the page had been tagged as poisoned.  This is a lazy operation because sometimes a page can become corrupt but it is then later written to so it is never read, so there is no need to fix it up.\nSince this is a hardware error it may be due to physical issues, or maybe just a random bit flips caused by cosmic rays. If it occurs frequently, check that the memory is seated properly. \n", "Q: Help with wireless rtl8723be So I was having connection problems in linux only and then found this: https://chirath02.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/installing-realtek-rtl8723be-driver-for-ubuntu-16-04/\nAfter finding this I have found many answers on this website containing similar info so I thought this would be a good place to ask but anyway...followed those instructions all the way through to the point where it says \"If you are not able to see your wifi networks, follow the steps below\" but if anything when I got to that point the wifi was even worse than before so i mentioned it to the author and he just said to continue all of the steps so stupidly I did and now I get no wifi connection at all although I can see access points but even when I boot into windows I cant even get a wifi connection there!

If you so chose, you could perform the downloading and verification yourself as well (in which case you can download and save to whatever filename you want).\nFor now:\nfilename=$(apt-get download libopencv-dev --print-uris | awk '{print $2}')\n\n\nA: Here is a script named downloadthis.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in $(apt-cache show $1 | grep Version | sed 's/^Version..//g')\n do apt-get download $1\n dpkg-deb -x \"$1\"*\"$i\"*deb $2\n done\n\nDon't forget to make it executable.\nHere is an example of use:\n./downloadthis libopencv-dev\n\nThe script will create a directory named libopencv-dev in your home directory. You can edit the script and change ~/$1 to another path (like /my/path for example).\nAlternatively, you could edit the script and change ~/$1 to ~/$2 to allow you to specify the extract directory when you run the script.\nHere is an example of this use:\n./downloadthis libopencv-dev /my/path\n\n\nA: Make the script:\nPACKAGE=packagename\napt-get download $PACKAGE\ndpkg-deb -x $PACKAGE*.deb /my/path\n\nThis should work for all packages. It may or may not work in PPA's or external repositories.\n", "Q: Disable secure boot y/n? I have windows 10 installed. Im trying to install ubuntu. Should i turn off secure boot or leave it on? What does it do? \n\nA: Yes and No\nOn the most basic level, UEFI Secure Boot prevents running unsigned boot loaders.\nModern versions of Ubuntu will boot and install normally on most PCs with Secure Boot enabled.\nBut not all available tools and OS are having signed boot loaders. If you enable Secure boot and try to boot from say Hirans Boot CD, or If you manually add Grub Entries, you might get something like this :\n\nBut if you wish to use only Ubuntu and Windows , as both are having valid and signed boot loaders, you can keep Secure boot ON.\n\nA: Secure Boot prevents from booting unsigned operational systems.\nIt allows to boot only systems that are signed with a key that is stored in UEFI.\nUbuntu kernels are signed and you can install Ubuntu with Secure Boot enabled, but there are some limitations if you use Secure Boot:\n\n*\n\n*You will not be able to install some 3rd party kernel modules (proprietary graphics and wireless drivers, any other custom built modules) that are not signed.\n\n\n*Hibernation will not work.\nGenerally Secure Boot is not a very useful feature, because nowadays boot viruses are not an issue. Linux systems have other ways of protection from installing malware (root permissions).\nThe bottom line is that if you need unsigned modules, you do not lose much if you disable Secure Boot.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on eMMC storage I'm experiencing a problem installing Ubuntu on my new laptop.\nIt originally had windows 10 Home version, but I wiped out the disk (eMMC) and tried to install the Ubuntu.

Unfortunately, after installing and restarting it immediately boots to a black screen. \nHardware specs are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: A4 3300m\n\n*GPU: Radeon HD 6480G (APU)\n\n*RAM: 4GB\nNote that I have had the same problem on multiple distributions of Ubuntu starting as far back as 14.04 and on every flavor of Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Ubuntu, even Mint). \nOn those previous installations I added nomodeset to my grub commands, and then installed fglrx which actually fixed the problem (despite suggestions to fix the problem saying that fglrx should be uninstalled). Now, however, fglrx is no longer supported on Ubuntu 16.04 so this method doesn't work.\nMy understanding is that it is a bug with the open source driver, but this seems unlikely since I've not seen any bug reports on it, and this issue has been around for at least 2 years.\nAny ideas on what I can do?\n\nA: I've figured out how to fix it! \nInstead of \"nomodeset\" in the grub options, I put \"acpi_osi=Linux\", and it booted normally with open-source Radeon drivers.\n\nA: I had to remove \"quiet\" and \"splash\", and add \"nomodeset\".  I hope this helps you.\n\nA: I recently did a fresh install of Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 LTS on a Dell 7010  with a Dell 20\" P2012H LCD Monitor and had a similar problem.

I set the monitor to use the display port input instead of the auto-detect option and the problem went away.\n", "Q: Multiple IP addresses with bonded interfaces I have a server with two ethernet ports and I have bonded them together with the following config in /etc/network/interfaces:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nauto bond0\niface bond0 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.300\ngateway 192.168.0.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\nbond-mode balance-rr\nbond-miimon 100\nbond-slaves eth0 eth1\n\nSo currently, all connections are routed through bond0. I need another interface such as bond1 that can operate on a separate IP address such as 192.168.0.301.\nI know that in order to achieve this with just the eth0 interface, I need to append:\nauto eth0:0\niface eth0:0 inet static\n(and so on)\n\nbut how would I go about this with a network bond? Something along the lines of bond0:0 and bond0:1 maybe? Or bond0 and bond1 but create 4 total network interfaces such as: eth0:0 eth1:0 and eth0:1 and eth1:1 and use them as the respective slaves for the two separate bonds? Kinda confusing, but any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: As I had this issue myself and there is little information on it anywhere, so here is the \"correct\" solution for the /etc/network/interfaces file:\nauto bond0\niface bond0 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.5\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.0.1\n    bond-mode 802.3ad\n    bond-miimon 100\n    bond-updelay 200\n    bond-downdelay 200\n    bond-lacp-rate 1\n    bond-slaves eth0 eth1\n\nauto bond0:1\niface bond0:1 inet static\n    address 192.168.10.160\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nIt works almost the same as with regular interfaces like eth0, but you must not repeat the bond configuration - that should only be in the bond0 configuration. You can then add as many additional IP addresses as needed like this, as bond0:2, bond0:3, etc.\nIf you also want to add IPv6 addresses, it is a little different again, as you need to add this (as an example):\niface bond0 inet6 static\n    address 2eee:354:3a3::745\n    netmask 64\n    gateway 2eee:354:3a3::1\n\nIPv6 does not need bond0:1 or similar workarounds - just use bond0 for every address. It uses the bond settings from the IPv4 address, like a second IPv4 address. And you do not need to repeat the gateway part for additional IPv6 addresses, just use address and netmask for the second IPv6 address.\nAfter you changed the interfaces file, you should execute the following commands to fully restart networking and load these changes:\nip address flush eth0\nip address flush eth1\nsystemctl restart networking\n\nThis removes all IP addresses from eth0 and eth1 and then restarts networking with the new configuration. Make sure you are logged in locally to the machine, as you need to completely turn of networking before restarting it, so all connections will be lost.\n\nA: I am using a setup you want but on CentOS. I believe you can figure it out how to translate it to ubuntu config if I just show you how it works in CentOS. My setup is like this:\nifcfg-eth4\nDEVICE=eth4\nBOOTPROTO=none\nHWADDR=00:0F:FE:E4:A4:CF\nONBOOT=yes\nHOTPLUG=no\nSLAVE=yes\nMASTER=bond2\n\nifcfg-bond2\nDEVICE=bond2\nBOOTPROTO=none\nIPADDR=192.168.20.1\nNETMASK=255.255.0.0\nONBOOT=yes\nTYPE=bonding\nMASTER=yes\nBONDING_OPTS=\"miimon=100 mode=1\" \n\nifcfg-bond2:1\nDEVICE=bond2:1\nBOOTPROTO=none\nIPADDR=192.168.41.1\nNETMASK=255.255.0.0\nONBOOT=yes\nTYPE=bonding\nMASTER=yes\nBONDING_OPTS=\"miimon=100 mode=1\" \n\nSo I would try it that way in your case:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nauto bond0\niface bond0 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.300\ngateway 192.168.0.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\nbond-mode balance-rr\nbond-miimon 100\nbond-slaves eth0 eth1\n\nauto bond0:1\niface bond0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.300\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\nbond-mode balance-rr\nbond-miimon 100\nbond-slaves eth0 eth1\n\nTry it out.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Black Screen After Suspend I've seen this issue reported but have not seen a solution working for me.

This laptop went through a lot and I want to replace it for the same model with slightly better configuration (and better condition of course) - core i7 2620M, 8GB ram, ssd 160GB.\nQuestion is, can I simply take my old ssd drive and place it in new laptop? Or will it cause issues with ubuntu, etc.\n\nA: The simple move of ssd will not allow the system to access the operating system present in the disk. You will need to configure the boot partition to the one which is present in the ssd. Else the system will not find the booting operating system. \nWhen moving:\nWhen moving you have to take care of hardware dependencies.  However most users won't encounter any difficulty other than xorg.conf (and even then modern distributions tend not to need it) and perhaps the bootloader.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the disk configuration is different, you may need to reconfigure\nthe bootloader and filesystem tables (/etc/fstab, /etc/crypttab if\nyou use cryptography, /etc/mdadm.conf if you use md RAID). For the\nbootloader, the easiest way is to pop the disk into the new machine,\nboot your distribution's live CD/USB and use its bootloader\nreparation tool.\n\n\nNote that if you're copying the data rather than physically moving the disk (for example because one or both systems dual boot with Windows), it's faster and easier to copy whole partitions (with (G)Parted or dd).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have an xorg.conf file to declare display-related options\n(e.g. in relation with a proprietary driver), it will need to be\nmodified if the target system has a different graphics card or a\ndifferent monitor setup. You should also install the proprietary\ndriver for the target system's graphics card before moving, if\napplicable.\n\n*If you've declared module options or blacklists in /etc/modprobe.d,\nthey may need to be adjusted for the target system.\n\n\nCloning:\nCloning an installation involves the same hardware-related issues as moving, but there are a few more things to take care of to give the new machine a new identity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/hostname to give the new machine a new name. Search for\nother occurrences of the host name under /etc. Common locations are\n/etc/hosts (alias for 127.0.0.1) and /etc/mailname or other mail\nsystem configuration.\n\n*Regenerate the ssh host key.\n\n*Make any necessary change to the networking configuration (such as a\nstatic IP address).\n\n*Change the UUID of RAID volumes (not necessary, but recommended to\navoid confusion), e.g., mdadm -U uuid.\n\n", "Q: How to add the text before the line in whole file? I have list of domain in text file and I need to add 127.0.0.1 ip before the line in whole file.

Let's say I want to add '127.0.0.1 ' to the beginning of all lines in this text file.\n\n\n\n\n*Using search and replace feature, search for \\n and replace it with \\n127.0.0.1  then click Replace all button as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n*This is your result:\nDisclaimer: You will have to manually enter the replace with text 127.0.0.1  at the beginning of the first line.\n\n\n\nA: You can achieve that with sed in the following way:\nsed -i 's/^/127.0.0.1 /' /path/filename.txt\n\nBest make a backup of the file before, I'm right now not sure if you need to escape the space or not. To make a backup directly when you run sed you can use the following line:\nsed -i_bak -e 's/^/127.0.0.1 /' /path/filename.txt\n\nA bit more information about sed you can find here.\n\nA: awk is a good option to this issue. Explaining in two examples:\n# Let's consider a file domain.txt with lines like this:\n# <domain> <user> <user> ....\n# Ex: domain.zzz.yy user01 user02\n\n# Extracting the first field of each line\nawk '{ print \"127.0.0.1 \" $1;}' domain.txt\n\n# produces: 127.0.0.1 domain.zzz.yy\n# filter only first field $1=domain.zzz.yy\n# $1: first field, $2: second field, and so on\n\n# Extracting the whole line\nawk '{ print \"127.0.0.1 \" $0;}' domain.txt\n\n# produce: 127.0.0.1 domain.zzz.yy user01 user02\n# $0: whole line\n\n\nA: Easy way to add before :\n$ printf \"127.0.0.1 %s\\n\" $(cat domain.txt)\n\n\n%s means string of line on file\n\\n means prints the content in new line\n\n", "Q: Urdu language not listed in my ubuntu 16.04 LTS I am a new user of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Probably that's the explanation why you don't find Urdu.\nYou may want to install the fonts-nafees package to render Urdu web contents.\nsudo apt install fonts-nafees\n\nPossibly you may also want to contact the Urdu translators team and help improve the translation status, so the Urdu language packs can again be included in the distribution.

It is built over the frame buffer and input event devices, internally, and presents itself to application-mode systems as a series of kernel virtual terminal devices, /dev/tty1 and so forth.  Strictly speaking this is not necessarily your console, which could be a serial terminal device.  But let's skip over that, because answering for that would involve knowing what terminal hardware was at the other end of the serial link.\nThe terminal emulator program that is built into the Linux kernel does not support input methods.\nSo to have a non-X11 terminal with input methods you need to run a user-space virtual terminal that uses the frame buffer and input event devices.  They disconnect the in-kernel terminal emulator from those devices, whilst they themselves are using them.\nUser-space virtual terminal emulators that support input methods include\n\n\n*\n\n*zhcon (Ubuntu package)\n\n*fbterm (Ubuntu package) and its forks such as jfbterm (Ubuntu package)\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/177209/5132\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/194218/5132\n\nA: \nTo login with normal name.\n\nTo login with root.\nTo delete the three lines in /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc  and /root/.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx\nexport QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx\nexport XMODIFIERS=\"@im=fcitx\"\n\nvim /etc/X11/Xsession.d/25xchinput\nexport LAGN=zh_CN.utf8\nexport LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.utf8\nexport XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx\nfcitx & \n\n", "Q: how to install rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch.rpm on ubuntu system I tried to install rpmrebuild using the below command :\nrpm -ivh rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch.rpm.\nBut fails with the below errors:\nerror: \nFailed dependencies:\n        /bin/bash is needed by rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch\n        /bin/sh is needed by rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch\n        rpm-build is needed by rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch\n        textutils is needed by rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch\n\n\nA: besides the question whether it is a good idea to install rpms on a debian-based os (like ubuntu); rpm does not manage dependencies; in the same way dpkg won't do that for you either. So you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*search online and make sure you download the rpms that are needed (in this case bash*.rpm, rpm-build*.rpm, coreutils*.rpm and maybe others; then when installing you need to specify them all at once on the command line: rpm -ivh rpmrebuild-2.11-3.el7.noarch.rpm bash*.rpm rpm-build*.rpm\ncoreutils*.rpm\n\n*use a package manager; like zypper or yum which uses repositories where it looks for the required packages for you and installs them.

You are then on the hook for installing them yourself.  /bin/bash and /bin/sh should already be in place (although on Ubuntu /bin/sh pointing to dash might cause problems).

Ctrl-Alt-F1 does not bring me to a terminal.\nI tried a bit everything in recovery mode (fsck, grub, fix packages, etc.) to no avail. Things were complicated by the fact I couldn't get the wifi to work in the recovery shell (dhclient wlan0 never returns), so I had to plug in a network cable to run apt-get upgrade and such.\nI burned a CD with the 16.04 ISO. I started with it, it gave me an option to reinstall Ubuntu on top of my install. Did that, it gave me one error about one of my package that it couldn't reinstall, to do it manually afterwards. Upon restart, I go straight into emergency mode. The last message tells me that ISO-8859-1 is not supported on /dev/sda1, my boot partition. Running depmod tells me that /etc/modules/4.4.0.22 does not exist. Yes, only 4.4.0.21 exists.\nSo if I start the standard ubuntu it tries the 4.4.0.22 kernel and doesn't find the modules, so goes straight to emergency mode. If I go through the advanced grub menu and choose 4.4.0.21, I go back to the black screen I had this morning. A day lost and nothing accomplished... Things were working fine yesterday, and the laptop shut down correctly last night.\nThanks for any pointer.\n\nA: OK, poring over the log I saw a GTK error. I had installed manually GTK 3.20, I was sure I had restarted since but apparently not. Uninstalling GTK 3.20 to go back to 3.18 solved my issue. Thanks to everybody who chimed in with suggestions.\n\nA: To fix your kernel troubles with missing modules, you can try to install the 4.4.0.22 linux image:\napt install linux-image-4.4.0-22-generic\n\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't update anymore I have recently noticed that I can't install new versions.

I have referred many stack overflow questions related to this and the one that I found closest, perhaps the exact was this one, the difference only being that problem started after I suspended my pc and then woke it up. I tried rebooting my pc, followed some steps in other Stack Overflow answers, but the problem still persists. It fails to show wlan0. However, I am able to connect to my network via ethernet. I have a Dell 5558 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 pre-installed. Reading the comments in the above referenced link, is it an internal problem or can I rectify it using software?

It is probably disabled in BIOS.\nResetting BIOS to default may solve the problem. \n", "Q: unrecognized service when starting ssh I'm trying to connect to a remote Ubuntu computer at work via SSH from my laptop running Ubuntu.\nAt first, I just tried running:\n$ ssh work_name@work_machine\n\nBut nothing happened.\nSearching for a tutorial on the net, I followed the instructions on this page\nI suppose I need to activate the possibility for such a connection, so I typed in the terminal on my laptop\nsudo service ssh start\n\nAfter typing my password, I received the following message:\nssh: unrecognized service.\n\nI wish someone could help me understand what should be done for the SSH remote connection to work.\n\nA: I'm assuming that you've already configured port forwarding and are able to get through to the machine at work.\nOtherwise, even after following my answer, you won't get very far.\n\nThe SSH server is not installed by default.\nYou will need to install it by running these commands in a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) on the machine you wish to connect to:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nThen you will be able to connect normally by running:\n#Replace user & IP accordingly\nssh user@192.168.3.321\n\n\nHowever, in that state you have a security risk.\nAs Oli has noted here,\n\nYou need to harden it from the standard setup. I've gone through\n  several suggestions on my blog but at the very least, I'd suggest:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Key-based logins. Disable password logins.\n  \n*Move it off port 22. Use something crazy-high, in the 20000-60000 range.\n  \n*Use fail2ban to ban people who do find it and try to brute it.\n  \n  \n  They take about 10 minutes in total and you go from a 1/10000 chance\n  of being broken in to a probability so small, there isn't enough paper\n  in the world to write its fraction...

So in short, my public key and private key are the same.\nAnother peculiar scenario is that here three lines start with ABCDE, but the combination has to be different.\nHow can I get separate public and private keys?\n\nA: \nI know that the portion after pub ABCDE/ is the public key and the portion after sec ABCDE/ is the private key.\n\nYou're mistaking the algorithm identification field with the key ID.\nsec   ABCDE/XXXXXXXL 2016-06-09\nuid                  My Name (comment) <example@email.com>\nsub   ABCDE/XXXXXXXM 2016-06-09\nsub   ABCDE/XXXXXXXN 2016-06-10\n\nThe field you've been hiding through ABCDE can never be ABCDE. This field holds the algorithm and key size identifier, for example R4096 for a 4096 bit RSA key. It is expected to hold the same information for the same algorithm and key size. D1024 denotes a 1024 bit DSA key, et cetera.\nThe (short) key ID is the part behind the slash / -- and looking at question, it already seems to be different, anyway.\n\nHow can I get separate public and private keys?\n\nYou already have. Three pairs of public/private keys have been generated, each of them being unique. There is no such like a private key id, in OpenPGP you always reference the public key (as keys always come in pairs, anyway).\n\nA: Finally I managed to solve my problem. Although in a different way.\nI installed thunderbird, created an account for my email address. Next I installed enigmail extention. From enigmail setup wizard I created key-pair for my acoount and a revocation certificate.\nBut here problem was still not gone. I went to enigmail key management then right clicked on my key and selected upload to public key server. But constant error was coming. It was because enigmail was unable to add the keys to my trusted keyring.\nSo I once again right clicked on my key and selected export key and then enabled export of private key and clicked OK. Let us assume that I had given the name to the output file mykey-pub-sec.asc\nNext I went to the terminal and typed:\ncd /path/to/the/saved/file\ngpg --allow-secret-key-import --import mykey-pub-sec.asc\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key $GPGKEY\n\nHere I replaced $GPGKEY with the key ID\nThat's it job done\n", "Q: ubuntu 16.04 LiveCD/Intall no video output Installing Ubuntu 16.04 from USB drive on a fresh build PC with a new Nvidia GTX 1080 card.\nI get the initial menu options (try Ubuntu, install etc) but after selecting Try I get a black screen (monitor reports invalid DVI signal)\nI've tried selecting the nomodeset  option and still get the same.\nAny other workarounds known ?

Before that, I was running XP, but them rendered half of my RAM-memory useless (4 out of 8 GB), so I thought it wise to upgrade to 7.\nAnyway, no installation cd is available and no external storage device either, apart from a 16GB usb-stick, that I have been running UbuntuStudio live from during the last week, which right now is the only working OS I've got. Booting any mode of my old Windows installation seems impossible, and whatever I do while trying to boot from my internal ssd, I end up like this: \ngrub> _\nNote that I have never installed any version of Linux on this computer.\nUnless someone can recommend a workaround, I think I'll have to format my drive, and I reckon I'd better do it the proper way: this advice sounds... sound.\nOnly that when I type sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass <password> /dev/sda, Terminal returns bash: password: No such file or directory, password being my chosen password.\nSo, what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Unless you need to destroy the data on the hard disk (to make it irrecoverable by data recovery software), you don't need to secure erase; simply formatting the drive should be adequate.\nThat said, when you type the command, be sure to replace the entire <password> phrase, including < and > characters.

Until then, security will only appear as enabled.\nWhether trying the very user-password you just set, or other variants, such as \"\", \"NULL\", NULL or a row of 32 spaces, either as a user-password or as a master-password, will not unlock your drive, but instead give you an Input/output error.\nsudo hdparm --user-master m --security-erase \"\" /dev/sda\n\nwill, however, do the job (that's m as in master, since in Kingston's case the master-password is apparently NULL by default).\nThe very same master password (\"\") that returns the Input/output error for the security-unlock command, works just fine with the security-erase command.\nSo don't lock your ssd unless you really intend to erase it, 'cause it's far from certain whether you'll be able to unlock it.\nI've been reading reports of similar issues and I've even stumbled across a patch, which I have, however, not tested.\n\nA: The --security-erase option presumes a drive that has already been locked with that password.  I infer from your previous question that you just want a secure destruction of everything on the disk.  This is how I do that:\nsudo su - \ncat /dev/urandom > /dev/sda\n\nNow wait (quite) a while for the \"out of space\" error.  Disk sda is wiped, and very securely at that.\nIf you are in a hurry and aren't paranoid,\ncat /dev/zero > /dev/sda\n\nwill work just as well (really) and be many times faster.\nOptionally, run fdisk /dev/sda next and use the n command to add a new partition, accepting all the defaults to create a single big partition.  But even if you skip this step, any OS install you do next will create the partition for you.\n", "Q: Skype audio not working in 16.04 OS: Kubuntu 16.04\nDesktop Environment:KDE 5.6.4\nIssue: Skype microphone not working\nSkype settings screenshot:\n\nPulseAudio Screen screenshot:\n\nPackages installed:\nabhishek  $ dpkg -l |grep pulse\nii  gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio:amd64                   1.8.1-1ubuntu0.1                                  amd64        GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio\nii  libpulse-mainloop-glib0:amd64                   1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        PulseAudio client libraries (glib support)\nii  libpulse0:amd64                                 1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        PulseAudio client libraries\nii  libpulse0:i386                                  1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    i386         PulseAudio client libraries\nii  libpulsedsp:amd64                               1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        PulseAudio OSS pre-load library\nii  pulseaudio                                      1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        PulseAudio sound server\nii  pulseaudio-equalizer                            2.7.0.2-5~webupd8~xenial0                         all          PulseAudio Equalizer - LADSPA plugin graphical user interface\nii  pulseaudio-module-x11                           1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        X11 module for PulseAudio sound server\nii  pulseaudio-utils                                1:8.0-0ubuntu3                                    amd64        Command line tools for the PulseAudio sound server\nabhishek  $ dpkg -l |grep alsa\nii  alsa-base                                       1.0.25+dfsg-0ubuntu5                              all          ALSA driver configuration files\nii  alsa-utils                                      1.1.0-0ubuntu5                                    amd64        Utilities for configuring and using ALSA\nii  gstreamer1.0-alsa:amd64                         1.8.1-1ubuntu0.1                                  amd64        GStreamer plugin for ALSA\n\nI have tried numerous solutions online, installing various packages but none has worked.\nOther things to note:\nI hear audio in skype.\n\nA: Setting in Pulse Audio Volume Control:\nOpen Pulse Audio Volume Control > Configuration tab > Built-in Audio - Profile: Analog Stereo Duplex\n\nA: This does not seem to be directly related, but I had success by installing the skypeforlinux-64.deb file that can be downloaded from https://skype.com.\nThe snap version of skype didn't work correctly.

In the partitioning step I had it install grub to the external HDD, not my internal Windows 10 HDD. But when I rebooted the computer, it boots to a grub command line.\nIn side the UEFI, there is still a Window Boot Manger option, plus 2 Ubuntu boot options. I can still boot to Win10 through the WBM, but the 2 Ubuntu options do nothing.\nHow can I remove all traces of Grub and the 2 Ubuntu boot options from the Win10 HDD?\n\nA: It sounds like GRUB is broken.\nTry booting into the live CD again, open a terminal and type sudo update-grub.\nThis should fix GRUB. Then the Ubuntu boot option in UEFI should go to GRUB which should let you choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\nI don't think that removing all traces of GRUB from your hard drive will solve your problems, unless you don't want Ubuntu anymore. WBM does  not support Ubuntu but GRUB does support Windows, so it is preferable.\n\nA: Ok I followed https://askubuntu.com/a/240831/440238 and deleted the Ubuntu boot stuff from Win10's efi partition.

I recently received a notification after the latest updates (Ubuntu 14.04.4) that I am running out of space on my root folder. I performed sudo apt-get cleanbut the space freed doesn't seem to be enough (1.5 GB free). Therefore I am looking to add another 50 GB to my / folder.

If not, is/are there (an) alternative(s) to what has been suggested here?\n\nA: In your case, you will have to shift all the partitions that are located to the left of your root partition to the left, to in the end create a 50 GB space at the left of your root partition. You cannot bridge two partitions if you are asking that.\nMind you that this will take a long time, and may result in data loss if the operation is interrupted.\nPlease backup this data if possible.\nBest of Luck to you!!!\n", "Q: Remap power button on mouse (using X) There is a button on my mouse which hibernates my system and I want to map it to do nothing. This button was originally mapped to do something else in Windows using the Windows software that came with the mouse, but that software is not available for Ubuntu. I don't know why it is now mapped to the power button.\nI have been trying to use xinput to remap buttons but the button in question does not show up in xinput get-button-map <device id> so I don't know how to change it.

But I would have expected to see 124 somewhere which I do not see. This is what is confusing me because now I cannot remap it to 0\nRunning xmodmap -pk shows (among other things):\n    124     0x1008ff2a (XF86PowerOff)   0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0x1008ff2a (XF86PowerOff)   \n\nso it makes sense that 124 is the power button.

I have also tried typing xev and then pressing this key but there is no output.\nI am new to X and so I don't really know what I am doing. I have googled a lot and the idea of using xinput or xmodmap came from my googling.\nAny help appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: I hope this helps: https://askubuntu.com/a/492745\nI would suggest using xinput test and simply pressing the buttons you want to change. Once you know the actual button ID you can remap it temporarily with xinput on the CLI, or permanently by writing a custom ~/.xsessionrc as shown in the above answer.\n", "Q: How to disable/prevent standard user from accessing the appearance setting in 16.04 LTS I have 50 plus PC running with Ubuntu 14.04 and I am planning to upgrade it to 16.04. How can I disable or prevent standard user from accessing or changing the wallpaper, icons, etc.. \nAny help please?\n\nA: First of: why? They can't do any harm with it and you might think it is easy but you are forgetting a couple of things.\nYou do it like this ...\nsudo chmod 700 /usr/bin/unity-control-center\n\nThis will prevent users to change any settings provided by the graphical interface but ... this will not prevent them from using command-line or a TTY. If they know how to use gsettings they can still alter any of these options. So you probably also want to prevent them from using gsettings. And a can of worms opens :)\nNow for a better method:\nWhy not reset these settings you do not want them to alter on every boot? Just create a script with the gsettings in  it. \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///dir/dir/dir/wallpaper.png\n\nwill change the wallpaper. Similar to that you can create lines for other options. Execute the script somewhere, and make the script non-mutable for normal users. This works if you only want a few settings.\nIf you really want to reset all settings: create a script to read all current settings and reload those settings when the system is booted.\n--\nEasier method:\ncd ~/.config/dconf/ \n~/.config/dconf$ ls  \nuser\n~/.config/dconf$ file user\nuser: GVariant Database file, version 0\n\n... copy this file and restore it during a boot.\n", "Q: Which package has oowriter? I cannot find it in apt-get. I need it for converting .odt documents into PDF; would be great for .doc/.docx too\ncd /path/to/directory\noowriter -pt PDF ./*.odt\n\nSystems: Ubuntu 16.04  \n\nA: oowriter is open office writer. Open Office is a 3rd party application (and that explains why you can not find it).\nWhat you want is lowriter. Libre office is installed by default and that is the equivalent of oowriter.\n\nBy the way: you should have seen a warning when you use oowriter:\n$ oowriter -pt PDF ./*.odt\nNo command 'oowriter' found, did you mean:\n Command 'lowriter' from package 'libreoffice-writer' (main)\noowriter: command not found\n\n\nA: Do \nsoffice --headless --convert-to pdf *\n\nwhere using the application without a interface (-headless) and internally lowriter -pt PDF *.odt, which prints (-pt) to PDF all .odt files as proposed by Rinzwind\n\nlibreoffice is a shell script that sets up the environment and passes the command line arguments to the soffice.bin binary.\n\nIts manual at man lowriter. \n\nA: You can open .odt files with many programs: OpenOffice (obviously), LibreOffice, Calligra Office,AbiWord (from Gnome Office),Scribus, WPS Office, or online, with Zoho Docs, Google Docs (this one actually open it by convertion-on-the-fly to GDocs filetype). \nodt=open document text. It is the native text file format of OpenOffice (and LibreOffice).  \nFor best results, it would be wise to check file properties, see what program produced that file and open it with the same program. Many programs,even Microsoft Office, opens odt files by importing or converting it to proprietary formats. This action is lossy in most cases, in doesn't lose the text, but misinterprets some formats and pagination. Graphical elements interpretation ( like equations, charts, vector graphics) is a major concern.\n", "Q: Facing problem while running eclipse,is the desktop entry correct? I have created a desktop entry for running eclipse .  \n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Name=Eclipse 4\n    Type=Application\n    Exec=/home/shubhendu/eclipse/eclipse/eclipse\n    Terminal=false\n    Icon=/home/shubhendu/eclipse/eclipse/icon.xpm\n    Comment=Integrated Development Environment\n    NoDisplay=false\n    Categories=Development;IDE;\n    Name[en]=Eclipse\n\nThe eclipse opens but as soon as I select a project , it closes immediately.\n\nA: As the application starts from the desktop entry you created, there is no issue with the desktop entry. This has to do something with the application itself. Try changing the Terminal=false to Terminal=true so that you can see the logs when Eclipse shuts down. You might be able to pinpoint the exact cause there.\n", "Q: What is the right-click menu? Sorry if this is a basic question, but I am new to Ubuntu. I am receiving an error in the top bar saying, \"An error occurred, please run Package Manager from the right-click menu or...\"\nI don't know where the right-click menu is.\n\nA: Click the sign that looks like a do not enter sign. This is what's called the right-click menu (for the package manager). If you look in the list of items and messages, there should be a Package Manager link.\nI've had this problem before and opening the package manager won't do a lot to fix it but it can help.\nIf you still get the message after opening the package manager, open a terminal and enter the following commands (these worked for me):\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis will (as any command where you use sudo) ask for your password.\nEnter it and press enter.\nNext, enter:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nThis probably will fix the problem. It happens quite a lot when updates get stuck.\n\nA: This is happening because you have a corrupt entry in your repository. In order to fix this follow the below instructions.\n1)Open the terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T\n2) type: sudo apt-get check\nThis checks for broken repositories.\n3) type: sudo apt-get update\nThis updates the repository file after the above fix. \nYou may need to restart the computer after doing this for the error to disappear, but it should fix the issue. Any problems, let me know. :)\n\nA: The fix is very simple. Open the terminal and run the command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and then restart your computer.\n\nA: Another good solution is to restart your computer which would usually fix the problem. It gives an opportunity for your repository list to refresh. Try it and say how it goes.\n", "Q: Unsure of grep output because of bash wildcards I am trying to get a better understanding of bash commands. \nls /usr/include/ | grep \\.h\n\nIt is supposed to list all the files ending in .h (C libraries) but it outputs more than expected.\nthread_db .h\nuchar .h\nnetash\nIf someone could also tell me how to bold the .h in the question without separating it from the rest of the name with a space, i would appriciate it.\n\nA: In grep, your pattern is matching .h (any character followed by h) anywhere in the line, not just at the end.\nYou basically have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quoting/escaping issue\n\n*Regex pattern issue\nExplanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have escaped . using \\. and have not used any quotes or another \\, so the escaping would escape the shell, and grep would get the Regex pattern as .h, in Regex term which means any character followed by a h. Your target is to make grep treat the . literal, so you need to quote or add another \\ like:\n'\\.h'\n\\\\.h\n\n\n*Now the second problem, in regex, the end of a line is expressed by the quantifier $, so as you need to match the .h at the end of the line:\n'\\.h$'\n\nSo, together the correct usage would be:\nls /usr/include/ | grep '\\.h$'\n\n\nNow the most important thing, Don't parse ls.\nWhat you are doing can be easily and efficiently done by basic shell globbing:\nls /usr/include/*.h\n\n", "Q: Installing GATE on my computer I'm trying to installe a program called GATE on my computer (Ubuntu 12.04).  When downloaded I get a .jar file, but there install instructions seem unclear to me.  Can anyone lend me hand in getting this to work.  I have Java 8 installed already and am using Eclipse.\n\nA: Anytime you have a .jar with JDK present in your system, you can run it as java -jar <jarfile>.jar. This is independent of the OS you are using.\n", "Q: Icon eclipse wrong I created an item to start the eclipse, but does not show the eclipse icon. How can I solve?\nMy sistem is: Ubuntu-mate 16.04\n\n\n\nA: You need to add the Eclipse icon to the launcher you created, manually.\nTo do this, open the menu editor (shown in your second screenshot), right click on the \"Eclipse\" item you created, and select \"Properties\". This will give you a dialog box like this:\n\nClick on the button with the spring / launcher icon, which will open a file chooser to pick an icon (image file). There's probably one included with the eclipse package / distribution you downloaded, if not, you can find one on Google images, save it, and use that.\n", "Q: Thinkpad 440p Trackpad: several problems I recently installed Kubuntu for the first time on my Thinkpad 440 and there are three issues I'm having with the trackpad:\n1) Size of the middle click zone\nOn Windows, there was a fairly large region I could press and have it be registered as a middle click.

I like to run the development releases of Ubuntu (alpha, beta, whatever).\nIs there any reason why I shouldn't enable proposed updates for Ubuntu before Ubuntu is released as stable?\nAre proposed updates different after a stable Ubuntu release?\n\n\nA: \n\"There is very little benefit to users in using -proposed during the development cycle and such use is strongly discouraged.\"1\n\nAfter a new stable release of Ubuntu, testers are encouraged to use the -proposed repository to test Stable Release Updates to help the Release Team decide whether the update should be released to all users. However, during the development cycle, -proposed works differently and the Ubuntu Developers do not recommend enabling -proposed.\nDuring Ubuntu's development cycle, all package updates are first uploaded to the proposed repository. Once the package completes a few basic checks, it is uploaded to the regular repository.\nThe basic checks include\n\n\n*\n\n*Completion of the build on all supported architectures\n\n*Completion of any library transitions (libfoo2 > libfoo3)\n\n*Successful passing of any other automated testing\n\n\nFor many packages, this process can be completed in an hour or two.\nIf a user has enabled -proposed, they could experience issues with broken packages that have failed some of those basic checks. Generally, it is unnecessary to file a bug about the issue as Ubuntu Developers regularly track which packages fail one of those basic checks.\nTo summarize, enabling proposed during the development cycle means you have a greater risk of running buggy software and are not really improving the quality of Ubuntu much.\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Wiki: ProposedMigration\n\n*Original ubuntu-devel mailing list post by Colin Watson\n\nA: For development releases proposed does not make any sense to turn on.\nIt is used for automated package testing.\nBut for stable releases you can enable proposed if you want to test unstable packages and report bugs to launchpad. I see no other reason to enable it.\nA better way to use proposed is not to turn it on permanently, but install selected packages that you want to test at the moment.\n", "Q: Why is LibreOffice so slow when used in Ubuntu 16.04? The Problem\nI'm using LibreOffice 5.0.6.3 in Ubuntu 16.04, and the program is considerably slower than in e.g. Windows 8.1 and Debian 8.\nThis shows up in particular when I change the zoom level in larger documents below 200%.\nAbove 200% (e.g. from 200% to 220% etc.), zooming in and out happens absolutely smooth -- the program needs no time for the change.\nBut e.g. from 160% to 180%, zooming causes the program to get extremely laggy: Everything freezes, and sometimes also the whole program surface turns grey/black -- sometimes for some seconds, sometimes \"permanently\".\nThis does not happen when the edited document is relativley small; that is, when there are no objects, images etc. in it, but only text, or when the document is only a few pages long.\nExample\nI have an extensive document (50+ pages) with many arrows, tables, and also some pictures, and the problems mentioned occur when I open it in Ubuntu 16.04. But they don't occur when I edit the same document in Debian 8 and Windows 8.1.\nWhat I've tried already\nI already changed certain properties, since I searched quite a bit for possible solutions.\nFor example, I turned off Java and Open CL, and provided considerably more memory for LibreOffice.\nBut all of this improved the situation hardly noticeably -- if at all...\n...which is not really surprising, since in Windows 8.1 and Debian, LO ran smoothly without making these changes.\nQuestion\nDoes anyone know whether this is an Ubuntu-specific problem, or simply why that occurs?\nCould it have something to do with the fact that I'm not using the pre-installed version from Ubuntu Xenial?\n(I switched to the above mentioned version, since 5.1.x seemed to be even more unstable than 5.0.5 already was. (sudden crashes after simple commands))\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, to make LibreOffice Impress 5.1.4.2 fast just remove the libreoffice-gtk package. Don't remove the libreoffice-gnome package, which is necessary for the UI to look good and be properly integrated with gnome (e.g. expected integrated open file dialog). So:\n$ sudo apt-get remove libreoffice-gtk\n\nNow copy-pasting slides is fast again, and scrolling the slides as well.\n\nA: The problem seems to be caused by bugs related to the GTK3 builds of LibreOffice (look here and here). As fare as I found out, the only way to work around is to switch back to the GTK2 version. At first you have to be sure the related packages are installed:\nsudo apt install libreoffice-gtk libreoffice-gtk2\n\nThen you can start LibreOffice with GTK2 temporarily with:\nSAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gtk SAL_SYNCHRONIZE=1 libreoffice\n\nNow it should work again normally. If it does, you can remove the GTK3 package to force LibreOffice to use the GTK2 version permanently:\nsudo apt purge libreoffice-gtk3\n\nShame on Canonical to deliver an untested version of LibreOffice!\n\nA: To avoid slow User Interface update, a workaround is to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove packages: libreoffice-gnome and libreoffice-gtk and\nlibreoffice-gtk3. \n\n*Restart (Close and Open) LibreOffice.\n\n\nAfter this, LibreOffice User Interface is being updated fast.

I applied a Fade effect to a video clip using Kdenlive.

Here's a screenshot:\n\nMake sure you have \"Effect stack\" checked in the \"View\" menu for this to work. I hope I understand your question right, let me know if you haven't and this is not what you want to do. \n\nA: I place the cursor (via left click on mouse) over the actual \"fade\" symbol between the clips, click the cursor and the symbol changes colour to red, then I use the \"delete\" key on the keyboard and the effect is removed.

When I type vdfuse -r \"/media/mike/DATA/VM-VHD/SGOS.vhd\" ~/Test (I just want to copy one file from that VHD), in return I get this:\nERROR: a single mountpoint must be specified\n\nDESCRIPTION: This Fuse module uses the VirtualBox access library to open a \nVirtualBox supported VD image file and mount it as a Fuse file system.  The\nmount point contains a flat directory containing the files EntireDisk,\nPartition1 .. PartitionN.

What should that \"mountpoint\" be?\n\nA: You're missing the -f option. It also looks like vdfuse needs to be told what the type of file it is.  The command should be:\nvdfuse -r -t VHD -f \"/media/mike/DATA/VM-VHD/SGOS.vhd\" ~/Test \n\nThe -f specifies the file that you're mounting. The -t means what type, since you're using VHD, that is what is specified.  \nAlso make sure that you uncomment the line for \"user_allow_other\" in /etc/fuse.conf.  To uncomment just paste the line below to a terminal:\nsudo sed -i 's/#user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf\n\nthe # is used to comment a line in a file and the sed line above removes the # from that line.\nIn my example below I am showing step-by-step of how I am able to access the files contained within my VM:\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~$ vdfuse -r -t VDI -f \"/home/terrance/VirtualBox VMs/Kubuntu 16.04/Kubuntu 16.04.vdi\" ~/Test\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~$ cd Test\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~/Test$ ls -al\ntotal 41939973\ndr-xr-x---  1 terrance terrance          0 Jun  9 14:10 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 61 terrance terrance        4096 Jun 10 16:11 ..\n-r--------  1 terrance terrance 21474836480 Jun  9 14:10 EntireDisk\n-r--------  1 terrance terrance 17178820608 Jun  9 14:10 Partition1\n-r--------  1 terrance terrance  4292870144 Jun  9 14:10 Partition5\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~/Test$ sudo mount -o loop Partition1 /mnt\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~/Test$ ls /mnt\nbin   dev  home        lib    lost+found  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var\nboot  etc  initrd.img  lib64  media       opt  root  sbin  sys  usr  vmlinuz\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Boot partition filling up: Is this a bug in Ubuntu? I keep running into the issue of the /boot partition filling up with old kernel images, which causes obscure errors during upgrades (but now I know what they are...). \nNote that I already know how to fix this thanks to Ask Ubuntu: here's my favorite answer.\nMy question is, why does Ubuntu keep doing this, and isn't this a serious design flaw? \nIn reading questions related to /boot filling up, I have seen comments like \"This happens because you assigned a small space for the boot partition or you have UEFI and forgot to increment the space.\". However, I have encountered this problem on at least three different Ubuntu installations, spanning versions from 12 to 15, and I have never used anything other than the default install options. I've always done a clean Ubuntu install using the entire disk (no dual-boot), although the drive has usually had something else on it before. \nAm I doing something wrong in the install (i.e. an option I should select)? I always assume the default options will be the safest. \nAlso, even if the install was different (i.e. no /boot, or a larger /boot), wouldn't this still be an issue? (i.e. if old kernel images are never deleted, they are going to eat up the disk space, which seems like a design flaw even if there is plenty of free space). \n\nA: \nwhy does Ubuntu keep doing this?\n\nShort version: safety.\nLong version: the kernel is the most important part of an OS. It handles communication between hardware and software, among other things that I won't cover in detail here.\nChanging the kernel might give you problems. Most of the time everything goes well, but the one time that something is screwed up you do want to have it working again quickly.\nSay you are researching materials for your thesis and the deadline is approaching... suddenly a kernel upgrade breaks your Wi-Fi. Do you prefer to postpone your graduation for saving 150 MB of disk space?\nI guess no, you don't want that. Here's why you reboot, select the previous kernel and go on with your work. Things like this don't happen often, but they may happen rarely and on some specific hardware, maybe only for one kernel release.\nI actually experienced seeing my parents' PC not accepting any keyboard input after a kernel upgrade (a simple keyboard, not a wireless one). Now, using a PC without a keyboard is not nice.\n\nisn't this a serious design flaw?\n\nNot that serious, since benefits outreach the downsides and nowadays hard drives are basically always bigger than 250 GB. Even with 10 different kernels you would occupy only like 2 GB. Yes it starts to be a waste of space after a while, but not that noticeable. Moreover you can uninstall them manually, they are not locked.\nNevertheless, it's reasonable to say that only the last few kernels are needed. That's why Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial marks as \"auto-removable\" the old kernels, except the last 2.\n\nI always assume the default options will be the safest\n\nIndeed, your assumption is correct. Ubuntu won't never let you blindly overwrite your kernel without any backup solution.\n\nA: It is the user that is responsible for removing old, unneeded kernels. So is it also the admins task to keep an eye on free space. So no, I disagree that this is a problem, a security issue or a design flaw.\nThere is a method to automatically delete kernels but the debian and/or ubuntu devs consider it problematic to decide what an \"unneeded kernel\" is so this is not a task they want to make default (... yet).\nI myself do not use a /boot so never run into this problem but if you do want one (lvm, encryption) 300Mb should be enough. \n", "Q: Recovery Windows boot entry so I had Windows 10 in my laptop.

It needs instructions on how to make uefi boot.  Go to Bios setup and you need to load the trusted uefi file.  The way I did it on my acer was to go to the security tab.  Then you set a password.  BE VERY CAREFUL and MINDFUL.. peck it with one finger twice to be sure.\nIf you mess this up, your laptop is nearly bricked, but someone can help you fix it with an external floppy disk.. yes floppy.. know anyone?\nOnce you set the password, some options will become available.  Try to I turned off tcp (not sure if that matters).  I also reset all certificates.  and then I added trusted boot file.  Try doing only last one I mentioned and see if that works by itself.\nSo when you add the trusted file (it will find the location for you..) add all the files you can.. and then set your password back to \"BLANK\".  That means type nothing.. no characters..Just hit the enter key twice..do it now before you forget your password.\nNow you can go to boot order.  You will see something like yes0.  Or something new probably at the bottom..

I've been using xfce for the past 5 years on my computers (xubuntu) and it does fullfil my expectations and requirements that are low ram usage low cpu usage and low resource usage overall and that is becouse of my OCD that i have to keep everything at low level.\nBut with a computer that uses intel i5 2th generation 3.5 Ghz and 120 GB SSD and good graphics, how noticable is the speed difference between gnome 3 and xfce 4.12 if they both use same applications (now I'm talking about program that you use to write a report or make some simulations with matlab and Android programming)? \nI personally use lightweight applications excapt chromium. I use only gtk applications and so on.\nCommon sense says that XFCE should run faster. But how faster? Are we talking about miliseconds on a computer like mine? Notice that boot time is not a really good measurement for me since i boot my computer at most frequently 1 time a week. \n\nA: With your computer you won't notice much difference. 5th generation i5's and a an SSD are a very good combination. \nThe biggest difference you will see between Xfce and gnome is in the amount of memory usage it takes. So if you are running a machine with only 1GB of ram then you will notice a significant difference.\n\nA: Measuring speed between two environments is very subjective, and not something that can really be accurately and definitively \"measured\". It depends on the machine entirely. Yes, XFCE is supposed to average faster than GNOME, but it really does depend on the machine.\nMy machine is System76's Serval WS. It has a M.2 drive, Nvidia 6 GB GeForce GTX 970M, 3.6 GHz i7-4790, and 16 GB HyperX Dual Channel DDR3 at 1866MHz.\nBoth are the same speed on my machine...very fast. There is no difference between them. If I start a Blender render, it will take the same time on both environments. Sometimes it will be faster on one, sometimes faster on the other, kinda depends on other programs and the current state of the computer, but for me, it averages to the same speed, no difference.\nI think the biggest differences between DE's is the startup time (like, logging in) and maybe some window animations (but every DE can be configured to have / not have animations). Other than that, programs, rendering, anything really is the same speed.\nIt's not like we're comparing Windows to Linux, or even one kernel build to another. Both DE's are using the same environment, the same hardware, the same programs.\n", "Q: How to ensure matplotlib in a Python 3 virtualenv uses the TkAgg backend? I am using Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3. Using APT to install python3-matplotlib and then printing the matplotlib backend gives TKAgg, which is expected because Ubuntu has 16.04 has python3-tk installed. This is done by running:\nsudo apt install python3-matplotlib\npython3 -c 'import matplotlib as mpl; print(mpl.get_backend())'\n\nHowever, if I create a virtualenv for Python 3, activate the virtualenv, install matplotlib using pip and then print the matplotlib backend, I get agg instead. This is done by running:\nvirtualenv venv -p python3\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install matplotlib\npython -c 'import matplotlib as mpl; print(mpl.get_backend())'\n\nIt looks like matplotlib in the virtualenv is not aware of the presence of the TkAgg backend in the system, which is not surprising given the virtualenv does not see the system site packages when the --system-site-packages option is not used. Forcing matplotlib to use the TkAgg backend and then importing matplotlib.pyplot gives ImportError: cannot import name '_tkagg' as expected. This is done by running:\npython -c \"import matplotlib as mpl; mpl.use('TkAgg'); import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\"\n\nTherefore, how do I ensure that matplotlib in a Python 3 virtualenv uses the TkAgg backend?\n\nA: You need to install the tk-dev package by running:\nsudo apt install tk-dev\n\nThen, reinstall matplotlib in the virtualenv by running:\npip --no-cache-dir install -U --force-reinstall matplotlib\n\nVerify the TkAgg backend is used by checking if the following code returns TkAgg:\npython -c 'import matplotlib as mpl; print(mpl.get_backend())'\n\n", "Q: Hibernating from cron I am trying to hibernate from cron using the command systemctl hibernate.

Thank you!\n\nA: Where is your partition mounted? Find that, open a terminal, and change to the directory that contains it. Then type the command ls -l. This will show you who owns the mount point and therefore all the files under it. If it's root, you can change it so that you own it by typing sudo chown [yourusername]:[yourusername] [the mountpoint] It will ask you for your password, type it in, you will not see anything as you type. This has helped me in similar situations.\n", "Q: Downloading Ubuntu 16.04 I was downloading Ubuntu 16.04 but it has downloaded a 4.86MB iso file whereas the 1.4 GB ubuntu download is still going on. Can anyone tell me why 2 files are being downloaded?\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu!\nThere is no 4.86 MB Ubuntu ISO file; the absolute smallest one is 54MB. \nIt's possible that your browser is storing the partial download in a temporary file; you can check to see if that file's size changes as your download progresses. If it is increasing in size, then your download is probably fine, and your browser will automatically merge the two files when the download is complete.\nIf you're having persistent download issues, you could try using a different browser, a download manager, or use the torrent download option for the Ubuntu ISO: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\n\nA: What browser are you using? Firefox, for example, will create a file with the same name as the file being downloaded with the extra suffix \".part\", and this file will store all the data that has been downloaded so far. It will grow in size and eventually reach the final size of the file, whereupon it is renamed to the final file name.\n\nA: There are 2 things I can think of that could cause this with the information given: \n1) The first option is that this is a temporary download file as mentioned above. Even though both those answers suggest you are using Firefox, Google Chrome still must save any downloaded data somewhere on your computer. \n2) The other option is that the download failed and automatically restarted itself.\n\nA: this maybe due to two reasons of which both are not harmful in any way to your download \n1) You must be using firefox because this has happened to me a lot of times (mainly in the case of rar/zip files)\nWhen I download a file, \nFirefox does 2 things: changes the file name to gobbledy-gook of letters and numbers, AND, adds a .part extension -- therefore the files won't open. This is a NEW problem. \nIf I manually remove the .part extension in the download folder, the file will open, but I still have the problem of the name change. I believe that the .part extension is supposed to go away when the download is finished, Also, my downloads always used to come with their original name, not a numbers/letters name.\n2)Your Antivirus has some serious permissions which you might have given it while installation \nso each and every part of data is reviewed for virus and put in another temporary file until the whole download is complete\n\nA: Or try alternativly this link https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Downloads/Xenial_Xerus/\n", "Q: cannot understand difference of my drives I have four hdd in my pc.\none of them is installed with windows7 and one of them is recently installed with ubuntu 16.06 and two of them are just for storage.\nAfter ubuntu is installed, I clicked on files which brought me to home.\nThen I take a look to the left, I can't seem to understand why is there a 67GB column which can be unmounted.\nThere is\n\n\n*\n\n*180GB volume - which is my windows7\n\n*1TB - WD - storage\n\n*2TB - WD - storage\n\n*67GB Volume - which I have no idea what this is\n\n*Computer - which I suppose is the root structure for ubuntu\n\n\n4 and 5 looks super similar though\nThis is what the 67GB Volume looks like which I have no idea what it is\n\nThis is what Computer looks like\n\nEdit:\nin df it looks like\nFilesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on\nudev             3999404       0   3999404   0% /dev\ntmpfs             803744    9904    793840   2% /run\n/dev/sdd1      472468752 4670968 443774644   2% /\ntmpfs            4018712     232   4018480   1% /dev/shm\ntmpfs               5120       4      5116   1% /run/lock\ntmpfs            4018712       0   4018712   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs             803744      44    803700   1% /run/user/1000\n\nlsblk looks like\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0 168.1G  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0     1K  0 part \n├─sda5   8:5    0  62.4G  0 part \n└─sda6   8:6    0   7.9G  0 part \nsdb      8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   0 931.5G  0 part \nsdc      8:32   0   1.8T  0 disk \n└─sdc1   8:33   0   1.8T  0 part \nsdd      8:48   0 465.8G  0 disk \n├─sdd1   8:49   0 457.9G  0 part /\n├─sdd2   8:50   0     1K  0 part \n└─sdd5   8:53   0   7.9G  0 part [SWAP]\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nAdding image shown in GParted\n\n\n\nA: What I see in the output of lsblk and df\nThe two key points are these two lines:\n├─sdd1   8:49   0 457.9G  0 part /\n\n└─sdd5   8:53   0   7.9G  0 part [SWAP]\n\n/ tells us that 457.9 G disk partition contains your currently used Ubuntu - / designates root folder, much like C:\\ on Windows. [SWAP] tells us it's the partition for your virtual memory ( which is usually serves to compensate for lack of RAM) and is typically allocated exactly the same amount of disk space as your RAM, and yes, any default installation of Ubuntu does this unless you choose manual approach . \nNext, see  the following two lines.\n─sda5   8:5    0  62.4G  0 part \n└─sda6   8:6    0   7.9G  0 part \n\nThere's your unknown 67 GB volume ( and yes, the size differs not by accident , Linux commands report size in Gibibytes , which is powers of 2 rather than convenient human-readable powers of 10 ). What's more important is the 7.9G , this is the same amount as above, indicating that's also a swap partition.\nSolving the issue\nWe've mentioned in the comments GParted , which is a very very handy tool for resizing disk partitions. The full procedure is beyond the scope of this question, but I can point you to the canonical tutorial we have: How to resize partitions? . df output tells me that your mysterious 67 GB volume there isn't mounted ( i.e. not in use by the system , which is a good thing ） ， so you could install gparted and proceed to resize that disk directly, deleting the two paritions first and then reallocating that space to be used by some other partition.\nOn a side note , you have 8 GB of swap. That much swap typically isn't needed for desktop with that much RAM. Consider deleting your /dev/sdd5 partition . Personally, I have SSD and plenty of RAM , so it would be  a waste, and so I only have one root partition and that's it. \nFinally, make sure to run sudo update-grub  in terminal after everything is done. We want the bootloader to know that we've done changes to the system. Otherwise it will be a dum-dum and try to load everything as before which may brick the system.\nIf everything succeeds, have a beer and keep enjoying Ubuntu ( responsibly ) ; and if you have any other concerns - post another question and we will do our best to help\n\nA: In ubuntu (and in linux in general) Computer or MyComputer is a Windows-like designation for /. / is the root of your Ubuntu filesystem. Just like MyComputer is the root of your Windows PC. In linux everything is interpreted as a file or folder, even the hardware parts. Hardware is located in /dev. Harddisks looks like /dev/sda , dev/sdb , etc.  \n67GB Volume is the partition where your Ubuntu is located/installed. Then why 67GB Volume is not exactly the same as Computer? Because Computer shows EVERYTHING connected to your Ubuntu, like a cdrom device, interpreted as a cdrom folder. 67GB Volume shows only elements strictly located within it. But a cdrom is a separate filesystem, not located on 67GB volume, but on a separate drive.  \nYou File Manager will always display only those partitions that can be mounted - editable from Ubuntu. Windows has some special partitions (microsoft reserved partition, recovery partition), Ubuntu has special partition (swap partition), and both Win and Ubu need a special EFI partition for UEFI computers. Special partitions cannot be edited by using usual tools, because editing them might render your operating systems unusable.\n", "Q: 16.04 - Slow Kernel Boot (LVM issue) After upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 my system boot slow down consistently \nTo analyze the cause I used this command.\nsystemd-analyze plot > boot.xml\ngoogle-chrome ./boot.xml\n\nI have found out NetworkManager-wait-online.service was taking 7s alone so I have disabled it.\nsystemctl mask NetworkManager-wait-online.service\n\nNow the result of systemd-analyze plot show that my kernel boot time is the main cause:\n\nStartup finished in 18.552s (kernel) + 4.704s (userspace) = 23.256s\n\nThe whole system use to boot in 10/15s no it take 18s only for the kernel\nHow can I found out the reason for 18s kernel boot time ? \nUPDATE\nI used @Nick suggestion dmesg > boot.txt and I was able to find out the bottleneck points\n[    2.771745] clocksource: Switched to clocksource tsc\n[    7.255226] EXT4-fs (dm-0): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.

I am learning Objective-C programming language. I have Objective-C Environment in Ubuntu 16.04 and I compile Objective-C programs using terminal. But I want to make a build command in Geany for that purpose. But Geany recognises Objective-C programs which have .m file extension as Matlab/Octave commands. So suggest me a method to compile & execute Objective-C programs directly from Geany by making a build command in Geany.\n\nA: Geany should already have a build configuration for Objective-C, provided by the filetypes.objectivec file (part of the geany-common package):\n[build_settings]\n# %f will be replaced by the complete filename\n# %e will be replaced by the filename without extension\n# (use only one of it at one time)\ncompiler=gcc -Wall -c \"%f\"\nlinker=gcc -Wall -o \"%e\" \"%f\" -lobjc\nrun_cmd=\"./%e\"\n\nThe tricky part is making geany actually choose that, instead of the one for Matlab (since both filetypes are associated with the .m extension in the filetype_extensions.conf file). Currently, the only way I know to do that is to manually select the filetype from the Document menu\nDocument --> Set Filetype --> Programming Languages --> Objective-C\n\nAfter that, you should be able to build your file from the Build menu as normal.\n", "Q: I tried to uninstall a program using apt-get but I can still use it I tried to uninstall a emacs through terminal in Lubuntu 15 and Its still there. \nI used the code: \nsudo apt-get remove --purge emacs\n\nThis has happened before with a chess program called scid. \nBasically, after I deleted emacs, it displays:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge emacs\nReading package lists...

Within the first several lines you will see various sizes designated for the particular scroll-setting options. For instance, within the file for version 3.20.4 the icon sizes start on line 36. Change each of those levels to whatever you want to use so that you can make the icons much smaller (or larger).\n\n*After editing and saving the file, it's time to configure, compile, and install. Run the following commands from the terminal from within the base directory of the version of nautilus that you have downloaded and unzipped. Make sure that you are within the base of the folder structure of the nautilus directories!\n./configure  \nmake  \nsudo make install\n\nThis can be run altogether with the command ./configure && make && make install.\nIf the ./configure command fails it's because you are missing some other dependencies.

I've been looking for alternatives but instead of \"when\" which I don't like, I can't find anything else, so help is welcome.\n\nA: gnome-schedule is indeed not in the official Ubuntu repositories for Ubuntu 16.04.\nHowever, at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-schedule/+bug/1576060/comments/23, Kartik (kartik-arora95) has kindly compiled a .deb package for version 2.3.0 of Gnome Schedule that is reportedly working for Ubuntu 16.04. Download the .deb package provided at the aforementioned link and then install it using:\nsudo dpkg -i gnome-schedule_2.3.0-0ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb\n\n\nA: Used gnome-schedule for many years in many earlier versions of Ubuntu. Nice one. Ubuntu 16.04 not having gnome-schedule is highly inconvenient. A verified source is here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+package/gnome-schedule\nYou will require to compile from sources.\n\nA: I have compiled gnome-scheduler for 16.04 by editing the Ubuntu source package for Natty a bit.

I would like to replace a specific clip inside a project with another one from the project bin but keep all applied effects and the length of the original clip. \n\nCan this be done in Kdenlive?\n\nA: The inability to easily replace the footage of a clip while retaining the effect stack and transitions is a pretty big limitation that I've run into as well.  I found a work-around that works as long as your clips are video files and not image sequences.  If you move the source clips before starting kdenlive, then when you open your project, kdenlive won't be able to find them and will present you with a list of clips that it can't find, which will be all the ones that you moved.  \nI found that you can double-click on each entry in the list and navigate to your new (in this case, stabilized) footage and select it.  \nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to work with image sequence clips because it doesn't present the correct dialog box for that.  I might try directly editing the kdenlive file and see if that works..\n\nA: In \"project bin\", right click on the clip and you gonna find replace clip menu item and find new clip in the file system.\n\nA: The best answer I can think of is naming the original clip abc_original.format and replacing the stabilized clip as ABC.format. Then restart Kdenlive. This might cause problems but it worked for me with a few audio files.\n\nA: \"You could try opening the project file in a text or xml editor. And then you could do a search and replace and replace your old clip name with your new stabilised clip name.\nDo this on a copy of your project file of course\"\nStolen from this website\nIt worked for me!\n\nA: I don't know which effects you have with your clip, but you can readily delete the unwanted clip by placing the cursor over it, left click (it should get a red enclosing marker) and then use the \"delete\" key to delete it. You should then be free to insert your new clip into the space on the timeline, it can be expanded to fill the empty space by clicking the cursor on the edge and dragging to the desired width. I usually find transitions carry over, but it's probably best to delete them and re-do them for the new clip. Try it, and check your effects while at it. Good luck.\n", "Q: Moving Cursor Position in Kdenlive? I have difficulties moving the cursor to a certain clip position in Kdenlive. \nI demonstrated the issue in this short screencast and reported it as the following bug.\nIs anyone affected by the same problem?\n\nA: I was facing the exact same issue. The cursor was somehow stuck at the beginning of the video while using kdenlive. \nI tried the fix mentioned here to delete the ~/.config/kdenliverc file, but in fact I couldn't find such a file in my system.\nI could not even find a .kdenlive directory in my home folder as suggested on other forums. \nFinally what solved the problem for me was switching to the Project Monitor instead of the Clip monitor in kdenlive. I have no idea how I switched to the Clip monitor in kdenlive, but when I switched back to the Project Monitor, the cursor was again movable.\n", "Q: What versions of linux work on Dell dimension 4600 i386 system My 1st install was on a Dell Dimension 4600i 386 2002 vintage machine.\nI tried Ubuntu 16.04 -desktop-i386, which was slow, especially from keyboard...like 1-2 characters/min. - I suspected the problem may have been keyboard entry related.\nI next tried Linix Lite-2.8-32 bit, which had hang ups with US english translation, google & google chrome issues.\nEventually I got it to work well for a short time, but following an update, it ground to a halt.\nAs a standard feature it would not display a sign-in screen at start-up for entry code, did display a p/w entry box though.

I plan to set up a PPA or perhaps submit my package to Debian, but there is something I really need to know, I understand that packages normally do something with /var/run/reboot-required and are listed in /var/run/reboot-required.pkg, but how exactly does one create a deb file which tells the system through that method that a reboot is required to make all the necessary changes? Is there simply a flag I need to set in one of the files or is it more manual than that? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\n\nA: If you do need a reboot after installation you will make a call to /usr/share/update-notifier/notify-reboot-required in the .postinst script for your package.  This can easily be found be reading the .postinst script of any linux-image package. \nHowever, I would be concerned about any custom PPA that requires a reboot after installation.  \nOther than kernel updates, there are few packages that require a reboot.  There are important libraries that may required certain services to be restarted. \nIf your install script requires the service it installed to be restarted, it should perform the restart as part of the post installation procedure.  This is normally the case for daemon processes.  \nMany packages don't require any restart at all.  \n", "Q: Does getdeb change applications that do not need it? There is an application I really want to install (RubyRipper), which seems to only be possible in a way visible to apt by using getdeb. However, I don't want new (and possibly less stable) versions of my existing applications.\nFor example, I wouldn't want firefox replaced with a version other than that available from the default Ubuntu repository. Same thing with any other application: vlc, texstudio, libre office, etc.\nWould using getdeb cause my existing applications to be updated from different repositories? (According to my research, this seems to be the case). If so, can I make getdeb only act as a repository for applications not available elsewhere?\n\nA: \nWould using getdeb cause my existing applications to be updated from different repositories? \n\nYes, potentially, if Getdeb offers a newer version of something than what is in the official repositories, apt may install that newer version when you do an update. (Be default, Ubuntu will use the newest version of packages).\nIf you use apt-get install in a terminal to install / update things (instead of the GUI), it will always tell you what it's going to do, before it does anything, so you can be sure.\nYou could either download the .deb file yourself, and install that, or add the Getdeb repository, install the package you want, and then disable the Getdeb repository afterwards.\nThere's also a PPA for RubyRipper, which I think would be a better choice (more up to date, contains only that package, directly from the author). Note that neither Getdeb nor the PPA have builds for the latest versions of Ubuntu, and the PPA says:\n\nDevelopment has slowed down considerably at the time I'm writing this. The best current way to rip audio is Morituri, which is available in Precise and beyond.\n\nso maybe there are other options for ripping audio ? \n", "Q: mail not sending or receiving ?

(offtopic/)\nIf anything is unclear for you, don't mind asking.  \n\nA: I am adding this answer here for anyone for whom ppa-purge method didnt work.  \nFor me, for some reason ppa-purge was unable to remove the ppa and downgrade the packages. I had to manually do it.  \n\n\n*\n\n*First go to /etc/apt/sources.list.d. This is a directory that contains all the PPA files.  \n. Delete the PPA files for backports. In my case they were : kubuntu-ppa-ubuntu-backports-bionic.list and kubuntu-ppa-ubuntu-backports-bionic.list.save. (You may need to open the terminal and do sudo rm for this)  \n\n*Remove plasma: sudo apt remove plasma*\n\n*Remove kdeplasma : sudo apt remove kdeplasma*\n\n*This might remove kde-runtime. So install it again. sudo apt install kde-runtime\n\n*Install plasma desktop again. sudo apt install plasma-desktop\n\n*Now it is time to reinstall everything you had deleted.\nsudo apt install kdeplasma*\nsudo apt install plasma* \nWhile doing this you may get errors like unmet-dependencies and broken packages. Every package that is broken, you need to reinstall it to previous version. In the error , you will get a list of packages that could not be installed. \nSo if one of the entry is something like: \n\n[package1] : Depends: [package2] (>= [some number]) but [some number]ubuntu1 is to be installed...  \n\nAll you have to do is reinstall package2.\nsudo apt remove [package2]\nsudo apt install [package2]\n\n\n*Now restart plasma shell\nkillall plasmashell\nkstart plasmashell\nIf you get errors like kstart:command not found, make sure you have installed kde-runtime.\nsudo apt install kde-runtime \n\n*Now it may appear as if in the system tray and start menu, everything is out of place , font is not proper etc. This should be fixed on rebooting. But before you reboot you should install login theme, else you might have problems logging back in during reboot.\nsudo apt install sddm-theme-breeze\n\n*reboot\n\n*Once you have rebooted, you can check the version of your shell to make sure you have successfully downgraded to stable version. plasmashell -v\n\n*Now you can remove unnecessary packages that might have been installed by doing sudo apt autoclean\n", "Q: how to code in ubuntu? I used turbo c++ in windows to write c/c++ codes. Recently I started using Ubuntu, now where should i write c/c++ code in Ubuntu like we used to do in windows? Which software should I download from Ubuntu app store to write code?\nPlease note that I am not asking how to compile I am asking where to and in which software to write code.\n\nA: In my opinion, there is no need for any IDEs to compile and execute most of the programs in c/c++.\nYou can use any text editors like Gedit, nano , Vi/Vim  to write the code and compile it using gcc or g++ which are installed by default.\nInstall the (sufficient) packages for once.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nNext time, To compile a c program, Go to terminal, and execute :\ngcc /path/to/your/program/my_c_program.c -o outputfile.out\n\nTo Execute the compiled file, \n./outputfile.out\n\nYou can know more about gcc and g++ from its man pages.\nman gcc\nman g++\n\n\nA: When youre looking for an IDE there are many possibilities of which I want to cover one, its is called Code::Blocks and runs cross platform (Windows/Linux) you can install it from the standard repositories with\nsudo apt-get install codeblocks\n\nThe following screen-shot gives you an idea of the UI of it.\n\n\nA: All other answers so far just suggest and IDE. When you say \"Please note that I am not asking how to compile I am asking where to and in which software to write code.\" I understand the where to as also asking which compilers to use.\nThe first place to start for C/C++ is the the Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC). The easiest way to install GCC plus the other essentials for building software is to install the build essential meta package:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nNow you have a compiler you need and IDE. This, as everyone points, out is a personal choice. Some examples are:\nKate: Awesome, but usage requires a bit of extra knowledge.\nI really like Kate, a simple text editor, where you can customise its behaviour for each type of file. You can also set up projects (this currently involves manually writing a project file) and get a terminal in as a panel in Kate. I then compile using my own make files. This is rather hands on, but gives you more fine grained control and understanding of what is going on.\nCode::Blocks: More simple to use, but in my opinion more overbearing than kate.\nAs previously mentioned Code:Blocks is a fully functional IDE available for Linux and Windows. The makes it easy to if you want the same IDE when working on both platforms. It also has the \"benefit\" of graphical tools for setting up compiler options, and a simple button to easily compile simple programs.\nEclipse CDT I have heard it is popular, personally too huge and clumbersome for my taste\nEclipse is a huge cross plattform Java IDE, but it has plugins for developing almost anything else. The CDT plugin is for C/C++. I looked at the IDE briefly and had no love for it. I admit this may not be fair judgement but I saw no benefits over say Code::Blocks and a quick check of apt shows that to install Eclipse and Eclipse-cdt would require 237 MB of archives, Code::Blocks is 6.4 MB, and Kate is simply the standard KDE text editor which comes with my Kubuntu (0.5 kB package, but an unfair comparison as it is already installed so I am not sure what the dependencies would be on vanilla Ubuntu). I am not saying Eclipse is bad per se, just that I see no reason why any IDE should require 1/4 of a GB of space.\nThere are, of course, many many other options.\n\nA: You have a lot of editors to choose from. I am using Geany for writing the code and gdb for debugging, because the applications I write need special environment where running IDE would not be a good idea. I have seen many people using Eclipse, which also supports GUI for debugging with the help of gdb.\nYou should look and find the one that suits you the best. Take a look here for some descriptions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24109/c-ide-for-linux\n\nA: Source code is text, so any text editor will do...\nThat said: most programmers appreciate lexical (syntax) highlighting and many  text editors offer that (certainly any that we're going to talk about), as well as some basic tools that will make coding generally easier and more efficient (tabs, windows, search/replace, etc.).\nThis question really has everything to do with preference. Since there are no special criteria in the question that help narrow down better suggestion this answer will be necessarily broad but I will attempt to provide enough information that you can determine which option(s) might best satisfy your preferences.\nTL;DR\nWhy do so many people put this at the end? Let's get it out of the way, right now.\nIf you want to skip reading to the end: I use vim in the terminal, Atom in a desktop environment and if I was recommending a general-purpose IDE then it would probably IntelliJ IDEA, but I rarely use an IDE anymore.\nThere are many options, I'll give a couple in each of three categories (I have used each of these in development, (albeit some very briefly):\nTerminal Text Editors\nThis is home turf to many people engaged in coding in a Unix-like environment. You have advantages when developing remotely using simple tools like ssh, etc. and there is basically zero impact on the system... These tools are so light weight and fast that, I kid you not, some people I have worked with actually want something clunkier... you know something that, \"feels like a program is running\".\nVim is my favorite and what I use more often than any of the examples that I'll be listing here, or in any category. If you're a touch typer and want an editor which you can configure to be exactly what you need and don't really want to ever have to reach for the mouse... these and many other nerdy wonders await you in vim. It's fast and efficient, and once you get used to it you will wish [insert anything here] was as cool as vim.\nNano is another common suggestion in this category; In my opinion, whereas it might be simpler starting out, ultimately vim is a superior product. I have used it and did not find any advantage over Vim, except for a somewhat shallower learning curve... but people who think you can't become effective writing in Vim in your first session... sorry, almost because a tangential off-topic rant.\nI'll mention Emacs as another obvious option but it's not one I have used so cannot recommend personally, it has however (as does vi/vim) a cult-like following and probably at least a few of those followers are using it for practical reasons.\nNote that the above are all free\nGUI Text Editors\nIf you don't live in the terminal, and/or don't want to, then there are some really good text editors, which feature add-ons that can make your coding more pleasant and efficient, and are yet much lighter and quicker than a fully-bloated full-blown IDE.\nI am dead split between suggesting Atom and Sublime Text. I have used and enjoyed both.\nAtom is wide open and hackable. There are more and more community-built tools coming out everyday. They can tweak everything from looks to function. There is no end to the fun there. It is also free and open-source.\nSublime is not open source, nor is it free (but it's cheap and 110% worth the price, which at this writing is $70). It does currently run a little quicker and look a little nicer than Atom. It is also very configurable, if a little more locked up than Atom.\nThe comparison between these two is natural to me; they are natural competitors and very similar, have the same target audience, etc. I neither like one more than the other, nor would suggest one over the other. It's really about preferences, they are both able tools.\nAnd since Atom if free, and Sublime is free to try, there is no harm in testing out both.\nHonorable mention goes out to Kate (and cousin KDevelope) and Gedit; good tools, but I think if you like those you owe it to yourself to at least look at Atom and Sublime, which I prefer at least.\nFull IDE\nOK. Full disclosure: I am biased and walked away from IDEs a while back and have no real desire to go back. That said, some programming (like Android) appears to almost require an IDE. In my opinion they are bloated and slow far out of proportion to any gains you get from them.\nThose I have used: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, NetBeans.\nI would recommend IntelliJ IDEA over the others. But if you like Eclipse (many, many people do) then it's basically the same. I mean they all get you to where you're going, I just have had the fewest annoying moments working in IntelliJ IDEA than in the others.\n", "Q: Errors on \"apt-get update\" after trying to install

Where does openssh-server get the \"Last Login\" information from?\nI recently logged in remotely from a Windows machine using SSH Secure Shell 3.2.9 and the reported last login was from a network location I do not recognize. I then checked auth.log (more specifically, auth.log.1) and found no log entries pertaining to the reported network location. I usually remote in via VPN so I know the IP of the computer logged-in changes. However, it typically takes the form of an IP address where as this particular attempt was recorded as unknownComputerName.knownNetworkName. I find it a bit odd that there is no matching entry in auth.log because I know for a fact that even failed attempts are recorded.\nAlso, I am new to using Ubuntu and a novice at remote access. That being said, please correct any mistakes I may have made with regards to terminology. Also, please let me know if this type of question is better asked somewhere else.\n\nA: There is database in /var/log/lastlog (binary AFAIK). See the manual page for lastlog(8).

I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop (Acer E 15 E5-571G-51XR) and it was doing pretty fine until a weird issue popped up roughly 3 weeks later. Whenever I would press the key T on my laptop keyboard, the current screen would freeze - cannot move the cursor, keyboard stops working - followed by a black screen (the screen doesn't turn off; I can see the backlight). Only thing I'm able to do is a forced power off (pressing the power key for sometime until the system powers down). Also, this behaviour is completely random; it does not happen every time I press T. It is just random. Can anyone help me with this weird situation?\nSome more information on this,\n\n\n*\n\n*I got this issue on LiveCD too.\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 has a similar tale.\n\n*I popped the T key, cleaned the membrane inside, kept it back. The issue persists.\n\n*There's nothing printed about the freeze in dmesg or syslog. In fact, there are absolutely no entries in any of the logs from the time when the system freezes till it starts again.\n\n*One interesting thing. When I turn on the laptop after the forced power down, it boots normally except on one screen where you actually see a terminal like view which prints the boot messages. On that screen, I can see a pattern being continuously printed as if someone has kept some key pressed. Something like this ^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@. And only when I press some other key, the stream stops.\n\n*I got another USB keyboard and it didn't give me any issues so far. I guess it's related to the keyboard on the laptop.\n\n\nA: It seems the issue was with the hardware membrane for the T key. I popped out the key, tried pushing the membrane hard (Ubuntu froze and got a black screen), tried lifting the membrane up a little, cleaned it. Since then, I didn't get any issues so far. It seems, moving the membrane a little bit did the trick.\n", "Q: If OpenVPN crashes or loses connection, can it revert silently to the default route? I have set up OpenVPN nd it is working. However, there is one thing I doubt:\nOn client machine, the routing after OpenVPN starts looks like this:\n0.0.0.0/1 via 10.8.0.5 dev tun0 \ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev enp3s0  proto dhcp  src 192.168.1.33  metric 1024 \n10.8.0.1 via 10.8.0.5 dev tun0 \n10.8.0.5 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.8.0.6 \n128.0.0.0/1 via 10.8.0.5 dev tun0 \n\nIf OpenVPN crashes or loses connection, can it revert silently to the default route, line number 2? This way, the client connection to generic Internet will be unprotected without warning. Can it happen? Do I need to write scripts to tear down old routes after VPN starts?\n\nA: In all but the oddest of cases your vpn does actually use the default route to get the vpn endpoint. VPN is a typically implemented as a tunnel into a private network over external untrusted networks. It makes the traffic invisible.\nWhen your VPN connection looses sync the tunnel might struggle for a few packets but ultimately is dropped at your end and your traffic will not get further than your end of the vpn tunnel, typically this will be some funky kind of network device. This should cause your application to software to raise an error , however this is a protocol specific as some will automatically attempt to resume over any available connection others are tied to specifics for security , performance or operational requirements.\nSomething to be careful about with VPN usage when you need to hide what you are doing is DNS , not all VPN solutions send the DNS queries via the VPN link, this is like giving a list of hosts you access to the owners of the DNS server or anyone who can sniff the traffic in between.\n\nA: I've done some research and found out I was right. It is indeed as I feared6 after VPN disconnection apllications silently revert to default route. To prevent this, I should use firewall.\nFrom Arch Wiki:\n# Default policies\n ufw default deny incoming\n ufw default deny outgoing\n\n # Openvpn interface (adjust interface accordingly to your configuration)\n ufw allow in on tun0\n ufw allow out on tun0\n\n # Local Network (adjust ip accordingly to your configuration)\n ufw allow in on enp3s0 from 192.168.1.0/24\n ufw allow out on enp3s0 to 192.168.1.0/24\n\n # Openvpn (adjust port accordingly to your configuration)\n ufw allow out on enp3s0 to any port 1194\n ufw allow in on enp3s0 from any port 1194\n\nAnd if you need DNS to access your VPN server:\n# DNS\n ufw allow in from any to any port 53\n ufw allow out from any to any port 53\n\n", "Q: How to force gcc & ld (make wholly) use less memory? I have to compile a computer generated source with my sources which is too huge and I've no control over it. Since my memory is not much, I've to force make use less memory. Otherwise, it gets killed by OS (precise).\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: How about adding more swap to your machine as a solution? This will add more virtual memory and may allow you to build your code without the OOM killer killing the compiler.  If you don't want to fiddle around with making your swap partition larger your could add a temporary swap file. For example, adding a file based 4GB swap:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=swap.img bs=1M count=4096\nmkswap swap.img\nchmod 0600 swap.img \nsudo chown root:root swap.img\nswapon swap.img\n\n\nA: Have you tried using nice? It allows to set a custom priority for your processes. nice ranges from -20 to 19, being 19 the lowest priority and -20 the highest. You could try something like this:\nnice -n 19 command_you_want_to_execute\n\nExample:\nnice -n 19 firefox\n\nEdit: ellaborating a bit on my response, if your OS kills your process it's because is using resources that are needed for the correct functioning of your system. If you give your process a lower priority, those resources will automatically be allocated to more important system tasks.\n", "Q: Lots of ram uses in Ubuntu 16.04 After latest update of Ubuntu I found out that it's using lots of RAM.

It's the menu entry from ubuntu and 2 (out of 9) submenu entries from advanced boot options:\n# # BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom_proxy ###\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu 16\" --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be' {\nrecordfail\nload_video\ngfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\ninsmod gzio\nif [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='hd0,msdos5'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos5 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos5 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos5  4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\nfi\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-21-generic root=UUID=4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\ninitrd  /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-21-generic\n}\n# ## END /etc/grub.d/40_custom_proxy ###\n\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-21-generic\" --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-4.4.0-21-generic-advanced-4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be' {\n    recordfail\n    load_video\n    gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod gzio\n    if [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='hd0,msdos5'\n    if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos5 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos5 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos5  4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\n    else\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\n    fi\n    echo    'Loading Linux 4.4.0-21-generic ...'\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-21-generic root=UUID=4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n    echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-21-generic\n}\n\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-24-generic\" --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-4.4.0-24-generic-advanced-4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be' {\n    recordfail\n    load_video\n    gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod gzio\n    if [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='hd0,msdos5'\n    if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos5 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos5 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos5  4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\n    else\n      search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be\n    fi\n    echo    'Loading Linux 4.4.0-24-generic ...'\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-24-generic root=UUID=4e2b96c0-04a0-4750-bd14-479f684bf3be ro  quiet splash $vt_handoff\n    echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-24-generic\n}\n\nI 'm not sure how relevant that is - and that file is supposed to not be changed. But I m guessing that whatever the problem is it can create a footprint in that file to be identified. (Hopefully.)\n\nA: After looking around in /boot/grub/grub.cfg wondering if I should change stuff I remembered that I had used grub-customiser when I set up my system. I opened it to see what I would find there.\nThere were removed entries from both Ubuntu and Windows 7. Somehow the removed Ubuntu entry had ver 4.4.0-24 at it's details (maybe update-grub auto updated it?). I am not sure. I removed my entry and restored that one as the first option. Now Ubuntu loads at newest installed kernel:\n$ uname -r\n4.4.0-24-generic\n\nand I hope everything will work fine. (At least until next kernel update.)\nFrom some entries in grub-customizer I suspect that if an entry is labelled as custom it doesn't get updated when a newer kernel is installed? Not sure.\nAnyway, thank you to everyone who commented and helped me figure it out. Couldn't have done without you.\n", "Q: Where is enp4s0 configured? In Debian Jessie, a typical /etc/network/interfaces contains a line that looks like this:\nauto eth0\n    allow-hotplug eth0\n    iface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThis causes eth0 to be configured when ifup -a is invoked and allows DHCP to assign an IP address. However, when I open up /etc/network/interfaces in Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), I observe that no such directives are present:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nWhat happened to eth0 (or its Ubuntu equivalent enp4s0)? I have Xen installed, if that makes any difference.\n\nA: The interface just has another name, a so-called Predictable Interface Name, probably assigned after a kernel upgrade. You can work with the NIC exactly as if it was called eth[N].\n\nA: This is the normal behavior when you are using an Ubuntu flavor with a desktop environment, because all the flavors (except ubuntu server) are using the gnome network manager to handle connections. You can still edit the /etc/network/interfaces file as shown here: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html (run ifconfig to see the connection name, because they are named different now) but then any changes you do at one connection with the gnome network manager will be ignored, so it's better use the Network Connections app (click on network applet on the panel and choose Edit Connections).\n", "Q: What is the best/most correct way to prepare the HDD for a dual boot? I need to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 16.04, but first I’d like to know whether or not there is a best / most correct way to do it, technically speaking.\nNote 1: Ubuntu will be my default operating system. I'll use Windows only when I have work to do at home.\nNote 2: I do not want to use Windows on a virtual machine. Believe me, I've already tried it, but I work with AutoCAD and it gets really slow on a VM. My PC has 4 GB RAM only and I can't afford to buy more RAM for the time being; and -- No! -- I'm not planning on using any program other than AutoCAD, so I'll stick with dual boot for now. No problem.\nI have a 1 TB hard drive. My plan is to partition it like this:\n900 GB for Ubuntu - 890 GB root (/) and 10 GB swap (for hibernation matters)\n100 GB for Windows - which will be more than enough for me\nBy the way, I don't like using a /home partition.\nMy doubts are:\n1) How should I partition the HDD? 890/10/100 GB? 100/890/10 GB? 890/100/10 GB? I mean, is it better to have the Linux partition at the beginning of the HDD, or should it be the Windows one? Should the swap partition be at the end? Or whatever? Is there a better / more appropriate way to do it?\n2) Which should I install first, Windows or Ubuntu? In my experience, it's easier when Ubuntu is installed after Windows. Ubuntu seems to deal very well with GRUB stuff by itself, automatically. But if you guys tell me it's better to install Windows after Ubuntu, I'll definitely do it; just tell me the reasons why and point me to a good guide and I'll follow it.\nI want my operating systems to run as smoothly as possible together, so if you can help me with the best technical solution to make it all work correctly, I'll appreciate it.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: The way I 'd do it is install windows from scratch on the PC formatting the whole HDD. Then I would use the windows disk management utility to shrink the windows partition to 100 Gb. (The last stems from the rule of a thumb: Use windows programs for Windows stuff and linux programs for linux stuff.) Leave the 900 gb as unallocated space. After that I would install Ubuntu. Install Ubuntu alongside windows will handle everything like a charm. The only 'problem' is that this way it will probably not create the 10 gb swap you want, so you may have to manually do it.\n\nA: Here's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install windows first. During the installation, you will be given the opportunity to tell the installer how to partition your disk. I'd suggest formatting the disk here, and deleting all existing partitions so that there's noting left over from previous use. Then, reate a new 100GB partition for Windows, leaving the rest as unallocated space, and complete the installation.\n\n*Then, Install Ubuntu. I'd choose the option to partition the Disk manually when the installer asks how to install (Side-by-side with windows, replace Windows, or manual). Then, In the unallocated space, create your new 10 GB swap partition, making sure you select to use it as \"Linux swap\". Next, create your main 890GB main partition for Ubuntu with the rest of the unallocated, and choose \"/\" as the mount point. Note that your 1TB hard drive won't actually give you 1TB - it will show as having a little less space then that.\nUbuntu will take care of setting up GRUB and the dual boot during the installation, and, when your reboot, it  will offer you a menu asking you which OS you want to start - with Ubuntu selected by default, and it starts Ubuntu if you don't choose Windows within 10 sec or so - so you've basically got Ubuntu as your main OS.\nRegarding the layout of the partitions of the disk - the beginning of the disk is always faster. This means that the things you use often should be near the beginning of the disk in order to get maximum performance. In this case, the Ubuntu install is fairly close the the beginning of the disk (110GB in), giving you good performance in both Ubuntu and Windows, as well as for the swap partition. Note that the performance differences between the beginning and end of the disk are fairly minor though. This does not apply to SSDs.\nYou should definitely install Windows first - it's a lot easier.\n", "Q: Where is Wacom Settings on Kubuntu 16.04?

I do this by plugging in the bootable disk into the computer, booting into BIOS, and setting the USB drive as the primary boot device. I have successfully done this many times in the past with this disk.Since it seemed to not be working, I  formatted the USB and created another bootable Boot Repair Disk.  \nUpon booting from BIOS from the USB stick I am confronted with the primary grub loader for Boot Disk which gives the option to edit the launch settings for Boot Repair disk. Hitting enter simply yielded a black screen, so I rebooted and this time edited the launch options with -nomodeset, but it never reaches the GUI environment.(It started to load once but never made it fully into the GUI). \nI also downloaded Super Grub 2 Disk but could not get that working either as it seemed to get stuck in a boot loop. (there was only one launch option in the launch options which was 'DEFAULT', and when I select that the boot countdown recommences and it stays like that in a loop forever until I shut down or reboot)\nI am running a 64 bit installation of Ubuntu 14.04 on a dual boot machine with Windows7 that boots primarily with Windows Loader. I then launch my Ubuntu from a Grub4Dos that is launched by the Windows loader.\nHardware setup is a GeForce GTX 970 graphics card, Intel i5-6500 processor, GIGABYTE Z170N-GAMING 5 MOtherboard running F4 BIOS, with 16 GIGS of DDR4 Ram \nI am confused as to why this wont work. I have used this awwesome tool on many machines without fail. I desperately need this utility as it is an integral tool for fixing boot options.\n\nA: NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 970 is a quite new graphics adapter, which often has compatibility issues with the open source nouveau drivers. Boot from the USB drive - once the GRUB menu appears, press the E key and add the parameter nouveau.modeset=0 instead of nomodeset. Now you should be able to boot properly into the boot-repair-disk environment. The same method is valid for successfully booting other Linux based distributions and most of the Linux installation media. \n\nA: I misread your post and had a walkthrough on fixing the USB volume. I'm sorry, this was a gross error on my part.\nYou can fix a boot volume all you want, but you'll never fix a PHYSICALLY BAD DISK.\nFrom an ubuntu installer disk, run repair mode. It shouldn't take you to a GUI, you should be left at a prompt.\nI believe this disk has fdisk and badblocks, which are the two programs you need to verify the disk you're attempting to repair.\nFrom the root prompt run\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nand provide us the output.\nAlso, if you can easily identify which drive you're attempting to repair run...\nsudo badblocks /dev/[devicename]\n\nDevice name should look something like \"sda\" or \"nvme0\" or \"hda\".\nPlease provide that output as well.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the advanced MATE menu have Education?

Once more, check the port forwarding on your router and make sure that you even have public IP to connect.\n\nA: Turns out my ISP was blocking port 22 all along!\nFollowing Jakuje's tips I looked into the port forwarding. I am now using a virtual server to redirect port 2222 to 22, so I didn't have to change anything in my configurations, just add a :2222 at the end of my IP.\nThanks for all the help guys!\n\nA: OpenSSH may be unreliable.

When I initially installed Ubuntu, I received an internal error which didn't cause the desktop to load, so I reinstalled it. At the time, I didn't like grub, so I decided to convert the partition into empty space. After installing Ubuntu and rEFInd, when I tried to switch over to Windows, I was brought to the grub rescue terminal where it said that boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod was not found. I already ran boot repair, the log for it is right here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/17234595/, but it still didn't fix the problem nor did running sudo update-grub. Is there any solution to this problem? Thanks.\n\nA: You may have uninstalled the windows boot loader when you converted the grub partition to blank space.

If that is unsuccessful, try doing\nsudo apt-get purge compiz && sudo apt-get install compiz\n\n\nA: so you have access to terminal,\nand you all ready do apt-get update,apt-get upgrade\ntype compiz in terminal to start it,\nthen type unity..\nif that not give you graphical desktop,\ntype reboot,and when computer do rebooting,press and keep left shift button on keyboard to enter in recovery mode..\nfrom there chose 1st to enable networking,and be sure that cable of Ethernet(internet)is in..\nand then do recovery ..basically from there we can all,but we need to know if you came there..\nyes,i am going easy on you..to not push too much commands..dont worry..\nto me seems that Nvidia driver(gpu driver is not activated..)\nbut we will see after from terminal for sure,if you installing for 1st time,then is better(faster,easier) to do reinstall,then to fix this..\nas for fixing we need to know what is wrong..from terminal output..\nor read output pasted to paste-bin or similar service..\nreally reinstall is more easier option in your case, as fixing is worth time consuption only when we save data,or when we deal with system what was working..not for fresh install..i crash my system for purpose,so many times..only i am not familiar with exact nvidia drivers..but for start to get thing working use open source drivers,and after you can change to closed source,as i believe that is what you what to use with gaming class card..yep,will be nice to check if nvidia driver is loaded..but above all to read log files..maybe you overlook something,some step during installation..and yes tell us is this fresh installation or upgrade?\nif is upgrade then from what previous version of ubuntu?\n\nA: There is the option to try reinstalling Ubuntu all over again. \nFrom the comments & answers there are a number of things that are going wrong. Compiz is complaining and giving you a blank desktop & you don't have an internet connection which would be needed to reinstall compiz for example.\nBeing able to update & reinstall packages is in most of the possible solutions to 'fix' your current problems.\nTry running the live USB without installing and see what works 'out of the box'. Does the live USB show the desktop without any problems? Are you able to connect to Wi-Fi?\nThese things will let you see if there is a problem with just this particular attempt at installing or if your setup is tricky (e.g a graphics card or Wi-fi that will require additional drivers).\nIt's not that it can't be fixed, but without Wi-fi working a lot of options to 'narrow down' where the problem lies (by reinstalling the Unity Desktop or Compiz for example) will not be possible.\n", "Q: Make Lubuntu's login screen solid color Since i3 appears to inherit the wallpaper from Lubuntu (16.04)'s login screen, I figure I need to change the latter.

How exactly you add the keyboard shortcut depends on your distro.\n\nA: You need both redshift and redshift-gtk installed if you want to control it out of the terminal. If you want to just keep redshift, open up a terminal, enter redshift, press Enterand wait until it boots. To open it automatically after login, you'll need to open up the Startup applications app and add redshift if it isn't already there. You might as well skip this last step and see if it works by logging out and back in.\n\nA: I was having the same problem with my new installation of Ubuntu 16.04. Flux & redshift would not work at all. This is what worked for me, your mileage may vary: So I was having a different problem with my sound card and when I completely removed PulseAudio and all its dependencies, and purged apt-get, flux started working automagically! I then reinstalled the PulseAudio system and reinstalled the desktop and flux is still working!!!

I can, however, see my neighbor's centuryilnk wifi networks as they show up in my list of available wifi networks. \nI am using a C2000T modem/router. The ethernet connection works just fine.

So recently I've gotten my hands onto a decent enough hard drive that can run Ubuntu good enough and installed it. It was a Toshiba 1TB USB 3.0, though I don't know the model. \nI installed Linux on the Toshiba hard drive. Using the \"Something Else\" install option, I gave it 2GB (2048mb) of Swap storage and 128GB (131072mb) for the main OS, and after installation, I created a partition out of the rest of the storage on it in Windows 10 for storage that both OSes can read. My windows 10 is installed on my Internal SSD, typical. \nSo here's my problem: I can't install Ubuntu on my PC without it overwriting the default Windows 10 bootloader. This is a problem for a couple of reasons. One thing is that I can't boot into either OS I have without the Hand Drive plugged in. If I try to, it'll say something about the ubuntu install not being present and readable, and it enters GRUB recovery mode which I have no knowledge of. \nAnother reason is that last time I installed Ubuntu, it was a disaster. I made a partition on my hard drive for Ubuntu, and dual booted it. I thought that the GRUB bootloader was normal at the time and nothing to do with the install, even though it's sorta Ubuntu styled, I left it. Then something happened, I suspect it to do with Windows Update, I suddenly couldn't boot to it. I had to get a hard drive, even when inspecting it with one of my friends who has lots of knowledge on Windows (and nothing with Linux). So I decided to not partition anything and install Ubuntu onto a seperate hard drive. Then, I did as mentioned above before describing my problem. And this is to do with the Bootloader, though I still don't want to do anything with partitioning my Internal SSD, which again, has nothing but Windows. \nSo anyways, I have Windows Update installed, disabled all Windows Services and Tasks that auto updates anything, and I'm careful whenever updating ANYTHING, even my video games. \nAnd before you say that I should just use some application that installed some other Windows Bootloader, I tried, but the outcome wasn't anything that I could live with. I used the only application I know of, but it didn't work. The only bootloader that I could install was the Windows 7 one, since that was the latest. I had no problem with the Windows 7 bootloader, but the Ubuntu wouldn't boot. When I tried selecting my Toshiba as my temporary boot device, it just went back to the menu to select a temporary boot device almost immediately. \nI need some way to get rid of the GRUB Bootloader while being able to boot to my Toshiba Ubuntu Hard Drive.\nThanks,\nSwagMasterIV\nP.S. I use a ThinkPad T540p laptop, if that info is any useful.\n\nA: The usual way used to install to an external drive is to put grub on that drive too, and change the boot-order in BIOS to boot the (USB) drive before the internal hard disk.  That way, nothing needs to be written to the internal hard disk, and without the external drive, the internal (Windows) boot happens.  legacy allows only one bootloader, which is started from the Master Boot Block, and yes, on one disk, the Windows bootloader will be overwritten. But on a two disk system, this should not happen if you specify the location for the bootloader as the external disk (but you might have run the install with the location pointing to the internal disk).  Since you can run Ubuntu, install grub to the external disk now (before you replace grub on the internal disk with the Windows bootloader).   \nThere are lots of answers on how to replace the Windows bootloader -- if you have the Windows install media (and not the vendor recovery junk).  Without that, it is possible if you have a FAT partition on the internal disk to just install the grub files there.  You make a directory \"boot\" and give grub-install that as the --boot-directory.\nYou have show that grub can boot your windows so that should be enough.  \nUEFI on newer machines (and my Thinkpad W520 allows a choice in the BIOS, so I assume your T540 does too) allows for multiple bootloaders. Wonderful, nothing should get overwritten, but the Ubuntu install ignores the bootloader location and just puts the ubuntu bootloaders on the internal disk's EFI partition, alongside the Windows bootloaders.  Oh well, you need an EFI partiton on the external disk, copy the internal disk's EFI files, then since the external disk is \"removable\", there is a default bootloader which is used and probably isn't set up right, so just copy the files in /EFI/ubuntu to /EFI/Boot and rename the shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi.\nThe other thing might be a change of the internal boot paths, but that can be reset with efibootmgr, and you might not even be using UEFI anyway. \n", "Q: this device is using an alternative driver[GeForce GT 630M ] Here is the screenshot of the additional drivers:\n\nI want to use NVIDIA driver so that I can use tensorflow GPU version on my pc.

However, netCDF4 can be found on PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4).\nInstead of using sudo pip to install Python packages at the system level, I recommend installing them via pip in a virtualenv. First, install virtualenv using apt-get. Second, create a virtualenv and activate it. Last, use pip to install netCDF4. The code to do so is given by:\nsudo apt-update && sudo apt-get install virtualenv\ncd ~/<desired directory>\nvirtualenv venv -p python3\nsource venv/bin/activate\npip install -U pip\npip install netCDF4\n\nReplace <desired directory> with where you want to create the virtualenv.\n", "Q: App to shrink Windows partition on WinXP I have a WinXP machine that I'd like to make dual-boot with Lubuntu.  The standard advice is to shrink the Windows partition from within Windows as Windows is fussy.\nThe problems I'm running into are this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlike Win7, WinXP doesn't have an internal utility for shrinking the Win partition.\n\n*The main third-party program that I see recommended -- EaseUS -- is riddled with malware/spyware.\n\n*GParted is a good program, but it doesn't meet the criteria of being a Windows program used to shrink Windows from within Windows.   \nSo, what partitioning program should I be using within Windows?\nUPDATE:   Success.

I run some KDE applications on Ubuntu 16.04 Unity, such as KDE Connect. \nI seem to be missing some packages that provide button icons:\n\n\nDoes anyone know which packages to install to have these buttons being shown correctly?\n\nA: As JonasCz pointed out, you need to install oxygen-icon-theme. But it's not enough to have installed, you also have to use it.\nOne way of doing this is to install Unity Tweak Tool:\nsudo apt install unity-tweak-tool\n\nRun it, go to Appearance / Icons and choose \"Oxygen\" instead of \"Ubuntu-mono-dark\" or whatever your current theme is. Then open the KDE Connect window again and it should have the icons.\nFurther options\nIf you don't like the Oxygen theme you can try another one. KDE Connect is not tied to Oxygen. What you need is a theme with specific icon names. For example, the button from your first screenshot needs an icon named edit-rename (see the reference in the source code):\n<iconset theme=\"edit-rename\">\n\nYou can search on your computer for icon themes containing such an icon:\nfind /usr/share/icons -name 'edit-rename*'\n\nYou could also search for available packages containing the icon:\napt-file find edit-rename.png\n\nOr maybe you could even modify your current theme and create links with the desired names to the existing icons (I haven't tried this).\n\nA: Instead of totally switching to a kde-theme it may be preferred to keep your preferred theme but set a fallback. In\n~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini  or for all users\n/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini  set the fallback-theme to an installed kde one:\n[Settings]\ngtk-fallback-icon-theme=breeze\n\nThe fallback theme can also be set using systemsettings5 in Gnome application style but I recommend against it as it also creates a ~/.gtkrc-2.0 which may corrupt your font settings.\n\n", "Q: General Input Output Error while using Google Drive I just upgraded to LibrOffice 5.1.3.

I want to remove Windows 7 completely and install Ubuntu.\nHow do I install it and is there any issue over installing Ubuntu after removing Windows 7?\n\nA: You don't need to remove Windows 7. During the installation you will be prompted, if you want to remove it.\nSimply download the iso of Ubuntu (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 desktop from here http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/). Then you can burn it to DVD or make liveUSB (How to create liveUSB on WINDOWS http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows).\nThen just restart your computer and boot form DVD/USB.\nYou will be prompted if you want to install Ubuntu alongside your current OS, or to erase whole disk and install Ubuntu. You want the second opinion. Warning, this will delete every single file from your Windows installation.\nThen just follow the on-screen instruction to finish the installation process. \nEnjoy Ubuntu and welcome to the community! :)\n", "Q: what does this activity represents - looking in syslog, kernlog & ufw log I just noticed that my syslog, kern log & ufw log have similar enteries, all are filled with blocking IP addresses, here I am only putting some lines from syslog.

I am running Ubuntu 14.04.2 and I want to format my disk for another operating system (Windows 10).\nMy desire to do this stems from a recent problem I have been having with installing the new OS. I try to boot from a live DVD (which I have confirmed is working), but my computer does enter the Windows 10 installation setup.\nSo, I am hoping that completely wiping the disk will solve this issue. Ideally, I want to do this with my only resources being Ubuntu and an internet connection. I can't connect the hard drive to another computer, and it would be difficult for me to have to burn a disc for any reason.\nThank you.\n\nA: Try to make a bootable CD or pendrive of Ubuntu and then choose Try Ubuntu option. That is try to run live ubuntu and then using GParted (Which is in-built) try to format the partition in which your other OS is.\n\nA: To format your drive you want to boot up yur system using either a Ubuntu live cd/pendrive or a Gparted live cd/pendrive\nYou can get the Gparted iso file from here: http://gparted.org/liveusb.php#linux-method-c\nUse Unetbootin to create a pendrive to boot up from.\nYou can install Unetbootin with the following command:\n\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nYou can also use the Ubuntu's Startup disk creator, but I have found Unetbootin to be more reliable for me.\nWhen you have created your pendrive, reboot your computer. Remember to change the boot priority under the BIOS settings so that the usb is booted first.\nIf you chose Ubuntu as your OS to boot up from, select try Ubuntu and then under the search bar look for Gparted and run it. It will show all your installed drives. From there you can just right click and select format. Execute the operation and Gparted will format the drive. For Windows the new partition format should be NFTS.\nIf you used the Gparted iso to boot from, the process is basically the same. \n", "Q: sudo problem.

I haven't installed gksu. so i tried to install it but it asked again sudo password and the only thing that i could do was press enter.\nMy problem is that how do you write your password on terminal.   \n\nA: Instead of doing su root, you should use sudo instead, as the root account is not enabled by default in Ubuntu, and will not work. This is why you are getting an \"Authentication failure\" message.\n\nRegarding password entry - it won't show you anything as you type, but, it will accept your password after you press enter. Make sure you entered the right password.\nThis is a security feature so that someone looking over your shoulder doesn't know how many characters your password has.\n", "Q: Black screen, no access to terminal - should I just reinstall ubuntu Yesterday I downloaded the recommended updates. I then downloaded Minecraft, which meant downloading a Java package and changing a Nvidia setting. As per instructions I performed a shutdown/startup on my Dell Inspiron. It initially opened and I was able to play Minecraft. However, after shutting down have been unable to boot the laptop since. I get a back lit black screen followed by the purple screen, more black with flashing cursor and then the Ubuntu start screen. Then a whole load of commands rush past and we end on a black screen proper. And there we sit. I know something is happening in the background as fans are operating. No matter what configuration of keys I press during the abortive start up, I cannot access the terminal to attempt a repair. I have seen many with questions but no definitive answer. So, I'm seriously tinkering with the idea of just saying bollocks to it all and doing a clean install. Before I lose all data and settings, has anyone got any good news and doesn't require a PhD in IT to execute. Hope everyone is having a better day than me. Cheers.\n\nA: If this is solely about good news, since this is Ubuntu we're talking about a clean install while keeping all your files is possible (though I would still recommend backing up your data before a clean install).\nTo do this, boot up the computer using an Ubuntu Live CD (or USB) but don't install anything. Instead open up the folder manager and your partition where your home directory is should be there.\nIf your home directory is encrypted here's how you do it:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116297/how-to-recover-an-encrypted-home-directory-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: Solved, but kudos to Thanos and Joe.\nNot the ideal solution, as I will have to set everything up again and backup data from ext HD. However, it did fix the problem. \nFirstly, I performed a clean install of Ubuntu, effectively wiping the HD.\nNext I went back to the original help file at 'How to geek'. This time, however, I did not mess with the driver settings for the NVIDIA. I did download 'openjkd'. After that I just downloaded the Minecraft.jar, following the 'How to geek' guide.\nOpened Minecraft and played for minute before closing and shutting down. On start up everything booted without a problem.\nI can only conclude that changing driver settings caused the black screen issue.\n", "Q: Hindi display of words such as \"pra\" \"gra\" Words such as (pran) -  प्राण, (grameen) - ग्रामीण are incorrect when compared with traditional hindi writing.

This partition contains a 'Boot' folder which contains BCD files and a whole wack of langauage folders. THIS IS The FOLDER THAT WINDOWS BOOTLOADER uses.\n/dev/sdb4 - 121.53 ntfs partition containing storage for media\n\ndev/sdd - Ubuntu Drive\ndev/sdd1 - 512 MB partition containing a 'EFI' folder, inside of which are two folders 'grub' and 'Ubuntu', both of which contain the exact same files (grub.cfg, grubx64.efi, MokManager.efi, shium64.efi)\ndev/sdd2 - 48.83 GB ext4 partition that contains the '/' folder and Ubuntu instalation. \ndev/sdd3 - 69.91 GB ntfs partition containing storage for media\nwhat do I need to do so that the Grub shell I am being dropped into will load up Ubuntu? HOw can I get this machine to dual boot out of Grub?\n\nA: You have two options - using the GRUB boot loader (what I recommend) or the Windows loader. First remove all the Ubuntu or GRUB entries you had created in the Windows BCD store before. To list all identifiers open command prompt as administrator, execute : bcdedit /enum all /v \nTo delete the Ubuntu entries execute : bcdedit /delete {*} for each Ubuntu entry you have. Replace * with the Ubuntu identifier to delete - be careful and don't delete the Windows entry. Additionally I recommend to uninstall EasyBCD to avoid further problems with BCD operations.  \nMethod 1 : GRUB boot loader\nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media and select Try Ubuntu without installing, once on the Live desktop open GParted to identify the disk and partitions where the operating systems are installed. In most cases the disk is sda, the Windows partition on msdos partition table sda1.  \nNow install the GRUB boot loader from which you can boot Ubuntu and Windows to the disk in Legacy BIOS (msdos partition table) mode - so open a terminal and execute these commands :  \nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt  \nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sd*\n\nReplace sd* (disk) and sd** (Ubuntu partition) with the letters and number you've identified.  \nIn case the systems are installed in UEFI BIOS mode ... install the GRUB boot loader in EFI mode. \nsudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt/boot/efi\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\nsudo chroot /mnt\ngrub-install /dev/sd*\nupdate-grub  \n\nReplace sd* (disk), sd** (efi partition), sd*** (Ubuntu partition) with what you've identified. \nBoot into BIOS and change the boot order in UEFI settings - select Ubuntu to be the default OS.  \nMethod 2 : Windows boot loader \nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media and select Try Ubuntu without installing, once on the Live desktop open GParted to identify the disk and partitions where the operating systems are installed. In most cases the disk is sda, the Windows partition on msdos partition table sda1.\nFirst mount the Windows partition, open a terminal, execute : sudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\nReplace sd*** (Windows partition) with the letters and number you have  identified before.  \nCopy the first 512 bytes of Ubuntu : dd if=/dev/sd** of=/mnt/linux.bin bs=512 count=1\nReplace sd** (Ubuntu partition) with the letters and number you've had  identified before.\nBoot into Windows, open command prompt as administrator and execute these commands :  \nbcdedit /create /d Ubuntu /application bootsector\nbcdedit /set {identifier} device partition=c:\nbcdedit /set {identifier} path \\linux.bin\nbcdedit /displayorder {identifier} /addlast  \nbcdedit /timeout X  \n\nReplace \"identifier\" with the characters, letters and numbers being returned when you executed the first command and replace \"X\" with the number of seconds (for instance 10) you want to see the Windows boot loader menu - before it automatically will boot the default operating system.\n\nA: I was finally able to get grub2 to load at startup with a Windows 7 entry however it took a lot of trial and error.\nWhat I did was remove all Grub entries from all the different locations that it had been installed on the numerous drives, and then remove all of the EasyBcd Grub entries.  \nAfter this I booted into Boot repair Disk and restored the MBR  to allow Windows to boot normally, rebooted back into Boot Disk Repair, and then reinstalled Grub2 (on all drives). I then went into my BIOS, changed boot Disk and  booted into Ubuntu and typed sudo update-grub \nit was only after performing this command that Windows was recognised in the Grub2 bootloader.  It did not end here though because Windows Bootloader was still coming up after choosing Windows in the Grub2 menu (essentially adding another step), so I used EasyBCD to disable the Windows bootloader menu so that Grub simply loads straight into Windows without waiting for input from the WIndows bootloader.\nI was then able to change the boot order in Grub2 with grub-customizer\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nI am going to reward the bounty to the first answer as it was the only answer, and also I am happy that the author took time to be thorough in their explanation. \n", "Q: How to remove nodejs from Ubuntu 16.04?

Then do a\nsudo apt-get update\nCheck for any .npm or .node folder in your home folder and delete those.\nIf you type\nwhich node\nyou can see the location of the node. Try which nodejs and which npm too.\nI would recommend installing node using Node Version Manager(NVM). That saved a lot of head ache for me. Because you can install nodejs and npm without sudo using nvm.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Terminal - gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘--showme:link’ I am not trying to install anything.

But the interesting thing is that file does not directly call gcc but it sources so many other files, it really hard to get to the specific file/line that is causing this issue.\nInstead, as an trial and error method (and also being confident that this should be the problematic one), you can comment out the line from ~/.bashrc:\n# source /opt/openfoam30/etc/bashrc\n\nAnd as per your comment, it worked !!

It should also work in your case. To undo this you can run \nsudo apt-mark unhold <package_name>\n\nIt probably isnt a good idea to prevent packages from updating. New updates could include security fixes or bug fixes. Preventing these upgrades could be harmful for you system. Also as Pilot6 said in the comments, not upgrading the packages could prevent the applications from working altogethor. so be cautious when you decide to hold packages from upgrades.\n", "Q: Install android-sdk from official packages I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 and trying to set up a cordova build environment.\nI need Android-SDK for building locally android apps (only the sdk, not android studio). Since 16.04 there are the packages android and android-sdk in the official Ubuntu repositories. I installed both but couldn't manage to get it work. Are these packages not enough? Where is the android binary? I could install this via getting the packages with wget from google, but getting updates via apt is much nicer.\nIsn't this possible?\n\nA: I've tried that package as well, same result.\nI suspect the SDK-Manager is not included on purpose though.\nIf you think about it, the SDK-Manager does update stuff like platform-tools and build-tools, and those are provided (and thus updated) by the package via apt.\nSo I guess the package is intended to be used as-is, without the SDK-Manager so the user cannot mess things up.\nFor what it's worth, using the package does not make sense for me, and I'll stick to the old-fashioned way, e.g. manual download and installation of the SDK. Mainly because I prefer fine-grained control over the SDK.\n", "Q: How DisplayLink will be treated in Ubuntu 16.04 (fb ov display device?) I'm trying to hookup 3 external monitors (3 * 1920* 1080) to my Dell XPS 15 (9550).\nI thought that it will go with Matrox TrippleHead2Go DP edition by means of Thunderbolt port.\nNo way - Matrox is able to provide me with 5760 * 1080 \"screen\", but is is seen as Display device (creen) and not a Video card (/dev/fbX). My Intel and Nvidia (!) cards are not able to do more then 3840 * 2160 digital resolution. So I used 2 monitors with Matrox and have to find a way to hookup another one.\nThe issue here is that TrippleHead2Go is seen form Ubuntu as a Display, not a video card (fb device). So as this large screen get's attached to internal card as a DisplayPort transported over Thunderbolt, neither Nvidia, nor Intel are capable to handle it. So the only way to have 3* 1920 is to introduce additional video card to the system (/dev/fb1).\nI knew that there are USB3 DisplayLink enabled adapters, but in my case the question is:\nWill Ubuntu 16.04 treat DisplayLink as a video card or as a display? \nI found out lsusb output, but could not find any info regarding the way system is treating the adapter. I saw some notes regarding /dev/fb1, but am not sure.\nP.S. I am aware of so called Graphic boxes - an external device with PCIe and Thunderbolt connection where you can place additional video card of your choice. But I am not sure I really want to go that way even as it is most correct one in therms of performance.\n\nA: Ok. So basically the answer is simple: it depends on the hardware on the other end of DisplayLink cable.\nIf device being attached to DisplayLink port identify itself as a display, than Linux will treat it as a display (physical monitor device to be precise).\nIf device being attached to DisplayLink port identify itself as a Video card than Linux will treat it as a video processing hardware.\nThere are many thing that can be attached to DisplayLink and in such case DL will play only a transport role.\nWhat about my own question:\nMatrox TrippleHead2Go DP edition present itself as a display device (monitor). Configurable firmware in the appliance will define resolution of such a \"virtual\" device for Linux on one hand and will split image across several physical monitors to match such presentation on another.\n", "Q: Unity problem? missing launch bar and severe flickering of windows/icons what works:\n- background wallpaper is shown correctly\n- mouse seems to behave normally\n\nwhat doesn't work:\n- none of the launch bars is visible\n- desktop icons flicker between their correct position and\n  a place just a bit to the left and down\n- open windows flicker, moving down a bit each time\n  upon hitting the bottom monitor border, they stop moving but continue flickering\n- right-click menu is placed correctly but briefly turns invisible while flicker occurs\n- all flickering seems to occur in a one second interval\n\nSystem:\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (freshly installed on previously blank drive)\n- Processor: Intel i7-6700K\n- Graphics: NVidia GTX970\n- Mainboard: MSI Z170A\n\nThe PC has no network connection right now, so i am unable to download/install packages...\nIf any other information is useful, please say so.\n\nA: After some research I found out, that I fell victim to the following bug:\nbugs.launchpad.net->llvm-toolchain-bug\nSummarized: The version of the package libllvm3.8 which is distributed with Ubuntu 16.04 crashes on certain mixes of NVidia GPUs and Skylake CPUs. This is already fixed for later versions of the package.\nTherefore a simple update as done below should fix the problem in 99% of cases.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Did you ever figure out what the problem was? This exact behavior just started happening to me since the latest update on 16.04. I don't know if this helps, but going through \n\n/var/log/apt/history.log\n\nit seems that the latest update (which caused the problem) changed the following packages\nsnapd\ngnome-shell-common\nlibnm-gtk-common\nnetwork-manager-gnome\nlibnma0\nlibnma-common\nlibnm-gtk0\n\nSo I guess that one of these is causing the problem. I'll try reverting to a previous version for each of these packages one by one to see if it helps. \nHope you sorted it out on your end, if not I hope that this may help you...\nHave a good one!\n\nA: I've been getting this and I figure it might be related to this bug especially since someone commented \"This appears to happen after xscreensaver runs, but only some times. I don't see any pattern to which times.\" and it happened to me after the screensaver had run I think.\nRestarting unity by pressing Alt+F2 then typing unity then Enter fixed the flicker temporarily, but this is only slightly better than rebooting, as it closes all open windows.\n", "Q: Make terminal app not stop applications when losing focus In Ubuntu touch terminal, when you run a command line application like vim or a long running shell script and you switch away to another app, the running application is stopped (like ctrl+z).\nThis is even more annoying when your application comes back but the terminall is messed up.

That script might be a server.\n\nA: You can change terminal lifecycle by running these command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out which apps are supposed not to be suspended:\ngsettings get com.canonical.qtmir lifecycle-exempt-appids\n\nFor me this command returns ['com.ubuntu.music']\n\n*Add terminal app to this list\ngsettings set com.canonical.qtmir lifecycle-exempt-appids \"['com.ubuntu.music', 'com.ubuntu.terminal']\"\n\nNow terminal shouldn't be stopped anymore.\nThis solution from \"VLC running in the Terminal App on Ubuntu Touch has play/pause/skip controls in the sound indicator\" on reddit.\n\nA: Thanks to Daniel for the pointer.\nThe answer is:\nGo to open.uappexplorer.com and download the openstore click package and install it.\nIf you cannot find your new open store app restart or search for it the apps scope.\nFrom open store app install UT Tweak Tool.\nAgain, if the app is not in the scope, then search for it, restart or you can install an app from the normal app store. (this looks like a minor bug that the apps scope is not refreshed)\nIn UT Tweak Tool, go in the upper left menu and choose \"apps scopes\".

When I'm playing some games like chivalry Medieval Warfare and I switch to another software like Firefox or Desktop the sound of the game still plays.\nSo, How can I fix this problem ?\n\nA: (Automatically) mute sound of a specific application if its window is not in front\nI tested the script below on Rhythmbox, doing the job without a single error. \nRunning the script below in the background will pause the targeted process if its window is not in front (within one second), muting sound if it comes with the application. \nWhenever the window gets in front again, the process is resumed where it was, and sound works again.\nIf the targeted process/application does not run at all, the script switches to a longer period (mode), checking only once per five seconds if the targeted application runs or not. This way, the script is extremely low on juice if it has no job to fulfill. \nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# ---set the proc to pause when not the active window\nwclass = \"rhythmbox\"\n# ---\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    # just a helper function to not repeat verbose subprocess sections\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\nwhile True:\n    # the longer period: application is not running (saving fuel)\n    time.sleep(5)\n    front1 = \"\"\n    while True:\n        # if the application runs, switch to a shorter response time\n        time.sleep(1)\n        # get the possible pid, get() returns \"None\" if not running,\n        # script then switches back to 5 sec check\n        pid = get([\"pgrep\", wclass])\n        if pid:\n            front2 = wclass in get([\n                \"xprop\", \"-id\", get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\"])\n                ])\n            # run either kill -stop or kill -cont only if there is\n            # a change in the situation\n            if front2 != front1:\n                if front2 == True:\n                    cm = [\"kill\", \"-cont\", pid]\n                    print(\"run\") # just a test indicator, remove afterwards\n                else:\n                    cm = [\"kill\", \"-stop\", pid]\n                    print(\"stop\") # just a test indicator, remove afterwards\n                subprocess.Popen(cm)\n            front1 = front2\n        else:\n            break\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool to get information on the frontmost window:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as pause_app.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the process name to pause (replace rhythmbox). \nUsually this is the same as the (first section of) the WM_CLASS, but in your case, I am having doubts if this should not be steam or something else. Run to make sure \nps -u <yourname>\n\nto make an educated guess, and subsequently \nkill <pid> \n(the process id)\n\nto check.\n\n*Run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/pause_app.py\n\nand check if all works as expected.\n\n*If all works fine, add to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Then add the command: \npython3 /path/to/pause_app.py\n\nNote\nThe script can be easily edited to target multiple applications, but first please see if this is what you need.\nAlternatively\nIf you'd prefer to mute the sound in general once the targeted window is not in front, replace the command to pause the application by the command to mute (/unmute) sound. The script then becomes:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# ---set the proc to pause when not the active window\nwclass = \"rhythmbox\"\n# ---\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    # just a helper function to not repeat verbose subprocess sections\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\nwhile True:\n    # the longer period: application is not running (saving fuel)\n    time.sleep(5)\n    front1 = \"\"\n    while True:\n        # if the application runs, switch to a shorter response time\n        time.sleep(1)\n        # get the possible pid, get() returns \"None\" if not running,\n        # script then switches back to 5 sec check\n        pid = get([\"pgrep\", wclass])\n        if pid:\n            front2 = wclass in get([\n                \"xprop\", \"-id\", get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\"])\n                ])\n            # run either kill -stop or kill -cont only if there is\n            # a change in the situation\n            if front2 != front1:\n                if front2 == True:\n                    cm = [\"amixer\", \"-q\", \"-D\", \"pulse\", \"sset\", \"Master\", \"on\"]\n                    print(\"sound\") # just a test indicator, remove afterwards\n                else:\n                    cm = [\"amixer\", \"-q\", \"-D\", \"pulse\", \"sset\", \"Master\", \"off\"]\n                    print(\"no sound\") # just a test indicator, remove afterwards\n                subprocess.Popen(cm)\n            front1 = front2\n        else:\n            break\n\nUsage is exactly similar to the first script.\n\nA: The script bellow relies on all native tools of Ubuntu, pactl and qdbus to determine active app, automatically mute and unmute as the app gains and focus from user.\nThe app name is set in APP_ICON_NAME variable.

The version of your Node.js in the repositories is 4.2.6 and the npm version 3.5.2. This will not be the latest version, but it should be quite stable.\nIn order to get the newest version of Node.js, you just have to use the apt package manager. You should refresh your local package index prior and then install from the repositories:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nIf the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all that you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you'll also want to also install npm, which is the Node.js package manager. You can do this by typing:\nsudo apt-get install npm\n\nThis will allow you to easily install modules and packages to use with Node.js.\nHelpful resources\n\n\n*\n\n*https://duckduckgo.com/?q=install+node.js+on+ubuntu\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16302436/install-node-js-on-ubuntu-12-10\n\n*https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server\n\n*https://www.elastichosts.com/blog/how-to-install-nodejs-on-ubuntu/\n\n*http://davidtsadler.com/archives/2012/05/06/installing-node-js-on-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Shorter way to apt-get install php7.0-{some modules} I am currently installing php7.0 and was wondering if there is an shorter way to install the modules. normally I type:\n    apt-get install php7.0 php7.0-fpm php7.0-mbstring php7.0-mcrypt \n     php7.0-phpdbg php7.0-dev php7.0-curl php7.0-sqlite3 php7.0-json \n     php7.0-gd php7.0-cli\n\nIs there an regular expression so you don't have to type php7.0 over and over again?

The format is almost what you already tried: braces but a comma-separated list:\n$ echo foo{a,b,c}\nfooa foob fooc\n\nTherefore:\n$ echo php7.0-{fpm,mbstring,mcrypt,phpdbg,dev,curl,sqlite3,json,gd,cli}\nphp7.0-fpm php7.0-mbstring php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-phpdbg php7.0-dev php7.0-curl php7.0-sqlite3 php7.0-json php7.0-gd php7.0-cli\n\nSo, you could run:\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-{fpm,mbstring,mcrypt,phpdbg,dev,curl,sqlite3,json,gd,cli}\n\n", "Q: Error in Caffe Installation in Ubuntu 16.04 While compiling Caffe in Ubuntu 16.04, I got the following error:\nLD -o .build_release/lib/libcaffe.so.1.0.0-rc3  \n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lhdf5_hl  \n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lhdf5  \ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status  \nMakefile:563: recipe for target '.build_release/lib/libcaffe.so.1.0.0-rc3' failed  \nmake: *** [.build_release/lib/libcaffe.so.1.0.0-rc3] Error 1\n\nPlease suggest a way to successfully install caffe by removing this error?\n\nA: This worked for me, \nin 'Makefile.config'\nchange line 94 and 95 to\nLINE 94: INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include  /usr/include/hdf5/serial\nLINE 95: LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial\n", "Q: Why is the Ubuntu Touch browser reloading the web pages each time I select the tab?

Now I got to know that an IDE of GNUStep called ProjectCenter also got installed along with that environment.\nBut ProjectCenter is not working properly. All the features of the Objective C Programming Environment are working properly except ProjectCenter.\nWhen I open ProjectCenter, an application named Log opens up. I also get a dialog box in Log containing options like PC, Info, Project, File, Hide, Quit. Only two options \"Hide\" and \"Quit\" are working. \nI don't want to reinstall the whole environment. Reinstalling ProjectCenter from Ubuntu Software doesn't seem to resolve the issue. So suggest me a method to resolve this issue! \n\nA: What you describe is the correct behaviour of ProjectCenter and other GNUstep apps, though that probably comes as a surprise when you're used to other environments like Unity. Many applications based on other systems will open a blank document or a wizard when you launch them, but often GNUstep applications do not. They're designed to just start, then wait for you to tell them what to do.\nThe thing you call a dialog with File, Project etc. is a menu, like the menu bar that goes across the top of the screen or the window in other applications. You should find that clicking on Project brings up a sub-menu, which includes \"New...\", and clicking on that lets you create a new project where you can write your Objective-C.\nThe GNUstep documentation is here, unfortunately the link to the user experience guide isn't working.\n", "Q: Can't install php 5.4 on Ubuntu Server 16.04 I'm trying to install php5.4 but i can't find it in the packages, I added also paa or ppa repository and nothing...

You should upgrade your script the latest supported PHP version.  At the time of writing this, the recommended version is at least PHP 5.6 that will be supported until 31. December 2018.\nRunning unsupported version of PHP is strongly discouraged as the obsolete version have or will have security vulnerabilities.  The aforementioned PPA is kept only for historic reasons and I will not produce any new builds of PHP 5.4 for any Ubuntu version.\nYou can still use it to install latest PHP 5.4 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but again it's strongly discouraged to do so.

I tried to install it on a ubuntu in a virtualbox, but did not see my old snapshots, even when I pointed it to my old snapshot location.\nCan someone please help to get my data back?\n\nA: Old versions of BackInTime (< 1.1.0) where a bit tricky if you want to restore files on a different machine (with different host/user name). Please install the current version from our PPA. This is much more user friendly. It comes with a restore function for the config and won't need to trick the host/user name anymore.\nOpen a Terminal with CTRL+ALT+T and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bit-team/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install backintime-qt4\n\nNow you can either restore the old config with the Restore Config button in Settings or just delete the current config (rm ~/.config/backintime/config in Terminal).

For some reason the kernel was finding an \"asus\" WiFi module in addition (and prior to) the correct Intel module.

If I disable UEFI and Secure Boot, then it will install, but does not see the Windows 10 OS. That is not an acceptable option since I want a dual boot system. If I try to boot in UEFI mode with Secure Boot on, then the system will not boot from the CD. Has anyone figured out how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I am actually quite new to Linux, so will try to explain my installation procedure that worked for me in detail, however be careful while following these instructions because i am still new to the system, and tried this procedure using trial and error. I think the actual problem for these errors are, because we are using the instruction from blogs that were created for the older versions, and haven't been updated properly since then. OK, so I will help you through the update process for the current versions (date: 27/Nov/2018). I will be explaining in detail about installing the Linux 18.04 LTS on the Dell 7559 PC with NVIDIA 960M and Intel i7 - inlet HD graphics 530 (I think this should work for 16.04LTS as well.)\nStep 1: First make sure how you want to go along installing the system. \n\n1.As a stand alone operating system 2.Dual boot with windows (in case dual boot-use windows to make a partition for Ubuntu - around 30gb). 3.Make a boot-able USB drive containing the Ubuntu OS.\n\nStep 2: Start your PC and press F2 during Boot, and disable secure boot* (very important - as the secure boot wont let Ubuntu install it's drivers), it advised to use UEFI over Legacy since it is more smooth and easy to access. \nShould I install Ubuntu as UEFI or Legacy?\nIs it safe to disable Secure Boot?\nStep 3: Boot using the boot able USB ( press F12 during boot to access the USB drive). \nStep 4:Once on the Grub menu page go to the \"install Ubuntu\" option and press e. Now you have accessed the boot parameters,here find the command/line where \"quiet splash\" \n\n(linux           /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-20-generic root=UUID=6500f497e670-460c-977b-8fad43155f12 r0 quiet splash $vt_handoff) ,    \n\nadd nomodeset before quiet splashit  \n\n(linux           /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-20-generic root=UUID=6500f497e670-460c-977b-8fad43155f12 r0 nomodeset quiet splash $vt_handoff). \n\nNow press Ctrl X or F10 to boot grub from the updated boot\nparameters.  \nStep 5: Now you have entered the installation GUI for Ubuntu, here follow the prompts, but is is advised not to connect to the WiFi to update, that can be done later. In the installation menu opt for Something else- to partition the hard drive by yourself. (Dual Boot: If you are going to dual boot with windows then,  use the partition made from Step 1: )\n \n\nNow, here you would have to divide the partition into four parts. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Let the first partition be around 10gb-20gb (this amount of memory is required if you are going to use the system as machine learning environment to install the CUDA file, or else file allocation can be performed manually) for the Ubuntu files drivers and programs. Choose system type as ext4 and mount point /.\n  \n*Now allocate around 250MB for EFI Partition (system type)\n  \n*Finally allocate the remaining memory for /home\n(note-make sure the windows partition is not tampered with!)*\n  \n*Continue Installation and reboot once the installation is over.\n  \n\nStep 6: After the Reboot make sure you boot into the UEFI boot option ubuntu, press Esc or Shiftduring boot to enter grub, once in the grub menu follow Step 4. (note-failing to do as mentioned in this step, will cause the system to hang, or get into a login loop, after the login into the Linux system is attempted)\nStep 7: Once you have entered the system, open terminal and run commands sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade. Once these two steps have been performed go to software-update application to perform auto-update by the Ubuntu system.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Now to update the grub boot parameters permanently to solve brightness and other issues, we have to enter the grub file located at /etc/default/grub and edit it using: sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nhere edit the parameters to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=\" once done -Ctrl o Ctrl x (if you want to disable nvidia drivers loading permanently in the initial steps then follow - How do I set 'nomodeset' after I've already installed Ubuntu?)\n\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n\nStep 8: Type sudo reboot in the terminal. During reboot repeat Step 6.\nNow the system is setup, but is not yet ready  to use Nvidia. To start using Nvidia we would have to first install the propriety driver using:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa \nsudo apt update\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Now, do not update graphic drivers via the terminal, instead search for Software & Updates in the Ubuntu GUI. here go to the additional drivers tab. Here you will find the set of NVIDIA drivers for your system. select the nvidia-drivers-415 i think that one is the latest.

I have a Compaq V5205 with 1.46g celeron CPU. I am relatively happy with the performance as I mostly just check email and browse the internet. However, sometimes the system slows to a crawl. I launched system monitor and noticed the phyton  was using 100% of the cpu! Python stopped just as I saw what was happening so I didn't get any more info.\n\nA: Long Answer\nThe General Python FAQ states:\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.\n\n\nIn this context, there are 3 important facets: (Bolded)\n\n\n*\n\n*An interpreted language is a programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.\n\n*Interactive programming is the procedure of writing parts of a program while it is already active. This focuses on the program text as the main interface for a running process, rather than an interactive application, where the program is designed in development cycles and used thereafter (usually by a so-called \"user\", in distinction to the \"developer\"). Consequently, here, the activity of writing a program becomes part of the program itself.\n\n*Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type.\n\n\nWhy This is Important\nAll Linux'es main method of doing things, irrespective of the Window or Desktop Environment is the terminal, commonly called the TTY.  Since the main method of input into the TTY is the keyboard, scripting became the main method of automating things, and while there are plenty of native scripting tools on Linux, like Awk/gAwk and Sed, some like Awk and Sed, are sometimes challenging for beginning scriptors, and challenging syntactically for even experts.\nSince Python is a scripting language, it can be used in place of the tedious tools like those I noted.  The OOP part comes in handy, as I can use the methods of the language, instead of having to write sed or awk snippets over and over again. And that is what most modern Linux'es have done to ease development, and scripting among developers.  One of your programs is using some python script, and is hung.\n\nShort Answer\nKnowing that python is a scripting language means that @mikewhatever and I are correct in telling you that your system is running a program that is invoking a python script, and the script is taking a long time to execute or is hung. Tools like top, htop, and system monitor will tell you the name of the running script, and possibly the parent program that invoked the script.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I do not currently have the ability to comment on this Stack Exchange site, but I will attempt to make this answer more complete than a comment. (I would recommend accepting eyoung100's detailed answer.)\nPython is a scripting language that is used in many programs. When you see \"python\" in the process list, it is actually the python interpreter running a different program, in the same way as running a .JAR file would be displayed as \"java\".\nThe most notable program I notice that runs on python is playonlinux. Whenever I start playonlinux, both \"playonlinux\" and \"python\" appear in the system monitor, however they do not use very much of the CPU. The same would probably apply to most other programs that rely on Python, so you may want to check if any of your programs may possibly use the language.\n", "Q: I can't update or remove java 10.67.2 plugin in firefox 47.0 When I click on (plugin) update now it is blocked and I am re-directed to the update now button to update Java.\nI updated Java to version 8 update 91.

Any help would be appreciated - I'm no expert, but it seems to me like the new kernel just isn't seeing the encrypted filesystems at boot time. \nFor both systems, I used the installer to encrypt the boot drive.

Reboot and now it works ok. \n\nA: I had a similar problem except my /etc/crypttab was completely missing.  Recently I'd upgraded my mechanical hard drive to a SSD.  On both I have everything but /boot encrypted, and the boot process was working just fine.  Also, I checked a backup from a few weeks prior, and crypttab was there then.\nI followed the answer to this post to fix my problem.\nReinstall to existing encrypted partitions\nNote the comment re three of the mounts.  These are wrong and should be:\n# mount --bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev\n# mount --bind /sys /mnt/ubuntu/sys\n# mount -t proc none /mnt/ubuntu/proc\n\nAlso, note that the UUID in crypttab must be for the container that contains the LUKS volume (in my case /dev/sda5), not for the LUKS volume after is is decrypted.  (It says this, but I missed it the first time around, so I thought I'd point this out.)\nFinal note, gotta say that this poor behavior on the part of the updater - rendering the computer unbootable - is the kind of problem that keeps Linux from getting a wider audience among typical desktop users.\n", "Q: Error \"System is booting up.

I want to burn a code to my Arduino Uno. When uploading the code, there's an error message saying, Serial Port COM1 not fount found. Did you select the correct one from tools -> serial port menu?. Now, visiting the tools, I can't select serial port because it is disabled. I am attaching a screen-shot of how it looks. I have done something similar in windows. How to find the serial port on Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: As far I see you are using the version 1.0.5 of arduino IDE, I assume that you installed the one in the apt repositories.\nYou can either try to install one from the snapcraft or the one from arduino's website.\nPersonally I used the latter one and anything worked like a charm.\nAlso either the case you can try to loon on Tools->Port if exists a port that is not a /dev/ttyS0 one. Try to play with these options. Finally by searching on dmesg you can find out which port has been located for arduno as well.\nFinally an another approach is to unplug your arduino plug it again and type the following command:\ndmesg | tail\n\nIn order to record the last event as the one that happens when arduino is plugged in to a usb port. The command above will show you the correct port.\nFor better results you can use the following:\n  dmesg | tail -f\n\nAnd continioulsy plug and unplug the arduino from the usp port till you see any arduino related message. The -f parameter allows to show realtime the new logs.\n\nA: COM1 is a Windows(TM) designation - it will look like /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyUSB0 or similar in Linux.\nGreyed out port tends to mean you haven't set the board type first - go through the settings in arduino Tools menu & set board to 'Uno', you should see the 'port' enable & auto-fill as well, most likely.\n\nA: In my case this error was because in the newer versions of Ubuntu the built in braile reader (brltty) was grabbing the port.  I could see this when I used the command\nsudo dmesg | tail -f\n\nthis showed the tty being disconnected from the port\n[  771.927380] usb 2-1.1: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1\n[  771.928207] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0\nexplained very well here:\n/dev/ttyUSB0 not present in Ubuntu 22.04\nthe actual fix I applied was\nsudo apt remove brltty   (nb plug and replug the arduino afterwards)\n\n...as suggested by Jarosław Jaryszew in the thread above .. many thanks to him BTW\n\nA: Your user account probably doesn't have permission to use the serial port.\nTwo ways to address this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easiest, but not advised: Run the Arduino IDE as root (eg launch from the command line using sudo).\n\n*The second, more advisable way to do it is to add your user to the dialout group, which has permission to use the serial port. Use the command sudo adduser $USER dialout. You will need to log out then log back in for it to take effect though (or try this). To list groups of current user use groups or id -Gn.\n\n\nOnce this is done, when you select the correct serial port (as others have mentioned maybe /dev/ttyUSB0) you should be able to write, allowing you to program the Arduino.\n\nA: use this\nsudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0  \n\nor  \nsudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0\n\n\nA: For serial stuff I would actually recommend using something like minicom it's easy to use and you actually see the /dev/tty to which it is bound. It's usually something like /dev/ttyS0\nEdit: So it's not only a link answer dmesg | grep tty that's how you see which port your TTY is - see the link above for reference.\n\nA: I had this same problem and struggled to fix it for a while. I tried the usual suggestions about adding myself to the dialout group and was frustrated that none of those tips helped. In the end, I realized I was using a backrev version of the Arduino IDE software, and once I upgraded, the problem went away. \n", "Q: ssh key forwarding not working under i3wm I recently switched from the regular Lubuntu LXDE/openbox to the i3 window manager under Lubuntu 16.04.\nIn either environment I can ssh with authentication forwarding activated into another machine via a vpn tunnel using:\nssh -A user@remote-machineA\n\nOn my local machine I have a ssh key for a git repository on remote-machineB.

But I don't know what the missing piece is.\nI came across this: https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/4ho1qj/sshagent_within_i3wm_on_ubuntu_1604_does_not_work/\nBut unsure if this is the same problem as I experience, I tried the solutions proposed there but to no avail.\n\nA: Certain DE environments starts their own applications that can behave as a ssh-agent and that can be forwarded. But it is not probably the case for the i3. If you want to use \"ssh-agent forwarding\" (it is not \"authentication forwarding\" as you note), you need to have ssh-agent running and your keys loaded inside. You can verify that simply using command below. It should list your authentication keys\nssh-add -l\n\nIf it returns error, you need to start the agent first:\neval `ssh-agent`\n\nIf it does not list them, you need to add the keys to the agent:\nssh-add path/to/key\n\nIf you want to automate it, add these commands to your .bashrc (do not start new agent with every bash! Only if there is no ssh-agent connection yet). There is a lot of snippet you can use all over the internet.\n", "Q: Very slow wi-fi on Intel wireless 3165 i'm on ubuntu 16.04.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nFinally, I suggest that you install the latest firmware:\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_1.158_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-firmware*.deb\n\nReboot and your wireless should be working correctly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu is not sending SIGTERM on shutdown I am beginning to suspect that Ubuntu is not telling the running applications that it is shutting down to let them quit correctly but instead forces them to quit.\nIf I leave chrome open when shutting down it says that it did not close correctly last time when I open it again after boot, LibreOffice does not ask me if I want to save my document and I am making an application which needs to run some code on exit but is not allowed to do so when the computer is shut down.\nAs I have understood it, SIGTERM is first sent to all processes to allow them to exit cleanly and if they don't exit SIGKILL is sent to force them to quit. It seems that Ubuntu is either not sending SIGTERM at all or does not give the applications enough time before sending SIGKILL.\nIs there some way I can fix this?\nI am running Ubuntu 16.04 but the problem existed in 15.10 as well. I can't tell if it was there before since I started using Ubuntu when 15.10 was the newest version.\nEdit: I use Unity and shut down my computer by pressing the gear in the top right corner and selecting shut down, though the problem is the same if running sudo halt in the terminal.\nEdit: I am observing the same behavior when only logging out. My guess is that the signal is supposed to be sent on log out and therefore the problem arises on shutdown and log out.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it does not quite work this way. Many of those programs that do actually have a signal handler, don't block the signal to show a confirmation dialog. Signal handling is often minimal or missing.\nYou can easily try it without having to shutdown. Just send SIGTERM to your running Firefox or LibreOffice process:\n$ pkill firefox\n\nNormally, Firefox might ask if you really want to close it. Also, it usually takes a while to close, especially when it's been running for a long time and using more than 1 GB of RAM - it often takes like a minute for the process to terminate after the its last window has been closed. None of this happens when you send SIGTERM, the process is just terminated instantly.\nHowever, some desktop environments close all open windows before shutting down. Unlike SIGTERM, closing a window programmatically is like clicking on the X button of that window, or Alt + F4. This is also what the script in the other answer does - it uses wmctrl to close all open windows gracefully.\nWhen a window is closed, the program is not in a rush and it can close everything within that window, for example open tabs, and it can also show a dialog window if there's unsaved work. Once all open windows of an application have been closed, the process usually terminates shortly after that.\nSo it depends on your desktop environment (assuming you use your desktop environment to shutdown and not sudo poweroff). For example, KDE should wait for open windows to be closed before shutting down, while MATE doesn't.\nBottom line: Close all open windows manually before shutting down. Or use a desktop environment that waits for all windows to be closed.\n\nA: For what it's worth, some time ago, I have found this procedure on Manjaro forum:\nclose_apps () {\nWIN_IDs=$(wmctrl -l | grep -vwE \"Desktop$|xfce4-panel$\" | cut -f1 -d' ')\nfor i in $WIN_IDs; do wmctrl -ic \"$i\"; done\n\n# Keep checking and waiting until all windows are closed\nwhile [ \"$WIN_IDs\" != \"\" ]; do\n        sleep 0.1;\n        WIN_IDs=$(wmctrl -l | grep -vwE \"Desktop$|xfce4-panel$\" | cut -f1 -d' ')\ndone\n\n}\nYou can call it in a script of your own to close all open apps prior to shutdown(or restart).\nThe only problem being, it was created for Xfce so, it needs changes that Unity DE imposes. A little help from somebody more knowledgeable would come in nicely here to help solve OP's problem.\n\nA: Actually, a part of script that closes all windows and doesn't depend on any particular DE is available on Ask. 2-nd and 3-rd answers are particularly useful. With just few lines more, and by creating a launcher in panel or on desktop you can achieve the gracefull shutdown that works in the DE you're using.\nHow to close all open windows gracefully\n", "Q: How can I add FTP commands to an alias?

I just got some new speakers for the office (3.5mm jack), but unfortunately they don't seem to be recognized by my computer.  I also have a Yeti microphone that's plugged in via USB.  \nWhen the microphone is plugged in, Sound settings shows only the microphone as a valid output device. I can select it and play sound through headphones connected to it, but can't make sound come through the speakers no matter what I try. This screenshot shows my sound settings when the mic is plugged in:\n\nWhen the microphone is unplugged, no devices are listed under Sound settings for Output, but the sound will play through the speakers just fine. \nThe issue is that I would like to use the microphone as a microphone, and run my audio output through the speakers now.  How do I get my computer to recognize the speakers as a valid device with the microphone plugged in?\n\nA: Installing and opening pavucontrol, I was able to configure the computer to use the speakers as an audio device. They still don't show up as a device in the normal sound settings, but Ubuntu is successfully using them to play music, and that has stayed the default over a few reboots. I think as long as I don't touch anything, it should work.\nStill don't know why it's not showing up under Sound Settings, but at least it's working.\n\nA: have you tried using pavucontrol ? it has a lot more options for configuring pulseaudio devices.\nsomething looks odd with your microphone presenting an spdif output,\nhave your verified it works ok with other devices ?\n", "Q: Systemd, start user level unit with sudo access I have a Debian package which installs my software and it needs to start two applications in post install script. First one is daemon and the second one is a background process both are managed with systemd. The problem is that I run sudo dpkg -i ... , and it fails to start user level unit with the following error: Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory. It is a normal practice to start scripts after installation, but the sudo rights permit me to start my script. Maybe I'm missing something. Someone knows how to overcome this problem?\nThe command which is use to start script: systemctl --user start test.service. When it is executed from installer it actually becomes sudo systemctl --user start test.service.(Same doesn't work from terminal).\n\nA: Ok, I have managed to fix the issue. It was not an issue to begin with, just my lack of knowledge about DBus sessions and how do they work. I hope that my answer will help someone.\nWhen you will open terminal and execute systemctl --user command unit\neverything will be fine, but when you will try to do under sudo or switch to another user using su command, you will fail with error that I had: \nFailed to connect to bus: No such file or directory.\n\nThe problem is that systemctl to connect to user sessions uses dbus session address which is set in DBUS_SESSION_ADDRESS env variable.\nWhen you do sudo or su you get a very limited environment, simply you are missing DBUS_SESSION_ADDRESS and other env variables.\nSo when you get similar errors, check your environment perhaps something important is missing.\n", "Q: When I redirect to a \"tty\" where does it actually go on that \"tty\", is it \"stdout\" or \"stderr\" When I execute a command like:\necho \"Hello\" > tty/pts/2\n\nIt will print the message on that terminal. Is it redirected to stdout or stderr of that tty?\n\nA: Presumably your command is not right; As it stands it will save the string \"Hello\" to a file named 2 i.e. tty/pts/2 (if the intermediate directories exist).\nPerhaps you meant:\necho \"Hello\" > /dev/pts/2\n\nwhich will send the string \"Hello\" to the 2nd pseudo terminal.\nNow, the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR of the process running inside the terminal are bound to the pseudo terminal itself, so it is not really possible to single out the file descriptor of the process running within the terminal.\nYou can check that in /proc, by reading the file descriptor the shell that is running within a terminal, you will see that the standard streams are actually symlinked to the pseudo terminal.\nFor my zsh runing on pseudo terminal /dev/pts/46:\n/proc/self/fd% tty\n/dev/pts/46\n\n/proc/self/fd% ls -l           \nlrwx------ 1 foobar foobar 64 Jun 13 15:07 0 -> /dev/pts/46\nlrwx------ 1 foobar foobar 64 Jun 13 15:07 1 -> /dev/pts/46\nlrwx------ 1 foobar foobar 64 Jun 13 15:07 2 -> /dev/pts/46\n\n\nA: Simple test would be redirect stdout and then stderr of the command to /dev/null and see what happens.\nadminx@L455D:~$ echo \"hello\" > /dev/pts/22\nhello\nadminx@L455D:~$ echo \"hello\" > /dev/pts/22  > /dev/null # no output , stdout gone\nadminx@L455D:~$ echo \"hello\" > /dev/pts/22  2> /dev/null # stderr gone, but stdout shows up\nhello\n\nThus , stdout is what you see. \n\nA: Neither. stdin, stdout and stderr have meaning only when bound to processes.\n", "Q: Change Gnome panel icons to oversized faded style? How do I change the icons that show in the panel for apps?  I've tried different themes, but perhaps I'm just missing a specific one?\nI installed Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 and my icons on the panel look like this terminal one:\n(All screenshots are not my own, just found them for examples)\n\nI also installed Debian Gnome Jessie and the icons look like this Files one:\n\nMy question is, how can I get the Ubuntu icons to look like the Debian ones?  I much prefer the oversized faded style of Debian, but I would rather use Ubuntu.\n\nA: Solved it by accident.  After being frustrated with high cpu usage and overheating, I downgraded my Ubuntu Gnome installation from 16.04 to 14.04.  It seems the style that I wanted and preferred is the old style, and the new ones are the small regular icons.  \nI expected the style I was looking for to be a newer one since it seems more modern and looks much better, but I was wrong.\nI am now using Ubuntu 14.04 with Gnome Shell 3.10, with pretty icons, a cool CPU and an OS that suspends properly out of the box\nActual screenshot:\n\n", "Q: Why do I get 'This computer name is already in use on this network' prompt? I was installing 16.04 Desktop on a HP laptop yesterday, and when it came time to enter my name, username etc, most suggestions I had for the computer name generated a warning that 'This computer name is already in use on this network.', and I could not proceed with the installation without choosing something else.\nThere's only one Ubuntu VM on my LAN, and no other machines using vaguely similar names. I had connected to my wireless network and allowed updates during installation, but surely it's not checking every computer name in the world!\nWhy did this happen, and how can I make sure I can use a computer name of my own choosing?\n\nA: Are you sure that the name conflict prevented you from going on with the installation?\nI had the same warning last week when upgrading my systems, since i used the same names they used before I also got the warning (I think it comes from a DNS lookup), but it did not stop me from continuing at all, all I had to do was ignore the warning and click to continue.\n", "Q: Apt-get not installing include files usually when I ran a command such as\nsudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev libnetcdf11 libnetcdf-bin\n\nI would get installed both the netcdf.h and the netcdf.inc files.

No other file netcdf.xxx file.\nThis is really weird...anyone has an idea why that's happening?\n\nA: Uhm, well, apparently libnetcdf is only for C, for FORTRAN I have to install libnetcdff. Embarassing. \n\nA: In the changelog of the Ubuntu package libnetcdf-dev, corresponding to the version 1:4.1.3-1~exp2, there is tracked the change:\n\nSplitted C/C++/Fortran bindings for a better and sane migration path\n          towards 4.1.3 and beyond.

I tried to solve that by enabling Mousekeys from the Accessibility settings, but there are a number of problems with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I believe mousekeys is supposed to toggle when the Num Lock key is pressed, but it does not do so. Whether or not Num Lock is on, the mousekeys remains working; I can't use the numpad to type in numbers.\n\n*At startup, even though the system settings says Mousekeys is still enabled, it actually isn't. The numpad doesn't start working in Mousekeys mode until I toggle the MouseKeys option off and on again.\n\n*The motion of the mouse using the keys is far too slow to be usable. It seems to travel at less than 10 pixels per second.\n\n\n(3) isn't a terrible problem as I can still use the physical mouse to move the cursor, and just use the numpad to register the left and right clicks. However, (2) is slightly annoying and (1) is extremely annoying. I've seen another forum post say that Ctrl+Shift+NumLock will also toggle MouseKeys, but that was old and does not seem to work on my system.\nShould problems (1) and (2) be listed as bug reports? If not, then is there a command line method to enable and disable MouseKeys? And is there an option on this command to modify the movement speed of the mouse?\nBtw, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \n\nA: Please give this article a look, it is potentially a duplicate or at least a similar issue:  \nTurn Mousekeys on/off from keyboard\n", "Q: Using OpenvSwitch with DPDK in Ubuntu 16.04 I am trying to setup openvswitch with DPDK in Ubuntu 16.04 using the openvswitch-switch-dpdk package.

Given what you reported the most likely issue is right where the last error message points you to \"See ovs-vswitchd log for details.\" or in the Syslog where most of the EAL messages go.\nAt the time you add the port you likely just see that it can't find it.\nWhat will be more interesting for you is the log around the time when you (re-)start openvswitch.\nThere you should see it discovering and initializing the ports dpdk0 and dpdk1 - or if not, what errors are associated.\nAs a reference I uploaded my log, split into three columns for command, ovs-log and syslog.

Also, I don't have a disk that has a large enough space to have the ISO image on it.\nHelp anyone?\nThanks,\ndjtravz\n\nA: Since you cannot boot from USB, you could try booting over the network.\nHowever, there's an easier method using CD's.  I see in your question that you cannot load the images onto CD because of size.  I assume it's because the computer has a CD drive and not a DVD drive.\nIn this case, please follow this link to download an burn a MinimalCD.  It's a tiny image that will start the installation, and pull all the data(packages) over the internet during installation.  This can easily fit on a CD since most of these images are under 60 MB, and a typical CD holds ~650-700 MB.\n\nA: It would require another computer, \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/\nInstallation Installation without a CD -> Server and network installations\n\nA: The most practical way to do this is to remove the hard disk, temporarily connect it to another computer that can boot from DVD or USB, and install Ubuntu to the temporary drive.  A few tweaks to /etc/fstab may be required to get correct recognition of the partitions on the side-loaded drive, but once done, reinstalling the drive with Ubuntu on it will let the computer boot to Ubuntu.\nIf your friend only knows Linux, though, he'd probably be more comfortable doing this than you would...\n\nA: The answer to this is no, the closest things I thought of were the below 2 options. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a virtual drive\n\n*Create a ram disk\n\n\nCreating a virtual drive\nMy first thought for this was to create a virtual drive and then boot from there. There is one major floor with this though and that's the fact that when you get to the partition screen, you will need to remove or at the very least resize the Windows partition and this will cause issues.\nCreating a ram disk\nMy second though was a ram disk, the problem with this though is you will need to restart the computer in order to access the ram disk. This will mean that all the data from the ram disk will be erased and you won't be able to boot into it. \nThere are CD installers though, if you don't want to go for a DVD installation. There is the netboot install, but you will need to connect via a network cable to do that. \nThere is also a CD ISO download, but you will need 9 CDs in order to achieve that. \n", "Q: rsync ssh sshpass server1 server2 I have created 2 servers, new to ssh sshpass\ns1 ip 192.168.1.245\ns2 ip 192.168.1.76\nwanted to copy files in s1>>/opt/files to s2>>/home/s2/backup\nobjective: put 1 sentence in cron to do auto rsync\ni have these method\n1)\nusing ssh rsa key method, genkey and copy over the key\nit works for direct access. doesnt meet my need for rsync files\nperhaps i did wrong or missing steps or issue wrong commands\n2)\ntried SSHPASS\ncan store pass but still doesnt work\n3)\nSSH + SSHPASS\ngetting all kinds of error\nThe above 3 methods are google using SSH without password and SSHPASS without password\nAny expert could provide me with one line command or suggestion?\n\nA: You can leave the password blank when generating the private keys, if you do so, it will not ask for a password when establishing the connection later.\nrsync should work if you can establish a connection for \"direct access\" without a password, as long as you are using the same user (crontab -e).

How can I get the English (UK) spell checker to work in LibreOffice Writer?\n\nA: I know you made the changes in Ubuntu, but did you set it in Libre office? Tools, options, language settings, languages.\nI know it should seem that you should not have to do this, and maybe it is a bug in Libre Office, but I have found a lot of the time that for some reason a lot of open source software has their own setting for things like this.  \n\nA: You need the hunspell-en-gb package.\n\nA: Start the application by typing <Alt>+<F2> and running the command\nenv LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 libreoffice --writer\n\nObviously there should be better ways, but this one works.\n", "Q: Power meter ACPI000D:00: Ignoring unsafe software power cap I get the following message on Ubuntu 14.04 during boot:\npower meter ACPI000D:00: Ignoring unsafe software power cap\nThe message comes up shortly after the red/orange Ubuntu background appears and the screen goes black into console for a moment. The system loads fine afterwards and the login screen appears as usual. Nevertheless it's annoying. \nDoes anybody have an idea how to fix this?\nEDIT: While there is no issue using Ubuntu via display manager, the message persists in the TTY consoles which I cannot use anymore. \nUPDATE: I upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 and while the warning still shows up shortly during boot and is afterwards in the first line of the TTY consoles, they work as intended, i.e. I can finally log myself in and use them.\n\nA: This error occurs because the ACPI _PMC (Power Meter Capabilities) object for that device ACPI000D (the power meter) has bit 0 set that indicates that the device supports power measuring capability, however, the kernel driver has detected that the hardware does not support this feature and hence reports that the power capability is probably dubious and so ignores it.  Basically, the firmware indicates that power metering is available, but the kernel driver does not believe it for your hardware.\nCurrently, the only hardware that seems to allow this is certain IBM hardware with \"IBM Active Energy Manager\".\nFor more details about this ACPI functionality, consult section 10.4.1 of the ACPI specification.\nOne can force this feature on using the kernel parameter force_cap_on=1, however this is not advised unless you know what you are doing. \nI think this message can most probably be safely ignored.  One could turn the kernel error messages off completely to disable this, however, this will bar you from seeing possibly helpful errors that the kernel reports in the future. This message is being reported as dev_err() level device error message, so one would have to disable dev_err level error messages to silence this error. \nFor example, setting kernel parameter loglevel=2 will report emergencies, alerts and critical errors and ignore errors of level 3 (error) and below. To do this edit /etc/default/grub (with root privilege) and change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to include loglevel=2, e.g.\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nedit and set:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash loglevel=2\"\n\nsave the changes and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThe long term fix would be to modify the driver and change the dev_err to a dev_warn\n", "Q: Triple boot with Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 10 and SuSE Leap, can't see partitions during installation I trying to install Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 on a system with Windows 10 and Suse Leap 42.1 already installed and running.  Ubuntu's installer running from a DVD has very limited partitioning flexibility.  I created two Ext4 partitions using SuSE but Ubuntu won't recognize them.  It will only allow Ubuntu to use the entire disk.\nWill a Ubuntu 16.04 Live CD allow me to use the new empty partitions and, if so, how do I create a 16.04 Live cd/dvd?  The only references I've seen for live cds relate to earlier versions of Ubuntu.\nI have Ubuntu Server 16.04 installed on a 2nd PC.

I have two hard drives in my machine, both with multiple partitions.  The Ubuntu partitioner recognizes the partitions on my #2 drive but shows no partitions on my #1 (Windows boot) drive.  This is in the \"Something Else\" in the install partition routine.  I don't want to create new partitions on the boot drive fearing that it will destroy my Windows 10 folders.

How can I add these back into my UEFI so it will boot?\nWhen I try to boot I get a message: \"Invalid signature detected. Check Secure Boot Policy in Setup\"\n\nA: First, Ubuntu's Shim binary includes a copy of the Canonical (Ubuntu) public key embedded within it, and this binary is signed by Microsoft, so it should be possible to boot without the Canonical key in your firmware. That said, you might run into the issue you describe if you're using another Shim binary -- say, if you're dual-booting with Fedora and are using Fedora's Shim to get the boot process started. (Also, see the very end of this answer....)\nIn such a case, you should be able to use the MokManager tool to add Canonical's key to the MOK list, which Shim will read. MokManager should be on your disk's EFI System Partition (ESP) alongside the Shim binary. Ideally, MokManager should be an option on whatever GRUB or other boot manager menu you see when you boot. If not, you could adjust the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file to add such an entry, which should look like this:\nmenuentry \"MokManager\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/fedora/MokManager.efi\n}\n\nYou'll need to adjust that entry for your particular system. In particular, the set root option should point to your ESP, which might or might not be (hd0,gpt1); and the path to MokManager might be something other than what I've specified. (I'm showing a Fedora path as an example. Note that you must point to the MokManager binary that comes with the Shim binary you're using.)\nThere are a couple of other options available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could disable Secure Boot entirely. This is the easiest approach, but Secure Boot exists to improve security, so I don't recommend this as a general rule, especially if you're dual-booting with Windows. Details of how to disable it vary greatly from one system to another. I present several examples on this page of mine.\n\n*You could take full control of Secure Boot and add the Canonical public key to your firmware, as described on this page of mine. This approach is for those with significant \"geek street creds,\" though; it's technically challenging, and even people who are comfortable with command-line tools are likely to struggle a bit. I mention this approach mainly because your question's title refers to the PK and db, which are keys stored in this way. Canonical's standard approach to Secure Boot does not involve modifying these keys, but these variables are adjusted when you take full control of Secure Boot. If you did this before, perhaps all you need is a pointer to relevant documentation, so this is it....\n\n", "Q: Where is everything I install stored?

Like most things in Linux or, for that matter, life, it usually goes perfectly and invisibly. Once in a while, it does not.\nWhen it goes perfectly, the blacklist file is longer:\nblacklist b43 \nblacklist b43legacy \nblacklist ssb \nblacklist bcm43xx \nblacklist brcm80211 \nblacklist brcmfmac \nblacklist brcmsmac \nblacklist bcma \nblacklist b44 \ninstall wl \nmodprobe -r b43 b44 b43legacy ssb; modprobe --ignore-install wl ; modprobe --ignore-install b44\n\nThat is supposed to allow the otherwise blacklisted ssb to load and bring along b44 allowing the ethernet to work. For some reason it did not install such.\nSince you had the incorrect driver all along, it was quick and easy to purge bcmwl-kernel-source which also removes the blacklist-bcm43.conf file altogether. This allowed ssb, b43 (for wireless) and b44 (for ethernet) to load normally.

If you intend to use either, you will need to ensure your available swap space is large enough to hold all information your running system will have in RAM.

It seems sometimes I've created a shortcut/launcher without it.  Other times I've added the extension during file creation and later removed the extension and it still worked.\nSo, I'm wondering two things...  Given that a .desktop file can be created and/or viewed from a text editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the real, defining characteristic of a .desktop file the [Desktop Entry] at the top of the text file?\n\n*Is it really necessary to right-click the desktop and create a new file with the .desktop extension?  Or is it enough to create a new, empty file in a text editor and put the [Desktop Entry] as the header and fill in the remaining fields (Type=, Icon= , etc.).  \n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: Most desktop programs today use the Shared MIME-info Database to determine file types.\nThe MIME type definition for .desktop files is in the file /usr/share/mime/application/x-desktop.xml. In Ubuntu 16.04 the relevant lines are at the end of the file:\n<glob pattern=\"*.desktop\"/>\n<glob pattern=\"*.kdelnk\"/>\n\nSo most desktop programs will recognize a .desktop file only if it has a .desktop or .kdelnk extension, and the file content actually doesn't matter for that (but of course it will not work as a starter if the content is wrong).\nThere may be some cases where just a [Desktop Entry] line is enough but in general it's not. \nIt doesn't matter how you create a .desktop file. You can just use a normal text editor if you want.\n\nA: For the answer to your first question, the answer is yes ... and no. Yes because this is part of the syntax the launcher manager program uses. No because it does not make it a .desktop file.\nThe second question the answer would be yes on file creation, but you can edit it to remove the .desktop. This is because when Ubuntu creates the file, in the binary data it says that it is a .desktop file. Then if you edit it, it will not update it and it will still work. Unless you can find the binary code needed, not on file creation.\n", "Q: Handling file open (mime type) with Python I created a file mymime.xml\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<mime-info xmlns=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\">\n    <mime-type type=\"text/myapp\">\n        <comment>my format</comment>\n        <glob pattern=\"*.myformat\"/>\n    </mime-type>\n</mime-info>\n\nand a file myapp.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MyApp\nGenericName=My Generic Name \nComment=a comment\nExec=myapp\nIcon=myicon\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Development;\nMimeType=text/myapp;\nName[en_US]=MyApp\n\nNow when I right click on a file that has myformat ending, it suggests opening with MyApp, which is the behavior I was looking! But on the python3 code (I am using PyQt5), how do I take the loading argument when there is a file loaded like this?

The \"Install Ubuntu inside of Windows\" on 14.04.3 is some old Wubi option.  As for 16.04, I neglected to mention earlier that before booting up the LiveCD, I resized the Windows partition and left the space unallocated. I did not use the Gparted program to reallocate the unused space before clicking the install ubuntu icon.  Well, after frustrating myself over and over agin trying to make the \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" option magically appear, I started Gparted and used it to create the Ubuntu partition and swap file - plan was to use the \"Do something else\" option afterwards.

So lesson learned - the Install alongside option will not appear if all the installer sees is a Windows partition and unallocated space.\n\nA: I had installed ubuntu 15.04 alongside Windows7 and did not see any such option either.

This means Android Studio program hasn't writing access for the folder android-studio`.\n\n*To enable writing access, you put on the terminal sudo chmod o+w android-studio.\n\nNow you can update Android Studio.\n\nA: The best way in my opinion is to use JetBrains Toolbox.\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/\nThis small app allows you to update your JetBrains tools, including the official Android Studio. It detects Android Studio even if you did a manual setup.\n", "Q: Wanting to Erase all data for windows and install Linux but unsure about hardware complications Hey guys and gals I am in a, as one might say sticky situation, I wish to install Ubuntu onto a laptop that has a corrupt version of Windows 8 that will not let me bypass the recovery screen (Recovery and repair does not work, but BIOS does work [thanks]). Upon my decision to install Ubuntu I am having issues with the \"work side with Windows\" option (obviously), as I can not access my laptops data to back up, I am scared on loosing previously installed data for the hardware of my Windows 8 PC, and require information regarding weather or not the heard wear data will be preserved or destroyed. I would very much appreciate any help put forth and thank you for your time!\n\nA: I think your concern is with keeping Windows hardware drivers for Ubuntu install? Don't worry- the drivers are OS-specific, and you don't need that \"Drivers\" folder.  \nYou should be able to pop in the Ubuntu Live CD, and either install it directly over your entire hard drive, or (as I would prefer) use the gparted program to erase your entire disk, and then install Ubuntu there in the entire empty space.  \nAs far as hardware issues, there shouldn't be any unless your computer is extremely old or maybe a few days old. I still think there won't be any.  \nI have installed Ubuntu on old Emachines, cheap HP-2000, three different IBM (woot) Thinkpads, and my current Lenovo (ew) Yoga. Never an issue; Ubuntu is super good at hardware, usually. Most problems could be a video driver issue but, generally easy to remedy.  \nIf you need to actually explore the files and save some, I would still run the Live CD, open your Windows partition and try to get files that way. Backup to cloud storage or a USB stick, then install away.  \nPersonally, I find a forced loss of tons of data liberating (albeit time consuming and damaging in some instances) from time to time!  \nGood luck, we're here to help.\n\nA: For your personal data:\nYou can boot ubuntu live CD (DVD), choose \"try ubuntu\" and copy your data to another storage like USB drive or another computer or cloud. The best thing is to start with a clean (void of any data) disk when installing ubuntu.\nFor your device itself:\nYou should boot the ubuntu live CD (DVD), choose \"try ubuntu\" and check if your hardware works. Many devices from your laptop will just work, like: cpu, disks, video, usb, keyboard, trackpad. Some other devices might not work, like: finger-print readers, penabled touch screen (touch screens that will also work with stylus, they will work, but probably only the pen). Test your hardware and if you are pleased with your device you should install ubuntu on the clean hdd.\nYou can get away without using a separate storage, but this is for seasoned users and is dangerous and unforgiving.\n", "Q: How to disable the authentication prompt from DVD mount and eject (16.04) I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04.

I shut the phone down by clicking on the Notification Panel at the top, selecting System > Shutdown and then Power Off. Here I am pressing Shutdown and not Restart. Is there a setting that I can adjust or turn on/off to ensure that the phone does not reboot when I turn it off?\n\nA: I know about this bug. This often happens with me, when I had a long session with my phone and especially when there were many progress with the Unity 8 gui e.g. switching between staged and windowed mode. In these cases the display server seems to work optically properly, but for real it runs laggy. You sometimes reconize it by failing updates and installations. When you press shutdown, not your phablet reboots (there's not the initial bootscreen) but just the display server (lightdm). But the error persist. My only known possibility getting out of this loop is a hard power off by pressing the on button about ten seconds or so. I also hope this bug will be removed in the future.\nHope I can 'help' you.\n", "Q: How to make Document Viewer allow me to scroll through the pages? I am currently in the process of building an LFS system, and the LFS book comes in the format of a >300 page long PDF file. I am reading it via Ubuntu's default document viewer, and when I started I was able to scroll through the pages using my touchpad fine. Now, however, I can only scroll through the contents of one page, and must press N to get to the next page. I have restarted Document Viewer but to no avail.\nHow can I change this annoying functionality, so that I am able to scroll through as I normally would?\n\nA: What you want is called \"continuous\" scrolling. The location of the setting might differ from version to version. In Ubuntu GNOME 16.04:\n\nIn older versions and in Unity, I think it might be in the \"View\" menu.\nAssuming the keyboard shortcut hasn't changed, try pressing C.\n", "Q: Using EasyDNS on a dedicated server - stuck I recently built a dedicated server with Ubuntu 16.04 and the only thing left to do is set the DNS/Nameservers on it to start hosting other domains on it.\nI'm getting really confused about what to do here.\n------------ What I've Done So far\nI created an account with EasyDNS to use as my host DNS.  I added an A record in this account to point to my server.\nI added dns-nameservers 111.222.333.444 to the /etc/network/interfaces file.

I also tried just adding an A record pointing to my server.\nWhen I ping these domains I get unknown host example.com .  When I enter command host example.com I get example.com not found: 5(REFUSED)\nAny thoughts on what I missing or done wrong?  Thanks for the help!\n\nA: Please review these steps - Source\n\n\n\nThe default setup of Ubuntu does not make it easy to use static DNS servers while using DHCP.

When the system boots, the network is configured based on the /etc/network/interfaces settings.  I can ping or login to the box remotely via ssh. \nWhen the local user logs in via the graphical interface, they have the eth0 network running for about 10-30 seconds (wired icon is initially visible), and then the system removes/disables the device and no networking is available and only an empty wifi icon is shown.  I have a usb wifi device that has been configured in the past but it is not connected to the computer.\nIf I open a term and run sudo ifconfig eth0 up, networking is enabled (static address) and the NetworkManager icon changes to the wired icon and notes that the ifupdown interface is connected.\nSome relevant log messages:\n<trimmed for space>\n\nand my NetworkManager.conf file:\n# This file is installed into /etc/NetworkManager, and is loaded by \n# NetworkManager by default.

I have, before posting here, removed my wifi configuration and I still have the same issue with the wired connection \"going away\".\nSomething got screwed up.  Any thoughts?  I can't seem to connect this specific user-only problem with other similar issues on the web.  The network is just down for most people with similar problems, all or nothing.  For my system, it seems to be user specific.\nAdditional content\nFollowing on from my comment/reply below, here is my updated interfaces file.  I also only added the hotplug option during my own problem solving phases because I thought it was a nice feature in case I had to swap out cables for whatever reason.

The first sentence says:\n\nUnder Linux, at always warns you that it will execute the specified\n  commands with /bin/sh, rather than your favorite shell. You cannot\n  suppress this message, it's hard-coded in the source code.\n\nIt also suggests a workaround:\n\nThe command you pass is interpreted by /bin/sh. This command can be the path to a script if you like; then /bin/sh will execute the script program, causing the script's interpreter to be launched and to interpret the script. The language of the script is completely independent of the program that starts it. So if for example you want to execute a bash script (i.e. a script that begins with #!/bin/bash), just pass the path to the script to at and ignore the irrelevant message.\n\nSo, to run your commands with bash instead of sh, you could pass a script to at. As long as the script has a shebang line, it will be executed by whatever program the shebang is pointing to. If you use #!/bin/bash, it will be executed by bash.\n", "Q: Ubuntu software for writing ISO image to SD card?

I log in with my usual user (admin) in graphic environment.  Once logged, I'd like to run GUI-commands like if I were another user (normal), to test a client-server application. I need several users (one for server and another for each client), because each one needs an own $HOME environment. In the future, they are supposed to be installed in separate machines. \nSo, I open a terminal and I do: \nsu - user \n\nWhen I run any GUI command (such as 'xterm'), it tells the usual \n\n\nNo protocol specified\n    Cannot open display:\n\n\nI read several ways to solve this using xauth, xhost, etc., but the one that worked for my purposes was: \nadmin# sudo cp ~/.Xauthority ~user/. \nadmin# sudo chown user ~user/.Xauthority\nadmin# su - user\n\nuser$ export XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority\n\nNow I can run any GUI command, such as xterm. \nHowever this solution, only works within same GUI session. Once you reboot computer, .Xauthority file changed, and this solution is no longer valid, unless I copy .Xauthority again, which is tedious and involves sudo commands to copy. \nSo, is there a way, to make it persistent within .bashrc or some other way? I mean, once I open a terminal from GUI and log in using su - <user>,  would be capable to run commands that require GUI without have to do all previous stuff. \nSorry for English. \n\nA: You can use a local network login (ssh) instead of su. The option -X will enable forwarding of the X connection:\nssh -X username@localhost\n\nFor this to work, you must have a secure shell server (sshd) running on the host (apt install openssh-server). It will prompt you for a password and drop you in a shell, just like su - username, but with forwarding of the X Window connection. It works for remote hosts, but also locally.\n", "Q: No Sound from Front Headphone Ports My Front Headphone port has stopped working on its own recently as in no sound is coming from them.

I then had issues with grub (it would boot straight into Windows), which I fixed using boot-repair on my Ubuntu installation usb. After fixing that and checking to make sure both Windows and Ubuntu work, I continued working from my Ubuntu side for 6 hours. Everything worked. I shut off my computer properly for the night and when I booted it up again this morning it went straight to BIOS with no boot options. Can someone please help me? \n\nA: Update: Apparently Asus has an issue with a screw that comes loose. This screw, which connected the hard drive bracket to the computer, happened to come off and rest on the exposed pins of the hdd essentially jumpering them. I just put the screw back in its rightful place and everything came back!\n", "Q: How do I run R programs from Sublime text 2 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? I have R programming environment in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I also have Sublime Text 2 and I want to run R programs in it. I don't have any IDE like RStudio and even I dont want to use them as I am just a novice in R programming. So please suggest me a method to run R programs directly from Sublime Text 2. \n\nA: I'm not familiar with R, but according to this answer, you run a script from command-line using Rscript. With Rscript installed, you can then create a custom build system for Sublime Text (Tools > Build System > New Build System). At its most basic, it would look something like this:\n{\n  \"cmd\": [\"Rscript\", \"$file\"],\n  \"selector\": \"source.r, source.R\",\n  \"working_dir\": \"${project_path:${folder}}\",\n}\n\nNow, you can build your R script by pressing F7 or from Tools > Build.\n", "Q: When will Software Updater notify of 16.04 Xenial Xerus availability? I am currently using Ubuntu 14.04.04 LTS Trusty Tahr. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenia Xerus has been released but Software Updater so far has not notified me as it has other people, e.g.: \n\n\nNote that I am talking about just LongTerm Support releases, not intermediate releases like 15.10, such as some questions address.\nThe Updater settings should be allowing this notification to occur: \n\n\nWhen will the 16.04 notification occur?\n(If the setting for new versions is changed to \"For any upgrade\", the Software Updater dialogue offers Ubuntu 15.10. Why?)\n\nA: There are a number of questions similar to mine; obviously I didn't choose the correct keywords to find those questions initially. The answer is that Software Updater does not notify you of a new LTS upgrade until the first point release, e.g. 16.04.01 in the case of Xenial Xerus 16.04 LTS. \nTo save you the trouble of finding those questions (which mostly tell you how to edit a config file or use command switches in the Terminal), start the Software Updater GUI and make any necessary changes there.\nCheck Software Updater > Settings button > Updates tab – click the link in the question above. The 'Notify me of a new Ubuntu version' setting must be set to For long-term support versions. The other two settings will either show no notifications for any release, or for all releases, including development or LTS releases.\n", "Q: How do I run a Supervisor task from cron.hourly?

But the declaration, v=value, is taking place on the called non-interactive shell.\nSo, in total, you have the variable defined in the called shell and expanded (beforehand) in the calling shell.

I have heard the commands like sudo, apt-get and many other commands from my colleagues. As a beginner, what are all the commands I should be aware of? Can anyone please help.\n\nA: Your question is very general. \nThere are thousands of commands available to do various jobs. Most users start to learn specifically about the commands when they have some purpose. \nThis page from Ubuntu Documentation has details about the Ubuntu terminal and in the bottom there are links to many sites which gives details about the commands. You can refer to them. \n\n\n*\n\n*A very general list of basic commands is here. \n\n*A very authoritative book { The Linux Command Line: William Shotts } is here . Pdf available. This site itself is full of useful resources. Explore !\nImportant :  Usually each command has a manual (man) page which gives the syntax and other details. You can refer to these man pages when in doubt about a command. Just Google the command with 'manpage' and you will surely get relevant result. \n\nA: There are several nice commands cheat sheets, for example\nhttps://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/\nOne serious warning.

What options do I have when stuck with DHCP whilst trying to achieve a publically accessible web server.\nI'm looking to save as much money as I can as I'm currently out of work and hoping that I can use the server to showcase an online portfolio, which is why I've taken this route.\n\nA: It's pretty straight forward.  You'll need a static IP set on your ubuntu server, this IP will sit within your LAN.\nFor example...\nVirgin Media Superhub - 192.168.0.1\nUbuntu Web Server - 192.168.0.5\n\nYou will need to enable port forwarding on your superhub to point to your Ubuntu server IP.  If you're looking just to host http, you'll only need to forward port 80, tcp.  If you want to also use SSL, forward 443 tcp.\nThe next thing you'll need is to select a Dynamic DNS provider.  This service sits and listens for requests from your Ubuntu server, your server will report it's public IP address to the service, and then the service will assign a dynamic DNS entry to point at your public IP.  When your IP changes, the service will be aware of that change and then reassign to your new IP.\nI won't go into detail about the selection, becuase Ubuntu has a community wiki page that will continue being maintained with the latest and greatest.\nThat information can be found here.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS\n\nA: Not having a static IP address is a problem for a web server, theoretically it would be possible to make a script that checks your current WAN IP address, and then (if possible) update that IP to a Domain Name that you have bought automatically, if the DNS provider allows some sort of automatic update mechanism.\nEven if you can do this, you might still run in to problems, with the new IP address for your DNS name/URL cascading through the DNS root servers, and not everybody having/getting the new IP address right away, or people who are attempting to cache the IP of the Domain name etc.\nBut it would be the only way to find your server, if it's IP keeps changing.\nYou would still need to pay for a Domain name/URL though.\nEdit: somebody else posted the same idea while I was posting mine, sorry for the double answer.\n\nA: The easiest way in my opinion is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First configure your ubuntu server to have a static local ip as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html\n\n*Then open the ports you need to your router, for example apache default port is 80 (the configuration at my router can be done from Advanced Setup-> NAT-> Virtual Servers).\n\n*Finally use a free service to have a free domain name like http://www.noip.com/. You need an account first, then you choose a free domain name (the free ones have weird endings like .ddns.net) and after you install the noip duc and you make it run at boot (I can give you further instructions if you have problem with the site' guide). This will update every time your new web ip (the router's ip not the local one) and direct it to the domain name you chose.\nFor exapmle my server's local ip is 192.168.2.222 (which I use when I want to access it from a local pc inside the same network) and the domain name is lichking.ddns.net which directs to the ip I have at the moment (I use this to access my server from anywhere outside my network).\n", "Q: SD card is recognized but can't open it: “can't read superblock” (Almost the same question but the solution proposed therein do not solve my problem)\nSo I can mount the micro SD card but when I click on it I get:\nError mounting /dev/mmcblk0p1 at /media/me/NIKON D3100: Command-line `mount -t \"vfat\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,utf8=1,showexec,flush\" \"/dev/mmcblk0p1\" \"/media/me/NIKON D3100\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: /dev/mmcblk0p1: can't read superblock\n\ndoing:\nsudo parted -l /dev/mmcblk0\n\nyields:\nModel: SD SL16G (sd/mmc)\nDisk /dev/mmcblk0: 15,5GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags\n 1      4194kB  15,5GB  15,5GB  primary  fat32        lba\n\n(so it is fat32 but neither vfat nor exfat.

Please note that I am using -p 2222 because that's the port number I use instead of 22, your server may use a different port number so check for that information if something seems not to be working as expected.\nI am going to name it ssh1 and give it the proper execution permissions with: \nsudo chmod +x ssh1\n\nThen move the script to your /usr/bin folder with sudo mv ssh1 /usr/bin, provide your user password and that's it.\nAfter this you can enter any terminal, write your script's name (ssh1 in this case) and hit ENTER and the script will do the trick for you.\nA screenshot of my custom script in action is here:\n\nNOTE: You must manually log in to your ssh server at least once in your life in order to the script be able to automatically do its magic.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I retrieve only the needed line from terminal output? I want to get only let's say third line of df -h output.\nWhat kind of command should I use?\n\nA: I assume you're not necessarily looking for the third line, but for the line that either mentions a specific disk (e.g. /dev/sda3) or a specific mount point (e.g. /home).\nSo instead of just displaying the third line, which is insecure because the output order might change and you might get a different result, you can filter the output by content and show only the lines that match a specific pattern or contain a keyword.\nYour tool for this is grep.\nFor example if you want the line about device /dev/sda3, you type:\ndf -h | grep '/dev/sda3'\n\nIf you want the line mentioning your home directory as mount point, use:\ndf -h | grep '/home'\n\n\nA: You could also use perl:\ndf -h | perl -ne 'print if $.==3' \n\nThe $. is the current line number, so you could print the Nth line with perl -ne 'print if $.==N'.\n\nA: This will output the 3rd line, regardless of content.\ndf -h | sed -n 3p\n\n\nA: My first idea would be a head-tail-construct.\nExample:\ndf -h | head -3 | tail -1\n\nhead -3 causes the output to stop after three lines and tail -1 will output only the last line.\nAlternatively, if you know, how the output will look like, you could also use grep to find lines containing a certain string.\n\nA: The df command actually accepts an argument identifying the filesystem you want. So you could use, for example, df /home or df /dev/sda3.\nIf you intend to parse the output for a script, you'll want to use df -P to guarantee it never wraps to multiple lines. So, for example, you could use df -Ph /home | tail -n +2 (but if you're parsing output for a script, be aware of the possibility of filenames with spaces in them)\n\nA: You can use a combination of head and tail:\ndf -h | head -3 | tail -1\n\nOr\ndf -h | tail -n +3 | head -1\n\nBut note that, df allows to filter the output from the options of df itself, you should look at those first before using any external command.\nCheck man df.\n\nA: Awk is text processing tool, so it's appropriate for this task\ndf -h | awk 'NR == 3'\n\n", "Q: How can I setup an encrypted home directory or encrypted disk using TPM? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell computer that has TPM.\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to protect the files in the home directory in case the disk\nis removed from the computer and plugged into another computer,\nencryption will be a reasonable solution for this\n\n*I need for the current computer to not ask for a passphrase on\nboot (as it will be sort of a public computer).\nTo meet these two needs, I have discovered that TPM is exactly what I need and fortunately the computer has TPM. The encryption key can be stored in the secure TPM chip and it can be used to automatically decrypt the disk on boot.\nHowever, there is no clear instruction on how to achieve this.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: According to \nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man4/tpm.4freebsd.html#contenttoc3\nthe Supported tpm modules are: \n       ·   Atmel 97SC3203\n       ·   Broadcom BCM0102\n       ·   Infineon IFX SLD 9630 TT 1.1 and IFX SLB 9635 TT 1.2\n       ·   Intel INTC0102\n       ·   Sinosun SNS SSX35\n       ·   STM ST19WP18\n       ·   Winbond WEC WPCT200\n\nIf your chip is supported then a good starting point for tpm 1.2 would be \nhttp://www.ranzbak.nl/tpmluks/\nIn any other case (Support for TPM 2.0 is still incomplete as far as i know) you could alternatively just use encrypted luks and store the password on a removable usb key that you could carry with you.\n", "Q: ssh-tunneled SOCKS proxy connection refusals on Firefox 47.0 / Kubuntu 16.04 I am having difficulty making connections to websites using Firefox over a tunneled SOCKS proxy.  SOCKS4/SOCKS5 makes no difference.\nI set up the tunnel with\n\nssh -D 1234 id@remotehost.example.com\n\nthen point Firefox's SOCKS proxy to localhost on tcp/1234.\nOne key point to note here is that the tunnel I am setting up is on a remote server I have been using for this purpose for many years.  I have proxied FF and other browsers through it for many thousands of sessions on a dozen or more different platforms across all major OSes.  Once I get it working, it always works smoothly.  However, on this particular instance of FF, I get odd and intermittent problems.\nThe problem is that FF doesn't seem to \"want\" to establish a connection.  I type in a URL or click a link and I instantly get \"Unable to connect\" / \"Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ...\"  When I say \"instantly,\" I mean this pops back to me in some small fraction of a second.\nSo I hit \"Try again\" or the little reload arrow.  And I do it again, and again, and again, as rapidly as I can.  And after a few tries -- sometimes 3-4, sometimes as many as 15-20 -- I get a connection and everything works!  So the tunnel / SOCKS connection is available, it's just that FF refuses to use it until it is bullied into doing so.  Once I get a connection, further reloads do not cause it to be lost.\nI have some add-ons, but a) I've disabled them selectively with no help, and b) I have (of course) tried safe-mode.  There is no change.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I have to use a proxy everyday at work in order to connect to servers on the other side of a firewall.  I also use Firefox, Chrome and Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nEDIT:  I forgot one part of this.  I have had to add a timeout to a ssh config file or my tunnel will timeout and I lose my connection.  Once I added the following stuff, my connection stays open:\nIn ~/.ssh/config add the following information (if the file does not exist, create it.).  This will send a server keepalive to your tunnel every 15 seconds.\nHost *\nServerAliveInterval 15\n\n\nI open my tunnel connection with the following command:\nssh -CfND 1234 username@proxyhost\n\nThen in Firefox under the Connection Settings in the Manual proxy configuration I only fill in the SOCKS Host: with 127.0.0.1 and Port: 1234.  Then I make sure that SOCKS v5 is selected.  Also note that I don't have anything in the No Proxy for: box. \nI am able to connect to my hosts that way without any problems. \n\nThen for Chrome I run a command line so I don't have to set the settings to Chrome every time I want to go through the proxy, then no proxy.  To connect Chrome to the proxy I run the following line:\nnohup google-chrome-stable --proxy-server=\"socks5://127.0.0.1:1234\" & > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nfrom ssh manpage\n\n -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,\n         stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connec‐\n         tions).  The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1),\n         and the “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option\n         for protocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines\n         and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on\n         fast networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host\n         basis in the configuration files; see the Compression option.\n\n -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.\n         This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or\n         passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This\n         implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a\n         remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.\n\n -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐\n         warding ports.\n\n -D [bind_address:]port\n         Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.\n         This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local\n         side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a\n         connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over\n         the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to\n         determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently\n         the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act\n         as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.\n         Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configura‐\n         tion file.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Unfortunately, this problem is intermittent and that has confounded my troubleshooting efforts.  The answer @Terrance gave above, which I marked as The Answer, is actually not a solution to the problem for me. It seemed to work, and actually worked for a while.  Then I ran into problems again.  Sometimes stopping my ssh session and restarting it would cure the problem -- for a while -- and sometimes the restart would make no difference.\nThe suggestion mentioned this thread elsewhere -- i.e.,  to specify 127.0.0.1 rather than \"localhost\" in the browser's proxy settings -- likewise seemed to make a difference but was ultimately ineffectual. I previously answered that this was the critical difference between the browser connections working and not working, but again this was premature. I continued to experience intermittent problems in my browser's ability to make connections with websites through the tunnel.\nI have now obtained enough additional experience with this problem and the solution I mention below that I am reasonably confident in my conclusion that there is a short-timeout bug of some kind in OpenSSH itself.  BTW, my version is\n\nOpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.2g-fips  1 Mar 2016\n\nI base this on a) the fact that the problem is clearly browser-independent (verified in Firefox, Chromium and w3m) and b) the fact that using an alternate ssh client has reliably cured the problem.\nI downloaded the source and built and installed PuTTY (from this link).  NOTE:  make sure you install virtual package gtkgl-dev so the PuTTY source can find the header files. Then I set it up just as I have in Windows so many times in the past, and it's been working a treat for about two days now.  ZERO failures.\nI am confident that this is the fix and that there is a bug in the current OpenSSH.  I will work on making a report to that effect.\nI am selecting my own answer as The Answer for purposes of this question, though @Terrence's answer above is still very useful reading.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04, Folder 'Places' pointing to extended partition Before anything please excuse my wording if I refer to something in the wrong way (newbie).\nI installed ubuntu 14.04 first and then alongside I installed Biolinux 8, when asked for the partition I gave ubuntu 14.04 the Principal one (1.9 Tb) and Biolinux the extended one (100 Gb).

So far I have found none. \nI would imagine that this is a fairly common thing. How can I make user_2 see an application installed under user_1 and further run it?\n\nA: The issue is likely that your .desktop file for intellij only installed in the original users ~/.local/share/applications/intellij.desktop is what creates an icon you can search for and launch. If intellij wasn't actually Installed to that user locally try the following.\ncp /home/user2/.local/share/applications/intellij.desktop /home/user1/.local/share/applications/intellij.desktop\nsudo systemctl restart lightdm.service\n\nYou could also add the .desktop file for All users\n cp /home/user2/.local/share/applications/intellij.desktop /usr/share/applications/intellij.desktop\n\nPlease note that the .desktop file may not be called intellij.desktop, but you should be able to find it.\nEdit: It's possible that intellij was installed locally to user_2. If that is the case then copying the .desktop file won't work. The .desktop file essentially tells Ubuntu what to do when a user wants to launch that application. If a user doesn't have permissions to the files it won't work.\n\nA: this is because you most likely didn't install the program using apt-get.\nyour main solutions, are either to install intellij in user_2, or you could find the executable. if you installed using .tar.gz, then it might be in your home directory. so, on user_2 you open a terminal, and type cd /home/user_1/.name_of_intellij_directory of course, replacing user_1 with the name of user_1, and replacing .name_of_intellij_directory with the name of the intellij directory. if you don't know then name, you will have to open nautilus go to root>home>user_1 and press ctrl+h yo show hidden folders. you should see the name of the intellj directory there. then you go back to the terminal and type ls -la (assuming you already used the cd command) and post the output in your original post.\n", "Q: ubuntu 16.04 fstab fails with nobootwait I just clean install Ubuntu 16.04 (to replace 14.04) with the intention of porting bulk of the working fstab file, in order to mount other JFS disk/partitions.

Maybe nobootwait NEVER worked (I never had boottime failure of the disk) in 14.04 and 14.04 just ignored the error, but I want the supposed functionality of nobootwait.\nHas there been a change in Ubuntu 16.04 or the linux kernel regarding nobootwait?\n\nA: Looks like there are 2 relevant options that need to be set to imitate nobootwait behavior, taken from systemd mount manpage:\n   nofail\n       With nofail, this mount will be only wanted, not required, by\n       local-fs.target or remote-fs.target. This means that the boot will\n       continue even if this mount point is not mounted successfully.\n   x-systemd.device-timeout=\n       Configure how long systemd should wait for a device to show up\n       before giving up on an entry from /etc/fstab. Specify a time in\n       seconds or explicitly append a unit such as \"s\", \"min\", \"h\", \"ms\".\n\nso setting options to nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 should make the system wait 1 second for device to be mounted before continuing the boot.\n\nA: This option appears to have been dropped.  The Ubuntu manpage for fstab contains this text if you select 14.04 LTS at the top:\nThe  mountall(8)  program  that  mounts  filesystem  during  boot  also\n recognises additional options that the ordinary mount(8) tool does not.\nThese  are:  ``bootwait''  which  can  be applied to remote filesystems\nmounted outside of /usr or /var, without which  mountall(8)  would  not\nhold up the boot for these; ``nobootwait'' which can be applied to non-\nremote filesystems to explicitly instruct mountall(8) not  to  hold  up\nthe boot for them; ``optional'' which causes the entry to be ignored if\nthe filesystem type is not known  at  boot  time;  and  ``showthrough''\nwhich  permits  a mountpoint to be mounted before its parent mountpoint\n(this latter should be used carefully, as it can cause boot hangs).\n\nThis paragraph does not exist in the version of the page you get if you select 16.04 at the top.\n\nA: If you're just looking for how to replicate nobootwait behavior in 16.04 it seems that the option you're looking for is nofail. From http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man5/systemd.mount.5.html\n   nofail\n       With nofail, this mount will be only wanted, not required, by\n       local-fs.target or remote-fs.target. This means that the boot will\n       continue even if this mount point is not mounted successfully.\n\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 16.04, the default init system is systemd which replaced mountall.  http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man5/systemd.mount.5.html provides new options that likely eliminates the need for nobootwait.\n", "Q: Unable to ping box after logout I have a physical machine running ubuntu server 16.04, and I am having a bit of trouble interacting with it. When I run ifconfig I see it's public IP address, but when I try to ping it from another machine nothing happens.\nWhat I have been able to do in order to interact with it, is on the server, login as some user, run sudo service networking restart and then I can interact with the machine remotely (ping for example). However, the second I run exit or logout on the server, I can no longer interact with it again.\nIt's also worth noting that I don't seem to be able to ping anything from the server until I restart the networking like I mentioned just above.

There's a way to install programs from USB?\n(I have only one computer connected)\n\nA: Like Brian Sizemore said, most software comes in an installer, such as a .deb. fortunately, apt-get comes with an option to download software without installing it! first, open a terminal ctrl+alt+t, and use the command apt-get download \"name of software\" (replace \"name of software with the name of the software\") and it will download the software to your computer in your home directory. from there, you can move them to a flash drive. then when you want to install them, just open the files no the flash drive.\nNOTE: most programs have dependencies. meaning, you have to install other programs first. so, if it says you have unmet dependencies, just repeat the process with the name of the dependencies\n\nA: If there is an installer file then all you have to do is copy that file onto the machine from USB and run it. If there are just a bunch of files that have to be manually installed then I suggest you write a shell script that will handle it and then you can open the USB and run it on each machine.\n", "Q: Does the LibreOffice 5.2 snap use my existing profile?

No need to give functionality if the file does not exist.\n\nA: In the bash shell on the command line.\nif [[ -f /path/to/file ]]; then echo \"Yes\"; fi\n\nThis uses the bash conditional operator -f, and is checking whether the file exists and is a regular file. If you want to test for any files including directories and links then use -e.\nThis is a great resource for bash conditionals.\n\nA: The shortest command for doing what you want is:\ntest -e FILENAME && echo Yes\n\ntest -e will test whether the name given exists in the file system. (You can use test -f to restrict to regular files only. See man test for more.)\nIf the condition given evaluates to true, then test returns a successful exit status (otherwise it returns a failure status). We combine the two commands using &&, which means \"execute the next command if the previous command exited with a success status\". The next command simply prints Yes on standard output; in the case of an interactive shell, on the terminal.\nThis avoids the additional textual material of an if statement, yet gives the same result. Using && (or its opposite, ||) to tie commands together works well when only a single command is involved. If you want to do more than execute a single command in response to a single command's exit status, then using the if syntax quickly becomes much more readable.\nAs already pointed out in other answers, the equivalent if style construct would be:\nif test -e FILENAME; then echo Yes; fi\n\nor alternatively:\nif test -e FILENAME\nthen\n    echo Yes\nfi\n\nFor these purposes, [ and test are equivalent, except that [ demands a terminating ].\n\nA: To skin this type of question there's multiple ways, and here's another one : use find command with -exec flag . The path to file can be split into two parts find /etc which sets directory and -name FILENAME which specifies filename (duh!) . -maxdepth will keep find working with /etc directory only and won't descend into subdirectories\nadminx@L455D:~$ find /etc -maxdepth 1  -name passwd -exec printf \"YES\\n\" \\;\nYES\nadminx@L455D:~$ find /etc -maxdepth 1  -name passwd1 -exec printf \"YES\\n\" \\;\nadminx@L455D:~$ \n\nAnother way , via stat :\nadminx@L455D:~$ stat /etc/passwd1 &>/dev/null && echo YES\nadminx@L455D:~$ stat /etc/passwd &>/dev/null && echo YES\nYES\n\nAnd alternatively  via python :\n>>> import os\n>>> if os.stat('/etc/passwd'): \n...    print 'YES'\n... \nYES\n>>> if os.stat('/etc/passwd1'): \n...    print 'YES'\n... \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/passwd1'\n\nOr a short command line alternative : \n python -c \"from os.path import exists; print 'Yes' if exists('/etc/fstab') else '' \"\n\n\nA: Use this simple Bash one-liner:\nif [ -e FILENAME ] ; then echo Yes ; fi\n\nThe -e check evaluates to true if FILENAME exists, no matter what it is (file, directory, link, device, ...).\nIf you only want to check regular files, use -f instead, as @Arronical said.\n\nA: You can use this simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -f $1 ]]; then\n    echo \"Yes\"\n    exit 0\nelse\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nSave it as file-exists.sh. Then, in the Terminal, type chmod +x file-exists.sh.\nUse it like: ./file-exists.sh FILE where you replace FILE with the file you want to check, for example:\n./file-exists.sh file.txt\n\nIf file.txt exists, Yes will be printed to the Terminal, and the program will exit with status 0 (success). If the file does not exist, nothing will be printed and the program will exit with status 1 (failure). \nIf you're curious why I included the exit command, read on...\n\nWhat's up with the exit command?\nexit causes normal process termination. What this means is, basically: it stops the script. It accepts an optional (numerical) parameter that will be the exit status of the script that called it.\nThis exit status enables your other scripts to use your file-exists script and is their way of knowing the file exists or not.\nA simple example that puts this to use is this script (save it as file-exists-cli.sh):\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Enter a filename and I will tell you if it exists or not: \"\nread FILE\n# Run `file-exists.sh` but discard any output because we don't need it in this example\n./file-exists.sh $FILE &>> /dev/null\n# #? is a special variable that holds the exit status of the previous command\nif [[ $? == 0 ]]; then\n    echo \"$FILE exists\"\nelse\n    echo \"$FILE does not exist\"\nfi\n\nDo the usual chmod +x file-exists-cli.sh and then run it: ./file-exists-cli.sh. You'll see something like this:\nFile exists (exit 0):\n➜  ~ ./file-exists-cli.sh \nEnter a filename and I will tell you if it exists or not: \nbooleans.py\nbooleans.py exists\n\nFile does not exist (exit 1):\n➜  ~ ./file-exists-cli.sh\nEnter a filename and I will tell you if it exists or not: \nasdf\nasdf does not exist\n\n", "Q: Installing imod_4.7.15_RHEL6-64_CUDA6.0.csh in ubuntu Can anyone help me with the installing of imod_4.7.15_RHEL6-64_CUDA6.0.csh software.imod is a image software,which I have downloaded from http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html.I have extracted the file using zip-unzip command.but I am unable to run it as a software.\n\nA: Run in the terminal:\ncsh -f imod_4.7.15_RHEL6-64_CUDA6.0.csh\n\n", "Q: How to use windows phone as a webcam in Ubuntu 14.04?

Formatting is standard off-the-shelf, I believe, although I did run a top shareware bitchecker on them before I put them in use.  The SanDisk programs are still there, and I'm not using any of their encryption.\nWhen I copy files from Lubuntu to the thumb drive, although Lubuntu differentiates file-name letter case, and the letter case is retained on the thumb drives, the thumb drive barfs when two separate files in the same directory have the same name but different case.  Lubuntu asks \"Do you want to skip, overwrite, or rename?\".  Not only that, under unusual circumstances--if a default overwrite is in effect-- it will silently RENAME the file to the previous file's case pattern, while overwriting the old file.\nObviously this renders backing up between Lubuntu systems a pain.\nI want to be able to use the thumb drive to copy between Lubuntu's without having to worry about case and duplicate file names.  And I want to be able to copy back & forth from a Lubuntu to a Mac or PC too.  The files are large (around a Gig each), so I have to be able to maintain speed.\nIs there an easy way to change settings on a SanDisk Extreme Pro so it does this?\nIs there a way to format the SanDisk so it can handle both requirements?  What steps would I use to do this on Linux?\nAlternatively, is there a way to format the SanDisk so it has two partitions, one that works back & forth for Lubuntu's, and one that can nicely talk with PCs?  What steps?  I'm willing to lose the unique filenames on the partition that can talk with PCs, if I can keep it on the partition used to sneakernet between Lubuntu's.\nThanks.\n\nA: Your thumb drive probably has a case insensitive file system. You would need to format it using a case sensitive filesystem do be able to do what you want.\nYes, you can format it to have two partitions, use gparted to create a partition table and 2 (or more) partitions on your thumb drive, set the first one as vfat (that´s the one you will be able to use on windows), and the other as ext4 (that´s going to be case-sensitive).\n\nA: Off the shelf format on SanDisk is Fat32 (vfat) which is case insensitive. There are a couple of nice GUIs to repartition your drive, I prefer 'gnome-disks' if available for lubuntu, or gparted as mentioned above. \n", "Q: How do I install VMware Workstation Player 12.11 on Ubuntu 16.04?

I'm trying to migrate my system to a SSD, and there's this 512mb EFI partition that's giving me trouble. Is this thing a leftover from Windows 8? Does Ubuntu need it to function properly? I'm not using dual boot.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu needs that EFI partition. UEFI is a (relatively) new method of booting for operating systems, and is much more featured than legacy/BIOS boot. Look it up for some more details.\nIf you don't copy it over, you aren't going to be able to boot, as it stores the bootloader files for OSes that support EFI. There may be Windows stuff left over, but there's also almost definitely GRUB files in there as well.\n\nA: If you're copying an existing Ubuntu system, yes, then you must also copy the EFI partition. \nIf you can do a fresh installation, you might also decide to do a legacy install which does not need an EFI partition. There's no way to convert an installed system from UEFI to Legacy or vice versa. At least I don't know any, it's definitely not trivial.\nTo explain what this EFI partition is about:\nIt's needed for newer systems that use the (U)EFI technology to boot. This partition is common for all installed operating systems.

My installed versions are:\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS (amd64), \nEclipse 3.8.1, \nPyDev for Eclipse   5.0.0.201605051159\n\nA: Pydev 4.5.5 works!\nFinally I tried to install older versions of pydev via the links provided on \nhttp://www.pydev.org/update_sites/index.html\nHere I used version 4.5.5, the highest version that doesn't require java 8.\nThis works together with the eclipse 3.8.1.\nAlthough I have installed openjdk 1.8 pydev doesn't seem to find a java 8 API.\nThe possible reason is that the highest java version the osgi framework provides ist 1.7 !\nThe relvant configuration entry is (might be):\norg.osgi.framework.executionenvironment=OSGi/Minimum-1.0,OSGi/Minimum-1.1,OSGi/Minimum-1.2,JRE-1.1,J2SE-1.2,J2SE-1.3,J2SE-1.4,J2SE-1.5,JavaSE-1.6,JavaSE-1.7\n\nMaybe this is the solution until Canonical provides an Eclipse with an updated osgi framework.\nTo avoid the installation of  inconpatible pydev 5.0 or higher during eclipse's software update function one should not use the standard pydev update site (http://pydev.org/updates).\n\nA: Unfortunately, PyDev 5 does not work in Eclipse 3.8 anymore. See other user's report in pydev-perspective-not-showing-after-install-on-eclipse-3-8 - StackOverflow.\nIn the installation page of PyDev, the latest PyDev version to be used is listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Eclipse 4.5, Java 8: PyDev 5.2.0\n\n*Eclipse 3.8, Java 7: PyDev 4.5.5\n\n*Eclipse 3.x, Java 6: PyDev 2.8.2\n\n*Python 2.5 or older: PyDev 5.5.0\n\n\nMy PyDev can work in Eclipse 3.8 by manually installing PyDev 4.5.5. It can be downloaded in PyDev for Eclipse - SourceForge.net.\nAfter downloading the zip file, extract the contents of the zip file in the following folder and restart Eclipse.\n     ~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.8_155965261\n\nIf you do not have the folder, see the section Installing with the zip file in the installation page for hints.\nI do not have Java 7 installed. My PyDev 4.5.5 can appear in Window->Preferences->PyDev in Eclipse 3.8 with Java 8.\n\nA: If I use the latest sources, eclipse will say \"sources are not found\". So I have to use https://dl.bintray.com/fabioz/pydev/4.5.5/ as the software source. It will work. My system is Ubuntu 16.04, 64 bits.\n", "Q: Removed UEFI partition, how do I fix a new one? I just upgraded my XPS 13 laptop from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04. I wanted to use full disc encryption, so I chose to let the installer delete everything and install in an encrypted LVM. My laptop show me a message saying it can't find a boot option, something I now understand is because i deleted my /efi partition. I was unaware that there was such a thing as a UEFI partition, and i would like to restore it/create a new one but have NO idea how to do it in the easiest way. It works to use the legacy boot option, so the installation is working just fine as it is, it is just annoying to be forced to use the boot menu when starting the computer\nI really don't feel like restore the 14.04 with the Dell tools and reinstall everything since i have not been able to get things such as swap work for encrypted computers without using the option to go full disc encryption in the installer. Would it maybe be possible to install the Dell restore disc along side 16.04, and then just delete it, let the /efi partition alone and reclaim the disc space into the 16.04 LVM.\nAs might be evident from my post, I am still very much a (happy) linux newbi\n\nA: If you've got sufficient free (unallocated/unpartitioned) space on the disk, you can use GParted, parted, gdisk, or other tools to create a new partition in that space. The partition must:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be big enough -- I recommend 550 MiB or a bit more, but significantly smaller than that can work.\n\n*Use a FAT filesystem, preferably FAT32 (a really small partition would need FAT16, though).\n\n*Have the type code for an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is identified as having a \"boot flag\" in GParted, parted, and other tools based on libparted; or as having a type code of EF00 in gdisk.\n\n\nNote that if you don't have sufficient unpartitioned space on your disk, you'll need to shrink an existing partition. Depending on how your partitions are set up, this could be a tricky task. This question and its answer covers this task. If you need more help, I suggest you post a new question, but be sure to include partitioning and LVM details, since there are so many variables related to these details that a meaningful answer without them will be impossible.\nAlso, creating the partition is not sufficient; it must also contain a boot loader, and the firmware must be configured to boot that boot loader. There are many ways to set this up, but the two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Boot Repair on the computer. This must be done from an EFI-mode boot, so you'll need to boot from an installation or emergency disk in EFI mode, which can be tricky to do if you don't understand the details of how your computer manages its boot modes.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager on the computer. The best way to do this is to boot your normal installation using rEFInd on a USB drive or CD-R (download links for both are available on the rEFInd downloads page) and then install rEFInd via the Debian package or PPA.\n\n\nYou should need to do one of the above two things (or any of many other things that will have similar end results); however, if one doesn't work for you, you can either try to debug it or try the other approach.\n", "Q: RTL8188EE wireless card not functioning properly I am running Ubuntu 14.04 on my ASUS laptop.  I previously had Windows 10 on the system.  With Windows 10, the Wi-Fi capabilities worked flawlessly, but when I installed Ubuntu I began having Wi-Fi issues.  I can connect to most Wi-Fi networks successfully.  However, it seems that if there is any traffic on the network at all, my connection is so slow that most websites won't load.  The only wireless network that I can use consistently is my home network, on which I am the only user.  Also, I have to be within 20 or 30 feet of my home router for the connection to work on Ubuntu.  On the other hand, when I had Windows 10 I could browse the internet consistently in my bedroom, which is about 60 feet away from the router.  \nSince I had no Wi-Fi trouble with Windows 10, do you think this issue could be caused by the driver installed on Ubuntu?  I have not tampered with the driver, so the one that Ubuntu installed automatically is still on the system.  I ran the wireless-info program to aid in troubleshooting, and I posted the results here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/17336238/.  Apparently I have a Realtek RTL8188EE wireless adapter, and the driver running is specific for that adapter.\n\nA: Windows offers automatic switching between Access Points and channels to find the best connection. Ubuntu comes with GNOME Network Manager that does not offer this fuctionality.\nThis will cause problems if you use your laptop in a congested enviroment.\nTo solve this you need to get your computer to do the hard work through a script such as getwifi .\n", "Q: Can't open script as application I'm trying to install puush on my computer, everything works great until I run chmod +x.\nAfter that, the script will still only open in gedit.\nI read through similar questions on this site as well as others and have yet to get the script to execute.

There is a lot of software that has this type of issue under Wine.\nI can only suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Wine in Windows XP Emulation Mode\nRun winecfg, and choose \"Windows XP\" for the Windows Version, and hit \"OK\".\n\n*If that doesn't work, select the earliest Windows Version in that drop down that the software is reported to work on in winecfg and try again.\n\n*If neither of these steps work, then you are very likely not going to get the software to work properly under Wine.  This is, unfortunately, quite commonplace with many many proprietary applications.\nThere is, unfortunately, no guarantee that all apps work under wine, and it's possible this is the case with this piece of software - it may just not work under Wine / Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to open magnet torrent links from Firefox in rTorrent? I am using the command-line torrent client rTorrent under Xenial Xerus and I would like to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find and click on a magnet torrent link with Firefox\n\n*Have the magnet link opened automatically in rTorrent and start downloading\n\n\nI believe a script is needed to be called from within Firefox, but the writing of such a script has so far defeated me...\n\nA: The problems usually lie with mime type and default handlers.\nFirstly, have you changed Firefox's about:config settings? ie:\nnetwork.protocol-handler.expose.magnet -> false\n\nand reset other options \nas per this Firefox deluge Q&A.\nHave you set up rTorrent to watch any particular directory?\nFILE: ~/.rtorrent.rc\n# Maximum and minimum number of peers to connect to per torrent.\nmin_peers = 50\nmax_peers = 80\n\n# Maximum number of simultanious uploads per torrent.\nmax_uploads = 5\n\n# Global upload and download rate in KiB. \"0\" for unlimited.\ndownload_rate = 0\nupload_rate = 50\n\n# Default directory to save the downloaded torrents.\ndirectory = $HOME/torrents/downloads\n\n# Watch a directory for new torrents\n# SET your watch directory here --v \nschedule = watch_directory,5,5,$HOME/torrents/watch/*.torrent\n\nport_range = 60125-64125\nport_random = yes\ndht = auto\n\n# UDP port to use for DHT.\ndht_port = 63425\n\n# Enable peer exchange (for torrents not marked private)\npeer_exchange = yes\n\n# Check hash for finished torrents.\ncheck_hash = yes\n\nencryption = allow_incoming,try_outgoing ,enable_retry\n\nThen it is a simple matter of \"save as\" into $HOME/torrents/watch.\nChange $HOME/torrents/watch to whatever torrents subfolder you use, or at least $HOME to /home/username\nCreate a file and add the following script:\nFILE: maglink-rtorrent.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd $HOME/torrents/watch    # set your watch directory here\n[[ \"$1\" =~ xt=urn:btih:([^&/]+) ]] || exit;\necho \"d10:magnet-uri${#1}:${1}e\" > \"meta-${BASH_REMATCH[1]}.torrent\"\n\nDon't forget to make it executable \nchmod +x maglink-rtorrent.sh\n\nThis also offers the ability to download from terminal by:\ncd $HOME/torrents/watch\n./maglink-rtorrent.sh \"MAGNET-LINK-HERE\"\n\nFurther awesome Service Tips and rTorrent setup options here.\nFuther credits:\n\n\n*\n\n*magnet links and command line 1\n\n*magnet links and command line 2\nUpdate 2:\nIf not using rTorrent, but kTorrent or qBittorent, then this following is the way to get that running:\n# check defaults\nxdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/magnet\ngvfs-mime --query x-scheme-handler/magnet\n\n# set defaults\nxdg-mime default qBittorent.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\ngvfs-mime --set x-scheme-handler/magnet qBittorrent.desktop\n\nThere's a further setting (from memory) for whether you require commandline.\nFor rTorrent though, this link is the FlexGet rTorrent Magnet URI Handler\nFull information here.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The following script is a spin on Max Gonzih's code that works both with regular .torrent files and magnet links:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntorrent_file_or_magnet_link=\"$1\"\n\n# Edit rtorrent.rc to automatically start downloads when a .torrent file\n# appears in this directory.\ncd \"$HOME/.rtorrent/watch/start/\"\n\n# XT stands for \"exact topic\".\n# BTIH is the BitTorrent info hash:\n# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme#BitTorrent_info_hash_(BTIH)\n# This is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash of the torrent file info section\nmagnet_regex=\"xt=urn:btih:([^&/]+)\"\nif [[ \"$torrent_file_or_magnet_link\" =~ $magnet_regex ]]; then\n  torrent_hash=${BASH_REMATCH[1]};\n  magnet_link_length=${#torrent_file_or_magnet_link}\n  # To conform with the bencode encoding, the magnet link's number of characters\n  # must be part of the torrent file, otherwise rTorrent can't read it.\n  # Same for the \"e\" at the end.\n  # See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode\n  torrent_file_content=\"d10:magnet-uri${magnet_link_length}:${torrent_file_or_magnet_link}e\"\n\n  # Note that rTorrent will read this torrent file, start downloading\n  # the file and then remove the torrent file\n  echo \"$torrent_file_content\" > \"$torrent_hash.torrent\"\nelse\n  cp \"$torrent_file_or_magnet_link\" .\nfi\n\nYou can use this in a script (let's call it pass_to_rtorrent.sh) and have Firefox pass the torrent file or magnet link to the script:\n\nMake sure the script is executable: chmod +x pass_to_rtorrent.sh\n", "Q: Compose \"dead_greek\" with compose key The config file for my compose key /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose lists all the key sequences for composing Greek letters; all of them require the pressure of a special dead_greek key. This is not a physical key of course, so, how can I assign an arbitrary key sequence to my compose key which produces this virtual dead_greek?\nAlso, I'd be interested to know if you have found a comfortable keyboard configuration regarding the compose key in general, and Greek letters in particular.\n\nA: Not a perfect solution, perhaps, but I used\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 191 = dead_greek dead_greek dead_greek dead_greek\"\nThis mapped the F13 key on my keyboard to dead_greek (the four repeats are for different combinations of SHIFT and ALTGR with F13). The number 191 comes from looking at the output of xev | sed -ne '/^KeyPress/,/^$/p' when pressing F13 (it shows keycode 191).\n\nA: @libervurto\nI basically love your thoughtful key bindings; theyʼre very intuitive.\nHowever (thereʼs always a “however”), allow me to point out that even though “letters” in different alphabets like Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic may look the same, they may by no means be the same. Take «P». In Latin itʼs the glyph (graphic representation) that denotes an unvoiced bilabial plosive (namely, our western “P”); in Greek and Cyrillic, however it stands for the sound of Latin “R”. And this is only one example out of dozens and dozens. So, you canʼt simply discard the different shapes that just happen to look like a Latin letter. In other words, theyʼre anything but synonymous.\nThereʼs a distinction between “glyph” and “codepoint” in Unicode; “codepoint” being the meaning of a symbol, codified by a Unicode number, and “glyph” being its visual representation (the letter you see on the screen). In concrete terms:\n\n*\n\n*«A» = Unicode $0041, as part of the extant Latin alphabet (in Unicode written as U+0041)\n\n*«Α» = Unicode $0391, as part of the (modern) Greek alphabet\n\n*«А» = Unicode $0410, as part of the Cyrillic alphabet (what we commonly and erroneously call Russian); and it gets even weirder:\n\n*«ꓮ» = Unicode $A4EE, as part of the little‐known Li‐Su abugida (syllabic alphabet), the script of a remote South‐Asian Sino‐Tibetan people\n\nAll four look exactly the same but represent different entities in terms of their respective languages. E·g·, “Greek A” is called “Alpha”, since it represents a different glyph than “Latin A” or “Cyrillic A”. (That's why they have different code points.) (Con artists exploit this coincidence to no end to create authentic‐looking phishing sites.)\nIncidentally/accidentally, in this case they represent similar sounds, but, as demonstrated above, that is usually not the case. (Remember the Soviet Union? Their abbreviation looked like CCCP to Latin readers, but actually stood for SSSR [Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik]: Союз Советских Социалистических Республик [СССР].)\nThings get (a lot) more complicated once we look at uppercase and lowercase letters and their correlations. Thus the best strategy is to keep everything in place, in conformance with the now widely implemented Unicode standard. (One day, maybe less than a year out, it will be the ONLY standard.)\nTherefore, I took the liberty to modify your chart to be a little more inclusive.\n(I posted this not to correct you or call you out but to give concrete examples to people looking for exactly this kind of information.)\ninclude \"%L\"\n\n# Greek alphabet\n#\n# Greek key bindings use corresponding Latin characters as much as possible and plausible.\n# Latin characters not present in Greek are used for Greek characters not present in Latin:\n# \"C\" invokes Sigma Luna [U+03A2] (so far not assigned in Unicode)\n# \"H\" invokes Eta; \"J\" invokes Khi (Chi)\n# \"Q\" invokes Theta; \"U\" invokes Upsilon; \"V\" invokes Psi; \"W\" invokes Omega\n#\n# Greek Core Alphabet Uppercase\n<Multi_key> <g> <A> :       \"Α\"    U0391    #

Different capitalization for convenience\n\n*Type the Latin alphabet equivalent.\n\n*Release compose key.\n\n\nYou can see the list of compose sequences configured system-wide in file /usr/share/X11/locale/$LANG/Compose, where $LANG is environment variable for current locale (for US English, it is equal to en_US.UTF-8):\n$ cd /usr/share/X11/locale/$LANG/\n$ less Compose\n\nTo enable compose for Greek alphabet add to your ~/.XCompose file:\n~/.XCompose\n# GREEK CAPITAL LETTERS\n<Multi_key> <G> <A> : \"Α\"    U0391    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA\n<Multi_key> <G> <B> : \"Β\"    U0392    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA\n<Multi_key> <G> <G> : \"Γ\"    U0393    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER GAMMA\n<Multi_key> <G> <D> : \"Δ\"    U0394    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA\n<Multi_key> <G> <E> : \"Ε\"    U0395    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER EPSILON\n<Multi_key> <G> <Z> : \"Ζ\"    U0396    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ZETA\n<Multi_key> <G> <H> : \"Η\"    U0397    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA\n<Multi_key> <G> <I> : \"Ι\"    U0399    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA\n<Multi_key> <G> <K> : \"Κ\"    U039A    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER KAPPA\n<Multi_key> <G> <L> : \"Λ\"    U039B    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA\n<Multi_key> <G> <M> : \"Μ\"    U039C    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU\n<Multi_key> <G> <N> : \"Ν\"    U039D    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER NU\n<Multi_key> <G> <P> : \"Π\"    U03A0    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PI\n<Multi_key> <G> <R> : \"Ρ\"    U03A1    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER RHO\n<Multi_key> <G> <S> : \"Σ\"    U03A3    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA\n<Multi_key> <G> <T> : \"Τ\"    U03A4    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU\n<Multi_key> <G> <U> : \"Υ\"    U03A5    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON\n<Multi_key> <G> <F> : \"Φ\"    U03A6    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI\n<Multi_key> <G> <X> : \"Χ\"    U03A7    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI\n<Multi_key> <G> <O> : \"Ω\"    U03A9    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA\n\n# DOUBLES (additional stroke <Q>)\n<Multi_key> <G> <Q> <T> : \"Θ\"    U0398    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA\n<Multi_key> <G> <Q> <O> : \"Ο\"    U039F    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMICRON\n<Multi_key> <G> <Q> <X> : \"Ξ\"    U039E    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER XI\n<Multi_key> <G> <Q> <P> : \"Ψ\"    U03A8    # GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PSI\n\n# greek small letters\n<Multi_key> <g> <a> : \"α\"    U03B1    # GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA\n<Multi_key> <g> <b> : \"β\"    U03B2    # GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA\n<Multi_key> <g> <g> : \"γ\"    U03B3    # GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA\n<Multi_key> <g> <d> : \"δ\"    U03B4    # GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA\n<Multi_key> <g> <e> : \"ε\"    U03B5    # GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON\n<Multi_key> <g> <z> : \"ζ\"    U03B6    # GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA\n<Multi_key> <g> <h> : \"η\"    U03B7    # GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA\n<Multi_key> <g> <i> : \"ι\"    U03B9    # GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA\n<Multi_key> <g> <k> : \"κ\"    U03BA    # GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA\n<Multi_key> <g> <l> : \"λ\"    U03BB    # GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA\n<Multi_key> <g> <m> : \"μ\"    U03BC    # GREEK SMALL LETTER MU\n<Multi_key> <g> <n> : \"ν\"    U03BD    # GREEK SMALL LETTER NU\n<Multi_key> <g> <p> : \"π\"    U03C0    # GREEK SMALL LETTER PI\n<Multi_key> <g> <r> : \"ρ\"    U03C1    # GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO\n<Multi_key> <g> <s> : \"σ\"    U03C3    # GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA\n<Multi_key> <g> <t> : \"τ\"    U03C4    # GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU\n<Multi_key> <g> <u> : \"υ\"    U03C5    # GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON\n<Multi_key> <g> <f> : \"φ\"    U03C6    # GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI\n<Multi_key> <g> <x> : \"χ\"    U03C7    # GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI\n<Multi_key> <g> <o> : \"ω\"    U03C9    # GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA\n\n# doubles (additional stroke <q>)\n<Multi_key> <g> <q> <t> : \"θ\"    U03B8    # GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA\n<Multi_key> <g> <q> <o> : \"ο\"    U03BF    # GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON\n<Multi_key> <g> <q> <p> : \"ψ\"    U03C8    # GREEK SMALL LETTER PSI\n<Multi_key> <g> <q> <s> : \"ς\"    U03C2    # GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA\n<Multi_key> <g> <q> <x> : \"ξ\"    U03BE    # GREEK SMALL LETTER XI\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*A question (and its answers) on \"SE.Unix & Linux\" for some notes on XCompose usage: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/307711/53143\n\n*man Compose for more details.\n\n\nMost used letters can also be set up with separate compose key combinations. For example, π:\n<Multi_key> <p> <i> : \"π\"    U03C0    # GREEK SMALL LETTER PI\n\nYou can also save this list in a file called GreekCompose and use include command in ~/.XCompose:\ninclude \"%L\"\ninclude \"/path/to/GreekCompose\"\n\nThe list above was created by manually adjusting output of small Python script: https://github.com/rybak/scripts/blob/master/extra/gen_x_compose.py\n\nA: Do xmodmap -pke | grep dead_greek\nIf there's no output, you don't have a key representing dead_greek.\nYou can assign one. For example, I just assigned the right Alt key to dead_greek:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 108 = dead_greek Meta_R Alt_R Meta_R'\nand now I can type rAlt a rAlt b rAlt g and it comes out as αβγ.\n\nA: I have experimented and come up with (IMHO) far more user-friendly bindings.\n\n\n*\n\n*All Greek letters are prefixed with <g> whether capital or small.\n\n*After the prefix, start typing the name of the letter in English: e.g. 'chi' for 'χ'.  (This will usually be a single character but sometimes two.)\n\n\n*\n\n*There are two exceptions to this rule: eta 'η' is 'h', and omega 'ω' is 'w'.  This is to avoid requiring three characters to be typed to distinguish between omega and omicron; in the case of eta it is clearly the ancestor of 'h' and besides, its starting 'e' would conflict with epsilon which is far more commonly used in mathematics and science.\n\n\n*Capital Greek letters are inserted as described above but typing in capitals or at least the first letter capitalized.\n\n*Some Greek letters have variants that can be accessed as described above but with the variant prefix <g> <v>, for example <g> <v> <e> produces an epsilon variant ϵ.\n\n*I have removed Greek capital letters that are synonymous to Latin capital letters as these seemed redundant.  Are there any cases where they would be displayed differently?\n\n\n# Greek alphabet\n<Multi_key> <g> <a> :       \"α\"    U03B1    # GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA\n<Multi_key> <g> <b> :       \"β\"    U03B2    #

filter out those that won't work\nsed -Ee 's/^<dead_greek>\\s+/<Multi_key> <d> <g> /g'\n\nIf you don't mind overwriting various compose sequences like Compose g t (for greater than), then just remove the <d> above and use <g> as your prefix.\n", "Q: kubuntu 16.04: Sound card \"access denied\" error, can't play sound I've checked out a dozen or more \"solutions\" (such as the one here), but my problem seems to go deeper than any of them.\nIt all started when I built wine.  I installed a few dozen dev and other packages.  I can reconstruct the list if necessary.  I rebooted and came back to the desktop and sound was gone.  I clicked the audio control icon and saw only \"Dummy output\" where previously my actual audio controller had been.\nSo I tried various suggestions I found online and the upshot was, even the audio icon disappeared.  Now my system can't even access my sound card:\n$ lspci -v\n[excerpt]\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) HD Audio > Controller\n  Subsystem: Lenovo 82801JI (ICH10 Family) HD Audio Controller         \n  Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11\n  Memory at f4700000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]\n  Capabilities: <access denied>\n  Kernel modules: snd_hda_intel\n  sudo modprobe snd_hda_kernel\n  modprobe: FATAL: Module snd_hda_kernel not found in directory /lib/modules/4.4.0-24-generic\n\nI've uninstalled and reinstalled pulseaudio and alsa, twice.  I even reinstalled the Linux image itself:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nNone of this has made any difference.  Is there anything else I should try before reinstalling and forgetting I ever heard of wine?\n\nA: Two-part solution.  The first part I found by trial-and-error:\nRemoving the oss4 packages:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge oss4-base oss4-dev\n\nrestored my sound immediately.  I didn't even have to log out, much less reboot.  However, I still had no sound icon.\nA search on that problem led me here, which told me to install package kmix.  I tried it.\nIt didn't restore the sound control panel I had -- it gave me something much superior to what I had!  I really like being able to control event sounds independent of the general device volume.\nSo I am back in business without having to reinstall. What a relief.\nI am marking this as the Answer, but if someone comes forward with a more straightforward explanation or troubleshooting advice when the sound card is truly not seen even at the module level, I'll relocate the answer check mark.\n", "Q: Get raml2html to work on 14.04 I'd like to be able to execute raml2html to generate documentation for some APIs that are specified using RAML.

It does this by explicitly terminating all of the child processes left around by the service.  Hence the signal.\nThis is a readiness protocol mismatch.  MongoDB does not speak the forking readiness protocol, and it is not correct to change the systemd service unit to say that it does.

So I usually avoid suspending my computer.\nBut sometimes I accidentally click on Suspend when trying to Shutdown. Which suddenly suspends my computer without giving any warning!.

That way, we can have suspend options which does ask for user confirmation.\nThe .desktop file bellow allows mimicking the 3 options from the session indicator in the top panel: Shutdown , Suspend , and Logout. Double clicking on the icon by default will bring up confirmation for shutdown. Right clicking on the entry will bring up the list of other options.\nPreferably , you'd want it to be stored in ~/local/share/applications folder and have executable permissions.

The snap packaging format finally frees us from dependency hell by allowing each package to have its own copy of dependencies. I'm interested in the technical details in how it does this. How does it handle:\n\n\n*\n\n*snaps depending on the version of a library already installed via deb packages for the current release? Does it ignore the installed library?\n\n*different snaps specifying the same version of the same library? Does it do deduplication somehow?\n\n*updates to core libraries that are likely to be used by a lot of snaps? OpenSSL comes to mind as a huge pain point.\n\n\nxdg-app has something called a \"runtime\":\n\nA fundamental concept in xdg-app is the runtime/application split.\n  Every app depends on a runtime, which supplies the core libraries that\n  the app relies on. Runtimes are typically shared by many applications,\n  but a user can have multiple runtimes installed at the same time.\n\nIt seems that in the case of OpenSSL, it would be part of the runtime in xdg-apps, so an update to OpenSSL should transparently affect all xdg-apps using the same runtime.\n\nA: I don't think that snaps check what dependencies are already installed. It just includes all of its dependencies and runtime (which is partly why the LibreOffice snap is 287 MB and the flatpak is about 200MB).\nSnaps include pretty much everything the software needs to run. I don't think anything gets shared between snaps.\nWhen a snap updates however, it will only download the dependencies that are new, and not the entire snap.\n\nA: Additional clarification is in order about the way snap packaging handles shared dependencies. \n\nSnaps include pretty much everything the software needs to run. I don't think anything gets shared between snaps.\n\nThis statement in one of the answers is partially true, however all installed snap packages except for the core snap depend on two packages, one of which is the core snap.\n\n\n*\n\n*snapd - which is installed by default in 16.04 and later\n\n*core   - (the core snap) which is automatically downloaded and installed when the first installed snap package is installed\nAll snap packages except for core itself depend on the core snap. If there is anything wrong with the core snap, then some or all of the other snaps won't work. A problem with the core snap can be fixed in the following two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the core snap. Even if this doesn't work, the results of running the following command will provide additional information that will help solve the problem.\nsudo snap refresh core  \n\n\n*Uninstall the core snap and all snap packages and then reinstall them.\nsudo snap remove core snap-package1 snap-package2  \nsudo snap install core snap-package1 snap-package2\n\n\nA: The first two situations are handled in a clever way.\n\nOne of the interesting features talked about is deduplication support\n  for content within Snap packages. Snaps would be automatically\n  deduplicated of common files shared between snaps based upon their\n  file hashes. There would be de-duplication on the file-system layer,\n  de-duplication on snap downloads (with server support), and perhaps\n  de-duplication of mapped libraries from the linker. Deduplication is a\n  big work item and likely will take a while to implement fully, but\n  it's an interesting goal nevertheless.\n\nSource: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-Snappy-Deduplication\nAs for the third situation, they have something similar to the runtimes that you mentioned:\n\nThere are three layers that make up a snappy machine: the system\n  layer, provided by Canonical, a layer of frameworks that extend the\n  base system produced by vendors in collaboration with Canonical, and a\n  set of snappy applications, provided directly by vendors. Updating any\n  piece just means using the new version of a read-only image. Reverting\n  to a previous version is just as easy.\n\nSource: http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/snappy\nThere is no good documentation describing frameworks yet, primarily because they seem to still be working out the boundaries of what a framework is. Here is an excerpt from their mailing list that might help clarify things.\n\nI am experimenting with Frameworks to essentially extend the Snappy\n  base system by software and services which lots of snaps require but\n  should not be included in any and each snap due to update issues and\n  size. The best example i have for this, is the openssl binary. Many\n  snaps need this to generate and validate keys and certificates.\nThe other issue i tied to solve with a framework is the access to\n  system wide resources, mote notably ports. Eg, a web server framework\n  would provide ways for other snapps to inject their web service api\n  and end points via reverse proxy into the framework running the web\n  server.\nI was told on IRC that i am kind of abusing the framework concept, but\n  still these two issues come up on my desk often.\n\nSource: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/snappy-app-devel/2015-November/000442.html\n", "Q: Large snap packages because of dependencies Snap packages each have their own copy of dependencies. This means there are lots of packages in each snap, which would equate to large package sizes. Wouldn't this mean that snaps would be so much bigger than traditional debs? How can I make them smaller? I have limited space.\n\nA: Seems like there's a conflict here for you. Snaps do some great things, but they will, by their very nature, require more space than packages which share dependancies. As much as I hate people who give this response, you'll need to consider if snaps are right for you instead of old fashioned packaging. If you're completely out of options and you really need a way forward, you could do something extreme like btree subvolumes made from snapshots, but that's way over the top.\n", "Q: Change the order of Boot Drive I have dual OS in my laptop, and I cannot change the order of their booting.

Haven't touched it\n\nA: Try test0000 as password . It should ask you to create a passphrase afterwards \n\nA: I recommend removing Chrome completely from the Chromebook rather than running a Chroot. It makes everything run faster and much smoother.\nI'm seeing a lot of people, in questions like these, answer saying that you can't remove ChromeOS from a Chromebook due to Chrome custom BIOS not letting you. I want to clear that up and say you can.\nThis tutorial-like answer is for installing the full version of Ubuntu to your Chromebook. It isn't a version of Ubuntu like Chrubuntu but the real, full-fledged, OS.\nHow?\nI installed SeaBIOS on my Chromebook and installed Ubuntu 17.04 from a flash drive, however, I think that SeaBIOS also allows you to install an OS from Jeltka (I'm not sure what that is and I didn't use it; I already had the flash drive made).\nSeaBIOS boots from SSD by default but, as it's loading, you can tap esc and boot from any device listed. This lets you run a native OS as well as any other OS that is compatible with your hardware from a USB.\nTo replace Chrome's custom ROM and install different OSs, you have to first put your Chromebook into \nDeveloper Mode:\nTo invoke Recovery mode, at login screen, you hold down the ESC and Refresh (F3) keys and tap the Power button.\nTo enter Dev-mode you first invoke Recovery, and at the Recovery screen press Ctrl-D (there's no prompt - you have to know to do it). It will ask you to confirm, then reboot into dev-mode.\nDev-mode works the same as always: It will show the scary boot screen and you need to press Ctrl-D or wait 30 seconds to continue booting.\nHardware\nAfter this, you will need to bridge the write protect jumper with your chromebook off and preferably with the battery out!\nNOTE\nThis is where the write protect jumper is on a Parrot Chromebook (Acer C710); it will probably be located in a different place on your Chromebook, if it's a different model.\n\nThat little white square at the end of the pink tab is the jumper (it's under a black tab that you'll have to peel off); you can probably bridge it with a bit of solder, if you want it permanent. I used a piece of aluminium foil.\nSoftware\nOnce you have done this, you'll need to reboot your Chromebook, open your browser, then press ctrl+alt+t to open the shell. \nMAKE SURE YOU READ LEWIS'S SUPPORTED MODELS MATRIX\nOnce you have read the developer's supported models matrix, you can run the following command in the Crosh shell as a normal user not root\nCommand\ncd;bash <(curl https://johnlewis.ie/flash_cb_fw.sh)\n\nLast Bit\nFinally, follow the on-screen instructions according to your model and what the matrix says it supports. \nOnce you have done all of this, you will be able to install an OS from USB to your SSD, run an OS from live USB, or, now, again, I'm not sure how this works so you should do some research (I couldn't find much when I was looking), you can boot from payload which, I think install an operating system of your choice from the ones available.\nNote\nOn a C710 Chromebook, I know the touch pad won't work (I'm working on installing the Ubuntu-modified ChromeOS drivers) and neither will the brightness keys, volume, reload-page button, etc. I'm not sure what the issue is there yet, but I am working on it and, if you do what I've said here, and want the drivers/keyboard-fix-stuff, ping me and I'll edit those into the answer once I've figured it all out. I don't know what will/won't work on other models.\nThis will wipe everything on your computer so I recommend transferring any files you have to some cloud storage system or to a flashdrive or something.\n", "Q: How to tell if I successfully use RAID I configured RAID on our server and I installed Ubuntu 16.04.

However, pymorph does exist in PyPI. The best way to install pymorph is to use pip inside a virtualenv; I would avoid using sudo pip because it is best to get apt manage your system packages and not let pip interfere with that. Assuming you are using Ubuntu 16.04 and Python 2, the code to install pymorph properly is:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install virtualenv\ncd ~/<desired directory>  # cd to desired directory\nvirtualenv venv  # create virtualenv named venv for Python 2\nsource venv/bin/activate  # activate virtualenv\npip install -U pip  # upgrade pip\npip install pymorph\n\nIf you are using older versions of Ubuntu, replace apt with apt-get. If you want to use Python 3, replace virtualenv venv with virtualenv venv -p python3.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install pymorph fails because pymorph does not exist as package in the apt sources.\nIf you want to know whether a package exists or not, you can run apt-cache search [packagename].

GCC is a key\n  component of the GNU toolchain. The Free Software Foundation (FSF)\n  distributes GCC under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC\n  has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a\n  tool and an example.\nOriginally named the GNU C Compiler, when it only handled the C\n  programming language, GCC 1.0 was released in 1987. It was extended\n  to compile C++ in December of that year. Front ends were later\n  developed for Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go\n  among others.\nGCC has been ported to a wide variety of processor architectures, and\n  is widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and\n  proprietary software. GCC is also available for most embedded\n  platforms,[citation needed] including Symbian (called gcce), AMCC,\n  and Freescale Power Architecture-based chips. The compiler can\n  target a wide variety of platforms, including video game consoles such\n  as the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast.\nAs well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system,\n  GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern\n  Unix-like computer operating systems, including Linux and the BSD\n  family, although FreeBSD and OS X have moved to the LLVM system.\n  Versions are also available for Microsoft Windows and other operating\n  systems; GCC can compile code for Android and iOS.\n\n\nA: GCC is GNU C (language) compiler. It's used to \"convert\" programs written in C programming language into binary executable on computer.\nThe syntax gcc -o sample sample.c means:\nCompile the file sample.c and name the output sample.\nThen you can launch your compiled program with <path_to_file>/sample, or from within the directory ./sample\nThe default name for compiled program is a.out, so with -o parameter you can specify your desired output name.\n", "Q: Replacing Thunar in Xubuntu I installed nemo and deleted Thunar in Xubuntu 14.04.

Does crouton or native install work fine? I searched for a low priced MacBook Air alternative with retina resolution and found HP Chromebook 13\n\nAt 12.95mm/.51in, the amazingly thin and light HP Chromebook 13\n  provides professionals a simple, secure, and easily managed\n  cloud-based experience.  Built for collaboration, this agile performer\n  has a host of accessories1 to help enhance productivity.\nStarting at $499.00\n\nI don't wish to use Google spyware (privacy nightmare). In the first few months I wish to use Chromium OS Universal Chroot Environment, crouton and later install Ubuntu native.\nIs there a an ad blocking mechanism available for Chrome native web browser?\nDoes crouton work with this device? Will Ubuntu be installable on this device (hardware specs) after a few months (I hope there will be tutorials and howtos)?\nI am completely new to Chromebooks, what's your experience with Ubuntu on Chromebooks?\n\nA: Crouton will work, and installing Ubuntu Desktop via Crouton is easy. However: you will have Chrome OS running \"in the background\" and it'll be used for all the low level hardware stuff. The Ubuntu Desktop is more or less running as an App on top of Chrome OS. Also note that Crouton requires developer mode, and that (sadly) disables the bootloader signature verification.\nBy the way: screen scaling (aka pixel doubling) on the Ubuntu Desktop works okay-ish. Be prepared to run into Apps that don't work without some tinkering (unfortunately, Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox were among them last time I checked).\nInstalling Ubuntu natively on Chromebooks is fraught with difficulties and incompatibilities, but you can certainly make it work if you don't mind a little tinkering. On some Chromebooks, there are audio driver problems, adjusting screen brightness may not work, the touchscreens have always been kind of a hack to get working, you may have (very annoying) power management issues... The list goes on.\nI run a minimal Ubuntu installation via Crouton that I only access from the command line. For everything else, I use Google Spyware (i.e. Chrome, which I would have installed anyway). And that setup, if you can live with the privacy nightmare, works absolutely wonderfully.\nYou can install Chromium OS, the open source spyware, but I've never got it working properly. They make it really difficult, with so-so support for new hardware and an installation procedure that's, shall we say, not easy.\nSo in summary: Crouton works like a dream, native Ubuntu installs are probably worse than they would be on a ThinkPad, a MacBook Pro, or a Dell XPS, and it's kind of difficult to get rid of Google Chrome OS.\n\nA: Crouton runs not bad on Chromebooks and I have been using it with HP Chromebook 14 (14.04 with XFCE). \nThere are some issues however,\n\n\n*\n\n*Runs under Developer mode : Since crouton works only under developer mode, security is an issue. You will get a white screen saying that system is in Developer mode when booting in. (This is a risk since somebody can wipe out the system in that stage !)\n\n*Switching between OSs : The shortcuts for on the go switching between ChromeOS and Ubuntu may not work. (They do not work for me). The alternative is to log-off from Ubuntu and go back to ChromeOS.\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts : Volume, screen brightness may not work by default. Though they work in my case.\n\n*Ubuntu native shortcuts : May not work. You may need to set some of them separately.\n\n*Installing additional programs : The default programs like Libre Office, File Roller, Audio Player, etc.. are not installed and you have to install them separately. This is advantage since it saves lots of space, but then more extra job is to be done to get things ready.\nI have mentioned some more details in my other post here\nApart from this, crouton is stable, can access the same folders as ChromeOS and otherwise works fine (atleast for me). \n", "Q: Wrongly named variables in mysqld.cnf (Ubuntu 16.04) Recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 and found that the default configuration file for MySQL has a few wrongly named variables, i.e. system variables whose name has changed over versions.\nIn the file /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf there are the following lines:\ntable_cache            = 64\nlog_slow_queries = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log\nlog-queries-not-using-indexes\n\nThe current version of MySQL in use requires these to be named:\ntable_open_cache\nslow_query_log_file\nlog_queries_not_using_indexes\n\nRespectively.

I downloaded and installed LibreOffice 5.2.0 beta2 as described in LibreOffice 5.2.0 beta2 as a snap package. It weighed in at 1015 MiB.\nThere will certainly be more updates before the RC is out. My question is this: will snap packages get differential (delta) updates or will the entire snap package, 1 GiB in this case, have to be downloaded each time?\n(BTW: this version fixes the long-standing vanishing clipboard content issue!)\nPostscript question: I want to know if I can delete libreoffice_5.2.0.0.beta2_amd64.snap, the 1 GiB \"source\" file, or must it remain on the system for the delta updates to work?\n\nA: This OMG! Ubuntu article says delta:\n\nNewer Apps, Larger\nOne side-effect of the ‘bundle’ approach is, naturally, a larger\n  initial package size.\nBut Snaps are clever; transactional and delta updates allows devs to\n  only upgrade the parts that need updating, be it a single lib, an app\n  icon, or the entire freaking thing.\n\nThe documentation on Snappy Ubuntu Core also mentions these points:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*The OS and application files are kept completely separate, as a set of distinct read-only images.\n  \n*Transactional, image-based delta updates for the system and applications that can always be rolled back.\n  \n*These files are read-only, which means they cannot be tampered with and can be updated perfectly and predictably every time.\n  \n*Signatures and fingerprints ensure you’re running exactly what was published by the developer, no funny business even if the bits came\n  from the internet.\n  \n*Delta management keeps the size of downloads to the bare minimum.\n  \n\n\nA: We changed the format of snaps in 16.04, to a newer, more compact and more secure format. We have to add back delta updates in the new format, it will come soon. Also, we will add back auto-gardening so that old snap will be removed automatically in future, but you can safely delete it now yourself.\n\nA: And now it's here.

I suspect this happened because of some change in udev or in the kernel between Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04. I know this because I wrote that file and it worked fine in 15.10, but the bug only happened in 16.04.\nToday (August), I finally updated the repository with the fix (even though the fix was proposed in May). This fix will be added to the Debian and Ubuntu packages sometime in the future.\nWant to learn even more about it? Look at the udev-joystick-blacklist project on GitHub. (Disclaimer: I created that project.)\nHow to fix it?\nOption 1 (the lazy one)\nJust wait until an update to the joystick package is released.\nOption 2 (the non-gamer one)\nYou can just remove that blacklist file:\nsudo rm /lib/udev/rules.d/51-these-are-not-joysticks-rm.rules\n\nWhenever the package gets updated or reinstalled, the file should be recreated.\nOption 3 (the gamer one)\nYou can manually update that file with a new version from the repository. However, pay attention to updates to the joystick package. I'm not sure if any update will just overwrite the file, or if the update will ask for the user to merge the file.\n", "Q: Cairo-deck isn't starting up automatically why?

The problem is that I don't know which file I should download. I've taken a look at this page: www.ubuntu.com/download/server/arm. Does that mean that I can only use Ubuntu server for ARM with those types of cpu's?\n\nA: Unfortunately unlike the x86 world the arm world doesn't have a common \"platform\".\nPCs all boot in the same way (well one of two ways since we have UEFI), they have crucial system hardware like timers in the same place. They all have the registers used to enumerate the PCI bus(es) in the same place. They have a BIOS that passes further details of the hardware to the OS.\nArm boards don't, each SoC is very different and the boards they are installed on are often different too. At a minimum you tend to need a board-specific bootloader and \"dtb\". Sometimes you also need a board-specific kernel, especially if you want full functionality.\nWhat tends to end up happening is that only a small selection of hardware is officially supported by the distro, then the community around each given board puts together unofficial images for their boards.\nThe exception to this is arm server hardware. The arm server folks have adapted UEFI and ACPI to arm, providing a more PC like experience.\n", "Q: CPUs are overused with internet browsers, maybe Ubuntu+i5+JS don's work well I'm having trouble with the Ubuntu 14.04 on PCs Intel NUC i5 8 GB RAM SSD HD.\nThey are used mostly with Google Spreadhseets and are high usage of internet browsers and JS applications.\nPCs are quite well resourced in CPU, RAM and HD but they are not working properly since occasionally there are peaks of CPU usage that freezes the computer.

I'm trying to use KMail from KDE4, but with XFCE4 panel instead of Plasma panel. So far I get most of the icons from other applications, but no icon from KMail.\nIt seems it's because KMail uses KSystemNotifierItem, which requires special support from the panel system tray applet, and it looks like XFCE4 panel doesn't support it.\nHow do I make this work? Is there any way to enable SNI support for XFCE4 panel (if it's not there already)?\n\nA: OK, so this problem happens only when using KMail+XFCE4 panel in KDE session. KStatusNotifier appears to be smart, and somehow checks whether it's in KDE, and bases its mechanism on this. So to have KMail work correctly with XFCE4 panel in KDE session, we have to trick KMail into thinking that it's not in KDE:\nenv -i HOME=$HOME DISPLAY=$DISPLAY kmail\n\nThe above command clears the environment and only saves HOME and DISPLAY variables before running kmail. These variables are basically all what are needed for KMail to work properly without KDE session support.\nActually this is true not only for KMail, but for virtually any KDE application with a system tray icon: KTorrent, Amarok, etc.. The above trick should work for all of them (maybe adding more variables if needed).\n\nA: Ruslan's answer works.  But this leaves kmail running without a window manager. However, in kmail 5.7.0, under settings/configure kmail.../general there is a \"System tray\" panel with a checkbox for \"Enable system tray icon\".

Please consider switching to mysqld --initialize\n2016-06-15 18:40:36 [ERROR]   The data directory needs to be specified.\n\nHow can I complete the setup? I have successfully followed the same procedure several times in the past on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Installation of the MySQL server involves roughly three steps: 1) unpacking the software; 2) creating a default database; 3) creating a default user/password (and storing this in the database). \nShould you accidentally lose the database files (usually located in /var/lib/mysql) then you can start again without completely reinstalling the server package. This is done with the command mysqld --initialize. If you run this command while a database is already in place, it will report an error (\"File exists\") and it won't attempt to overwrite the database. However, if you're unsure if the installation procedure has completed correctly, it's OK to delete the directory /var/lib/mysql and re-initialize the database.\nThe --initialize flag will cause MySQL to generate a root user and a random password, which is then written to the log file. For more information, see man mysqld.\n\nA: First check the version of Mysql using mysql --version.\nIf you have version 5.7.6 or later, the data directory would be initialized automatically and no need for running sudo mysql_install_db.\nsome more info on installing mysql on DigitalOcean server is on https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04\n", "Q: help understanding sudo -s I was trying out a command yesterday that put my computer into hibernation mode.

So [^\\\"] means any character except literal double quote. So \"[^\"]*\" means a double quote, followed by a sequence of zero or more characters except double quote, followed by the closing double quote.\nNote that the backslash escapes are only required because you've used double quotes around the expression - you could simplify that to\ngrep -o 'temp=\"[^\"]*\"' ~/.cache/weather.xml\n\nIf you want it to output just the numeric temperature reading, you can use a Perl-compatible RE instead\ngrep -Po 'temp=\"\\K[^\"]*'\n\n\nA: this means - skip an occurrence of double quote.\n\n\ngrep -o -> Show only the part of a matching line that matches PATTERN.\n* -> this means 0 or more, hence getting 103\n\\\" -> the last double quote in temp=\"103\"\n\n\n", "Q: Sync guest folder to host machine in vagrant I want to sync a folder from my guest system ( which is ubuntu ) to my local system.

There are two common, if convoluted, workarounds for this. You either add a grep -v grep at the end of the pipe, or you use grep [f]oo instead. Since grep works with regular expressions, it will treat [f] as \"any character in the list of characters inside the brackets\". Since the only character in the brackets is f, [f]oo is equivalent to foo. However, the grep process showing up in the ps results will have the string [f]oo and is, therefore, not found by grep. \nThis becomes more complicated if, as seems to be the case for you, you have a file called foo in your current directory. Because you haven't quoted the expression you gave to grep (because you used [s]elenium and not '[s]elenium' or \"[s]elenium\"), the shell will treat it as a glob and expand it to the matching file name. This renders the [s]elenium trick useless since what is actually passed to grep is selenium and not [s]elenium so the grep will match itself. \nAll this, however, only happens because you're not using the right tool for the job. As is so often the case, there's an app for that! \nDon't use grep + ps. Instead, use pgrep which is designed to do precisely what you want:\nNAME\n       pgrep,  pkill  -  look  up  or signal processes based on name and other\n       attributes\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       pgrep [options] pattern\n       pkill [options] pattern\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       pgrep looks through the  currently  running  processes  and  lists  the\n       process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All the cri‐\n       teria have to match.  For example,\n\n         $ pgrep -u root sshd\n\nSo, in your case, you can just do\npgrep selenium\n\nOr, since you're running it via java, use -f which searches through the entire command line:\npgrep -f selenium\n\n\nA: I guess you have a file named selenium.jar but no file called selenium in your current folder. \nIf you run \n ps aux | grep [s]elenium.jar\n\nthe shell will try to replace [s]elenium.jar with matching files names from the current folder. If there is a file called selenium.jar that will match and [s]elenium.jar will be replaced by selenium.jar.\nThe shell will then execute the command with the replaced value, i.e.\nps aux | grep selenium.jar\n\nTo avoid this quote the regex to protect it from the shell:\nps aux | grep '[s]elenium.jar'\n\n\nA: You could exclude the \"grep\" after the initial grep:\nps aux | grep '[s]elenium.jar' | grep -v grep\n\n", "Q: Issues while upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to 16.04 My computer crashed during the upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 and since then I receive this message when I get to the command line.This is the command I used for the upgrade\nsudo update-manager -d\n\nHow can I resolve this?\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\n\nA: This might be frowned upon, but you could try deleting the lock file... then re-attempting the upgrade:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\n\nA: you can delete the lock file with the following command:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\nYou may also need to delete the lock file in the cache directory\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nAfter that, try opening Synaptic again. \n", "Q: Do I have to create a new snap package everytime a dependency gets a security update? If I create a snap package with lets say 5 dependencies. Do I have to create a new package version everytime a dependency gets a (security) update?\nI mean the advantage of .deb packages is that in Ubuntu/Debian for example I can use a library and once that library gets an update that means an update for a part of my software too. And as they only submit security updates I can be (99%) sure that the library update will not break the API so that my software could break.\n\nA: The short answer is yes, you'll need to rebuild your snap if you need to update a dependency. However, there's a longer answer here, too.\nSay you have some application that uses SSL (could be some embedded software or a full-blown website using Apache). You do your research and utilize specific key exchange and symmetric algorithms. Now say a security vulnerability was discovered in SSL, and a new version was released. Just because it's a security release doesn't mean the patched vulnerability was in one of the algorithms you used. What if it wasn't? What if, by patching that vulnerability in an algorithm you didn't use, something you did use was broken or compromised (happened to me recently with PHP)? If you're bundling it you can make the call about whether or not you need to upgrade on a use-by-use basis. You can also test it extensively before rolling it out to all your users. There's also the possibility that the distribution you're targeting has a different version of SSL that doesn't work with your piece of software, where bundling it in the snap provides for a common experience across platforms.\nThere's definitely a trade off between the benefits of sharing dependencies and the benefits of bundling them.\n", "Q: Colouring terminal output in 14.04 like in 16.04 I've turned my dual-boot into a triple-boot and I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 as well as Ubuntu Gnome 14.04.\nI've noticed that the terminal output of 14.04 is only coloured for directories.

I have set up mouse keys to run on it, but then here's where I run into the issue. \nUpon startup, I login, and you can't do anything with the mouse keys unless the cursor is visible.

For example, sudo apt-get install oxygen-cursor-theme and set it in gnome-tweak tool.\n\nA: no. The solution is not to change your icon theme.\nThe problem is that your cursor theme does not have some of the icons.\nTo fix BMZ cursor theme, for example, use this: https://gist.github.com/dylnmc/a6b880c1b0bbeb75f2a6218e3eef3121\nYou basically need to copy at least one of the files in /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/cursors/ (I just picked this cursor theme because when I changed to it in gnome-tweak-tool, gnome did not crash) to your cursor theme in /usr/share/icons/***/cursors/ where *** represents the name of your cursor.\nI don't know which icon it is, so I just copied everything that doesn't exist in BMZ from /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/cursors/ to /usr/share/icons/BMZ/cursors/, as you can read in the gist above.\n\nA: I had also this problem whit some cursor themes and changed to the default and it worked. But I wanted to use a more stylish cursor theme and I'm actually using one that works fine, no more crashes and really good design:\nClick here to see how it looks like (\"La Capitaine\" cursor theme)\nInstallation steps:\n1) Copy git repository    \ngit clone https://github.com/keeferrourke/capitaine-cursors.git\n\n2) Change to the copied directory from git\ncd capitaine-cursors\n\n3) Create directory to allocate the cursor theme\nsudo mkdir /usr/share/icons/capitaine-cursors\n\n4) Copy the content of bin/xcursor into the created directory\nsudo cp -pr bin/xcursor /usr/share/icons/capitaine-cursors\n\n\nA: I prefer to start with an empty installation and add what I need; doing so left me with this bug.

I am looking to copy the keyboard shortcuts file to another PC to avoid re-binding the keys again. I am using Ubuntu Gnome 16.04. \nIn Xubuntu there is a simple location with the keyboard shortcuts in a file in ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml.  You can copy and paste this file to another computer, and you have all your familiar keyboard shortcuts. Is there an equivalent file in Ubuntu Gnome?\n\nA: GNOME stores its settings in the dconf binary database which can also be viewed or changed with the gsettings command line tool or the dconf-editor app.\nThe database is stored in ~/.config/dconf/user . You can copy that file to another computer to copy all of your GNOME settings including your keyboard shortcuts. That folder is hidden by default. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+H to view hidden folders.\nOther apps store their settings in other parts of the ~/.config folder or directory.\n\nA: Also here.\nSave custom keyboard shortcuts\nYou can save/backup/export custom shortcuts/keybindings using just dconf and sed\nExport\ndconf dump / | sed -n '/\\[org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys/,/^$/p' > custom-shortcuts.conf # Export\n\nThe difference with the usual answer is that this will hold on the file the path to the dconf settings, making it easier to import, just dconf load / < file.\nImport\ndconf load / < custom-shortcuts.conf # Import\n\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*Based on Ciro's answer (also here)\n\n\n*Only for the added custom shortcuts\n\n\n*Note that dconf only dumps non-default values\n\n\n*To backup, you may want to use custom-shortcuts-$(date -I).conf\n\n\n*Test if it works by resetting to defaults before the import\ngsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys\n\n", "Q: Why do snap-packages exist - is there a real need? Assumptions\nHonestly, I do not know much about  snap-packages - but this is irrelevant for this question - see below. I assume the system is significantly different from the existing one.\nDoes the change make sense?\nIs there an actual need, strong enough? That is - is there a new use case, that is important enough to develop a new format - and the associated infrastructure?\nWas it not feasible to change the current method to cover the new use cases too?\nOr am I missing the point?\nIt is possible that what I see is mostly marketing - new names and presentation for minimal technical change, to get a chance that any body assumes it as \"new and better\" and it may be actually used. Also, it may be that the new packages are so closely based on the existing format that it is mostly a change in presentation to the user. That could be a good solution, of course. In this case, this question would have not much relevance.\nThen, I would hope that is still useful enough to answer to side aspects. \nJust let me know if the question is not helpful or confusing to new users, I'm happy to delete it.\nSo, why do they exist?\n\nBackground\nMy first reaction was \"That makes no sense!\"\nThis is similar to a situation where, on the physics site, someone asked, unhappy, why nobody discusses his brilliant new ideas in answers. It looked strongly like crackpot ideas; So far from actual physical knowledge that it was hard to find a point to even start. I wrote an answer that did not touch his ideas with a single word, but explained why one would just not discuss assuming crackpot ideas - not the first case of that. The answer was actually hitting the point, I think.  \nIf my assumptions were right, this case is similar.  \nBut then, maybe not - let's see.\n\nA: One particular feature of snaps which might be useful is the ability to choose a channel for developers that provide more than one channel, such as release, candidate, master, etc.\nFor example, clicking the Channel button for nextcloud will show the dialog in the screenshot below.\nThe other strong selling points are isolation, immutability, and sandboxing which are controlled by a security policy context, which allows defining per-app permissions, also called 'plugs' for e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*read/write locations\n\n*access to removable storage\n\n*countries where the snap is whitelisted/blacklisted\n\n*network access\n\n*camera, printer, joystick, GPS location\n\n*system settings\n\n*...full list of snap interfaces\nThe approach mimics to some degree the MacOS app bundles and Android's app sandboxing with permissions and content providers/receivers.\n\nNow, imagine you need to run a dozen of apps each with its own version of certain libraries, its own version of Python/Ruby/NodeJS runtime and you don't want to run into dependency hell and mess up or pollute your system libraries, your system Python/Node/Perl/Ruby modules, etc..\nReal-life use cases\n\n*\n\n*On a raspberry pi 4 the latest version of PHP available in the repos is 7.3 and if you by chance need to run something that requires a higher version (e.g. a newer version of nextcloud) then you would have to find a way to do it bypassing the ootb package manager, which in turn might break other packages or cause instability. Running nextcloud as a snap lets you run the version you want no matter what dependencies you have installed by default via the system package manager. Moreover, the snap has the option to autoupdate itself which can also come in handy.\n\n\n*you need to run concurrently different versions of the same web-server, for example, apache2, nginx or caddy because you have multiple apps each requiring a specific version.\n\nA: Yes, there is a real need.\nThere has been a real need for something like this since the first time one software depended on another.\nLet's make this clear:\nManaging dependencies is hard.\nThere's a reason why it's called dependency hell. Packaging systems like RPM and Debian were created with the intent of avoiding dependency hell. However, somebody must pay the cost:\n\n\n*\n\n*On Windows, where programs bundle their dependencies, the user has to take care of upgrades (and any security problems from lack thereof). If I the dev want version X of something for my app, simple: I provide it with my app. Now how do I handle updates?\n\n*On most Linux distros (following Debian or Red Hat), where a program can depend on software from the repository, a program from the repository must depend on software from the repository. If I want version X of something for my app, and the distro provides X, simple: I depend on it. And if the distro doesn't? Then: ???\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding multiple versions to the distro increases the load on the maintainer\n\n*Losing the ability to use the version of choice of dependencies increases the load on the developer\n\n*Losing the ability to use the version of choice of applications frustrate the user\n\n\n\nThere is a considerable loss of freedom in either method.\nAnd this is where snaps come in: they let the dev include version X, and let the packaging system manage updates. Who pays the cost? The user:\n\n\n*\n\n*by requiring more space.\n\n*by putting them at risk due to a careless dev not rebuilding their snaps when a dependency is patched.\n\n\nWhat benefits do I get, in exchange?\n\n\n*\n\n*Aside from security via updates (which, frankly, not enough people care about), I the user don't have to worry about dependencies with snaps. The word mostly loses meaning.\n\n*Aside from security updates, the software developer doesn't need to worry about getting users to install the correct dependencies.\n\n", "Q: Problems understanding how set works Can someone please help me understand the following code segment?\nset -- ${BACKUPDIR}/backup-???.tgz\nlastname=${!#}\nbackupnr=${lastname##*backup-}\nbackupnr=${backupnr%%.*}\nbackupnr=${backupnr//\\?/0}\nbackupnr=$[10#${backupnr}]\n\nI found it in this backup script \nhttps://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Skripte/inkrementelles_Backup/ \nwhere it is used to get the number of the filename of the last stored backup. The filenames of the backups are \"backup-ccc.tgz\" where ccc is a three digit number that is incremented every time a new backup is created.\nI do understand lines three and four they cut off the rest of the filename so just the needed part with the number is left. What I don't get is how the first two lines are working. I read the manpage of set but now I'm confused more then I had been before. What does the command set -- filename do? Also what exactly is the option ${!#} for, that is being stored in lastname. I think ${} is to dereference a given parameter, but which parameter does the option !# point to?\nSecondly I don't get why I need the command in line 5. As I understand this is used to replace all question marks with an 0 that are stored in the variable backupnr, but why is this done? If there hasn't been an error in the commands before backupnr should be a three digit number, if there has been an error and the content of the variable is corrupt, you can't know what is the actual value of backupnr. So if I want to scan for corruption why don't I have to scan for everything thats not a number, but just for a question mark? Is this maybe somehow related to whats happening in the first two lines?\n\nA: set is often used to set the positional parameters ($1, $2, $3, etc., which are usually provided as arguments to the script). By using these parameters, we can get a simple way to count things via the $# variable, which stores the number of set positional parameters.\n? is a wildcard matching any single character, so ??? matches any combination of three characters.\nCombined: set -- ${BACKUPDIR}/backup-???.tgz sets every file named backup-xxx.tgz, where xxx are any three characters, as the parameters.\n${!#}, uses variable indirection:\n\nIf the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), it\n  introduces a level of variable indirection. Bash uses the value of the\n  variable formed from the rest of parameter as the name of the\n  variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the\n  rest of the substitution, rather than the value of parameter itself.\n  This is known as indirect expansion.\n\nSince $#, which is what you get when you remove the !, is the count of parameters (and the number of the last parameter), ${!#} is a simple way to get the last argument.\n\nAs for command 5, what happens when no matching files are present?\n$ bash -c 'set -- backup-???.tgz; echo \"$@\"'\nbackup-???.tgz\n\nThe shell leaves that word alone, so now we have just a literal backup-???.tgz. The author handles that edge case by replacing the ? with 0, to mark the first backup file.\n"]
