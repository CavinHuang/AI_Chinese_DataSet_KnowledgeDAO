["Q: Safari not displaying text I have a fresh Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) install, with every update available installed, on a iMac (2011). Safari (9.0) is acting up. Firefox is working just as it should.\nI have tried the usual suspects, disk repair and deleting the cache to no avail. I have but a few apps installed, Logic X and a couple of other music apps, but the system is super fresh, it should not act up like this. Any ideas?\n\n\nA: I would recommend clearing your font cache using OnyX and rebooting to clear things up.\n", "Q: Shortcut - El Capitan Dialog Box switch between option How do we switch between options in confirm dialog boxes on El Capitan.\nOlder OSXs was switching by using spacebar.

I'm using the smallest scaling so 1650x1050\nEdit: Changing the scaling didn't fix the problem.\n\nA: Apple designs the screens to leave a gap between the top window and the menu bar (especially noticeable with a dark menu bar and a bright background image) and also maintains a gap between the physical bottom of the screen and the window.\nIf I were to guess, it's to preserve shadows and \"depth\" of the interface and they made a conscious decision to implement windowing this way.\nYou might have to file some bug reports and gather use cases for how this is bad to get them to reverse this decision. It's hard to unsee once you notice it, but I don't think it's just a bug in their code.\n\nA: The gap at the bottom of the window happens when your Dock is placed at the bottom of the screen and hidden. If it is visible, there is no gap, and if the Dock is placed to the side of the screen, the gap appears on that side when it is hidden.\nI'm not aware of any way to disable this behavior, but it has been present in OS X for some time.\nIf you are looking for maximum window size, you could try Full Screen mode, which fills the entire screen with the contents of the window, and even hides the menu and title bars. \n", "Q: Extremely poor bulk file copy speeds on AFP shares in Yosemite Some hardware background: I manage a 3D graphics lab of about a dozen iMac clients running 10.10.5 and a Mini running Server 10.10.2 (Server.app v4.0.3 / build 14S350). The Mini is in a Sonnet xMac enclosure, which connects it via Thunderbolt to an Areca ARC-1883X SAS RAID controller and a SmallTree P2E10G-1-T 10Gb Ethernet card. The Areca manages two 40TB SAS RAIDs and the SmallTree card connects the Mini via Cat6a to a NetGear ProSafe XS708E 10GbE switch. The iMacs are all wired over 1GbE Cat6 to an HP 1810-48G switch, which is in turn connected over a 6Gb trunk to the NetGear switch.\nMy artists have been running into an issue with bulk file copies between directories of the AFP share on the Mini that they work out of. They frequently render sequences of hundreds or thousands of images, and after these images get rendered to their output folder they then have to be copied to a second directory for our compositors to work with. The copy operation absolutely CRAWLS. One example, from a half hour ago: 861 .exr files, totaling about 350MB, took about 3 hours before we killed it at ~75% and instead did it from the server's desktop via screen sharing in about 30 seconds (But our artists do this dozens of times a day and of course can't be given access to screen share with the server, so this is not a solution). They don't always hang like that, but we run into such a case at least once every day and all bulk copies go way slower than they should. This only happens with large groups of files: We can copy a single 300MB file between directories pretty much instantaneously.\nI've done some tests, and this appears to be a Yosemite client issue more than anything. I run Mountain Lion on my own laptop and did some tests, in 10.8 and 10.10, on wifi and wired ethernet, and in both local and network profiles since our artists sign into network accounts. Some limited results for 300 .exr files totaling 133MB:\n10.8 / Wifi / Local profile: 300 items copy in 53 sec\n10.8 / Wired / Local profile: 300 items copy in 47 sec\n10.10 / Wired / Local profile: 300 items copy in 223 sec\n10.10 / Wired / Network profile: 300 items copy in 263 sec\nNetwork accounts are slightly slower, but the big egregious difference seems to be 10.8 client vs 10.10 client. Again, the problem is with long lists of files and not with single monolithic files. Our straight up ethernet speeds to the server are fantastic: In both 10.8 and 10.10 Blackmagic Speed Test I get 110MB/sec+ read and write to the server, and only slightly slower on Wireless N wifi. This only becomes an issue when we need to copy long lists of files, which we need to do many times a day.\nANY help to figure out what's going wrong here would be much appreciated! This is driving us absolutely insane at this point and is killing productivity. Happy to post any requested logs or attempt any suggested system tweaks. Thank you!\n\nA: Here's how I would attack the issue. It's not an answer, but hopefully we can crowd source ideas until you can report success or at least a way to measure things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a test case client with no third party apps running at log in. Reboot that client and mount the network share. Run sudo sysdiagnose Finder before you start a copy.\n\n*Start a tcp trace on the network adapter you will copy the file. If you aren't connecting over en0 - use System Information to see the BSD name of the network connection. \n\n*Once the trace is started, start the copy of the file in question.\n\n*After 3 minutes (or less if the transfer is done sooner), press Control+C to end the capture\n\n*Run a second sudo sysdiagnose Finder after the network capture\n\n\nWith this slow of a transfer speed, something seriously amiss is happening in the network stack, but without looking at the client logs, it's going to be hard to know for sure what's halting the operation. You might also run a sysdiagnose on the server side once at about the same time as you do on the client side to eliminate a slow server as the issue. It seems you have plenty of horsepower for the storage to move rapidly, but getting server side logs will help too:\nsudo sysdiagnose\nsudo /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serverdiagnose\n\nThe trace is:\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -s 0 -B 524288 -w ~/Desktop/AFPslow.pcap\n\n\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut :: Remove Google Chrome Bookmark I keep accidentally typing Command + D in Google Chrome, because I'm used to that taking me to the Address Bar on Windows systems.

I need to find out if there are OSX/iOS caching servers on a bunch of different networks - and put in a caching server where needed. But since the caching service on a Mac server is pretty black box, there isn't much information available on how it works.\nI know that if I have access to a server, it's trivial to check if caching is on in the server software. I'm looking for, say, a port to scan, or a flag that gets set on client devices' App Stores that can be checked, or something in firewall logs to look for. There is just so little information out there I can't say exactly where to start.\nI have remote access to at least a headless Mac Mini on each network.\n\nA: Not directly before Sierra on macOS.\nOn Sierra and later, run the AssetCacheLocatorUtil from any unix shell (in terminal or other app)\nWe have even found a way to tell after the fact whether an update came from the cache or from Apple on the client side by looking at the logs instead of sniffing network connections and traffic.\n\nHere are the Sierra and later details.\nQuery Apple's update infrastructure and check if any local caching points for updates, app downloads, and/or iCloud data are present and it also checks for connectivity and service\nAssetCacheLocatorUtil\n\nThe manual page is quite well written and covers a lot of the details. Below are some observations from before this tool was around to help.\nThe servers listen on somewhat randomized ports - my two caching servers are currently listening on ports 49558 and 51858\nI suppose you could port scan all the servers and try to deduce which ones are using OS X server in general and then exhaustively probe all the higher ports on the presumption that a single higher port open might be a caching server.\nYou can request a server to tell you the port it's running:\nsudo serveradmin fullstatus caching | grep Port\n\nThe clients check in with Apple directly, Apple notices the public IP address from which the requites came. It then makes two checks:\n\n*\n\n*what servers have checked in and are running from that same public IP address\n\n*are there PRS records in public DNS for the public IP address the client has used and if another caching server could serve that IP address.\n\nIt then responds to the client to request the asset from the server(s) that are local to the IP. If that caching server doesn't have the asset, it requests it and passes it on to the client. If the client doesn't get it's assets, there is a retry mechanism to get the asset directly from Apple's CDN so you don't always get things from the caching servers in my experience.\nYou also might be able to make a list of servers that have remote access enabled - listening on port 311/asip-webadmin or by collecting the status of each server periodically:\nsudo serveradmin settings info | grep enableRemoteAdministration\n\n\nA: Open a terminal and give AssetCacheLocatorUtil a try - I think it was just introduced in Sierra.\n NAME\n         AssetCacheLocatorUtil -- Utility for reporting Caching Service information\n\n    SYNOPSIS\n         AssetCacheLocatorUtil\n\n    DESCRIPTION\n         AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports information related to OS X Server Caching Servers running on the machine or on the local network.\n\n         The information that AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports depends on the user running it.

I am trying to get rid of approximately 3GB of imessage attachments, by deleting the attachments from the backup file, and then restoring from that backup. My phone is an iphone 5, running iOS 7.1.2. And I do not want to upgrade to iOS 9. Will I be ok restoring it? Or is there an alternative message to free up some space? Thanks\n\nA: My personal recommendation would be to jailbreak your iPhone and download a Cydia application called iCleaner, which is specifically-intended to free up space on your device by clearing junk files.  It even has the exact option that you seem to be  looking for -- to delete message attachments.  It has multiple options for this -- to delete ALL message attachments, or SMART (which I'm not 100% certain what this does, but you could look into it).  iCleaner is pretty much the equivalent of CCleaner for iOS.\nI do know for a fact that all messages and attachments are stored in a SQLite database that requires root access.  Your Messages application only shows the previous [however many] messages from individual contacts, but you can see that you can go back to previous history by scrolling all the way to the top and refreshing (swiping down).  Many people don't realize that  if they keep their messages, they are taking up valuable storage space on their phone, because this includes all attachments (including photos, video, etc.).\nThe following is only speculation, but my assumption is that iCleaner's SMART option only deletes the old attachments that are not currently visible in your current message history -- the old stuff that is still contained in the database, but which you don't have access to unless you scroll all the way up and refresh (by swiping down) to see older messages.\nTo answer your specific question, if you have done a full backup to iTunes rather than iCloud, you would be able to restore your phone to exactly that previous state, including iOS version and would avoid having to upgrade.\n", "Q: Unable to run Postgres after Installation on OSX - El Capitan I just used homebrew to install my postgres, and I am unable to start it after attempting to start it with the suggested command from postgres/brew.\n\nCan someone please advise?\n\nA: First, I would advise running brew doctor to make sure your homebrew installation is still intact.  It will instruct you on changes that need to be made after your upgrade.\nIf you are still having trouble and have database backups or nothing critical that you believe could get broken, I believe an easy fix would be to run something like\nbrew uninstall postgres && brew install postgres\n\nBy default, homebrew recognizes your OS version, and will reinstall from a \"bottle\" specifically-intended for El Capitan, which should fix your particular issue.\nYou could also try brew upgrade postgres (or whatever the equivalent command is).\n\nA: The answer was actually to remove the server.log file and run initdb. This resolved the issue.\nAdditionally, I had to run createdb 'username' to also create my starting postgres database.\n", "Q: How to convert WMV to QuickTime MOV? How can I convert a WMV (Windows Media Video) movie file to QuickTime MOV on OSX El Capitan?\nIf possible I would prefer to use an installed program rather than an online program.\nNeither VLC nor Handbrake can convert WMV to MOV. A Google Search reveals some other options, but I'm dubious about installing these unknown 3rd-party applications without a recommendation from people I trust (ie StackExchange users).\n\nA: Install FFmpeg, e.g., using Homebrew:\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\nFFmpeg is high-quality software for converting video and audio files between different formats.  It does require installing separate software, though.\n\nA: As for recommended way that is subject to opinion.\nAs for doing it with installed applications, this is one way to do it.  This requires 2 applications.  If you really need a MOV file this is how I found to do it.  (If MP4 is suitable then skip step two.)\nStep One\nUsing Handbrake, convert the WMV file to MP4.\nStep Two\nUsing MPEG Streamclip, convert the resulting MP4 to MOV (the process can take considerable time depending on your movie size/length) NOTE: Last update to the software was in 2012. So be aware that it may or may not work well on your system.\nThere are other free converters out there too that can convert MP4 to MOV.  But this 2 step process is what I found to be effective.\nTesting with a WMV file duration of 2m:18s:\nWMV original size: 7.2 MB\nMP4 converted size: 9.7 MB\nMOV resulting size: 14.8 MB\n\nEDIT: As noted by user3439894 in the comments, QuickTime Player will convert MP4 to MOV.

I can change it to any other name, but whenever I try to name it \"LICEcap\", it just reverts right back to its all-lowercase \"licecap\".\nHow can I fix this?\nEDIT: I've discovered something else which may or may not be helpful: If I go into the package contents of the app and change the instances of \"licecap\" in the info.plist file into \"LICEcap\", it lets me rename the app to whatever uppercase/lowercase I want, but corrupts the app (Finder says I should move it to the trash).\n\nA: You cannot change the name because the filesystem is case independent. It is possible to change the filesystem to case dependent, but I would not recommend this.

They still existed on all my iOS devices, but now none of my completions (like ccommand or ooption or sshrug) worked on my laptop. This eventually fixed itself (again for no apparent reason) … but it's just happened again, immediately after purchasing and setting up a new Mac Pro.\nAs this is the second time, I'm starting to wonder if anyone else has seen this behaviour, or if they know how to go about fixing it without waiting on iCloud to Magically Fix Itself, as I did last time?\n\nA: \nAfter removing the folder com.apple.InputMethodKit.TextReplacementService from the depths of the ~/Library heirarchy and restarting the computers my current list of Text Replacement shortcuts is available on two Macs that previously refused to synchronize.

I only use 5 or 6 shortcuts so it was easy.  In the past I've updated the iOS OR the Mac device and my changes were overridden by the other.  So this worked, give it a try.\n\nA: So, this has happened to me twice more (up to four times now, Go Go Apple™! (｡-_-｡), and the same fix that solved this for me when originally asked has worked both times. I'm going to consider it an actual solution, at this point (although do please let me know if it works for you, as well!)\nIf you have another device from which they did not disappear (for example, an iPhone), then leave the settings entirely alone on your computer, and add a single new completion to your iOS device. With any luck, all of your old completions (along with the new one, of course) should magically appear on your desktop machine!\n(Important to note, though, that you may find it difficult to remove substitutions, so don't make your entry something that will trouble you later if you can't remove it! I suggest something like ‘afwrdhd’, that you'll never actually be trying to type.)\n\nA: For me, this was caused by the operation of the Flycut application after establishing confirmation in its \"Save forgotten items to Desktop:\" menu.

This is for Windows if that matters, and is independent of Boot Camp.\nI have more than enough room.I managed to do it once earlier today, but now whenever I try to create the free space partition it automatically formats it to the journaled mac os. I go to disk utility, click on my harddrive, partition, then the plus at the bottom and select free space, resize to 50 GB and apply. and it formats it. Can anyone tell me what is going on?\nTo clarify: when I try to create a partition of \"free space\" using disk utility, it is formatted automatically and against my will to HFS+ Journaled.

I am still trying to install Windows while I am waiting for answers, so it was intentionally added and does not affect my problem.\nEDIT:\nThe partition at index 4 was created using the terminal (but it couldve been created using the plus minus in disk utility), and i have no problems whatsoever creating non-free space partitions with either of these methods. When I tried to install windows to that partition at index 4, I received an error saying that the selected partition is of MBR and i need GPT, which indicates to me some sort of hybrid mode where mac reads gpt and windows reads mbr.\nI got around this error once by creating free space and partitioning/formating it within the windows installer. However I cant make that free space anymore, as i said before i cannot create a partition of format \"free space\" within disk utility.

The partitions with index 2 and 3 are your main OS X volume named Macintosh HD (also visible in the second screenshot) and your Recovery HD. The partition with the index 4 is your NTFS volume WinB (also visible in the second screenshot).\nTrying to add a new partition (by using the +-button) or to resize Macintosh HD (by using the handle) with Disk Utility will downsize partition 2 and move partition 3 to the new end of partition 2.\nSince adding a new partition with the +-button doesn't work properly for you, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the handle and resize Macintosh HD. This should create unallocated free space\n\n*or use the +-button and create a new volume.

Regardless what I did, I had no problem to boot from either Windows 8.1 or OS X. Windows 8.1 seems to be booted in EFI-mode though.\nSince you have an older Mac, Windows will probably be booted in hybrid MBR-mode.

Re-install macOS also may help.\nSee: Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?\n", "Q: how to play RTSP video in OSX Hi is there anyway to play RTSP on OSX El Capitan ?\nthe link in windows play fine in Windows Media Player & Real Player.\non OSX , I tried VLC , Quicktime , MplayerX and I can't get it to work\nI tried playing with settings in VLC to make it work but it didn't \nplease help it's really anonying to have to go to windows everytime just to play the the RTSP link\n\nA: VLC works for me but it only supports a single video stream. QuickTime Player 10 does not support even a single RTSP stream as far as I can tell. QuickTime Player 7 worked for me up until a few days ago when I upgraded my system. I resorted to making a copy of VLC:\ncd /Applications\ncp -pr VLC.app/ VLC2.app\n\nThen opening the VLC2 app and using it to open another RTSP stream.\n\nA: Attempting to play the stream in VLC and looking at the messages window (command-shift-m) should give you a clearer idea as to what the issue could be.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Device name on router is different than OS X hostname There are tons of questions about changing a Mac hostname, and while I went through most of them, I could never find this nuanced answer:\nWhy do routers always seems to receive the first hostname that was ever set to a machine? Let me show you with these screenshots how this Mac is supposedly correctly setup according to various answers on this site:\n\n\nNow, when i set up this computer years ago, I think I chose the hostname david-MBP, and this seems to be what various routers get to this day and sometimes return to the Mac for localhost operations. Later I changed it with the various Terminal commands, and the Mac knows it, but it seems to stick around when communicating with routers. \n\nSo now my question is where do OS X keep this old value? Because since I connected with this router in the screenshot above, I never had that hostname, so it's no DHCP cache or anything like that.\n\nA: The routers will usually acquire the name of the computer when the IP address has been assigned, which is before any sharing or broadcasts are done. The computer name is/can be defined in Network Preferences under DHCP Client ID and is independent from any other computer setting. Essentially it means \"when asking for an IP address, identify yourself as /this/\". Check if you have it set like this:\n\n\nA: There are three different hostnames that macOS/OS X uses:\n\n\n*\n\n*ComputerName\n\n*HostName\n\n*LocalHostName\n\n\nEach of these values can be found in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n\nComputerName\nscutil --get ComputerName\n\nThis is Apple \"friendly\" name for the computer and can be found in System Preferences >> Sharing >> Computer Name.  According to the man page for scutil, it is described as \"The user-friendly name for the system.\"\nAccording to Apple, the ComputerName is The AppleTalk name and the default name used for SLP/DA1.  It's a zero-configuraiton protocol that allows you to set up a simple network without a DNS/DHCP server but allow you to reach the different resources via a host name.\nHostName\nscutil --get HostName\n\nAccording to the scutil man page, the HostName is \"the name associated with hostname(1) and gethostname(3)\". This name can come from any of the following sources:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The name provided by the DHCP or BootP server for the primary IP address\n\n*The first name returned by a reverse DNS (address-to-name) query for the primary IP address\n\n*The local hostname\n\n*The name “localhost”\n\n\n(In my virgin install of El Capitan, the HostName defaulted to LocalHostName)\nLocalHostName\nscutil --get LocalHostName\n\nThis is for Bonjour2 services on the LAN.  This is how, on a small LAN without DNS/DHCP, Apple computers can discover and interact with resources such as file sharing on other machines, printers, etc.  This name gets set when you initially configure your Mac.\nTL;DR\nIt is using \"the first name you ever set\" because during initial setup, it set the LocalHostName which it assumed would forever be.  When you re-configured using the GUI, you changed the ComputerName which did not modify the LocalHostName.\nIf you wish to fix this in your router, simply set your LocalHostName using the command:\nscutil --set LocalHostName MyNewComputerName.domain\n\n\n1 SLP/DA Service Location Protocol/Directory Agent. The Service Location Protocol is a service discovery protocol that allows computers and other devices to find services in a local area network without prior configuration.\n\n2 Bonjour is Apple's implementation of zero-configuration networking, a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution.\n\nA: For those who still got this issue after several years: Ask your IT to clear the DNS reverse lookup zones for your IP. Or if they have the WINS server, clear the Netbios name linked to your IP.\n\nA: I was able to find out the issue.\nYour router is keeping the device name stored. To fix it do this:\n\n*\n\n*Log into your router admin interface\n\n*Click \"Attached Devices\" (or the corresponding screen in your router that tracks the devices currently connected to it.)\n\n*There you will see the device name you want to update\n\n*Now go to the \"access control list\" screen on your router (this screen allows you to black/white list which devices are allowed to connect)\n\n*Activate the access control feature and then edit the entry that shows the device name you want to update\n\n*Simply delete the device name and click update\n\n\n*Go back to the \"attached devices\" screen (or the corresponding on your router) and you will now see that it has updated to display your current macbook device name (As your original post explained, you change the device name: \"system preferences\" -> \"sharing\".)\n\n*This fixed the issue for me. Hope that helps.\n\n\nA: I followed the instructions that Allan posted but like Giant Smptu, had to update my router.  I have a Deco Mesh wifi network.  I needed to delete my computer out of the router settings and let it connect again, but it wouldn't let me do this on my Deco Mesh setup unless I was offline.  So the steps for me were to:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off wifi on my Macbook.\n\n*Log into the Deco app on my phone.\n\n*Swipe down to refresh the list of devices and...wait.\n\n*See that my computer name vanished.\n\n*Go into offline devices\n\n\n\n\n*Tap on my old computer name, click the gear icon.\n\n\nand then ellipses and choose delete.\n\n\n\n*Turn your computer's wifi back on and it should connect w/ the new name in the router.\n\n", "Q: iMovie question (possibly need a different apple product? IDK) Okay, this question is a bit of a doozy. \nI decided to try my hand at making a rotoscoping animation. That's basically an animation created using real film as a base.  \nThe original video is 16500 frames long, 24 frames per second. I'm only animating half of those frames. \nI used \"FireAlpaca\" to draw each and every one of the still images that would be used in this video. \nDo i use imovie to make this video? Obviously since there's less frames, it's going to by quicker, correct ? How do I make it so that there are only 12 frames per second instead of 24, and therefore be able to make my video at the same length as the original film I'm using as the basis for this animation?\nEssentially it's just an extremely fast slideshow. Can I do this in imovie? Final Cut Pro? What do I do????\n\nA: See How can I combine 30,000 images into a timelapse movie?\nffmpeg\nIn answers to this question the community suggest using the open source tools Avidemux or ffmpeg. For example the ffmpeg approach is:\n\nThis will create a video slideshow (using video codec libx264) from series of png images, named named img001.png, img002.png, img003.png, …\nEach image will have a duration of 5 seconds, change the variable according to your choice.\nffmpeg -f image2 -r 1/5 -i img%03d.png -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4\n\nIf your images have four digits, use %04d, etc. If your images do not have this pattern, you can use shell globs, at least on Linux and OS X:\nffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i 'time-lapse-files/*.JPG' …\n\nYou can also change the output framerate by specifying another -r after the input.\n\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*ffmpeg: create a video from images\n\n*http://electron.mit.edu/~gsteele/ffmpeg/ for a researchers use of ffmpeg to combine individual images into a movie.\n\n\nHomebrew\nYou can use Homebrew to get ffmpeg onto your Mac:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThen install ffmpeg with:\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\n", "Q: How do i import photos from a Lumia phone to El Capitan's Photos app?

There must be some way to use the apple watch with Android, or Windows)\n\nA: There is no way to use the Apple Watch without having an Apple iPhone (and an iPhone 5 or later for that matter). It can't even be set up without first being paired to an iPhone. Windows 10 won't work either (the Apple Watch isn't even compatible with OS X on the Mac).

The Notes app occasionally shows on my lock screen. I understand that apps can show on this screen based on my location (ex: my AT&T app shows when I'm near an AT&T store) but I don't know why Notes would do this -- so far, once in my office and a couple of times in my bedroom at home. Any ideas?\nIt began happening after my upgrade to 9.0.2 though not sure if this specific version is to blame.\nUpdate: I've now had this happen multiple times in airplane mode so I suspect this behavior may have nothing to do with my location.\n\nA: Handoff is why the notes app shows up on my lock screen.\nYou could try disabling that entirely or be sure that no other device is communicating with your device over bluetooth or WiFi.\nIf you look at the text in the handoff settings, suggested apps can also be shown based on usage patterns. If you open notes every night at 7 pm, eventually the OS will suggest notes at that time based on inference. Since this intelligence was introduced with iOS nine, it would take a while for the OS to learn your habits so having it appear coincidental  with the 9.0.2 update seems plausible. \n", "Q: How do I launch a process with different date/time settings than the rest of the system? I'm developing a desktop app for OS X with behaviour that depends on the date. I want to test the behaviour without waiting for a specific date.\nI'd rather not change the date settings of the whole system as I'm worried it might mess with build systems etc. Using a VM is possible, but takes a while to set up.\nIs there a simple way to run a process and its children in a time delta relative to the actual time, without affecting the rest of the system?\n\nA: No. The system doesn't bifurcate time.\nYou would need the app in question to handle the time shift or run independently of the system time or package the app to run in a VM or other container like docker. In some limited cases, the time zone variable might help you make a little tweak, but arbitrarily setting a totally unrelated time isn't implemented on OS X.\n", "Q: GPU Panic: OS X 10.11, El Capitan stability issues and spontaneous restarts I am facing severe stability issues after doing a clean install of OS X 10.11, El Capitan, on my MacBook Pro (Mid 2010).\nIt restarts spontaneously for no apparent reason.

are seeing. If you go to an Apple Store, if your model is one of the affected ones, they have a special diagnostic to test specifically for the issue.\nThat being said, since it's about 5 years old now, it might be vintage and no longer qualify for a quality program or any repair for that matter. But at least you'll know if your problem is hardware or software. (Apple doesn't charge for the appointment or running a diagnostic)\n\nA: I went to the Genius Bar after the same kernel panics (posted above) and spontaneous crash/restarts (after the 10.11 upgrade). I knew the mid-2010 MacBook Pro had a graphics chip problem before I went, however it was never a problem. They did the diagnostic and (sure enough) Apple Techs said I needed a new logic board (where the graphics chip mounts). I said that it only became a problem with the El Capitan upgrade. Circular logic prevailed in our discussion - a sort of chicken and egg philosophical debate.\nThe tech (who shall remain unnamed) said \"Look, just downgrade your OS to the previous version and it will be fine.\" So, I did. And, it's now working fine (no more crashes) with the older, but more reliable, OS 10.6.8\nThis was a really lousy Mac experience. However, the fix was as easy as a few drag and drops to a spare drive and a Time Machine session.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and uncheck Automatic graphics switching. It resolved my problem on El Capitan.\nThis issue is caused when your Mac is transitioning from the integrated GPU to the second, discrete GPU.\nI have the same Mac configuration, and it restarts when I open high-resolution apps like Photos, HD videos on YouTube, and sometimes Launchpad.\nI also recommend you download gfxCardStatus to see when your apps are switching GPUs (should you choose not to disable automatic graphics switching).\n\nA: I have the exact same configuration - and the same GPU panic - the only difference being the addresses.  My 8-Gig of RAM is from Crucial and has worked flawlessly for 3 years.  I have been troubleshooting for several weeks and I can almost \"cause\" the panic to occur.  Note:  I get the same panic whether upgrading to El Capitan - or after a clean install.  Multiple SMC / NVRAM resets have made no difference.  I can't say yet whether unchecking the automatic graphics switching option makes any difference.  It is also the same whether running on battery or AC power.  Here are my observations so far.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the GPU panic occurs - the Mac Mail app is open with mail and side bar fully displayed or partially obscured behind another window.  Safari has typically been open as well.\n\n*The GPU panic occurs shortly after wake from sleep when the trackpad or mouse is used to scroll through mail messages.\n\n*I made it 13 days without the panic (but I also never opened the mail app during that time - since this is not my primary Mac - I was able to avoid using Mail).  Safari was open during this entire time.  All other activities were my typical daily activities.  As soon as I opened Mail - and allowed the Mac to go to sleep - within 10 seconds of waking from sleep and scrolling the list of emails - the panic occurs.\n\n*It seems that the Mac also has to be sleeping for a certain period of time before the panic will occur.  It is not necessarily possible to cause the panic to occur by intentionally telling the Mac to sleep - and then waking it shortly after.  If left in sleep for 20 minutes or longer - the panic is more likely to occur.\n\n*I will continue to troubleshoot - with \"only\" the mail app open - and also with sleep set to \"never\".\n\n\nA: I am getting similar problems on a mid-2012 retina mbpro with el capitan. \nIt only started happening yesterday but many times since. \nWhenever it has occurred, the computer has been running seriously hot. I am not using smcFanControl at high intensity and monitoring the temperatures with Temperature Gauge to see if it happens at low temperatures as well. But it may be a problem that's provoked by intense GPU usage. \nAnother clue mentioned here is that (apart from hardware problems) it might have to do with which kernel extensions are loaded: https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7592234\nHere is my kernel panic log: http://pastebin.com/hci9xBKW\nEdit: perhaps using really GPU intensive things like going back and forth in youtube videos can stress it and potentially provoke it for testing purposes...\n\nA: I hope that someone gives you a precise answer like update your duet software or unplug this specific piece of hardware, but you may have to do the manual troubleshooting labor and record each instance of the panic in order to narrow down what's causing it.\nThat process is extremely easy but a little time-consuming:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your data is backed up  at intervals that makes sense for you. \n\n*How serious are occasional kernel panics?\nYou can then ignore occasional kernel panics and be meticulous about troubleshooting ones that are repeatable. Keep in mind, how repeatable a panic is can be hard to estimate until you have 10 or more instances and can look back over specific logs and circumstances. These logs also make it far easier to decide whether to repair hardware or focus on software repair and configuration. \n\nA: I have the same MBPconfiguration and have been having the same GPU crashes but far more frequently - every 10 minutes in xcode.  I did download the gfxcardstatus tool and set it to internal display only and have now been running for about 45 minutes with no crashes ... so this may not be a complete test but it does seem better. FWIW ... \n\nA: Have a 2010 MacBook Pro. Upgrade to Yosemite. It slowed down so I upgraded to El Capitan. It got worse. Took it in for diagnostics and it failed on video main logic card..? \nThey took it for about a week to fix it. I am really nervous about them messing it up even more. It will cost $310.00. It was working fine before the upgrade. I had to upgrade because they said it was not compatible with my I-phone 5S.\nSo long story short, this appears to be something that can be fixed for a flat rate repair. Less than $350 for parts, labor and shipping. Really disappointed with Mac as I hoped to not need to pay for a repair so soon.\n", "Q: Can't write on external HDD after upgrading to OS X El Capitan I am using a LaCie external hard disk in my MacBookPro for 3 years. After having updated to OS X El Capitan, I am no longer able to write on the HDD and I have read-only privileges. Info shows that the HDD is formatted in NTFS but, before upgrading, I was able to both read and write on the hard disk without any problem and without any external app.\nAny suggestions to solve this issue?\n[Update]: I have installed Tuxera NTFS and now everything works fine. Before I had other applications that are no longer valid for El Capitan.\n\nA: You have to install Tuxera NTFS or Paragon NTFS, OS X is not able to write on NTFS.\nhttp://www.tuxera.com\nhttps://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/\nEdit :\nA free solution : http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntfsfree/\n\nA: This link worked for me http://www.seagate.com/gb/en/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/ but I have a seagate drive, might work with others.\n\nA: If you have Seagate drives you can download a free driver from here: Paragon Driver for Mac OS\n\nA: I think the issue may have to do with USB power.  My portable drive without an external power source can not mount (though it shows in system report and the light flashes).  A drive with external power and the same formatting mounts without issue.\n", "Q: iCloud photo question I have iCloud Photo Library turned on for all my devices (iPhone, iPad, IPod).\nMy question: Is there any way to have iCloud turned on but have photos save to just one device with out having them saved to all devices? \nIf I try to delete the picture or video it deletes from all 3 devices, is there a way to have iCloud Photo Library turned on but still be able to just have pictures on one device? \nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Yes. You can do this by heading to Settings > iCloud then turn off the Photos option. This will disable photo sharing between devices, allowing you to delete your photos off of one device but keep them on the others, or vice versa. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Text Messaging Dots If I sent 2 text messages to 2 different people within a few minutes of each other and returned to one of those conversations and saw the dot bubbles like I was getting a response, and then received an actual response to the other message (the one I wasn't looking at), would that mean that the dot bubbles were for the other conversation and not the one I was looking at when I saw them?\n\nA: No, the typing indicator is specific to the person that is typing the message. The typing indicator will be shown in the conversation that it is relevant to.\n", "Q: When migrating from iPhoto to Photos my trainer deleted Photos library rather than iPhotos library OS X Yosemite v. 10.10.5... When migrating from iPhoto to Photos my trainer deleted Photos library rather than iPhotos library. What needs to be done to correct?\n\nA: Just re-migrate. Open Photos and it will ask you if you want to migrate your iPhoto Library.\n", "Q: When can I tell Siri to 'Remind me about this'? Sometimes when I tell Siri \"Remind me about this\" or \"Remind me about this when I leave/arrive/get home/work/car\" she replies:\n\nOK, just tell me what you want to be reminded about.\n\nAnd other times, depending on the app, she adds a reminder to my reminders list. Is there any to know if telling Siri \"Remind me about this\" will result in a reminder being creating without trying it first on a specific screen?\n\nA: As far as I can tell there is no way to tell if you are using a single device. However if you have more than one device that is Handoff enabled then you can be reasonably certain that if a screen within an app makes Handoff visible to another device then you can tell Siri to \"Remind me about this\" and a reminder will be created.\n", "Q: How do I get the messages view back in Mail on OS X? Normally when in the non-classic view in Mail there is list on the left for my mailbox, a list in the middle for my inbox, and a list on the right for the messages contained in a conversation. I don't see the last list on the right. Is there a way to get that pane back, perhaps through an option in the menu? I'm running the last versions of everything (10.11).\n\nA: I think you've dragged the right edge of the middle list all the way to the right, which then hides the preview of the messages. If you hover your mouse of the right edge of the scroll bar on the right you should get the draggable crosshair mouse pointer. Hold it and drag left and you should get the previews back.\n", "Q: How do I get a CD version of El Capitan suitable for a Macbook Pro? I have 2 Macs, and am downloading El Capitan from the app store.  I want to see if I can install it on an older MacBook Pro that has a broken Command-R feature that prevents me from installing the OS.  (It says contact apple support)\nSince that costs $, I'd rather see if I can simply boot and reinstall the OS in a clean way.\nHow do I locate and burn the downloaded El Capitan in a way that will make it bootable on the other mac?\n\nA: Apple does not sell an optical media version of El Capitan. You need to use OS X Recovery or a USB drive to re-install El Capitan, which is relatively simple to create. All you need is an 8 GB USB drive and a computer running OS X. Instructions on how to create such an installer are here: How to make a bootable OS X 10.11 El Capitan installer drive\n\nMaking the installer drive\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connect to your Mac a properly formatted 8GB (or larger) drive, and rename the drive Untitled. (The Terminal commands I provide here\n  assume that the drive is named Untitled. If the drive isn’t named\n  Untitled, the procedure won’t work.)\n  \n*Make sure the El Capitan installer (or at least a copy of it), called Install OS X El Capitan.app, is in its default location in your\n  main Applications folder (/Applications).\n  \n*Select the text of the following Terminal command and copy it.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume\n\n/Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\\n  Capitan.app --nointeraction\n  \n*Launch Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities).\n  \n*Warning: This step will erase the destination drive or partition, so make sure that it doesn’t contain any valuable data. Paste the\n  copied command into Terminal and press Return.\n  \n*Type your admin-level account password when prompted, and then press Return.\n  \n*You may see the message “To continue we need to erase the disk at /Volumes/Untitled. If you wish to continue type (Y) then press\n  return:” If so, type the letter Y and then press Return. If you don't\n  see this message, you're already set.\nThe Terminal window displays createinstallmedia’s progress as a\n  textual representation of a progress bar: Erasing Disk: 0%... 10\n  percent...20 percent... and so on. You also see a list of the\n  program’s tasks as they occur: Copying installer files to disk... Copy\n  complete. Making disk bootable... Copying boot files... Copy complete.\n  The procedure can take as little as a couple minutes, or as long as 20\n  to 30 minutes, depending on how fast your Mac can copy data to the\n  destination drive. Once you see Copy Complete. Done., as shown in the\n  screenshot above, the process has finished.\nCreateinstallmedia will have renamed your drive from Untitled to\n  Install OS X El Capitan. You can rename the drive (in the Finder) if\n  you like—renaming it won’t prevent it from working properly.\n\n", "Q: Is there a Non-Retina Macbook Pro 2015? I want to buy a new MacBook Pro and I'm wondering if there's a non-retina MacBook Pro 2015.\nI'm asking this because on the compare Mac models page (http://www.apple.com/mac/compare/), there's a Non-Retina MacBook Pro, is it 2015 or all 2015 are always retina?\n\nA: No, the non-Retina models are 2012.\n\nA: Yes there is, the non retina has been sold till 2016 and the options included various choices like an ssd that the early configurations didn't have\n", "Q: Using Tag how do I cut and parse file paths into tags I'm using Tag and Hazel and I'd like to recursively go through files on our server, obtain their file paths and filenames and parse the whole thing into tags to apply to the file.  Is there a shell script that can do this?  I can use Leap by Ironic Software to remove the trash tags system wide, but this gives me a real start into an automatic tagging system for all my files.\nBasically I'm going to take a filename like \n\n/Volumes/media/Clientele/Stock/Purchased Sets/Vintage\n  Bundle/vintage-bundle-7/offset/30_CIRCULAR_VECTOR_TEXTURES/C03.eps\n\nTruncate the /Volumes/media/Clientele/Stock/ off the top, and the file extension .eps from the end, then cut the rest into separate tags:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased Sets\n\n*Vintage Bundle \n\n*vintage \n\n*bundle \n\n*7 \n\n*offset \n\n*30 \n\n*CIRCULAR\n\n*VECTOR \n\n*TEXTURES\n\n*C03\n\n\n...remove leading and trailing spaces, change to lowercase, then reapply those tags back to the file with tag.  \nAdditionally, removing tags from the system that are just numbers would be helpful also.\nUpdate: I need to do this specifically:\nHazel handles the recursion so for every file it finds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Store the $working_folder and the $filepath\n\n*cut the $working_folder from the $filepath\n\n*cut the $result at the _-. <space> , characters and store into a list or array\n\n*loop through the list or array and sed 's/^[ \\t]*//;s/[ \\t]*$//' to remove leading and trailing whitespace (from http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt)\n\n*convert the array to a comma separated string to feed into tag -s $comma_separated_tags $filepath\nI just don't know how to put that into a bash script format.\n\nA: run 'find' from a root directory searching for plain files (-type f?) and -exec a bash script on each file (or perhaps automator).\nLooks like you'll need a bit of 'basename' and 'sed'.\nAppend to an empty string for each input path, and treat that as a list\nfor that file. I believe with 'tag' that you can pass a comma separated list, so you can append one (dealing with first having no comma) or post process using 'sed'. worst case loop over the list string and run 'tag'\neach time.\n'tag' might be smart enough to append tags it doesn't already have what's passed, otherwise the top of the script might want to bail if the file already contains tags.\nNot trivial to write, but if you're not familiar with bash, tag and sed it\nwould be a good learning exercise.\n", "Q: How do I ONLY receive and send iMessage (not SMS)? Is this possible? I have an international phone plan that charges way too much money for international texts. I'd like to still be able to use iMessage instead of other texting apps, (but realize it will only be able to be with folks who have an iPhone and iMessage activated.) \nI believe I've figured out my settings so I only send iMessage, but I can not figure out how to FORCE receiving texts only through iMessage and not SMS.\nIs this possible? \n\nA: Might this have changed recently?\nIt appears now one can select to \"send as SMS\" when iMessage is unavailable (Settings > Messages on iPhone).  Perhaps now there is also a way to only have texts sent as iMessages only when being sent internationally, yet also have domestic (within country) texts sent as either iMessage and/or SMS?\n\nA: It's not possible to force receiving to sms or iMessage... The sender determines how the message will be sent (sms or iMessage), the receiver can't pick how the message is arriving. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro will not shut all the way off When I tried to shut off my MacBookPro, the Apple Insignia, on the outside case, is still illuminated, and the screen is black, but I have the outline of the mouse pointer.  It will not turn back on.  None of the keyboard keys do anything.  It seems to be locked up.  Has anybody experienced this issue, and have a solution to fix?\n\nA: If you tire of waiting, press and hold the power button.\nIf you want to run a disk check, reboot to recovery and use Disk Utility. Usually, it's just a stuck process and you won't need to fix things. Test a power off to see if the hang was incidental or if it happens 3 out of 3 attempts.\n", "Q: Boot Camp failed and reduced Macintosh HD partition from 3TB to 1,46TB What went wrong?

Whether Windows was installed or not, this should be possible.\nAlternatively, since I'm guessing you haven't repartitioned your drive since you installed El Capitan, you won't be able to resize the partition unless you use a source outside of your computer. Even in recovery mode, you won't be able to repartition. You might be able to resize it in Disk Utility if you use Internet Recovery: CMD + Option + R at boot. Another option would be to boot into recovery mode, install OS X on a USB drive, then from the installation on that USB drive, you would for sure be able to resize your partition.\nI have done this many times, so I understand the frustration it can cause when you have space that you can't recover and the only way to get it back involves several hours of your time.\nThe good news is that if you ever start with a fresh partition in El Capitan, their new partition scheme is resizable even when you're using it live so you wouldn't need to ever even touch Recovery Mode.\n\nA: Make a new BootCamp partition, minimum size. It will \"eat\" all the free space that MacOS can't see. Then you'll be able to restore the entire space again via BootCamp Assistant.\n", "Q: Connecting an old Mac to home entertainment system I have an old MacBook Pro, with DVI-out video, analog audio (earphone and speaker ports), and of course USB. I'm using it to manage my iTunes library, but the only way to play iTunes content on my home entertainment system is via Wi-Fi to an Apple TV box.\nMy question: Is there a viable way to connect the Mac to an open HDMI port on my home system? I know that DVI-to-HDMI is video only, so I'd have to find out how to add the audio -- which is the whole point of the exercise! (Is there any such thing as an analog-to-HDMI or USB-to-HDMI audio adapter?)\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes.  It's very easy.  You need to get a \"DVI to HDMI with audio\" adapter.  The way it works is that it takes the two separate signals, digital video and audio, and combines them on the HDMI signal which supports the audio.\nHere's one from Startech that worked really well for me.\n\n\nIf you notice, the DVI and RCA Audio is on the Input side and the HDMI is on the Output side.  These are not bidirectional; meaning it will not work in reverse.  So, it will take a DVI and audio and convert to HDMI.  It won't \"break out\" HDMI to DVI and audio.\n", "Q: Upgrade iPad to newer (but not latest) iOS How do I upgrade my iPad 3 from iOS 5.1 to 7.x (now when the latest version is >8)?\n\nA: *\n\n*First backup your iPad in case something goes wrong (if you have jailbroken your device I advice you to save your shsh blobs, it's not necessary).\n\n*Next download the os version you want to upgrade to from https://ipsw.me/ \n\n*Finally open iTunes, cancel if asked for an update. Go to your iPad's summary page. Hold alt/option key (OS X), or Shift key (Windows) and click on restore. A window will show up choose the ipsw your downloaded before and and your upgrade will start. Then afterwards reinstall the backup. \n\n", "Q: How do I mirror my iPhone screen to my MacBook Pro for free? I am using a 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro with Yosemite and an iPhone 4s with iOS 9.\nI want to record game tutorials. \nI've tried to use the QuickTime Player to screen record but the little arrow on the right side of the record button doesn't show my iPhone video, only the microphone. \nIs there any good, free way to do it? \n\nA: QuickTime Player can only mirror iOS devices with Lightning connectors.  If you want to mirror an iPhone 4s, you'll need to purchase one of the AirPlay Mirroring apps like AirServer.\nAccording to this support article (emphasis added):\n\nMovie recording works with your built-in camera and many external cameras. If you're using OS X Yosemite or later, you can also record the screen of any iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) with a Lightning port and iOS 8 or later.\n\n", "Q: After uninstalling iBooks, I can't sign in to iTunes any more I am currently using El Capitan.\nEvery time I uninstalled iBooks so I could manage my books with iTunes, I found I simply couldn't sign in to iTunes any more. That means I click the 'sign in' button but no sign-in window pops up. I can't purchase or re-download any of my music or books. \nAnd reinstalling iBooks fixes it all.\nIs there a way I can manage my books with iTunes and can still sign into my account?\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstall iTunes 12.3.x \n\n*then install iTunes 12.2.x. \n\n\nSeems as if 12.3 must have iBooks not so with 12.2.2.\n", "Q: Can I downgrade my Ipod4 running IOS 6.1.6 to IOS 5.1.1 then upgrade to 6.0? So I've been wanting to jailbreak for about a good 3 years now (Yes, I am a failure) and have found it near impossible to jailbreak ios 6.1.6 .\nNow, I have an iPod4 with ios 5.1.1 (but it is my sisters) and I will be able to create the shsh blobs.  \nSo after admitted defeat of trying to jailbreak ios 6.1.6, I thought of downgrading to ios 5.1.1 and jailbreaking. But this is not a great idea as most of my apps run on IOS 6.\nTo make a long stoy short, how do I downgrade to ios 5.1.1 then upgrade to 6.0 but not 6.1.6?\nThank you for your time and consideration. \nBTW: I don't have SHSH blobs for IOS 6.0\nBTW: If you could include a way to get the SHSH blobs off the Ipod4 it would be helpful.\n\nA: You can't. Restoring a device to any version of iOS, be it an upgrade, downgrade, or same-version restoration, requires Apple to still be signing it. In some cases, a utility such as TinyUmbrella can trick iTunes into installing an unsigned version, but not only do you need the SHSH blobs to do that (which you don't), no one has figured out a way to get that to work since iOS 5.\nSo, in short: if you had saved the SHSH blobs when your iPod was running iOS 5, then you could probably downgrade to iOS 5, but installing any version of iOS 6 besides 6.1.6 is impossible at this time.\n", "Q: Getting error message, \"You must install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime?\" I'm getting the following error when trying to launch my application after upgrading Mac OSX:  \n\nThe more info says to go here and download this file.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Click \"More Info…\"\n\n*This will take you to this page.\n\n*Click \"Download.\"\n\n*When it finishes downloading, run the installer.\n\n\ntl;dr — literally just follow Apple's instructions and you should be set.\n", "Q: iCloud Catch 22 - Cannot sign out of old dead Apple ID on iPads I have two iPads, both upgraded to IOS 9.02. I can't use iCloud on either pad because I can't change the iCloud Apple ID. Here's why:\nI changed the Email address of my Apple ID primary account since the old one was at my previous employer and is no longer accessible. I made this change at Apple.com.\nOn both pads, I had no problem changing the App and iTunes store apple ID. I can download Apps and make purchases on both pads.\nWhen I try to change Settings|iCloud it asks me to \n\nSign in to iCloud for\n    Apple ID \"oldemail@oldcompany.com\".\n\nAttempting to sign out brings up: \n\nEnter the Apple ID for the \"oldemail@oldcompany.com\" \n  to turn off Find My iPad.\n\nNo password is acceptable here. I cannot change the Apple ID back to  since I cannot verify the email and the change doesn't take effect until verification has been completed.  I have tried changing back to the old ID get a \n\nAccount is Locked\n\nmessage on the iPad when I try to use it - probably because of the unverified address.\nCatch-22.\nThis appears to be the same unresolved issue from last year.\nAs well as this one.\nApple's 'community' has been less than helpful, filled with people saying\nto go to the useless Apple iForgot and other such nonsense. It would appear that others just got sick of the whole thing and quit trying.\n\nA: Prior to the upgrade to iOS 9.02 this was unresolvable without going to an Apple Store with proof of purchase.  With 9.02 it you can work around it.\nThe steps I used were: \n\n\n*\n\n*At the Apple ID site, change the Apple ID email to \"oldemail@oldcompany.com\" -- this will never be verified.\n\n*On the iPad go to Settings|iCloud - It will ask for the password.\n\n*I logged on with the correct password - it now greys out the entire iCloud area and puts a Validate Email message at the top of the form, BUT does not grey out the Sign out.\n\n*I Signed out and it asked for the password twice again, paused for a long time and then was asking for a new iCloud Apple ID.\n\n*Back at the Apple ID site, change the Apple ID back to the valid account.\n\n*From the mail client, validate the Account with the correct password.\n\n*On the iPad, Settings|iCloud enter the new Apple ID and password.\n\n\nPoof - problem solved\n", "Q: Apple Mail App :: \"Erase Junk Mail\" is greyed out I'm running OS X El Capitan, and have 3 Gmail accounts signed into it.

How can I use this option?\n\n\nA: Go to mail>preferences>junk mail>under when junk mail arrives make sure options #2 move it to the Junk mailbox is selected and this should fix your problem immediately. \nLet me know if you need any help, this is what worked for me after I let my junk mail build up to over 600, which was killing me, I can understand you want it gone! Should look like this:\n\n\nA: It looks like this option is disabled when Apple Mail is set to its default Junk settings.\nOne of the option groups in the settings panel for Junk is When junk mail arrives. By default it is set to Mark as junk mail, but leave in my inbox. \nChanging this to Move it to the Junk mailbox activates the menu item you refer to.\n\nA: This is a sign that Apple Mail's built-in junk mail filtering is turned off. Go into Preferences and select the Junk Mail tab in order to turn it back on again.\n", "Q: Two Calendar alerts not working since iOS 9 update Since the iOS 9.0.x update, I can't set two different alerts on calendar entries. \nWhatever I put in for the first or second alert overwrites both time periods. \nIs there a fix or workaround for this?\n\nA: I was able to duplicate this issue on iOS 9.0.2, and these steps worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap \"Second Alert\"\n\n*Set it to \"None\" (at the top)\n\n*Tap \"Second Alert\" again\n\n*Set it to the desired time.\n\n\nA: This appears to be fixed on iOS 9.1 for me. Do a backup just in case your upgrade goes south, but my upgrades were all 15 minutes of waiting during reboots once the download was done.\n", "Q: How do I remove or disable the Photos app in El Capitan? When I try to drag Photos.app or certain other bundled system apps to the trash in El Capitan, I get the error\n\n“Photos.app” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by OS X.\n\nThe solution in Yosemite would be simply to use\n$ sudo rm -Rf Photos.app\n\nbut this method is blocked in El Capitan.  You instead get\n\nOperation not permitted\n\nI tried to change permissions with\n$ chflags -R nouchg Photos.app\n\nto no avail.\nThere must be a way around this!\n\nA: UPDATE: I have unselected my answer because an icon-less and half-working (see screenshot) version of Photos.app appeared on my system and opened automatically on SD-card insert.  This worked and did not cause problems for months, and now Photos is back \nEl Capitan has a new feature called System Integrity Protection. It does not allow the deletion of preinstalled apps.  This link gives details for disabling it.  The short of it is:\nRestart and hold Command+R to go into recovery mode.  Open \"Terminal\", found in the \"Utilities menu\" and use the commands\n$ csrutil disable; reboot\n\nto disable SIP and reboot.  Now open Terminal.app normally and do\n$ cd /Applications/\n$ sudo rm -Rf Photos.app\n\nand live happily ever after.\nA few caveats: I don't know what SIP does specifically, but this post suggests you should at least re-enable it right away (and perhaps not disable it at all, ever).  Go ahead and do that by using the command \n$ csrutil enable; reboot\n\nin Recovery mode (see above).  I also don't know whether El Capitan has Photos.app-dependent system processes or not, so your mac may potentially not work the way you want it after this.  I have protected myself by first Archiving Photos.app and leaving Photos.app.zip in /Applications/, but again, I don't even know if this is good enough.  So proceed at your own peril!\nFinally, this will work to get rid of any bundled system app (but the same or more severe warnings apply).\n\nA: Rather than removing the app, what I did was the following...\nI disabled SIP (like Alejandro posted).  Then I went into the applications folder, \"Get Info\" for the Photos app, then set the \"Everyone\" permissions to \"No Access\".  This way, when anything is plugged in, the app will not launch (well it starts then stops) but the app remains in case you need to reenable it.  Once that is done, reenable SIP.\n\nA: Right click on \"Photos\" in \"Applications\" folder. Click \"get Info\". Change all permissions to \"read and write\". Drag Photos app to Trash.\nThis works for any stock apps by Mac OS.\n", "Q: ExtremeCap U3, RECentral, and El Capitan I recently upgraded to El Capitan and RECentral, the streaming application I use to play my Wii U on my iMac, no longer starts up reliably.

I'm learning how to code in Python using TextWrangler as my text editor (using OS X), and I've been unable to open any files. Here's how I want to open the files:\nfile = open(\"genomic_dna.txt\")\n\nWhenever I try to run this, I get an error message saying it can't locate the file. Or any other file I've tried. I've also tried specifying the file path with the same result. Here's the error message I get every time:\n\n~/Desktop/exercises/chapter_2/calculating_at_content.py:1: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'genomic_dna.txt'\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I think @timothymh is right, this is a Python question not a Textwrangler one, but regardless, to open a file with Textwrangler:\nvia the Finder\nJust double click it. If that file type is associated with a different application then open the context menu for the file, and select \"Get Info\" and change the \"Open with:\" to Textwrangler. Click the \"Change All…\" if you want all files of that type to open in Textwrangler.\nvia the Terminal\nWith Textwrangler open and active, select the Textwrangler menu and \"Install Command Line Tools\". This will give you the edit command, so to open a text file in Documents called \"My Text File.txt\" you'd issue the command via the terminal of:\nedit ~/Documents/My\\ Text\\ File.txt\n\nand it will open in Textwrangler.\nNow that's out the way…\nThe Python problem\nYou're trying to open a file without giving the full path to the file. Since you don't give a full path (either absolute or relative) the command assumes it's a relative file path, which means it will look for \"genomic_dna.txt\" in the current working directory.\nYou've also not specified a file mode, which means open will assume you want to read the file. All of which means you get an error, because that file does not exist in the current working directory.\nTo fix this, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give an absolute path, e.g. file = open(\"/Users/jonathan/Documents/genomic_dna.txt\") (or wherever genomic_dna.txt is to be found, obviously).\n\n*Give a relative path, e.g. if the current working directory is ~/PythonProjects/ then file = open(\"../Documents/genomic_dna.txt\").\n\n*If the file doesn't exist because you haven't created it yet and want to write to it, then pass the file mode, e.g. file = open(\"genomic_dna.txt\", \"w\").\n\n\nYou might want to try using the Python interpreter to test your code out first and then transfer it to a file (by using Textwrangler to save it). To open the interpreter just type python at a terminal and press enter.\n", "Q: OmniFocus adds note when capturing reminder I have OmniFocus set up to capture reminders created in Reminders.app on my iPhone 6 running iOS 9.

This way, any reminders with extra information unavailable to OmniFocus are still accessible.\nA reminder captured under this scheme will have a special blurb of text appended to its note:\n\"Original task available in the 'Captured by OmniFocus' list in Reminders.\"\n\nFrom the OmniFocus forums\n\nIs there any way to turn off or rename \"Captured by OmniFocus\" to avoid this confusion?\nIf you'd rather not deal with the Captured by OmniFocus list at all, and you're sure you won't use the deep links functionality in reminders to be captured, you can revert to the old behavior of deleting captured reminders with a preference URL:\nomnifocus:///change-preference?RemindersCaptureDeletesReminders=1\nAny reminders captured after opening this URL will be deleted out of Reminders entirely, instead of being moved to Captured by OmniFocus. Once you change that setting, you can delete the Captured by OmniFocus list. (If you ever want to use the new way again, reopen the above URL, replacing the 1 with a 0; OmniFocus will recreate the Captured list as necessary.)\n\n", "Q: Read files from old windows-formatted external USB hard drive Years ago, I used an external USB hard drive with my PC (most likely Windows XP at the time). I've been trying to recover some files off of the old drive, but I no longer have a Windows machine and the drive is not being read by my Mac. The drive powers on, but nothing happens. No icon on my desktop, no sign of the drive in Disk Utility, no sign in Finder. \nI've downloaded FUSE for OS X as well as Paragon's NTSF for Mac OS X, but still nothing. I'm not concerned with writing to the drive, but I'd like to get some old files off of there. Is there anything else that I can try?\n\nA: You need to copy those documents to a windows machine. After that you need to format a USB stick MS-DOS (FAT32). Formatting USB drive as MS-DOS (FAT32) will alow you to use the USB on Windows and OS !

I discovered /Library/Updates is taking up a lot of space.\nAfter a quick Google, I found /Library/Updates is used to store system updates file which have not been applied.\nSo is it safe to clean up /Library/Updates?\n\nA: Theoretically, there should only be updates in that folder until you actually run the updates, then they should be cleared - so my first suggestion would be to check the App Store app & run any pending updates from there, reboot, then recheck the folder.\nAnything left over at that point ought to be safe to delete, though I would retain the index.plist PPDVersions.plist & ProductMetadata.plist files, if present, unless you are having general updating issues, as I suspect they are designed to accurately track the update state.\n", "Q: How can I rename Desktops / Spaces in macOS? I would like to give names to different Mission Control Spaces; currently a new Space gets the default name Desktop n where n is a number.\n\n\nDesktop 1 | Desktop 2 | Desktop 3\n\nHow can I give each space a custom meaningful name?\n\nA: I'm currently in a position where I want to define a Desktop by a task I'm currently working on; one desktop per task. This makes solutions like using a full screen app or assigning an image unsuitable for me, since I often use more than a single app to fulfill a task and my to do list changes so often that creating custom desktop backgrounds or writing out a legend is not efficient.\nWhat I've been doing is, since I usually need several terminals at a time, I just name each one based on what I'm doing. That helps me remember what all my terminals are for, and then I can just right-click on the terminal icon to get a sort of on-the-fly legend.\n\nA: Nope, there is no way to natively do that. But you can put an application into fullscreen and the Desktop will take the application's name.\nElse way, there is some third party applications who will help you do to so (not all of them may run natively on ARM yet):\n\nSpaces Renamer\nSpaces Renamer is a combination of an application and SIMBL plugin to allow you to rename your spaces.\n\n\nTotal Spaces\nThe commercial app TotalSpaces by binaryage allows you to name Spaces.\n\n\nYou may need to partially disable SIP in order to use TotalSpaces or Spaces Renamer, see:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos\n\n*http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan\n\n*http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan-with-sip\nYou should probably read this before to disable it:\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2019/06/19/what-is-sip-and-when-is-it-safe-to-turn-it-off/\n\n\nRelated posts:\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/313387/changing-name-of-space-in-mac-os-x-lion\n\n*How can I rename desktops in Mission Control?\n\nA: I am using the built-in Stickies app. I've created a sticky for each space on the top left corner. Just set the sticky window to Floating which keeps it on top of every other window.\n\nThis way you get a nice label for each Space which is visible while you are working.\n\nTo see all your Spaces just select the Stickies app, click Control + ↓ and you see the stickies in a row which represent your Spaces and also clickable:\n\nPlus desktop can be selected from a list as asgardian07's answer shows.\n\nA: This is something that I wanted for ages, so I finally got around and built an open source solution!\nIt behaves similarly to TotalSpaces in that it uses SIMBL to hook into the display functionality, and uses an application with a top menu bar button to rename the desktops.  To install it, just head over to my GitHub and follow the installation instructions!\nScreenshots:\n\nEdited Names\n\nName-changing UI\n\nA: A very low technology but quite direct solution is to assign keystrokes to each desktop\n\n*\n\n*Preferences -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> Mission Control : has built-in options allowing you to assign ^1 to Desktop 1 and so on\n\n*Then write your desired Desktop Names on a small stickie note (a physical one!) and stick it near the number keys. All your Desktop names are constantly in view, and each is just a single keystroke away...\n\nWith this approach, you'll also want to keep your Desktops in fixed order:\n\n*\n\n*In Mission Control settings, turn off the 1st checkbox for \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use.\" (BigSur v11.1)\n\n\nA: I had a thought. Why not just put a small sticky on the monitor above the desktop space with the description of that desktop.\n\nA: Add a sticky to each desktop, with the desktop label. Then you can right-click on the app icon and switch between desktops!\n\n\nA: I have found that opening one app per desktop names it after that. In my work that's really helpful because it allows me to have google gasmask open in one, terminal running my local server in another, atom in another and so on, very helpful that it names it after the app running!\n\nA: UPDATED SOLUTION:\nI came up with a better hack inspired by Karl's answer. Open up the Stickies app. Right click on it on the Dock and select Options -> All Desktops.\nCreate one sticky. In it create a list like this:\nDesktop 1 - Email\nDesktop 2 - Gaming\nDesktop 3 - Home Business\n\nMake it tall enough and the font large enough so that it is legible when in Command Center.\nNow, when you go into Command Center, your \"legend\" will be available on all Desktops so you can quickly see which one to switch to.\nORIGINAL SOLUTION:\nHere's another hack. Open TextEdit and create a new document. Change the font size to something like 175 points and reshape the window to be very short and very wide. Type in the name you want for that desktop. Then duplicate the document, move it to a new desktop and change the name visible there.\nAs a result you can usually read the names in Mission Control (as long as a window isn't obscuring it) and you can easily switch to a Desktop by name by showing all TextEdit windows and selecting the correct one.\n\nA: [Update: creator here - I have pulled this app from the App Store because it's a free app that I currently don't have a great way to test on Monterey, as I don't own hardware that can run it (I have a 2014 MBP), and it now has not received bug updates in over a year.]\nThere's an app (in the Mac App Store) that lets you name Spaces via the menubar. It also lets you give each Space a unique icon, and tells you how you spend time across your Spaces (and the apps within them). Because macOS APIs are limited, the names stay in the app and don't show up in Mission Control. But they are persistent.\nThe app also lets you jump directly to another (named) Space via its dropdown menu. B/c Apple lets you have up to 16 Spaces per screen, this is handy in navigating between them.\nHere's a preview shot, you can see the option to jump directly to a Space (app calls them Rooms) via a dropdown, and you can see time spent across them. \nFree in the App Store -- CurrentKey Stats. I made it, and it launched about a week before this comment was made. For additional stats (30-day view and exportable reports) you can buy an upgrade, but all the above stuff is free.\n\nA: You could also make a screenshot of the application. Then set that as the desktop wallpaper for that space. \n\nA: I tried this solution and it worked perfectly with Catalina so it should work for everything before that\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/400347/359843\n\nA: There is one simple, effective solution that does not require disabling SIP or constant fiddling.\nThe Wallpaper for each Space can be set independently. Control-click on the desktop of a Space, select Change Wallpaper and choose an image relevant to the function of the space. You can also make one yourself in your favourite image editor with the name you want to give the space. Personally, I'm enjoying typing the name I want to give the space into an image synthesiser and using the AI-generated image.\n\nA: I've figured it out. All you have to do is make the app or browser page full screen, and it will automatically be named in the mission control view.

Any ideas on how to find the issue or source process?\nThanks\n\nA: To answer your question, here's an introduction to what SecTaskLoadEntitlements really is/does:\nAn application (.app) in OS X is really a folder containing a number of files, including the actual program, resources (graphics, sounds, etc) as well as system files such as plist files.\nOne of these plist files contains a descriptions of the application's entitlements. An entitlement is either that the application \"can do\" a certain thing, or that it has permission to do a certain thing.\nExamples on OS X would be for an app to have the permission to get read-only access to your Music folder, or that it is allowed to interact with Bluetooth devices, record from your microphone, etc.\nApplication on the OS X App Store are required to use entitlements in so that that they're required to be sandboxed, which is an entitlement in itself.\nIn order to make sure that entitlements cannot be changed or unrightfully gained, the entitlements are \"signed\". This means that the developer of the application uses a specific cryptographic key to \"sign\" the entitlements.\nOS X checks the signature when loading in new applications, and only if it is signed correctly will it load the entitlements and apply them to the program.\nYour error message means that the \"airportd\" program tried to load in the entitlements for an application, but it failed with error number 22. The number 22 means that an invalid argument (parameter) was given.\nAirportd manages the wireless interfaces (WiFi) on your Mac.\nSo to sum up: The source process is \"airportd\", and the issue is an invalid argument given for loading entitlements.\nHowever, this does not mean that you'll experience any user-facing errors. If you're not having any problems with the WiFi interfaces, then you can just ignore the log messages.\n\nA: There seems to be some problems with wifi drivers on El Captain. I got some huge airportd crashes with that error message. Try to update to the last version of OS X (10.11.2), it seems to be a bit better. \n", "Q: Unable to install Boot Camp 6 Update for Windows 10 due an invalid signature I previously upgraded to Windows 10 on my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)'s Windows (former W7) Partition.

It's called \"ENTIDAD PUBLICA EMPRESARIAL RED.ES\".

They say they're \"responsible for the .es TLD:\n\nDominos \".es\" is responsible for managing the Internet Domain Names Registry for the country code \".es\". The registry management tasks include processing applications and assigning new domains.\nIt is a part of the public business entity Red.es.\n\nICANN seems to agree. It looks like they sell their own SSL certificates for domains, and so they'd need a root certificate on your computer - otherwise, your browser would complain.\nIf you don't visit .es websites often, I'd be inclined to disable that certificate. It's one more company that, if infiltrated, their root certificate could* be used to impersonate any website. Like, say... this one.\n\n*I'm not entirely sure about that last one, I'm not an expert on certificate chains. It's possible that this root CA is only valid for *.es  domains.

I'm sure both can join Open Directory, or at least Linux can.\nMost importantly, how can I get Contacts/Cal to work across Android/Windows mobile and desktop devices?\nOS X 10.10 Server\n\nA: Server data app on OS X is highly standards compliant. LDAP is industry-standard (but it's not active directory),  Mail is IMAP, CardDAV, WebDAV and CalDAV. All are quite standard and ubiquitous.

I then tried to restore the partition in the recovery mode. It seemed to have gone fine but it has got stuck at the last step for ~20 hours now (please see attached image). \n\nI realize it's a foolish thing to have done this without having my data backed up! So, I'm not sure if I should try a hard reset. \n\nA: In theory, exit code 0 means \"No errors found, or successfully repaired\" - though I don't know why it has then failed to complete & light the Done button.\nExit code 8 was \"A corrupt filesystem was found during a check, or repairs did not succeed.\" which would not really be surprising if you were trying to work on the partition you were booted from.\nDisk Utility is actually running a process called fsck_hfs which has published exit codes on the OS X developer pages\nEXIT VALUES\n     fsck_hfs indicates some status by exit value.  The current list of exit status results is:\n           0       No errors found, or successfully repaired.\n           3       A quick-check (the -n option) found a dirty filesystem; no repairs were made.\n           4       During boot, the root filesystem was found to be dirty; repairs were made, and the\n                   filesystem was remounted.

If that other Mac mounts the filesystem, you can back up your important files. If the filesystem won't mount then you could decide to use file repair/recovery software like disk warrior or data rescue to see about recovering the critical files.\nIf you've got a lot of time on your hands and not a second Mac, I would get a blank external hard drive, boot into (Internet) recovery and reinstall OS X onto that blank USB drive.  Now you have a functioning OSX to see and fix what's wrong with the internal drive or then try to back up what you need.

Here's how the middle find, the one that does the actual work, works:\n$ find TopFolder -name '*.ext' -print\n\nThis finds everything in TopFolder matching the pattern '*.ext', that is all files and directories ending in .ext, and prints the path to each. If you want to limit it to just directories, add -type d.\nwhile read i; do\n\nread i reads from standard input into the shell variable i. while loops until read i returns false, which it does on end-of-file.

The -v is in there just so you can see what's happening, you can leave it out if you want. \"$i\" is the source, quoted in case any element of the path in $i contains spaces. \"${i%.ext}\" is the destination, which is $i, with any trailing .ext removed.\ndone\n\nThis just terminates the while loop.\nNote that this is in bash, it should be doable in other fairly modern shells, but the syntax may be a bit different.\n\nA: You can use a find inline script and parameter expansion.\nfind . -type d -name '*.ext' -exec ksh -c 'for dir\n    do mv \"$dir\" \"${dir%.*}\"\n    done' _ {} +\n\n", "Q: Why does opening the camera app pause music or podcasts on an iPhone 6s? When listening to audio like music, podcasts, or an audio book on an iPhone 6s running iOS 9 the audio pauses when I open the camera app to take a photo. This doesn't happen on other devices. Is there a way to stop it from pausing?\n\nA: Live photos use the microphone to record sound as well as video when you take a picture. Look at the camera settings when you open the app to see whether video is going to happen (or already be happening since it records video from before you press the shutter).\nThere appears to be a bug (that hasn't been fixed yet as of iOS 9.3) on that hardware that makes iPhone 6S worse than others - it pauses even when you are aware of the video aspects and request a non-live photo and non-video recording setting.\n\nA: On iOS 10 the camera app no longer pauses audio on Live Photo capable devices.\n", "Q: Outlook 2016 unable to connect to Exchange 2007 I have just been hired at a new company that does not seem to have much of a Mac presence... yet.

I have a couple of Macs that are required to be held back from upgrade. The requirements are due to (1) use of earlier iPhone/iPad devices, (2) operational requirements, like a particular piece of non-Apple software needs a particular version of OS X, (3) personal preference, like I don't like the color scheme and \"cartoon-ish\" look of the themes on later OS X versions.\nThis week, Apple released a number of security updates.

Since new versions are released annually, that means that any particular version has three years from first release to end of life.\n", "Q: Possible to return to the 3 vertical Mail.app columns? I tried this option, and now sit with the folders on the left in Apple Mail on my Mac, then vertical preview pane (fine), and my full view message pane disappeared.  No amount of 'handle pulling' from\n the right has restored the view.\nI have checked preferences in Mail, and changed between the classic & other layouts to no avail.  HELP.\nI really want to return to the 3 vertical columns (folders, preview, and full view), in that order.  Thanks.\n\nA: Hoshts is correct—I've made a recording showing what it will look like when you \"resize\" the invisible column:\n\n\nA: I ran into this problem in Mail 10.2 (3259) on macOS 10.12.2 Sierra.  The <-| resize handle was not always present, but toggling to Classic view and back again may have affected that.  More importantly, when dragging that handle to the left from the extreme right side of the window, there is no visible effect until moving it a certain distance.  For me it was about half the width of the window.  When reaching that point, the pane appears at that width and follows the drag to the left, but disappears if moved back to the right past that same point.\n\nA: Go to Preferences and open the Viewing tab. There you will see a checkbox that says ‘Use classic layout’. Uncheck that box. You will now have to drag the message preview pane resize bar from the extreme right as you need.\n", "Q: How can I teach Facetime some manners? My niece and her grandma both have iPads1. I have a (Windows) computer with Skype installed. If I'm talking to the niece on Skype and her grandma calls her on Facetime, the niece's iPad immediately puts the Skype call on hold, without so much as a by-your-leave. Is there some way to teach Facetime not to be so rude?\nAs far as I know, everything is the latest version, but this problem has existed through multiple versions. If it matters, the niece uses an iPad 2 with 3G available but not enabled (i.e. nobody has paid for 3G data in months, possibly even years), while grandma has an iPad Mini with no 3G.\n1 Well, technically, the niece has my iPad, but I'm resigned to the fact that I ain't ever getting that thing back from her clutches.\n\nA: Open Settings and go to Notifications > FaceTime. Change the alert style from \"Alerts\" to \"Banners\".\n\n", "Q: how do i remove the restrictions passcode on my iphone 5c i just bought a used iPhone 5c from someone and it has a restrictions passcode on it from the owner before me and I would like to take it off but dont know the passcode is  there anyway I could take It off .?\n\nA: Only buy phones that are factory-reset. If you're able to reset it yourself (Settings > Erase All Content and Settings), then it should remove the restrictions\n", "Q: Multiple Parallels 8 dmg's in my MBA I use Parallels 8 w/my MBA running Mountain Lion so I can use some Office application.\nToday, I noticed I have 4 Parallels related dmg's.

Do they all have separate functions? Once a application is loaded and installed, can't dmg's be trashed?\nThanks-FH\n\nA: The Parallels DMG files you found are the setup downloaded by Parallels when an update is available for your current version.\nYou can keep the most recent one if you want a backup of the latest installation (suggested) or you can trash all the DMG and download again the setup DMG from Parallels site when you will need it again.\n", "Q: Use Mac connected to cable router (no WAN) as the Gateway of the LAN A mac computer (OSX Mavericks) is connected to a TP-Link router via WiFi, as well as a number of other devices. The TP-Link cable router (no ADSL modem), is not connected to a WAN. The mac computer has access to the internet via USB 3G modem. I would like, if possible, to offer my mac's internet connection to the LAN and have the mac act as the gateway of the LAN.\nIn short, replace Internet access of the router through WAN with mac's access to internet through USB 3G modem.\nUSB3G -- Mac -- Router -- Device1, Device2, etc\ni.e. give internet access to Device1, through Mac's internet access of USB3G. It has to pass through the router, therefore using OSX's internet sharing is not an option.\nThanks\n\nA: Internet Sharing\nOpen System Preferences, under the Sharing pane, you can configure Internet Sharing:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Share your connection from: select your 3G USB modem\n\n*To computers using: Select the interface that your router is attached to (I assume ethernet0)\nWith that set, you will need to configure your router to use the iMac as the gateway (by plugging it into the WAN port or somehow configuring that in the router's UI).\n", "Q: Chrome on OS X Yosemite Producing Garbled Graphics A couple of weeks ago Chrome started producing unusably garbled graphics for me, under OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  \nIt's perhaps easier to show than to tell.  For instance, Gmail looks like this:\n\n...seems like it may be some sort of interlacing glitch, as if I adjust the window size I can get vaguely coherent things to display, such as:\n\nI haven't changed any settings in Chrome; the issue seemed to appear at random.  Neither rebooting the computer nor restarting Chrome makes any difference.  Other browsers (Safari, Firefox) work fine, as does every other app on the machine.  The problem seems to be specific to Chrome.\nIs there anything I can do to get Chrome usable again?\nEdit - My chrome version is:\n\nI'm pretty sure that says \"46.0.2490.71\".\n\nA: I believe this was related to Chrome's hardware video acceleration feature, and has been fixed. I had the same issue with an external monitor attached to a USB DisplayLink adapter. After updating to Chrome 46.0.2490.80, the bug (#527556) was resolved.\n\nA: I've seen this too on 2 of my systems. Went away by itself not sure how or why, maybe a Chrome update.\n", "Q: How to run unix script in login screen before user logs in? I would like to have unix script run when the login screen appears when booting. It should run immediately and not when user enters username and password and logs in.\nIs there any way to accomplish this?\n\nA: Launchd and LoginWindow\nYou can use launchd to run your script when the Login Window appears. Within your launchd job ticket, include the key pair:\n<key>LimitLoadToSessionType</key>\n<string>LoginWindow</string>\n\nSave your launchd job ticket, .plist, file in the folder: /Library/LaunchAgents/.\n", "Q: Could I connect a macbook pro to an external hard drive for use with time machine I want to know if connecting a macbook pro to an external hard drive for use with time machine when I am not using it, at night, will work. \nIf I then disconnect it in the morning (regardless of the progress of the time machine OR journaling) will it cause any problems?\nThanks\n\nA: There are third party solutions to schedule the timemachine backups. Backing up to any standard USB external harddrive should not be a problem at all.\nWhile I cannot give you a firsthand review, TimeMachineEditor seems quite popular and reliable:\nhttps://www.google.fr/search?q=timemachineeditor\nWhen disconnecting the harddrive, you should however always make sure that the backup is finished and no write process is currently done. Eject the drive would be the safe thing to do.\n", "Q: Use another Mac connected via thunderbolt as an audio input source? Basically, what I'm trying to do is use one computer with AU Lab to process some audio (real-time, of course) and use that as an audio source for another computer.\nIs it possible to use a thunderbolt-attached Mac as an audio output source or an audio input source, either with or without a third-party application?\n\nA: I don't see how.\nThunderbolt is basically a mux of DisplayPort and PCIe.  So, unless OS X can \"present\" as an audio device the way it presents as a disk drive in \"target mode\" then there really is no way to have another Mac act as an audio device.\n", "Q: Dead battery is replaced and recognized on MacBook Pro – processor speed is still cut Just replaced dead battery on MacBook Pro Late 2011, and it is seen by OS (el Captain) and charging OK. \n\nThough, processor speed is still being cut and ticks only at 0.8 ghz and Apple Hardware test shows 4xxx error with the battery. \n\nDid reset to all that possible, any ideas how to make Macbook see battery on a hardware level?\n\nA: Resolved by using an original battery. \n", "Q: Install Boot Camp 6 Without Internet Connection I'm using an early 2015 MacBook Pro and just updated it to El Capitan. Right now I want to install Windows 10 on my MBPr using Boot Camp. But the problem is, if I don't connect to the internet, Boot Camp Assistant will fail to install saying that it can't download additional software. I already downloaded the Boot Camp Support Software before so I don't want to waste a time to redownload it again.\nIs there any solution for Boot Camp 6 to keep installing Windows without internet connection?\n\nA: You will have to manually do it without using Boot Camp Assistant. This is the best guide I have found (archive 2016-07-09). You will have to create the partition then manually install the drivers once Windows is installed.\n", "Q: Adding Bookmarks for multiple tabs in Safari with a keyboard shortcut In Safari, there is the Add Bookmarks for These N Tabs… function.

The message from parallels was:\nERROR: 15476. Cannot install Parallels Desktop because there is a non-root user account with the UID 0 in your system\nSo this leaves me questioned whether it's a Parallels issue or the permission configurations.\n\nA: Each user on OS X should have a unique identifier.\nGiven that your Mac is not managed and that you do not want the three Other accounts, reassign these accounts to different UID values – or delete them.\nSee Accidentally created user with duplicate UID.

I have the first gen iPad mini. \nSince iOS 9 I have been experiencing app crashes and my iPad getting stuck a lot, but since upgrading to iOS 9.1 my problems have upgraded to my iPad just going black while I'm doing something on it. When I press the home screen button it comes back on for a second before going back again. As if it's constantly locking itself. Tried turning off and on again, didn't work.\nWhat steps should I do to determine if the hardware just broke or if I can fix it with software?\n\nA: One of the things that they always tell you to try is to do either do a full backup to iTunes or iCloud and doing a full iPad reset & restore. (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All etc)\nBut obviously be careful about what apps you have and whether there is data that won't get backed up. There is no 'revert'.\nEliminating the possibility of a software problem is easier for you than determining a hardware problem. If you still have the problem after a full restore...\nDo you have warranty?\n\nA: I've found you only need to reset the iPad. I have iPad mini 1st gen as well. After iOS 9.1 installation, the iPad was sluggish, So I just did factory restore. Now I do not have any issues. Good luck.\n", "Q: Simple way to disable Cellphone (data & call) without disabling WiFi & Bluetooth on iPhone Airplane mode is fine sometimes - but sometimes I want a quick way to turn off my cell circuits (calls / sms / cell data) - without turning off WiFi & Bluetooth.\nAnd no, I don't want to turn on Flight mode then re-enable Cell & Bluetooth (this is specifically not a duplicate of that question).\nI may be playing music on a Bluetooth device, and connected to Wifi - turning those off and on can be extremely disruptive.\nAre there any widgets that can do this say? You should be able to customise control centre to do it\nThanks.\n\nA: Turn on airplane mode, then re-enabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is currently the only option. \nYou can send feedback to Apple here about wanting the ability to turn of Cellular.\n\nA: I agree you should be able to customise the control centre.\nWhat about keeping the sim card pin gadget on your keyring and popping out the SIM tray a little? Too risky?\n", "Q: Defaults documentation for builtin apps? Does Apple supply a list of valid preferences, in terms of key-value pairs found in plist files, for built-in OS X apps?\nFor example, the Preview app has a user setting for anti-aliasing. One can turn this off from the command line with\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFAntiAliasOption -bool no\n\nThis can also be done from the PDF tab of the Preview preferences pane, and if I do the command\ndefaults read com.apple.Preview\n\nI am able to see all of Preview's stored defaults, and might be able to deduce without foreknowledge that PVPDFAntiAliasOption would be the key-value pair to alter to get the desired behaviour.\nBut now suppose I would like to modify other behaviours for Preview, which do not have entries in the preferences pane. Say have the sidebar open by default to the table of contents, instead of thumbnails. Or have the sidebar not open at all.\nI am unable to find documentation on developer.apple.com which even lists the known PVPDFAntiAliasOption, let alone the (non-)existence of unknown keys. Google will find information about this known key, but I haven't found the right combination of search terms to find the desired list. Does documentation exist for these items? Is it provided by Apple?\n\nA: Nope. There are many hidden settings that users figure out themselves, as Apple has not published a list showing which preferences are available\n", "Q: How do I send mass text on an iPhone?

A lot. But, there is a but.\nThe monitor is not sharp (retina, splendid, beautiful) like the second one, the P2415Q that I tried.\nThe second one has 185 PPI (pixel density: 3840x2160 on 23.8\") that make this monitor amazing, beautiful, excellent, LIKE A RETINA DISPLAY!\nBut, another but.\nMy Apple Macbook Pro Retina 13\" 2015 (yes, the last one, the one with 8Gb of RAM) is crappy and lag a lot using Chrome, Safari and other software in any resolution, INCREDIBLY!!! except the last one (3840x2160). I think \nbecause my Mac at the 3840 (4k) resolution doesn't have to manipulate and recalculate any pixel and so it is fast and usable. In other resolutions, also in the Full HD (1920x1080), it is crappy and unusable like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBgLMls-f6I\nI hope this is not a fail of my own Mac, of my own graphic card. Because if just a my problem I have to fix this. Can you confirm this is not just a my problem? Just my pc makes like this? Can you post a scroll on a website with your 13 rMBP?\nSo, for this reasons, now I'm looking for an external monitor to use with my Macbook Pro Retina 13\" 2015 which is at least 21\" (max 22!!!) and Full HD (so my mac have just to be a division by two: from 3840/2=1920 and 2160/2=1080, and it will suffer less that a mathematical operation with height like 1440p or 1600p) but the monitor have to be an UHD one, at least high resolution like DELL P2415Q which have 185 PPI.\nThere is something like this? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I had a similar problem - it is due to your MBP not being able to \"drive\" the larger monitor.  It also has to do with how you are connecting to your monitor.  When I tried to go from mDP (mini DisplayPort) to DVI, there was lag.  But when I went to mDP to DP, the lag was gone.\nThe UltraSharp monitor that I am using is this model:  U2312HM UltraSharp IPS Monitor\nI found this on Apple's Support site.  If you notice the resolutions and frequencies for HDMI go down as the resolution goes up.  This also applies for the other display formats.  You really can't drive anything more than 1080p at 60Hz  the more Hz, the smoother (less choppy) things look.\n\nI will bet that if you tried this monitor on a PC with dedicated graphics, you would see no performance lag.\n", "Q: Downloading iPhone Contacts via USB My father bought an iPhone within months of passing away.  I need to get his contacts off before handing it down to another family member. His paid email account that was associated with his iCloud and iTunes account has been shut down, so I can't download the app that would help me backup his contacts easily.\nHis phone seems to sync fine with my iMac in that it brings up his photos whenever I plug it in and asks if I want to download them.  Is there some way to sync and save his contacts in the same way?\n\nA: Assuming you know his iCloud account details (which you will need anyway in order to remove the activation lock to give the iPhone to a new user) you can download the Contacts as a series of vCards directly from https://www.icloud.com/#contacts\nClick the Gear icon bottom left, 'Select All', then 'Export vCard…' It will download a single file, called [First Contact Name] and [number] others.vcf\ne.g. \"Fred Smith and 27 others.vcf\"\nIt will also try to import them immediately into Contacts on a Mac, but you can cancel that operation if that's not your desired result.\n\n\nA: Actually if you can back up the phone to a computer there a at least a couple of utilities that will allow you to work directly with the backup and extract info from it. Some will also work directly with the phone itself. The one I used a while back is called iExplore and seemed to work pretty well/\n\nA: As others are stating you would need to have access to his iCloud and create a backup. There are ways other than backing up that others have shown as well but all solutions will boil down to logging into iCloud. Since you don't have access to the email account associated with it & the account owner has passed away, the only way to gain access would be to contact Apple to request access to a deceased family member's Apple account.\n", "Q: KeyChain Access and GPG Keychain - should those be running simultaneously?

Thank you.\n\nA: No.  You have no reason to remove Keychain Access and doing so would break important parts of the OS.\n", "Q: Severe Bluetooth Connectivity Issues - OS X Yosemite+El Capitan Ever since Yosemite, Bluetooth connectivity on my very modern MBP w/Retina has been absolute garbage. My workspace includes the Apple wireless keyboard + Magic Trackpad, and I usually am also using Bluetooth headphones (specifically these August EP650's which have been fantastic when paired with other devices/Macs). \nThe problems begin with pairing these devices to the Mac, which usually is around a half hour process of the Mac not finding the devices/refusing to connect. Once connected, it is only a matter of minutes before the devices start to lag out. In the case of the Trackpad, I am referring to the fact that it will be jumpy when trying to scroll, and won't register clicks/taps. The audio on the headphones is even worse, making music or podcasts virtually unlistenable with the constant skips and lag. The keyboard tends to be the most stable of the bunch, but occasionally I will type out a sentence and not see it display on the screen, only to then see the entire thing spell out rapidly a second or two later.\nI have filed an issue with Apple and they have been absolutely useless in resolving this. I send them Bluetooth Diagnostic Reports on about a weekly basis, but they have not responded in over 4 months. This is extremely frustrating as this never used to be an issue before Yosemite+El Capitan. I have wasted numerous hours trying to debug it, such as the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Holding SHIFT+ALT and clicking the Bluetooth icon in the top bar, which reveals the debug menu, and then selecting DEBUG>Reset The Bluetooth Module. This usually results in about a 5 minute 'grace period' before the issues arise again\n\n*From the same debug menu, I've tried \"Factory Resetting All Apple Devices\" which is also useless (and also a pain because I then have to re-pair which takes forever).\n\n*Disabling the Handoff feature (the one useful feature added in Yosemite). This was recommended around 4 months ago when Apple was responding to my bug report.\n\n*Resetting the SMC & PRAM - at first I thought this worked but alas no dice.\n\n*I've tried some other tips that involve setting some BluetoothAudioAgent properties via the terminal and they have (so far) not solved the issue.\n\n\nI thought that El Capitan would resolve this but I was wrong. It in fact got noticeably worse. It is a work machine and the LAN/equipment technician guy here can't figure it out, and because it's not my machine I'm not able to just take it in to Apple (plus I'm not going to pay to repair a machine that isn't mine). On top of that, I don't think this is a repairable hardware issue, because the Bluetooth was working so smoothly before Yosemite.\nAny suggestions you might have are greatly appreciated, I am at my wits end.\n\nA: There is a lot of pain, but you have all the tools you need to isolate the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 10.9 on an external drive. \n\n*Install 10.10 on an external drive. \n\n*Install 10.11 on an external drive. \n\n\nIt is important to get a totally clean install of the three items above. You can then use a notebook to write down the exact times and OS when Bluetooth if flakey. If it's really the software drivers, you will have statistical evidence of that after 10 to 20 data points. The down side of this, troubleshooting like this is expensive time-wise and we don't ever get that time back. \nI hate to throw hardware at an issue, but wired devices or upgrading to Apple's newer hardware have helped in areas where I had clients with noisy 2.4 Ghz environments. The new hardware is Bluetooth low energy and superior to the old devices in terms of resilience and the amount of time to link back up when they inevitably disconnect. As a bonus, they work over USB in the case of the new \"magic\" keyboard and trackpad devices. Other third party options also exist with transmitters that don't depend on the Bluetooth stack. \nMake a \"budget\" for your troubleshooting effort and buy a solution that you could return if it doesn't solve our issue. Since it happens so often, you should be able to know with Apple’s 14 day return window if the new hardware will solve your pain. (And if it's cheaper once you put a $ value on your time to troubleshoot the issue further.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Mac OS X Bluetooth service?\nAlso, this answer to the above question has some critical information on using the debug menu to factory reset things. You might try each of these (writing down what you do and when - leaving a little time between each option) to see if a reset helps. The logging and diagnostic report will also help if you need to engage Apple support to troubleshoot the issue. Sometimes looking at the logs has helped me identify a failure.\nBest of luck - I'm curious what you find out.\n", "Q: What are the different internet connection types used by ifconfig and ipconfig?

I would like to print one frame of this video as a still picture. I tried taking a screen shot of it, but ended up with the menu on the top and bottom of the picture. Is there an easier way of keeping one frame of a video as a still picture?\n\nA: If you tap the screen, the top and bottom bars disappear, and you can take your screen shot then. However, taking a screenshot may give you a lower quality result that may not look nice printed out. iMovie (Mac or for iPhone) should be able to do this without a loss in quality, as well as other video editors / certain video players (e.g. VLC).\n\nA: There are several apps if you want to do it on iphone. \nI used Vhoto for a while ago.

It doesn't seem to happen when playing a video on the device, only when playing over Airplay.\n\nA: I have the hdmi adapter and I think iOS handles that the same way as air play does.\nSome apps like Amazon Video or the movies app have a good support for AirPlay. I can lock my iPhone and it will go on. But the last time I checked YouTube it didn't had the good support, it only mirrored the screen.\nI think this is a problem of the app you are using.\n", "Q: iphone 4s< update and find my iphone An iphone 4s at iOS 9.0.2 is asking to upgrade to iOS 9.1\nThe problem is that we know it's activation locked and we don't have control of that Apple ID.\nSince I cant disable it if I can't remember a password.

But if your time capsule dies then you could copy these files back to a new Time Capsule or a repaired Time Capsule.\nSee pondini.org.\n\nA: The only way you can back up a Time Machine disk is to create a disk image, as TM uses special hard links to backup differential items. \nYou can add another disk to your Time Machine preferences. OS X will then back up to each one, switching every hour (i.e. 1:00: HD, 2:00: TC, 3:00: HD, 4:00: TC, etc...).

After upgrading to El Capitan I get an initial login screen with my name and round icon, which wants my iCloud password. After that I get the username and password screen, where I enter my local username and password.\nI want to just enter my local username and password. Is there a way to disable the iCloud login? I seem to recall selecting something related to that when installing, but I don't see anything about it in my login preferences.\n\nA: It turns out the main issue is that I'm using FaultVault encryption. On restart, the login screen showing user photos is part of FileVault, and happens before booting OS X, so it doesn't utilize the login screen preferences.\nWhen you simply logout, you're shown the actual OS X login screen, as the machine is already booted. That screen does utilize the preferences and appears as I expected.\n\nA: This has never happened to me, but it seems to be as simple as turning off all iCloud-related services and logging out of all iCloud-enabled apps:\n\nThe solution is to go to System Preferences, iCloud and clear all the ticks so      that you are no longer syncing anything to iCloud. You should also go into every Apple app (FaceTime, Calendar, Messages, iTunes, Reminders, Notes and any other app you can think of), check the preferences in each app and if you are signed in to iCloud then sign out.\nAfter disabling all the iCloud sync options in System Preferences and every single Apple app, return to iCloud in System Preferences and tick all the boxes again to start syncing once more. You might also need to sign in again with FaceTime and the other apps you signed out of. I don’t think you need to restart the Mac, but try it if you still have problems.\n\nGleaned from this page.\n", "Q: What is coupond?

I use Dashlane to store passwords, and I like it, but there's one problem I've had with it. I use Activity Monitor to see what's going on, and something strange has been happening with Dashlane lately.\n\nBoth DashlaneAgent and DashlanePluginService are using almost 50,000 ports. This wouldn't bother me as much as the fact that both port counts continue to rise as my computer runs, up to 90,000 in one case. \nI have 3 questions pertaining to this mystery:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is using this amount of ports intentional for Dashlane? (i.e. why would they need so many?)\n\n*Do other people experience this phenomenon?\n\n*Does high port usage cause computer problems?\n\n\nA: For those who are unaware, these \"ports\" in question are not network ports, they are Mach kernel ports and are used by the kernel for interprocess communication.  There is a fixed number of Mach ports that your system can have open, so to answer your third question; yes, this could cause problems for you as you approach that limit.  Given that the port count is so high, increases to as high at 90K or more, and that nothing else on the system is using anything close to that number of ports, I think it is safe to say that Dashlane is leaking Mach ports.\nTo answer your first question, I would say that this is unintentional behavior on the part of Dashlane.\nAnd to answer your second question, I am not experiencing this issue; so some other people do not experience it.\nCheck out this great post on leaking Mach ports in Chrome for more geeky information:\nhttps://robert.sesek.com/2012/1/debugging_mach_ports.html\nWhat I would do in your case:\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Dashlane.  Also delete files from ~/Library/Applicaiton Support/Dashlane\n\n*Reinstall Dashlane using the installer on their website\n\n*Watch to see if the problem returns, and if it does, contact Dashlane support with the version numbers of the software you are running.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 and iPad picking up different location settings for search and ads iPad and iPhone think they're in a different country.

Don't have access to my phone at the moment but I think it's Settings > WiFi > (your wifi) > advanced (look for the words DNS or URL somewhere)\nSometimes apps suggest putting in a custom url in there, and they essentially work as a proxy.

Being a student, spending around 100 euros on a new charger was not an option. So I found a 10-years-experience-in repairing-electronics-company and they replaced my power cord today for around 25 euros. \nThe process was opening the 'main-box aka the charger itself', cutting the power cord and replacing it with a new one from what they told me (wasn't done in front of me). The charger looks like brand new (by brand new I mean, looks like before the operation, they didn't cracked the case or used duct tape to close it after the process was over) so apparently they didn't lied around the part that they are pro. They also told me that the replacement cord is genuine.\nNow, how can I actually check if it is genuine as I am concerned to not get my Macbook fried. Or should I ask what are the risks of having a fake power cord ? Tho' I suppose having a power cord fake should be less dangerous than the entire charger.\nI am asking these questions as the MagSafe2 adapter looks quite shady, as the light from the charging LED is leaking around the cord. I attached a picture to be more specific.\n\nAfter they replaced the cord and tested the charger so I could see that the laptop is charging they went through the menu and showed me some info regarding the power (60W) and infos I simply did not understood. I will post a picture of that screen with those informations. As I do not know how they were before replacing the charger, I cannot compare to the current values.\n\nThank you\n\nA: It isn't.  Apple does not sell replacement parts and does not license the Magsafe to anyone.\n\nA: You get this AC charger information provided by Magsafe connector, not by power adapter. A power adapter is connected to a Magsafe T connector only by two cables. Magsafe T Connector has 5 pins. 2 outer pins for ground/-, 2 inner pins for power/+, and the middle pin for communication between T connector and the Mac. If the battery is fully charged and the led in the connector changes to green, you will get the same information but the above charging info change to No. What makes Apple chargers expensive is the adapter, not the cable/connector. So beware of fake adapters. \nFor more information, see http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html.\n", "Q: Juniper Network Connect hangs at “Establishing Secure Session” after upgrading to OS X El Capitan I have a problem trying to connect to a VPN using \"Juniper Network Connect\". It happened after I upgraded from Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) to Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11).\nEver since I upgraded to OS X El Capitan, though, Juniper Network Connect (VPN client) stopped working. First it just wouldn't launch. I also upgraded to the latest Java version from Oracle. Now although Network Connect launches it hangs at the \"Establishing Secure Session\" step. It seems as though the connection is established (since I lose internet access in this period) but it can't create a tunnel.\nBefore I had the same problem, and solved it using the solution provided here only making this:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nBut for \"El Capitan\" it's not working.\nHere are some lines of the log:\n\n20151022170309.742528 Network Connect[p430.t2567] ncsvccontrol.error The service failed to configure the tunnel (ncsvccontrol.mm:262) \n20151022170309.856101 Network Connect[p430.t2567] nc.mac.app.1202.error DSError 0x2cbc0fa0 domain=nc.mac.app code=1202\n  \"ncproxyd failed to establish a tunnel, status = 4\"\n  20151022170310.316057 Network Connect[p430.t76719] dsssl.error Cert hash is not SHA256. len=32 (DSSSLSock.cpp:1781)\n\n\nA: As of July, it appears Juniper is still working on this.

Find the item number in the array where you have the App Store and open the item to see the sub properties.\n\n*Open property \"tile-data\" as well. Now you should see a sub property \"dock-extra\" of type BOOLEAN. \n\n*In the property \"file-data/_CFURLString\" or the property \"bundle-identifier\" you can check if you really found the correct item number for the App Store.\n\n*Change the value of from \"dock-extra\" from YES to NO and than save and close the plist.\n\n*Restart your Dock at a terminal with command \"killall Dock\" or reboot your system.\n\n\nI create a small shell script that does the same job. It uses the terminal tool \"PlistBuddy\" that comes together with Xcode.\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"set persistent-apps:7:tile-data:dock-extra false\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nsync\nkillall Dock\n\nThe \"7\" in the script stands for the array position of the app store in the dock as explained in step 3 above (and needs to be adjusted to your configuration).\nThis method has still problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The red notification badge of App Store is only gone as long as the App Store is closed. As long as you open the App Store you see the red notification badge anyway.\n\n*When you move the position of App Store in your Dock (maybe because you add a new application to it) the \"dock-extra\" value is automatically reset to \"YES\" and you will see the red notification badge again. Than you need to repeat the process for the new Item position of the App Store in your Dock.\n", "Q: My (unbroken) iPhone won't turn on! I have an iPhone 5. The only issue it's had is that the battery life wasn't so great as it once was... until now.\nEarlier the battery went flat and it switched to this screen\n\nTotally normal.\nSo I plugged it into a portable USB battery that I use in situations like this. But after 30 minutes it still didn't turn on. Then I tried it through the original mains plug and 12 hours later it still didn't turn on. Then I plugged it in via a computer's USB port and 8 more hours it still won't turn on. \nNow it's been 72 hours and probably 48 of those plugged into power without turning on. \nUnlike many others who have asked this or similar questions, my phone isn't damaged...\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried holding the power button.\n\n*I've tried holding the power button and home button - for 10 seconds.\n\n*I've tried charging it with different cables.\n\n*I've tried charging it with different power sources.\n\n*I've tried plugging it into a computer running itunes.\n\n\nHow do I get my iPhone running again?\n\nA: You should get someone to open up your iPhone, disconnect the battery, and reconnect it. That's where I would start with it, it may be something more serious, but there's a pretty good chance just that the disconnection and reconnection of the battery on the logic board could work. You could try to do it yourself, but it requires taking off the touchscreen (digitizer) assembly, about a dozen small screws, and a few other parts like EMI shields. It's not too difficult, but if you decide to do it, you'll need to buy tools online and repair guides at iFixit.\n", "Q: How to reset iPhone to factory settings? I dropped my iPhone 6 and the screen is a goner. I ordered a replacement but it requires that I mail my broken phone to them after. The thing is is that my phone still works, I can hear my phone receive texts and notifications, but the touch screen is not responsive. Another big thing is that I am unable to connect to iTunes on it as well. Every time I connect it, it continuously connects and disconnects. Is there a way to reset my phone to its factory settings without a working screen and without iTunes? I really do not want to send in my phone with all my personal information and apps on it. \n\nA: Is it signed in to Find My iPhone? If so you can go to http://icloud.com, select your phone and click erase iPhone.\n\nA: If you did not configure iCloud with find my phone you could try to let the battery drain (to switch it off) and then switch it on by\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing the home button\n\n*connect it to a computer (USB)\n\n\nWhen connected it will start in recovery mode and then you might be able to wipe it with iTunes.\n\nA: The good news is that the damage that's preventing you from racing the phone also will prevent someone from connecting it to another iTunes and getting any sort of information from the device.\nThe level of security that you have depends on the version of iOS on the phone.  If you have a passcode and power of the device in the encryption keys will be gone until someone enters the pass code correctly or it's connected to an iTunes computer that the phone already trusts.\nThe other answers cover how thing should work: connect to iTunes and erase the device using the restore button, logging in to iCloud and sending an erace command to it.  I'll add a third option: put the phone in recovery mode and see if it's more stable to allow iTunes the time it needs to erase your data from the device. \n", "Q: New top-of-the-line MacBook Pro suddenly starts acting old About a week ago, I got a new MacBook Pro. I work a decent bit in video editing, among other things, so I had the processor upgraded to the highest available model. The box arrives, I open it, and my word the computer is incredible. Battery life often surpasses 8 hours when running a host of programs simultaneously, everything happens instantaneously, El Capitan is spectacular, the force touch trackpad is incredibly click-like. Basically, the computer is everything I ever expected.\nI install a few programs, go about my business, and about a day ago the computer suddenly starts acting weird. I'd definitely call myself a power user, so I'm not sure if it's something most people would notice, but the computer noticeably gets slower, battery life decreases to 4 hours on a charge with few programs running, the computer gets hot, internet misbehaves, and strangely enough, I think Safari acts differently, too. Until I tried Safari on the new computer, I had always been a Chrome person, so I'm not sure, but if I remember correctly a few days ago I could type a URL into the Safari address bar, click enter, and have it load. Now, I type a URL in and hit enter, and the URL gets selected, and I need to hit enter a second time to search. It's subtle, but I think it's a change. Moreover, Mail stops working properly, and now everything I send gets stuck in the outbox, I have this strange window that doesn't seem to belong to any program on screen:\nI have clicked the bar and the search button, and nothing seems to happen. The App Store isn't trying to install updates, as far as I can tell, and the window doesn't change the application name in the upper left corner of the screen when I click it. I try opening Safari and get this friendly window:\nSo I am now typing this question in Chrome. I've downloaded Sophos to see if it can detect any malware, but the scan grinds to a near-halt about 65,000 files from the end of the drive. The hard drive has about 50GB of files in it, and I certainly don't remember putting that much stuff in there in the past week.\nBasically, the computer is acting strangely, and I have no idea why. Any ideas?\n\nA: Have you tried using Activity Monitor to see what fishy processes are running? Also, you can try creating a new account and use it for a while to see if it's something that only happens on your main account. I'd recommend you to use something like iStat Menus to check on what's clogging your processing power, network, etc\n\nA: You can try to clean install the OS X and see the difference. I'm using Macbook Pro early 2015 and it work very well\n", "Q: Only show local media files in iTunes in El Capitan I finally upgraded to El Capitan and now iTunes is a jumbled mess. I took a long time organizing my music library and I had iTunes to only show media stored on my Macbook. \nNow every purchase I've ever made with my account is just thrown in with my carefully curated libraries creating duplicates and some weird cases triplicates. I don't know why I can't find this option anymore and I honestly don't want to deal with iCloud Music Library. All I want is just to show music/movies/tv shows that are only on my device.\nCan someone please help me or is this another option Apple has so graciously decided for us?\n\nA: You have to turn off Apple Music in the General settings of the iTunes app. Press Command , and uncheck the box. \n\n\nA: In case any one is in a similar position, I've figure it out. The option is not under preferences in El Capitan (at least it wasn't for me). It's under the View tab. There is an option to show/hide iCloud purchases for each media type. I always expect options like this to be in the preferences pane (like it used to be) that I didn't even check the menu bar. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Issues & Errors with Restore from ios7 Backup to ios9 on iPhone 5?

The jPhone won't show up in the MBP's AirDrop window (accessed from Finder>Go>AirDrop) and vice versa. \nI was able to use my phone with another MBP with Mavericks flawlessly. I also tried to directly link them using Bluetooth (since AirDrop works via Bluetooth) and they were still unable to discover each other. I'm not sure whether this worked on Yosemite.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Not sure what was wrong with the Bluetooth discoverability, but I found a fix. It also fixes AirDrop since Bluetooth is its underlying technology.\nYou just need to delete a certain file, in my case I chose to rename it so I still had the original. You can do that using Finder or in the Terminal with the following command:\nsudo mv /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist.orig\nDo this then restart Bluetooth and your devices should now be discoverable.\n\nA: In order for my air drop to work on my MAC, I changed my firewall settings.\n~System Preferences\n~Security & Privacy\n~Click the lock\n~Firewall Options\n~ \"Blocked all-\" should be UNchecked (it's the very first box at the top.)\n~Make sure you allow every option that pops up\n", "Q: Hiding finder preview panel... forever I'm not sure why but quite recently Finder likes to show me the Preview panel on new Finder windows. \nI've tried every method I could find:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hiding the preview.

I've just purchased a WD Elements external hard drive and plan to use it across Linux, OS X and Windows devices (read and write on every OS).\nIs there any file format by which I could format my HDD so that I could read and write across all these OSs?\n\nA: FAT32 works on every system, but files cannot be larger than 4GB in size.\nThere is exFAT, which works with larger files, but it isn't natively supported by Linux. You can however see this link how to get it working on Ubuntu for example (read and write support with this solution). \n\nA: Beware of the downsides of using FAT32 with HFS+ files. Personally, I'd install FUSE on the mac and the linux box and then choose a file system that all 3 will support like NTFS.\nNote that @deadderek's answer contains a link to a question with an answer that explains how to install FUSE with exFAT support on Ubuntu.

But this answer to the question Switch focus in split view makes it seem like there is no way to do this by default either across 2 different apps or within two instances of the same app.\nIn it they suggest using ⌘` for moving between two instances of the same app, and the closest by default would be ⌘⇥ for different apps.\n\nA: I accomplished this by binding a keystroke to the \"Move focus to active or next window\" shortcut. It's under the \"Keyboard\" category on the \"Shortcuts\" tab of the Keyboard settings in System Preferences.\n\nA: I have Safari in Split View and the keyboard shortcut of command + tilde (  ⌘ + ` ) works perfectly in 2023 on MacOS Venture (13.2).\nThis was mentioned in @mpacer's answer in 2015 but at that time it appeared like it wasn't a standard solution.\n", "Q: How to get rid of the \"ears\" in the bottom of the screen?

It is, however similar to the Vista/Win7/8/10 task bar but leaves out out the Start menu and system tray. \nNotifications don't show up in the system tray, rather in the Notification center which will display a pop-up on the right side of the screen (starting at the top). The clock will display in the menu bar if you configure it to do so.\nYour so called \"ears\" is just blank desktop to either side of the dock and if that empty space bothers you, you could either do the Dock show/hide preference or fill the dock so full with apps and documents that it fills the screen side to side.\nThere are also Dock alternatives out there if you don't like the one that comes with Mac OS.\n\nA: Wow, I have found this:\nhttp://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar\nThis looks like the Windows 7 taskbar I was using and loving for so long.

The method this program uses is edit your /etc/hosts file and redirect your blacklist of sites (facebook.com, youtube.com, etc) to 0.0.0.0. This is cool, but I was thinking that I could make a Keyboard Maestro macro for this instead. \nI'm new to Keyboard Maestro and it's a bit intimidating to get into. Does anyone have any recommendations for creating a macro that will open, append, save, and then close your system's hosts file?\n\nA: Have Keyboard Maestro run an AppleScript, which runs a shell script, which changes your hosts file:\ndo shell script \"cp ~/hosts.tmp /etc/hosts\" with administrator privileges\n\nSimple! :)\nThe \"with administrator privileges\" part will cause it to prompt you for the sudo password.\n\nA: [This is not an answer, and I wanted to post this as comment, but my low “reputation” score doesn’t allow it:]\nKeyboard Maestro has an excellent forum now. A quick search in the Keyboard Maestro forum showed me that you didn’t post your question there, so I think it’s worth mentioning it.\nTo add some content:\nThe macro won’t be a problem, but the sudo password:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is tempting, but don’t just store your sudo password in a Keyboard Maestro variable or in a named clipboard.\n\n*Keyboard Maestro provides some special treatment for “password variables”. From the KM documentation: \n\nVariables with names that start or end with “Password” or “PW” are considered passwords – their values will not be stored (except in memory) and they cannot be read directly by shell scripts or AppleScripts, though their consequences can easily be extracted, eg with the Set Clipboard to Text action. The Prompt For User Input dialog will display such variables in a password field.\n\nSo this may be a possibility to access the hosts file in an automated way: Get the sudo password with the “Prompt for User Input” action and store it for example in a variable PW. But I can’t tell how secure this really is.\n\n\n*\n\n*Another possibility would be to manipulate the sudoers file with visudo, so that you can write to the hosts file without entering the sudo password. But I wouldn’t do that in case of the hosts file!\n\n", "Q: Can I prevent \"Photos\" app from loading?

Push notifications have been with the iPhone almost since inception. If you want to disable those, go to the Settings app and then Notifications. Choose the app in question and disable all notifications. \nIf you have disabled Background App Refresh, then that is set and it is disabled.

It has a 2.9 GHz i5 processor and a 1 TB fusion drive along with 8 GB of RAM. I recently upgraded it to El Capitan.\nA couple of months ago it randomly started to not wake up after being asleep. We would have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it back on. It also would just randomly shut off while we were using it. If we had music playing, the screen would go black and the music would stop so it's not a display issue.\nI took it in to our local Apple store and talked to them about it and they said the first thing they would do would be to reinstall OS X. So I decided to do that myself but that still did not fix the issue.\nI then lugged it back into the Apple store about 2 weeks ago and left it with them for a few days to get to the bottom of it. They repaired OS X and then put it through a battery of tests to see if there were any issues with memory or the hard drive but everything came back fine. They then left it plugged in with a bunch of graphics programs and videos playing and still had no issues.\nAt this point, I was thinking it was a power issue with the plug we were using. When I brought it home, we left it plugged in and running in our dining room for a few days and did not have any issues. I gradually loaded programs back on and still did not have any issues. I then moved it back upstairs but the other day it started acting up again on my wife. I moved it back to our dining room thinking it was the outlet up there, but it's exhibiting the same behavior there now.\nAfter doing some searching online, I found this post http://samwize.com/2013/10/13/imac-shutdown-suddenly-and-randomly/. It seems to describe the issue we are having.\nI was able to check the Console and it says the cause for shutdown is 0. I'm pretty sure the Apple store ran the hardware test and memtest while it was there. I have repeatedly reset the SMC, which the Apple store employee informed me is basically what I'm doing every time I have to unplug it and plug it back in.\nThe only thing I haven't done yet is a PRAM reset.\nSo, now I'm not sure what to do next. According to that post, his logic board needed to be replaced. The Apple store quoted me $583.32 to replace the logic board if that was what was needed. But I only want to do that if I know definitively that's the issue.\nSo sorry for the long post, but does anyone have a suggestion on how to  root cause this?\n\nA: Chances are this is a bad power supply board.\n\nShutdown error codes can be negative or positive values; negative being hardware and positive being software.\nA \"0\" code is right there in the middle where it usually means a sudden loss of power.  See this post for more info:  Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?\nIf any part of your logic board was beginning to fail, it would generate kernel panics which would be in the log and likewise, if you had software causing issues, there would be a log of a crash somewhere.\nI've see this previously on other platforms whether it was a Mac, or a PC, or even enterprise grade servers.  What is probably happening is that a component in your power supply is getting too hot and consequently shutting down.  If you take it to the Apple store, they probably have the ambient temperature much lower than you home so it never has a chance to over heat. Just when you think everything is good, the symptoms return.\nIs your downstairs location warmer or cooler than the upstairs location where it normally resides?\nIf you need to replace your power supply, rest assured these are fairly easy to come by and fairly inexpensive.  At the time of this post, they were trending around $65.   It's also very easy to replace (see the guide at ifixit.com)\nWhile you are in there, I would swap out your (spinning) HDD with a SSD. I just installed a Samsung 850 EVO SSD in my 27\" iMac and it is substantially quieter and cooler than before.\nDisclaimer:  There still is a chance it's the logic board, but it's highly unlikely.  Before you do any expensive logic board replacements, try replacing the power supply first.  \nOne more thing....I would definately follow agentroadkill's advice from his comment and put a UPS (battery backup) between the outlet and your Mac.\n\nA: i had the same issue with my iMac 2010 edition, i read that apparently my hard drive was failing and thought why not give it a shot and replace it, once i did the problem did stop.

Because i see 2.1GB inside the iCloud Backup, and then 1.7Gb inside document and settings.\n\nA: Yes, if you have device backup and WhatsApp chat backup turned on, you will indeed be making two backups for WhatsApp. In my case, this means 2 x 1.5GB.\nThe following unofficial info should help you make a decision on whether to keep both, or turn one of them off. Disclosure, this is not my info, I did find it elsewhere:\n\nThe iCloud backup and having the device backup does duplicate data.\n  Backing up the phone will back up whatsapp, so if you restored to a\n  new phone even without enabling the inbuilt backup your data would be\n  there.\nIf you enable the whatsapp iCloud backup you are able to restore your\n  data to a new phone, without performing a full iCloud restore.\n  Personally I would keep the in built whatsapp backup enabled and\n  untick it from the complete iPhone backup. I swap my backup often\n  between my two phones using just the built in whatsapp feature,\n  without restoring etc.\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/3pz8hh/how_does_the_whatsapp_app_backup_work/\n\nA: Go to WhatsApp - Settings - Chats - Backup, and see how much space Whatsapp is trying to upload (you can choose to not include videos to reduce most of the size)\nNow, there are 2 Whatsapp backup switches to handle, they are both on by default, hence, by default, WhatsApp is an odd and inconvenient outlier since (compared to iCloud Photo library) it literally duplicates the space required if both switches are on, let me explain:\n1st switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > scroll down to see the switch (this switch creates a live backup that allows for an independent backup, meaning you don't need to restore your whole iPhone to restore this backup, you can delete WhatsApp Only and said backup will be detected when you reinstall WhatsApp). You get to pick your frequency\n2nd switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > Manage Storage > click \"Backup\" green icon row > Click your device > here you have a list of your TOTAL apps, each might save a tiny bit of settings info for each app (not the app itself), this is a packaged backup that also saves your downloaded app list (no matter if you switch off every app). So, Here you see WhatsApp too (2nd switch) <- if on, Whatsapp backup will take 2x space of your total iCloud space. As I understand, this backup can only be accessed if you restore the whole iPhone (whole package see).\nPost-context: for years, I've turned off the 2nd switch with no problems. But ever since iOS 13, background activity is a mess for WhatsApp, and even though I have more than enough space, auto-daily WhatsApp backup is not happening. I now have the question if I can invert the switches, and still be able to access WhatsApp backup by only deleting and reinstalling the WhatsApp app, not the whole iPhone. This question arises since the packaged backup (2nd switch) for the rest of the apps (including WhatsApp) works flawlessly, daily, perfectly fine.\nTIP: It doesn't matter if you have iCloud Photo library on on both sections, Apple is smart about this and only backups once (only takes space one time), that's why I say WhatsApp is an inconvenient-odd outlier when it comes to both switches management.\nWith all this, maybe your backup is stuck since you have a 2.5Gb WhatsApp backup to be uploaded, which (if both switches on) requires 5Gb of free space. <- but in my case, not even having the double free space does the trick, auto-backup is not happening.\n\nA: Yes, if you let both options enabled, your iCloud storage will have two WhatsApp backups.\nMore information: http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/iphone/20888066\n\nA: To get Whatsapp Chat backup working after getting stuck, I had to manually delete the existing Whatsapp data from iCloud.

Hilarious, right?\nWell I was using the e-mail app this morning, and when looking at a few e-mails I sent last night, I noticed that my name was put as \"Sugar Daddy\" in those e-mails as well. I then realized that Siri had put \"Sugar Daddy\" as my nickname (while retaining my real first and last names) in Contacts and that the e-mail app displays the nicknames of contacts.\nIs there any chance the people I sent e-mails to also saw my name as \"Sugar Daddy\" in the sender field? At least one of them uses iOS himself. Please tell me this is not possible... I realize this is unlikely, but I just want to make sure.\nBtw, I'm honestly not trolling, this seriously happened to me.\n\nA: I had to laugh - but there's a serious question here, for sure. \nDoes a nickname in your Contacts show to anyone else?\nEmpirically, I would say no - neither a nickname you give yourself nor any other contact will be transmitted.\nMy partner & I have each other listed in Contacts with the nickname \"ICE\" [In Case of Emergency] yet it doesn't show up in any messages or emails we send to each other.\nSimilarly, my own nickname of Tetsujin is not seen by others in any communication I send.\nI'm pretty sure you're safe asking Siri to call you Sugar Daddy… unless she does it in public, or if you ever intend to pass your vCard to someone, because it certainly will be in the exported card  ;)\n\nA: Unfortunately, the nickname does indeed transmit. I just received an email and chose “reply all.” The sender’s nickname for herself and for the other contacts in the CC box included her nicknames for me, my husband, and her husband.

I have two Mac book Pros: \n\n\n*\n\n*A 2013 Unibody retina that I use every day\n\n*An older 2006 model with removable battery that I use a couple of times a month (when not in use, it's not connected to the AC. I\nrecently replaced the battery, as the old one swelled apart).\n\n\nI use them as desktop replacements, so I don't use the battery that often. \nWhat's the best way to prolong battery lifespan? - If keeping the machines hooked up to the AC is a bad idea, then for how many hours each day should I use the battery?\n\nHere is my research: There's a lot of conflicting advice. \nCalibration\nA lot of sources, say you should calibrate the battery by letting it run down to 0% each month. For example, this Ask Different question, this Gigaohm article. All these articles were written in 2013/12 and cite Apple.com as the source for this advice.\nHowever, the Apple.com page makes no reference to calibration. Is this because calibration is a bad idea, or is it because Apple no longer sells devices with removable batteries and so the advice is different?\nDeep discharge\nOther sources, such as this AskDifferent question, imply that letting the battery drain is a bad idea, so using the AC whenever possible is actually a good thing. \nPlease note I am talking about the overall battery life span (e.g. the time the battery has before it needs to be replaced) and not increasing the day-to-day hours of the battery. \n\nA: What's the best way?\nDon't worry about it and just use your MacBook Pros for what you bought them for.\nWhy?\nPhysics.  No matter what you do, you can't change the laws of physics and lithium batteries are governed by the number of cycles.  A complete discharge and recharge is one cycle.  A 20% discharge 5 times is one cycle, a 5% discharge 20 types is one cycle. \nWhether that cycle takes a half day, a full day or a week all depends on how you use it; but I am guessing you didn't buy a MBP to sit on a shelf all day long doing nothing.  \nEven when you keep your MBP plugged in, you are reducing the per day cycle count; however you are not eliminating it.  But the bigger question is, did you buy a MBP to sit at a desk all day?  If so, you should have bought an iMac instead - there's no battery so you eliminate this problem altogether.\nThat said, there are things you can avoid that will shorten the life of your battery and those things include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extreme temperatures - high heat and freezing temps can kill a battery prematurely.\n\n*Drops and physical stress can damage the battery shortening its life\n\n*Not using the right charger can harm your battery.  Always use a GENUINE power adapter, not some discount charger you find on eBay.  \nWhen they do die, it's always best to get a good quality replacement battery from a reputable manufacturer.  The 2006 MBP uses an external battery so it's fairly easy to find replacements - and some even come with generous warranties.  \nThe 2013 MBP Retina batteries require the back cover to be removed, but are actually pretty easy to replace.  You can find many good replacements now on the aftermarket, with generous warranties as well.  \nWhen you get down to it, the battery prices are not that all off putting.\nThe bottom line is that you batteries have a life span that's governed by use and there is nothing you can do short of not using your MacBook to change that.  But...that kind of defeats the purpose of having the MacBook in the first place.  \n", "Q: The reason for Previous shutdown cause: -128 My MacBook Pro 11,2 (Retina 2014) shuts down suddenly from time to time.

This should be done on a working copy of the layout bundle, not an installed one, and may not work in newer versions of OS X (I could not get it to work under High Sierra). If changing the ID doesn't work for you, logging out and back in again should reload keyboard layouts.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Open a working copy of the layout bundle in Ukelele. Note this can't be an installed, active layout (i.e. one in a relevant \"Library/Keyboard Layouts\" folder).\n\n*Generate a new ID:\n\n*\n\n*In Ukelele's list of keyboard layouts for the bundle, right-click the layout and choose \"Set Keyboard Name and Script…\".\n\n*Change the script (e.g. from \"Unicode\" to \"Roman\"), taking note of the original value.\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Repeat the last 3 steps and change the script back to the original value.\n\n*Save the layout.\n\n\n\n*If an older copy of the layout is installed, remove it from the relevant \"Keyboard Layout\" folder.\n\n*Copy the updated layout to the relevant \"Keyboard Layout\" folder.\n\nUnder the hood, this changes the \"id\" attribute of the root <keyboard> element in Contents/Resources/<name>.layout within the bundle.\n", "Q: OS X: Change sharing-only account to 'normal' account Somehow, OS X changed my main user account to sharing-only.

I never backed up anything. What is this backup? How can i delete them?\n\nA: If Time Machine is enabled, this is (probably) a Local Snapshot. These allow Time Machine to back up your files even when a backup disk is not available. However, OS X automatically deletes these as space is used up. From the Apple Knowledge Base:\n\nTo make sure that you have storage space when you need it, Time Machine creates and retains local snapshots only when there is plenty of free space on your startup drive:\n\n*\n\n*If less than 20% of the total storage space on your startup drive is available, Time Machine removes local snapshots, starting with the oldest, until you have more than 20% free space.\n\n\n*If less than 10% or less than 5GB of storage space is available, Time Machine removes local snapshots more quickly. When only one snapshot remains, Time Machine stops creating new snapshots. As free space increases, Time Machine at first replaces the previous snapshot with a new one, then eventually resumes creating snapshots as normal.\n\nIf you need to free up space used by this remaining snapshot, disable Time Machine and it will be deleted. However, this means you won't have backups, which is not a good idea. If you want to disable local snapshots, run this Terminal command:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nIf this doesn't delete the local snapshot, disable Time Machine until it is removed and enable it again.\nFor more information/troubleshooting regarding disabling Local Snapshots, read this forum discussion.\n", "Q: How to restart or shutdown a Mac when it says app running but cannot force quit the app?

I've lost a lot of time on this. Enough so that I'd suggest getting a simple good quality router and setting it up to pick up the wifi ethernet and redistribute it via ethernet. Make sure to set the access point router to act as a bridge (i.e. it would continue to obtain DHCP addresses from the central router). That way you can share to other devices on the master network.\nYou may find you get faster and more reliable internet on your MacBook Pro as well as the aluminum hulls are not particularly reception friendly, especially in comparison with a router with proper antennas which can be positioned as you like.\nI'm doing something similar but using powerline adapters (more reliable than wifi) to bring the internet to the access point router.\n\nA: I don't know if this will work universally, however I solved the problem in the following way.\nOn Mac OS X Machine\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet -> Configure IP v4 OFF\n\n*Wifi connected to AP with relevant settings\n\n*Sharing -> Internet sharing ON WIFI to ETHERNET\n\n*Terminal -> ifconfig -> Should now see \"bridge100\" device, with address something like 192.168.2.1, probably not particularly relevant since this is self assigned by OS X\n\nOn Linux Machine\n\n*\n\n*Configure ethernet, leave in DHCP mode\n\nShould just work. Issue for me was that I left the ethernet connection with a DHCP assigned IPv4 under 'network settings', rather than disabling it. For some reason that interferes with the settings from 'sharing'. I guess because the OS tries to assign values for 2 different interfaces on the same ethernet device. Disabling IPv4 configuration in 'Network' fixed the issue. This may not work for everyone, as others may have a different underlying problem.\n", "Q: How can I see what photo the photos app is currently downloading from iCloud? I am trying to create a photo book in the new photos app, but it keeps hanging 'downloading photos from iCloud'. I see under preferences, it is downloading '1 item from iCloud', which appears to be stuck (I have left it for days). How can I see what photo is currently being downloaded so I can remove it form the project?\nSide-question, is there a way to tell if a photo is the 'full version' or the storage optimised version? (Apart from guessing by the file size)?\nThis is Photos v1.1 on OSX El Capitan (10.11), running on a 2011 MBA.\n\nA: Several things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open https://www.icloud.com/#photos and you can see / download the full resolution photo.\n\n*Then for the same photo - choose File -> Export -> Export Unmodified Original and compare the metadata and size difference between what came from your App and from the \"truth\" directly from the cloud. (Dragging or normal exports seem to be a different resolution than either the internal reduced version or the full, unmodified original in my experience.)\n\n\nAs to monitoring thing, that's easy too. Open the terminal app and use this command to monitor all cloud file operations up to and down from the cloud.\nbrctl log -w\n\nLike many terminal command line tools, you need to send the exit signal or close the window/app to get it to exit. Control and C is that command. Two follow on items, the Photos 1.1 is a bit better, so you might upgrade your OS and you can also pause the download if you wish in the iCloud preferences for Photos. It lets things stabilize so you can see what you have and not be testing as things change/download from the cloud.\n", "Q: Uninstalled CleanMyMac still shows notifications I had installed CleanMyMac before, and have already uninstalled it.\nHowever, I got the notification saying \"It's time to clean your mac\".\nHow is this possible and how can I avoid this?\n\n\nA: The interesting thing about uninstalling CleanMyMac is that the best application for the job is, in fact CleanMyMac.\nIf you set it to uninstall itself, it will tidily clean up its own leftovers before finally quitting & trashing itself.\nIt is, in fact, probably quicker to re-install it, then get it to uninstall itself than to pick apart where the leftovers are.\nRef: MacPaw FAQs\nHow To Uninstall CleanMyMac 2?  &\nHow to Uninstall CleanMyMac 3\n\nA: go to your command line, ~/Library/LaunchAgents and remove the .plist file reading cleanmymac\n\nA: Open System Preferences / Notifications / Scroll down till Clean My Mac is visible and uncheck all the boxes.

It consists of an SSD and a regular hard drive logically bundled together.\nDisk Utility detects the logical volume group of that constellation, which is named \"Macintosh HD\" and by default there is a partition underneath it with the same name.\nFor some reasons, this is not the case for you and I also see that the partition buttons are greyed out. So, my suggestion is to intentionally break the Fusion constellation apart and have Disk Utility fix it thereafter. Here is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Disk Utility\n\n*Open Terminal (menu \"Utilities\")\n\n*Type in diskutil coreStorage list and look for the UUID (you will need it in the next step)\n\n*Type in diskutil coreStorage delete lvgUUID|lvgName where lvgUUID|lvgName is the UUID you found before\n\n*Quit Terminal after the command finished\n\n*Open Disk Utility and follow the on-screen instructions to fix the \"damaged\" disk\n\n\nAfter that, you will be able to install OS X again.\n", "Q: Can I (or should I) use a MacBook charger on my iPhone? I recently got a MacBook with the USB-C charger. It comes with a 29-watt power brick, and I was wondering if I should use this to charge my iPhone. I've heard that the iPad power brick (I think 10 watts) charges the phone faster. I don't expect to be able to charge the phone proportionally faster, but would the MacBook brick damage the phone? I would rather only have to carry around one charging brick around campus. Also, I have a USB to USB-C converter.\n\nA: This video shows that you can use MacBook 12\" 29W USB-C Power Adapter with iPad and iPhone.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWzbaH24Q0Y\n\nA: Unless there is some reason to the contrary that I'm not aware of, yes, you can use your MacBook charger with your iPhone. The power adapter will only convert as much power as is drawn, and the iPhone will only draw as much power as it needs.\n(Note that it is not a good idea to charge your MacBook with an iPhone or iPad charger!)\n\nA: Yes, at least for the iPhone 6S using the Apple USB-C to Lighning 2m cable. I just started using it this week with mine and haven't had any issues. \nFor a few years I've charged my iPhone with an iPad charger. Not sure if the 29W charger is faster, but at least it seems just as fast.\nAlso, I heard in a podcast about videos warning about USB-C to USB converters. As long as you trust the one you have and it's not sketchy, I think it should be OK.\n\nA: My Macbook Pro 13inch Late 2016 61W USB-C Power brick says output: 20.3V/3A, 9V/3A or 5.2V/2.4A.\nSo yes you can charge your iphone with the Macbook charger.\nThe people at the Apple store just don't know what they are selling.\n\nA: Using a USB-C to USB-A adapter and a USB-A to Lighting cable to your MacBook charger means your iPhone gets no more power than using a common 12 watt USB-A charger, both cases means the phone sees 5 volts @ 2.4 amps.\nWith the MacBook 29 watt charger and a USB-C to Lightning cable the iPhone sees more power but Apple doesn't say how much more.  It's safe or Apple would not allow it.  I charge my iPhone from my 61 watt and 87 watt MacBook chargers regularly with nothing wrong that I can see.\nIf you wish to carry around just one charger then I would suggest getting something bigger to charge both.  With the phone plugged into the laptop, and the laptop plugged into the charger there's potential to charge both more quickly with a power powerful power supply.\nA quick look at the Apple store shows me that Apple discontinued all but three USB-C chargers, 30W, 61W, and 96W.  This makes a bit of sense because there's not much need to keep a 87 watt supply around when it's going to be about the same size, mass, and cost of their 96 watt supply.  It's really impossible to get a supply that's too big because the phone and laptop will take only so much power and a bigger supply isn't going to damage anything.  Too small though and you will be waiting for your devices to charge when you would not have to with a larger charger.\nWith a 30 watt charger being the default for either device it would seem logical that to charge both at the same time with their maximum charge rate it would take the 61 watt charger.  The MacBook will pass power just fine to the phone so both can charge quickly.  Charging either alone with the charger will be fine as well.\nIf a new charger is something that you might not see a need for at this time then that's fine, the charger you have will not overheat or anything.  The phone and laptop are smart enough to share the power and still charge, if just more slowly than with a larger charger.\n\nA: Yes you can. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208137\n\nYou can fast charge your iPhone 8 and later up to 50 percent battery in around 30 minutes.\nFast charging works when you use an Apple USB-C to Lightning cable and one of these adapters:\n\n*\n\n*Apple 18W, 20W, 29W, 30W, 61W, 87W, or 96W USB-C Power Adapter\n\n*A comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD)\n\n\n", "Q: Decrypt with FileVault I recently turned FileVault off because I really saw no need for it on my home computer (Mac Intel i5 16GB RAM w/Maverick).  However, I noticed when I tried running Mac Booster 3 (a cleanup/performance app), it took forever (9+ hrs) to run and I'm wondering if it's because the files are still encrypted?  Does turning FileVault off leave the files encrypted or not?\n\nA: No, your disk is decrypted when you turn off FileVault.\nFrom the Apple Knowledgebase:\n\nWhen you turn off FileVault, encryption is turned off and the contents of your disk are decrypted.

There seem to be multiple standards for image files representing the contents of a DVD.  For example, iDVD creates .img files if told to burn a file rather than a DVD directly.  However, Linux install disks (for example) that are too big to fit on one CD (over 740 Mb or so) usually come in the form of .iso files meant to be converted to a physical DVD using dd, Toast, Disk Utility, or a comparable program.  Disk Utility can also mount an .iso image on the desktop so that it looks like a drive, much as with .dmg files.  So, several related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly differentiates a DVD-size .iso from a DVD .img?\n\n*Is there a simple conversion path from .img to .iso?\n\n*Is .img an Apple-specific file format?\n\n*If .img is Apple-specific, should I be worried about archiving DVD images that I want to keep permanently as .imgs (i.e., is it possible that future software won't be able to read them)?\n\n\nThe last question speaks to the specific issue that brought this question to mind--I have a number of DVDs of home movies, painstakingly produced with iMovie and iDVD, that I would like to archive both as actual burnt video DVDs (i.e. for a DVD player) and as image files from which I can burn more copies if necessary.  But is .img the best format to do this, or are those likely to become obsolete?  Would .iso be better?  I'm interested in the general question of .iso vs .img (vs any other relevant formats) too, as the title of the question indicates.\n\nA: Single-track (.iso) vs. multiple-track (.img)\n\nAny single-track CD-ROM, DVD or Blu-ray disc can be archived in ISO\n  format as a true digital copy of the original.\nBut ISO files have limitations. For example, a CD can have multiple\n  tracks, which can contain computer data, audio, or video. File systems\n  such as ISO 9660 are stored inside one of these tracks. Since ISO\n  images are expected to contain a binary copy of the file system and\n  its contents, there is no concept of a \"track\" inside an ISO image,\n  since a track is a container for the contents of an ISO image. This\n  means that CDs with multiple tracks can't be stored inside a single\n  ISO image; at most, an ISO image will contain the data inside one of\n  those multiple tracks, and only if it is stored inside a standard file\n  system.\nFormats such as CUE/BIN, CCD/IMG and MDS/MDF formats can be used to\n  store multi-track disc images, including CD-Audio discs. These formats\n  store a raw disc image of the complete disc, including information\n  from all tracks, along with a companion file describing the multiple\n  tracks and the characteristics of each of those tracks. This would\n  allow an optical media burning tool to have all the information\n  required to correctly burn the image on a new disc.\n\nShamelessly copied (an slightly edited) from wiki/ISO_image (24-10-2015).\n", "Q: iPhone photo recovery I transferred my photos to the stream and they were all there, I went back recently and noticed a section was deleted, is there any way possible for me to recover those photos?\n\nA: Check to see if they are in the recently deleted album. \n", "Q: Can a website on safari give you a virus? I was browsing around on good ol' Sarari when all of a sudden, when I tapped on a website that I had successfully visited before, I was redirected to a site simply called Addware Detected !! On screen a notification popped up telling me that Addware/spyware may be on my iPad (2). It give a list of effects that it may have and tells me to contact IOS Tech support and list a number. There is a \"ok\" button at the bottom of the pop up but when ever I tap it it just comes back up and I cannot change tabs or open the history or anything. I had to download the Google app just to post this. Now what I want to know is is this real? And should I contact the number?\n\nA: Do not contact the number it is a scam.\nThis is my advice from several sites including an Apple support document Note the document covers both OS X and iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.\nOn iOS this is just a javascript pop up which just affects the page you are on and is just a message. To get rid of it close the browser,  iOS 9 might then prompt you with a Block Alerts button, if so tap the button to stop showing alerts from that webpage.\nIf you can't close the page then force quit the browser and don't go back to that page.\nThe writer of the script wants you to ring and the discussion will include asking you for money, it is a scam.\n\nA: As Mark stated, whatever you do, don't contact the number. It's definitely a scam.\nIf your iPad is running iOS 9, you can use a content blocker with Safari. I use one called \"Lionz\", it's not perfect, but it's free and works well enough. When configured correctly, it should block the pop-up after the webpage is reloaded again and you should be able to leave the webpage.\nLikely, your iPad doesn't have a virus. Unjailbroken iOS viruses are almost unheard of. It's probably a part of the webpage itself and you shouldn't have anything else to worry about. Just remember to update to the latest version of iOS (9.1 was released a few days ago) for the best security and report the scam to Apple.\n", "Q: Where is load presets option in Terminal preferences?

The folder PhotoStreamsData contains the same photos as the DCIM folder, only with a slightly lower resolution. Why create (almost exact) duplicates? Is it only to save some space on iCloud? Can I safely delete it to free up some space? Would deletion make any difference to the iCloud sync?\n(iOS 9.0.2, iPhone 5c)\n\nA: In general, deleting files that an application stores internally is a bad idea. This goes double for iOS since the presumption that users won't be idly deleting things is more realistic across the user-population of an app. The reasons for not deleting things are:\n\n\n*\n\n*the app (or the system) has a database for tracking what's placed where. Deleting the file without cleaning up the reference at best means you end up with another file. At worst, you have crashes and slowdowns caused by the app/system having to sanity check all the files it has placed on the storage.\n\n*the files will appear again as the app re-does the work you've undone.\n\n\nThe reasons to place files in different spaces allows the system to reclaim storage space in the even that a cached file can be cleared to make way for other content. It also is baked in to how Photos works - when you run low on storage space, the app can be more aggressive about compressing the local cached copy of the photo. One setting won't be appropriate for people with 128 GB of storage and 16 GB of storage not to mention as you fill up your storage with other items over time. Also, I bet Apple is only backing up the files that are \"authoritative\" and not thumbnail or resampled versions of the iCloud originals. That saves bandwidth if backing up to the cloud and storage space on the backup and time to complete a backup.\nSo, I'd recommend making other changes like deleting large apps, large video files and let Photos be photos with storing multiple copies of images and multiple resolutions in different places.\nYour DCIM folder is where the photos taken on that device live - so use care not to delete the authoritative copy of a file until it's backed up elsewhere.\n", "Q: Do I have to turn on find my Mac on my computer?

Can't retrieve old hotmail Apple Id account because it doesn't exist anymore rightly so.\n\nA: The ID still exists, & in fact cannot be deleted - Apple apparently keep them 'forever'. \nWhat you can do is change the primary email address attached to the ID - the ID itself doesn't need to be a valid email address, it's merely a sensible starting point.\n\nChange your Apple ID \nLearn how to change the email address that you use as your Apple ID.\nIn most cases, your Apple ID is also the primary email address of your Apple ID account. You can change your Apple ID to any other email address you control, as long as it's not already in use as an Apple ID. If your email address ends with @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com, it's already an Apple ID. \nUse these steps to reset your Apple ID:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Sign out of iCloud, the iTunes Store, App Store, FaceTime, Find My Friends, Find My iPhone, and iMessage on each device that uses your current Apple ID for these services.\n  1.Go to My Apple ID.\n  \n*Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in. Forgot your password?\n  \n*Select Edit next to Apple ID and Primary Email Address.\n  \n*Enter the email address that you want to use as your Apple ID, then select Save Changes. Apple will send a verification email to that address.\n  \n*Open the email from Apple, then click Verify Now. Didn't receive the email?\n  \n*When the My Apple ID page opens, sign in with your new Apple ID email address and password. When you see a message that verification is complete, you can start using your updated Apple ID.\n  \n*Update the features and services that you use with Apple ID, so that each one is using your updated Apple ID.\n  \n  \n  If you need to change the Apple ID that's signed in to your iOS device, use these steps to sign out, then back in with a different Apple ID.\n\nRef: Apple KB - Change your Apple ID\n", "Q: Asset Management, Zip Application with File previews? I have large amounts of design asset files I have created and purchased (images, PSDs, icons, fonts, etc...)  These are really starting to take up a lot of space.  \nI would like to zip the files into an archive, but still have the ability to browse the files as I'm doing design work.\nAre there an Mac zip utilities that would allow me to browse a zip file \"in place\" where I could see what the file content's look like without manually unzipping the file every time as this would be impractical?\n\nA: BetterZip is fairly comprehensive & has a preview mode, which can be toggled from prefs as to whether it will uncompress or open to preview by default. It also has a Quick Look plugin, which remains free even after the trial period.\nZipster tries to go one better by integrating zip files into the system so you browse them just like folders & can add/remove files without appearing to do anything other than drop/remove a file in a folder. \nOverall, BetterZip is the more comprehensive tool… but Zipster is free, vs 20 bucks for BetterZip.\n\nA: i'm using winzip mac and double click doesn't mean unzip it\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut (App Shortcut) taken?

I checked all the other item above \"App Shortcuts\", i.e. \"Accessibility\", \"Spotlight\", ...\nHow can I check which app is using it and how can I force the system to use my shortcut?\n\nA: just a guess… but sounds like something might have a custom map to \"Undo\" because Cmd/z & Cmd/shift/Y are alternates for Undo. \nFor it to be auto-replacing inside system prefs would make me think it is not a system key command, but a third party, Karabiner, TypeIt4Me etc\n", "Q: iPhone 6 contacts appearing that I don't know I have contacts appearing in my iPhone that I didn't put there and don't know. How is this happening?\n\nA: Possibly you have a service enabled on your iPhone which adds another set of contacts. (It might be Facebook contacts or whatever else.) \nCheck the Groups in Contacts and try switching the different groups off to see which one's adding the contacts you're seeing. Once you know which group is responsible for that, you can clean that up. \n\nA: Are you sharing your Apple ID account login information?

This is driving up my data usage. How do I make the iPad forget the Personal Hotspot? I have already factory defaulted the Network Settings but it appears anyway. I have also changed the Personal Hotspot password on the iPhone and it connects anyway.\n\nA: On the iPad, in Settings > Wifi, tap the 'i' in a circle icon next to the listing for the Personal Hotspot, then tap the Forget This Network tab.\nYou should make absolutely sure the Personal Hotspot is turned off. Looking at Settings > Personal Hotspot, it is pretty unambiguous.\nYou should also check to see if Instant Hotspot has been enabled:\n\nInstant hotspot\nYou can use Personal Hotspot on your iPhone to provide Internet access to your other devices without additional setup.

At the moment I am using an external drive and I am managing. The only problem is that if I move the screen or remove a USB drive from a port next to the one being used by the external hard disk I risk unplugging the external drive. Is there a form of accessory I can buy to help prevent such a thing? Do you have any other setup in mind that might be more stable?\n\nA: Connect a USB hub and the boot drive only to the Mac and then use whatever caution, tape, cardboard enclosure to ensure you don't \"accidentally\" reach to the protected area.\nAll your plugging and unplugging of USB devices can happen on the hub - physically away from the iMac.\nIf you're unable to get a long enough cord for the USB drive, mount it physically to the back of the Mac with double sided tape, screws, permanent adhesive to make a shelf - whatever you feel will provide you with realistic enough protection. With a routine backup, you'll not lose data and you'll only lose time if you can't engineer a decent enough setup.\n", "Q: Turn off Aliases in iCloud Drive When I browse into an iCloud Drive folder (specifically Preview.app's folder) via Finder on OS X 10.11.1, I see both the files I knowingly placed there and the ones I opened with the related app, Preview in this example, which got automatically aliased in there.\nTo me, it's just clutter, useless. I'm thinking perhaps a workaround script or toll running periodically as a cron jobs could wipe out the aliases in the specified locations?\nIs there a (hidden/unofficial)way to turn-off this behaviour of iCloud Drive that it doesn't create aliases? If not, has anyone a tool/script that would be the start of something I could adopt to clean the folders?\n\nA: I would advise against deleting the aliases since the design is to place them there. Since the entire cloud folder is synchronized you're fighting a losing battle when those aliases come back from the cloud or from the process that creates them. As a bonus, you already have one copy of those files stored elsewhere in iCloud drive, so perhaps you could make progress by moving the file so that it lives in preview rather than the other folder.\nIf you look in terminal - you will see that all the .alias files are hidden with a . to start the name and you could easily script deletion of these files with AppleScript, Automator, Hazel, cron with something as blunt as \nrm ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/.[ABCDEF0123456789]*\\.alias\n\nI've tested that while looking at brctl log -w on OS X 10.11.1 (15B42) and the system seems to not misbehave and propagated the deletion up to the cloud properly, but I can't say I'd be comfortable with automating the deletion to run continuously or even regularly.\n", "Q: Moving data from Mid-2010 iMac to Late 2015 iMac I just ordered a new 27\" Late 2015 iMac.

It'll be faster than wireless, but I suspect still pretty slow.\n\nA: Wired ethernet (gigabit on both ends) will be every bit as fast as Firewire to Thunderbolt and without the cost of the adapter.\nDepending on how noisy your Wireless environment is, you might have a limiting factor in the speed of the old iMac hard drive that's lower than WiFi throughput, but wired ethernet is so much more reliable, I'd do that if you can.\nIf you decide to try a wireless set up, use the fast new Mac to create a WiFi network and join the old iMac so that all the radio speed is dedicated to the transfer if you wanted to go that way with more than 10 GB of files to transfer (presumably).\n", "Q: Cannot change permissions on com.apple.Boot.plist I am trying to set the permissions on the Boot.plist file (Located in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration) and it won't let me. I have clicked the lock and entered my password in Finder, and when I try to edit the permissions it says that I don't have the necessary permissions. When I try to do it with sudo chmod, it says that I can't change the file permissions. (I can use sudo just fine) I've also tried using sudo vi and it won't let me save it. I have tried using first aid too. I am running El Capitan on a Macbook Pro Retina 13 inch early 2013.\n\nA: You're running into System Integrity Protection (SIP) that prevents modification of various system files and directories when it is enabled (which by default it is in El Capitan (OSX 10.11). It is meant to provide more security from malware that attempts to modify the system for its own uses.\nSIP can be disabled if need be and disabling it would allow changes to be made to the files and directories that are normally protected by SIP. Since Apple intends for these protected items to not be modified by anyone other than Apple (or other validated signers approved by Apple for particular software produced by them) I have my doubts about whether, once the permissions were modified, SIP could be reenabled without disabling execution of the machine (disabled \"temporarily\" by software, not by permanently disabling the hardware). So it comes down to weighing whether one wants to disable SIP to make certain modifications that could not be made otherwise or decide that those modifications are not important enough to disable SIP's protections. (One reason one may want to disable SIP would be to allow certain programs to run on the machine that will not run with SIP enabled.) I could be wrong here but I believe that disabling SIP's protections would reduce security no more than if one stuck with Yosemite (OSX 10.10) which doesn't have SIP enabled as fully as El Capitan. Also, Apple provides a warning that if SIP is disabled you will be running an unsupported configuration that is likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.\nSo the first part is determining whether to disable or enable SIP based on your own situation and considering the various pros and cons. If one decides to disable SIP it can only be done in the Recovery console (that's not quite true but in general it is; there are other ways for machines that can't be booted into the Recovery console). The steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the machine and boot into the Recovery Console which is done by holding the Command and R keys down when restarting. (I'd like to add that if you didn't know how to get into the Recovery console then you probably shouldn't be doing this anyway.)\n\n*Open the Terminal Program by selecting Terminal in the Utilities menu.\n\n*Within Terminal enter the line\ncsrutil disable\n\n\n*Reboot the machine either by restarting from the Apple Menu or by entering the following command in Terminal:\nreboot\n\n\n*After rebooting the machine you can check to see if SIP is disabled by invoking Terminal and entering:\ncsrutil status\n\nwhich should display the following:\n\nSystem Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).  \n\nConfiguration:  \n   Apple Internal: disabled  \n   Kext Signing: disabled  \n   Filesystem Protections: disabled  \n   Debugging Restrictions: disabled  \n   DTrace Restrictions: disabled  \n   NVRAM Protections: disabled  \n\nThis is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the \nfuture and leave your machine in an unknown state.\n\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't boot I have a Macbook Pro 8.2, Intel i7, 4 GB of RAM and 500 GB HDD.\nWhile working with some apps open in background, the screen suddenly went blank and music looped.

Then the display will sudenly blank (white or black), then showing up with horizontal lines like old TV. After that happen for minutes or less, then system freeze (All you gonna do is force shutdown). Boot up the MBP with blank grey or system load on half or 3/4. This is permanent failure with different restart procedures, and each case write bellow:\nNormal startup: Your computer will boot, show the Apple logo and pinwheel, stuck on half way or 3/4 of system progress, and then go to a white/grayish screen and remain there (no warning text, just a plain/blank). You must force reboot (hold the power button down, again).\n\n\n*\n\n*Safe mode startup: While booting the computer hold the Shift key\nuntil you see the Apple logo and system progress.

Whats the deal? I've synced my phone to my computer and the iTunes program says I have 1.6 gigs free. Is my phone just displaying incorrectly? \n\nA: iOS is keeping you safe by saving all deleted videos and photos in a special album called Recently Deleted.

On the iPhone \"Cellular\" settings screen, you can choose which apps are allowed to use cellular data and which can only communicate over wi-fi. In iOS 9, Apple introduced Wi-Fi Assist which automatically switches to cellular data when a wi-fi connection is present, but not functioning well. Can anyone confirm that the iPhone will respect the cellular data use settings when in wi-fi assist mode? \nExample scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the settings, I specify that Tinder isn't allowed to use cellular data. \n\n*I am browsing Tinder on wi-fi\n\n*The wi-fi connection becomes unreliable and Wi-Fi Assist kicks in\n\n*Will my phone now use cellular data for Tinder, since it's pretending that it's still on wi-fi? Or will it apply the cellular data rules and not use Wi-Fi Assist with this specific app?\n\n\nA: I have tested this with my own app and home server (plus my horrid internet at one part of my house). I created an application that sends an HTTP request to the server when you press a button and an application on my server that makes a sound when it receives it and records the IP address.\nWhen the app was allowed to use cellular data, it went through quickly and had an external IP (confirming the request went through cellular).\nWhen it was not allowed to use cellular data, it tried to use Wi-Fi and eventually did send the request (after some time), using a local IP address.\nSo Wi-Fi assist does respect the rules that you have set in your phone's settings.\n", "Q: My iPhone isn't playing WhatsApp videos sent from an android device through WhatsApp I have an iPhone 5s and it isn't playing videos sent to me on WhatsApp, the sender is a Samsung user so maybe that's why?

We then removed me from the Stream to re-add. When we tried, I do not receive the invite. We tried my phone number and Apple ID. When I send the same person an invite to a \"test\" stream, they get the invitation right away. \nI have other photo streams with other people and have not ran into any issues, just with this one person. They are able to send invites to other people for other albums as well. I am on iOS 9, they're on 8 but we had this issue when we were both on 8 as well. \nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nA: The person who can't send the invite should check if mobile data is enabled for photos app\nMaybe when they sent the invite to you, they didn't have wifi and mobile data was disabled.  but had wifi when they sent one to another person. \nIt happened to me. I couldn't receive and send invites. Once mobile data is enabled, the notification appeared that someone invited me and asked if I want to join.

I set it up using Airport Utility to extend the network, and that seems good so far.  It's connecting wirelessly, for now, which I'm comfortable with (not concerned with actual downstream speed, at the moment).\nUnfortunately, the Airport Express seems to have picked a poor channel.  I used NetSpot to see how its coverage was, and the answer was more-or-less terrible: while the Time Capsule still is in the green-ish (~40-50 db) range even in the 'poor' areas, the Airport Express is twenty feet away and still no better than that.\nI notice from the channels that the Express is on the very overused near me Channel 11, while the main Time Capsule is on Channel 1 (both for 2.5Ghz, which is the one I'd expect it to mostly use).  Is there a way to change that?  I go into Airport Utility, and I can change the channel the Time Capsule is using (under Wireless Options), but that setting isn't there for the Airport Express.  My understanding of how a Wi-Fi Extender should work is that it should not use the same channel; so I don't see why Apple would force this to automatic.  Is it so (forced) or is there a way to work around this?  (Also, the 5Ghz channel is identical for both devices, which again I'd think is bad.)\nI have both Mac and Windows computers available, if that's relevant.\n\nA: You've identified the big problem with WiFi backhaul. You have to have both radios on the same channel and half the time the radios are sending traffic between each other and the other half talking to clients.\nSince wifi is half duplex and everyone has to wait for the last person to finish talking before the next can speak - you run into serious limitation once you're at the 10 to 30 client number.\nFor almost all cases where you want channel diversity - run a wire so that your backhaul is over power line / ethernet / coax cable - anything but WiFi will make your network so much faster and easier to manage.\nFor corporate settings, you almost need a third radio dedicated to the backhaul to make most mesh networks work best or bite the bullet and run wired backhaul there as well. Normally power over ethernet means wired backhaul is doable for large deployments as well as for small home / office situations.\n\nA: This may or may not help you but I have managed to get my airport express to repeat on a different 2.4 channel (not 5) from my airport extreme base station.\nMake sure in your base station you have set your channels manually. Set channel 1 and 48 for example. Restart the base station. \nAccess your airport express configuration and set it to create a network. Then do the same, but in this case you could set for example 6 and 44. The 44 is really there just for shits and giggles, it will probably just extend your 5ghz on whatever channel the base station uses. Save the configuration, wait for restart, confirm the airport express is transmitting on the channels you manually set. Then go back into config, and choose to extend your 2.4 network and then choose the option to extend your 5ghz network when prompted if you have it set to a different name (which you should.)\nWhat you should see is your express transmitting now on channel 6 and your capsule on channel 1, and both devices sharing the same 5ghz channel.\n", "Q: Mac restarts again and again I have a huge problem with my iMac. When I boot it, I hear the \"start sound\", I see the Apple icon and a charging circle. After 2-3 minutes the Mac reboots, black screen then the start sound and then the Apple icon again. \nI tried (cmdR) to repair some system files but it doesn't work. When I boot to Single User Mode I see some output and everything looks okay, but after 15 sec of computing, I see this: \n\"syncing disks, killing all process\" and directly after that the Mac reboots.\nI don't care if I have to reformat everything even if I loose all my data.\nSomeone has a solution to repair or to reformat the internal HDD?\nWhat I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM (altcmdPR), but no change.\n\n*Unplug and push the power button during 30 sec but no change\n\n*Trying to to boot to Recovery Mode (cmdR) which doesn't work.\n\n\nA: Rather than ask for lots of details here is your guide for quick hardware triage.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the Mac for literally 5 minutes (go make tea or get a paper/pencil to make notes and a clock with second hands).\n\n*Power on the Mac holding the option key - once the screen goes grey - note what happens after 60 seconds. Wait another 60 and then power it off.\n\n*Power it on and hold Command R. Be prepared for images showing it trying to connect to a network. Make note of what you see and when the screen changes.\n\n*Wait up to 10 minutes for a Recovery HD to show up. At this point, you can run Disk Utility and note anything it marks as wrong.\n\n\nAt this point, you will have enough data to ask a follow on question and/or search this site or Apple.com/support for how to diagnose a startup issue.\nAlso, make note of wall clock times. You will now know how long the machine can run a clean OS (the recovery HD) without restarting itself. That will be useful in comparing how fast it restarts to the old OS or a new OS if you choose to reinstall Mac OS to see if that's the cause of the restarts.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan & Android Studio 1.4 Has anyone else noticed the following with Android Studio 1.4 running on OS X El Capitan?\nI can't remember the exact point when I lost the ability to build an Android app from the IDE due to the fact that the extensive set of custom pre build steps that I have failed to run. Those custom steps run a Python-script, and the main problem is that gradle doesn't seem to find the Python-binary due to the fact that the PATH environment variable is the extremely sparse list of /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin.\nHere are some random points related to finding this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*This problem does not affect building from the terminal.\n\n*This problem is specific to OS X, none of my Linux boxes suffer from this, nor my colleague's Windows machine suffer from this.\n\n*This is specifically about having PATH set properly.\n\n\nWhat I've tried this far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Editing /etc/paths: nope, no help.\n\n*Various ~/Library/LaunchAgent -tips found from the net. Y'know those launchctl setenv PATH ...? No help.\n\n\nA: After further work on this, I found something that seems to work. I RTM'ed the man page of launchctl, and noticed the config-subcommand. So this is what I did:\nsudo launchctl config user path \"paths:I:want:GUI:apps:to:use\"\n\nThen reboot, as launchctl instructed me to do.\nI had added a debug print statement to my gradle file:\nprintln System.getenv(\"PATH\")\n\nAfter rebooting, build printed out the changed PATH including those parts that I added via config user path.\n", "Q: Keynote 6.6 cannot open old file, says: \" cannot be opened for some reason.\" I've found that Keynote after upgrading to 6.6 could not open some of my previously created presentations anymore. How do I revert to a previous version?\n\nA: Apple released Keynote 6.6.1 today - I tried to open previous files before and after updating, and sure enough, the files that previously would not open in 6.6 actually opened in 6.6.1. \n\nA: I have found that reverting to 5.5.3 solves the issue. I can now open my old presentation again. \nThere are two ways you can do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use time machine: Use that to find the old Keynote.app file (~550Mb) and restore it \n\n*If you don't have a backup of your own.. Find a torrent for Keynote 6.5.3. The version I found there works for me. You'll want to delete or compress and set aside the faulty 6.6. version before you put the old version in your applications folder.\n\n\nA: I had same issue! Downloaded keynote to find it would not open. Could not upgrade to 6.6 on Yosemite. It could be read in Preview so was able to rebuild - not ideal but quicker than uploading to ElCapt with poor wifi connection and limited time.\n", "Q: Boot from USB in macbook pro mid 2012 I have removed everything from my macbook pro. Now, how can choose USB as a startup disk? I tried using option \"SHIFT\" keys also cmd+R. Nothing is working. How can I solve it? I am using Mid 2012 Macbook Pro and that usb is Ubuntu installer. [Btw, I am not interested to install Ubuntu in mac.]\n\nA: The 'option' key at startup will give you the option of selecting another startup disk. The problem may be that your USB stick is not considered a valid startup option.\n\nA: Are you able to test if it boots from any other USB bootable source? To test if it's your mac or your Ubuntu installer that is the problem.\n", "Q: OS X - Signing installer/application I would like to sign my OS X installer using company certificate. I have .cer and .p12 files. I wonder if there is some way to do that without creating keychain. E.g. in 'productsign' tool flag --cert looks promising, but I can't find too much info about how to use it.  \n\nA: Apple's signing tools require a keychain containing your organisation's signing identity.\nThe cert flag on productsign is used to embed an intermediate certificate. It is not used to specify the signing certificate.\nIt is possible to create a keychain containing your organisation's signing identity. This can then be used to sign your installer using the keychain flag. The separate keychain file can be managed with source code control or other file management tools; it remains separate from the user's login keychain.\n", "Q: Using wrong character set I have an old text file from an old Mac, and I'm pretty sure I'm using the wrong character set.  Opening quotes show up as Ò, closing quote as Ó, and apostrophes show up as Õ.

A Google search came up with other key codes such as 127.\nThings to Fix my solution\nWhat is the correct Key Code? Is there a way to find it out yourself like Accessibility Inspector for buttons, fields etc. I tried recording, doesn't work? Does Apple have a official list a of Key Codes?\nFor those interested, below is the script, nothing fancy:\n# Checks and remove .png if exists\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set oldClipboard to the clipboard\n    \n    repeat 4 times\n        key code 123 using {shift down}  # Left Arrow key.

Can easily test it in TextEdit to see that. When I said add in dialog boxes to text the flow, mostly what you need to test is that the \"if newClipboard is equal to \".png\" is getting triggered (not if the text is getting selected.\nI would guess that your problem is that in a web form box (which I think you were describing), javascript is slowing down the text response including the copying to clipboard. It is a VERY common problem when scripting copying to clipboard that you need to add a delay after copying in order for the process to complete before the script proceeds. Try this, which simply adds the delay:\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\ndelay 1\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set oldClipboard to the clipboard\n    repeat 4 times\n        key code 123 using {shift down} # Left Arrow key.

Combinations of Text Boxes and Line graphics layered and arranged, should achieve the desired result.  Determine beforehand if the graphic and text box should cause wrapping and/or move with the rest of the text in the document or remain static.\nCreate a Horizontal Rule with Text Centered\n\n*\n\n*Add a Line graphic to the canvas (Just one line will do)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Position the line horizontally to the desired width\n\n*Set the Object Placement properties in the Arrange tab on the Inspector as desired.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a Text Box setting the Text style Alignment properties to Center and Middle\n\n\n\n*\n\n*IMPORTANT: Change the background color from None to a color matching your document's background.  (White typically)\n\n*Set the Object Placement properties as desired\n\n*Position the text box over the line.  Use the alignment guides to center on the page\n\n\nBy using layers, one can create many interesting effects.  Some of them can be explored by examining the built in templates.\n\nA: ———————————————————————Now is the time——————————————\nI don't know if it helps, I use Pages quite a lot, and when I run into layout problems I tend to resort to a Text Box. Then place/extend the box to whatever I require.\nUse the Arrange function, Object placement, \"Stay on Page\". Text Wrap, \"None\", Allowing me to move the box to required location. Also with the facility of moving the box, close to or over any other object or typing.\n", "Q: Shutdown Cause -128 My Macbook pro (early 2011, upgraded to 10.11) started behaving strangely lately. It started randomly crashing multiple times of the day, and the only information I've been able to find is the following message in the logs.\nOct 26 10:07:01 localhost kernel[0]: Previous shutdown cause: -128\nAny idea what might have caused it? I've looked up the cause code, but it didn't provide me any additionl information and I couldn't find anything online.\nEdit: I did two memtest runs and they both returned no errors on the memory. I've also tried swapping the memory banks around without any improvement.\nAHT same thing, doesn't find any error.\n\nA: Please make sure you also check your Macbook for excessive dust inside! \nI have a Macbook pro which shutdown randomly (and gave the shutdown cause -128 error). When I cleaned the build up dust it started functioning normally again!\nI just removed the backplate and used a can of compressed air to clean it. Check https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Mac_Laptop to see how you can remove the backplate of your model.\nPS: Try not to touch any parts inside, because of static discharge\n\nA: Check your memory.\nFrom Apple Support Communities\nThere is also a really good procedure for testing hardware and software of your Mac on Apple's Support site  https://support.apple.com/en-us/ts3742\n\nA: The shutdown cause -128 is related to the hardware issues. For example it may be related to RAM, although some people suggest that it can be also related to battery time span (it surpassed the end of its life), so basically it tells you that you shouldn't re-cell this battery due to proprietary circuitry that protects the battery. Therefore you should try to plug in your Mac into a power source and check whether it helps. Then install Coconut Battery app to find out the state of your battery, if it's fine, then it could be some issue with your logic board.\nKeep in mind that -128 code is a general unknown hardware error (\"catch all\" code), so it can be anything else. So in general you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC and Reset NVRAM (which you did).\n\n*Run an Apple Hardware Test.\n\n*Log a kernel panic.\n\n*Install EtreCheck app to find serious problems on your Mac.\n\n*Monitor whether your laptop is not overheating (e.g. using iStat Menus).\n\n\nSee also: Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?\n\nA: Mine has been with Apple for a couple of weeks now, with this problem.  They've reproduced it with a full rebuild of the software from scratch, so at least they now acknowledge it wasn't anything I was running and is hardware related.\nThey're suggesting most likely a logic board to correct the problem.  $750 Canadian.  Not sure I'm going to shell out that much on my mid-2014 MacBook Pro 15\" but I'm plenty pissed about it.\n\nA: Shutdown cause -128 is an unknown shutdown cause. That means the system doesn't know what's the reason why the computer shutdown.\nThe hardware did suffer a low voltage event or crash that isn’t common enough (or there aren’t sensors to record this as it goes down like a black box) and the software didn’t have a chance to shut things down so consider hardware service if you can’t resolve with with a clean erase / install.\n", "Q: Open Text File From Finder In Vim I do a lot of programming and just starting to do a bit of web development.

I plan to create an app that connects an iphone with another device like a second iphone or a laptop. The problem with my app is that it will transfer data to and from these two connected devices. Some of the data that comes from the laptop will go to the internet and vice versa.\nHowever all the data that is being transferred is very specific to the application. So the user can't simply use my app to surf the net and watch netflix. It's all restricted to the data from my application. \nIs this considered tethering? I have seen on many occasions tethering apps being pulled or rejected from the app store and I don't want that to happen to my app after spending a lot of effort developing it. \n\nA: Apple implements tethering, so if your app proxies TCP/IP traffic directly, you will probably run afoul of several aspects of the review process.\nClearly, if your app is doing things to add value to the network you'll likely have more legs to stand on that your app isn't just the same implementation as carrier tethering:\n\n\n*\n\n*linking IOT type devices\n\n*speak protocols other than just TCP/IP\n\n*allow filtering, reporting, proxy, QOS controls\n\n\nLike all app submissions, your milage may vary.

I'm trying to record both what's happening on screen and the audio being played by the applications. To my surprise, QuickTime did not record the sound. I believe it worked before in previous OS X releases, but that is not something that I use often so I have not bothered to try earlier.\nWhat is the current situation on El Capitan ? Have I messed with something that prevents QuickTime from capturing the sound, or has it never worked ?\nHere is my view of Quick Time  / New Screen Recording on a Mac Mini:\n\nOn my Macbook Pro, I have the option select None or Internal Microphone. Internal microphone actually records the speakers of the Mac Book as heard from its own microphone, which obviously sounds terrible.\nThis is a MacMini 7,1 (late 2014) and there is nothing in Input Sources.\n\nA: When you are in the recording screen window, at the right of the red button you must see an arrow, click on it and you should see the audio input dialog. Tested now with OS X 10.11.1\n\nA: Of course you can use QuickTime to record both screen with audio, and you need to install a virtual sound card like soundflower to capture computer sound. Besides, you can also try to use screen recorders like ShowMore (free screen recorder for Windows and Mac), Jing (5 minutes' recording limitation) and many more to do the recording.\n\nA: For those who aren't finding Soundflower in the AppStore, tracking down the correct downloads for this semi-dead project can be kind of tricky.\nI installed the Kernel Extension from here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases\n(Note that to follow the instructions for Audio MIDI Setup, I Had to choose Window > Audio Setup)\nThen I installed SoundFlowerBed from this fork: https://github.com/mLupine/SoundflowerBed/releases\nThat puts an item in the menu that allows you to set SoundFlower (2ch) --> Built-In Output, which then makes \"SoundFlower\" available in QuickTime Player etc.\n\nA: Don't bother with installing software or extensions.\nYou just need an \"aux cable\" (which has stereo 3.5mm headphone plug, male at both ends).  Any length will do.  \n\nPlug one end into the headphone jack and the other end into the mic jack.\nIf your system doesn't have a mic jack, you can use any USB-to-audio input device you please; most automatically recognize on the Mac. \n\nA: I started using Voila-->Capto. Costs money but works well and even has a feature to stop recording after a set time and other features. \nhttp://www.globaldelight.com/capto/\n\nA: Use Background Music.\nTo install, either:\n\n*\n\n*brew install --cask background-music\n\n\n*Or go to https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic and install the .pkg file.\nNow, in Quicktime Screen Recording, you will see an option for Microphone for \"Background Music\". Select \"Background Music\". Then when you do the screen recording, it will record the System Audio.\n\n\nA: For those wanting to record their voice or the sounds coming from the speakers...\nNo extra software is required.\nYou just need to click the little arrow to the right of the record button and change it from None to Internal Microphone.\nNot sure why this is defaulted to None but I was caught by surprise when I changed from an old Macbook to a new one with a fresh OS install.\nAlthough it's not an ideal answer to the OP's desires, I'm leaving this answer here because it answers the question in the title.\n\nA: You  need to install Soundflower in order to run it on El Capitan. El Capitan requires kext to be signed in order to load them. This one gets its kext installed in /Library/Extensions/.\nThis is due to System Integrity Protection\nThen, you have to create a multi-output device with: Audio MIDI Setup.app, which is found in /Applications/Utilities/ :\n\nFinally, when you want to do the actual recording, make sure you use this multi-output device, and capture from the same Soundflower device used in this multi-output device. Otherwise, you can't both listen to and capture the sound, because it goes directly to soundflower without being copied to the built-in output.\nalt/option + right clicking on volume gives you this menu:\n\nand Quicktime now looks like this:\n\n\nA: For everyone arriving here from a google search in 2020 with Catalina, trying to record from the internal microphone without success...go to Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Microphone and make sure QuickTime Player is checked.\n\n\nA: You can also use SoundFlower for this. In a way, it acts like a microphone, which makes it possible to select it as an audio source in Quicktime.\n\nA: If you want to record the audio generated by your running applications etc. you will need to use SoundFlower or something similar. It's available free from the AppStore.\nIf your internal microphone is glitching out and you just want the system to recognise the hardwares presence again; try simply plugging some headphones or something into your 3.5mm TRRS audio jack.\nI had the same problem the other day and thought the actual soundcard was fried but just making that quick contact brought it straight back online.\n", "Q: Backup files from corrupt disk to usb drive in single user mode I try to backup my files of a corrupt system. I can start into the single user mode and want so store my home folder to my backup system. To mount my usb drive I need to mount the root disk as writeable.

What am I doing wrong?\nThanks\n\nA: Single user mode is the wrong tool for this job.   Connect an external drive if you want to use one and then restart in to Recovery HD ( or Internet recovery).\nUse the terminal application from there to make your copies and backups. It's handles mounting all the filesystems properly so you can move things around. \n", "Q: How to update OS X in single user mode? I would like to know how to update from 10.10.0 to 10.10.5 just by using single user mode.\nIs this possible and if so how would you go about doing so.\nWhy would I do this?...\nLinked to my other question I was interested if updating in single user mode would make it faster and more secure.\nHope the question makes sense\n\nSingle user mode can be easily accessed by holding command + S\n\nA: Single user mode disables many of the system demons and processes needed to run an update.\nInstead of that, I use the createistallmedia tool to make a bootable installer on a USB drive and I boot to that OS  that is exceptionally limited and controlled by Apple and exists only to run the installer.\nThe downside of this method is that you need apple to release an installer based on 10.10.5  and it's also a bit of chicken and egg problem if you start asking which operating system do you trust to create the installer in the first place. \nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260 for details on which build corresponds to which numbered release.\n\nA: This article explains how to use the command line softwareupdate tool to perform updates: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200113.\nI tested it on my system and it appears to work as a local user as long as you have sudo access to your system.\n", "Q: Run Windows 10 on Mac from custom boot drive? My Mac has specs for Fallout 4, but it won't run with wine like the others. I don't want Windows directly installed on my Mac because it corrupted my hard drive last time, instead I want to install it on a USB 3.0/Thunderbolt drive, where I can hold down a key while booting up my Mac with it plugged in to boot Windows 10. Or something like that. What I have is a Mac with Yosemite and a Windows 10 disk, I need to get an external drive capable of this $30-$50 preferably and suggestions are appreciated.\nEDIT: also, I would prefer not to enter many passwords to do this so if possible that would be preferred, if nessesary I can but it would be harder.

It now says it is full, and that it will delete old backups in order to make space to backup my current computer data. Does this mean that I am possibly losing important files (from two years ago) that I will therefore never again have access to? How does Time Machine decide what to delete?\n\nA: It deletes the oldest backups, as well as deleting all old backups each day, to make one backup each day. Unless you don't want to backup any more, older backups must be deleted. If you really have important files, why are they just on the Time Machine drive?\n", "Q: U.S. vs. Canadian English keyboard What is the difference between an US and a Canadian English keyboard layout? Could you give a visual comparison?\n\nA: The orginal question is for MacOS, but it may be useful for some to know that in iOS the act of using the particular keyboard while typing causes the auto-corrections and auto-suggestions to respect regional differences in spelling. Typing “color” while using Canadian English will result in a correction, while the same will happen if you type “colour” while using the US English keyboard. Likewise, the voice dictation feature will assume you want the regional spellings corresponding to your chosen input language. \n\nA: There's no difference except for the flag icon.  It is presumably there so that Canadians don't have to be looking at the US flag all the time to type their language.  The same holds for ABC, which is the same as US but no flag at all, for the rest of the world.\nUnfortunately Apple does not document anywhere the dozens of different software keyboards/input sources which it provides.\n\nA: Apple documents most hardware keyboards at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794\nIt has both French Canadian as well as English\n\nA: I do not really understand the question. But there are many many keyboards for the macbook (pro) and other \"hardware\" keyboards.\nFor the software keyboards: if you compare the CanadianEnglish and the US International in Keyboard Preferences, you will see that they are NOT the same for special characters, when you hold Shift+Option, for example.\n\nA: The Canadian English keyboard has French accents when you least need them (I'm Canadian English). Here's an example that I copied from an email from someone who hasn't figured out how to fix it yet. Nov 21é18\n\nA: One crucial difference in my opinion: The cincunflex \"^\" character on top of the 6 are different for the two keyboards. That causes a lot of confusion and wasted time if one of the two is in a password.

I tried several combinations, but I have not found any way so far to mute audio (playing in any application, system wide) using a normal PC-Keyboard (Cherry G80) connected to my Mac Book Pro (2011).\nOn the built-in keyboard of the MacBook Pro this is simply done by pressing F10 (or Fn-F10, depending on the Pref settings).\nI would like to get the Fn+F10 functionality working on the external keyboard. Apparently Apple keyboards have an explicit Fn key and there is seems to work.\nWhat I tried is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I remapped the Windows Menu key (Application key) to Fn using KeyRemap4MacBook\n\n*I made it so that F10 does not show the current Application Window, so F10 is free\n\n*Still, when I press F10 or Fn+F10 on the extrenal keyboard, nothing happens\n\n\nTo me it seems that the audio mute functionality is pretty low level in the keyboard stack.\nAny thoughts welcome.\n\nA: The only thing I could think of is making two services (mute + unmute) through Automator and then assigning these services to two different shortcuts from the settings panel.\n\n\n*\n\n*First open Automator and choose service, then add a shell from the actions menu \n\n*Next write the shell script to mute/unmute and save them \n\n\nTo mute : osascript -e \"set volume with output muted\"\nTo unmute : osascript -e \"set volume without output muted\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services, find the two services you created and assign the shortcut you want.\n\n\nA: Two options: (1) using Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4Macbook) which you already have installed, or (2) using BetterTouchTool which allows more flexible remapping.\nMaybe you have an older version without this capability, but update to the latest version of Karabiner and you will see an \"F10 to Volume Mute\" remap option.\n\nFor this problem, BetterTouchTool also works well. Although it's primarily focused on mapping trackpad gestures to various actions, it also allows remapping of keyboard keys. This is a bit more flexible than Karabiner for this example, since it doesn't require the exact preset you want to already exist.\n\n", "Q: Handbrake CLI Transcoded Video not Playable in Quicktime and Itunes i am transcoding a bunch of videos with handbrake CLI.

Usually the newest installer available in the App Store already includes the update. \nTo get the build version of the OS installed by the OS X installer.app enter in Terminal.app:\ncat /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep -A 1 BuildMachineOSBuild\n\nThe output\n\n\n*\n\n*15A... usually indicates a 10.11.0 build\n\n*15B... usually indicates a 10.11.1 build\n\n*15C... usually indicates a 10.11.2 build\n\n\nand so on. The build version here is not identical with the build version of the later installed operating system. To get that one you have to mount the InstallESD.dmg in \"/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/\". Then cd to \"/Volumes/OS X Install ESD\" and enter \"open BaseSystem.dmg\".\nTo get the Build or System version then enter:\ncat /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 1 ProductBuildVersion\n\nor \ncat /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 1 ProductVersion\n\nWith the new OS X installer you can create a new bootable USB.\nDepending on your internet connection that's probably faster and less hassle/error-prone than merging an update in an older full installer.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan – \"package is not compatible\" error The build machine used in my project is not based on OS X El Capitan – it is running Yosemite. \nSo far I've never had problems with the generated installer file (.pkg), but on El Capitan, I receive the error \"this package is incompatible with this version of OS X...\"\n\n\n*\n\n*What could be the reasons of such incompatibility?

I would like to run OS X El Capitan on an older, black MacBook 4,1 (Early 2008 model with 2GB of RAM).\nHowever, after looking at the El Capitan specifications, it appears that OS X 10.11 requires at least a \"Late 2008 Aluminium\" unibody MacBook.\nMy first question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone here have OS X 10.11 running on a MacBook 4,1?\n\n\nProbably a more realistic second question is: \n\n\n*\n\n*What is the latest version of OS X that I can get running on a MacBook 4,1 Early 2008 model?\n\n\nA: As you mentioned, OS X El Capitan will run on the MacBook (13-inch Aluminium, Late 2008) model, known as MacBook 5,1. \nThe latest version of OS X that you can get running on a MacBook 4,1 (Early 2008 model) is Mac OS X 10.7.5. El Capitan will not run on the non-Aluminium 2008 models (Early or Late).\nI have verified this information against the Mactracker app (not affiliated with Mactracker in any way).\n\nA: On the plus side the MacBook4,1 has not only a 64-Bit CPU but also a 64-Bit EFI. But that's about it, because...\nThe problem is the integrated graphics processor (GMA), in the case of  the MacBook \"Core 2 Duo\" Early 2008 aka MacBook4,1 the Intel GMA X3100. There are only 32-bit drivers (in OS X terms: kexts) available. Since OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion the OS is exclusively 64-Bit.\nApple did try to get 64-Bit drivers for the Intel GMA950 as well as the GMA X3100. They were even briefly included in Mac OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard. They had only very basic functions (I think they lack support for both Quartz Extreme and Core Image) and were in a very early develpment state.\nThe problem is that without the graphics drivers the OS doesn't work.\nThere are unofficial attempts to get Mountain Lion (10.8), Mavericks (10.9) and Yosemite (10.10) on those otherwise unsupported Macs. One of those attempts is MacPostFactor and macOS Extractor by OS X Hackers. AFAIK only Mountain Lion (10.8) works with the incomplete 64-Bit drivers from Mac OS X 10.6.2. It seems to be possible to get up to El Capitan (10.11) but all of it without accelerated graphics. If you search the Internet you will find verious reports, e.g. this guide on MacRumors for OS X Yosemite (10.10).\nIn any case such an endeavor is not trivial.\n\nA: you can use this hacked EFI to boot 10.11 on older 64bit CPUs with 32bit EFI https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader\n\nA: I did run the mac 4.1 on El capitan, it runs very smooth, however I not sure what I did wrong , my mouse and key board were not functional, again with 2 GB of ram the elcapitan ran better then I expected, I downgraded with a clean install of the mountain lion after that 10.6.0 as the computer ran 10 times faster on it. \nbottom line elcapitan was possible, the EFI was not working , so I had to use options in my boot. \nany ways it does run and I am not an expert.  \n", "Q: How to type a capital letter from the extended Latin alphabet in OS X I'm aware that if you want to type a character from extended Latin alphabet in OS X (like in the word über), you just press the basic symbol key for a while and then a popup occurs with the list of extended symbols.\n\nBut, I would like to type this letter in uppercase. I press the symbol key (for Example U + Shift), then see the character popup. Then I press the number of the required symbol, although I am given an @ sign instead of the uppercase Ü.\nHow can I type capital letters with accents? I don't want to copy and paste symbols that I require every time from the web or developer console.\n\nA: Hold the shift key then the number corresponding.  It works just fine.  I think you are forgetting to let go of the shift before hitting the number.  Hence the unexpected output.\n\nHold shift+U then, after popup let go of the shift key and hit the corresponding number.\nÜ ← result\n\nA: I've been looking for a while for the answer but didn't get lucky. It turned out that you have to press the basic symbol key for a while to request the system popup.\nWhen holding Shift and basic letter key, press left/right arrows to choose necessary symbol.

Should I \"recalibrate\" the batteries?\nThanks!\n\nA: The system management controller is responsible for reading battery voltages and reporting it to the operating system. You could reset that one time to see if it made a difference. When the output voltage of the battery shifts like that, it's a sign of failure within the battery. \nGetting the machine serviced would be the way to fix that if it's not the SMC. \n\nA: I’ve never heard of this issue, but I think it would be a good idea to calibrate the battery. If you haven’t calibrated it in a while, that very well could be the solution. This is because lithium-ion batteries have micro-controllers which measure the amount of remaining charge and use that information to tell the computer the percentage of remaining battery power, but the micro-controllers aren’t flawless. To get an accurate reading, the battery needs to be fully discharged and recharged. Only using a portion of the battery and recharging can, over time, confuse the micro-controller.\n", "Q: Unable to set DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH in shell on OSX 10.11.1 In shell scripts used for unit testing with dynamic libraries in a directory other than the typical @rpath, I have previously been able to set DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH to set the directory containing the libraries.

Before connecting it to an external monitor, I upgraded to El Capitan and the device on its own is functioning perfectly.\nWhen I connect it to my external monitor, a Dell U2412M, certain parts of the display are blurry. Some research indicated that it may be using the wrong colour space and using the well known script I generated and installed a new profile to force RGB. There may have been a slight improvement, hard to tell...\nI then read about setting 'AppleFontSmoothing' and tried all available settings, again, there may have been a slight improvement. I'd pretty much decided to live with it.

Can I leave those two cards in place and simply add two new 4 GB memory cards, or do I need to remove the existing cards? Is it OK to mix 2 GB and 4 GB memory cards, provided I stay under Apple's 16 GB limit?\n\nA: Absolutely. RAM can be mismatched and combined in every way.

Is there an automatic warranty that comes with these hard drives or did I have to pay an extra amount to get the warranty. This hard drive was installed fairly recently so It shouldn't be failing like this.\n\nA: Since you had an Apple authorized service provider for my repair (i.e. the Genius Bar) you now have coverage under two legal agreements.\nThe original warranty on the machine is still in effect ( or is expired ) but it does not get extended due to the fact that you had a repair. http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/\nThe AppleCare terms of service generally offer a 90 day warranty on all parts that runs concurrently with whatever other AppleCare service agreement or original warranty exist. \nSince your repair was a year ago, the 90 days certainly isn't going to cover you and it would be your responsibility to pay for the repair at this point instead of apple's responsibility. http://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/terms/repair/retailservice.html\nThe only out would be if you had purchased AppleCare on the original machine and if you were still within the three-year window for coverage. In that case the repaired machine and parts are covered as if they were the original machine and parts.

Am trying to find a simple audio converter to convert various m4a, wma, mp3, and flac files to standard mp3 128KB VBR (for an ancient mp3 player with limited storage).\nI'm probably only going to use this once and this is the one thing it needs to do however if it comes with additional features that'd be great too.\nAfter looking into it a bit more (I've come from Windows recently so I know mp3 very well) I've discovered the benefits of m4a files over mp3. So I think I'm looking for a program that supports m4a output as well. Just wanted to throw that in there.\nAlso if it helps any I'm using a Late 2006 iMac, Core 2 Duo 2.0GHz, 4GB RAM, OS X 10.7.5.\n\nA: Get ffmpeg via Homebrew, which can convert a lot of audio/video formats.\nConverting your audio files then basically is done by running the following in Terminal\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -b:a 128k output.mp3\n\nffmpeg is usually able to deduce input/output format from the file suffix.\n\nTo run this over a bunch of files, cd to the top folder containing the audio files and run\nfind . -type f -print0 | \n    xargs -0 -I '{}' bash -c 'f=\"{}\"; ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -b:a \"${f%.*}.128.mp3\"'\n\nThis will create files ending in .128.mp3 for all audio files found (and throw a lot of ffmpeg errors for non-audio files in the same folders).\n\nA: You might want to give Max a try.\nAlthough it hasn't been updated in quite a while, I got a lot of mileage out of it for a number of years. (I stopped using Max after purchasing Fission from Rogue Amoeba.)\n\nA: While I've had multiple good suggestions for programs here I wanted to post my own answer as no one answered with the program XLD (it was in a comment by @MaxRied however).\n\nX Lossless Decoder(XLD) is a tool for Mac OS X that is able to decode/convert/play various 'lossless' audio files. The supported audio files can be split into some tracks with cue sheet when decoding.\n\nWhile confusing and over the top at first the learning curve didn't take too long to get over and in the end it is a very solid program that does everything I need and then some. One word of warning however, it will not re-convert files. So if you have a bunch of 320KBps MP3s and want to convert them to 128KBps MP3s it will refuse to do so. Other than that huge annoyance (I switched to Max recommended by @TraneFrancks to finish off these files) it works great.\n\nA: I have been using All2MP3 for Mac for years, not much it won't convert to mp3.\nNOTE INFO AT THE BOTTOM, NO LONGER SUPPORTED.\nAll2MP3 is a free application for Mac computers, with a simplistic interface, designed to do one thing: convert your audio files into MP3 files. It doesn't require a help file -- All2MP3 is ready to use from the moment you launch the app, but we did find that it wouldn't convert all file types.\nThe application's interface is as simple as its installation: just a simple drag-and-drop window, and an Add button that can be used to browse files. All2MP3 supports a wide variety of audio formats, such as MPC, APE, WV, Flac, OGG, WMA, AIFF, WAV, and even video formats such as Apple's native MOV format. It excels at what it is supposed to do, and during our testing we loved the speed at which it converted our movie and audio files to MP3. You can use a slider to adjust the quality of the final MP3 file from \"Less\" to \"Super,\" as well as change the path to where the file is saved. We were pleasantly surprised when we looked at the timer after putting the application to work to convert a huge number of audio files. We were also surprised by the audio quality after converting MOV video files.\nThe one downside we found was that All2MP3 couldn't convert iTunes' M4A format, but with its performance on other file types, we still feel this is a very handy addition to your Mac toolbox. Overall, All2MP3 is a useful little app that fits the bill if you are looking to convert most files into MP3 quickly and for free. Its simple interface makes it ideal for all levels of users.\n", "Q: What is \"usernoted\" and why is it eating my CPU?

Currently, I'm struggling with the cluster size or block size. I've read a lot about it but I could not find a clear answer on what the fastest cluster size would be. Does anyone know what the fastest cluster size is?\n\nA: Short answer: don't worry about cluster size. You won't notice a difference.\nDeeper answer: logic would dictate that the larger the cluster, the fewer the number of requests for data would be necessary since it would be larger chunks. However, with a proper USB 3.0 stick you're honestly not going to see a difference worth fussing over. FWIW, the cluster size is traditionally more of a space optimization than anything else; fewer clusters means a smaller disk usage table, less overhead bits, etc. However, larger clusters means more wasted space since you a file 3 bytes in size is still going to take up a whole 4K cluster.\nSince you're on a Mac (you ARE on apple.stackexchange.com), you'd probably use FAT32 and not NTFS. Don't use FAT12/16. HFS+ will limit you to a Mac. NTFS isn't really supported on OSX and you might trip on permission ACLs.

Here's the entire folder tree:\nEFI\n   - refind\n       - icons\n       - keys\n       - refind_x64.efi\n       - refind.conf\n   - tools\n       - gptsync_x63.efi\n\n\nA: The gptsync_x64.efi program file was probably installed with rEFInd, but is a separate program. Leaving it in place should do no harm, but will also probably do no good, so it's a judgment call on your part. If you remove rEFInd, chances are the only thing that would run gptsync_x64.efi would be a subsequent install of rEFInd (or of its predecessor, rEFIt) or launching it manually from an EFI shell.\n", "Q: Use Terminal.app to ssh to multiple hosts Is there any app or \"trick\" to use Terminal to mirror commands to different ssh hosts (clusters, usually)?\nI do not want to use another terminal application.\nEDIT: sorry but the revision from timothymh actually made the meaning of my question to be different. What I would like is an application where I can manually issue mirrored commands to different servers while I am working on them, not a script or a system (like Puppet) to just issue known commands. That's why I mentioned that I hate those I tried (iTerm2 and so on) because of the look and feel.\nI like the way the standard terminal app behaves and looks in term of fonts, keyboard mapping, way of scrolling up and down and so on.\n\nA: You can write a shell script and put it in ~/.bashrc like this:\nfunction do_some_thing() {\n  command=\"fab -R localhost deploy --set sha=master\"\n  ssh -t ubuntu@1.2.3.4 -C \"$command\"\n  ssh -t ubuntu@1.2.3.5 -C \"$command\"\n  ssh -t ubuntu@1.2.3.6 -C \"$command\"\n  ssh -t ubuntu@1.2.3.7 -C \"$command\"\n}\n\nHowever there are various tools you can use for this type of activity, like Chef or Capistrano or various others.\n\nA: you can use pdsh, even if you have Chef its going to be faster.  with Chef, knife-search (inherent in knife-ssh) is an expensive operations, but you can dump the results of the search knife search node role:base -i > base.nodes and then use pdsh (written in C) to operate on the set (obviously you can do this part without Chef).  pdsh -w^base.nodes \"sudo whoami\" or whatever.  pdsh comes with a companion tool dshbak which can summarize the output of the hosts into a convenient report for you, too.  \njust make sure that you arent doing one-off management at a massive scale using tools like this.  its great for auditing and kicking off jobs, but it is not a replacement for config management.\n", "Q: Any way to change sound output device via Applescript or shell? I would like to change sound output device (like option-clicking the speaker icon in the menubar) via script, but NOT through UI scripting, e.g., launching the System Pref panel.\nUPDATE: Using @Mateusz solution below, here is an Applescript that, when launched, will give you a popup to select the desired audio output device:\nset devices to do shell script \"/Applications/Audiodevice/audiodevice output list\"\nset answer to choose from list (paragraphs of devices) with title \"Audio Output\" with prompt \"Select a device\" without multiple selections allowed\nif answer is false then return\ndo shell script \"/Applications/Audiodevice/audiodevice output \" & quoted form of item 1 of answer\n\n(Note: you need to put the audiodevice file in /Applications)\n\nA: There's audiodevice command available from whoshacks.\nUsage:\n\n\n*\n\n*audiodevice    list devices for input, output, and system audio\n\n*audiodevice <port>    display the audio device for the selected port\n\n*audiodevice <port> list    list available audio devices for the selected port\n\n*audiodevice <port> <device>    set the selected port to use the designated device (\"internal\" will select Internal Speakers or Headphones, whichever is active)\n\n\nA: There's switchaudio-osx, command which needs to be compiled from sources or can be installed via homebrew (Xcode installation required):\nbrew install switchaudio-osx\n\nUsage:\nSwitchAudioSource [-a] [-c] [-t type] [-n] -s device_name\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-a : shows all devices\n\n*-c : shows current device\n\n*-t type : device type (input/output/system).

Also I couldn't find an elegant solution for swapping between 3 audio outputs using if-else. Not to mention if the source is not always in the output list (e.g. bluetooth headphones).\nSo I wrote the below which will simply loop through all of the options and select the next source in the list / the first source in the list if the last option is selected.  Just change the sourceToChange variable from \"Output\" to \"Input\" if you'd like to make another script for swapping microphone sources.  One downside to this approach is that you have to grant \"Control your computer\" access for any app that calls this workflow / quick action.

I'd estimate that on a typical day, it manages to work about 10% of the time it is running. Mostly I just quit and leave the app closed to avoid the annoyance of constant warning dialogs interrupting me while I'm working. (Connection Doctor never shows any errors or difficulties.)\nIs there something simple I might do to fix this? Is this a known problem with 10.11.1?\n\nA: Check to see if you have _mbsetupuser running. If you do your update to 10.11.1 (or to 10.11.2 or 10.11.3, for that matter) has not completed. \nThough the \"About This Mac\" dialog may say that your version is 10.11.1, you are in fact effectively between versions, and will get all kinds of odd behavior (repeated requests to unlock the Keychain, connectivity problems, wifi issues, etc.) until you complete the installation process, which you should be able to accomplish with a reboot.\n\nA: I have also run into this issue after an update from 10.11.x to 10.12.\nWhen SSH'ing into the server as admin I would actually be the _mbsetupuser account every other time.\nEvery other time I tried to connect via ARD I would be denied access.\nA reboot did not fix the issue for me.\nI had to create a new admin account in system preferences, log in as that admin, delete the old admin account, and recreate it.\n", "Q: Precautions to prevent iPhone virus from attachment In a momentary lapse of sanity, I opened up an attachment (a .pdf) from an unknown email address (the domain doesn't seem to be a website) in the gmail app on my iPhone 5.

In particular, I often use Growl to display custom notifications.  From the command line, I can use the growlnotify executable to display something like this:\n$ growlnotify -a \"Google Chrome\" -m \"Text Copied\" \"Google Chrome\"\n\n\nI'd like to somehow modify the global copy/paste behaviour to create a Growl notification like this no matter where I perform the operation and no matter what I'm copying (text, files, etc.).  Is this possible using Automator/AppleScript (I'm only vaguely familiar with AppleScript)?  Or something else?\n\nA: You can use applications like Keyboard Maestro (my preference), FastScripts, Spark to run a script which displays notification every time you press Cmd+C, or Cmd+V. Below is the Copy script which posts notification in Growl. Though you could also post these to OS X notification centre too.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set foremostApplication to name of first process where it is frontmost\nend tell\ntell application \"Growl\"\n    register as application \"Pasteboard Notifier\" all notifications {\"Copied\", \"Pasted\"} default notifications {\"Copied\"}\n    notify with name \"Copied\" title \"Copied!\" description \"New Clipboard Item\" application name \"Pasteboard Notifier\" icon of application foremostApplication\nend tell\n\nI tried creating a service through Automator, and binding that to Cmd+C; it didn't seem to work. You'd be better of using a app made to do this kind of work.\nEdit: 05/11/15 \nI noticed that service created via the method above did work in Steam, while not in other Applications.

I've recently started a project that's going to entail using GarageBand. I'd heard it was free, and I searched it in Spotlight. Just to clarify, I am currently running El Capitan. Lo and behold, it did not appear in Spotlight, despite having a reference to the GarageBand app in the App Store. I clicked the App Store link, and it took me to the GarageBand app page where I observed, my confusion growing by the minute, that its price was actually $4.99. I googled it and arrived at an apple site saying that GarageBand is free to all users that have used 10.10. I bought my iMac with OS X Mountain Lion and since then have updated to El Capitan. While I haven't downloaded GarageBand ever I'm pretty sure, I should still have access, no? Every other iApp is there: iPhoto, iMovie, Keynote, Pages and Numbers, so why not GarageBand? I've still got the installation apps for Mavericks and Yosemite, and I had a friend recommend I partition my drive and install Mavericks and bring GarageBand over, but I've got no clue how to do that and I've had bad experiences with downgrading OS, so I'd definitely need guidance if that's the way to go. \n\nA: Garageband used to be free. There was also a $4.99 in-app purchase to get extras.

If not, the developer of TotalTerminal says the reason he stopped working on it is that he switched to iTerm 2, which he says \"offers similar functionality to Visor and comparable features to build-in [sic] Terminal.app.\" I've never used either, but another question on this site explains how to set up iTerm to work in a similar manner.\n\nA: I often use treeterm (http://www.treeterm.com).

I accidentally deleted a folder I need in my bookmarks in Safari. I back up my phone using iCloud. How do I get this folder back on my phone now?\n\nA: On your iOS 9 or iOS 8 device: Go to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage, then tap your iPhone listed under Backups to see the date and size of its latest backup. Go to Settings > General > Reset, then tap “Erase all content and settings.” In the Setup Assistant, proceed to “Set up your device,” tap Restore from a Backup, then sign in to iCloud. Proceed to “Choose backup,” then choose from a list of available backups in iCloud.\nWARNING: Don't continue to the second, Reset, step if your iPhone does not show any available backup sets from which to restore. If you reset your phone and erase all settings without having a backup with which to work, you'll end up losing all your data rather than just bookmarks.

Using Cmd-G shows me the root directory but does not allow me to copy the folder into it.\nHow do I copy this folder into my root directory? (I'm running El Capitan.)\n\nA: OS X prevents you from copying files and folders to the root directory or your \"Macintosh HD\". It prefers you write files only in your user directory to prevent accidental file deletions, overwrites, etc.\nHowever, if you have a file or folder on your Desktop, and you are an administrator on the computer, you can copy the file using your super user privileges.\nSimply open up the Terminal application. You can use Spotlight to search for it or go to your Applications folder, then Utilities folder.\nOnce in Terminal, you'll be faced with a prompt. \nRun the command below to put the file or folder in your root directory. Put the name of the file or folder in place of \"FILE\".\nsudo cp -p Desktop/FILE /\n\nPress the return key. You'll be prompted for your password.\nsudo is a command to provide super user privileges. cp is copy. -p means to preserve the file owner and permissions. \nIf you are required to change the owner or permissions of the file, you can run a command like chown change owner or chgrp change group or chmod change file permissions.\n", "Q: iOS 9.1 update.

And I share the music app with my brother and he deleted all my old playlist so now I have about 4 songs. How do I add a playlist? And how do stop sharing the app with my brother? \n\nA: To add a new playlist, go to your music app, on the bottom left corner there should be a \"My music\" icon, there are a \"Edit\" and a  \"New\" button, click on \"New\" and you will be able to create a new playlist. \nFor the sharing problem, you should be able to see \"All Playlists\" displayed, click on it and tick the \"Only offline music\" toggle, it should solve the issue. \n", "Q: How to recover a dead Mac mini? A friend of me just deleted everything by running sudo rm -rf / on his Mac mini.

Now what can we do to save the system and recover some important files?\n\nA: First the bad news, there is no simple 'un-rm'/un-delete and everything will be as it was before. \nAssuming your friend doesn't have a TimeMachine Backup of the Data (hence the implied urgency), there are several steps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access the device\n\n*recover deleted files \n\n*rebuild the system\n\n\nre 1: If you have access to another Mac and you have a thunderbolt cable, you can try to access the drive of the MacMini with \"Target Disk Mode\" (hold T on Startup, see Apple Support here). You can then try to recover the files (Step 2), f.e. with a GUI based Software (usually commercial) like 'Disk Drill', 'File Salvage' or 'Data Rescue' (of course there are others). Most of the commercial Software have a Demo-Version, so you can try before you buy.\nIf you don't have access to another Mac or a TB Cable you could try to start the recovery partition with Cmd + R and then run the Terminal, trying to recover files via the Terminal with the methods mentioned on this Post in 'SuperUser', \nIf your friend is uncomfortable with the Terminal, he/you could try to install OSX on a USB-Stick or an external Harddrive and boot the MacMini from the external Drive (see Apple Support here). You could then try to run the GUI-Software mentioned in Step 1.\nJust to be clear - a recovery of Data and the OS 'in Place' (on the same Harddrive/Machine you trashed before) is not advisable, even if it would be possible. You are most likely overwriting the Data you want to recover. Your friend should have another Harddrive ready to copy the recovered Data to. After recovery we get to step 3.\nre 3: After recovering the important Data to another Drive you can rebuild the System. Again, start the MacMini in recovery Mode (Cmd + R) an choose Reinstall OS X (see Apple Support here for detailed instructions). \n\nA: Assuming that your friend has a Time Machine backup, it's a simple matter to boot to the recovery partition via Cmd+R at the startup chime, then choose to restore from backup. It'll take anywhere from a few hours to quite a while to restore depending on the size of the backup set. You'll want to be on a wired network rather than trying to restore over WiFi.\nIf no backups of any kind exist, about all that remains is to do an Internet Recovery of the OS and start everything from scratch again. Internet Recovery is started with the same Cmd+R and then choosing to reinstall OS X.\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: Find which Safari window is playing video? Safari 9.0.1 launches and restores previously open windows. The app has the rude default behavior of automatically restarting any open videos. \nWith many open windows and tabs, how can I find the window playing the video?\nIn Chrome, I can use Window > Task Manager to view a list of processes. The busy one has the video. Double-clicking brings that window to the front. Anything similar in Safari?\n\nA: In Safari 9 (and probably later), a blue speaker icon appears in the URL bar of all windows whenever any window is playing audio. You can click on this to mute the current tab (if it's playing audio) or all other tabs (if the current one is playing audio). \nThis icon also has a hidden feature: If you click and hold on it, you will see a list of all the tabs that are currently playing sound. Click on one of those, and the corresponding window will be brought to the front. Then you can stop that particular video.\n\n\nA: in the latest version of Safari, the Tab(s) which are playing audio/video will show a small Speaker icon on the right-side of the Tab. you can click on the speaker to Mute the audio. the address bar also shows the speaker icon with the playing tab is selected, playing in the foreground.\n", "Q: How to store note only on my Mac in Notes 4?

It now includes a checklist feature. This feature becomes available after you agree to \"upgrade\" (convert) your existing data.\nIs there some way to re-order the items in a checklist? \nI tried dragging, but I cannot find any thing on which to click to initiate the drag. I looked at the context menu, but no such item. The main menus offer a Format > Mark as Checked item, but nothing about moving items.\n\nA: Starting with macOS Catalina, you can position the cursor on an item, and then use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl ⌃+Cmd ⌘+up or Ctrl ⌃+Cmd ⌘+down to move the item up or down, respectively.\n\n*\n\n*Control ⌃ + Command ⌘ + ↑\n\n*Control ⌃ + Command ⌘ + ↓\nSee also pages from Apple’s Notes User Guide:\n\n*\n\n*Write and format notes on Mac (Big Sur 11)\n\n*Write and format notes on Mac (Catalina 10.15)\n\n\nMove a list item up (or down) in the list: Press Control-Command-Up Arrow (or Control-Command-Down Arrow).\n\nFurthermore, checked items can auto-sort to the bottom.

Is it safe to delete some bulky fonts stored on OS X, such as the ones shown below? \nWhat's the worst that can happen? Would things simply disappear or if a font can't be found will it just be replaced by another, possibly lower quality one?\nEDIT: Talking about library/fonts here, not the System Fonts\n\n\nA: Deleting any fonts in /System will require the disablement of System Integrity Protection (\"rootless feature\") on OS X El Capitan. SIP reduces the potential attack surface for system exploits; disablement is not recommended.\nThe recommended method of deletion for any other fonts is through Font Book (rather than a direct deletion using Finder, Terminal or a cleanup application).\nThis question and accepted answer were originally linked to a Lion issue, but the basis should still apply:\n\nYou can save several dozen megabytes by deleting certain Asian fonts if you don't need them. Don't delete system fonts directly in the Finder.\nRather, do it through the Apple Font Book application, which will prevent you from deleting the \"reserved\" system fonts that Mac OS X expects to see when it boots up, but permit you to delete \"non-essential\" fonts.\n\nIf OS X is unable to render the character set with the required font, it is likely that a \"substitute symbol character\" will appear instead.\n", "Q: Recommended power bank capacity for iPhone 4S I would like to know the recommended capacity in a power bank to charge my iPhone 4S on the go. \nI've seen power banks with over 4000 mAh of capacity. Wouldn't that damage my iPhone, since I read that the iPhone 4S has a battery of 1430 mAh and the charger is 1000 mAh.\nWouldn't the recommended capacity be around those values?\nAnd one more question, how do we calculate how the iPhone would charge? For example:\nI have a friend that has 2 power banks, one of 4400 mAh and other of 2600 mAh. She says that she can charge her iPhone twice to 100% with the 4400 mAh power bank and she can only charge to 80% with the 2600 mAh. \n\nA: The power bank capacity is just that, capacity. So the bigger the capacity, the more often you can recharge your iPhone before you need to recharge your power bank. Give or take a few mAh getting lost on the way, the number of recharges possible is basically Capacity of power bank divided by Capacity of iPhone.\nThis also means that there is no recommended capacity per se. Questions you may want to ask yourself before buying one include\n\n\n*\n\n*do I need to recharge several time a day or is one recharge usually enough?\n\n*do I plan to take multi-day cross-country hikes without power outlets on the way\n\n*is low weight important for me (more capacity usually means more weight)\n\n*do I just want to recharge one device or is the goal to charge e.g. an iPad as well\n\n", "Q: Where does Chrome's Gmail Offline store its files on my Mac? I have added Gmail Offline to Chrome on OS X Mavericks. Where on my Mac are the offline files (such as attachments) and the app itself stored?\nGoogle nor StartPage are very helpful in finding any real answers.\n\nA: Gmail Offline usually stores its files under your profile path.  \nYou can find your profile path by typing chrome://version in the address bar, and searching for Profile Path.  \nThe path is usually: \n\n/Users/%username%/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/  \n\nAlternatively, if you are logged in under the account you want to explore, the path is:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/\n\nIf you have a Chrome user profile other than the default one, replace Default with that profile name.  \nYou should then look at the \"Local Storage\" and \"Local Extension Settings\" directories under that path. \n\nA: The actual files (attachments etc.) are stored in \n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/File System\n\nIn that folder my gmail files were stored under 009/t/ and then 100 files per subfolder, numbered 00 and up. Within these \"File System\" folders all files are numbered in sequence by which you first viewed/downloaded them and they don't have any file endings.\nI would assume that unique apps are attributed their own \"File System\" subfolder by sequence in which you first use them. So gmail files may not alway be in subfolder \"009\".\n", "Q: Is there a more convenient VPN toggle in iOS 9.1? Is there an convenient way for me to toggle VPN on or off in iOS 9.1 without navigating through the Settings screen each time?\nPreviously (on Android), I used an app to automate this based on my location and it was pretty reliable. Searching through the App Store, I am unable to find any advanced automation apps. \nI have discovered FlipControlCenter which would place a convenient toggle button in the swipe up menu, however I'm currently running iOS 9.1 and would like to avoid jailbreaking if possible.\nI am aware that some paid VPN services do have apps which can be launched and used to toggle VPN on or off, however I am running my own personal VPN service.\n\nA: Try VPNOn (AppStore link).

I've tried resetting passwords via Terminal and also to activate and use the root single user, but nothing works. When I run ls /Users, I can still see all the folders of the users.\nI'm at a loss as to where to start. I'd happily rebuild the OS from scratch if I could backup the disk from Terminal in some way.\nAny suggestions on restoring the user accounts or backing up from Terminal?\n\nA: Backup first, via a second Mac if possible:\nIf you have a second Mac, you can put the troublesome one in Target Disk Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*During startup, hold the \"T\" key.  \n\n*Connect the two devices with Thunderbolt cable, or Firewire\n\n*The Target Mode device should mount like an external disk on your second Mac.\n\n*Make your backup.    \n\n\nAfter you have a backup (or choose not to make one)...\nTry to create a new (admin) user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot back into Single-User Mode (CMD-S) during startup.\n\n*Mount the drive: /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n*Remove this file: rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\n*Restart the computer: reboot \n\n*Go through Setup Assistant\n\n\nOnce you have a new Admin user, see what you can do with the accounts.\n", "Q: Can't start Mac in Recovery Mode When I start it, hold alt, then choose \"Recovery 10.11\" it takes about 50 minutes for the waiting bar to fill. After that, nothing happens (I tried leaving it up for about about 10 hours and 36 minutes). If I start it up by holding command R, it starts up in Internet Recovery Mode, but I need to use the normal mode because csrutil doesn't exist in the Internet Recovery Mode Terminal (it looks like a pre 10.10 design) and I can't change the shell to a newer one.\n\nA: ⌘ + R recovery mode (Internet Recovery) will restore the OS that originally came on your Mac, not the currently installed one.\nIt sounds like you will need to reinstall from scratch. That should setup a recovery partition that you can boot to. Use this command replacing MyVolume with the name of the USB drive to make an installer key.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nThe Apple instructions for this can be found here.\n\nA: By design of SIP, only the local recovery can change the local boot volume. \nIf you can boot to the local OS - you'll have the most ability to make a UDB installer to get you out of this jam as well as prevent needing internet recovery in the future (which in your case is 10.8). You could also try using Internet Recovery to reinstall an OS on top of what you have. That should re-install the system components harmlessly and patch yp your Recovery HD. If you can't get any installer to run and fix/repair/recreate your local RecoveryHD then wipe the drive and start over.\nMy answer on question The OS X upgrade couldn't be started because the disk is damaged and can't be repaired covers the erase procedure with links to Apple supper articles with step by step instructions. Since your local recovery is broken, use Disk Utility from Internet recovery to do the erasing. \nIf you can get a second Mac, target disk mode will speed this up greatly and also assist with backup if yours isn't current. \n", "Q: How do I find out which apple id's are authorized on my computer?

Wired claims that there is a difference because 3D Touch can detect levels of pressure, but in my experience Force Touch can as well.\nFor example, pressing the fast forward button in QuickTime with more or less force will switch between 2x, 4x, 8x etc. speed. \nIs there any capability difference between the two haptic/Taptic features?\n\nA: This is a lot like asking if there's a difference between a Nissan Leaf and a Maxima. Both are cars, they seat 4 people, and they move around. The technology powering them though, is radically different. Wikipeadia has the 3D Touch redirect to the Force Touch page, which is misleading (and incorrect). This article does a slightly better job explaining it, though it sort of steps on its own tail. Basically, Force Touch reacts based on the actual force (hard, medium, soft) where's de 3D Touch reacts based on the kind of touch (or tap): quick, prolonged, etc. \nEDIT:\nOn second reading, you ask more about capability than implementation. 3D touch is definitely more sensitive than Force Touch, but with only the 6S just rolling out, we'll need to wait and see what Apple chooses to do with this enhanced capability.\n", "Q: Vi for Mac OS, differences with Vim I am using Mac OS X, with vim and I am getting a bit used to it.

Behold, the fate of all (poorly handled) MagSafe power cables:\n\nWhy doesn't this shock me?  I've read that MagSafe cables are low voltage, but I don't even get a tingle.  Is there any danger of shock, arcing, and/or fire from a MagSafe cable in this condition?  If so, is a strip of electrical tape over the exposed wire a sufficient 'fix'? \nBonus question: what is the source of the green and yellow discoloration?\n\nA: The accepted answer is incorrect.\nThe outer wire sheath carries V-, connected to the outermost MagSafe pins. It's also connected to the inner metal part of the MagSafe connector, the part that snaps with the magnet. All of these were verified with a multimeter.\nWhen connected, it connects with the MacBook's ground system (checked with a multimeter). There's continuity between that metal sheath and GND, such as the outer metal part of a USB connector.\nIt's wrapped around an inner wire, which carries V+. Presumably, that's to help reduce RF emissions.\n\nWhy aren't you shocked? Most probably, your body simply doesn't make a good electrical path.\nI also cannot feel a shock when sitting on an office chair. However, I do feel a tingle when leaning against something earthed, like a concrete wall. It gets stronger the harder I lean against said wall, which reduces resistance to earth.\n\nA: Magsafe cables only carry voltages ranging from 14.5 to 20 volts, which is not nearly enough to be able to feel. For more information, see this Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange question. You would not be able to touch the actual conductors anyways as the metal \"wire\" that is visible in this picture does not carry any current, as it is just shielding around smaller insulated wires. It is unlikely for arcing to occur, but you should still get the charger replaced soon. Like iPhone and iPad chargers, always buy MagSafe chargers from an Apple Store or the Apple website as ones bought on eBay and Amazon are known to be non-UL listed counterfeits.\n", "Q: Configure sandbox permissions While trying to modify a property list I was rather surprised to receive the following error\nsh-3.2# cp com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist com.apple.mDSNResponder.plist.backup\ncp: com.apple.mDSNResponder.plist.backup: Operation not permitted\nand the Console has the following log entry:\n10/28/15 1:12:55.886 PM sandboxd[118]: ([13463]) cp(13463) System Policy: deny file-write-create /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDSNResponder.plist.backup\nWhich goes against the traditional UNIX paradigm of giving a user enough rope to hang themselves and a couple feet more. So my question would be, how can I configure sandbox permissions on OS X 10.11? I can't seem to find much documentation on them. Even where to store them seems ambiguous as I see them in framework bundles, in /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles and /usr/share/sandbox.\n\nA: That would be System Integrity Protection at work, you can find a detailed answer here.\n", "Q: How to add link to Sublime Text?

An iTunes error (documented in this AskDifferent thread) has left my library folders full of duplicate files, but with different extensions.

This has left me with the downloaded m4a files but also the original 'lost' mp3's - the files were never actually missing, but the links in the iTunes database were corrupted somehow.\nI could delete the entire local library and then download from iTunes Match/iCloud but it's a very large library and this could take many days on my internet connection.\nTrying to convert the 'known' mp3's to m4a's and deleting any left over 'lost' mp3's would take far too long.\nCould a terminal command or applescript search within a folder and match identical base file names but different mp3 and m4a extensions and then delete the corresponding mp3 file when found?

When I ran the boot camp assistant, I made sure the \"Download latest support software from apple\" box was checked. After that my computer rebooted and I installed Windows onto the newly created partition from a USB drive. I then booted into Windows, where an Installer for the Boot Camp Windows Software popped up. I installed it.\nI've read on the internet that the Boot Camp Support Software allows read-only access to the Macintosh HFS+ partition, BUT windows does not recognize the partition, I can't even read from it. Why is this? Is what I read wrong? Or is there a different thing I need to install that's not the software apple put on my Windows Install USB? Or is this feature simply not supported in Windows 10?\nI can't figure out why this drive is not accessible to me even though a bunch of places on the internet say that support is included in the Boot Camp Support Software, which I'm fairly sure I installed\nEDIT: I realize that there are other third party options to get both read and write support for HFS+, but I am specifically looking for an option built in by Apple.\n\nA: I finally solved it!\nThis literally took hours out of my day, but I now know what the problem was. It turned out that the drivers actually were installed. by verified this checking for the presence of the following files:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\AppleHFS.sys\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\AppleMNT.sys\n\nThe reason that the drive was unreadable is because they were encrypted with FileVault. I disabled FileVault in OS X, and when I booted into Windows again, the partition was mounted.\nThere might be a way to use FileVault and Boot Camp together, I'm not sure. I read in a few places, however, that if you enable FileVault after installing Windows with Boot Camp, you can have your drive encrypted and accessible from windows. (This is just a hunch however, I'll have to look into it more)\n", "Q: Finder reverts to SMB for shares set up as AFP My Mac Mini running the El Capitan (10.11.1) connects to my Synology DS 1515+ via AFP as follows; afp://c9_nas.local. Finder recognizes the NAS as a fellow Mac when performing a get info. (the multiple instances of the same Mac is annoying as well):\n\nWhen I click on the NAS in finder it takes a very long time to connect, 7 to 10 seconds.  When it does I open one of the folders and get info on an item.  It shows as SMB:\n\nThe get info for the NAS itself remains AFP.\nMy Synology is up to date.  I have tried switching between SMB 1 and 2 on the Synology box which makes no difference.  Unfortunately I have some Windows machines that need SMB so disabling it is not an option.\nIf I initiate a new connection to the NAS using finder->go->connect to server, using AFP, that connection is nearly instant.  It's the subsequent attempts to access the shared server that take so long to connect and yield SMB results.\nOne other bit of weirdness that it probably related somehow: if I use the device's IP instead of the .local name, subsequent attempts to access the share result in it disconnecting and not working at all.  \nAll of these behaviors survive reboots.\nI'm pretty sure that this wasn't an issue in Yosemite, but I cannot be certain of that.  It definitely did connect much faster though.\n\nA: Apple is switching to SMB, as multiple sources reported. And you can see this from the Apple Support article:\n\nWhen you connect from a Mac using OS X Mavericks or OS X Yosemite to another computer using file sharing, your Mac automatically tries to use the Service Message Block (SMB) protocol to communicate. If SMB is not available, it tries to connect using Apple File Protocol (AFP).  (How to connect with File Sharing on your Mac - Apple Support)\n\nIn fact, I have to disable SMB protocol on my NAS to use AFP. I think I will continue to do this till SMB supports case sensitive device names.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have my dock visible on all monitors in El Capitan? Don't mark this as a duplicate. Question has been asked several times in several places but it was years ago.\nI have two monitors connected. One primary (that has dock at the bottom) and secondary. My monitors aren't mirrored (cloned). Both of them display different stuff but the dock appears just on the primary one.\nIs it possible to see my dock (the same dock) on both of them?\n\nA: After extensive search, I have not found any solution specifically for the native macOS Dock.\nHowever, not wanting to put up with this nuisance, I configured the third party Contexts app to always be visible and show only icons when not hovered.\nI'm more than happy with this solution. The only drawback is that you cannot configure the context sidebar to be in the bottom of the display, like the dock.\nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with this app in any way.\n\nA: I am having the same issue. I found a somewhat useful article. \nIt's saying that you can view the dock on a secondary monitor if you swipe your mouse down twice (towards the edge of the screen) to view the dock on the secondary monitor. The issue is that it disappears from the other monitor. So, you will end up doing it as often as you switch from one monitor to another and need the dock. \nI'm curious if there's a better solution to this. \n\nA: Go to Mission Control preferences (click Apple icon in upper left of screen, then \"System Preferences\" then \"Mission Control). Then check \"Displays have separate spaces.\" See image below.\nNote: if you use multiple Spaces, checking this box will change how they behave. Switching Spaces will now only switch Spaces on the monitor that is currently active, rather than switching Spaces simultaneously across all monitors (the behavior when that box is not checked).\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Android on iOS? Ok so I was thinking, Can you run Android on a iOS device? I did some research and Android could run on ARM (Most apps would not work) but how come no one has tried to run it. Whats holding them back?  \n\nA: Many reasons\n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot create another file system\n\n*No firmware exists for this\n\n*It would void your warranty\n\n*Android device developers spend a lot of time developing their hardware and software to work together, just like iOS.\n\n*The amount of effort required (boot ROM firmware  modifications, bricked devices, etc) makes it much easier just to buy an Android if you really want one.\n\n\nA: There is no tool or way to do this by yourself. Theoretically, you could run Android on iOS but it would be near impossible. To do this, someone would have to reverse engineer Android and figure out how to dual boot an iOS device. It has been done in the past with the iPhone 2g and the iDroid project so it is possible but it has not been continued. If you have a computer, you can run Android on your computer using Bluestacks. However, at the moment, there is no way to run Android on your iOS devices.\n", "Q: Will stored emails on mail app be lost if I restore from a IPSW I no longer have access to the mail server to which my email client was connected. I am considering upgrading from iOS 8 to iOS 9.0 using an IPSW (not thorough the normal update which will take me to iOS 9.1). My concern is regarding the already downloaded and cached mail from the Exchange server which is currently accessible. Will it still be accessible after the restore? (i.e. does the application and data backup also store the emails already downloaded or does it rely on downloading them again from the server?)\n\nA: You can't update to 9.0, Apple is no longer signing 9.0.\n", "Q: Is iPhone activation locked if Find My iPhone is disabled? I have an iPhone 5c and before I hard resetted it I turned off Find My iPhone.\nI'm at the setup screen I don't have a SIM card for it yet. The phone asks me for my language, country, WiFi, then tells me to insert a SIM. Is it going to tell me I need the previous AppleID and password after I get the SIM card and insert it?\n\nA: If you disabled \"Find my iPhone\" you don't need an Apple ID to reactivate the phone. You will be asked for an Apple ID to log into iCloud etc. but this step can be skipped. \nSince you are still stuck at the SIM prompt, it's too early to know if the device is activation locked yet. Pass that step and then you'll know.\n\nA: If the device ask you for user & pass from previous user - then it's Activation locked and you need to ask the previous user for the details.\n\nA: If https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/ tells you your device has no activation lock, you won't be asked for the previous AppleID and password.\n", "Q: Sleepless Mac although disabled PowerNap I have got a late 2012 Mac Mini.\nI like that, when I put my mac to sleep, it sleeps but, my Mac, since I bought it, even if I put in sleep mode it keep working. \nFor example tonight I heard it working while I was sleeping (Mac is 1,5m from my pillow!) and this morning, looking at the console, it keep doing \n29/10/15 06:29:21,285 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:xvJCfnGe/EQhMHiLAfw7g6Yo9H error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,286 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:0FMuFyL3Yys/PPBGTitpl03kvm error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,296 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:eF41woRcEPyTixrXTfYoNNOsKv error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,299 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:CZlGqQrp/9K9fhZ2TgH6qtffzQ error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,300 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:by7oZw3Sw4DkHN7ijdFdsqVbeg error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,300 secd[332]:  __SOSCCProcessSyncWithAllPeers_Server_block_invoke sync with all peers failed: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:21,356 CloudKeychainProxy[341]:  __39-[UbiqitousKVSProxy doSyncWithAllPeers]_block_invoke_2 <UBK-s-pC---> syncWithAllPeers (null), rescheduling timer\n29/10/15 06:29:36,622 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:xvJCfnGe/EQhMHiLAfw7g6Yo9H error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,624 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:0FMuFyL3Yys/PPBGTitpl03kvm error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,634 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:eF41woRcEPyTixrXTfYoNNOsKv error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,637 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:CZlGqQrp/9K9fhZ2TgH6qtffzQ error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,638 secd[332]:  SOSEngineCreateMessage_locked 0tO+TZaAgGvPu3zt06Cf+Hoxvo:by7oZw3Sw4DkHN7ijdFdsqVbeg error in send: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,639 secd[332]:  __SOSCCProcessSyncWithAllPeers_Server_block_invoke sync with all peers failed: Error Domain=com.apple.security.sos.error Code=1032 \"peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found\" UserInfo={NSDescription=peer: dpTJSdz3zg6x6mbOpQZb5DX0Hx not found}\n29/10/15 06:29:36,673 CloudKeychainProxy[341]:  __39-[UbiqitousKVSProxy doSyncWithAllPeers]_block_invoke_2 <UBK-s-pC---> syncWithAllPeers (null), rescheduling timer\n\nall night long.\nI tried disabling PowerNap but that the result!\nIs there a way to put Mac really in standby mode?

That is the fix. If you do, just make it standard operating procedure to unplug and re-plug. Been using Mac Pro's for music production for many, many years. This is not a problem, it is just how they work. Same as you can't hibernate a Mac, and you can't wake one up from LAN.\nWhat seems to work on various systems (sometimes)is to have a Mac USB Keyboard directly connected to the computer and then have your items connected to the keyboard's ports.

On one Mac in my household I develop applications with various tools like Jekyll or Meteor. They usually have their own default ports for their development web servers; Jekyll uses 4000, Meteor 3000, and so.\nSo on that Mac I'd go to 127.0.0.1:4000 (or localhost instead of the IP address) to access my application. I have another Mac on the same LAN and I'd like to see that too. I thought it'd just be 192.168.0.164:4000 (for example), but that's not working. Pinging that IP works fine though, and so does SSHing (if I enable it in Sharing). I thought the 192.168.0.164 therefore would just translate to that Mac's localhost and the ports and HTTP would work fine.. I'm clearly missing something.\nThey're both pretty much fresh Macs: not much installed software. The firewall was off by default. I couldn't see anything in System Preferences > Sharing that seemed appropriate. How can I get 192.168.0.164:4000/3000/whatever port working?\n\nA: This may be considered a duplicate question as I arrived at the solution from this answer.. I didn't give up searching, sorry about that.\nTo help others I'll mention what I got wrong.\nI didn't have to change any firewall or sharing settings - it was to do with where the application was being hosted. I assumed that when I viewed 192.168.0.164 from the other Mac, it'd magically map to the host's 127.0.0.1... that is not the case!\nSo instead I explicitly hosted the application on 192.168.0.164 instead of 127.0.0.1 and it worked fine!\n", "Q: Time Machine Encryption Specs I'm looking for specs on Time Machine (TM) encryption. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does TM encrypt before transmitting over network?

Unfortunately, iTunes insist on erasing everything before synchronising the content, because it's not using the same iTunes library. Apparently, iTunes refuse to simply upload a file to the iPad. \nAt that point, I thought I could just transfer back the selection of books (not bought through any store, really just PDF files that happen to be on that iPad) and manually add them together with the new file I wanted originally. I have never been able to get the files back. It looks like Transfer purchases from ignore those files. (ITunes / Files / Devices / Transfer purchases from )\nSo I ended erasing the content of iBooks on the iPad to put a new file.\nAm I missing something, or is iTunes just developed with frustration in mind ?\n\nA: You are right about iTunes showing great signs of strain. It was designed for a pretty simple task that now overwhelms it with too many functions - it's very un-Mac like due to how long it has taken Apple to kill it and reinvent all the jobs it does with better tools.\nNow - transferring purchases was really simple in iOS 7 and earlier. There was no family sharing, there was no app thinning, there was no just in time downloadable resources, iBooks wasn't a separate app that can complicate things.\nI'll try to explain how to make use of the tools, but you will probably spend some time trying things out and changing your workflow to accommodate the tradeoffs that were made in designing iOS and iTunes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Each class of data has a \"sync source\" so you could for instance, sync iBooks from Mac A, Apps from PC B and songs from Mac C. You are right that iTunes is designed to wipe old content from a previous sync source before switching to a new source. You can usually transfer or back things up, accept the wipe and then proceed, but I've seen cases where you literally have to go get things again in this case. Especially when you don't sync with multiple computers and instead software bug resulted in the system thinking the same iTunes was a different iTunes.\n\n*You can get around this a little with a good backup - but pay attention to iCloud settings since if you skip backing up some things, you still have to re-download them.\n", "Q: Transfer audio book from iPad to Mac I bought an audio book on my iTunes account, using my iPad. Now I can't transfer it to my macbook. From my macbook, it does not appear in my purchases.\nIs there anyway to transfer it?\n\nA: Before you transfer your purchases, make sure that your MacBook is authorized with the same Apple ID account you used to make the purchases. \nAnd for audio books, only one download is normally allowed per purchase.

I also have Dropbox automatically importing my photos when connected too.\nDropbox has no problems importing my photos, but Photos does. I can see my iPhone connected, but I can't see any photos on my iPhone as you can see from this image: (The name \"Hold Me, Touch Me\" is a reference to movie \"The Producers\" with Zero Mostel.). As you can see, the name of my iPhone shows up, but not the 168 pictures on the phone.\nI suspect there is some [i]security setting[/i] where I have to tell Photos it has permission to read my iPhone, but I can't seem to find it.\n[]\n\nA: When I plugged in my iPhone this morning, it asked me if I wanted to share my photos with this device (meaning my computer). I clicked on \"Yes\", and the problem was solved. \nI thought the problem may be one where my iPhone didn't trust my computer to share the photos, but I couldn't find anything on the iPhone or my Mac. I checked iTunes too, but didn't see anything.\nOnce I gave my Mac permission to see my photos and everything is now fine. \n\nA: I discovered this problem after upgrading to High Sierra.\nMy iPhone was containing 94 photos.\nI don't use Dropbox nor iCloud, just the original USB cable (in a perfect state).\nI plugged my iPhone on my MacBook Pro and I opened Photos.\nMy iPhone is fully recognized: I gave it a name so as to avoid to confuse between all my family's iPhones. When I selected my iPhone below the Devices menu, the window of Photos stayed empty.\nThere wasn't any error message within /var/log/system.log.\nHere is a receipe which worked in my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Photos\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Select the iPhone\n\n*Eject it\n\n*Unplug the iPhone (its USB cable)\n\n*Quit iTunes\n\n*Plug the iPhone back (its USB cable)\n\n*Open Photos\nThen I saw all my iPhone 94 photos within Photos.\nI suspect this little bug is caused by the asynchronous nature of the synchronisation mechanisms between iPhone and Mac and the lack of eject button within Photos.\nMany users might be unplugging their iPhone just when one of the synchronisation agent is running, thus letting the iPhone as still connected. A sort of ghost iPhone from the MacOS point of vue. The trick with iTunes is a way to unplug it cleanly from the MacOS point of vue.\n\nA: I had the same problem: iPhone showed up but photos on the did not. I restarted the iPhone but the problem was still there. I then restarted the iMac and when Photos app opened it was back to normal.\nNote that I am not using iCloud for photos.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem EXCEPT that I selected \"never for this device\" for Dropbox. \nThis worked perfectly until today. Two days ago, I upgraded to El Capitan. Thatʻs the only thing Iʻve done differently since it worked properly last time. \n\nA: It finally worked for me, after I went on to the APP STORE, checked for updates, and updated my MAC to 10.11.1 \n", "Q: Does \"Erase and Sync\" remove photos taken on the phone? I don't use iCloud, and I don't want to use iCloud. I see several other questions regarding contacts and settings, but Erase and Sync seems scary for me because I don't want to sync all of my photos, well, anywhere.\nI reformatted my computer and now iTunes is telling me I need to erase and sync in order to put new music on it. I've already taken loads of photos and I'm afraid those will be erased if I do Erase and Sync. I'm trying to sync music before I take my flight and don't have time to sync all of my photos\nDoes Erase and Sync delete photos that I've taken on the phone itself?\n\nA: You are right to be cautious. The erase and sync dialogue does not tell you which specific pieces of information will be erased.\nYou will want to tab through each of the places where iTunes allows you to choose synchronization and make sure that photos are not checked.\nWith that one item, you should be safe from having your photos erased, but making a back up would be a good thing to do before you allow the erasing of unenumerated anything. Also, verify that photos are included in the back up by verifying settings in iOS if you use iCloud  to do the backup. \n\nHere's the screen showing whether you have photos sync enabled or disabled. In my case, the iCloud settings has eliminated the chance I could erase photos over USB via iTunes.\n", "Q: Open a terminal window in another screen on login I was wondering if there is a way to get a terminal window to open up in another screen on startup. I know you can set terminal to open on start up, but I specifically want it to open in another screen.\nI have Mac OS X 10.11.1\n\nA: You can write an AppleScript with the following statements:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set position of first window of application process \"Terminal\" to {X_VALUE, Y_VALUE}\nend tell\n\nThe first one launch the Terminal while the second one moves its window to the defined coordinates. Export the AppleScript as application and make it run automatically at startup.\n\nA: You can create a Window Group to save the configuration and layout of one or more windows to recreate them again later, and you can tell Terminal to open a specific window group at startup.\nTo create a window group, arrange terminal window(s), then choose Window > Save Windows as Group. While creating a group, you can select the “Use window group when Terminal starts” checkbox to update the Startup preference (see below).\nTo open a window group when opening Terminal, set\n\nPreferences > General > On startup, open\n\nto “Window group” and use the popup menu to choose the group you want to open (or you can set this while creating a group, as mentioned above).\nNote that if you have the system Resume feature enabled, this preference only takes effect when Terminal has no windows already open. Also, if you're unaware of Resume: you can enable it and then Terminal will automatically restore any windows that were open when you quit it. You can enable Resume by unselecting\n\nSystem Preferences > General > Close windows when quitting an app\n\nto restore open windows when reopening applications. You can also invert this behavior on an application-by-application basis by pressing the Option ⌥ modifier key when quitting an application to either close or not close the windows.\n\nA: I am not sure I understood the question.\nMy answer would be: go to the dock at the bottom of the screen, select the icon of the terminal, ctrl-click and keep the fingers on the keys! and a menu pops-up, chose option, then \"show desktop 3\"\n", "Q: Limit what a tethered iPhone internet connection can be used for I have various background services running on my Mac which use quite a lot of bandwidth: Google Drive, a couple of OneDrive sync programs, iCloud sync, Dropbox, and Backblaze for a general backup of my harddrive.\nThis is fine when I'm on a regular wifi connection, but when i tether my Mac to my iPhone I have limited data -- only 4GB per month. I'd like to be able to limit the services which can use my internet connection when that internet connection is provided by my iPhone.\nIs there a straightforward way to do this?

I'm currently running OS X 10.11.1 and find this weird thing in Notification center. So what it stand's for and how to remove if it's not necessary?\n\nA: This is part of the private CoreFollowup System Framework at\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreFollowUp.framework/Versions/A/Support/followupd\n\nThere is no documentation about it, but the header files found at (that's for iOS, but I guess the framework is the same):\nhttps://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/tree/master/PrivateFrameworks/CoreFollowUp.framework\ndon't show any evil things.\nI suppose, it's for \"following up\" on notifications posted by other applications. There is an internal database of which the statements can be grabbed from the binary. It only contains title, body, some IDs and dates. Example:\nINSERT INTO notifications (item_id, title, body, unlock_label, relevance_date, activate_action_id, dismiss_action_id, clear_action_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n\nSo, no – you should and cannot remove it.\n[EDIT]\nRegarding the icon. Some examples of system applications having that icon:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to AirDrop in Finder.\n\n*Set the setting to let 'no one' find you.\n\n*Don't send any files from iOS or other devices using AirDrop.\n\n*Restart Mac.\n\n*Gone.\n\n\nI tested this with an iMac, a Mac Mini, and a Macbook Air 13.\nAll restarted without followupd appearing any more.\nI can recommend PhotoSync app to use instead to transfer files wirelessly which avoids this problem, and works between Mac, Windows, iOS and Android devices, making it a perfect solution for wireless transfer between multiple operating systems.\nI am convinced it is AirDrop since it allows iOS devices to transfer files to OS X, because of the fact that when I AirDrop a file from my iPad or iPhone to the Mac, a notification banner and sound pops out from the right side of screen. Also, in Notification Center settings in OS X El Capitan, there is no AirDrop present to deactivate banners and sounds, and as soon as I AirDrop a file to Mac, followupd appears in the notifications again, with all settings reactivated to banners and sounds.\nHence, even if you deactivate all tick boxes in followupd, as soon as you AirDrop to Mac from another device, it is instantly reinstated.\n\n\nA: This looks like it's involved in the mechanics of notifications on a low level. My guess is that it has been there all along, but this time the developer forgot to hide it and it escaped testing.\n", "Q: How do I make Siri send text messages to a specific number? How do I make Siri send text messages to a preferred address?\nI & someone else both have iPhones, and the other person often uses Siri to send text messages to me.  I generally send text messages to them using my iPhone.  Sometimes, however, I will use my Apple ID to send the message using the Messages app on my Mac (OS X 10.8.5), as it is often more convenient to type or send images from a personal computer than on a phone.\nThe problem is that when the other person tells Siri to send me a text message, it will send it to whichever address I sent a message from last.  This is problematic, since I will often not see a message until significantly later, as I am often not at my computer.\nIs there a way to configure the person's iPhone to have Siri only send messages to my phone?  If not, is there a different solution I could use (short of not using my computer to send the message) to prevent this situation?\n\nA: These settings can be harmonized so that no matter how the sender responds, you receive your message on any of your devices including your Mac.\nFor complete details on setting up Messages for all your devices, see this Apple Support article.\niOS - Settings\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings in iOS and select Messages\n\n*Scroll to the Send & Receive setting and select it (tap)\n\n*Here you can add email addresses associated with your Apple ID\n\nMac Settings\n\n*\n\n*Open Messages app\n\n*Select Preferences... from the Messages Menu\n\n*Under the Accounts tab, add email addresses where you can be reached at on your Mac\n\nIf your phone number is missing:\nIf your phone number is missing from your Mac Sign out of iMessage and FaceTime on your Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Messages > Preferences > Accounts.\n\n*Click iMessage in the left column, then click Sign Out.\n\n*Go to FaceTime > Preferences.\n\n*Select your Apple ID, then click Sign Out.\n\nSign back in to iMessage and FaceTime on your Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Messages > Preferences > Accounts. Click iMessage in the left column, then enter your Apple ID and Password to sign in.\n\n*Go to FaceTime, then enter your Apple ID and password to sign in.\n\nWith these properly set, you should be able to see and respond to messages no matter what account they are sent to.  Siri will not even notice a difference.\n\n\nA: Not directly. Siri just uses the contacts app, and when you send a message to a contact - iMessage is preferred.\nYou could edit those contacts to only have the SMS number or make a \"shadow\" contact changing one of the person's name to SMS and only include their phone number.\nFor instance if you texted me, you could make my first name SMS and my last name mike. \"Siri - send a message to SMS mike\" should work to pick that method of delivery if you didn't mind the setup work and the cognitive load of remembering to prefix/append a contact's name as SMS.\n", "Q: Where did the \"favorites\" tab go? \nNormally there is a \"favorites\" tab on the left side where I can easily navigate from folder to folder...where did it go?

When somebody else uses my laptop, he can of course see all the windows I have currently open. I'm looking for a mode, which allows me to completely hide some windows but without closing them.\nThis could be useful if you have your private email and Facebook always opened in a browser window, but you don't want that coworkers could accidentally or intentionally open them when they do something at your laptop.\nI'm not thinking about situations when somebody really wants to spy. I think about situations when - for example - a coworker explains you something at your laptop and you don't want him to accidentally see your private mails when he - for example - switches into the browser. \n\nA: You could use something like GhostTile for this. It is paid app though. It allows you hide applications from Dock, Cmd+Tab, Force Quit Applications, etc. You can configure system-wide shortcut key to make the hidden apps visible.\n\n", "Q: Operation not permitted \"sudo ditto -v to folder /usr/bin\" I'm trying to copy an exec file from my downloads folder to /usr/bin/ using sudo ditto -v sweep /usr/bin/sweep, but the command always fails in Terminal. I even tried to manually drag and drop it but the folder only has permissions for the system account. Is there a way I can change my command to allow permissions to this folder so that I can copy the file?.\nI'm using OS X 10.11.1\n\nA: The folder /usr/bin/ is (like other system folders in El Capitan) protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection).\nYou may either boot to Recovery Mode, disable System Integrity Protection with csrutil disable entered in Terminal.app and after rebooting copy the executable or use the folder /usr/local/bin instead. You may have to adjust your path in the latter case.\n", "Q: How to restart the Dock without using the command line? I know that I can restart the Dock using a killall Dock on the command line. I can also restart the Finder by Alt-right-clicking the Finder icon. Is there a similar way to restart the Dock without using the command line?\n\nA: No - the dock doesn't participate in the Force Quit window so you can't get at it directly.\nYou could easily take your AppleScript or shell script and wrap it in a launcher. Platypus app is my choice, but Automator also works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Make a new app\n\n*Call it Dock Killer\n\n*Add one item to the recipe - Run Shell Script\n\n*enter killall Dock\n\n*Save the App to wherever you wish.\n\n\nNow you can use Spotlight, Launchpad, FastScripts or any other manner of automation tools to use the keyboard or shortcut keys to launch your Dock Killer app. The free apps will work just fine, but I prefer LaunchBar for this task.\n\nA: Modify the file named 'Info.plist' inside the application's package (i.e. /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/). Open this file in your favorite text editor and change the following section \n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>true</string>\n\nto\n<key>LSUIElement</key>\n<string>false</string>\n\nAfter killing the Dock.app once with the Terminal/Activity Monitor (see Gordon's answer ;-)) or after a restart the app \"Dock\" appears in the Dock itself and you can force quit/restart it there or from the Apple menu -> Force quit....\nAfter a system update or upgrade you may have to repeat the edit.\n\nA: [Very] Similar to @bmike 's existing answer, but this is my preferred method for making quick Automator scripts key-commandable…\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator\n\n*Make a new Service\n\n*Call it [whatever you like] or 'killall Dock'\n\n*Add one item to the recipe - Run Shell Script\n\n*enter killall Dock\n\n*Save using  Cmd ⌘   S  [You can wait until this point to name it if you wish.

Just find the Dock process (either sort the process list by name, or use the search field in the upper right), select it, then click the Quit button (the icon is an \"X\" in an octagon) in the upper left of the Activity Monitor window. It'll ask if you want to do a normal Quit or Force Quit.\n\nA: Why dont you use the free \"Onyx\" utility (@ Titanium software); a very serious one.\nGo to 'parameters\" menu where you'll find the \"Dock\" tab… That's it / \nhttp://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2014 not booting after El Capitan 10.11 update I seem to be having this weird issue where my MacBook won't boot up after installing the OS X 10.11, El Capitan, update. \nIt goes to the login screen and once I login the bar freezes and I can't go further. \nI have tried doing an over the top reinstall and that seems to have done nothing. \nI have repaired permission (first aid) in disk utility and that seems to have done nothing. \nI am more than happy to do a clean restore. But is there ANY WAY for me to get my data out?\nPlease. If anybody could help me id appreciate it. \n\nA: Yes - you have many options to back up a Mac that won't start.\n\n\n*\n\n*you can start the Mac in Target Disk mode and connect it to another Mac to do the backup. \n\n*you can bring a USB drive and use internet recovery to install a working OS on to the new drive.

I want a list of apps that I can re-order, so the apps using the most data are at the top of the list. Is there an app that does this? My Data Manager doesn't seem to (although it is great for other things).\n\nA: Since version 4.3.0 of \"My Data Manager\" (see screenshot) that app does not track usage based on which app that use the data. According to the version description it was due to a change in the App Store guidelines.\nIf \"My Data Manager\" had to remove the feature I assume that all other apps also have to remove it.\nIf I remember correctly it was something about not showing other developers apps in your own app, but I could be wrong.  \n\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can install CellularUsageOrder which will make the list of apps in Settings much more useful by sorting it by usage rather than alphabetically.\n\nA: Settings->cellular->cellular data usage->use cellular data for\n", "Q: Workaround for wrong HID usage descriptor sent by Bluetooth Gamepad? I am investigating an incompatibility of some Bluetooth Gamepads with OSX:\nI have a Bluetooth Gamepad (NES30 Pro). The problem is that if I connect it over bluetooth, it does not work properly under OSX. I already have found the cause and have informed the manufacturer, and they promised to look into fixing that. However meanwhile I would like to find a workaround.\nThe cause of the problem is that the Gamepad does not send a proper HID usage descriptor when it is connected via Bluetooth. The Gamepad should send a HID usage descriptor that signals that it is a gamepad. However it sends a HID usage descriptor that signals that it is a compound device of Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad at the same time.\nFor illustration, this is a screenshot of the Windows device manager, showing that the Gamepad acts as several device types at once.\n\nWindows and Linux simply create 3 devices, one keyboard device, one mouse device and one gamepad device. However OSX creates just one device which contains all the functionality at once, which most programmes fail to recognize as a Gamepad. So far the only App that could show me that position data of the Analog axes and of the gamepad buttons is indeed transmitted is the HID explorer app by apple (http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/samplecode/HID_Explorer/HID_Explorer.zip) \nNow I am looking for a workaround on OSX. Some Linux systems have a problem as well with the wron HID usage descriptor. However they usually can fix it by setting a udev rule that specifically tells the system to treat the device as gamepad/joystick, for example like that:\n# 8Bitdo SFC30 GamePad Bluetooth mode(START)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"8Bitdo SFC30 GamePad\", MODE=\"0666\", ENV{ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK}=\"1\"\n\nOf course OSX does not have udev. Does anybody know how to tell/force OSX to treat an input device as a joystick/gamepad? Or maybe how to create a virtual gamepad device which takes its input from the axes/buttons of the keyboard/mouse/gamepad compound device? Or any other ideas how to tackle that problem?\nNote: I am especially interested in using the analog sticks. So just mapping them to keyboard buttons is not an option. (The gamepad already has a special mode to do that on its own. However then the analog sticks of course do not work.)\n\nA: I'd look at either getting some software to reproduce what the windows drivers do or look at hardware that has drivers for OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://joystickmapper.com/\n\n*http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/\nAlso, on OS X, the games you are looking to use need to also support looking for wireless controllers, so that might be an issue for you as well that needs to be overcome.\n", "Q: Disabling desktop switching animation on El Capitan On Yosemite I used totalspaces to modify this behaviour as well as having a grid layout...

I hook it up via the dock connector.\nI noticed that when it's hooked up to my car stereo via the dock connector, I'm locked out of the user interface: the screen doesn't show anything about the song being played, I can't pause or fast-forward or play from the iPod's buttons, and I can't navigate to select another album and start playing it.\nIn contrast, when using the iPod to play music through headphones (not connected to my car), I can play a song.  While the song is playing, I can navigate through my other albums, select a new album, and press play on the other album to switch to that one.  But I can't do this when it is connected to my car.\nI don't have this problem with an iPhone 4: even with the iPhone 4 connected to the car stereo via dock connector, I can pause playback or navigate to another album and start playing it from the phone's touchscreen.\nIs this problem specific to the 1st Generation iPod nano?

How can I identify which devices will or won't have this problem, short of buying it and trying it out?\n(I don't want to use a 1/8\" to 1/8\" cable via the headphone jack, or a FM transmitter.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no way that I'm aware of around this—the reasoning being that you should have your eyes on the road, I suppose. However, if your stereo is intelligent enough to directly read music from your iPod, as it seems to be, you can usually navigate through your music with its interface.

I occasionally see the standard OS dialog stating something like \"Application-so-and-so wants to make changes to your system.  Enter Administrator credentials to authorize.\"\nHow would I find out exactly what resources the application wants to gain elevated write access to?\nRelated to that, which process opens that dialog?\n\nA: It is not possible to know at the time the credentials are requested. The security mechanisms in OS X do not require pre-authorization of specific actions.\nApplications and other processes are asking for one or more authorization rights. Each right grants the application specific capabilities:\n\nAuthorisation Rights\nAuthorisation rights are a core part of Mac OS X's security. Rights determine who can and can not access specific functionality. Administrators of Macs often need to change the defaults that ship with Mac OS X.\n\nUse Console.app to view the /var/log/authd.log. This log file contains every successful and unsuccessful attempt to gain these rights.\nIf granted, the application is then free to perform actions with this new raised level of authorisation. Occasionally the actions are also logged in the authd.log file.\nUser Interface\nThe process responsible for showing the security user interface is part of OS X and not part of the requesting application. The application is likely in /System/Library/CoreServices. \nThe requesting application does not and can not access the credentials interface.\nLimits of Time, Use, or Both\nOS X's rights are often limited by time or use. As an example, the authenticate-admin-30 right is limited to 30 minutes. Other actions are limited to a single use; such as launching an assisting process just once.\nAs OS X has been developed, Apple have tended towards restricting initial rights. With OS X 10.11, even root the once super user has been limited by default. All with the aim of better layering security.\n", "Q: How can I stream tv shows on my iPhone 5s (without downloading)? I've looked everywhere for an answer to my question but I can't seem to find one:\nI'm trying to watch a tv show on my iPhone 5s that I bought on my account via the computer. However, the only way it lets me watch them by downloading the episodes, and I want to just stream them on my iPhone because downloads use too much data. How do I fix this problem? Is it possible to stream tv shows on your iPhone?\n\nA: Instal FileBrowser App connect it to your computer using the same network and yhen you can stream it on your iPhone by selecting the file\n\nA: I'm sure there is an answer for stuff downloaded from iTunes, but since you didn't specify, then the standard solution you are looking for is PLEX MEDIA SERVER -- https://plex.tv.\nThey offer a Plex Pass, which you have to pay for in order to receive extra features, but I believe the free version has everything you need.\nSetup the media server on your home computer.  You can even setup a NAT port on your router to access it externally, and it can either support authentication via Plex Pass or there is a hackish script somewhere on Github that allows authentication without having to purchase a Plex Pass subscription.\nThen download the app on your smart phone, and you will be able to stream all of your downloaded movies that you are sharing from your Plex Media Server.  I do this all the time, and it works perfectly.  It supports transcoding on-the-fly, so you never have to worry about buffering and such.\nXBMC, which is called something else now, is also an alternative, as well as OpenElec.  I've done my research though, and Plex is the definitely the most full-featured of them all.\nThe setup is even simpler if you only plan to watch on your own wireless network and not over the Internet.  Your mobile app (or smart TV) can find the server on its own, and it's pretty much set it and forget it.\nThere are multiple apps that you can download for Plex as well that integrate with Couch Potato, Sickbeard, etc.  I do this all the time for my kids in the morning when I'm making their breakfast and they want to watch something that's not OnDemand or DVR.  I just have all of their favorite shows downloaded to a folder on a Mac Mini running Plex Media Server.\nI fire up the app on the iPad and get a few minutes of morning peace and quiet while getting breakfast ready.  It's pretty much perfect in all aspects.\nAlso, to answer your question in regards to using data, if you stream over your wireless network, you will not use any additional mobile data, as long as your mobile device is connected to WiFi.\nI know your question is regarding watching on your mobile device, but here's some additional helpful info for other users:\nIt should be known, that not all smart TV apps offer full integration with the free version of Plex.  For instance, my parents Samsung smart TV has full Plex app integration, no problem (as does Google Chromecast).  However, my Vizio smart TV requires a Plex Pass subscription in order for the app to even work at all.\n", "Q: Applescript Access Variables Through Run Script Let's say I have a script:\nset hi to 7\nrun script \"display dialog hi\"\n\nWhen I run it, it says that hi is undefined.\nIs there a way to make hi accessible from the run script command? If not, what else can I do? The real application for this is to change a variable name. What I do now is:\n    repeat (random number from 0 to 5) times\n    set rand2 to (random number from 0 to 7) + 97\n    set rand to (random number from 0 to 7) + 97\n    set switch to rand2\n    run script (\"set \" & (ASCII character rand) & \"1 to \" & (ASCII character rand2) & \"1\")\n    run script (\"set \" & (ASCII character rand2) & \"1 to \" & (ASCII character switch) & \"1\")\n    run script (\"set \" & (ASCII character rand) & \"2 to \" & (ASCII character rand2) & \"2\")\n    run script (\"set \" & (ASCII character rand2) & \"2 to \" & (ASCII character switch) & \"2\")\nend repeat\n\nBut that doesn't work.

It would return a list of results from the variables. However, this/your script doesn't work because you're assigning rand+1 to rand2+1, before the variable rand2+1 has been assigned.

Following these instructions (see also Apple's developer documentation and BoltClock's answer to Test iOS app on device without apple developer program or jailbreak), I was able to compile an iOS app (in this case provenance, a video game console emulator app which doesn't meet Apple's guidelines and will never be allowed in Apple's App Store) in Xcode 7, sign it with my personal iCloud account, sideload it onto my iPhone (by plugging it into my Mac by USB, and selecting my iPhone in xcode menu -> Product -> Destination), and allow my phone to execute it by \"trusting\" apps with this signature in Settings -> General -> Profile, which installs the certificate associated to my icloud account onto the device.\nI would like to replicate these steps with an over the air download. Can I get Xcode to produce an executable that I can share with my brother, who has an iPhone, but does not have access to a Mac with Xcode?\nThe StackExchange Network accomplished something like this apparently for its iOS app beta program, by using Apple's enterprise distribution via Mobile Device Management, as mentioned in this question. There is also the BuildStore (http://builds.io/), which for $10/year also enables this functionality, apparently by adding users to a \"developer team\" associated to a paid Apple Developer Program account (see Apple dev docs). With Xcode 7, is it possible to do such a thing without an enterprise or even regular paid developer account?\nupdate:\nThanks to Stacksza's help, I have made some progress, which I will summarize here.\n\n\n*\n\n*XCode will create an archive (Product -> Archive), but it does not allow you to export an archive to to an .ipa file for ad hoc distribution without subscribing to the paid ADP account tier.\n\n*No problem though, because the command line xcode tool does create an .ipa executable, even with no paid ADP account. Use a command like xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath Provenance-Release\\ 11-20-15\\,\\ 22.24.xcarchive/ -exportOptionsPlist ~/manifest.plist -exportPath ~/Provenance (see Khawar's answer at How to create ipa in xcode 6 without Apple Developer account?)\n\n*But this command requires you to specify a manifest .plist file. The answer by Razvan at Over The Air (OTA) iOS IPA File Distribution For Public? contains a sample manifest.plist, as well as instructions for the hyperlink format necessary for providing a download link, which must be hosted on an SSL webpage. Might be that the SSL URL must math the app's bundle id, I'm not sure.\n\n*But the above only works if the app is provisioned for the device which downloads it, and the device has already installed the developer certificate. So for instance a device which has previously been connected via USB to my Xcode can now download the app over the air, which is great. This is progress. But for clean devices, I get the error Could not install embedded profile: 0xe8008012 (This provisioning profile cannot be installed on this device.) (as viewed in the device's console, which can be viewed in Xcode -> Window -> Devices, or else in the Apple Configurator app).\n\n*For an app to be provisioned for a device, it needs to contain the device's UDID in the embedded.mobileprovision file, see How Do You Embed a Provisioning Profile in an iOS App, How to automate checking a field in an ipa's embedded.mobileprovision?, How to find out what profile was used for building *.ipa file?, and Is there a way to see what UDID are included in a build?. You cannot just edit this file to add the UDID, however, because then the CODESIGNATURE of the app doesn't match, and the device will report the error Failed to verify code signature of /private/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.7jBjpk‌​/extracted/Payload/Provenance.app : 0xe8008017 (A signed resource has been added, modified, or deleted.)}\n\n*Ok, so we need to resign the app. Xcode provides a commandline tool called codesign which can do this. Instructions are at How to re-sign the ipa file? and Re-sign IPA (iPhone) and Resign an iPhone App, insert new Bundle ID and send to Xcode Organizer for Upload and How to manually re-sign an IPA with a new provisioning profile. I had to specify my developer certificate, the precise name of which can be found in Keychain Access, under the Certificates tab, and looks like \"iPhone Developer: username@mac.com (ABCDEFGHIJ)\". Then the command is like codesign -f -s \"iPhone Developer: username@mac.com (ABCDEFGHIJ)\" Payload/Provenance.app. The example commands in the instructions above included a flag called --resource-rules, but I found no such file in my compiled app, so I removed that flag. I wonder what it does, and whether it is necessary. Edit: The excellent blog post Inside Code Signing by Thomas Kollbach explains that the --resource-rules flag used to be used to state which parts of an app must be signed, but since iOS8 is deprecated, and the entire app must be signed.\n\n*Now that the app has the UDID added and is signed, downloading it on the fresh device gives the errors Could not install embedded profile: 0xe8008003 (This provisioning profile is malformed and A valid provisioning profile for this executable was not found. My guess it the problem now is that the device still has not installed the developer certificate. When sideloading via Xcode, before the app will execute, you have to find the installed certificate in Settings -> General -> Profile, select your certificate and tap \"trust\". However this option does not appear after the over-the-air download of the ad hoc app, so I am unsure how to proceed. I think I need some way to install the developer certificate on the device. According to Installing provisioning profile on iOS 8.0.2, it used to be possible by simply emailing the certificate to the device, but that no longer works as of iOS 8. I have not tried to confirm. How can I install my developer certificate onto an iOS device remotely?\n\n*I tried exporting my iPhone developer certificate from Keychain Access, and emailing it to the device. The device was able to install the certificate, but it displayed with a red warning that it was not signed, whereas when the cert was installed via Xcode/USB had no such warning. According to Rhythmic Fistman at is possible to re-encrypt an embedded.mobileprovision file?, the profile must be signed by Apple to work. This may be the sticking point. Apple will only sign your cert if you have a paid ADP account.\n\n*This blog post on provisioning by Sean Heber was very illuminating about the general theory of developer certificates and provisioning profiles (along with Kollbach's they should both should be required reading). It contains this paragraph:\n\n\nThe reason all of this works and is secure is that Apple generates the provisioning profiles in the portal and then signs them with their own private keys before delivering them to you. The signing of the provisioning profiles is something only Apple can do. The file you download can therefore not be tampered with without rendering it invalid. An invalid provisioning profile will not be accepted by iOS and thus Apple can control exactly what can and cannot be provisioned by a developer by simply restricting access to the signing of the provisioning profile to things the the developer portal gives you permission to configure in the first place - even though provisioning profiles can support any number of other awesome options you can’t use without jailbreaking. This is why you have to register testing devices in the portal, add your certificates to the portal, etc - only things in the portal (and thus the numbers of which can be controlled and limited arbitrary by Apple) can be included in a generated and properly signed provisioning profile. The portal is where Apple’s provisioning policies and limitations are actually enforced.\n\nThis seems to definitively answer my question (can I get the app to run without a paid ADP account) with a \"no\". Although this article predates Xcode 7. Apparently Xcode 7 will send a device's UDID to the Apple portal, and receive in response a provisioning profile signed by Apple, containing that UDID. Xcode 7 only does this when the device is plugged in via USB and recognized by Xcode, but one wonders whether a manual Xcode request to Apple could be crafted? That gets deeper into reverse engineering Apple's stuff than I'm comfortable with, and probably violates ToS or whatever, so I think I'm satisfied with the \"no\" answer.\nAccording to the about page for BuildStore, they manage something similiar via email, so it may be possible.\nXcode “Build and Archive” from command line is quite old (circa xcode 3), but suggests using xcrun instead of xcodebuild which I've been using.\n\nA: The answer is almost YES!\nI managed to install new builds of the same app on the devices via Fabric.io without apple dev subscription.\n(I guess you can also distribute them with iTunes. Send ipa to tester, and it should be able to install it via iTunes.)\nThe only disadvantage is that you have to connect the device to Xcode at least once. Then you can remotely install new versions.\n(I didn't find the way to do it manually knowing the udid)\nWhen you connect the \"unknown\" device to xcode 7, there is a fix issue button in Target general settings. Fix the issue and Xcode will generate a new Provisioning profile with this device included. (you can find it in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles)\nThan you can use this provisioning profile to distribute apps via Fabric.io\n\n\n*\n\n*Signup on Fabric.io\n\n*Setup Fabric for your project (there is a step by step guide)\n\n*Make sure that xcode uses right prov. profile to sign it. Automatic worked for me.\n\n*Xcode>project>archive\n\n*fabric helper will detect the build and you will be able to distribute it.\n\n\nSorry guys who are not proficient enough with Xcode, I don't have much time to add less error prone guide, but I hope this answer will help somebody with ideas.\nTIP: use this quicklook plugin to see inside ipas and prov. profiles!\n\nA: As of some version of iOS 9.x released since my answer was originally posted, this is no longer even a possibility. Apple now restricts OTA downloads to non-free accounts, as shown by errors in the device logs upon the install failing.\nI have tested this extensively, as this would be amazing for my apps too.\nCan I distribute my apps OTA without a Developer Program Membership (costs money)?\nYou can create and sign an IPA and create the Manifest file for it, but it will fail to install on the device. The reason for this is Xcode needs to configure the IPA for that device (supposedly signing it properly with the UDID). You can even see this happen if you try to plug in a new device to the Mac and run your app via Xcode on it. The short answer is no.\nWhat can I do to make this work?\nYou can sign up for the Developer Program with Apple (costs money) and add the UDID of his device to your profile, then create an IPA and manifest file, upload them to a web server and send him the URL.\nIt really is for security, as the price barrier is usually what stops malicious apps from being distributed over the web. Not to mention keeping the majority of app downloads in the App Store.\nI've signed up for the developer program? How do I distribute it now?\nYou must have a HTTPS web server (and a SSL certificate which you can make your own root for). You also must have added their UDID to your Developer profile (I'm not exactly sure how to do this). You must use Xcode to create the IPA (Product > Archive > Export > Save for Ad-hoc Deployment > Sign in with Apple ID > Follow instructions) and you will get a Plist and an IPA file. Put those both on your server and change the values in the Plist file to match the HTTPS URLs on your server. Then you use a special link to link to the Plist manifest, and it will pop up asking the user to install your app. If everything goes right, the user will have your app. You also have to code your own update method if you want that.\nIf this is an app you want to distribute at this point, it might make more sense to actually put it on the App Store, or if this is for beta testing use TestFlight. If you have a developer account you can use TestFlight and skip all of this stuff for app testing. All you need is their email and to get them to install the TestFlight app from the App Store. TestFlight can be managed from iTunes Connect.\n\nA: Basically, someone has to sign the app. You can get the IPA file, but it won't run on arbitrary devices. Focus on that and you'll quickly decide if you want to endure the hassle of each person using Xcode or if paying for Apple to sign your apps makes sense.\nIf you are relying on iOS 9 non-developer signing with any old Apple ID, your testers all need to sign in with your Apple ID to run the app. \nYou can pay for Apple to handle the accounts and signing by paying for a year of developer accounts. Then you can email, pop the app on any server, use TestFlight or all over easier for you methods other than handing out your Apple ID to your testers / users of the app. \nYou can always send the source code to your brother if he has Xcode, but you mentioned that was the point of not having someone have a Mac to install and sign the app. \nJail breaking is easier than forging Apple's certificate chain, but I don't recommend that. \n", "Q: Need some advice/solutions on having 2 external displays set up I have a 2015 13\" Retina MacBook Pro that comes with 2 Thunderbolt ports and an HDMI port.\nI have 2 monitors which have same resolution (1920x1080) and same size, and they also only have DVI and VGA ports (no HDMI ports on both monitors).\nI have already connected one of the monitors to my rMBP via a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adaptor. I'm looking to connect the other monitor using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adaptor.\nNow, is there any problem with using different formats of adaptor in this case? Are there any problems/obstacles to set up both external monitors using 1 VGA and 1 DVI adaptor to Mini DisplayPort?\n\nA: TL;DR;\nNo.\nLong Version:\nNope.\n\nA: HDMI and DVI are nearly identical protocols and it should take only an inexpensive passive HDMI to DVI cable to connect one display.  I would discourage the use of VGA as that is analog and will add noise and blurring to your display.  Using a mini-DP to DVI adapter will preserve a digital connection to the screen and therefore preserve the quality of the video.  Not only will using HDMI improve video quality it will leave a Thunderbolt port open for other uses.\nSo, one problem is by using VGA you are getting lower quality video.  Perhaps you won't see a problem but I've seen VGA on digital displays have problems such as not keeping the image centered, the display and adapter fail to keep synch.  Another problem, you are occupying a valuable Thunderbolt port when the empty HDMI port will drive the display just as well, perhaps better.\nIf you already have the adapters, and the VGA isn't giving problems, then what you describe will do fine.  If in the future you need that Thunderbolt port back then an $8 HDMI to DVI cable will free up that port for you.  After that just keep the VGA adapter in a drawer in case you need to bring your laptop somewhere and all they have is a VGA screen for you.\n", "Q: Should apps on iPad Pro work just like on any other iPad iPad Pro resolution size is  2732‑by‑2048. iPad air 2 resolution is 2048‑by‑1536. So if an iOS game was built specifically for all iPad's from Apple, and the app is currently out, does it mean on the new resolution iPad Pro the game app will look like it doesn't fit on the screen?\n\nA: TL;DR;\nIt depends on the app. \nMore explanation:\nMany apps that look fine on all iPhones and iPads are basically the same app. They are written that way to work on all resolutions. (It's a good programming practice not to assume anything about screen resolution of the device the program is run. It's not always possible though).\nHowever, there is the possibility that some apps don't look good on iPad Pro because developers haven't tested their apps on it.

It's still attached at the top.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I safely clean the screen under the shield?\n\n*Once I've cleaned it, how can I keep the shield from separating?\n\n\nA: To do this the risk of further damage is rather high as I had to do this before on the same Mac. You will need a heat gun to heat the edge of the screen so you can pull it off then after it is separated you will need microfiber cloths and denatured alcohol (available in the paint section of any store) to wipe the LCD and glass cover perfectly clean. After finished you can use your glue of choice to put it back together however keep in mind pretty much any glue you use will not come back off without breaking something, so there is no turning back.

I don't like how my phone lags now and the battery lasts way less then it used. Can you guys please help if there is a way I can go back to OS 8.4?\n\nA: iOS 8.4, no. iOS 9.1, yes. The reason your iPhone is lagging so much is because iOS 9.2 is beta software. iOS 9.1 is the latest public release of iOS 9 and is what you should downgrade to. Apple has instructions on their website on how to accomplish this.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (Early 2015) bluetooth issues after waking from sleep Just got a new MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015), but there are several problems with bluetooth. Most of them occur when waking from sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes the bluetooth icon shows \"Not available\". The bluetooth hardware then also doesn't show up in System Information.\n\n*Sometimes the bluetooth icon and preferences indicate that it's turned off, but nothing happens when I click \"Turn on\".\n\n\nThe only remedy for these problems is to completely restart the computer. In some cases, it hangs on the 'shutdown loading spinner', and then restarts with a kernel panic message. I attached the latest panic log below.\nI tried trashing the bluetooth preferences and resetting the SMC, but that doesn't seem to permanently fix the problems.\nCould this be a hardware issue?\n\n***

An alternative workaround to restarting is to force quit the blued process.  This can be done either through Activity Monitor or on commandline killall blued.\n\nA: I finally figured out the solution. Some bluetooth modules in the 2015 Macs have actual hardware problems. To confirm this, I ordered a replacement 2015 bluetooth module for my MBP 2015 from iFixit. My Mac kept crashing upon waking up from sleep delivering the same kernel panic message the OP had regardless of whether i put in the original 22015 BT module - or the replacement 2015 BT module from iFixit.\nMy friend gave me her bluetooth module from her 2013 MBP which looks physically different but still fits just fine in the 2015 MBP. I plugged it in and haven't had a single BT issue for nearly a week. Hope this helps. A 2013 MBP BT module is about $70 on eBay or iFixit.\nThis problem was extremely annoying and it seems multiple 2015 MBPs have it. I bought this 2015 model from my school in 2018 brand new(Apple shipped it to my school) - and it had the problem from day one. Shame on Apple for selling broken hardware 3 years after the fact.\n\nA: I reset the SMC once more and changed the Wi-Fi to 802.11n on 5Ghz, after reading that it could cause interference. This seems to have fixed the problems so far.\n\nA: Mid-2015 15\" with the same problem on High Sierra.\nMy observations and solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*It only happens when I have shut the machine off and then started it (not on restart or on wake from sleep).\n\n*Fix is to reset the SMC, sometimes have to do it twice.\nSuper annoying.\n\nA: Finally I found someone else with this issue! This has been quite a problem.\nI've worked around the \"Bluetooth Not Available\" thus far by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading \"Bluetooth Explorer\" from Apple's site (can't recall where but it was not easy to find)\n\n*When the problem occurs, open it, choose Tools > Get Local Device Info, then clicking \"Re-Enumerate USB Device\" until it comes back.\n\n\nHave just had to deal with it crashing every time I let it go to sleep for an extended period of time. Seems to be more problematic when it's on battery but also happens sometimes when plugged in.\nI'm not allowed to ask him directly for some dumb reason, but if the person given best answer could elaborate on how exactly to switch that Wi-Fi setting that'd be awesome. If it's on the router side unfortunately that won't help me, as I'm at a college campus.\n\nA: Okay I found a way to fix the sleep-crashing issues:\nSimply turn off Bluetooth before putting your computer to sleep.\nKinda annoying, but haven't had any problems since!\n", "Q: Is there a possibility to recover rewritten backup copy of an iPhone from iTunes? Is there a possibility to recover rewritten backup copy of an iPhone from iTunes?\nThe thing is, I accidentally rewrote the former backup with current and now need to get the previous one.\nPlease help, this is really important.\n\nA: Perhaps\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do an iOS upgrade via iTunes and haven't backed up the phone locally \"in a while\", iTunes will do a backup and include the date and time in the name, so it won't overwrite an existing backup. You can see these backups in Preferences… > Devices. I don't know when iTunes decides to do an automatic backup, but that's a place to look.\n\n*The backups are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup on a Mac and \\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\ on Windows 7, so if you back up that directory, you may have the desired backup on your backup device/service.\n\n\nIf you don't have the desired backup in either of those places then it's no longer available.\n\nA: If you have backed up your iPhone through iTunes your old backup will still be there. Open iTunes goto preferences then select devices and you will see all the backups you had done. Select the appropriate one and restore. Hope, this helps you\n", "Q: csrutil: command not found I am using a Mid 2012 MacBook and recently upgraded it to OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I was having trouble with it's new SIP feature and wanted to disable it.\nI tried to boot into OS X Internet Recovery using Cmd+R, which started Internet Recovery. When I tried csrutil disable in Terminal, it returned -bash: csrutil: command not found.\nThen I tried booting into Recovery HD and tried the same command in the recovery mode there to get the same error.\nMy question is how can I access csrutil command to disable SIP? Am I missing something?\nUpdate\nI am putting the recovery terminal commands I have tried in the following screenshot. Kindly zoom it to see clearly\n\n\nA: The netboot image loaded by booting to Internet Recovery Mode apparently doesn't contain the executable csrutil.\nThe OS X Base System loaded while booting to Recovery Mode should contain it though. By pressing cmdR a 2-step procedure is initiated: First the Mac is booted to Recovery HD and then after expanding BaseSystem.dmg to \"OS X Base System\" (which is the name of the mounted BaseSystem.dmg). If you see an animated globe after pressing cmdR your Mac probably doesn't have a Recovery HD.\nCheck the system version (or product version) of the Recovery HD/Base System:\nTo check the system version (1 in the screenshot below), boot to your main volume and enter the following in Terminal:\ndiskutil list #to get the disk identifier of your Recovery HD; usually it's disk0s3 with a size of ~650 MB\ndiskutil mount disk0s3\ncat /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 2 ProductVersion\n\nAdditionally you may mount BaseSystem.dmg and check the system version (2 in the screenshot below) there also:\nopen /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\ncat /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 2 ProductVersion\n\n\nDownload and reinstall the latest OS X El Capitan full installer if the system version of the base system is 10.10.x or lower.\n\nA: Late to the party but had the same problem. Solved it by, at startup, hold down the option key, ⌥, until you can choose what to boot from and then click on the recovery one, should be Recovery-\"version\". Then you can follow the same steps as earlier stated - open terminal and write csrutil disable/enable. \n\nA: When booted into recovery mode, if the following: sudo csrutil disable returns \"command not found\" try /usr/bin/csrutil disable instead\n\nA: For me it helped to do a PRAM Reset, I had rEFInd installed for dual boot. The PRAM Reset also skipped my rEFInd boot routine, but finally I could get back into normal recovery mode and not only into internet recovery.\n\nA: Use a OSX 10.11.x or later installer CD/DVD or USB.\nI had the same issue until I tried a High Sierra installer USB.\n\nA: I had the same issue. When I was trying cmd R Lion Recover mode started in my machine. So I used a pen drive with high sierra installation and it worked. After that, opened Terminal and it should be alright\n", "Q: MacBook Pro problem with screen freeze My MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2012 worked perfectly, but last days it has many lags (screen freeze with or without artifacts/shaders). After force shutdown it beeps 3 times and after approximately 10 minutes it loads OS, but fan works very noisy and fast.\nWhere can be the problem?\n\nA: I have a Macbook air mid 2012 and it still runs like it is brand new. If I were you, I would get an external, backup everything you have on there. Do an internet recovery through disk utility and it should run like its brand new! Ive had issues like this before and what I suggested has been successful for me every time. \n\nA: After 3 years of use i will suggest to perform a format. You'll get a brand new Macbook pro in hours.\n", "Q: How do I take a screenshot on Apple TV? I need to capture a screenshot of Apple TV to send a bug to a developer. How do I take a screenshot in tvOS on the new Apple TV?\n\nA: I would just snap a picture of the TV screen with a smartphone (or any other) camera and use this for the bug report.\n\nA: With the Apple TV connected to your development machine via USB:\nSteps\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Xcode from the menu select Window → Devices\n\n*Select the Apple TV on the left representing your device.\n\n*On the device, configure the screen the way you want to capture it.\n\n*Click on the Take Screenshot button.\n\n*It will save the screenshot on Desktop.\nFor reference:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-devices_organizer/articles/capture_screenshots_from_device.html\n\nA: Starting with tvOS 11 and later running on a 4th-gen Apple TV/Apple TV HD or an Apple 4K, and a Mac running macOS High Sierra 10.13 or later, you can take a screenshot of Apple TV wirelessly and without installing any app in macOS (even Xcode, or any other app for that matter).\nFollow the below steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your Apple TV and Mac are connected to the same Ethernet/Wi-Fi network.\n\n*On your Mac, launch the built-in QuickTime Player.app.\n\n*In the QuickTime Player menu bar, go to File menu → New Movie Recording or use the keyboard shortcut Option + Command + N.\n\n*This would open a Quick Time window with the Mac's camera turned on by default (if you have one connected to your Mac or if you are using a MacBook with one built-in FaceTime HD camera).\n\n*Now, click on the arrow besides the red circular Record button and select your Apple TV for Camera.\n\n\n*This would start mirroring Apple TV's screen in QuickTime Player on your Mac. The Apple TV on the connected display would start showing a think red-colored border indicating that a screen mirroring is in progress.\n\n(The above photo shows an Apple TV connected to a monitor over HDMI, and QuickTime Player.app in movie recording mode running on a MacBook Pro which is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Apple TV. The Mac and Apple TV are not physically connected to each other.)\n\n*This is how the Apple TV mirror in QuickTime Player.app on your Mac would appear.\n\n\n*Now click anywhere inside the QuickTime Player.app window to dismiss the player controls. Use the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + 4 to take a screenshot. This would change the cursor into a crosshair. \nMove the cursor over to the QuickTime Player.app window, and press Space key to highlight the window. This would further change the cursor into a camera. Now either press Enter key or left click on Mouse or Trackpad to capture the screenshot. This would save the screenshot on Desktop (or any other location configured for screen capture)\n\n\n*Voila! Your Apple TV screenshot is captured, without fiddling with cables, or installing any additional apps.\n", "Q: Sorting iBooks PDFs and eBooks I purchased an iPad mini 2 not too long ago with the intention of using it as an eReader for the various PDFs that I own.  After uploading content to my iPad I tried to sort the content into different collections to help sort PDFs into different categories.  It turns out that moving PDFs into a collection does not remove the PDF from the original collection.  This is making it difficult to sort as not only do you have to search though ones you have already sorted, you have to remember which you've already sorted.  Is there a way to \"hide\" or remove PDFs from this main collection once they belong to another collection?  If not, is there another decent eReader app available for the iPad, or should I simply return it and find another eReader entirely?\n**(Side note) It would be incredibly helpful if I could simply retain the folder structure that they are currently in, as they are already sorted and categorized on my computer.\n\nA: For handling (a lot of) PDFs, I've found GoodReader to be the much better choice than iBooks. It provides a hierarchical way of managing content (similar to a filesystem) and also allows syncing/copying of whatever structure you already have on your Mac.\n", "Q: can I have mulitple apple ID's backed up to itunes? My husband's iphone, my daughter's iphone and my iphone/ipad all have separate apple ID's - so we have 3 apple ID's in our household.  I have itunes on my laptop and pack up my ipad and iphone regularly - they both have the same apple ID and my itunes account \"knows\" one is an iphone and one is an iPad.  How do I set up my husband's and daughter's iphones to back up?  Can I add them to my existing itunes account?  do I need to download separate itunes programs on to my laptop?  how do I keep them all straight on my laptop?  and when they are backed up, where do their photos and videos go?  \n\nA: This is a very common question and really there is no correct answer. iTunes belongs to the computer so you wouldn't run into an issue with less than five different accounts and even hundreds of devices would all sync with one PC and one iTunes library. \nWhen I worked at a certain fruit stand, I would ask people to imagine for a moment sharing a sock drawer with the person(s) in question. Some people like their socks sorted by size and color or prefer them folded this way or that. Some people live on the beach where it's warm year-round and don't even need socks. Some like to keep everyone's stuff organized, others need space to do their own thing. \nThat being said, my default answer is to make each person their own user account on your computer and only connect one person's device to their account. \nThat way you can choose to share photos using a photo sharing option or share app purchases using family sharing or share music using home sharing. Throwing everything into one large pile is generally something that people regret and having things separate usually doesn't cause any practical problem whatsoever.  At worst, when you run into a practical problem, you'll have many options to solve that problem without throwing everything back together. Having things apart makes the problem clearer and the resolution smaller work to accomplish.\nPCs work with multiple user accounts just about as easily as a Mac does in my experience, so I don't see any reason to deviate from my advice to Mac users if you're using the Windows operating system and iTunes. Also, you could try mixing everything if you make good backups of all the things before trying that option.\n", "Q: Help me solve this Macbook wifi mystery We noticed this week that our Macbook wifi connection was slow. On inspection, we discovered that the wifi wasn't auto-connecting to our network, but rather one named ATT5g---.\nIf I selected our network, then went BACK to that network, it required a password to login. If I turned off our wifi and turned it back on, it would select the ATT wifi first.\nOf course, I thought, \"man in the middle\" attack? (Because I'm not really tech savvy). But it seems like it would be a bad one, as it was easily discoverable and provided the IP address. Still ...\nIn getting rid of the network as a \"preferred\" network, I noticed in the Advanced setting a slew of networks we've connected to via iPhone/iPad - like pizza joints, libraries, etc. So I started connecting some dots.\n\n\n*\n\n*ATT sounds like it's probably Uverse.\n\n*The neighbors across the street have Uverse.\n\n*My son is friends with the neighbors and connects his iPhone to their wifi when he goes over\n\n*We have iCloud keychain.\n\n*Chances are, through iCloud, the Macbook picked up on the wifi network and started automatically connecting to it.\n\n*The neighbors run a business from their house, so they likely have more than one router (hence the multiple ATT wifi networks) and a stronger, safer network.\n\n*Those routers are likely synced. (My son says he can't remember their network name and the ATT wasn't familiar. That he thinks he connects to \"linksys.\")\n\n*No other device in the house connects to that wifi (no iPads, not my Dell, etc.)\n\n\nNow, I couldn't get my son's iPhone to connect to the ATT wifi, which is a sticky in the wicket. I see the ATT wifi, but requires a password if I try to connect. But maybe because it's a specific router and not the linksys?\nDoes that make sense? Have you heard of Macbooks connecting to other wifis as a regular issue? \n\nA: This is not an issue that I have ever seen before. A Macbook automatically connecting to a secured network is something out of a science fiction book.\n As for your sons iPhone, type your subnet mask into your address bar and mess around with the settings for you WEP Key and add his iPhones mac address to your router settings. This should enable your router to talk with your sons iPhone in this case that it is not connecting.\nYou can also go ahead and remove the network from his phone by forgetting it, and re-entering the credentials for your router in again manually so it can have a fresh start at trying to get to know your sons iPhone connection. My iPhone has trouble recognizing my iPhone sometimes and adding the mac address to my router settings fixed the issue but I am more experienced with stuff like than than your average Joe so try and \"Forget This Network\" and see if that works if not, try the first option. If all else fails, give Apple a call.\n", "Q: How to install OS X 10.10 from USB? I bought a second hand MacBook, that had not had a fresh install of OS X.  The original owner's username and password are in the system. I do not know the administrator password.  I can use the Mac normally by signing in/out without asking for authentication. However when I tried to install some programs, the system asked for authentication, so I decided to reinstall the system.\nI downloaded a Mavreicks OS 10.10 from the Internet, then I made a bootable OS X on a USB thumb drive using Transmac software. I logged to my Mac in the Recovery mode booted from the USB. I then erased the main HDD partition and tried to reinstall the OS, but an error msg poped-up saying: \n\nCan't download the additional components needed to install OS X.\n\nHow can I now do a fresh install of OS X?\n\nA: Some OS software from another internet source other than Apple is not entirely reliable unless they are a certified Apple seller. In order to get back to the OS you want you can do a few things. Delete the HDD from disk utility and recover it from Internet Recovery. This should bring you to download El Capitan, after that you want to go to the app store and see if you have a version of Mavericks already downloaded, if you go great. If not, you are going to need to buy a copy and then download that onto your USB to reboot from there. Chances are, the copy of Mavericks you have is corrupt in some way or missing essential components. \n\nA: Apple's createinstallmedia tool will avoid the \"download additional components\" failure in almost all cases.\nSee How do I make a bootable USB flash drive a Mac? for a step by step guide and discussion on how to accomplish that.\nThe next real question is if your hardware supports Internet Recovery or if your recovery HD is still operational. Disconnect all external devices and see if you can get a \"reinstall OS X\" option. You might need to download and install the latest OS onto an external drive and then re-download your older installer if you don't get the option to reinstall 10.10 or lower.\n", "Q: Can I make Apple Mail use \"m\" as the \"mark unread\" hotkey? I'd like to make \"m\" the hotkey for marking emails unread, since that's the same key as every other email or RSS application uses, and command+shift+u is unwieldy. The only place I can find to set this is the global hotkeys and it won't let me use unmodified keys (presumably because that would break things). Is it possible to do this?\n\nA: You can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*click App Shortcuts and add a new shortcut using the \"+\" button\n\n*Select Mail from the list of your applications\n\n*As Menu Title, you have to put the exact name of the menu command you want to add. In your case, it should be \"As unread\"\n\n*Choose the shortcut you want\n\n*Just Add the modification\n\n\nAfter these steps, just restart Mail and it's done. You can check on the menu bar to see that the shortcut has been modified.\n", "Q: HTML5 in Safari 9.0.1 (11601.2.7.2) - `html5test.com According to html5test.com, Safari now supports HTML5. I am specifically interested in the HTML5 tag parameter required.\nHowever, when I add the required parameter to my form, Safari ignores it. I have tested the page with FireFox and it works.\nSo, does Safari support HTML5 or not?\n\nA: Safari does support HTML5 and does support form validation, however support for 'required' in Safari on OS X and iOS is 'partial'.\n\nPartial support refers to lack of notice when form with required fields is attempted to be submitted.\n\nSource: caniuse.com/#search=required\nImplementation is off-topic here, but feel free to search for solutions on Stack Overflow.\n\nA: Safari does not support this attribute, you need to use JavaScript.

I would like to use one of the sounds (.aif) that I already have stored on my computer. Changing default sounds in Calendar would be helpful to know as well. \nI've followed the steps at cultofmac previously, but tried again. My ~/Library/Sounds folder is empty. I added a newly created aiff and named that sound of my choice as basso.aiff and placed it in the empty folder. Followed the terminal instructions. But, I get no alert sound at all from Reminders. \nStrangely, alert sounds (ie notification of deleting a song from iTunes, as well as certain alerts in other apps use that aiff too.) I could careless about what sound I hear in any app other than Reminders. Suggestions? \n\nA: You were on the right lines, but the wrong location…\nSystem sounds are in /System/Library/Sounds/ it's only user sounds in ~/Library/Sounds\nReplace the Basso.aiff in there with your custom version [bearing in mind this will replace Basso in any other system alert that uses it too]  \nIt will be the same for Calendar alerts - except there you can define which system sound to use, so if you did need a separate custom sound in there you could apply the same logic to one of the other system sounds in the Library folder.\n\nNote that in El Capitan you would first have to disable System Integrity Protection before you can modify the Sounds folder…\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo appears on your screen.\n  \n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n  \n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n  \n*Restart your Mac.\n  \n  \n  Revert the same way using csrutil enable\n\n\nA: May 17, 2017 8:10 AM in response to Claude-LU\nI struggled with this for days. For me, the problem was that I REALLY didn't want to change the sound for all alerts because Basso is fine for basic system alerts. I just wanted to change it for the Calendar alerts and not for everything. Apparently some things that used to work, do not work on Sierra, but this did.\nFind a new aiff file (here are some examples http://tdwhs.nwasco.k12.or.us/staff/lewing/resources/sound_effects.htm)\nDownload the file and rename it to something like Alarm.aiff (multiple words may work, I didn't try)\nOpen the terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)\nCopy the file to ~/Library/Sounds using something like the line below (assuming you download the aiff file into your Downloads Directory)\ncp ~/Downloads/Alarm.aiff ~/Library/Sounds\nQuit iCal.\nCopy the line below into the Terminal window and press return (Match the last parameter \"Alarm\" to the name of the file you copied above)\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal 'Default alarm sound' 'Alarm'\nOpen iCal, new default alarms should now use that sound.\nThis worked for me and now I have a different alarm sound Only for iCal. If I could change the location of the notification alerts to the middle of the screen (again, for iCal only), I would be even happier.\n", "Q: Are there any differences between MacPro4,1 2009 and MacPro5,1 2010 besides firmware? I've noticed on many used MacPro listings that people have upgraded a MacPro4,1 (a.k.a. 2009) to a MacPro5,1 (a.k.a. 2010) simply by updating the firmware. From this, it appears that these machines are now able to accept 6-core Xeons as well as utilize 1333 MHz DDR3 RAM.\nWhile this sounds all great and magical, is there anything else that changed between the two revisions of the tower? I'm asking more along the lines of physical rather than software; i.e. is a 2009 model with updated firmware inferior in any way whatsoever to a 2010?\nUPDATE 2015-11-02 just to be a bit more specific, my curiosity is more around if the 4,1 and 5,1 are identical except for the upgraded firmware and new CPU/GPU options? Considering the CPU/GPU can be replaced aftermarket, I'm curious if (say) the motherboard is identical between the two revisions or were there any modifications?\n\nA: The Mactracker app (for Mac and iOS) is a great resource for questions like this. You can check out all the specs for yourself side by side, but the more significant differences are:\n4,1:\n\nProcessor:          Intel Xeon 3500 or 5500 series (\"Bloomfield, Gainestown\")\nGraphics Card:      NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 or ATI Radeon HD 4870\nGraphics Memory:    512 MB GDDR3 (GeForce GT 120) or 512 MB GDDR5\n                    (Radeon HD 4870)\nDisplay Connection: 1 - Mini DisplayPort and 1 - dual-link DVI\n\n\n5,1:\n\nProcessor:          Intel Xeon W3530, W3565, W3680, E5620, \n                    X5650, or X5670 (\"Bloomfield, Westmere,\n                    Gulftown\")\nGraphics Card:      ATI Radeon HD 5770 or ATI Radeon HD 5870\nGraphics Memory:    1 GB GDDR5\nDisplay Connection: 2 - Mini DisplayPort and 1 - dual-link DVI\n\n", "Q: How can I zoom in with Mac Mail on a message I am composing? I am familiar with the Command+ option to zoom in on text within messages received in Mac Mail.\nHowever, this command does not seem to work when composing a message.  Is there another zoom functionality so that I could avoid making the text larger while I am typing only to resize the text before I send the email?\n\nA: This isn't exactly what you want but may be a viable workaround if no one comes up with a way just to zoom the text in the composition window. In the Accessibility Preference Pane (on Yosemite, don't know if it's the same in El Capitan) there's a Zoom subpane. There you can set up various ways to zoom the whole screen. I have \"Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom\" checked and Command as the modifier, so I can hold down the command key and scroll and the screen zooms in and out.\n", "Q: Mac doesn't go into sleep mode Sometimes my mac mini doesn't go into standby after the inactivity time specified in system settings. This happened with Yosemite, and continues to happen with El Capitan.\nQuite sure, there is some application that prevents sleep, but I'm still unable to identify it. Is there a systematic way to identify the guilty application?\n\nA: From here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/11/mac-wont-sleep-heres-how-to-find-out-why-and-fix-it/\nFor other people who have this problem.\nFirst, make sure that Energy Saver is set up the way you want: choose Apple () menu > System Preferences, then click Energy Saver. Make sure the sleep setting are what you want. \nIf they are, then the most likely cause is that a process is preventing sleep mode.\nTo find out which one, go to a terminal and type:\npmset -g assertions\n\nUnder the line\nListed by owning process:\n\nyou will see a list of processes which prevent entering sleep mode, it looks something like:\nListed by owning process:\npid 59696(firefox): [0x001043b4000511a0] 259:56:59 NoDisplaySleepAssertion named: \"screen\" \npid 59706(plugin-container): [0x0017d5d700050d8b] 94:03:47 NoDisplaySleepAssertion named: \"screen\" \n\nIn this case firefox and a plugin in firefox are preventing sleep-mode, so you can kill or restart them to solve the problem. \nIf you have no processes listed, another possibility is that there is network traffic which keeps the computer awake. So check if there are processes which are continuously having network traffic (in jan d's answer, that would be the process trying to print). \n\nA: After trying everything i could find on the web, i figured out that it was a page in the (HP) printer queue that was keeping my Mac from sleeping for days. Turned on the printer, forced the page to print and my Mac is now FINALLY going back to sleep.  \nThere was no indication of this in the Activity Monitor nor the \"pmset -g assertions\" command that pointed to anything printer related. Hope this helps someone !\n\nA: Click CMD + OPTION + ESC and check for applications that you think my be running and refreshing itself in the background to try and pinpoint what is causing this issue. It should still be going to sleep regardless.\nIm not sure what your settings are, but go and check them anyways.\n- Go to System Preferences > Display\nFrom what it sounds like, you have it set to never turn off the display, here you can tell the computer when to turn the display off which will make it go to sleep.

I have a laptop and a desktop both running 10.11.1; on the laptop I found a way to set up Spaces so that CTRL-1 would take me immediately to screen 1 and similarly for all the other screens.  I rely on that convenience.  But on my desktop I am still stuck with this stupid Mission Control 2-step procedure.  I KNOW it's possible, but I have been unable to reproduce this convenience on the desktop.  Can anyone remind me how it's done?  \n\nA: Troubleshooting possibilities, assuming everything already looks OK re JM's answer...\n\n\n*\n\n*On a keyboard with a 10-key pad, the 10-key & qwerty numbers are separate controls. The default key commands use qwerty so you need to change them specifically to 10-key if that's what you use. \n\n\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Secondly, though the commands are added with each new Space, they are not enabled by default. \n\n*Thirdly - if you have only the same number of Spaces as you have monitors - and also \"Displays have separate Spaces\" in Prefs > Mission Control - then Switching cannot work until you add one more Space\n\n*Another possibility, courtesy of Avram [which I cannot test as I don't have anything to 'swipe' on]  \n\nI believe this state occurs when you inadvertently make a swipe gesture while a ctrl-key is held down. I can't be sure of that, but the fix is to do exactly that: hold down the ctrl-key, and then do the desktop-switching swipe gesture (for me it is 3-finger swipe left or right).\n\n\nA: You can enable this feature in the \"Keyboard\" preference pane.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences (e.g., from the Apple menu)\n\n*Click on the \"Keyboard\" preference pane\n\n*Go to the \"Shortcuts\" tab\n\n*Choose \"Mission Control\" from the menu on the left\n\n*Look in the box on the right for \"Switch to Desktop 1\"\n\n*Enable the feature by \"checking\" the check box\n\n*Be sure that the keyboard shortcut is \"^1\" (\"^\" means Control)\n\n\nIf you only have one desktop right now, then you will only see \"Switch to Desktop 1\", but by placing a checkmark in the box, the feature will be enabled as you add new desktops. \n\n\nA: Here's another approach you may find useful; it's been my favorite for years, as it makes for an easy reach, one-handed keyboard shortcut (hotkey trick), to switch between spaces/desktops: Alt. + Arrow key \nStarting from the second screenshot above (or below depending how the post is uploaded) of the System Preference window for Keyboard:\n1) Select Shortcuts, then\n2) Notice just below the \"Keyboard Text Shortcuts Input Sources\" menu, that it reads: To change a shortcut, select it, click the key combination, and then type the new keys.\n3) Select \"Move left a Space\" / \"Move right a Space\"\n4) Click/tap on the default symbols (i.e., the default shortcut that requires two hands) Ctrl + Arrow, and simply type in \"Alt + Arrow\" and viola = a one handed keyboard shortcut to switch between spaces.\nI realize, a three finger swipe on the trackpad works too, and I love the trackpad, but I prefer keyboard shortcuts where they can be created/applied.\nLastly, I believe this will work on all Apple keyboards, laptop and desktops alike, at least it has on all five in our house (2 MBooks, 1 Air, 2 iMacs).\n\nA: Went hunting for this myself today, looks like control ◀ and control▶ do the job.\n\nA: Here is another solution. There is this tool out there called \"rcmd\".\nrcmd is an application which can help you to focus (which just means \"swipe\" to that application). It can be used on desktops (apps not full-screened or apps full-screened. It allows you to go to applications using a hotkey. Since spaces are just comprised of one application, I think this is a suitable application for you and my needs.\nLink: https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd/\nHowever, macOS (by default) rearranges the spaces everytime you shift to a new application using a hotkey, which is annoying. Fortunately, there is an option to disable this. Uncheck the option boxed up in red.\nThere you go!

It is the same mouse I normally use in OS X on the same computer.\nAny idea why I can't connect that particular device in the Bootcamp Windows 10 version? What could I try to make bluetooth recognize the mouse or troubleshoot why it isn't?\nSo far I've once used the Bootcamp Driver download an made a fresh setup install of Bootcamp. \nEdit: In addition to this, I've tested and also another Logitech bluetooth mouse can't be found either via the bluetooth assistant.\n\nA: Turns out this was not an issue with the Bootcamp installation or its drivers. I did not know you had to hold the power botton of the mouse to make it pair. So in order to get it to work, go to Bluetooth, turn Bluetooth on, turn mouse on, hold power button pressed, the mouse will then show up under Bluetooth devices, then pair it.\n", "Q: How to deactivate ALL transitions/fades/motions in iOS 9?

With the Overcast podcast app (from Marco Arment), is there a way to play episodes within a single podcast from oldest to newest?  The default iOS podcast app does this, but I prefer the other features of Overcast.  I just don't see any way to do this.\n\nA: I was looking for this also and stumbled on a solution. In the podcast playlist, tap on the UNPLAYED or ALL toggle to reverse the sort order of the feed. So you would tap it once to sort episodes from oldest to newest, then episodes will play from the top of the feed i.e. Oldest to newest\n\n\nA: As of today - Overcast users can create a new Playlist and include any (or all) podcasts. Within this new playlist they can sort and prioritize as they want. It took me less than a minute to set this up, after I did 30 minutes of research online.

I have to quit the app store app or reboot my phone to get it back to the update button (even if I try pressing the swirly circle, it does not change).\nI've tried a hard reset, tried deleting any recently added apps. Some apps I'm unable to delete, because they appear to be in a transitional state (partially greyed out, like they're downloading or updating) and, I cannot see any third party apps when I go into settings, manage storage - it loads all the native apps, then appears to be in the process of loading the rest, but never continues. It shows i have 2.5gb available memory, so I should be able to at least update some apps, unless that figure is not correctly representing everything on my phone. \nI'm running iOS 9.0 and am extremely apprehensive about updating, because my phone was bricked for two days when i updated it to 9.0. I have an iPad air 2,which i had no trouble updating to 9.0, and am experiencing no issues with now - I'm able to update and download apps fine. And yes, I did log out of the iTunes app store, then back in, but it made no difference. I've not connected it to iTunes on my computer, because I'm currently servicing my pc. \nAny ideas? I've tried everything i can think of. \n\nA: It seems you're in a tight spot and have a pretty tight knot tied up with some really solid thinking.\nLet's unravel things a bit. Get out a piece of paper and start writing times and limiting things you change to one at a time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the phone in airplane mode and power it off. (note what you did and the time)\n\n*Power it on while disconnected and go delete all the apps that are stuck that you can afford to lose and re-download. (keep writing times and actions :-)\n\n*Check your storage usage and make sure each app gives you a number. If you can't get the usage numbers to paint while in AirPlane mode, start deleting things that take a lot of space. Movies, songs you can re-download until the device is working.\n\n*If you can't get it to a sane place in AirPlane mode, consider a call to AppleCare or just getting a backup to iTunes and wiping the device.\n\n\nIf you can resolve the transitory apps and get things working, go ahead and re-connect to the network and see if you can let the rest of the apps download. If so, proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off all background refresh in settings > general\n\n*Turn off Handoff (same place - higher up)\n\n*Set the time wrong - about 4 minutes in the past\n\n*Enable automatic time setting and verify that it returns to the correct time\n\n*Reset network settings (which will clear up several things and perform a minimal restart)\n\n*Pick one app that's small. Clicker is a good one Try downloading it.\n\n*If that fails, sign out of the App Store and power off the phone\n\n*Start the phone and try to download Clicker again.\n\n\nIf that fails, Apple support might be needed to assist. You could try changing your network (use LTE or cellular data if you're on WiFi now) or change WiFi to another location.

It is a very bizarre issue that I do not understand why is happening and I do not know how to fix.\nHere's the scenario: My Mac's user name is andyibanez. I am also the owner of https://www.andyibanez.com. I want to configure my website to use a different subdomain for FTP, SSH, and all those goodies, called ftp, so my ftp host will be ftp.andyibanez.com. So I created the DNS settings and tried to use them.\nHere's the weird thing, though: When I open the Terminal app and type ssh andyibanez@ftp.andyibanez.com, the operation fails immediately, it doesn't even try to connect to the internet. I know it doesn't because it fails as soon as I send the command by pressing the Enter key.\nssh: Could not resolve hostname ftp.andyibanez.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nAll apps I have tried to use SSH and FTP have failed immediately. That includes Cyberduck and Transmit.\nTrying to ping ftp.andyibanez.com doesn't work, either.\nping: cannot resolve ftp.andyibanez.com: Unknown host\n\nAt this point you may be thinking that I have misconfigured my DNS settings. Nope, I am 100% I didn't, for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*All operations in regarding that host fail immediately.\n\n*I have actually tried a different computer (that doesn't have andyibanez as a user) and it worked fine. I was also able to connect fine using the Transmit iOS app.\n\n*I set up another domain as ftp.myotherdomain.com with the same things as ftp.andyibanez.com and it works fine. I can connect to it with no problems.\n\n\nOf course, I have the easy workaround that I can connect with this computer by setting a different subdomain or even using the naked domain. So I can connect to SSH. I am asking this because I am really curious as to why this happens.\n\nA: What does dig ssh.andyibanez.com return to you? DNS is not immediate action and there is some TTL. If you did the DNS change and started trying immediately, you or your DNS provider has the records cached.\nThe easiest way is to way few hours and it will start work (I can resolve these hostnames from my place and initiate ssh connection).\nOther way around is to flush your local DNS cache, probably with something like this:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n", "Q: Sophos Threat \"Adware or PUA\" on Mac I was downloading a camera user manual on the Mac and Sophos threat manager indicated Generic PUA.

My intent was to upgrade the original 8GB (from Apple) to a total of 24GB.  \nWhen I opened the back, I noticed Apple had installed a 4GB slot in the 1st & 3rd slot.  I thought that odd and would have expected it in the 1st & 2nd.  I googled around to see where I should add my additional 8GB cards, but didn't come up with anything.  So, I installed in the 2nd & 4th slot.  \nHere's the current configuration:\n\nJust to confirm, this is a poor setup?  \nI should have the 4s in the same bank together & the 8s in the same bank together?  I.e., 4GB in B0/D0, 4GB in B1/D1, 8GB in B1/D0, and 8GB in B1/D1?\n\nA: I recently bought RAM from a thirdparty vendor and faced the same issue/question. Well, initially not (for a day or so) but after I wanted to play some games in Windoes 10 on bootcamp (Battlefield1 and Dragon Age Inquisition, both using the Frostbite Engine) I faced some issues. Both games crashed to the desktop after 5-20 minutes of gameplay. This did not happen before I added the two new RAM modules and I changed nothing else.\nI had 2x8GB original RAM installed in slot 1&3 and I placed the new modules into the slots 2&4. After I noticed the crashes I searched the internet and also found the apple instructions mentioned (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191). But the guide doesn't mention anything about the correct slot usage.\nContacted the vendor and they told me that it would be best to use slot 2&4 for the larger RAM modules and 1&3 for lower modules. But of course all my modules were 8 GB - so equal size.\nSearching the internet I found some sites suggesting that memory modules of the same type should be in the same bank.\nI thought to give it a try and placed the original modules in slots 1&2 (bank 0) and the new modules in slots 3&4 (bank 1). After that change the issues with the game crashes were gone.\nI know, its not a scientific answer with hard facts but I would still suggest this layout. Cannot tell if this is a good layout for dual channel mode though.\n\nA: You can find optimal memory location instructions by going to\n Menu > About this Mac > Memory > Memory Upgrade instructions\n\nI have a different machine, but I think the link ought to take you to\nApple KB - iMac: How to remove or install memory\n…though strangely that page has no opinion on how to optimise for different RAM configurations.\nThe equivalent page for my machine has this to say…  \n\nNote: If you install different-size DIMMs in your Mac Pro, follow the order in the table. If the DIMM configuration you install doesn't provide optimized performance, the Memory Slot Utility appears onscreen and recommends an improved configuration.\n\nNormally, the optimum configuration is to have matching pairs in each bank, which would make your current setup non-optimal.\nI would test by swapping one of your 8s to a slot currently occupied by a 4 & see if the Memory Slot Utility has anything to say about it.\nIf it doesn't say anything, then either it doesn't know, or it doesn't care - but that would be the ideal, imo.\n", "Q: Boot from usb take forever Recently I made the stupid mistake of erasing MacBook Pro (2012) HDD without immediately installing OS X.

It shouldn't hurt to disconnect it though, if you want to.\n\nA: For full belt & braces backup protection, I always remove my Time Machine drive right before a major update & replace it with a new one.\nThat way, if you have major issues with the new OS - incompatible drivers with no updates yet, etc - you have a 'restore point' to return to.\nI also make a clone of the boot partition & I have a full Backblaze backup of everything too.\nYou might consider that paranoid overkill, but I haven't lost a file since the mid 90's ;-)\n", "Q: How to use the rest of my 4GB of RAM? I have a Late 2006 iMac running OS X Lion 10.7.5 with 4GB of RAM, however OS X is software limited to only addressing 3GB of the 4GB installed. I know in Windows when running a 32bit Windows OS with more than 3GB of RAM there were programs that could turn that unused RAM into a RAM disk. Is there any known way to do this in OS X? A 1GB RAM disk would be very useful as the old hard drive in this Mac only averages 40MBps.\nHere's a quote from RamDisk Plus 12 for Windows 32bit\n\nRamDisk Plus 12 has a most unique feature. Our patent pending technology can access memory beyond the limitation imposed by a Windows 32-bit operating system! In other words, RamDisk Plus 12 can use \"unmanaged\" Windows' memory e.g. above 4GB. It can also use the stubbornly inaccessible memory between 3.2GB and 4GB.\n\nOtherwise if the RAM disk isn't an option is there any other way that wasted 1GB could be put to use?\n\nA: If I were in your shoes, I would just install a 64 bit version of OS X.  That way your OS could actually use all the RAM you put in, if it really is 64 bit capable. The first 64 bit machines Apple sold, according to my knowledge, were in mid 2007.  If this machine is really 64 bit, then you should just install a 64 bit OS.  But it's more likely that it's 32 bit, so I would just let that extra 0.7GB sit there.\nIf you really want to create a RAMDISK in Mac, do this:\nCREDIT: www.tekrevue.com\nBy Jim Tanous on May 21, 2013 at 9:00 AM • @mggjimRAM Disks, as the name indicates, are logical storage volumes created using a computer’s memory (RAM) instead of a traditional hard drive or solid state drive. The benefits are easy to understand: RAM operates at speeds far beyond current hard drive technology. But there’s also a major negative: data stored in RAM is not persistent, meaning that it is erased when the RAM loses power due to a reboot, shutdown, or power loss.\nDespite this drawback, there are still several situations that can greatly benefit from the speed of a RAM Disk, including using it as a Photoshop scratch area, manipulating large video files, or testing complicated databases. If you’ve got good backups of your data and you’re willing to risk losing the contents of a RAM Disk in the event of a power failure, setting one up is easy and fun. Here’s how.\nHow Big Should a RAM Disk Be?\nThe methods for creating RAM Disks, outlined below, will allow you to create a volume of any size. You’ll want to be careful to leave enough RAM available to run your Mac, however; if you use most or all of your RAM for a RAM Disk, the system will begin paging aggressively to the hard drive and overall system performance will plummet.\nTherefore, make sure to choose a good ratio between your needs and your overall system memory. In general, it’s wise to keep your RAM Disk at or below 50 percent of your total physical memory. On a Mac with 16 GB of RAM, for example, don’t make your RAM Disk bigger than 8 GB.\nYour choice will also depend on what applications you need to run while the RAM Disk is mounted. If you’re doing heavy Photoshop work, for example, you’ll want to leave more memory available for the app. On the other hand, if you’re just muxing video and audio files you can choose a RAM Disk a bit higher than 50 percent of your total memory.\nPlay around with the tools and techniques below to determine the best choice for your Mac and your needs. Now, it’s time to create the Disk itself. In OS X, there are two primary methods of creating a RAM Disk: the Terminal or an app.\nCreating a RAM Disk via Terminal\nOpen the Terminal app from Applications > Utilities and enter the following command:\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://XXXXX`\nReplace the X characters with a number that represents the block size for the total capacity of your RAM Disk. Calculate this number by multiplying your desired size of disk in megabytes by 2048. In our example, we’ll create a 4 GB RAM Disk, which requires a number of 8388608 (4096 * 2048). Input this number in place of the X characters in the command above:\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://8388608`\n\nYou can also change the “Ram Disk” name inside the double quotes to another name you prefer. Once you’ve configured the command, press Return to launch it. After a brief moment, the system will create and mount your RAM Disk. You can now read and write to it as you would with any other drive, as long as you remember that any data stored on the disk will be lost after a reboot or power loss.\nCreating a RAM Disk with a Third Party App\nFor an even easier method, you can use a third party app to create a RAM Disk. There are several apps that perform this function, but we’ll use RAM Disk Creator from programmer Florian Bogner.\nDownload the app and launch it on your Mac. It will ask you two questions: the desired size of your RAM Disk (in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes) and the name you’d like to assign the disk. We’ll use an 8 GB disk with the unimaginative name “RAM Disk.”\n\nOnce you’ve made your choices, simply press “Create RAM Disk” and the disk will mount to your desktop.\nWith both methods, you can get rid of the RAM Disk by ejecting it or rebooting. Again, make sure that all data on the disk is backed up before doing this; the data will be irrevocably lost once you reboot or lose power.\nBenchmarks\nThe speed of RAM Disks will vary based on the performance level of your Mac’s RAM, but will still outperform traditional HDDs and SSDs by a wide margin. Here’s a performance comparison using a 16 GB RAM Disk on a 2011 27-inch 3.4GHz i7 iMac with a 240GB OWC Mercury Pro 6G SSD.\n\nThe OWC SSD can achieve 490MB/s writes and 540MB/s reads, numbers that by normal standards are exceptional. When compared to the performance of a RAM Disk, however, the SSD’s performance isn’t worth a second look. The RAM Disk peaks at about 4.2 gigabytes per second in both reads and writes, and averages about 3.5GB/s throughout the transfer sizes. For disk-intensive tasks, this performance can be a game changer.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, RAM Disks can offer power users an amazing level of performance, but it cannot be stressed enough the dangers of using volatile memory for data storage. As long as you keep good backups and save your work to a standard hard drive frequently, however, many users may find that the benefits of RAM Disks far outweigh the risks.\n\nA: Lion was [as far as I recall] uniquely bootable in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode, if your machine was capable of both.\nAs your iMac is capable of running OSes later than Snow Leopard, then I'd guess it's a late 06. Check this is in fact the model you have at Everymac - as the early 06 cannot run Lion.\nTo boot into 32 or 64 bit mode [probably best for testing] you can hold down either\n 6   4  or  3   2  at the chimes.\nTo check & switch modes…\nTo check which mode you’re currently in, run this command in Terminal:\nsystemsetup -getkernelbootarchitecturesetting\nTo set your machine to boot into 64 bit mode, enter this command and reboot:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\nTo set your machine to boot into 32 bit mode, enter this command and reboot:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\n\nA: Some chipsets from that era were limited to addressing only 3 GB, even if there were 4 GB installed. Your iMac seems to have on of these chipsets (see also this thread in the Apple support communities). \nHence, the limitation is not in the software, but in the hardware. Therefore, it seems you'll have to settle with 3GB RAM. \n", "Q: How to migrate 'local notes' or 'on my mac' notes to iCloud? I've seen so many questions asked about it, and I found a proper solution today while working. See below.

Just back up these images or copy them to iCloud documents or a USB drive before erasing. \nIf you curate your screens and put the important apps on the first page or two and have less apps, this is easier to do. (And refreshes your memory of what apps you considered important)\nAlso, with Time Machine, you can just browse the application folder or use spotlight while in Time Machine to locate any app you had installed. Lastly, the full accurate list is saved by System Information - you can save a full report to your desktop and then open that file on any other Mac (or a new install on the same Mac) to see what you had. For the command line people, system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType and also the SPInstallHistoryDataType if you care to see what was installed when.\nI love fresh installs since I get to decide which apps I really need and have an easy safety net if I cleared too much. \n", "Q: I accidentally deleted the App Store.app I accidentally deleted the App Store.app, I've tried to reinstall the OS X but it takes too long.

I fixed it by downloading the Combo update. So you can also try downloading the COMBO update for 10.9.5 from here : https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760?locale=en_US. \nCombo Updaters are your best bet since if anything changes within the app between 10.9.0 and 10.9.5, then the app will be in the package.\nHowever, since this app isn't supposed to be deletable, you might want to run a full reinstallation of the entire OS. That will perform a much better check on things and permissions in case you have further damage than just that one app being deleted.

My iPhone 5s just got stolen and I did all the proper procedures (activated lost my iPhone on icloud.com and cancelled my data with my carrier). Am I, by any chance, in risk of erasing my phone remotely and losing my last iCloud backup?\n\nA: The backups do not get erased when you send an erase request to a phone.  You are actually preserving the back ups in the sense that if your phone doesn't have a passcode lock or the passcode becomes compromised, whoever has your phone now could start deleting things and if the phone starts  A new back up then your current backup would have less of your data on it. \nThe interface for deleting back up data of an iOS device is in the manage storage portion of iCloud. If you think someone has access to your iCloud account, change your password to prevent them from deleting the data.\nSo, unless other things happen, your back up data will be sitting in iCloud waiting for you to load it on your device if you recover it or on another device of your choosing. \n", "Q: How to enable horizontal split in full screen mode in El Capitan I use my external display in tower mode. I've been using third party software ( like Moom ) to split my screen horizontally when needed. Now that El Capitan supports split screen in full screen mode, is there a way to split screen natively with two apps in horizontal split, in full screen mode.\nI searched everywhere and I am able to place two apps side by side but not top and bottom. I have also tried reducing window sizes of apps so that they fit well when in horizontal split mode. But still I never get the option of putting one on top of another. \nIs there any other settings I need to enable? I have enabled Displays have separate Spaces\n\n\nA: I use Spectacle with following keys combinations:\nalt + cmd + left key    # split window and set to left side\nalt + cmd + right key   \nalt + cmd + up          \nalt + cmd + down        \nalt + cmd + f           # full screen\n\n\nA: After looking into Spectacle as recommended in Nick's answer in this same question, as it is not maintained anymore as said in a note in the README.md of the project, they recommend Rectangle as an open-source alternative.\nIt can be installed with brew:\nbrew install --cask rectangle\n\nThen it can be used with shortcuts and also dragging windows to specific limits of the screen.\n\nA: As implemented on iOS 9 and later, OS X 10.11 lets you split the unified full-screen view into two portrait sections with one application on the left side of the partition and a different one on the right. \n\nIt's pretty basic, but it also is elegantly minimal with a clear geometry with only one degree of freedom.\nMy hope is that as more people get used to the mechanics of this, The software can be complicated to allow us to choose a horizontal petition if we desire to work that way instead of only splitting things vertically. Especially if there are compelling apps that work together in a wide but vertically narrow window.\nIf you have an excellent use case where you could be more productive at your work, please consider polite activism at http://apple.com/feedback \n\nA: Besides Spectacle mentioned by Nick, you can also split your screen with Magnet. It costs $2, but it’s available on Mac App Store.\nHowever the same restriction of Moon also applies to Magnet: you can’t use them in full-screen mode. You will see Dock popping out. I haven’t found any third-party application doing that for full-screen mode.\n\nA: BetterSnapTool has worked well for me for years\n\nA: While you can't use any command to do a horizontal split you could add a new desktop to said tower screen and just portion things once while using the other desktops for the screen for w/e else you're using. \nMy scenario was needing to see outlook calendar and mailbox on one desktop while still having a desktop with the various chat programs I use + any full screen browsers. Thee desktops later, it's all sorted - one for chats, second for outlook and third chrome in full screen.\n\nA: Not sure if this option is in El Captain but in later version you just need to hover over the plus icon on the top left of the window. If you hold options you can move the window instead of snapping it to the sides.\n\n", "Q: Handoff with 2011 Mac using El Capitan I've enabled handoff on Macs (mine is 2011 era) that don't officially support it, but with El Capitan changes, Apple has really tried to put the handcuffs on more tightly so users can't muck with any system files\nSpecifically, El Capitan enabled System Integrity Protection, which is causing a lot of grief by it's defense in depth addition to restricting many system filesystem locations.

I use the cmdbackspace shortcut but in some applications fnbackspace seems to work as well. So which one it the delete hotkey in OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: A detailed description on this is available on this post https://superuser.com/questions/482771/difference-between-cmdbackspace-and-fnbackspace-keyboard-shortcuts-in-osx\nTo summarize:\n\n*\n\n*The most commonly used key for deleting elements that can be selected in the user interface is Backward Delete ⌫ since it's available without a modifier on all Apple keyboards. This applies to songs on a playlist, graphics in an image editor, deleting text boxes in Pages, etc.\n\n\n*The Forward Delete fn⌫ is mostly used for the same actions, so you can actually use both in an interchangable way for most applications, be it Numbers, Excel, iTunes, Photoshop, etc.\n\n\n*The combination ⌘⌫ is intended for actions that might have an immediate (unwanted) effect. One could indeed map trashing files and folders to a simple ⌫, but this could lead to accidental deletions. Finder uses the modifier as a safeguard. This also explains why iTunes will only delete a song without confirmation if you press the ⌘ modifier.\n\nA: In a text editor…\n Fn   Backspace ←  is the equivalent of  Delete ⌦ for short keyboards without that key\n\n\n*\n\n* Backspace ←  deletes the character before the cursor.  \n\n* Delete ⌦ deletes the character after the cursor.  \n\n* Cmd ⌘   Backspace ←  deletes the entire line before the cursor.\n\n* Opt ⌥   Backspace ←  deletes the word before the cursor.\n\n* Opt ⌥   Delete ⌦ deletes the word after the cursor.\n\n\nIn the Finder…\n\n\n*\n\n* Cmd ⌘   Backspace ←  deletes the selected file(s).\n\n* Cmd ⌘   Delete ⌦ has no function.\n\n", "Q: iOS messages to iMessage (Mac) I have recently moved from an android phone to an iPhone 5.

I have attempted to save SMS.db from the iPhone backup and rename it chat.db.  However, it does not recreate the messages so I think there is more to the story than a simple renaming.\nThanks!\n\nA: This is possible. \nMove the sms.db and Attachments from your phone. They are located at /var/mobile/Library/SMS/ or you can extract them from a backup made by iTunes.\nOn your Mac, move the contents of ~/Library/Messages to a backup location. \nCopy the sms.db and Attachments folder to ~/Library/Messages\nUsing an SQLite browser such as DB Browser open the sms.db file and execute the following to change location of attachments:\nUPDATE attachment\nSET filename = replace(filename, '/Library/SMS/Attachments/', '/Library/Messages/Attachments/')\nWHERE filename LIKE '%/Library/SMS/Attachments/%';\nRename sms.db to chat.db\nThen you should delete the folder ~/Library/containers/com.apple.iChat and restart.

I have a nice set of Apple earpods, but I have a problem with them falling out of my ears. All earbuds have some tendency to fall out, but the Apple ones, while comfortable and nice sounding, are particularly slippery. I can't use the in-ear variety because they give me painful ear infections.\nSome earbuds I've used have a stickier rubber layer around the circumference that help them not to fall out. Especially in very cold winter conditions when my ear skin is less supple and sticky the rubber holds on well enough to keep the buds in my ear.\nI wonder if there is any kind of mild adhesive I can wrap around or apply to the earpod to make it stickier. I'd really like to have a nice reliable way to use these otherwise wonderful Apple ones through the cold months.\n\nA: One solution, wear them under a pair of earmuffs. (Wikipedia article)  The pods would need no modification and your ears would stay toasty warm.\nThere are several brands out there that fit snugly on the ears so they would hold the earbuds in place.  It may even improve sound quality.\n\nA: I have a friend who often works nights and so needs earplugs to ensure she gets enough sleep. To get un disturbed sleep she uses lumps of what I'd describe as soft wax. Hers were hospital issued but they are available via chemists. I have used this wax to embed my earpiece into and it works! I'd say give it a try as it's cheap and easy to use.\n\nA: I found these things a couple of years ago Earskinz which are essentially little rubber covers for Apple ear pods.

Is there a way to play a song without accidentally deselecting the other highlighted ones?\n\nAlso, is there any way to stop iTunes automatically jumping to whatever track just started playing?\n\nA: One thing you can do is right clicking and click \"Play next\", going to the up next bar on the top, and clicking on the song you want to play and clearing the other selected song.\nAs to stopping iTunes from jumping to whatever track you just pressed, right click and choose \"Play next\" or \"Add to Up Next\" to put it in queue. \n\nA: You basically just want a way to keep songs in a list that you can go through and choose which ones you want to delete. There are two options that are much better than highlighting (iTunes 12.5.4):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add songs to Up Next (three bulleted lines next to name of track now playing), which is basically a playlist that will play automatically, by right clicking on a song and clicking \"Play Next\" to play next or \"Play Later\" to put it at the bottom of the list.

Before El Capitan it said 1 2 3.\nWhen this script is double clicked, it needs to say 1 2 3.\non run\n  say \"1\"\n  testing()\nend run\n\non testing()\n  say \"2\"\nend testing\n\non idle\n  say \"3\"\n  return 60\nend idle\n\non quit\nend quit\n\n\nA: The on idle and quit handler are for Applets, not Scripts. Applets and scripts are different, however they are both written in Applescript.\nAn applet, is script application, which support idle and quit handlers, while script is like any other script in any language; it runs and till the end, doesn't know when it's about to exit, or when it's idle. Applet it like any other application, if you right click and \"Open Package Content\" of an applet you'll see the resemblance. Applet can have resources, can be CodeSigned, can have multiple script and shared without any problem.\nThat's your problem, choose to save the script as an application when asked, also select \"Stay open after run handler\", then your idle handler will run.\nFew more things, it's always a good idea to return out of every handler, which you aren't in run and testing, this can cause the idle handler to not run as it'll be waiting for run to finish. You should also insert continue quit in your quit handler, otherwise it'll never quit; you'll have to force quit it.\nFor more info AppleScript Language Guide\n\nA: First: I cannot reproduce your problem on OS X El Capitan 10.11 (15A284). Your script says “1”, “2”, “3” every time I run it.\nThe exact order of the “run” and “idle” messages may have never been guaranteed, so it may be possible that both orders ({1, 2, 3} and {3, 1, 2}) are considered correct.\nHowever, if the order of the run and idle messages is important to your script, you could use a script property to let the idle handler know when the run handler has already executed and do nothing until it has, e.g.,\nproperty didRun : false\n\non run\n    say \"1\"\n    testing()\n    set didRun to true\nend run\n\non testing()\n    say \"2\"\nend testing\n\non idle\n    if not didRun then\n        say \"has not run\"\n        return 1\n    end if\n\n    say \"3\"\n    return 3\nend idle\n\non quit\n    set didRun to false\n\n    say \"quit\"\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\nNote that resetting didRun in the quit handler is necessary because property values normally persist across runs (by being written back to the script file after execution).\n", "Q: How to properly install Kali Linux on MacBook Air (dual-boot with El Capitan) I updated to El Capitan yesterday (on MacBook Air 2014).

But that's probably a second question.\nHere is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I made a fresh install of El Capitan 10.11.1 after repartitioning the internal drive to 1 partition with a GUID partition table.\n\n*After configuring El Capitan I downloaded Kali Linux and rEFInd 0.9.2\n\n*Then  I dd'ed the kali iso image to a thumb drive:\nFirst get the disk identifier of the thumb drive and unmount it:\ndiskutil list\n\nMy thumb drive had the disk identifier disk2.\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\n\nthen dd the iso to the thumb drive:\nsudo dd if=/Users/your_user_name/Downloads/kali-linux-2.0-amd64.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m\n\nThe thumb drive will be bootable without installing rEFInd.\n\n*Then I booted to Recovery HD by holding cmdR while booting. Disable System Integrity Protection in Terminal with\ncsrutil disable\n\n\n*Reboot to Internet Recovery Mode by holding altcmdR.You will see a spinning globe animation while booting.\n\n*Since you probably have a CoreStorage partition after installing El Capitan you have to resize it. I doubt that the disk partition tool in the Kali Live USB drive succeeds with that. Open Terminal and enter:\ndiskutil cs list\ndiskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID size\n\nlvUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume. It's the last one listed in the output of diskutil cs list. The size has to be in t, g, m or k. Example: If your main disk has 250 GB and you need 40 GB free space to install Kali Linux to, enter 210g.\n\nIf you don't have a CoreStorage stack on your Mac you may choose Disk Utility to resize the main volume. The Recovery HD should be moved automatically in both cases.\n\n*Reboot while holding the alt key. Boot to the Windows partition of the thumb drive. Choose Graphical Install and configure the locale settings. The network interface install will probably fail. Choose none. Use the defaults of the disk partitioning tool. It will choose the empty space on your main disk to create a small boot partition for grub, a main partition and a swap partition. Then Kali Linux will be installed. Install grub to the mbr of your main disk.\n\n*After a reboot the Mac will boot to OS X. Eject the Kali Linux installer thumb drive.\n\n*Install rEFInd:\ncd /Users/your_user_name/Downloads/refind-bin-0.9.2\n./install.sh\n\nRename the refind folder and the efi file:\ncd /Volumes/ESP/EFI\nmv refind boot\nmv boot/refind_x64.efi boot/bootx64.efi\n\nImmediately after installing rEFInd the EFI volume is mounted at /Volumes/ESP and the install script fails to unmount it. If you mount disk0s1 later manually (e.g. after a reboot) with diskutil mount /dev/disk0s1 it will be mounted to /Volumes/EFI! Then you have to use cd /Volumes/EFI/EFI instead.\n\n*Quit Terminal and reboot while holding alt\n\n*Choose EFI Boot at the Mac boot screen and then Kali Linux at rEFInd boot screen.\n\n*Set up Kali Linux\n\n\n\nEverything except the WLAN interface (and AFAIK the webcam) works now.\nTo further set up Kali Linux check the following resources:\nHOWTO : Kali Linux 1.0.6 on MacBook Air (Mid 2013) 13 inches\nTo get the Broadcom chip to work check:\nHow to install Broadcom BCM4360 on debian on Macbook pro\nHow do I install build-essential without an Internet connection?\nKali 2.0 Installation Tips for Macbook Pro 2015 Retina\nBroadcom firmware\nInstalling Debian On Apple MacBook Air6-2\nb43 and b43legacy\nUntil now I haven't been able to get WLAN working but I'm investigating that and I will extend the answer as soon as I'm successful.\n\nAfter setting up everything successfully boot to the Recovery HD again and reenable System Integrity Protection in Terminal with\ncsrutil enable\n\n\nA: You have to get the order right first.\n1) Download rEFInd and UNetbootin\n2) Reboot while holding the Option key upon boot\n3) Go into Recovery HD and create a partition for Kali\n4) Open Terminal and type: csrutil disable\n5) Reboot then use UNetbootin to 'burn' the ISO onto your USB\n6) Reboot with USB plugged in and holding the Option key upon boot\n7) At the rEFInd screen you will have the choice to boot from the USB\n8) Boot from the USB and install Kali as normal\nAs for your issue with WiFi, here's a simple fix. Here is a page from a wiki for Arch but it is the same for Kali as well. Since Kali is Debian-based, use the broadcom-wl and not the broadcom-wl-dkms as the driver.\nThen there's the webcam thing. There's a driver hidden in the OS X partition at:\n\n/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBVideoSupport.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleUSBVideoSupport\n\nThese one, two and three sites all give detailed instructions about how to extract and load the driver for the iSight camera. If you're looking through the firmware and still can't find the right one, check this or this site.\n\nA: RainMan here, forgot my acc, anyway, managed to install Kali - moving forward - however, because before that I managed to mess up several times, including wiping out my entire OS, second time I installed Kali I forgot to get Refind before it.\nSo I installed Kali, and looked it over, then decided i want to go back to Mac HD, so i restarted my laptop, got into Mac HD, and now I don't know how to get back into Kali, can't see it. I'm sure it's on my hardware somewhere, but no idea how to access it, any ideas?\nThank you\n\nA: http://www.zealpeal.com/dual-boot-os-x-el-capitan-on-macbook-pro-with-kali-linux/ Check out this for full guide on installing Kali linux on macbook pro with El Capitan along with instrustions on how to install rEFInd.\n\nA: Kali linux image is available for easy install within this new mac virtualization tool called Veertu.

I want to stream them to a SmartTV;  something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*On my iPhone\n\n*Open network share\n\n*Find folder with pics\n\n*Stream to DLNA/SmartTV\n\n\nThe only app I've found so far is iMediaShare. However, it is an old app - and have an issue with the slideshow: you need to manually list all files in the folder,  then start the slideshow (otherwise it will stream only first batch of files).\nAll other streaming apps do support streaming of my local iPhone Camera Roll, which is fine, but I don't need it.\nWhy do I need it?\nThe software in my TV and media player works slow, and are less responsive. It takes time to navigate to next photo.  It takes time to load stuff. I need to sit in the front of TV and see what is going on. I need to handle different remote controls/apps. Moreover, some of my shares are private, and I don't want TV to access them; but still want to stream some images from it. So, at the end: it is much more convenient for me to use it like described above.\n\nA: Try Filpps Tv you can get from apple store\n", "Q: Thunderbolt 3 compatible with Apple Thunderbolt Display Is it possible to connect a Thunderbolt 3 equipped Mac (I know there isn't one at present) with the 2011 Apple Thunderbolt Display?\nI'm just curious.

So I was wondering if it's possible to prevent steam from starting in the same way there are apps that block you from accessing the internet. \n\nA: How do you launch Steam?  I think you could create some kind of scheduled task in Automator/cron that either moves Steam.app to another location (preventing your Dock icon from working) or, if you use Spotlight, somehow breaking the application bundle.\nFor example, you could disable with:\nmkdir ~/NoSteam/\nmv /Applications/Steam.app/Contents ~/NoSteam/\n\nAnd re-enable with:\nmv ~/NoSteam/Contents/ /Applications/Steam.app\n\nKludgy but effective.\n", "Q: How to remove connected passwords on Wi-Fi on Mac I want to remove the connected Wi-Fi password on my Mac so that it always ask me for my Wi-Fi password, but I am unable to do so. How can I do this?\nI tried this by going towards System Preferences -> Network. I was unable to remove anything, however. See the following image of the settings.\n\n\nA: EDIT 2 Sorry, misread the question.\nYour System Preference pane is probably locked. The screenshot you posted is from the \"Advanced\" section. \nGo back to basic network preferences, and look at the bottom left corner of the window. There should be a lock saying \"Click the lock to make changes\".\nClick the lock and enter an administrator username and password.\nGo back to the \"Advanced\" settings and the controls will no longer be locked.\nEDIT 2: Un-check \"remember networks this computer has joined\" to prevent your Mac from remembering the networks.\nIn Network preferences, remove the network whose password you want to enter each time.\nIn Keychain Access, search for the name of the network whose password you want your Mac to \"forget\". Then right click on it and click the item that says Delete \"item name\" where item name is the name of the password item.\nEDIT 1\nIf you want to prevent panes from locking, go to \"Security and Privacy\" preferences, unlock the pane (this one will always be locked) and click \"Advanced...\" in the bottom right.

I would like to always keep the flag, also after reading the message.\n\nA: I reported this as a bug in 2006. It appears that Apple either doesn't use Mail or doesn't care about this feature.\nYou can get add-on software, such as Mailhub, to repair this feature.\n", "Q: How do I share Keynote presentations and perform collaborative editing on iCloud? Apple states that iCloud is the perfect platform for building presentations with the web-based keynote and for sharing and collaborating on documents.\nI cannot figure out how to share a Keynote presentation so that two people can edit the document without having to email it back and forth. Is there a way to do this? I would also like to edit the document at the same time with someone else, as I can with Google.\n\nA: I save the document on my Mac or my iPad and then quit keynote.\nThen I open https://www.icloud.com/#keynote in Safari 9 on a computer (most other newishly updated browsers work too)\nIf you don't see the \"coaching tips\" - click the white ? in the white circle in the top right next to your name.\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click your keynote you want to share.

I want to know how I can send a SMS message (not an iMessage) from my Mac. I don't have great Wi-Fi right now, so I need to send a text message in order for it to go through. I know to send one on an iPhone, one needs to hold down the message bubble, but I don't know how to send one on OS X.\n\nA: This is called Text Message Forwarding and requires iOS 8.1 or above. Make sure both the OS X Messages App and your iPhone have the same Apple ID enabled. Then, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, tap Settings > Messages.\n\n*Tap Text Message Forwarding.\n\n*Enable your Mac in the list of devices.\n\n*On your Mac, open Messages.\n\n*A six-digit activation code appears.\n\n*Enter this code on your iPhone, then tap Allow.\n\n\nThat should just about do it.\n\nA: Forgive me as I am not sure where in the world you are, but at least here in the US you can typically send text messages in one of two ways (other than by phone):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the recipient's carrier's email-to-SMS gateway (typically something like NNNNNNNNNN@txt.carrier.com).\n\n*Using the recipient's carrier's send-a-text website. \n\n\nThis assumes, of course, that you know which carrier your recipient is using.

Here's a syslog snippet on gist.github.com. Clues so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Started after upgrading to Yosemite / El Capitan (I only ran Yosemite for a week or so before upgrading to El Capitan)\n\n*Only happens in cafes or on campus, i.e., where there are other devices around.\n\n*Usually only ever disconnects as soon as I use the mouse after not using it for a few minutes. I.e., usually the mouse sits for several minutes and doesn't have any issues when I start to use it again; sometimes it has this disconnect aneurysm while actively using it.\n\n\nThings I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the mouse, restarting, and pairing with it again via the Bluetooth PreferencePane.\n\n*Ensuring the batteries are fresh / completely charged.\n\n\nBased on #3 and what I gather from the logs, I'm guessing it's going into some sort of sleep / standby mode, and not always waking properly. Perhaps there's some OS X system setting that will let me turn this off or increase the period of time that counts as sleep-worthy inactivity?\n\nA: In System Preferences for Bluetooth you can check the box to \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar.\" Then, hold down the option key and click the Bluetooth icon when paired with your device. You'll see a new option to \"Create Diagnostics Report on the Desktop.\" This will give you more details to further debug or diagnose what's going on, particularly the files pmset_everything.txt, and com.apple.Bluetooth.plist in the section on BluetoothStats.

So I'm about ready to upgrade my mac (which is on the other side of the United States) to El Capitan. I'll only have access to the computer via Chrome Remote Desktop and SSH while this happens.\nHas anyone tried this before, and is there anything I should be worried about happening or any need to have physical access to the computer?\nI will have some physical access, but it will be either a couple of days away or will be very unskilled labor.\nThe reason I'm doing this at all is that I actually do a significant amount of work on this computer remotely, but I'm away from it long-term (I do development on it over SSH from my chromebook).\n\nA: I personally would recommend staying away from anything that requires a restart of a remote computer you don't have easy access to. First I would hope that you have a backup of your computer since it sounds like it's important (aka more than just a web browser to you) whether or not you decide to proceed with this update. However why I recommend against you doing any restarts let alone an update is you are unable to control your computer from the moment you log off to the moment you log back on. If the update were to fail for some reason and the computer is unable to boot/log in you will be out of contact with it till someone can see what the issue is and fix anywhere from needing to type in a password to worst being go through a Time Machine restore of before the update. So basically to keep it simple if the worst case scenario of being unable to use your computer till someone can tend to it is not that bad of a thing to you, go ahead, a remote desktop connection does not put the computer at higher risk of something bad happening. If that is a bad thing then try to hold off till you have some safe down time.

I've been made aware that my iMessages have been going to an iPad that I lent to someone a while back. I do not want this particular person to have access to my messages for several reasons. They are refusing to return it to me so that I can fix this issue. \nI tried to locate the iPad on 'Find my iPhone' so that I could remotely wipe it but it is not on my list of devices. I am fairly sure I had signed out of the Apple ID before lending it out. I have changed my AppleID password in the case that the iPad is still signed on. But beyond that, I am not sure why the iPad was receiving my messages or how else I can stop it. Is it possible the messages were going to my device without the AppleID? How can I stop the messages without having the device in my possession? Appreciate any feedback, thank you.\n\nA: There are multiple places in which your AppleID can be used on a given device: iMessages, FaceTime, iCloud, App Store, etc. It sounds like what is going on is that the iPad is still logged into your AppleID for iMessages, but perhaps not for other items.\nPerhaps the easiest way to handle this is to change your AppleID password. You can do this on Apple's site: https://appleid.apple.com. After that is done, you will then need to go through each of your devices and update the password that is used for the App Store and Messages/FaceTime.\n", "Q: Exact string matches considering Case with COUNTIF =COUNTIF(B1:B7; \"US\") counts anything with US us Us uS anywhere in the cell B1:B7\nHow to count ONLY exact matches to \"US\" accounting for case? (only that string, only capitalized)\n\nA: It would be great if this could be accomplished with a single formula, but as of this writing Numbers does not support Array formulas.  \nI was able to solve it by testing for \"US\" and returning \"1\" for true and \"0\" for false.\n\n\n*\n\n*Formula in adjacent or other column: =IFERROR(FIND(\"US\",A1),0) and drag formula down.

Since upgrading to El Capitan including update 10.11.1 the built-in keyboard and multitouch trackpad freeze intermittently for about 4 seconds randomly at least once every 60 seconds. Booting from an external drive with Yosemite or Mountain Lion doesn't exhibit this issue so the hardware is fine. Using a bluetooth Magic Trackpad in El Capitan also works fine. I've reset PRAM and SMC. If I don't type or touch the built-in trackpad, interacting using only the Magic Trackpad then there are no stalls and no Console error messages but when using the built-ins at random intervals at least once every 60 seconds the keyboard pauses and loses all keystrokes entered during the interval, and the pointer freezes then eventually snaps to a new location. So, the system is unusable with El Capitan. \n\n\n*\n\n*Have reinstalled El Capitan 10.11.1 twice after reformatting the internal HD.

Apple OS X clears the caches on its own so there is no gain if you do it also.\nChrome needs caches as does Safari, there is not much difference. Safari has better security.\nYour problem can only be solved by freeing up more space definitively (moving a music or movies library for example to a second disk).\n", "Q: How to \"Secure Empty Trash...\" (wipe free space) on OS X El Capitan? Before OS X El Capitan, when viewing the Trash folder and pressing the \"Alt\" key you have been able to Secure Empty Trash... however this feature has been removed from OS X El Capitan!\nDoes anyone know how to reactivate this option via Terminal? Is this possible?\n\nA: The reason for removing this option has been explained here by Apple: \n\nAn issue existed in guaranteeing secure deletion of Trash files on some systems, such as those with flash storage. This issue was addressed by removing the \"Secure Empty Trash\" option.\n\nSo while it might seem annoying that this option is gone, bringing it back via some kind of Terminal wizardry is not going to make it safe/reliable.\nIf you have sensitive material, I'd suggest not storing it unencrypted in the first place, so that deleting it in the \"normal\" way becomes a non-issue.\n\nA: The secure delete option was removed from El Capitan, but as explained in this article, there may be some alternatives you may wish to use (see below for notes if the Mac has an SSD).\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the disk utility to overwrite the free space on the drive;\ndiskutil secureErase freespace LEVEL /Volumes/DRIVENAME\n\nWhere;\n\nIn this command, change LEVEL to a number of 0 through 4, where 0 is a single-pass of zeros, 1 is a single-pass of random numbers, 2 is a 7-pass erase, 3 is a 35-pass erase, and 4 is a 3-pass erase (note all non single-pass options may take a while to complete).\n\nYou can consult the man page for more detail on the command usage.\n\n*Overwrite the contents before the deletion (from the terminal);\nrm -rP /path/to/file-or-folder\n\nWhere r is to recurse over the folders and P will overwrite their contents.\n\n*The srm utility provides a mechanism (from at least Yosemite) to overwrite and remove files, lifehacker has an article on its use;\nsrm -v ~/Path/To/file.remove\n\nThe -v indicates verbose mode. \n\n*Consider using the \"Delete Immediately\" option that was added to El Capitan. Whilst this may not be the \"secure delete\" you are looking for, it does skip the trash.\nIt is important to bear in mind that with modern SSD wear levelling, writing to the same location in a file isn't necessarily going to write to the same location on the disk, hence the secure deletion would not always achieve what you wanted (see CVE-2015-5901 and hence removed in El Capitan). Given an SSD, the \"erase\"-ing of the free space is probably the best option, once the files have been deleted and removed from the trash.\nFor those with mechanical disks (non-SSD), the srm option may be the easiest alternative.\n\nA: I use Permanent Eraser.app (http://www.edenwaith.com/products/permanent%20eraser/)\n", "Q: Using the space bar as a shortcut in finder to preview audio files I recently was given an old MacBook (Late 2007) running 10.4 from a family member. I'm using it basically as a backup for my studio computer. It's going to contain only the apps included in 10.7 and 1 additional NI audio product. My question is, my other mac and all I've ever worked on (and it's a few) have been able to use the space bar to preview a highlighted audio file in Finder. Is there a way to cut this off/on? I really like this feature and it saves me probably 30-60 minutes a day because I go through thousands of audio files a day.\n\nA: Looks like Quick View is only available for Mac OS X 10.5 and later.\nBottom line, download 10.5 and the spacebar Quick Look will work.\nAs a side note, if you're looking for other shortcuts that might be missing from OS 10.4, there's a shortcut creator (on steroids) that's free, and it's called BetterTouchTool.

The battery indicater is showing the X & the system profiler is stating no battery available. My question is after doing a SMC reset with no change is this definetly a battery connector or motherboard issue or is there any chance a new battery may be a fix?\n\nA: In Applications->Utilities there is an app called SystemInformation. Start it, on the left side select \"Power\", on the right side find (battery..) \"health information\" cycle count should not be more than 500 and condition should be \"normal\". Anything other than \"normal\" means: replace the battery. Do that asap as the battery may be leaking or swelling.

I hope this can help you out, but for now I have no clue on your system setup.\n\nA: I've got an answer to this problem for people coming here with this issue who aren't using Active Directory (meaning that it can't be the cause).\nFor me the problem was my Dropbox was struggling with broken symlinks inside my Dropbox folder. I had about 20-25 of these broken symlinks. You can see if this is the problem for you by whether the problem goes away when you quit Dropbox (and wait a bit for the Activity Monitor to calm down).\nYou can see the location of these broken symlinks with:\ncd ~/Dropbox\nfind . -type l ! -exec test -e {} \\; -print\n\nIf you want to then delete these (they're broken after all, just get rid of them), you can run this:\nfind . -type l ! -exec test -e {} \\; -print | xargs rm\n\nI quit my Dropbox program before doing this. After turning it back on, the problem was gone!\nNote: I ran this with gfind instead of find, which is the GNU version of find that you can get by doing brew install findutils. It should work perfectly fine with regular find though.\n", "Q: Apple watch app without functionality I have a client who wants to add Apple Watch functionality to its app. However, my client wants to take paid from its customers using In App Purchase to activate this content. This will lead to an \"empty\" app on the apple watch with informative text to the user to purchase the Apple Watch IAP package to enable its functionality. \nAlthough the request from my client is logical, I have a hard time believing Apple will approve such an app. Also, with regards to 2.12 of the review guidelines:\n\nApps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as\n  Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be\n  rejected\n\nI can imagine Apple will interpret my client's Watch app as an app that is not very useful, until the user purchase the functionality.\nAnybody with any experience here or having more insight on whether it would be worth giving it a try or not? Last thing we'd like to do is waste our time ;)\n\nA: I would say you are over thinking the watch app.\nWatch apps on Watch OS 2 and iOS 9 are extensions. They are the antithesis of a functioning app and simply a little detail or a little tidbit.\nFurthermore, Apple approves apps that do absolutely nothing without a paid account. Netflix, Casper Focus, Splunk, all the newsstand subscriptions where you need to pay for content before reading an issue.\nNow - Apple's review guidelines let them have great latitude to deny apps for no reason at all - let alone 2.12 \"not very useful\" which itself is highly subjective.\nWhat you are concerned about also concerns many other app developers and it sure would be nice if there were a way to pay for \"Pre-Approval of Innovative Features\" so you could invest maybe 5k of effort to prototype and then pay for a review by Apple before investing the actual amount of development work in your app. See this story for the details of how pre-approval and the developers surveyed are in similar situation wondering what might pass review:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macstories.net/stories/developers-apples-app-review-needs-big-improvements/\n", "Q: According to System Information I have one processor and 2 cores, but when I open the 'CPU-usage' window in Activity Monitor I see 4 graphs What does this 4 graphs mean and how are they related to my 2 cores?\nI have a MacBook Pro (13 inch medio 2012?\n\n\n\nA: You have a multi-threaded CPU. Your computer has one processor, with two physical cores, and two virtual threads on each core. So to the computer it sees four cores/threads available. This makes it easier for load balancing and sharing of the CPU between processes. See this Wikipedia article.\n", "Q: Is RAID1 volume usable while rebuilding RAID after disk failure? One disk of my 2-disk-RAID1-stack has failed and I'm about to replace it.\nIs the volume usable—i.e. can I read & write just as I normally could—while Disk Utility is rebuilding the RAID?\n\nA: Yes, rebuilding happens in the background and the volume can be accessed normally. \nI/O performance might be affected, but in my own experience it's more likely the rebuilding process that takes the performance-hit—i.e. rebuilding would be faster if the volume wasn't in use.\n", "Q: Why does pidof from homebrew returns always zero? I've installed pidof via homebrew\nbrew install pidof\n\nAnd think about two cases:\n$ pidof bash > /dev/null; echo $?\n$ pidof asdf > /dev/null; echo $?\n\nThe results are:\n0\n0\n\nWhy does it happen? Other linux throw 1 when pidof couldn't find process.\n\nA: If you look at the Homebrew formula of pidof, you will see that the Homebrew version is built from : http://www.nightproductions.net/downloads/pidof_source.tar.gz\nIf you look at the source code pidof.c used by Homebrew, you will see that each occurrence of the return statement in the main function, is in the form:\nreturn 0\n\nexcept one time, when the usage of the command is printed:\nprintf(\"USAGE: %s [-klvh] [PID name]\\n\",ProgName);\n                return 1;\n                break;\n\nOn the other hand, in Linux distributions, such as Debian, the pidof command is coming  from the System V style init programs. If you download the source code and look at killall5.c (which is then linked to pidof), you have at the last line of the main function:\nreturn retval;\n\nwhere retvalcan be non-null.\nSo the main reson why the Homebrew version of pidof and the Linux version of pidof return different values is because they use different codebase.\n\nA: The reason is that the pidof from HomeBrew is a different program than pidof in Linux. Even though they share the same name, and parts of the same functionality, they're actually quite different. \nFor example the HomeBrew pidof will also kill processes for you when specifying the -k argument, which Linux pidof cannot do. In contrast Linux pidof lets you specify you only want a single PID returned in single-shot mode with the -s parameter, the HomeBrew version hasn't got such an option. There are many other differences.\nOn Linux, pidof comes from the ubiquitous sysvinit-tools package. When you do a pidof programname in Linux, it loops through the running processes while keeping track of whether or not it found the program name you're looking for. If it doesn't find it, it returns an exit status of !0 (which is 1).\nIn HomeBrew, pidof is a standalone utility from \"Night Productions\". Their program has no source in common with the Linux pidof, and does not track whether or not it found the program name. It always returns an exit status of 0 in any case.\n", "Q: How to propagate Wi-Fi packets to other interfaces on a router I have two computers connected to an ethernet/wifi dlink router:\nLaptop: Connected via Wi-Fi\nDesktop: Connected via ethernet\nMy understanding is that the desktop computer will never see any packets exchanged via Wi-Fi between the laptop and the router which means, I suppose, that the desktop computer cannot sniff any FTP passwords that I use to connect using the laptop (without SSL)\nIs it possible to set up the router to send copies of Wi-Fi packets to the ethernet interface?\n\nA: It highly depends on the (SOHO-) router and its internals if sniffing is possible. Usually Wi-Fi and ethernet ports are separated and you can't sniff Wi-Fi with an external ethernet device. Even if your router contains several ethernet interfaces and all of them are attached to an internal switch, packet capturing of the other ethernet ports is impossible.\nSome routers contain an internal sniffer though. My router (AVM Fritz!Box 7490) provides a sniffing feature for diagnosis:\n\nAfter choosing one or several of the different interfaces and hitting one or several start buttons I get a full capture in Wireshark format.\nYour D'link router may contain a similar feature. Or a free firmware with this feature exists for your router.\n\nA second option is a Wi-Fi sniffer attached to the desktop computer.\n", "Q: Why doesn't OS X require graphics card driver updates? I don't know how to update Nvidia graphic card drivers on MacBook Pro Retina.\nI have been a Windows user and a gamer for a long time where we expect frequent driver updates. \nMy expectations revolve around whether Nvidia releases graphic driver updates for Mac and how to check for pending updates.\nWhere can I see the versions of drivers on OS X?\n\nA: To hazard an educated guess, I would say that driver updates are most likely rolled into Mac OS X version upgrades and point updates. If you're concerned about the updates available for your particular card, (especially if it is not original to the Mac you're using,) it behooves you to visit the manufacturer's respective web sites to check. You mentioned NVIDIA: here's the link to the drivers available for download. Looks like plenty of options for many operating systems. (Mac OS X NVIDIA drivers are only available for Quadro-series boards, tho'.)\n\nA: Besides the drivers that Apple bundles with OS X updates, Nvidia also provides their own driver updates for their GeForce cards — yes, even the \"mobile\" cards that Apple puts in Macs. As far as I know, this is not true of AMD and Intel. In the case of your Retina MacBook Pro with an Nvidia card, there's beta support with Nvidia's latest drivers.\nNvidia's graphics drivers for OS X can be downloaded straight from their website, and as such they're sometimes called Nvidia Web Drivers. They're somewhat hard to find if you just go through Nvidia's driver search feature, but they're an easy find if you just Google \"Nvidia driver OS X\" + your OS X version (e.g. 10.11.2).\nFor example, here is Nvidia's current (as of December 2015) driver for OS X El Capitan 10.11.2. As it says in the release notes, support for some newer models of iMacs and MacBook Pros with GeForce cards is in beta. \nNote that I don't recommend installing Nvidia's drivers (especially beta ones) unless you know what you're doing, and you have a good reason to switch from the default (Apple-provided) ones that come with OS X. The default drivers are probably more thoroughly tested and stable, less likely to break your Mac, and are supported officially by Apple. If you do install the Nvidia driver, though, you'll always have the option to switch back to the default driver or even uninstall the Nvidia driver via System Preferences. You'll also be able to update the driver from there.\nA good reason to try out Nvidia's driver might be if you use your Mac for gaming, or you run any other apps that use OpenGL. On my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.11.2 and an Nvidia GT 650m card, Cinebench's OpenGL test gives a very slight edge to Nvidia's drivers (~52 fps) vs. Apple's (~49 fps).\n\nA: Apple makes its own drivers & they are included in the OS updates.\nThe way to be up to date on drivers is to always be running the latest OS.\nThere is debate over whether Apple make the entire driver set themselves, or just take NVidia/AMD's core code & add their own hardware/OS-specific code to it. The latter seems more plausible to me, but either is just speculation.\nThe end result, though, is that there are rarely issues with Apple graphics drivers & regular software or games; again speculation, but for games I imagine they write to a pre-defined rule-set, rather than try to constantly be pushing the boundaries.\nAs noted elsewhere, NVidia themselves make OS X drivers for Quadro cards but these are aftermarket cards anyway, not supplied in any Mac build option available directly from Apple.\nApple provides core drivers, currently up to OpenGL 4.1 or 3.3 - depending on your card, of course - plus legacy drivers for OGL 2.1 compatibility. Which one you get to use in any particular game etc is up to the writers of that game.  \nTraditionally, if your card has full OpenGL support for the first monitor, it will also have it on the second, unlike many PC cards with 'clipped' performance on the 2nd monitor. \nLink to OpenGL support by Mac model\nAfter comments & other answers here…\nNVidia do have their own release for certain Mac GPUs - this is the current driver as of December 2015\nHowever, they are predominantly for the Quadro series of aftermarket cards rather than default cards supplied by Apple.\nThere is also support for some cards which have been legacied by Apple - namely the GeForce 680, 285, 120 & 8800\nThere is mention of beta support for some recent mobile cards, presumably as Apple are dropping legacy support on these in favour of AMD in the current lineup.\n\nA: I'll set aside the why and answer some of the what:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Information and go to the software section. Click on Extensions and you can see all the hardware drivers as well as whether it is updated via Apple or via a third party.\n\n*Apple updates all come from the softwareupdate command line tool. You can reset any ignored updates and then call for all updates to be listed with this compound command: softwareupdate --reset-ignored ; softwareupdate --list --all\n\nA: It looks like Apple doesn't really bother to update the graphics driver... On a Mid 2014 MacBook Pro, running High Sierra, System Report tells me that the driver was last changed in October (so less than a month ago from when I'm writing this, roughly coinciding with the release of 10.13.1). However, the info text says the driver is based on Geforce 355.11, released in 2015.\nI only realized all this because I had massive performance issues after the upgrade to High Sierra (with its brand new graphics subsystem, Metal2), so basically I wondered the same thing, \"Do I need to update the drivers?\". With the drivers from Nvidia it's now a lot smoother.\nSo to answer your questions (2 years later, but well):\n\n\n*\n\n*You find the version of the graphics driver under: Apple Menu > About this Mac > System Report > Software > Extensions > Geforce. But don't trust the date, check against the Geforce version.\n\n*IMHO definitely install the latest Nvidia drivers, especially in High Sierra. Apple seems to touch them on the surface, but you will not get proper updates of the underlying driver.\n", "Q: How to find a .peg file on iPhone? I found this problem showing up on El Capitan Photos.\n\nDoes anybody know how to find the .peg file?\nAdditionally, I think this error is related to why some of my photos are not being imported into Photos.

ALternatively, is there a better way to achieve this? \n\n*Will I lose the data on the SSD? (I was lulled into the comfort of quiet speed and have quite a bit of work not backed up.  Mea culpa)\n\n\nA: It may be fried, although 4 years is much shorter than expected lifetime.\nWhen it was \"was chugging along nicely\" until now, I think a FW update will not succeed, nor be the cause of this stroke. It may be too full also.\nI suppose that you already tried to see it in the Recovery Partition (start with CMD+R) and \"repair disk\" it with DiskUtility.\n", "Q: Why can't find you open source software in the app store? Why do you need macports or homebrew to get open source software installed? Why can't you find this kind of software in the app store?\n\nA: You can find open source in the app store e.g. The Unarchiver source is on BitBucket\nHowever app store only provides apps and these have to be standalone and not depend on other apps and have other restrictions, thus Unarchiver suggests you download from outside the App Store\nMost things in Macports and Homebrew are command line tools or at least launched from the command line so could not be in App Store. Also historically Macports and Homebrew existed before the app store\nThere are also license issues to go in the App Store you have to include some Apple non open source code - for some licences e.g. GPL this can't be done - if you get all the coders to agree you can do this but if only one contributor disagrees then the app can't go in the App Store e.g. vlc\n", "Q: How do I tell Safari not to change the active tab on the error console when I reload a page?

How do I stop this deliberately stupid behavior? \n\nA: Close the Resources tab then it always stays on the tab where you are on every reload\n\nA: Usually I open the developer tools by using the \"Inspect Element\" context menu, and get the same behaviour as you describe (automatically switching to the Resource tab).\nSo I experimented and found an answer: If you open the developer tools to the Console tab by selecting Develop > Show Error Console from the menu, it will stay on the Console tab after a page refresh.\nAlso, if you open the developer tools using the \"Toggle Web Inspector\" icon or the Develop > Show Web Inspector menu item, it will stay on whatever tab you have selected after a page refresh.\n", "Q: Can I have My Photo Stream upload only? I have a iPad and a iPhone. My iPhone don't have enough storage so I want to disable downloading photo from Photo Stream. However, I do want iPhone to upload the photos to Photo stream and access & download it on my iPad. Is their anyway I can do this? Thanks!\n\nA: What you want to do is enable iCloud Photo Library on all devices, and then disable photo stream (or at least optimise storage) on your mobile devices. iCloud Photo Library is the actual cloud storage, while Photo Stream is just syncing between your devices (and not the cloud).\nNote that Photo Stream only keeps your last 1000 items downloaded on a device. Photo Stream provides no backup if you lose all devices at the same time (if you carry them all with you and something happens).\n", "Q: How do I list my unwatched iTunes purchases on Apple TV? I'm thinking of \"cutting the cord\" and getting an Apple TV, and then buying an iTunes \"season pass\" for each of the TV shows I'm watching.\nDoes Apple TV provide a good way to list/find the episodes that I haven't watched yet, without having to wade through all the series, seasons, and episodes that I've already watched?  As time goes on, it seems like there would be a build-up of watched shows that would make it harder and harder to find the unwatched ones.\nApparently Hulu has a feature like this called \"watchlist\", but I can't find any information on a similar feature for shows purchased a-la-carte from Apple.  The closest I've seen is that you can apparently hide past purchases.\n\nA: Apple TV used to have a feature that let you see a list of unwatched shows.

In that case, you'll need to download a tool to fix the library or upgrade iPhoto.\nYou certainly don't need iPhoto on the new mac unless you a) want it b) it helps you in upgrading an old library.\nBasically, don't erase the old Mac or backups and jump in. We're here if you run into a specific error in the process.\n", "Q: What is a software or app that extracts old flip phone data to a Mac via USB? UPDATE, here is how I got the photos out.\n\nI'm looking for a software, preferably free, that can extract old flip phone data to a MacBook Pro. I have some photos and sound recording saved on my Samsung AT&T SGH-a687 phone with a broken gpu (so I can't see anything). These are not saved on the SD card. \nThe manual of the phone doesn't seem to have an option to transfer photos and sounds out. So I would like to have a software that can extract all those phone data for me via USB onto my computer.\nI tried downloading a trial version of DataPilot, but that appeared to just be an updater, not the actual DataPilot. (I also hope it isn't a malware.)\nIf there is nothing free, what are the software you'd recommend me using? I'm willing to pay up to around $50.\nBtw, I have a backup PC, if there's an extraction software for a PC, that would work too.\n\nA: Have you tried contacting any local stores your phone provider has? It's becoming less common nowadays as basic phones are no longer the norm but back in the day they had a machine they could connect your phone to and transfer information out of it then on to a different phone.\nMaybe you could call around to local stores and see if any of them still have such machine.\nOtherwise, I did a bit of research because I used to know of some software that was for advanced phone modification before smartphones came around however it had a small feature to also see saved files.\nI can't seem to find the software I remember using anymore, however I did find BitPim:\n\nBitPim is a program that allows you to view and manipulate data on many CDMA phones from LG, Samsung, Sanyo and other manufacturers. This includes the PhoneBook, Calendar, WallPapers, RingTones (functionality varies by phone) and the Filesystem for most Qualcomm CDMA chipset based phones. To see when phones will be supported, which ones are already supported and which features are supported, see online help.\nhttp://www.bitpim.org/\n\nIt seems very similar to the software I used to use, however I've never used it before so I can not offer any help with it other than this YouTube video I found.\n", "Q: Advice on “leanest” package manager for OS X? Hope this is the right place to ask the following question:\nI want to install Octave on my Macbook Air, which means I need a package manager. I had Homebrew installed previously, but I got the impression the manager took a huge bite out of my (rather limited) HDD space, possibly as well (or even: mainly) due to the necessary libraries.\nAny advice on which OS X package manager I should get if HDD space is the main concern, and any advice how to use it to limit space impact?\n\nA: The size of your package manager will be trivial (20 MB) compared to the data it needs for your packages (golang clocks in at 250 MB, node at 37 MB). I'd say stick with Homebrew and work with it if you find some libraries are causing large space usages.\nMy thoughts are what specifically are your HDD space concerns? You could install brew and the files it needs on an external volume, but my guess is you have other files that could be co-located elsewhere - even on an SD card if you can't accommodate these files on the boot volume.\nHere are some target numbers for a clean install of OS X 10.11 with the store Xcode and homebrew installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*5.4 GB for /System\n\n*5.1 GB for /private _( most of that is the RAM sleep image on a 16 GB Mac)\n\n*2.4 GB for /Library\n\n*1.1 GB for /Applications (and you could need an additional 5 GB for the full Xcode if you wish to carry that around - most of it isn't needed for command line and open source compilation)\n\n*0.3 GB for /Users\n\n\nSo between 14.5 GB of minimal filesystem usage to 20 GB if you carry all of Xcode simulators and SDK for iOS, tvOS, Mac OS that are easily thinned if you only want command line tools.\nBasically, even if you have a high cost/low storage capacity 64 GB SSD drive to boot your Mac, it's likely not full of system or tools, but what you've brought to run.\n", "Q: Any way to recover photos from a restored iPhone? I accidentally restored my new iPhone 6+ (iOS 9), which didn't have iCloud enabled, from an old backup (iOS 8), with iCloud.\nMy important photos seem to be gone now. Is there any way to recover photos from a restored iPhone?\n\n\nA: Since you didn't link your photos to anything online, you may be able to go to a data recovery specialist and ask them to try to recover the photos, but it probably won't work (Depends on how large your backup is). \nIf you don't do that or that doesn't work, then you can't get your photos back anymore.\n", "Q: Stopped sync of photo's with iTunes, iPhone still claims little storage is used due to sync I recently stopped the synchronisation of photo's with iTunes on my iPhone. My iPhone removed all photo's it was still showing thanks to this synchronisation, but it still claims some storage is used due to synchronisation of photo's with iTunes. \nI'm talking about 0.7 kB. I know it's not much, but nevertheless I'm wondering what it is used for.\n\nA: While I am unsure of the EXACT details of what may be left in that 0.7KB I  know your phone saves information about what computer it connects to so it knows it can trust it for syncing files, updating software, backing up, and so on. Along with information about what you do and do not want to be synced on the phone. All of that information is still needed whether you sync everything or nothing but would take up a very tiny amount of space, as you can see.\n", "Q: Speaker on when headset plugged in I would like to keep my headset plugged into my iPhone 5S but have the ringer audible from the phone when I don't have the earbuds in my ears.  is this possible?   I don't like to have to hurry up and plug in my headset when a call comes in and I sometimes miss calls when it is plugged in and I don't have the earbuds in my ears.\n\nA: Yes indeed it is possible.

Your iPhone will ring even with the earphones plugged in. \n", "Q: What is AppSC extremely slowing down my MacBook Pro? I noticed that my OS X very frequently runs extremely slow and everything lags. I opened up Activity Monitor and I saw that something called AppSC is using up to 95% of the memory. It makes my computer run very hot. I immediately Force Quit the program when I notice it but it keeps happening.\nDoes anyone know what AppSC is?\n\nA: AppSC is malware. Download, install and run the free app Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac. It will detect it and you will be asked to remove it (and some other potentially installed malware).\nIf you can't download/install the anti-malware app because everything is sluggish, you have to move or remove the responsible plist file(s) in /Users/your_user_name/Library/LaunchAgents/, /Library/LaunchAgents/ or /Library/LaunchDaemons/ manually by booting to Single User Mode or to Recovery Mode. Remove the responsible plist file by cd'ing to one of the directories and mv'ing or rm'ing it. I don't remember precisely but I think the file name contains *.appsc.* or *.appscd.*. If you are running El Capitan you might have to disable System Integrity Protection. Then continue booting or reboot to your main volume and try again downloading, installing and running Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac.\n\nI recently got hands on a client's iMac infected with AppSC and some other malware. I've suspected MacKeeper (which was \"installed\" also) as the main culprit but I haven't been able to substantiate my assumption.\nTo remove the malware I first booted to a thumb drive containing a full OS X Mavericks and then - after investigating modify/create dates of several apps and folders - moving suspicious launch agents/daemons in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchDaemons to inert folders like /Library/LaunchDaemons (Off). Then I booted to the main volume and installed the aforementioned software and uninstalled/deleted all malware files.\nAppSC (accompanied by an AppSC daemon which starts AppSC while booting and restarts AppSC after force quitting it) just \"eats\" RAM with a rate of 50 MB-300 MB/s. Immediately after starting the iMac about 6 GB of 8 GB RAM were free. After all free RAM is gone the whole system swaps with a slightly slower rate. After one minute the client's iMac had a swap size of 4 GB with no other apps running. \nMemory swapping will slow down your OS X and all running regular apps and after a while it's almost impossible to do anything even rebooting.\n\nA: Whatever it is, it's definitely not normal and it is caused by 3rd party software. I can't find out anything about it on the internet, so you should probably take your computer into an Apple Store and have them look at it. I would need to see the path to the executable to figure it out.

I've tried the process about 10 times now with the same result every time.\nAnyone have any idea what could be going wrong or how I get a more descriptive error out of the Boot Camp process?\nI'm on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) and my Boot Camp version is 6.0.0. I'm using a Windows 10 ISO downloaded directly from Microsoft and I've tried downloading multiple times and comparing the file hash to confirm that the ISO isn't getting corrupted.\n\nA: I was getting this error as well. In my case the initial download was completing, and then the supremely unhelpful \"Can't install the software\" error was popping up. There was nothing in system.log to indicate why.\nI eventually figured out that it was due to the fact that I was running Boot Camp Assistant as a non-administrative user (for security reasons my day-to-day user is non-admin). Even though, as with most apps that require admin privileges, it asks for an admin password when run as a non-admin user, in the case of this particular app it doesn't work. You must actually be logged in as an admin user. \nAlso, make sure you don't have any other users logged in or any other apps running while you are doing the Boot Camp setup, or it may hang at the last minute.\nOverall this is a flaky bit of software. When it works it's great, but it copes spectacularly badly with failure. The fact that it insists on re-downloading the support software every time is particularly galling (have these people never heard of rsync?) when you end up running it dozens of times trying to get it to work... \n\nA: TLDR: Was able to get it to work after trying many times.\nThis error appears to be a truncated version of the \"Can't download the software because of a network problem\" error. On previous versions of Boot Camp it was possible to defer the Support Software download until after Windows was installed. This is no longer possible with Boot Camp 6.\nIt appears the issue was with Apple's servers and trying over and over again eventually yielded success. It took around 30 attempts over the course of several hours. It wasn't a network issue as I was able to successfully connect to other servers and I could see data being transferred from an Apple CDN. The issue has affeced other people as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7314995\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6759062\nI imagine this will be something Apple eventually sorts out with their servers and / or the Boot Camp software.

I use the charger from Apple.\n\nA: No you cannot overcharge it because careful account is made of the charge in the cells by internal circuitry which will not charge the battery when it is fully charged. Many of the technologies involved in modern, power dense batteries react very badly indeed to overcharging, so much so that a little circuit, usually built into the battery itself, acts as a kind of charge \"accountant\" to ensure it's impossible for things to get out-of-hand.\n\nA: Yes you can damage your Iphone 5c if you charge it when it is already full BUT, the iphone 5c (and all iphones)  has built in battery management system that will not allow the battery to be charged once it is full.  \nSo if you plug it in and try to charge it when it is full, the battery protection will kick in and prevent any charging from ocurring.  So you have nothing to worry about.

How can I get them back? The Problem\nI got a new iPhone 6 a while ago, and after restoring from an iCloud backup over wifi, all of the photos/videos in my Photos app show up grey.\nIt's as if my phone knows the photos should be there, but doesn't have the actual data for them. It also seems to know which ones should be videos, and even has their duration, but no video data is actually present. Maybe it only has the meta-data? \nThe Photos app doesn't crash if I try to view them; they just show up grey. I've taken new photos since then, and they show up okay in the app, but the old photos remain grey.\nHere are some screenshots of the Photos app from my iPhone:\n\n\nBackstory\nHere's some background information to give you some context around my problem.\nIt's Sept 27 and it's time to upgrade to a new iPhone. For whatever reason, I decided to backup my iPhone to iCloud over wifi, instead of connecting my phone to my computer and backing up via iTunes like I normally do. I'm not sure if it was running iOS 8.4 or 9 at the time I made the backup. I got my new iPhone, which I think was on iOS 9, and I restored it from my iCloud backup over wifi.\nThe restore seemed successful, but all of apps still said \"Waiting...\". My phone sat there for hours and hours but nothing changed. Maybe Apple's servers were just busy due to everyone upgrading to the newly released iPhone 6s.  Thinking something was wrong, I wiped it and tried to restore it again from iCloud backup, but the same thing happened. \nEventually over the next day or so my apps finally download. Everything seemed okay until I noticed my photos hadn't turned up yet: they were all grey as pictured above. Maybe they just didn't download yet? I waited a week: still nothing. Finally after about a month of procrastination, I decided to post a question here as you are reading now.\nCurrent Situation\nAt this point I feel like I did something wrong and iCloud didn't backup my photos. The old iPhone has since been wiped, so no chance to get them back from that phone. At least I have a backup on my computer as recent as June 29, so if I restore from that I'll only have lost about 3 months of photos.\nNow what made me decide to post this question instead of just restoring from that backup is the hope that there's something I can do to get them all back. Maybe I'm forgetting something and I can still get all the photo data from my backup.\nI'm also curious to see if anyone knows if I did anything wrong when I tried to backup/restore via iCloud. Maybe I had an incorrect iCloud setting; I don't really know. When I made my iCloud backup, it said \"Photos\" was ON. Did I have to switch \"iCloud Photo Library\" ON too?\nHere's some screenshots of my iCloud settings:\n\n\nSummary\nSo at this point, is there any way to get all my photos back into my Camera Roll? Did I do something wrong when I backed up to iCloud?\nHere's how I sit now:\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPhone has about 300 greyed out photos/videos up until Sept 27, and then some \"good\" photos from then onward that I've taken since I did the backup/restore.\n\n*I have a June 29 backup on my computer I can restore to as a last resort if there's nothing I can do to get the greyed out photos working again. If I go this route, I'll lose 3 months of photos from June 29 - Sept 27. \n\nA: Turns out I solved the issue by just wiping my phone and restoring it from that same Sept 27 iCloud backup again. It had the photos in the backup after all. As to why it didn't download them to my phone when I restored from that backup a month ago, I'll probably never know.\nBefore I actually wiped/restored, I wanted to make sure that the backup actually had the photos in it. Of course Apple doesn't let you see the data in your backups, so I had to download a 3rd party backup viewer on my mac to look at the pictures in the backup file. Once I saw the photos were really there in iCloud, I decided to just restore from that backup and see what happens. It ended up working. Weird.\n\nA: I have the same issue going from iPhone 5 with 9.0.1 to an 6s with 9.0.1. Most of my photos returned as grey.  I ended up just sending all the ones I wanted to keep to my new phone via AirDrop.\n", "Q: iPhones and automatic 911 calls Can an iPhone6 automatically dial 911?

I do not believe anyone else made the two calls (first call was 1 minute, second call was 3 minutes) and I feel certain that I did not.\n\nA: As far as I am aware, there is no function to automatically dial 911.\nHowever, anyone with possession of an iPhone can dial an emergency call from the lock screen without unlocking the phone. \nWhether that's more likely than you dialing and not remembering it (whether amnesia immediately following a trauma, or shock from the impact to your body or head is hard to guess as an outsider that wasn't there.\n", "Q: Is there an app that's similar to Calendar + Wunderlist? I'm constantly switching between the two, and it's driving me crazy being so disorganized. I use Wunderlist as a to-do list. I'll create a list, titled with the date, and list the things I need to do that day. So every date requires the creation of a list; sometimes I'll have 10-20 lists when I need to plan further ahead, and it gets tricky when I have something coming up weeks or months ahead of time. The issue is, it's hard looking ahead to see what's been planned, what appointments I have, etc. (I know searching is possible, but that's not the same as having an overview of the next few days or weeks).\nWhen I use Apple's Calendar, I essentially do the same thing, each day is a to-do list. But when in month -- the view I find most helpful -- I can't arrange the orders of the items I create. I have to either go to day view or week view and drag it, or set a time, which can be very tedious if done for each item. Week view can also be quite annoying because there's no ability to scroll horizontally (like you would with a webpage or pdf), it jumps week by week, making planning ahead sort of tricky for me. So essentially, I end up creating an unordered list.\nIs there an app that can address these issues? I'm aware that there organization / productivity / calendar apps that are loaded with features, but cost a good amount of money.

Furthermore, will allow you to set reminders for every item in your lists.\nThe app is really minimal which help you keep organised. Another feature of the app is that the higher an item or a list is in your app, then the higher the priority is and therefore the colour (first item is dark red, indicating importance and the last one yellow, indicating not that important).\nIs also available for iOS (iPhone, iPad), Apple Watch and Mac OS X, and sync over iCloud to keep everything synchronized.\nIs not free though, but for me is my main to-do organiser app for a long time, so for me, worth it's money.\n", "Q: speed up iOS9 on iPad 4?

One day I plugged it to my computer and tried to charge it. The charging light doesn't blink, and it looks like the iPod is already dead.\nCan someone help me to solved this problem? How can I revive it?\n\nA: My shuffle began to give me difficulty with charging as well. I use it frequently when I exercise but often when I would try to connect it to the charger, the charge light would not turn on. Repeated attempts, rotating the iPod so that it was engaging the cable in various orientations, would sometimes result in success. I figured the internal connectors were to blame. Had the same problem on multiple shuffles. Then I noticed a bit of green discoloration at the base of the connector cable & wondered if the problem might be with the cable, not the iPod. I sprayed the connector with contact cleaner & sanded it with fine grit sandpaper until the green was gone & the contact areas had been roughed up a bit. Sprayed with contact cleaner again & went to try it out. Now all seems well, even with old shuffles I had thought were permanently unusable. Now I have 4 shuffles, all charged & working. Examine the connector on your charging cable & make sure it looks clean!\n\nA: Your ipod shmuffle is powered by a lithium ion (lithium polymer) battery.  These are great batteries because they have a high amount of energy for their weight allowing Apple to keep the ipod small and light.\nHowever, the lithium ion battery is very susceptible to damage and even fire and possible explosion if they are not kept within a very strict temperature and voltage range. \nTo ensure this, Apple has added a 'battery management system' chip to the battery that runs the battery charging and discharging.  This chip controls the current, the maximum and minimum voltage of the battery, and the charging algorithm.  Also, if the temperature of the battery is too high or low, it will turn off the battery.\nThis is great as it protects the battery (and you) from damage.  But there is a down side, and the downside is that this battery management system or protection circuit board as it is sometimes called, uses a very small amount of battery power itself.  If you haven't used your ipod for a long time, and the battery wasn't at a full charge, it is possible that the battery management system drained your battery. The problem is that there is a minimum safe voltage below which a lithium battery should not be charged. Your battery has probable reached this voltage and so the protection circuit has purposely shutoff the charging circuit so you can't charge the battery.  \nIt is also possible that over the long period of time that the ipod sat idle, some kind of damage occurred to the battery management system and as a result charging does not occur.  I have seen this happen a lot with laptop batteries.\nEdit:  when I think about it, I thought that Apple had within their battery management system a policy for long term storage that would essentially turn off the battery management system to avoid over draining the battery.  It might be that you just need to plug it in for a period of time to 'wake up' the circuitry and then it will charge.  Try for 20 minutes or less and don't leave it alone when you try - the Apple website also suggests that it may take up to 20 minutes after long term storage for an ipod to start charging again.\nDo not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\nPower down the device to avoid additional battery use.\nPlace your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less than 90° F (32° C).\nFrom the Apple support website:\n\"Depending on how long you store your device, it may be in a low-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After it’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with the original adapter before you can use it.\"\nWhat I was describing above, if the ipod is in storage long enough, the battery could be in a too-low state and not be able to be charged safely.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Microsoft RDP Crash on launch I work for a primarily Microsoft based IT support company, anyway today a Mac user asked me to setup RDP which I wouldn't normally have any issues with but I got onto the Mac and installed the latest RDP client from the app store (this was updated a couple days ago).\nAnyway when I try to launch it from launchpad I get a crash every time, I tried reinstalling but it still does the exact same.\nI am not experienced with Mac's at all so I am finding it hard to troubleshoot this, can anyone shed some light on this or point me in the right direction?\nProcess:         launchd [571]\nPath:            /Applications/Microsoft Remote Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Remote Desktop\nIdentifier:      com.microsoft.rdc.mac\nVersion:         ???

On some models, the projector has its own volume control and you can't modify the volume using the volume keys on your Mac. If you try to do so, an icon similar to what you have posted appears. You have to use the volume control on the projector's remote.\nThe same is happening here. Your speakers have their own volume control. Therefore, OS X can't control it.\nIn some other cases, OS X will allow you to \"change\" the volume, but this change is only apparent on your Mac. For example, in some TVs with HDMI ports, you can change the volume using the volume keys when using it as an external display, but the sound output will be of the same loudness. You have to use the TV remote to change the volume.\nYou can confirm this by going to  > System Preferences > Sound. The output tab will say \"this device has no output controls\" and you can't modify the volume.\n\nA: Pipe it through https://github.com/mLupine/SoundflowerBed and you can control display port output from the mac into it. \n:)\n", "Q: How to write ExifTool keywords which Spotlight can see? I try to write keywords to PNG images using ExifTool but OS X's Spotlight cannot see these keywords at all.\nThe developer of ExifTool does not know about Spotlight, so he cannot help: \n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if spotlight doesn't parse metadata in PNG images.  But I'm not the one to ask about this.  I don't know much about how spotlight works.\"\n\nI have tried many different variations of this but Spotlight don't see my keywords:\n/usr/local/bin/exiftool -api PNGEarlyXMP 1 -api IgnoreMinorErrors 1 -Keywords+=\"my keyword\" -overwrite_original_in_place -P path_is_here.png\n\nLimitations in Spotlight, Preview, and Photoshop\nApple Spotlight and Preview (OS X 10.8.5) and Adobe Photoshop CC (version 14.0) ignore XMP in PNG images if it comes after the image data, which is where ExifTool adds new XMP. This should be considered as a bug in the Apple and Adobe software since XMP is allowed to exist after the image data according to the XMP and PNG specifications. [ExifTool 9.40 provides the PNGEarlyXMP API option to allow writing XMP before the IDAT chunk, but there are caveats associated with its use]\nPNGEarlyXMP\nExifTool's Flag to write XMP in PNG images before the IDAT (image data) chunk. By default, ExifTool adds new XMP to the end of a PNG file (just before IEND). This is allowed by the PNG and XMP specifications, but some utilities seem to ignore XMP if it comes after the image data. The PNGEarlyXMP option causes ExifTool to instead add new XMP before the PNG IDAT chunk. However, since ExifTool uses a single-pass writing algorithm, it has no way to tell if XMP already exists later in the file before writing the new XMP in this location. If this happens, a minor error is issued when the extra XMP is encountered, and the file is not written. Adding the IgnoreMinorErrors option causes the XMP after IDAT to be deleted, thus resolving the conflict (at the expense of possible metadata loss), and allowing the file to be written. The PNGEarlyXMP option is applied automatically when deleting all XMP and writing new XMP back in one step. When reading, this option causes a warning to be issued if standard XMP is found after the IDAT chunk.\nIgnoreMinorErrors\nFlag to ignore minor errors. Causes minor errors to be downgraded to warnings, and minor warnings to be ignored. This option is provided mainly to allow writing of files when minor errors occur, but by ignoring some minor warnings the behaviour of ExifTool may be changed to allow some questionable operations to proceed (such as extracting thumbnail and preview images even if they don't have a recognizable header). Minor errors/warnings are denoted by \"[minor]\" at the start of the message, or \"[Minor]\" (with a capital \"M\") for warnings that affect processing when ignored.\n\nA: As of OS X 10.11, this appears not to be possible.\nJPEG but not PNG\nThat you can not find a working example suggests the Spotlight indexer does not extract the meta-data from Portable Network Graphics, png, files.\nAccording to Searching EXIF data with Mac OS X Spotlight, it does work for jpeg files.\nFile an Enhancement Bug\nReport an enhancement bug through Apple's Bug Reporting web site – and through general OS X feedback. This is the best way to directly tell Apple what you want.\n", "Q: Snow Leopard OS X Partition (El Capitan) I have a couple things I'm trying to do that I can't find a solution for.\nThe end goal is to be able to run DVD Studio Pro 4 on my Mac which has El Capitan installed. The software is pretty old but I need it for a client so I'm trying to figure out a way to get Snow Leopard installed on a partition that I set up on my drive. The only real reason I need Snow Leopard (10.6) is because it's the last version of OS X that runs 'Rosetta' which is required to run PowerPC application (which DVD Studio Pro is).\nI set up a partition, plugged in my Apple USB SuperDrive (I have a Mid 2014 Macbook Pro so I no longer have a disc drive), put the Mac OS X 10.6 installer in, rebooted the computer and tried to boot it from disc by holding 'C'. It recognizes the command then opens up the old Apple start screen so I know it even recognizes the disc in the drive since it's clearly pulling up an old OS X start screen. The issue is that it never gets past that initial screen. I'm not sure if I need to wait it out longer but I've let it run for 10 minutes with no result.\nI then tried to boot holding 'Option' but my SuperDrive didn't show up as one of the options.\nI then went into the contents of the disc itself because technically I can install Rosetta because it's part of the 'Optional Installs' for that operating system and if I can just run Rosetta it will solve my problems. Of course when I try to proceed the Mac gives me a pretty strongly worded warning that I probably shouldn't do it because this old software is not compatible with the current OS installed on my computer (the whole reason I was trying to create a partition anyway).\nTo clarify, I can't just run the installer off the disk for the OS because the application is actually a PowerPC application and has the 'no' symbol on top of the application so I can't run the installer directly.\nMy main questions are:\n- Is there a way to just install the OS on the partition without doing the reboot? And if so, will it work running a PowerPC installer on my Intel Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it ok for me to install Rosetta directly on my El Capitan system? (I know the answer is likely 'no' but just thought I'd ask in case...)\n\n*Is there another boot approach I could try to get past that first screen?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I think your best bet is to buy a copy of Snow Leopard Server on eBay. Unlike regular Snow Leopard, you can run it in a virtual machine, so install VirtualBox. Parallels or VMWare Fusion and you should be able to install and run it.\n\nA: You usually can't install an \"old\" operating system on newer Macs. It usually doesn't provide necessary drivers for the newer hardware.\nThe preinstalled OS X on your Mac probably was OS X 10.9.4 (13E28). Older OSs like Mountain Lion (10.8) or Lion (10.7) probably don't run on your MBP and certainly not Snow Leopard.\nThe only legal option you (and your client) have is purchasing Snow Leopard Server and a type-2-hypervisor like Parallels and VMware Fusion or the free Oracle VirtualBox. Install SL Server and all necessary apps (like DVD Studio Pro 4) in a VM.\n\nA: Wanted to add my findings here. Needed to install 10.6 on a 10.11.6 machine that started as a 10.6 iMac. We need 10.6 to connected to some scientific equipment. 10.11.6 iMac will not run the 10.6.3 installer and not will boot from the 10.6.3 install DVD.\nUsing an old MacBook Pro put the iMac into target disk mode. Created a new partition for 10.6 and ran the installer. Install completed, booted to the 10.11.6 partition successfully and can see the file structure of 10.6.3. The Boot Manager recognizes the 10.6.3 partition. However it will not boot to the 10.6.3 partition. Just hangs at the grey loading screen with the Apple. \nI believe that an EFI change has occurred and will not allow 10.6 to initialize. Looking into a copy of 10.6 server and using parallels. \n\nA: I went this route but don't get any sound unless I install a third party sound card and drivers and under VMWare this gets kinda screwy\nConsider buying an old Mac off eBay?\nI bought a very fast G4 PowerMac for a fiver! \n\nA: Best guess, install snow leopard on an external hard drive, on a machine that will run snow leopard. Then after successfully testing that snow leopard will run that computer from the external hard drive. Shut down that computer, (The one you use to load the external hard drive with snow leopard) unplug the external hard drive. \nWith the other computer shut downed, plug the external hard drive into the Computer running the more up-to-date operating system. Then go to system preferences to check to see if the external hard drive is an option in startup disk. If so select the startup disk with the snow leopard operating system and restart. Good luck.\n\nA: The last standalone OS which Apple put on the market as a bootable DVD was Snow Leopard 10.6.3. Modern Intel machines, in general all those which were born (or were later updated) to run Lion (or any following Mac OS), won't let you boot from DVD (your Mac would get stuck on Apple gray logo/spinning wheel). Some late aluminum Macpros (5,1), though, came equipped with an updated DVD, containing OSX Snow Leopard installer 10.6.4, which would allow your Mac to boot from DVD and let you install Snow Leopard on a new drive/partition. You could buy one of those updated DVDs on ebay from a previous Macpro 5,1 owner.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s stuck at Apple logo and progress bar iPhone stuck at Apple logo, so I decided to restore it using iTunes app. After successfully restoring it (extracting software, verifying iPhone SW/FW etc.), it rebooted. As I've seen on many forums, as next step it should display the slide to setup screen. But it displays only the progress bar (again!). This time it stuck at ~ 5-10% every time I try. \nI have followed all the instructions (update iTunes, drivers, I've also disabled all services except MS and APPLE). Reinstalled iTunes. Used different USB ports, tried on another PC. Sometimes it even displays a blue screen. But thats rarely. So basically, I can't access the phone. \n\nA: As I wasnt here for a longer period of time, here is what did I do to solve this: \nI finally managed to boot the phone. Here is what I did.\nAfter I've already tried on another computer, a customer brought me a desktop PC (before I had 2 laptops). I installed Win 8.1, previous laptops have win 10. So from this point of view, I gained hope.\nA fresh installed OS, newly downloaded iTunes.  As next, I've connected the device to the PC which succesfully installed new Apple drivers (I was carefull at those events).\nSo I ran into DFU mode (power off > sleep/wake + home button > release sleep/wake button). It successfully detected it in 'recovery mode'.  I chose RESTORE. I had the notification for the new 9.1 (which usually wasn't here - except probably for the first time I ran the app on other PCs), And as next the Restore button greyed out. I thought it was 'frozen'. As I checked in the task manager, the iTunes process was using network, which was meaning it downloads the new large 9.1 iOS.\nWhen it installed, everything was as usual. Finished the extracting, verifying...that it rebooted and disappeared from iTunes. With no other option left, I decided to let it install, even if for hours. BUt then I unplugged it and saw low battery.  When I began with charging, after few minutes a vibration with \"Hello\" screen appeared.\nI would advice other who have the same issue to be careful at these steps.\n", "Q: How can I stop iOS updates from downloading automatically via Wi-Fi, on my iPhone 6s with iOS 9.0.2? This may be more of a question on what Ask Different community thinks of me than a technical question on iOS 9 updates.\nThanks to Alex Malcoci here, now I know how to stop the reminder about iOS update installation from popping up every day on my iPhone 6s with iOS 9.0.2. Also thanks to bmike on the same post, now I know that Apple doesn't provide users an option to turn off automatic download of iOS updates on devices with iOS upper than 9.x.x. I also learned from another post on Ask Different that I can, despite bmike's advice above, turn off automatic download of updates via mobile data.\nSo, the only problem left for me is the automatic download of iOS updates, which contain features and fixes that are most of times totally unnecessary and irrelevant for me, via Wi-Fi connection. As a sensible way to cut down my mobile data use, I leave my iPhone 6s connected to Wi-Fi at my house and disconnected from mobile data, whenever I'm home. I don't have problem with the storage space on my iPhone even if updates are downloaded automatically via Wi-Fi, since I still have about 20GB left empty on my device.\nBut still, I want to stop automatic download of iOS updates via Wi-Fi connection, and be able to choose which update to download and install. This is absolutely a matter of like or dislike, and not something that's causing difficulty or annoyance on use of my phone. So far.\nAm I a social outcast who wishes to take control of what's downloaded to my device by resisting Apple's forced download policy, and who also deserves to stop living with Apple devices, if I dislike so much the automatic download? Which is more crazy, me disliking or Apple forcing?\n\nA: Apple isn't 'forcing' downloads on you, but instead is making it convenient and easy to stay up to date on Apple software. That may sound like a spin on the point of view, but Apple doesn't want you on the latest release so they can crow to the press about update percentages.\nThey do this for at least two reasons: 1) it reduces their support costs, as customers migrate off older code, and 2) it provides critical security updates and bug fixes that may put your device and data at risk. \nApple does drop support for older OS (if you have an original iPad, you know it is 'stuck' on iOS 5).\nAutomatic download of the updates does not mean that you are forced to take the update, it just means the update package has been downloaded to your device. Installation is still something you must approve, and kickoff. The phone will not update the OS without your input. \nYou won't suffer from new features or anything in the new updates until you apply them, so other than using some storage space, there is no downside to having it downloaded in the background.\nSomething to consider: Apple includes many security updates within its OS updates, most of which are (sadly) not well documented in the update notice. skipping these updates may put your device, and data, at risk.\n", "Q: Mail attachement problem I have a problem with mail application. \nUsing it from OS X when I send mail including an attachment like image, pdf or any oder document and if my recipient reads the mail on windows devices, they do not see the text of my mail and a signature, but instead the whole text and signature of the email all are processed as an attachment. \nLIKE THIS... \n\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015), iOS 9.1, OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5\n\nA: You can try Universal Mailer Plugin to Apple Mail.\nIt has options to keep signature text formatting as well as how to treat images in the message.\n", "Q: OS X: Shift + Delete = Forward delete annoyance Has anyone noticed this strange behavior of OS X El Capitan regarding forward delete? The usual keyboard shortcut for this on keyboards that have no distinct forward delete button is fn + delete, which works on my MacBook Pro 13'' Early 2015 as it should.\nAdditionally I have a forward delete when holding down shift and delete. This is so annoying because it happens very often while writing larger texts (especially in German where you have a lot of capital lettered words) or programming that this situation occurs.\nDoes anyone know a way to remap/deactivate forward delete?\n\nA: This is a change in behavior in the 10.11.2 beta, build 15C27e. Wether or not this is intentional or a mistake is unclear. But it is infuriating.\n\nA: Assuming you only see this in Textwrangler: You can change it in Preferences:\n\n\nA: There's no official setting to change it afaik, but there is a workaround to basically overwrite the system's Shift+Delete and map it to be just Delete. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and launch Karabiner.\n\n*Go to the Misc & Uninstall tab, and click the Open private.xml button. A Finder window to a folder with a file named private.xml should open.\n\n*Open the private.xml file and replace its contents with the following:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Shift+Delete to Backward Delete</name>\n    <identifier>private.fixbackspace</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DELETE, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, KeyCode::DELETE</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DELETE, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_R, KeyCode::DELETE</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\n*Go back to the Change Key tab. There should be a checkbox named \"Shift+Delete to Backward Delete\" in the list box (If you don't see it, click the Reload XML on the upper right corner). Select it.\nThat should fix the issue. In my case doing this for some reason also changed the delay between tapping a key and the key press being repeated. That's just a slider in System Preferences > Keyboard.\nBonus: Send feedback to Apple through the Feedback Assistant, or the online bug reporting site, or just wherever, so hopefully they fix this nonsense or at least add the a setting to change it.\nFrom the reddit thread linked to by fdnhkj.\n", "Q: How to update Windows 7 and Parallels Desktop 9 before updating to El Capitan I'm using a Mac for about 3 years now and updating OS X has never been an issue because it's free, but since I installed Parallels Desktop v9 and Windows 7 I'm reading issues about their compatibility on OS X 10.11 El Capitan where they are both not supported.\nSo upon coming to this issue I would rather ask an expert to tell me how to do it right and which should I upgrade first without damaging any of my files? Please kindly assist me step-by-step on how to do it properly.\n\nA: You should probably keep your apps up to date before installing an OS that you know will be incompatible with their older versions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a Time Machine backup of everything.\n\n*Update Parallels through this link. You'll get it for $49.99 (as opposed to $79.99) because you're upgrading from a relatively recent version.\n\n*Open the new Parallels and play around with your files to make sure everything works.\n\n*Once you're satisfied that the new version of Parallels works, take a new Time Machine backup.\n\n*Install El Capitan.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: What does Date Created in Finder mean? This sounds really stupid - but I bought my Mac (supposedly brand new) from a retailer friend in 2014, and I just found apps that are created in 2013 while going through Finder.\nDoes Date Created for apps & files in OS X can be not the exact date that it was installed on the Mac?\n\nA: In most cases, \"Date Created\" is the date you created the file. For example, if you write a document and save it, \"Today\" is the creation date.\nIf I check my Applications folder, I can see that \"App Store.app\" was created on June 18, 2015. However, it's impossible for it to have been installed on that date because I installed El Capitan on the USB drive I'm currently booted from just a couple weeks ago (in other words, in June 2015 I didn't own a bootable copy of El Capitan). This means that the \"Date Created\" was the date that the app itself was created and not when it was installed.\nIn some other cases (I can't find the file I'm thinking about right now but if I do I'll edit my answer) you can download files and they could retain their metadata. You can download a file created years before you even owned your computer. If the metadata is retained you could have a creation date that is before your owning of that computer (e.g. download a document written in 2013 on a 2014 laptop).\n", "Q: Swapping internal hard drives I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro into which I had installed an OWC data doubler SSD (removing the optical drive).  I originally placed the SSD in the original HDD bay and moved the HDD to the data doubler bracket in the optical bay.  I would like to switch these around (HDD back to its original bay).  I'm assuming I should be able to switch the two drives around with no negative repercussions to normal operation - i.e. this should not require a reformat/reinstallation of the boot drive (which is the SSD).  Would that be correct?\n\nA: I don't think that will be a problem, but you may initially need to hold the Alt key while booting and choose the Startup drive. If it still won't boot, reset PRAM with holding altcmdPR while booting. \n\nA: Just an FYI:  I had a similar setup in a 2011 MBP. It worked great for a while, but I started getting disk errors on the drive in the ex-optical bay. I think the disk interface was just not designed for heavy use \n", "Q: How to get Dictation to get audio feed? The double \"Fn\" button is starting Apple voice-dictation but it never comes up with a single word when i close the operation with \"Fn\" key. If I open the System Prefs for Audio Input I can see my voice is getting level so I don't understand why it won't parse anything I say. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Close dictation by clicking the 'done' button, not by pressing the Fn key again, unless you have given the process chance to finish typing what you said. \nEach time you pause, you ought to see the text so far, but pressing function will just close the window without any further return from the online process. Conversely if you click the Done button it will still finish off what you were saying, even if it's not yet had chance to parse it.\nIf you close the dictation box using the function button then you may not be giving the process chance to finish, In effect generating a Cancel rather than an Enter.\nThe time you need to wait before closing may be dependant on your connection speed.\nAs you are dictating you ought to be able to see the volume level in the microphone icon on the dictation pop-up.\n\nA: While I did have Sound> Input set to internal or webcam mic and neither worked, it seems the Internal Microphone was not selected on the Dictation & Speech> Diction tab. It got switched to Aggregate Group which I was playing with a few months ago (trying to generate multiple simultaneous outputs).\nSo yeah just needed that Mic selected on LHS of Diction preference.\n\n", "Q: What are \"Items\" in OS X Photos? In my Photos library, there are some mysterious \"items\" that are not Photos/Videos.

I noticed sometime after updating to Yosemite that Eclipse now launches very slowly. It takes 30 seconds to a minute to get to the startup splash screen, and after that it spends a minute or two initializing itself before the IDE comes up. \nI've seen this issue even after updating Eclipse. I went from Luna to Mars to Mars.1 and it is still a problem. I have a number of perspectives installed (Java, C/C++, Python, and JS), but these were installed and working admirably before the issue started.\nTried a few things mentioned in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/316265/how-can-you-speed-up-eclipse\n\n\n*\n\n*Increasing the amount of memory for the launcher and application in eclipse.ini (ctrl-click application -> Show Package Contents)\n\n*Updated Eclipse and all plugins\n\n\nI noticed immediately after changing eclipse.ini, Eclipse opens a lot faster. On subsequent launches it is slow again.\n\nA: I was able to resolve the issue.\nI inspected the logs and noticed the PyDev plugin was searching for a Python 2.5 interpreter (which had been installed on previous OS X installations). After I removed the Python 2.5 interpreter from PyDev's list of configured interpreters, the issue vanished.\n", "Q: Cloning Macbook Pro HD to external HD and still using it I am still on Mavericks and want to upgrade OS X, but since I use a lot of audio apps, plugins etc that would break - I am looking for a way to clone my entire Macbook Pro 1TB SSD as it is right now including OS X to an external 1TB drive. I then want to do a fresh install on the Macobook, but still be able to boot into the Maverick clone from the TB HHD to finish older projects, so I don't have to port everything.\nWhat's the best and especially savest way of doing this?\n\nA: I have had good luck by booting into recovery mode and using Disk Utility to clone the drive before doing major OS X upgrades.\nThe steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your USB drive.\n\n*Boot your Mac into recovery mode by holding down command+r from the start of boot.\n\n*Once the recovery menu comes up, select Disk Utility and click Continue.\n\n*Select the drive you want to clone and click the \"Restore\" tab.\n\n*Drag the destination (USB) drive to the \"Destination\" field.\n\n*Click \"Restore\".\n\n\nOnce the process is complete, reboot the computer and hold down alt / option and select the drive you've cloned to. This is good to be sure it's functional before upgrading OS X on the main drive. Some software will detect that something's different (Dropbox, Photoshop) and may ask for credentials or to be setup again. But the vast majority of software just works as if nothing happened.\n\nA: Sounds like a job for Carbon Copy Cloner; did you try it? http://bombich.com\n", "Q: How can I get back the thin monospace font on EI Capitan with PhpStorm 10? I found that after I updated my OS X to EI Capitan a few weeks ago, the fonts used in my terminal and PhpStorm 9 are made a bit thiner (I didn't change any settings in terminal and PhpStorm 9), I really like these thin fonts. Is this because of some font rendering settings in OS X? Because I didn't change any font settings in terminal and PhpStorm.\nBut after updated my PhpStorm to version 10 today, the font in PhpStorm went back to the bolder one (Menlo).\nAnybody knows how I can get back the thiner font in my PhpStorm?\n\nA: This is actually a new feature in PhpStorm 10. Open up PhpStorm's preferences and go to [Appearance & Behavior > Appearance]. Under the \"Antialiasing\" section, change \"Editor\" to \"Greyscale\". There are a few other options. Play with it and see what you like.\n", "Q: What is the \"128 font limit\" in classic Mac OS? I was reading about Bill Gates' famous \"640KB\" quote, when I came upon http://www.faktoider.nu/640kb_eng.html, a nice article about the quote and its historical context. However, the article also contained this curious paragraph:\n\nThis wasn't, of course, the first or last time such limits were set; all systems that handles memory, or does some other kind of addressing, have built-in limits somewhere, and when they are designed the limits are set comfortably high. But that doesn't mean the designer is convinced that the limit will suffice forever. (A similar example in the Macintosh world is the inital limit of 128 fonts - not on a single machine, but on all Macs, worldwide. This fact is somewhat less well known than the 640 kB-quote.) \n\n(emphasis mine). Now, that's a weird limit to have - worldwide, Macs could only have 128 distinct fonts? At what point was that ever true, and how could such a limit even work? Googling this suggested there was a limit of 128 font suitcases on classic Mac OS, but that applies to a single machine and not \"worldwide\". I couldn't find any other information about this font limit.\nSo what does this 128-font limit refer to?\n\nA: As per http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fonts_on_Macintosh, System versions 7 to 9 supported a maximum of 128 font suitcases and each suitcase could store multiple fonts.\nHowever, according to http://laegernelipkesgade.dk/Fonts/kptype/Kontrapunkt%20Typefaces/README.txt\nMacintosh System 9.x allows you to open 512 suitcases at once. Macintosh System 8.x and earlier only allow you to open 128 font suitcases at one time. If you exceed these limits, not all the fonts you install will work.\nIf you search for \"128\" you should find the above statements.\n", "Q: How to trap ssh breakin attempts on El Capitan Previous to El Capitan one could use pfctl and  /etc/pf.conf to \"trap\" the ip addresses of sites attempting to break into a server using brute force attacks producing 100's of attempts per second. The rules one created would put the offending ip addresses into an \"attackers\" table and then reject any connection attempts from that ip address. \nWith El Capitan, all port connections appear to be handled first by launchd and now the pfctl method has no effect. \nDoes anyone know how to adapt the pfctl approach to this new  connection logic?  The automatic detection rules were really effective. \n\nA: I don't believe pfctl was enabled by default in either Yosemite or El Capitan. You can still edit the /etc/pf.conf file, add rules, tables, etc., and then load and enable pfctl and you'll be up and running:\nsudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf -e\n\nSee http://128bitstudios.com/2010/06/13/stopping-ssh-brute-force-attacks-with-pf-on-freebsd for a really simple but effective way to get an SSH rule to prevent bruteforce attacks.\nAlso see http://krypted.com/mac-security/a-cheat-sheet-for-using-pf-in-os-x-lion-and-up\nIf you want pfctl to load at boot you'll need to roll your own launchd script.\nAnother option is a GUI app like Murus. You can then examine the launchd file it creates and the PF files in /etc/murus and understand better how to make this work for you.\n", "Q: baseconfig files?

Time Capsule does not refer to these files unless you specifically decide to reload an old config file into your Time Capsule. in most cases you would be better off configuring through Airport Utility and not bothering with keeping copies of those configurations unless you have a particular reason.\nOne possible reason for keeping config files could be a time-saving measure for frequently moving a Time Capsule from one network to another and back again so that you keep a copy of each configuration and reload that configuration when it has moved to new location. In most cases you would not have a particular need to keep config files.\n", "Q: iPhone is displaying weird time 9:41 My iPhone 5S with 9.1 is displaying 09:41 when it's actually 18:29 local time. \nIt doesn't seems to be a time channel problem 9:12 is a weird difference (I'm currently in GMT+1). \n\nA: EHHHH was connected to my Mac with the video stream launched in QuickTime (my iPhone was the input). \n9:41 is the \"famous\" time displayed during the keynotes :) \nQuitting the video stream solves the problem. \n", "Q: Microsoft Onenote iPhone app is not syncing Any tip for troubleshooting?

I first tried connecting it to a New PC Studio on a PC, but there was a problem after transfer 2 photos, so I tried again. But the PC could no longer detect the phone, even though the \"connected to computer\" icon appears on the phone. I tried a different cable, different USB ports. No use.\nSo I downloaded the Samsung Kies on my Mac. Same thing, it tries to search for the phone once I connect the phone, but the computer doesn't detect anything. The phone still shows the \"connected to computer\" icon.\nThere is also Bluetooth (no internet on the phone) on the phone, but it failed to send the picture each time I tried.\nWhat can I do at this point? Please also suggest data extraction software for either Mac or PC, if that's the easier route.\n\nA: Here is how I finally got the photos.\nI called various cell phone stores and asked for if they have a Cellebrite machine, a phone forensics machine that can get out contacts, pictures, and videos out. An AT&T store has it. So I went there. \nThe machine failed to connect to read from the phone twice, but it worked the 3rd time!! I got most of my pictures out. A read failure occurred twice during the transfer. Once I hit \"retry\" and it continued to work. The second time, it actually stopped. But I got the important photos out and I was so happy!\nI transferred the photos to my iPad. But You can transfer it to another phone. I tried transferring to my USB drive, but a read failure occurred as well around half way. After I checked the USB drive, it didn't have any pictures on it. So be careful if you choose that option.\nBtw, I don't know why the machine couldn't get my audio out. But those were not important.

I don't mind the overlapping idea, but the big difference is that the apps extend to the left now instead of to the right. Is there any way at all (without jailbreaking) to change the multitasking view in iOS 9 so that the open apps extend to the right instead of to the left? Thanks!\n\nA: No, not without jailbreaking.\nIf you're willing to jailbreak your phone, there is a tweak called SwitcherTweak (no idea how they came up with the name) which lets you select which direction the app switcher goes in.\n(Note: if you have updated to iOS 9.1, there's no jailbreak utility currently available for it and there is no way to downgrade.)\n", "Q: Controlling audio output's sample/bit rate on OSX from command prompt Is there a way to limit the output format of a soundcard on OSX, apart from Audio MIDI Setup? I have noticed that OSX has a bad habit of resampling audio while it is not needed at all (say the output from Spotify or Tidal). I would like to systematically prevent such a thing from happenning, while still having a choice on the output format. The solution can use shell or Apple script, so that I can run it with a shortcut.\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript that fixes the default audio format of the default output card before launching Spotify (tested on El Capitan only), but I prefer very much a solution that does not depend on GUI:\nset desiredRate to \"44100.0 Hz\"\nset desiredDepth to \"2ch-16bit Integer\"\n\ntell application \"Audio MIDI Setup\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Audio MIDI Setup\"\n        if not (window \"Audio Devices\" exists) then\n            click menu item \"Show Audio Devices\" of menu \"Window\" of menu bar item \"Window\" of menu bar 1\n        end if\n        tell group 1 of tab group 1 of group 1 of splitter group 1 of window \"Audio Devices\"\n            click button 1 of combo box 1\n            select (text field 1 of list 1 of scroll area 1 of combo box 1 whose value is desiredRate)\n            keystroke return\n            click pop up button 2\n            click menu item desiredDepth of menu 1 of pop up button 2\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"Audio MIDI Setup\" to quit\ntell application \"Spotify\" to activate\n\n", "Q: How much overhead (%) space requires migrating a iPhoto library to a Photo library? After migrating an iPhoto Library to a Photos App Library, they see actually share space by using hardlinks. So even the Finder says each folder use some amount of space, they are actually sharing it. That only applies if they are in the same volume. For example, both in the internal disk or both in the same partition of  the same external drive.\nHowever, migrating could share the actual pictures but each program has specific extra structure. It could be from thumbnails, index and other cached information.\nHow much extra space do I need, for example, for migrating and 150Gb iPhoto Library in an external drive?\nIt's important to know if the iPhoto library is in volume, let's say, with 170Gb. Will be the remaining 20Gb enough for the Photo App index?\nThe situation is particularly important for many Macbook air users as many of them, having small SSD disk, store their pictures in an external drive.\n\nA: No overhead at all.\nThe Photos library created by migrating uses \"hard links\" that point to the actual files. This causes it effectively just point to the exact same files as the iPhoto library contained.\nIn my case, my iPhoto library was 40 GB. So is my Photos library. But I only had 10 GB free space. After doing the migration, I still have 10 GB free space.\n(Note that you can then safely delete the iPhoto library afterwards, the file system is smart enough. See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/182799/172153.)\n\nA: If you migrate the Library from your existing iPhoto external drive to a new Photos library in that same location, you will actually not increase the real storage space used by much at all.\nWhat you will see - which might look disturbing, but isn't actually cause for concern - is that Get Info on a 200GB partition will show the file contents to be 270GB… more than the drive has space for!\nThis is because the Finder does not take the time to adjust for hard linked files & just takes the 'face value' of the reported size.\nThe real data size would be your original 135GB, plus perhaps a few needed for the new folder hierarchy & I would guess any thumbnail structures. Maybe several GB, but nowhere near the apparent 135GB that it will show in Get Info.\nAfter that, deleting either library will reduce the apparent size but not the real size. Only when both libraries are deleted will the entire 135GB be discarded.\n", "Q: Disable Apple Watch Screen Capture How can I disable or modify the screen capture feature of the Apple Watch?\nAlthough it may one day be a useful feature for me to take a screen capture of my watch, the hardware realities of the Apple Watch make this an extremely annoying implementation. It is all too easy to unknowingly and accidentally depress both the side button and digital crown at the same time. \nYes, I've tried wearing the watch higher up my wrist, and several different bands. I don't want to switch the watch's orientation because it would be at the cost of making the crown much less accessible. When I wear the watch while working out or doing physical work, I end up with a bunch of unwanted images propagating to all sorts of cloud backups, etc. I've taken to using the Screenshots album on my iPhone to mass delete, but they're already clogging my bandwidth and aforementioned storage.\n\nA: In watchOS 3, go to the Watch App -> General there is a toggle called Enable Screenshots that should be disabled by default (you have to scroll down a bit). When the switch is disabled, you can't take screenshot on the Watch.\n\nA: You cannot control this (on watchOS 2 and lower) with any setting or MDM profile. You could report feedback or a bug to Apple. Watch 3 is covered in this excellent answer.\nThe screen images are quite small - so yes in theory you have bandwidth being used - but it's going to be a hard case to make for Apple if you go on that as opposed to the time you lose cleaning up.\nI would experiment with the crown on the other side. I have the crown on the elbow side of the face since I don't like any button presses happening by accident. I also prefer using my thumb for the digital crown as opposed to an index finger and I really don't use the other button much if at all.\n", "Q: Get out of range error from monitor after rebooting from working monitor config I have a Mac Pro 3,1 w an nVidia 8800 GT running El Capitan.

They all seem to get this type of monitor 'memory loss' periodically.\n\nA: El Capitan - if you changed certain display attributes from the System prefs display pane, it saves the changes for the current account in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver..plist\nIf you have display problems with one account but not another, if the system boots to the login screen fine but the display goes crazy after name/password, you can either delete this file completely or edit out the offending sections.  Check a working account to see if you need the file.  You can probably copy a working file if you really need one.\nMy problem was setting refresh to 30Hz while trying out a cheap DP/HDMI adapter.  My monitor doesn't do 30Hz but the setting was saved so this account always threw the monitor into \"Out Of Range Error\".

HOW do I do this? \nI get this error every time I insert an sd card from my DSLR. It opened my sons external library, and when unplugged, I guess it is trying to connect to it. I know I could create a new library; but I don't want to use photos at all; but I get the message “Photos” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by OS X. when trying to delete the app. WTF? \n\nA: OS X will not let you remove Photos.app. And in their ever expanding quest to make things simpler and easier, certain preferences are hidden.\nSo open Photos and create a new photo library. there doesn't have to be anything in it, it just has to be there so Photos will open.\nInsert the card from your DSLR and photos will see the card and present you with a list of photos on the card.\nThere should be a checkbox (upper left if I recall correctly) that you can uncheck to prevent Photos from opening when you insert that card.\nAnd the fun continues! You can't turn it off for all cards all at once, you have to do it one at a time for each card you have with your camera.\nPerhaps a smart person can find a \"defaults write\" command to stop this from happening but so far this is the only way I have found to do it.\n", "Q: Shortcut key to open/apply profile in Terminal When in Terminal, I use Cmd-, to open the settings.

Is there a keyboard command to just open the profile so that I don't have to keep going to the mouse?\n\nA: To Create a new Window or Tab with a Specific Profile\nYou can assign keyboard shortcuts to the items in the Shell > New Window and New Tab submenus using System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts to add shortcuts to Terminal.\nFor example, if you add\n\nHomebrew ⌥⌘9\n\nto the preferences, typing ⌥-⌘-9 will open a new terminal window with the Homebrew profile.\nIf you want to assign keys for creating tabs, you'll need to explicitly refer to the New Tab submenu using “->”.

(Shouldn't it only have IPv6 when connecting to NAT64?)\nQ5: Do the com.apple.mis... conf files look ok? (having 192.168.1.11 as forward looks fine to me...)\n\nA: If I get your network configuration correctly, your setup is completely hosed.\nYou need two separate (physical) networks:\n\n\n*\n\n*one with IPv4 only (e.g. ethernet)\n\n*one with IPv6 only (e.g. local Wi-Fi)\n\n\nDepending of the capabilities of your machines, the machine with two interfaces (ethernet and Wi-Fi) should be the server (DNS/DHCP etc.)/NAT64-router (= macsrv).\nSince the iDevices don't have an ethernet interface and you try to test their IPv6/IPv4 functionality they should reside in the Wi-Fi section, which should be dedicated to IPv6 then. This local Wi-Fi network is not your Fritz!Box' Wi-Fi! You have to setup a personal hotspot on the NAT64 router!\nTo access a IPv4 server from your iDevices you may either use your normal router connection to the WAN or a dedicated IPv4 \"server\" (= macmedia) - both of them reside in the ethernet section \"behind\" the NAT64-router (= macsrv).\nIf macmedia doesn't have an ethernet interface just connect it to the Fritz!Box Wi-Fi, because technically the Fritz!Box Wi-Fi and the Fritz!Box ethernet are both in the ethernet section.\nTo access an IPv6 server use a web server on macsrv.\nSince you don't need IPv6 on your Fritz!Box router, simply turn it off.\n\nA: I'd suggest checking out if your /usr/libexec/unbound works properly with DNS queries coming via UDPv6. I encountered a similar issue and was able to solve it by recompiling unbound from source. I've reported the issue to Apple, so hopefully, it will get solved someday.\n", "Q: Login to OneDrive OS X with School/Company account Is there a way to login and access your OneDrive account with the OneDrive application from the Mac Store with your school/company account?

It has a 'scribble' mode, but then attempts to guess what you are drawing and changes it to match something it recognizes; but not what you want. I really, really wanted to like PDFPEN. I've used it for about 3 years because I just can't find anything else. But it is very frustrating. Versions I used did not auto-save. And I've had enough crashes with it that I've said many nasty words.. In the middle of writing, it loses its tracking with the tablet and draws strange lines. Writing too close to the edge causes issues. You are constantly changing the color back to what you want, if you annotate both with 'scribbles' and with text. The way it handles colors is maddening. I have Sierra and tried the latest V8.2.1 and it crashed so much I couldn't actually use it. \nI tried SKIM and it worked really well up to Sierra. Apparently Apple changed the PDF API (PDFkit) and it broke Skim so bad I think the developers are mad at Apple. \nSo I still haven't found a great one. Weird.. You'd think that would not be a hard thing to purchase.\ndave\n\nA: I have found OpenBoard to be a good, free alternative for marking up papers.  You can import a pdf, write on it, export it to pdf -- quick.  Of course, this software is designed for teachers and is free.  It is also less than perfect but has an active user community.  It makes my tablet much more useful, but has a bit of an efficiency learning curve.  It does hang, but autosaves and so I have never lost too much material.\n\nA: PDF Expert \nThis is the one that satisfied what I needed in a PDF application. Unfortunately, it is only available on Apple devices. Check out its features.\n", "Q: does the thunderbolt display have a cooling fan? My recently purchased 27\" Thunderbolt display is overheating.

I made the mistake of purchasing a MBP w/ only 128 GB of storage. When I ran out of space on the internal drive, I purchased a 512 GB external SSD, transferred all the data over to the SSD, and now run El Capitan on the external drive and use it as my main startup drive (in fact, the internal drive is completely formatted). \nHow do I partition the external SSD into two drives, one that runs OS X and the other with Windows 10? The reason I don't want to set up windows on the internal drive is because I want 256 GB dedicated to windows, leaving the other 256 GB on the external drive for OS X. \nBoot Camp Assistant seems to only detect the internal drive, so I don't know how to properly partition the drive and install windows 10 on it. I've tried partitioning with Disk Utility as well, but when running Boot Camp again, it only allows me to partition the internal drive. Maybe there is a way to install Windows on the internal drive, and then transfer it over to a 256 GB partition on the external drive?\nI'm very new to/unfamiliar with this kind of stuff, so I'm sorry if this is a poor question.\nThanks for your help\n\nA: As Apple states here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201456\n\nCan I install Windows on an external drive?\nNo, Boot Camp requires that Windows be installed on your internal hard disk.\n\n\nThere's a workaround, which doesn't use Bootcamp.

It's perfectly safe and you won't lose any data, I restart my iDevices all the time.\nIt that doesn't work, report the bug to Apple and hope the public release of iOS 9.2 fixes your camera. You could update to the beta of iOS 9.2 if you're desperate for the camera to work, but the beta would also cause new, bigger problems.\n\nA: There could be countless issues, but I'd like to mention two.\nFacetime's problems may be caused due to the fact that it uses the client-server model, which is a considerably slower communication method than operating on peer-to-peer. This peer-to-peer protocol used by Skype is what makes connections more responsive, and that effectively means less bugs during video calls.\nAnother possibility is a bug in the app itself. The countless times I have had to do a hard reset is beyond exhaustive, but you could try and see if it helps in any way.\nA hard reset is done by pressing and holding down the power and home buttons until the Apple logo appears. I wouldn't be surprised if it still doesn't work though, the app is the most faulty one I have yet used.\n", "Q: Permanently Disabling System Integrity Protection I have disabled system integrity protection on El Cap following this Ask Different question but it keeps coming back every time I reboot which is annoying.   \nIs there an extra step I need to perform to stop SIP switching itself back on after reboot?\n\nA: There should be no extra step required - in fact, reading through the excellent article linked from that question, I found this…\n\nBecause SIP’s configuration is stored in NVRAM, SIP’s protection settings will apply to the entire machine and will persist even if the OS is reinstalled.\n\nThis would perhaps imply your NVRAM is not correctly holding data -\nperhaps try a reset,  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   P   R  at the chimes & keep holding until you hear the chimes a second time.\nSource : System Integrity Protection – Adding another layer to Apple’s security model\nIf after resetting NVRAM one time, you can’t make SIP status stick the next steps are to repair and wipe your drive and then seek hardware service is a freshly erased and reinstalled OS won’t allow you to disable SIP. \n", "Q: Can we disable the drag window to top of screen Mission Control / Spaces feature in El Capitan? \nOpen Mission Control\nUse any of these methods to open Mission Control:\n....\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In OS X El Capitan, drag a window to the top of the screen.\n  \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100\nI'm using a window snapping/resizing app and this feature above, introduced in El Capitan, is being triggered instead.

If it is slow you have either a hardware or software issue. I could never recommend replacing any Intel i# equipped computer unless it was for a better video card or needing an insane amount of RAM. If it is taking that long to boot after a fresh install my first guess would be hard drive issues. Have you tried using Disk Utility to see if it comes up with anything?

Why?\nFor example, unzipping this zip file will result in the LICENSE, README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md (plaintext files) to be marked as executable. But unzipping this .tar.gz file does not exhibit this behavior.\nWhen unzipping each using the command line unzip utility, OSX does not mark the files as executable. So why is the Finder doing this? It seems strange, and insecure, for it to be marking plaintext files as executable.\n\nA: The ZIP format does not contain information about Unix permissions (see ZIP, file headers). By default all files are then marked as executable.\nTar can store this information and by untarring it is possible to restore them (see tar, file format).\n", "Q: User account unresponsive I have an account that's unresponsive. When I login with this non-admin user, everything hangs. Even Dock won't show up. Just the spinning beach ball.\nBack-story: \n\n\n*\n\n*This is occurs every couple of weeks. I reinstall OS X ontop and everything back to normal for a while. I even blew away and reformatted entire HD, followed by installation of very few applications (Office  2016, BackBlaze, HandyPrint, NPM, Node, and a few other developer tools). All software is legit and purchased through official channels. \n\n*I am on El Capitan 10.11.1 at this point (this problem persisted throughout upgrades from Yosemite)\n\n*There are no hardware issues found by AHT utility test. No bad sectors on HD. \n\n*I just blew away everything in users's Library/Launch* (there were only two items (com.office...plist and com.google...plist)\n\n*I blew away user Preferences\n\n*Admin account works fine.\n\n*I have gone though this cycle about 5 times so far - works for 3 weeks, then problem comes back. I find nothing interesting in Console log, top, or opensnoop. \nHow do I diagnose this problem? I have a working admin account that I can use to look at all the files from the affected user, and make any modifications necessary for debugging purposes.  \n\nA: I ended up burning that user. \nThere was definitely something something in ~/Library that caused this. I fiddled a bit with deleting more stuff out of ~/Library but didn't narrow down exactly to which setting/app caused it. Finally when ~/Library was half empty, the user started to work. I moved ~/Documents, Downloads, Desktop over to a new account, burned the afflicted and renamed new user back to old name. At least now I know where to start digging next time it occurs.\n", "Q: Will Apple reject my iOS app if it has unused UIViewControllers? Will apple reject my iOS app if it has unused UIViewControllers?\nI have many UIViewControllers in the Storyboard. However there are few of them I am leaving for next releases as they need more testing. Their functionality is implemented though. \nCan I submit the app with these conditions?\nThe unused UIViewControllers are isolated from the used ones, So there are no segues between unused UIVC and a used one.\n\nA: The app won't get rejected.\nApple don't browse the source of your app—they're testing the functionality from a user's point of view. Private API detection is left to iTunes Connect.\nYou should still try to remove unused code from your app to make the app as small as possible for users.\n", "Q: Move HDD from a MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) model to another MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) model I have a HDD from MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) model: OS: Yosemite; The content in the HDD is important to me.\nI want to know If I can buy a MacBook Pro of the same model, Mid 2012, and simply hook the HDD in and get it running as it was in the original Mac. \nI don't want to use the Disk Utility or a cloning tool to copy the content.\n\nA: As long as you're certain the replacement hardware is identical to your original, then yes this will work. One important caveat:\nThis is something I would not do without testing first. I'd invest in either a USB-SATA drive adapter or a cheap USB enclosure and use that to connect your old laptop's drive to the replacement laptop and see if it comes up as a bootable drive by holding down the option key at startup. If it shows up in the boot manager and successfully boots the system that way then it should be ok to swap it in. \nIf you're unsure of how to verify if your replacement is the same build as your old laptop I'd recommend using this site: [http://www.chipmunk.nl/klantenservice/applemodel.html/] to do a comparison using the serial numbers of both systems.\n\nA: If you buy the same model Macbook, then the old hard drive should work perfectly. If it is a different model, things can get tricky. The hard drive has startup files that assume the presence of certain hardware. \nOne thing that is easy to do, is to use the hard drive in target disk mode before you swap the hard drive. This allows you to mount the hard drive externally, but boot the Mac from it. If the new Mac starts with the old hard drive, then you can safely swap it. If not, then you can return the Macbook.\n-Purchase a USB to SATA adapter (example)\n-Attach the hard drive to the adapter, and then plug into USB\n-Reboot the computer, and hold down the \"T\" key. A menu will show your external drive. Select it.\nOf course, reusing the hard drive also means that you now have a used, three year old drive in your Mac. The data on the old drive is not tied to that drive, and its fairly simple to transfer it. Another option is to purchase an external case for the hard drive, in which case you simply attach the drive whenever you need the data.\n\nA: If you buy the same model, there is no reason ;)\nHere you have a simple tutorial from iFixit to change your hard disk :\nhttps://fr.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+Hard+Drive+Replacement/10761\nNormally you can put every 2.5\" HDD.. It's exactly the same if the HDD is already full or not.\n\nA: You most certainly can, as long as it is the same model of MacBook (July 2012). I have a mid-2012 MBP myself and have removed and replaced HDD several times, although I would not recommend the method you are choosing. If you are set on a mid-2012 MBP I suggest you at least transfer the files from your HDD to an SSD and put the SSD in your new MBP, otherwise you would have a 3-year-old hard drive in your (relatively) new laptop.\n\nA: You could put the old HDD in the new machine. \nBuy a HDD caddy off ebay (or aliexpress or so) and replace the DVD-ROM with it. \nNice solution for extra storage. And if you ned the option for an optical drive, buy an external DVD-ROM. \n\nA: Generally: if the hardware fits, you can swap it.  \nInstallations of MacOS are usually device-independent. You could put the hard drive from your Mac into an external drive caddy and boot up from it on most Macs. (As long as the Mac model isn't too old to run the OS.)\nThe exceptions are when a new model is released with a unique OS build version containing drivers to support its new hardware: these drivers usually get rolled into the standard OS on the next release.\nNew Macs with T2 chips may not work for different reasons. Firstly, the internal storage cannot be swapped out, and you can't boot to externals without explicitly setting NVRAM to allow it. \nI cloned my 2012 Mini onto my new 2018 Mini, and the OS wouldn't start until I had reinstalled the OS using Recovery. But after that, the OS worked and I retained all my data.\n\nA: It Should be possible I have experience in this and have transplanted a HDD from a MacBookPro8,1 to a mid-2012 iMac (sorry forgot model code) and after repairing permissions it worked fine, this was using OS X 10.9.\n", "Q: Duplicate photo libraries I have a question about duplicate photo libraries that seems the opposite of a previously asked question. In my case, after converting iPhoto library to Photos library, the computer at one point asked if I wanted to convert Photos library to iPhoto library. So I said yes and now have two libraries. \nIn this case I think each one is taking up 130 GB of space rather than each library pointing to the same photos, and I would like to remove one of them. Is it safe to remove the iPhoto library? Would this also delete the photos used by the Photos library?\n\nA: If you make a time machine backup, you can be sure that you can recover from anyone's guess as to whether you have two libraries or just that the files are linked together. \nPhotos is designed to use hard links in some cases to avoid duplicating every photo during the transition period. When you eventually delete the old library, then you no longer have linked files. Keep in mind - when files are hard linked, you have two pointers to the same one file. No duplication happens other than at the level you are accustomed to seeing things in Finder and open/save dialogs. \n", "Q: finder menu \"Services>>New Terminal at Folder\" doesn't work It opens a terminal at the user directory, just like clicking on the terminal icon does. I'm popping up a menu in Finder, on the folder, and the folder is outlined to indicate it is the subject of the menu, but the terminal doesn't open on that folder.\nRunning Yosemite 10.10.5. In Preferences>>Keyboard>>Shortcuts>>Services \"New Terminal at Folder\" is checked.\nAny clues/pointers how to fix this?\n(I just discovered this \"New Terminal at Folder\" feature, so I don't know if it was ever working or when it stopped working.)\n\nA: I tried it and it does work but on directories (folders) only. I know that you said you selected a folder and it refuses to work but I don't have enough knowledge to understand the files in the System responsible for the correct activity.\nI might recommend turning the option off and back on again. Create a new folder and immediately right click.\n\n\nTo those of you who said you are still not able to achieve the goal of adding the final step, a keyboard shortcut, this second screenshot should do it.\n", "Q: Keynote 6.6: How can I make an object wider by animation, but not higher I want to animate a block to be wider, but not higher. \nfrom this:\n____________________\n|    Some Text      |\n---------------------\n\nto this:\n______________________________________\n|             Some Text               |\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe scale animation seems to work only with locked ratio and can't figure out how to do it. \n\nA: One way to accomplish this is with the Magic Move animation.  However this will require an additional slide.  Duplicating the slides including their content will not give the appearance of a slide change, only items that are moved or changed will appear to animate, not the slide itself.  See animation below.\n\n*\n\n*Create your object on one slide.\n\n*Duplicate the slide.\n\n*Resize the object in the second slide to the desired width.\n\n*Set animation on the first slide to Magic Move\n\n*Change the animation duration and/or acceleration to the desired result.\n\nSlide one:\n\nSlide two:\n\nResulting animation:\n\n", "Q: Trying to install Windows 10 on early 2008 MBP without using the BootCamp Assistant I have an early 2008 MBP, where I installed El Capitan. However I would like to split my HD and install Win10 as well. Since there is no direct support, it is quite difficult. \nI find this question \"How do I get Windows 10 installed on my macbook pro (late 2008)\" here with a logical answer which was \"How to install Windows without using the BootCamp Assistant.\" \nMy issue is when I want to bless my HD in Terminal, I get the following error message \"Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc\" and thus the rest of the instructions do not work.\nAny suggestions, recommendations, idea how to solve it? \nI already made a brand new OSX install, but the error is still the same. \nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Just a thought, but can you install Win 7 using the bootcamp that is designed for your system and then once installed upgrade to Win 10?\nNote that the Windows 10 bootcamp drivers will not likely support your hardware but I have had some moderate success updating bootcamp drivers on Windows installations from within Windows by identifying any unsupported hardware by their hardware ID (in device manager) and then downloading the driver directly from the manufacturer.\n", "Q: Keep WLAN deactivated on El Capitan I've updated from Yosemite to 10.11.1 on my mid 2014 macbook pro a few days ago. I've got a WLAN in my apartment (for other gadgets), but since the signal is a bit weak at my desk, I have connected the macbook to the router using a LAN cable and a thunderbolt-ethernet adapter and switched WLAN off on the macbook. All was well on Yosemite, but El Capitan insists on switching on WLAN during most boots. Is there any way to prevent this without removing admin rights from my user and without removing the WLAN network from the list of known networks?\nI'm concerned about the potential security issues (in case it might connect to open networks when I'm traveling). It's also a nuisance because WLAN seems to take priority over the ethernet connection, which means I have a slow and unstable connection until I remember to switch WLAN off again.\nI guess I could create a new user without admin rights. Since I made sure that admin rights are necessary to activate WLAN that should prevent the issue, but I would prefer to avoid this \"solution\".\n\nA: Your question touches upon a few different areas so I will aim to address these individually:\n\nDisabling a network service\nYou did not mention how you were disabling the Wi-Fi (i.e. WLAN) service, however there are generally two ways to do so from System Preferences in OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then Network\n\n*Click Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the left\n\n*Click Turn Wi-Fi off, then close the System Preferences window\n\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then Network\n\n*Click Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the left\n\n*Click the gear icon (⚙), then Make service inactive, then click Apply\nBoth methods should persist through a reboot or shutdown. Neither method requires removing any known networks, as you were concerned about, and both should result in the service being disabled until turned on again using the same method.\nIt is important to note that if you click Turn Wi-Fi off in the method above, it is necessary to close the System Preferences window. If you reboot or shutdown without doing so, the option will not persist. Similarly, if you disable Wi-Fi from the menu bar icon (top-right of screen) the setting will not survive a reboot or shutdown.\nIf, as you mention, the service is activated again after following one of the methods above, I would suggest removing the service completely (by selecting it from the service list and clicking the delete or — icon) then recreating it using the same settings, perhaps under a different name (e.g. WLAN Test).\nNote: You can always Revert any changes you make before Applying them in Network preferences. Be careful not to lose any details that you otherwise don't have written down.\n\nProtecting against open networks\nAs you suggested, it's wise to be concerned about the potential risks associated with open Wi-Fi networks, and you can at least opt out of joining these automatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then Network\n\n*Click Wi-Fi or the custom-named service from the service list on the left\n\n*Enable the Ask to join networks checkbox:\n\n\n\nAs described, known networks will be joined automatically. If no known networks are available a selection dialog will appear on-screen, giving you the option to join any available, but unknown, Wi-Fi network.\nFor additional protection you can require the administrator password when changing networks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Advanced... then enable the Change networks checkbox under the heading Require administrator authorization to:\n\nAdjusting network service order\nIt's generally advisable to prioritise your network services by their reliability, from most to least reliable, to give you the best experience when using multiple connections. In your case — since WLAN traffic appears to be taking priority over other traffic — this means giving the wired thunderbolt-to-ethernet service priority over your WLAN :\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple menu (), then System Preferences, then Network\n\n*Click the gear icon (⚙), and select Set Service Order... as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In the panel that appears arrange the services by dragging them to the desired order, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click OK, then Apply\nThe system will attempt to utilise services in the order that you specified above. If a service is not available (e.g. cable disconnected, no network available) it will fall back to the next service, if any, until a valid service is found, or alternatively all services fail.\n", "Q: How do I send a calendar event from the iphone calendar via an email or imessage? I want to forward a specific calendar event from the iOS Calendar App to an email address or iMessage address or text message using my iPhone. I don't want to use the cloud or sync anything. I am using iOS 8.4 but would also be interested in how to do this in iOS 9.\n\nA: The simplest method would be to use a contact in your address-book and add them as an invitee to the calendar event.\nYou will be prompted to send an invite to them.\nEDIT: Previous link sucked.\nHere are the steps circa iOS 9:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Calendar app on your iPhone or iPad\n\n*Either create a new event or tap an existing event that you'd like to share\n\n*Tap on the Edit button in the upper right hand corner\n\n*Tap Invitees.

Therefor I presume you mean forward an event you have received.\nTo forward the particulars of an event you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the Event\n\n*Tap on the Invitees\n\n*Tap the small envelope icon in the upper right (creates an email)\n\n*Delete the invitee list in the \"To\" field of the email\n\n*Type the email address of the person to whom you wish to forward the info\n\n*Tap \"Send\" in the upper right.\n\n\nIt is not truly forwarding the event but it does contain the event details. \nInsane that Apple neglected this very common and needed feature in an otherwise rather decent product.

Just over six days ago, I sent a friend on Facebook a couple messages.\nOn the conversation view of Facebook Messenger for iPhone, I can see that they've received my messages because next to each message, there's a solid-blue circle with a white checkmark inside.\nFor several days after I sent the messages, I could see (under their name at the top) their active/online status, e.g., \"Active 1d ago,\" but now, I just see, \"Messenger.\"\nI've waited long enough—I know it takes a little while—and \"Messenger\" hasn't changed to show their active status.

I've just installed windows 10 x64 on my mac, a partition that I made with Disk Utility. I was going to use BootCamp however the way BootCamp formatted the partition in El Capitan didn't allow Windows to be installed (I believe it was because of not formatting it correctly).\nSo now I've got it all installed however the drivers aren't (headphones and Wifi don't work; plus I'm not sure it's using my graphics card either). \nHow do I go about installing the drivers I need for this version of Windows?\n\nA: Remove the partition and installation you made and go back to the BootCamp way. Then, inside the Windows installer, format the partition BootCamp makes for you, that is an extra step that is needed. Then, you can install Windows 10. I'd suggest using a USB stick to prepare the Windows 10 installation so that Drivers are included automatically.\nIf you do not want to follow this strategy, there is an option to download the BootCamp drivers separately, either from Apple's site, or from within the BootCamp utility on OSX, from one of the top menu's or the default assistant screen. The menu is called Action and has only one option: Download Windows Support Software. Once you have it downloaded, copy it over to a FAT32 USB stick so Windows can read it and your Mac can write it. exFAT might possibly work too. Reboot in to Windows and then open the bootcamp setup program form the directory you just downloaded and follow the on-screen steps.\n", "Q: VMWare Tools do not allow changing resolution in El Capitan Looks like VMWare Tools do not allow changing resolution in El Capitan.

Good luck!\n(As for the commenter talking about the Apple licence agreement, I'm not a lawyer but I understand it's not a violation if you're running on Apple hardware. In my case I'm running this on my MacBook Pro, and I'm happy to report that macOS guests worked out of the box for me.)\n", "Q: Remotely upgrading to El Capitan broke Screen Sharing We have a remote Mac Mini acting as a build server that we use Screen Sharing to connect to and remotely manage.\nWell I recently upgraded this box to El Capitan and now Screen Sharing won't connect to it at all.\nI've upgraded the OS remotely before and never ran into a problem. Is there any way to connect to this box and get screen sharing working or am I S.O.L.? I can ping it, but I can't seem to do anything else (file sharing, ssh, screen sharing).\nUpdate: I did a port scan on the server and it can't find any open ports. I guess that pretty much settles it then. I still don't understand how upgrading and rebooting the box could have so completely bricked it. I mean did Apple really not remote upgrading a possibility?\nI'm half picturing some \"Welcome to El Capitan, just a few screens to click through before you get your computer back\" dialog to be sitting on the screen right now. \nUpdate 2: So we got this resolved, but it looks as though something may have gone wrong during the upgrade process as our IT guy says it wasn't responsive when he plugged a monitor into it. He had to reboot the machine before it would respond. Anyway just wanted to give a heads up to others.\n\nA: The three ways to connect are Apple Remote Desktop, ssh and remote Apple Events. If you have one of those enabled, you can kickstart screen sharing with a command line tool:\n   sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -restart -agent -privs -all\n\nSee these for more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server\n\n*Remotely turn on screen sharing\n\n*activating screen sharing remotely\nIf not, you will have to have the machine shipped to a human or a human shipped to the machine to take local corrective action and diagnose the failure. \n\nA: eAfter a local update to El Capitan, I could also not get the Screen Sharing (VNC://) to work.

I also tried using RUFUS to create a bootable Windows USB disk but it is not detected neither. Any solution or alternative?\n\nA: Solved it! I created the bootable USB with Rufus, just select the Windows ISO and format the disk as FAT32. The partition scheme must be MBR Partition Scheme for UEFI if you select compatibility for both BIOS and UEFI-CSM it won't be detected on startup.\n", "Q: Internal vs. External Storage for a new Macbook I want to get a new MacBook Pro, and am confused by the storage options. The Apple website offers 2 different options for storage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preinstalled internal flash storage (256, 512, or 1 TB)\n\n*Thunderbolt enabled external storage\n\n\nI assume that the preinstalled flash storage is better, but it comes at a stiff premium ($450). Is there still reason to favor it over the other options?\nSpecifically, can I use the external storage like the internal storage easily, or will I run into bugs, errors, and other difficulties? I will be using music and pictures from the external drive on programs (iTunes, iPhoto, importing, editing, and exporting.) Will I be able to do that with the external storage, or should I go with the internal storage option?\nI am looking for the simplest solution, not the most elegant code ; )\n\nA: It all comes down to your convenience.\nThe MacBook Pro (MBP) uses a proprietary interface for their SSD; PCIe 2.0 x4.  This is why they are so expensive as you have noticed.\nUpgrading the SSD in the MBP to a larger SSD, whether you get it at time of purchase or you get it later on, is going to be an expensive proposition and the only reason that you do this is because you want as many of your files with you at all times without having to connect a portable drive.  That's the convenience factor.\nHowever, if not having all your files readily available on your MBP and toting around an external drive is not a problem, then going with a smaller SSD and an external drive is definitely a good choice.\nAs for what you want to do, there is no problem with keeping your files like photos, movies, music, etc. on an external drive.  As for performance, you probably won't notice much of a performance hit depending on exactly what you are doing.\nOne caveat... You will need at least 2 external drives.\nWhy?\nYou are going to back up your stuff, right?  If you are going to be toting around another drive, there is a greater possibility of data loss; physical damage, stolen, or just leaving it on a table somewhere in a coffee shop.  You are going to want this backed up.  A USB 3.0 drive with sufficient space should be more than adequate to do a Time Machine backup during the night (where performance isn't going to hamper anything).\nTo know how big of a backup drive to get, just make sure it is larger than the total of your internal SSD and external drive.  If you have a 128GB SSD and a 1TB external, get at least 1.5TB.  If you are closer to 2TB of internal and external combined, get a 4TB.  If more than that, you probably want to look at some pro level solutions.\nUltimately, the choice is up to you whether you want the convenient method of having all storage internal to the MBP or you don't mind having to plug in an external drive.\n\nA: Well, besides if it is a comfortable solution, your intentions are possible.\nHaving a MacBook Pro with an SSD (because it is fast, consumes less power than a HDD drive) with the OS and applications, you can use the external HDD via (USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt) to store the application data, like ITunes Music. If you don't have it plugged in, e.g. while your are on a trip, you can't just simply access it.\nI myself have an 512 GB SSD with a 128 GB SD JetDrive Lite (http://www.transcend-info.com/apple/jetdrivelite/). It is always plugged in, so always usuable. The 128 GB is used for music, pictures, books and documents of all kinds. Most of my work is stored there. Still easy to replace. I rather doubt than the SD card or SSD will worn out within the next 2 years.\nFor both solutions I have experienced no side effects or bugs so far.\n\nA: I also chose a minidrive to upgrade my storage. \nBut i bought mine on TheMiniDrive and it works great.\nI think is the simplest solution and if you need more than 128GB they can provide the device. Ask through email.\nMine is 256GB \n", "Q: Upgraded iMac 5k restarts randomly I have a very frustrating problem and I need your guys help to fix it.\nI bought an imac 5k that I upgraded it's CPU, HDD, RAM.\nThis is my second one i have upgraded and the second one that keeps restarting randomly, sometimes once a few days, other times once a week or less.\nI have put in an I7, EVO SSD and Apple Ram.\nI have tried testing it with less and more ram and it still restarts our of the blue. \nThe only connection between the two imac upgrades is the Thermalpad Arctic( 1,5mm which has a 6 W/mk thermal conductivity, its the best I could find ) I have used to cool the GPU. \nI am running multiple flash related software/streamers that are very heavy on the CPU and GPU, and some photoshoping. \nIt always does restart when in use, but that's because when I am on it/ rather say, my wife is on it, she uses it for work but i don't think it restarts during normal use.\nThe fans are loud but i did not notice any pattern in which when it does restart, the fans are louder than before. They stay pretty much over 2000 rpm, which is a huge difference than the I5 i had before, doing the same kind of work, but I read that this is normal considering the I7 is much hotter. Thermal paste used was Arctic Silver 5.\nWhat makes it difficult is that it is very hard to monitor the iMac because I am not working on it and sitting there and waiting for the restart to happen is just nuts. I was thinking I could observe the temps but I am sure that is not a feasible way to see if temps are to blame.\nI went to library>logs>but couldn't find any readable log about this kernel panic.\nIs there a software that logs the temperatures so after it restarts I can compare them to see if heat is to blame?\nI have gone through different set of rams, external USBs, OS versions, you name it, nothing seems to solve it. \nHow to go on and investigate this issue?\nThank you very much!\nDan\nLE:\nI managed to make it restart. I had the usual amount of work that i topped with 4 4k videos playing at the same time on youtube. Here is a remaining pictures from team viewer at the moment of the restart.\nDo you think that's enough ? I read that the values can go over 100 C without any problems. \nI am using iStats first one is CPU, GPU-Die, Ram, CPU Fan Rpm\n\n\nA: Problem solved. I believe the 1.5mm thermal pads were too thick on the GPU rams and the cooler didn't make enough contacts on the GPU chip. I went to an Apple service provider and asked them nicely if they could sell me the thermal paste they use and they were very kind and gave me a bunch of 2CL syringes with paste manufactured by Shin Etsu Microsi - microsi.com, that is what they use on apple products and it did the job.\nI put a small pea shape bit of paste in the middle of the GPU memory chips, they are 8 and I used 1CL for every chip and when you put the cooler ontop it spreads it evenly. You could use less and it won't leak when you push the cooler in but i wanted to be safe and fill the gap between the cooler and the GPU chips.\nBe careful, this paste is thick, its a pain to spread it evenly. You have to get a credit card and put paste on the top edge and swipe it with a bit of force so you can apply it in one take because its a mess to spread it with your finger, its like it won't stick to the chip.\nI now have 56 Degrees on the CPU and 55 degrees C on the GPU die, lightly used and never went over 75 degrees C no matter the stress of the system. Measured with iStat Pro.\nI hope it will help someone even though nobody cared to give me a hand.\nPeace!\n", "Q: why are my iPhone4 videos different in size?

If not, it's possible, you may need to Tell SystemEvents to open application \"ITunes\" (or whatever the syntax is) -- or you could always use the do shellscript command to open the application, in which case the actual shell command would be open /Applications/iTunes.app/ -- which you can verify in Terminal.\nThe error could also be if the iTunes app needs GUI focus for these operations to take place and the application automatically loses focus while the script is being run when another application is opened or the user clicks away or some scenario of that sort, which your script will need to be able to account for.  In cases such as this, you may want to tell SystemEvents to activate application \"iTunes\" before any important actions take place.  This will cause the iTunes window to regain focus.\nIt may actually be this same SystemEvents command (you probably need to check/correct my syntax) that initially opens the application if it is not already open at the time the script is run.\n", "Q: Enable Terminal / iterm2 sound notification exclusively Is there a way to enable the bell terminal and other sound notification from the terminal, while my \"play user interface sound effect\" setting is off ?\nI don't like to have any sound notification (I prefer the flashing screen), but I'm using weechat and I wish I could enable some sound notification in it.\n\nA: You can create separate profiles one with sound disabled (default) and one with sound enabled (for your weechat).

In the last few hours it has been hot, and has not cooled down. There are about 2 apps running on my phone: Settings and Safari.\n\nA: The battery in your phone is dying. Continuing to use it and charge it could cause it to catch on fire.

Chrome, Opera and IE8 dont want to play it...:( And show me the black screen only.\nIs that normal or I do something wrong? I need it to play in IE and Chrome for most of our employees...\n\nA: Export to QuickTime / Movie\nYour best option is to export the presentation as a QuickTime movie. This will create an MPEG4 formatted file that can be played on a wide range of devices and operating systems:\nKeynote.app > File (menu) > Export To… > QuickTime\n\nCompress with Handbrake\nAfter exporting your presentation, consider compressing the resulting movie file using Handbrake. Handbrake will dramatically reduce the file size and broaden the number of supported playback devices.\nView with Browser or VLC\nMany web browsers across different operating systems can also natively play back MPEG4 files; so for many employees a web browser such as UE or Chrome will be enough to view the presentation.\nAlternatively Mac, Windows, and Linux users can all play exported movies using the free application VLC.\n\nA: EDIT: As of Chrome 53.0.2785.116 this bug has been fixed, and Keynote presentations exported as HTML now work properly (see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=528681)\nOld answer:\nSince the release of Chrome 45, Keynote presentations exported as an html file are broken.

Please note, however, that it is only supported by modern browsers.  See note below.\nOtherwise, as Graham Miln states in his answer, a movie would be a better choice.

OS X uses Python, so just because you may not need the module, that doesn't mean that OS X doesn't. Really, this is why they created SIP in the first place.\n", "Q: OpenVPN JSON error after upgrading to El Capitan After upgrading to El Captian, OpenVPN displays the following error when attempting a connection: \"JSONDialog: Error running jsondialog\".\nI'm using OpenVPN version 2.0.9.201.\nHow do I get OpenVPN to work without disabling SIP?\n\nA: Short answer, you can't.\nHowever, at work we had this issue.  Some machines that previously had OpenVPN installed prior to upgrading to El Capitan had no problem.  \nOthers required that we run the uninstall script for OpenVPN.  Then disable SIP, install OpenVPN, then re-enable SIP when you are done.  Annoying, and a bit time consuming, but the end result is that you have OpenVPN installed and SIP is enabled.\nThis has worked on multiple Mac's at our office.\nThe other alternative was to use Viscosity which does not require SIP to be disabled, but has a small licensing fee.  I have heard that Tunnelblick also works, but have not personally tried it.\n\nA: Without the trick from bayendor to disable SIP, install openvpn, reenable SIP, you can also use Tunnelblick.\nIt does work even with System Integrity Protection enabled.\n", "Q: Recuva for OS X? I'm looking for a file recovery utility for OS X, like Recuva for Windows. (Assuming Time Machine wasn't configured) Is there anything similar?\n\nA: I have used a product called Disk Drill\nI personally successfully made good use of this product about a month ago when a simple mistake caused me to erase a drive I had no intention of erasing.  Basically, I added the drive I used to back up all my files as part of my CoreStorage for a DIY fusion drive.  So, I didn't just delete the files, I deleted the entire portion.\nWhile I had most things backed up, I had several files that only existed on that drive.  I was able to recover every one of them.\n", "Q: Can I use a PlayStation 3 or 4 controller with a 4th gen AppleTV? Does anyone have experience pairing and using an official Sony PlayStation 3 or 4 controller with the 4th gen Apple TV?\n\nA: You can only use Made For iPhone (MFi) controllers with the Apple TV at the moment.\n\nA: It is my understanding that for the iPhone, a PS 4 controller can be used on a jail-broken phone using an app called Controllers for All. I'm not aware of any other methods.\nUnder the assumption that the Apple TV is mostly an iOS device, and if a jailbreak for the new Apple TV is possible, then I'd expect the developer of Controllers for All to try to release a version for the Apple TV.\nThat said, I haven't seen any word from the developer (Ori Kadosh, @cjori) that he plans for an Apple TV release.\n\nA: No, but you can buy a SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Gaming Controller for around $50 for the Apple TV (4th generation).\n", "Q: POP account issues with El Capitan Why is my POP account not working after I upgraded to El Capitan? I sometimes can get mail and then it stops working so the problem is intermittent.\n\nA: Think I may have found a solution. Went to mail preferences - then accounts - then advanced - then UNCHECKED \"automatically detect and maintain account settings\"... my mail seems to be coming in without disruption...\n\nA: When I contacted GoDaddy thinking it was their shenanigans that caused the POP to stop, he advised me that El Cap was at fault. He wanted to \"fix\" it by charging me an additional $97/yr. I said no and after whining a little, he gave me the same instructions posted here. However, he did tell me this fix was only temporary.\n", "Q: Is it safe to listen to Apple earpods at 75% volume? The sensitivity is listed at 109 DB, so I guess 75% volume is about 82 DB, which is pretty safe.\n\nA: While this is a little bit off topic, I'll provide some thoughts here.\n\n\n*\n\n*you can't expect the percentage scaling directly with dB SPL. While both are surely nonlinear inside the affected electronics, the nonlinearity of Apple's percentage may not be logarithmic but dB SPL are. \n\n*sensitivity is dB SPL at 1 V. This usually has not much to do with the sound pressure level, your headset produces at 100%. \n\n*audio files and sounds from apps and programs may be scaled differently. Computer equipment and phones usually do not provide a compressor algorithm, so a setting of 75% yields totally different sound pressure levels for different sound sources. \nConclusion: No, it is not necessary safe to listen at 75%. It may or may be not healthy. \n", "Q: How to change Time Machine settings of a partly broken OS (e.g. by manipulating configuration files) I have a broken Mac OS 10.6.8 here. \n\n\n*\n\n*Startup is normal, login works, but most programs can't be started\n\n*Repair of OS with install disks fails\n\n*Backup via Time Machine is working\n\n*System Settings cannot be accessed\n\n\nSo I have a working backup and want to erase the harddisk to make an installation of 10.7 possible. The problem is, that the backup does not incorporate all files and folders I need. This is due to the settings excluding some folders. Is there a way to change the excluded folders manually?\nI'm fine with a hint where to find the configuration files for Time Machine, so I can change them with an appropriate Editor.\n\nA: The folders or paths excluded from the Time Machine backup are stored in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\nTo include them again modify the file with an editor (TextEditor will not work) or sudo nano /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist and remove all entries in the SkipPaths array. In the example below you'd have to remove line 19 to include the (excluded) /Applications folder again.\n\nYou then probably have to restart the backup daemon.\nIf you don't have access to Terminal or an appropriate editor, copy the files and folders manually with the Finder to the backup volume and copy them back after installing the new operating system.\n", "Q: Auto Airprinting I'm mostly a windows/android user, but I have a new device that works best with airprinting, so please bear with me. \nI'm looking to do some 'auto-airprinting'. Basically, what I ultimately what to do is watch a specific folder on a device (whether it be a ipad, or mac) and all new documents in the folder I want to airprint them. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\nIs there a script or a automation program or...yea. Anything.\n\nA: You could try the iOS application called Workflow. It has a lot of automation abilities including AirPrint.\n", "Q: Reading creation date from file an change I have files named \"clip-2016-03-01 10;01;14.mp4\" and would like to make filename to creation date of file.\nFound this thread\nread creation date from file name and change - batch\nfor f in *; do\nt=$(echo $f | sed -E 's/([A-z]*-)|([ ,;])|(\\..*)//g' | sed -E 's/(.*)(..)/\\1.\\2/')\ntouch -t $t \"$f\"\n\ndone\nBut I'm not that used to using terminal. \n1.

Ctime actually records the time of the last status change (which may or may not be creation time).\nOS X seems to store other data in extended attributes, but this is not what the script does.\n\nA: Here is the tip I like for getting people used to the finder and terminal.\nHave one finder window open showing the folder and have a terminal window below it.\nType - c, d, space and then drag the folder into the window of the terminal.\ncd \n\nThe POSIX path of the finder folder will then be pasted into the window. Press enter/return and you will now be in the directory you need.\nThat lets the script you mentioned run. Also, please be sure you have a good backup and know how to use it. Terminal commands with * can sometimes match more files than you expected. Something like rm -rf is not \"read mail, really fast\" and can lay waste to priceless pictures and things you have no trash can to undo the remove. Touch is safer in that it will just create lots of new files and chance the access times of other files - but it's best to learn caution and have a backup when you start automating file operations. Good Luck and feel free to ask more automation questions here as you grow more confident or run into issues.\n", "Q: Encrypted disk does not accept password on Mac I made an encrypted backup disk, and I've entered the exact correct password a few times, but system does not accept it.

Is it something wrong with my Mac?\n\nA: A few possibilities:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*cap-locks are inadvertently on now, or when you made the password\n  \n*you cut-paste the password from a 'secret' file, but the password has an extra space at the end?\n  \n*You are typing an 'oh' instead of a 'zero' when you look at your hand-written notes?\n  \n*You have changed your 'default keyboard' from U.S. to British, or something odd like that?\n  \n\nJust my two cents.\n", "Q: How can I hide the Biography and Similar Artists panel in iTunes? For one of the artists on my iTunes music library, I've purchased music from iTunes Store. With iTunes 12, there's now a Biography panel and Similar Artists panel on the right that I can't get rid of - so far I've disabled \"Show Apple Music\" in the General preferences, and I've also disabled \"Apple Music Connect\" in the Parental preferences. Unfortunately it's still showing. Is there any way to not have that panel show?\n\nA: I have yet to update my iTunes (and now I'm starting to think I should avoid it all together!) I was, however, able to search an Apple discussion board and found this to be the closest fix (hopefully) to what you are asking for:\nGo to Edit>Preferences>Parental>Check the Apple Music Connect>Restart iTunes.\nApparently this user has a PC but they said they assume it will be easy to do on a Mac as well.\nHere's the link to the discussion board I referenced.

My base OS is Yosemite.\nNow when rEFInd starts up, I still see the option for OS X and Ubuntu but no option for installing Ubuntu.\nWhen I click the Ubuntu option it says \"error: no such partition. entering recovery mode\"\nAny ideas on how to resolve this? Any and all input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nUPDATE:\nI attempted to start up GParted again to see if I missed something and now rEFInd isn't seeing it either?

I was attempting to get my WiFi working (It works for OS X but didn't work for Ubuntu, GParted, or Tails. but I'll cross that bridge later). I used rEFInd to load it, and used GParted to delete it.\n\nA: Please refer to my answer to another question involving similar difficulties. The method is the exact same, except you should skip step 4 and use the Ubuntu ISO instead.\nBefore attempting anything though, remove all traces of your previous failed installation attempts from the Mac.\n", "Q: How to bind hostname with ip? There are 2 VMs running on VMWare on a remote server. For instance: devops-01 and devops-02. Both of them have SSH access enabled.\nTo access to the first one I do: ssh dev@devops-01. For the other one: ssh dev@192.168.80.y (y sometimes changes). \nNormally I only used devops-01 and rarely the other one. Today, it all changed. Ideally I would like to access both VMs like this: ssh dev@devops-<ID>. But, I'm sure that involves calling the server guy and he's on vacations. So, I thought in \"switching\" my VMs settings.  \nI copied all the settings from System Preferes > Network > Ethernet from the devops-01 and pasted them to the devops-02 corresponding settings. (IP, Subnet Mask, Router, DNS Server, Search Domains are the same).\nI also went to System Preferences > Sharing and edited the computer name on devops-02. (So now, it says devops-01).\nThen, I stoped the old devops-01 VM. And now, I have the old devops-02 VM running, supplanting devops-01. BUT ping devops-01says that there is no route to it. Of course it works fine using the ip. But, that's not my intention.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you'd like a hostname to direct you to a specific IP address of your choice. If so, edit the hosts file located in /etc/hosts by adding a line like this below the localhost entry:\n123.45.67.89 devops-01\nAgain, correct me if I'm misunderstanding you.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone not have any audio during phone calls? My iPhone 5 is having a strange problem that affects phone calls only.  (And yes, I've tried rebooting.)\nRegular Phone Call\nWhen I call someone, or someone calls me (whether via iPhone or non-iPhone), the call seems to connect, but there is no audio for either participant.  They can't hear me, and I can't hear them.\nThe result is the same whether using speakerphone or not.\nMicrophone & Speaker OK?\nThe microphone works fine -- I can make Facetime calls (either audio or video), I can have it convert my speech into text, etc.\nThe speaker you hold up to your ear works fine -- I can hear just fine on Facetime calls.\nThe speaker you use to broadcast sound to everyone nearby works fine, too -- I can play music and watch videos.\nNetwork Behavior OK?\nThe phone's ability to connect to the cellular network seems normal, too.  I can make and receive Facetime calls via the cellular network, connect to the internet, and send/receive texts (for both iPhones and non-iPhones).\n\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?  (Or at least diagnose it further...)\n(After months of trying things, I was unable to fix the phone and simply bought a new one.)\n\nA: Go into settings on your iPhone then General -> Accessibility, scroll down Call Audio Routing and finally tick Automatic.

During your next phone call, press the Bluetooth button and select iPhone.\n", "Q: Favoriting a song in iTunes scrolls to top and collapses album view So.. this issue has been killing me for a while. I imagine others are having this too, so I am going to post quite a bit of info here.\nThe issue is pretty basic. When I have an album open in iTunes I can double click a song to play it. All goes well, but when I click the heart next to the song (to remove or add a favorite) the album view will collapse and then I will be scrolled to the top of the albums view window.\nThis issue persists between operating systems, too. For example if I favorite a song in iTunes on a Windows machine, the same behavior occurs (although the album view isn't collapsed in Windows for some reason).\nHere is the bug in action documented via GIF image:\n\nI have a feeling this is specific to my user account, so here is some history that may be helpful.\nI subscribed to iTunes match before Apple Music was here. I cancelled my iTunes match account before Apple Music came out.\nI am now an Apple Music subscriber and I have a mix of Apple Music and purchased content. Favoriting a song from either source causes the issue.\n\nA: I think I might know the answer to this one: Go to the 'Albums' dropdown in the toolbar (nearly top-right) and turn off 'Show Recently Added'.\nWhat might be happening is that a two-year old bug around one of the elements in the Recently Added section is getting focus, which scrolls the entire view to the top.

I have built a web app that I want to distribute to Mac users (using Safari on OS X). What's the best way to do that?\nGoogle, for example, has Chrome Hosted Apps and Chrome Packaged Apps (for web apps, not mobile) that can be distributed through the Google Play.\nBest I can tell, (Apple) App Store only contains mobile apps for iOS. And all the OS X apps seem to be developed by Apple only? And not by any third party developers.\nChrome Hosted Apps, as an example in contrast, makes the process simple. All you have to do is create a JSON file with some meta data about the app and upload the app to Google Play. Then the download is just a simple link to the URL of your web app. Done. I'm looking for something similar from Apple. Or are they just out of the web app game?\n\nA: Apple does not have a dedicated web app store or platform. Apple's iOS App Store and the Mac App Store both require an app bundle be submitted.\nIt is possible to wrap up a locally hosted web site as an application. A minimal amount of code is required for this approach. This can then be submitted to Apple for review and possible inclusion.\nSee results for the search wrap web site in ios app webview for possible implementation approaches.\n", "Q: How to re-install deb package from MobileTerminal (iOS) [jailbroken] I am trying to run a command to re-install an already installed package.

I'm replacing the hard drive in my 2009 macbook (13\" unibody). How do I go about installing OSX and can I go straight to Yosemite or do I have to install Mavericks and then upgrade? \nIt's my first attempt at replacing a hard drive so I've no idea what to expect.\nThanks all!\n\nA: You can use the drivers CD present in the MacBook box at the time of acquisition. Following the steps you can instal an old version and then update to the last one. Otherwise there should be the possibility of start a recovery and directly download (using a WiFi connection) the last versione of the OS.\nAn other option is to use Time Machine, if and only if, you have previously made a backup of the entire system before the swap of HD.\n\nA: The more recent versions of OS X include a software called Recovery Disk Assistant. You need\n\n\n*\n\n*an empty USB disk or stick of sufficient capacity (8 GB or more)\n\n*the OS X install disk image for Yosemite\n\n*and the software, which you can also download if you don't find it in your Utilities folder within the Applications folder.\n\n\nAlternatively, use the terminal and the createinstallmedia command as described in this Apple Support link.\nIf your MacBook has an SD card slot, you can also create the recovery disk on an SD card. Just be aware that all previous content is lost when you let Recovery Disk Assistant loose on the volume.\nIf you are missing the OS X Yosemite install disk image, visit the past purchases tab in the App Store - it should be right there.\nMake your recovery disk, then reboot with the new hard drive and the USB recovery volume in place and install Yosemite.

The more people who offer feedback with this concern, the more likely they will be to improve and refine the reporting tools.\nDelicate Balance\nTo fully debug a problem, it is likely some amount of personal information will be needed. If only to recreate the problems caused by unexpected paths, file, and folder names. This is a delicate balance and one where Apple needs to demonstrate to its customers that privacy is taken seriously.\nAs of OS X 10.11, Apple's system_profiler tool does include flags that explicitly exclude personal information.\nAs an anecdote, I have previously reported bugs to Apple that involved HP hardware. Apple contacted me asking for permission to pass on my Mac's diagnostic information to HP; that request acknowledged the private information embedded in the bug report.

Why and how do I solve this? It happened few hours ago - I tried to switch the MacBook Pro mid 2012 on from sleep. It doesnt switch on for some reason. I then shut the lid and suddenly the apple icon behind the screen lights up and I open the lid. But what I see is a screen of vertical stripes only in various colors, mainly different shades of gray. How do I fix this and why did this happen?\n\nA: This is a common problem with 2012-2013 Macbook pro's, and is caused by the connection to the GPU card cracking. Apple is offering a repair program where they will fix this for free. If you have an Apple Store near you, I would suggest taking it in and having them fix it.\n", "Q: iCloud hacked and Macbook Pro locked I was away on business and on returning found my Macbook Pro at home locked out. Turns out someone hacked my Apple ID which I was able to recover but I don't know the PIN.

(Check the folder \"Spam\")\n\n\nA: Based on IconDaemon's response, I removed the RAM and pressed cmd+option+P+R to reset the firmware password and rebooting back resolved this issue (since I had recovered my iCloud account and reset the password).\n\nA: This may not be a complete answer, but off the top of my head, I would turn the Macbook off, then turn it back on while holding down Cmd+R to boot into Recovery Mode.  Then open a terminal window, and as long as FileVault isn't turned on, you can change the password for any user using the single command resetpassword (which I personally feel is incredibly insecure, but that's beside the point).\nThen, restart normally, log in as the user with the new password, and completely disable iCloud, or if you have the service secured now with an updated password, everything should be fine.  Just to be safe, I would remove your iCloud account and then re-add it.  That may be over-doing it, but it's just what I would do if it were me.\nIf worse comes to worst, just reboot into Recovery Mode holding Cmd+R (as stated above) and do a restore from your latest Time Machine backup.\nIf you have iCloud access securely-restored as you said, there may be a way to unlock remotely using FindMyiPhone (which also registers other devices) if that option is enabled on the computers you wish to unlock.\n\nA: The same problem happened with me a pair days ago. But finally I was lucky and now my iMac, iPhone and iPad are unlocked and being safe.\nHere is my story (use Google Translate or Google Chrome to read this in English): http://serdeles.livejournal.com/636852.html\nIf hackers didn't change password to your ID, it is cool. If they do, it's sad. First I thought they've changed my password and deleted my ID because when I tried to login in my Apple ID I was noticed there is no such Apple ID. But then I noticed in my iPad settings some unknown ID. Not mine. I used this ID as a login with my password. This trick helped. I changed back my ID. I logged in iCloud and turned off the Lost devices mode. \nGood Luck!\nHope, this information is useful.\n", "Q: Logging in automatically without removing the password Is there any way to have OSX log in automatically in a certain account when starting up, without asking for the password, while preventing remote (or even local network) connections without password? \nI have a computer that I use both as a home server and a media center, so it has to be accessible from outside world in a secure manner (SSH + Screen Sharing), but at the same time I don't want to key in the passwords every time my media center boots up, or more importantly each time it wakes up from sleep.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. An automatic login option is available within the System Preferences.\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Automatic login\nThis ability may not be available if you are using FileVault.\nWhen setting up this option, you will need to provide the user's password. See Does activating auto-login compromise secure password storage? for a discussion about how this feature works.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro later 2011 with El Capitan Version 10.11.1 (15B42) crashing with no reason I don't know yet what is causing this issue.

pro running the latest El Capitan.  The screen would just go black then a white apple logo would appear.  Log back into the system and a kernel panic message would be presented.\nIt turns out that the Spotlight index database had been corrupted.  Not certain as to how the database got corrupted, perhaps software installs with large file and directory numbers.\nThe corruption was corrected by using System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy to remove the existing spotlight database.  When you get into the Spotlight Privacy window no existing directory or drive will be present.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create one by adding the Macintosh HD by selecting the \"+\" and then reboot the system.\n\n*Once the system is up, open System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy again and remove the added Macintosh HD.\n\n*Reboot the system once again\n\n\nThis should solve the corrupted Spotlight database and the reboot/kernel panic should not occur.\n\nA: Try fixing permissions.\nIn El Capitan, the disk utility's first aid no longer includes a fix permissions button. But you can do it via the terminal. \nTo verify permissions\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /\nTo repair permissions, if the previous command finds mismatches\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume /\nThen restart.

Unfortunately the original owner did not reinstall the operating system and in fact it came together with Photoshop and Microsoft Office.\nMy problem is that I am unable to update certain apps (e.g. iPhoto and iMovie), strangely enough I managed to update from Yosemite to El Capitan. \nI tried to format and reinstall the operating system, as many forums suggest doing, however when opening the App Store I still get a prompt to login with the previous owner's email address and I am unable to proceed.\nAlso it's strange that despite reinstalling the OS, I still have pre-installed Photoshop and Office.\nI would prefer not having to contact the owner asking for his password.\nWhat can be done? Did I do something wrong during the OS reinstall (considering Photoshop and Office are still on it)?\n\nA: You'd need to erase, then reinstall OS X. The drive (and all applications as well as the authentication data for that user's Apple ID are kept during the reinstall of OS X. Erasing the drive completely will remove all traces of any data on that drive. However, it will also delete all of your files. I'd recommend doing a manual backup and copy all the files from your desktop, documents, etc. to an external drive. Then enter recovery HD, erase the drive, and reinstall OS X.\n", "Q: Re-installing iTunes 12.2 I am not happy with iTunes 12.3 (it constantly asks for my Apple ID) and I would like to re-install iTunes 12.2.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I find the 12.2 version?\n\n*Will replacing 12.3 by 12.2 lose my music files and other personal data like rankings, subscribed podcasts, playlists, etc?\n\n\nA: This would appear to be the epitome of an XY Problem…\nRather than go to all that effort, would it not be simpler to just set your password requirement to 'Never' ?\n\n\nA: You can download previous versions of iTunes directly from Apple.

I searched and think I have things set up right, but it seems that the scheduled script starts significantly after the requested time. Details at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32829026/using-launched-and-plist-starts-late. Thanks for guidance or experiments to try.\n\nA: Since your per-user launch agent does actually execute, albeit later than scheduled, it is highly likely that your system may be asleep at the scheduled time. I would recommend reading through the man page by running the following command from a terminal session:\n$ man 5 launchd.plist\n\nRegarding the StartInterval option specifically, the man page has this to say:\n\nUnlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep,\n  launchd will start the job the next time the computer wakes up.  If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is woken, those events will\n  be coalesced into one event upon wake from sleep.\n\nIf you are working remotely, or not physically present at the scheduled time — which is not clear from your question — a good starting point would be to confirm that the system has not entered sleep mode prior to the scheduled time of your launch agent.\n\nA: Note that the documentation for StartInterval has changed as of 10.10, see https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/23361 for a thread documenting this change.\nThe new text reads\n\nStartInterval \nThis optional key causes the job to be started every N seconds. If the system is asleep during the time of the next scheduled interval firing, that interval will be missed due to shortcomings in kqueue(3).  If the job is running during an interval firing, that interval firing will likewise be missed.\n\nApparently this has always been 'broken' and the documentation has been updated to reflect that.\nSo the answer is that StartInterval doesn't handle sleep, and you can either prevent sleep (as you found) or switch to another method to trigger your job. For instance StartCalendarInterval does coalesce events after returning from sleep, so that might be a good option.\n\nA: OK, I turned off \"sleep\"ing and the scheduled job starts and ends as expected. My next step is to run with the full 2 hour job run time. I had experimented with the jobs runnings 2 minutes each as a test, and they did. So next step is the real job, but I expect it to work. I'll report when it does. Thanks for the suggestion/solution.\nOK, that was it. It was \"sleep\"ing whenever a job was to start. Not letting it sleep now allows all jobs to run as expected. Thanks.\n", "Q: Superdrive doesn't accept disks any more I have two Superdrives. Since the upgrade to 10.11 (it might just coincide) they don't accept disks any more.

You might be able to get around that with either multiple hard disks, or physically swapping out hard disks.\nYou may also run into issues with very old versions of Windows that may require hardware that your Mac no longer includes.

Thus, there is no computer in existence that can run both 10.3 and 10.6. Also, 10.7 only supports 64-bit Intel CPUs (although a lot of its components include both 32- and 64-bit binaries), and 10.8 also requires 64-bit EFI firmware.\nNo Mac can run an OS older than itself - the hardware didn't exist to write the drivers for it.\nEven in VM, no OS before 10.7 [maybe 10.5/10.6 server iirc, but not non-server] is licensed for VM.\nBoot Camp for running Windows - no Mac old enough to run Windows XP can run Windows 10, because Boot Camp itself limits which OS can be installed.\nFor Unix variants, I invite edits…\n\nA: On Minix, hardware support might be an issue. First of all - are you talking about the original Minix from Andrew Tannenbaum's book, or the latest iteration?\nAccording to http://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=usersguide:hardwarerequirements it requires a computer with a BIOS (not UEFI - although you apparently can use GRUB to circumvent that problem) an MBR-style disk. I think the last one might be what could kill Minix for you; as far as I know, all the Macs use EFI.\nAlso, the amount of hardware supported seems fairly limited; there are only 10 different NICs listed, for instance.

The effects last until the next time Finder is relaunched, which usually won't happen until you log out or reboot.\nSo, the above instructions create a script that automates this process, and set up a login hook to run that script any time a user logs in. The script waits for Finder to launch, then renames /Applications to /Apps and kills Finder. Once Finder has relaunched, the folder is renamed back to /Applications.\n\nQ&A\nDoes this cause any side effects?\nI haven't found any so far! The Applications folder retains its pretty icon, and running path to applications folder in Applescript will still return the correct result.\nDoes this work in other versions of Mac OS X?\nI haven't tested it on Mojave or Catalina, but I suspect it will work without changes in Mojave. In Catalina, you would at minimum need to remount / as read-write; you might try adding sudo mount -uw / before the last line of the script.\nThis method does not work in 10.9 Mavericks, which does not exhibit the Finder quirk I described above. I don't know what will happen on 10.10–10.12, you'd have to try it.\nCan I do this without disabling SIP?\nNope, and you'll need to leave SIP disabled too. The entire purpose of SIP is to prevent users from doing things like this.\nLoginhooks are deprecated, why didn't you use launchd?\nLoginhooks have two very useful properties:\n\n\n*\n\n*They run whenever a user logs in (not just when the system boots)\n\n*They run as root.\n\n\nLaunchAgents get us only #1, and LaunchDemons only #2. That said, running the script as a LaunchDemon will almost work, the only problem is when a user logs out and logs back in (or a second user logs in).\nDo note that according to Apple, your machine can only have one Loginhook at a time. So on the off chance you already have a Loginhook set up for something else, you need to add the code to your existing script instead of creating a new one.\nWhy go through all this trouble? You can't just hold down the cmd key?\nI realize I'm being a bit crazy, but this has legitimately bothered me for years. I don't like the inconsistency of it. /Applications is just a folder, and god damnit, it should behave the same way as any other folder. This comment I left on Hacker News a while back might also provide some insight into why I'm so annoyed by the behavior: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20224370\nMaybe no one else will use this, but I wanted to have the solution documented. (I just wish it worked on Mavericks—I'm trying to move my life to Mavericks.)\n", "Q: Reverting back to Mavericks from El Capitan Ever since I downloaded El Capitan I have lost the ability to Drag & Drop photos into Pages documents I am creating.  Also in Pages, Certificate templates, for example, are not able to be edited.  I can open the template but can not do anything with it, cannot edit any changes.

I backed up all important files and formatted the drive, so to install Windows 10 from a WININSTALL USB drive, I created on a different computer. I've tried as many things as I could think of, or find online, even going as far as to do a full wipe of the entire Hard Drive.\nBoot Camp Assistant, when functional, give me the error that \"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has a mbr partition table, On EFI system window can only be installed to GPT disks.\"\nInstalling on a partition of pure Free Space returns the error \"Windows could not update the computer's boot configuration.

Just go out to your local Target, WalMart, Best Buy, what have you, and buy some DVD-Rs. A ten pack cost me $7.00. I then burned the Windows 10 ISO to one of them and installed from there. Worked like a charm. Only problem was I had trouble booting into Mac OSX after the installation, but I'm sure I'll figure that out, too. I will update this (hopefully) when all is 100% up to snuff.\n\nA: Does your laptop have a single drive or are you using a 2nd hard drive?  \nIf you have a 2nd drive, I would try wiping the hard drive again, so it has neither MBR nor GPT partitioning data anywhere, and then try Boot Camp Assistant on the completely blank hard drive.\n\nA: when booting your mac with option key, you have the choice to select either BIOS-emulated/Legacy WININSTALL or UEFI-WININSTALL. It seems you only tried the 2nd way. the first way let you install windows on MBR schema.\nI did both ways with my mid 2011 MBA and for Windows 10 the MBA hardware behaves differently and I had problems with the internal intel 3000 HD graphics.\nWith BIOS/Legacy install all is fine.\n", "Q: Generate all Calendar.app icons I'd like to get all 366 possible icons that Calendar would have displayed in the Dock.\nHow can you automate the creation of each of these, either in Bash or Automator?\n\n\nA: You should avoid using Apple's artwork for your own projects or where you need to re-distribute the files.

Then went to disk utility and deleted the NewOSX partition, which of course is a simple procedure.  Thanks for the assistance, wish I had realized the simple solution earlier.  \n\nA: Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.\nWhy not just back up your data and wipe the entire partition? I suppose if you want to learn how to move things around and you already have a bootable backup that you've tested, the plan of action you propose might be an interesting learning experience.\nFor anyone that's not sure they can pull off this, Apple posts supported instructions for a wipe and reinstall.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18869\nIt uses the Recovery Partition to perform the wipe.

It just dismisses the dialog and won't install the extension. Is there any way I can install this extension?\n\nA: So after contacting one of the developers of an \"untrusted\" extension, they pointed out that this can be done normally in safe mode. You can boot your Mac in safe mode by holding down Shift when booting.\nBeware that your Mac performs really slow in safe mode, so download the extension you want to install before booting in safe mode.\nThis is the Apple Documentation page which points out there's no need for all extensions to be hosted on Safari Extensions Gallery.\n\nA: Try using the tab key to select \"trust\" and the space bar to click it.

Is it a design flaw or does it serve a different specific purpose?\n\nA: The Mac as a Digital Hub\nThe existence of the ~/Music folder is not a design flaw. The folder is intended for keeping all your music in one location.\nApple's execution of its music strategy is plagued by baggage from earlier decisions and implementations. Maybe Apple's Music application will eventually better integrate with the ~/Music folder. Maybe iTunes will see the rewrite it clearly deserves.\nAs to why the Music folder exists at all, that is related to the premise of the Mac becoming a digital hub for all your content.\nOrganising Your Content\nWhen Apple released Mac OS X, they designated a series of standard folders for their customers to use. These include ~/Documents, ~/Pictures, and ~/Public. Each folder had an intended purpose.\n\nOver time those meaning have subtly changed or been diluted. Most however, remain largely faithful to the original design. Apple's iTunes application stores music in the ~/Music folder. Apple's iPhotos and Photos applications store photos in the ~/Photos folder.\nBeyond Apple\nApple does not claim exclusive use of the folders. Thus Apple's applications and most third party applications create sub-folders within these designated folders for their specific content or material.\nThere are Application Programmer Interfaces (API) that help third party applications locate and use these special folders. Judging by Apple's past actions, these folders are here to stay and only likely to gain greater importance.\n", "Q: How to turn on modal window auto-appearing when program needs your attention Can I make modal windows appear frontmost? I want to see alerts and modals from applications in the background.\nI am new in the Mac world. I have a small utility for the Mac that shows a modal window after some time. Basically, it prints some very useful information for me.\nI am expecting that this modal window will appear while I am working on different things (surfing on internet, reading emails), but instead of seeing the modal window the application annoyingly bounces it's icon in Dock; obvioulsy which means that my software needs my attention.\nThe same thing happens with iTunes, communicators, Safari, etc.\n\nA: Modal dialogs aren't something you can guarantee will show. The OS allows users to use multiple displays, multiple virtual desktops, pin apps to all displays, no displays or a specific display.\nNotification center is the correct tool to send a notice to a user so I would redesign your script/tool/app to make use of notification center.\nAlso, without seeing some bare stub of what you have already, it's really hard to suggest you how to implement a change. Just as on Stack Overflow - if you have a problem with a tool or a script here, please show your work and ask a follow on question to explain exactly what you desire to happen and what you have so far.\nHere's a tiny python script you could try: a little python \"script\" I've adapted from a brief search of SO:\nimport Foundation\nimport objc\nimport AppKit\nimport sys\n\nnote = objc.lookUpClass('NSUserNotification')\ncenter = objc.lookUpClass('NSUserNotificationCenter')\n\ndef notify(title, subtitle, info_text, delay=0, sound=False, userInfo={}):\n    notification = note.alloc().init()\n    notification.setTitle_(title)\n    notification.setSubtitle_(subtitle)\n    notification.setInformativeText_(info_text)\n    notification.setUserInfo_(userInfo)\n    if sound:\n        notification.setSoundName_(\"NSUserNotificationDefaultSoundName\")\n    notification.setDeliveryDate_(Foundation.NSDate.dateWithTimeInterval_sinceDate_(delay, Foundation.NSDate.date()))\n    center.defaultUserNotificationCenter().scheduleNotification_(notification)\n\n\nnotify(\"AskDifferent\", \"you can program now\", \"Here we go... \", sound=True)\nsys.stdout.write(\"Notification sent...\\n\")\n\nIt works on El Capitan without needing any extra files or downloads afaik. Again, there are dozens of options and languages, so it's more about what you want to do long term and if you're comfortable with modifying scripts.\n", "Q: How to transparently mark a picture in preview? I've successfully marked a picture with preview. The only part left is to make that mark transparent so it doesn't block the whole picture. How do I do that?\nHere's an example of what I'm trying to accomplish:\n\nThe \"highlight\" I am getting is this:\n\nAs you can see, the red marking I am trying to put over the picture is blocking everything, and I am not able to \"see through\" the marking. I hope it's more clear now. :)\n\nA: In Yosemite Preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Tools > Annotate > Rectangle. This will create a rectangle with the default attributes. You can resize the rectangle with the handles.\n\n*The Markup toolbar should appear automatically, but if it doesn't, choose View > Show Markup Toolbar.\n\n*The second icon from the right is the fill color. Select that and click Show Colors...\n\n*A color picker comes up that lets you set the opacity.\n\n\nHere are a couple of screenshots of the Preview window showing what I did:\n\nThat's after steps 1 and 2, and I dragged the new rectangle to the right so you can see initially it's completely opaque. The Markup toolbar is the toolbar directly above the image itself.\n\nThis is after step 4, where I used the color picker to change the color to green with a 50% opacity. I also removed the outline stroke using the 3rd icon form the right in the Markup toolbar. In the Markup toolbar, you can see the second and third icons from the right changed to reflect the new settings.\n\nThat's the color picker you get after you choose Show Colors... from the fill icon in the Markup toolbar. Note that the picker itself might be different depending on which one you last used, but all I've seen have Opacity at the bottom. You can change the picker itself using the icons at the top.\n", "Q: Is it possible to transfer images from iPhone to SD card directly? There is: http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MD822ZM/A/lightning-to-sd-card-camera-reader\n\nIt’s easy to download photos and videos from your digital camera to your iPad or iPad mini\nAfter you insert the SD card into the reader, your iPad automatically opens the Photos app, which lets you choose which photos and videos to import, then organises them into albums.\n\n\n*\n\n*Description mentions only iPad (not iPhone)\n\n*Description mentions copying from SD card into the device\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to do?\nTravelling. Don't want to take computer with me. I'd rather rather use a spacious SD card and use it a storage to offload photos / videos to keep my internal memory free (allowing me to shoot / record more)\nPossible?\n\nA: From my own testing, I have verified that unfortunately, you can only use the SD card reader with the iPad. You can also only transfer photos/videos from the SD card to the iPad, not the other way around. I think these would be great features (take it from a 8GB iPhone 5c owner) to have, but unfortunately they are not available at this time.\nYou can send feedback to Apple at http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html as I have.\nEdit: Now you can use the Lightning to SD Card adapter with the iPhone if you update to iOS 9.2! However, you can still only import from the SD card to the iOS Device and not from iOS Device to SD card. They have even updated the item description to mention iPhones at http://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MJYT2AM/A/lightning-to-sd-card-camera-reader.

It is, however, the only I/O port that both my Macs have. I want to access the internet from the mobile, new MacBook via the stationary, old iMac and sometimes I may want to access files on the iMac or use its large screen in addition to the small laptop screen. \nI know I can do these things using (some perhaps non-free third-party software, at least for screen sharing, and) AirPort, either by setting up a dedicated router or by running the iMac as an adhoc wifi network “server”. The latter only offers insecure WEP encryption, however, and the former is not possible in my case. Cable connections are obviously more secure and they tend to be both faster and more stable.\nThere are protocols for Ethernet over USB (CDC-ECM etc.) and I could probably achieve all of my goals via LAN, but I’m not sure how (well) this is supported in OS X (10.6 on the iMac, 10.10 on the MB), especially for connecting two computers instead of some gadget (or industrial machinery) to a Mac.\n\nA: Best solution would be to either upgrade the iMac to 10.8+ and get WPA2 wifi sharing, or just get any cheap router.\nYou can't use any sort of regular USB cable for a host-to-host setup, solutions do exist but are definitely a lot more expensive, and much more fiddly software-wise, than either a cheap router or simply a thunderbolt to firewire adapter for your Macbook, which might be your best bet since Macs have native support for sharing internet over firewire.\n", "Q: Assigning different ringtone for non-contacts I'm using iOS 9.1 and I want to assign one ringtone for all known contacts and a different one for non-contacts.\nI also have another ringtone for a few specific contacts, but in general I want to know if the person who's calling is on my contact list.\nHow can this be achieved without any jailbreaks or the like ?\nI'm also aware that I could just define a ringtone for my entire contacts list. But this is just inconvenient. Every time I add a contact on my Google Account I would have to assign the ringtone on the iPhone.\n\nA: I have assigned the same ringtone to everyone in my contact list, and it took days. Then I selected a different default ringtone, and I know that when I hear this, the caller is not a contact. But I would suggest adding this feature for iPhone 7, because it's important.\n\nA: Wouldn't setting the default ringtone to \"unknown contact ringtone\" and assigning every single contact your \"known contact ringtone\" be a valid solution...? :)\n\nA: I'm late to the party but can offer a partial solution. \nInstall the Hiya app which blocks spam and telemarketers. Contracts are not blocked. It takes a couple of rings' time for it to do the lookup of unknown numbers and block the bad call. \nCreate a ringtone that is about 3 seconds of silence at the beginning. \nIf a call comes in your phone won't make a sound initially. If the call becomes blocked by Hiya you won't hear it at all. \nBut if the call is not blocked you'll then hear the rest of your ringtone play.\nNot a perfect solution since you don't know a legitimate call is coming in until x-second late. And it doesn't address the vibrate function. \n", "Q: Yosemite cannot detect SD card I know their is a flood of these questions but I have a late 2013 macbook pro with yosemite 10.10.5 installed on it.\nMy problem is it won't read some of my SD cards, i've run disk util with the pny sd card inserted and I get this\nbash-3.2$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         120.5 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *120.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 F57E540D-B47C-40C6-BDE1-F9EEB04734AB\n                                 Unencrypted\nbash-3.2$ \n\nWhats strange is when I insert another sd card (a samsung card) It comes up OK \nbash-3.2$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         120.5 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *120.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2\n                                 F57E540D-B47C-40C6-BDE1-F9EEB04734AB\n                                 Unencrypted\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk2\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 NO NAME                 8.0 GB     disk2s1\nbash-3.2$ \n\nI've tested the PNY cards in my iPad with an sd card reader and the photos come up OK, and all the photos appear on my camera as well so the SD card themselves seem to be OK \n\nA: It's fairly common for recent MBPs to have somewhat glitchy SD card readers. With certain cards, and especially with cheaper microSD adapters, I have to make sure I don't push the card all the way in or it might either not show up at all, or show up but keep getting ejected mid-write.\n\nA: If you're convinced it's software (or want to rule that out), you can download the 10.9 installer (or other) and run it to install the OS onto an external drive. It's probably not that, but you can rule that in or out.\nBefore going to that length, open terminal and look at the following command - before you insert the card and then compare after inserting and waiting 15 seconds.\nsystem_profiler SPCardReaderDataType\n\nYou can also get this information in the System Information app. Open the Hardware triangle if needed and then select Card Reader\nYou can press Command R to refresh the window - so wait the 15 seconds after inserting to be sure the system has polled. You should see that the card itself reads quite rapidly, and depending on the filesystem - it might be running through a slow fsck check before showing it in Finder.\nBasically, you can tell if the hardware negotiates at a low level pretty reliably and the software delay is in how thorough a check is running or if you need to use Disk Utility to erase and repartition/reformat the storage card.\n\nA: I am having a similar problem. I put the (FAT formatted) card in the slot of my iMac and I can see the muted volume on Disc Utility and also on the system report. However, it will not show on the desktop and, intermittently, I can use Go To Folder and sometimes it will show in the list of volumes but will not allow opening (Road Closed sign). Other times it will allow full path and shows all the files. This has happened on two cards from two different devices, If I format the SD card on the iMac it will function properly.\nAll this is a new phenomenon and has worked with both cameras and both SD cards. Command line in terminal works OK and shows everything.\nIt makes me think I should Zap the Pram ? People say that cures a host of problems\n", "Q: How to setup DMZ with Airport behind a router (double NAT issue)? My cable provider shipped a new modem which includes WLAN, and thus also a router. It hands out 192.168.0.X adresses via DHCP.\nMy Airport's WAN side is connected to this router, and gets an address out of the above range. The ISP's router has no address reservation facility, so the address that the Airport gets can vary.\nThe Airport is configured to hand out 192.168.243.X addresses via it's own DHCP server. As expected it complains about \"double NAT\". For the moment I have fixed the issue by disabling the ISP's router and WLAN completely (bridge mode).\nHowever, I'd actually like to use the feature. My desired setup would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*ISP's Router\n\n*Airport, using e.g. 192.168.0.10\n\n*Web Server, opening port 80, using e.g. 192.168.0.20. The ISP's router supports port forwarding, so I can do this.\n\n\nOn the Airport's LAN side, I'd like to span an independent 192.168.243.x subnet, that cannot be reached from the web server. In a way, the web server would be in a \"DMZ\", isolated from the rest of my home network.\nThe problem is: The Airport doesn't let me do this! When I connect any device to the LAN side of the Airport, I get a 192.168.0.x address from the ISP's router, and not a 192.168.243.x address from the Airport. The Airport acts like it is in bridge mode, even though it isn't.\nHow can I set this up the way I want to?\n\nA: Out of the box, the Airport (and Apple's Time Capsule) insist that there not be two NAT/DHCP devices chained in a row. You're trying to do this, one being your broadband router, and the other your Airport. In this situation, the Airport will insist on being in bridging mode and letting the broadband router be the DHCP server. \nThe Airport detects this situation by looking at the IP address it gets. If it is one in a number of known ranges like 192.168.x.x, 172.x.x.x, or 10.x.x.x, it will balk. \nSo the way you get around this is by having your broadband router give out addresses in a range that's safe but not knows as a \"private\" address range. I found an article [1] recommending a block of addresses designated for \"testing\" purposes in the Amateur Packet Radio network (AMPRNet). The range is 44.128.x.x.  I set up my broadband router to use that range, and my TimeCapsule is happy to provide NAT as well. Problem solved.\n[1] http://www.wa4dsy.com/robot/ooma-airport-hack\n\nA: Turn of the DHCP server on your ISP's router. It might be answering faster than the AirPort DHCP server.\n", "Q: MBP SSD impending failure Configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2014 MBPr - Loaded (1TB SSD, etc.)\n\n*Mavericks\n\n*Bootcamp with Win7\n\n*Paragon NTFS driver\n\n\nI think my SSD may be failing. Recently, some files have started to go missing.\nSpecifically, I'll add a new file to an Xcode project, and things seem to work fine for the most part. Occasionally, Xcode gets in a mood where it is constantly saying that a specific file has been modified outside of the environment by another application - even when nothing else is running. \nWhen rebooting, or waking up, the new file tends to be either corrupt, unreadable (with a \"input/output error\" message in terminal) or completely missing.\nIf I reboot into Win7 - Bootcamp, not a VM - and try to read the file - from an NTFS volume - the file will show up in a directory listing (command line). If I try to cat the file, I'll get a \"The file does not exist\" message. After that, the file no longer appears in the directory listing.\nIf I then reboot into OSX, the file will also be missing from the directory listing.\nThis seems to be happening more and more frequently lately.\nI've tried removing the Paragon NTFS driver. I still get read errors on some files.\nI suspect that the SSD is failing. Is there any cheap / free, reliable SSD diagnositic tool available that runs under OSX? I'd rather not have Apple send this thing off for repair for a week as I need the machine to do my job.\nHelp!\n\nA: There is an app named DriveDx that can show you if there are problems with the drive. Not that it is 100% full proof but better than nothing.\nAlso I remember I had issues with Paragon NTFS too (like file system corruption). Microsoft changes NTFS with each release and it is not \"open source\", so it is not known how compatible Paragon is. I am sure they do their best but it is difficult to be compatible with such closed system as NTFS.\n", "Q: I cant get into my iphone 5c, becuase the screen doesnt work, and i want to recover my photos my phone recently broke, and the screen when I touch it doesn't do anything.

I tried syncing it to iTunes but it wont work unless I unlock it, which is not possible. And I'm positive I made an icloud that shares family stuff but I don't know to view it. \n\nA: Tyson 's answer will probably work, but it would require that you enabled photo stream before your phone broke. If you didn't, you're kinda out of luck unless you've backed up your phone to your computer previously. \nIf you have backed it up before, you can use tools like iExplorer (free demo, $35) to read the iTunes backups. They do, however, make you purchase the software if you actually want to pull the photos out, but it may be worth it to some depending on how much they want their photos.

Can anyone help?  \n\nA: There are two options that are most likely.\nOption #1:\nSomeone has gained access to your iCloud account and has been adding reminders remotely. If this is the case, you should be grateful that they are just adding reminders as they could do far more. \nSolution #1:\nReset your iCloud password immediately and set up two-factor authentication. \nOption #2:\nSomeone has gained physical access to your iPhone and either knows the password or your phone is unprotected. \nSolution #3:\nChange your phone password to something other than 1234, and make sure that it is enabled all the time. \nLastly, remove the reminders. \n", "Q: Thunderbolt ports on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) stopped working I purchased my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) just a few months ago for one specific purpose. I use it at my church to run the projector. It's connected through VGA, so I've been using a MiniDisplay to VGA adaptor (Apple Online Store). It worked great until last week. All the sudden it wouldn't recognize the Projector display. Sometimes I can get it to work for 30 seconds or so, then it may flicker in and out some and go away or sometimes it just drops the signal right off the bat. During troubleshooting I tried hooking into a couple flat screens via VGA and got the same thing. I've confirmed that everything else from the projector to the adaptor work correctly.\nAt first I thought it may be a short in the MiniDisplay to VGA adaptor so I  bought 2 more adaptors and tried them and still had the same problem. My friend brought his Macbook Pro and it worked perfect using all 3 adaptors. So I've been able to narrow the problem down to the MBP, but I have no clue what it could be. I've tried resetting PRAM and Management Unit even though I don't think that applies to the MBP.\nI'm running Yosemite 10.10.5. I haven't upgraded to El Capitan yet due to my presenter software not being compatible with it yet. I would really appreciate any advice. Not sure if this is a software or hardware issue either?

Lots of octal escapes, none of which are the ASCII values of the new password.\nThe second has a hexadecimal string of about eighty digits, then in quotes, about 60 characters, most of which are octal escapes.\nSpeculation: the hexadecimal is a decryption or encryption key, the quoted string when converted to bytes and decrypted is the password, and that is a format keychain can't handle and/or Skype is encrypting to prevent people from looking up a password in keychain.\n\nA: Skype does not seem to be able to ave the password on the keychian in a way the app can read.

To see the result of\n2000 × 19% / 12\n\nI used both the Mac's Calculator app (with El Capitan or Mavericks), vs on the iPhone with iOS 9.1.\nOn the Mac, when I press 2000, ×, 19, %, it gives me 380, but when I press the division button ÷, then it gives 760000 right away, and finishing with pressing 12, = gives 63333.33333333.\nOn the iPhone, I do get the expected result:  31.6666.  So how can this be understood and how can it be done on the Mac?\n\nA: Here's a short article that does a good job of describing the behaviour you're observing with OS X's in-built Calculator app: How does the calculator percent key work?\nWhat's going on?\nWhen performing an operation involving two values followed by the percent key, the product is first calculated (i.e. 2000 x 19 % = 380) and this then replaces the second value in the ongoing calculation, which becomes 2000 x 380. When you then press the division key ÷ the product of the ongoing operation is calculated (2000 x 380 = 760,000), as you described, before you input the divisor to perform another operation.\nWorking with percentages using OS X's in-built Calculator\nTo work with percentages in this instance you should express them in decimal form:\n2000 × 0.19 ÷ 12\n= 31.6666\n\nThis works with both iOS's and OS X's Calculator. I would advise against using the percent key in favour of working with decimals. The same can be said when using physical calculators, where the behaviour can differ between models. Recent upgrades of macOS have fixed this order of operations change if you need to enter % as described.\n\nA: I would use PCalc for more accurate calculations if edge cases that expose the reality of floating point math is something you consider broken for your needs or the order of operations isn't as you expect.\nUpgrading to Monterey fixes the issue you mentioned and the result is 31.666666666666667\n", "Q: Is it possible to bind my Mac OSX Dictionary.app to Google Translate? The Dictionary App has a very cool experience on MacOSX. But I have to install dictionaries to use. Is it possible to bind it to Google Translate?\nThanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be possible, or at least straightforward. As an alternative, you may want to consider creating an OS X Service that opens Google Translate in a browser window, for any highlighted word or phrase you have selected.\nIf this sounds suitable, follow the procedure below:\nCreating a translation Service\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator app from your Applications folder\n\n*Select Service as the type of document and click Choose\n\n*In the window that appears, click the search field and type 'AppleScript'\n\n*Drag and drop the Run AppleScript action from the list on the left into the area labelled 'Drag actions or files here to build your workflow'\n\n\nCopy the script below and paste it into the Run Applescript action:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set phrase to input as string\n    set phrase to quoted form of phrase\n\n    set ui_lang to \"en\"\n    set from_lang to \"en\"\n    set to_lang to \"zh-CN\"\n\n    do shell script \"open 'https://translate.google.com/?hl='\" & ui_lang & \"'&sl='\" & from_lang & \"'&tl='\" & to_lang & \"'&text='\" & phrase\nend run\n\nYour window should look like the following:\n\nThere are three values that you may want to change in the above script:\n\n\n*\n\n*ui_lang - the language used for the page interface\n\n*from_lang - the source language\n\n*to_lang - the destination language\n\n\nChange one or more of these to achieve the desired translation.

I have a 4GB usb stick plugged into the computer. It should be enough for windows 7, a partition which no longer boots and I am hoping to run startup repair on it from the install USB so I don't have to start over clean.\ntutorial: http://tsentas.net/create-a-windows-7-or-later-version-install-disk-missing-on-el-capitan/\nThis is the screen I get after following this tutorial where the Info.plist file of bootcamp is modified to let the USB creation happen (same screen as before):\n\nHas anyone encountered this issue? \n\nA: I know this is an older thread, but I had to combine several items as mentioned in other answers to get this to work on my iMac running OS Sierra (mac os 10.12.5).\nInstead of disabling SIP, I copied the Boot Camp Assistant to my desktop, allowing me to edit the contents without disabling.  I still had to add the administrator as a read/write user by ctrl-clicking on the new Boot Camp icon, and selected show package contents.  Edit the permissions for the content folder and for the info.plist file.  \nOnce I was able to get into the contents and edit the info.plist file using Xcode, I had to remove the 'pre' from the USBBootSupported Models key and add my model version there.  I also had to add the model version to the ExternalInstallOnlyModels key as Sohma pointed out.  Took  a bit of work, but I once I edited the correct keys, I was able to select the option in Boot Camp Assistant to create a Windows 8 Bootable USB.\n\nA: Here's what you need to do. On El Capitan, you don't have permission to edit the info.plist file, and giving yourself that permission is not possible without disabling the rootless feature in terminal, which I would not recommend. Instead, simply copy Boot Camp Assistant to another folder, then you will be able to edit and use that copy. I copied it to my Downloads folder, edited the info.plist file to include my model identifier and it worked on the first try. No reboot, no nonsense.\nIf you're using a text editor, it may look something like this. Just look for the USBBootSupportedModels key (if it says PreUSB, change it to just USB), then add a string with your computer's model identifier.\n\nEdit: You may still have to give yourself permissions to the app after copying it, but the copy enables you to do just that. Simply click the app, and go to File > Get Info, then at the bottom of the window that pops up, give yourself permission.\nEdit 2: There are several places that might block / allow your mac model from creating an image. I found that adding my model to <key>ExternalInstallOnlyModels</key> did the trick.\n\nA: If you find no option to select your external USB drive as an ISO target - are instead directed to install on your repartitioned hard drive immediately - open the info.plist and add your model identifier to the following:\n<key>ExternalInstallOnlyModels</key>\n<array>\n    <string>MacBook8,1</string>\n    <string>MacBook9,1</string>\n    <string>MacBookAir7,1</string>\n    <string>MacBookPro11,5</string>\n</array>\n\n\nA: You will need to disable SIP on the Mac and then it will allow you to edit the Info.Plist \n\nA: I m just a dentist whom happens to be a geek ..I was lucky but i just copied the boot camp to the desktop  edited the info.plist on xcode then just rased the preusb... opened the bootcamp again and voila i had the create a  win7 usb option ..\nDoes this make anysens to you guys ? \n", "Q: How to get previous shutdown cause?

You can see exactly what it is doing by taking a peek inside /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal:\ngrep \"truncating history files\" /etc/* 2> /dev/null\n/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal:     echo -n 'truncating history files...'\n", "Q: Is there a way to import stopwatch data into Numbers? I use the stopwatch app to collect data sometimes, and often I'll have ~100 datapoints. (as an example, my light creaks periodically after I turn it off after leaving it on for a long time, so I timed that once to find out how the period of the creaking changes over time). After recently getting an iPhone 6s with iOS 9, I tried using the Numbers app to graph some results. However, typing in the ~100 results is a bit tedious, and I was wondering if there was a way to transfer the data from the stopwatch to Numbers. \n\nA: Down load BEST STOPWATCH and there is a copy option. This can then be transferred to an email or text. Then the data can be copied into a spread sheet. \n", "Q: FileVault: What exactly is the optimizing step about? After enabling FileVault on El Capitan the partition is encrypted in a first pass. After this phase is complete a second optimizing phase is starting which takes considerably longer than the first encryption phase. The optimizing step was not present on the first appearance of FileVault 2 (OS X Lion). The encryption phase took the same amount of time back then. So what is this optimizing all about ?\nMy system is a mid 2014 MBP with 1 TB SSD. 1st phase was done in about 12 hours. 2nd optimizing phase is now at 20 hours and counting.\n\n\nA: FileVault 2 is optimizing data on your system drive before it gets full disk encryption (FDE) to speed up encryption/decryption process. Sometimes optimization stage can take a very long time to complete. It depends on a capacity of your disk and an amount of data it stores on.\nYou can use coreStorage command in Terminal to see the status of encryption:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nor:\ndiskutil cs list | grep -e \"Conversion\" -e \"Volume Name\"\n\nTo see the other useful commands look at this page: Set a FileVault recovery key for Mac .\n", "Q: Remove iTunes and Mac App store results when looking for a word I would like to know whether it is possible to remove the Itunes Store and Mac App Store results from the word look-up functionality in El Capitan 10.11.1, illustrated below:\n\nand App Store:\n\nI find the attached look-up results pointless and irrelevant.\n\nA: As you can see here, you can disable some \"Search results\" from Spotlight or Look up.

Which is an integral part of the OS (bear with me here...) Usually when you are having OS problems I recommend installing the latest update via a combo updater downloaded directly from support.apple.com.\nCombo updaters have all of the patches required for all versions of the OS including hardware variations. When you download it from the App Store you get only the code necessary for your particular Mac. So combo updaters are more complete.\nEl Capitan does not seem to have a Combo Updater as this is all I could find. If you have Yosemite this would be your Combo Updater. If you look at both pages one is called a combo updater and one is not.\nSpeculating on what Apple is doing (or going to do) is both fruitless and (sometimes) fun. So why this is happening, who knows.\nSince there is not a Combo Updater for El Cap (assuming that is what you have) I would download that updater and apply it to your system. If you have Yosemite, the second link. If you have an earlier version, well just google the version you say along with \"combo updater\" and the first link is usually the Apple download page.\nFailing that sometimes just reinstalling the OS and then applying any updates is the way to go. Doing that will rarely wipe any of your data, but do back-up first, just to be safe.\n\nA: You probably set Path Finder as default browser in the Path Finder preferences. \nBefore uninstalling Path Finder, you have to make sure that \"Set as Default Browser\" is disabled in Path Finder's Preferences -> General section.\nTo solve your problem reinstall Path Finder, disable (or enable and disable) \"Set as Default Browser\" in Path Finder's Preferences -> General section and uninstall it again.\n\nA: In the end, this sorted itself out after a restart of the machine.\n", "Q: How do I prevent iTunes opening in a new virtual screen instead of the current one iTunes used to just open on the screen like other apps, but now it always opens in a new virtual screen taking up the whole screen.

See Conversion: String-Date to AppleScript-Date and Dates & Times in AppleScripts for helpful snippets and an overview of approaches.\nThe general approach appears to be to hand code the parsing and conversion. For your example:\nset myStringDate to \"Nov 9 03:21:11\"\n\nset theMonth to first word of myStringDate\nset theDayOfMonth to second word of myStringDate\nset theHour to third word of myStringDate\nset theMinute to fourth word of myStringDate\nset theSecond to fifth word of myStringDate\n\n-- TODO: Add code to convert month to a number\nset theConvertedMonth to theMonth\n\n-- Determine the year somehow\n\nset myTransformedDate to \"YEAR\" & theConvertedMonth & theDayOfMonth & \" \" & theMinute & theHour & theSecond\n\n-- Be aware of numbers of single digits; you may need to pad with zeros\n\nIf you are comfortable with the command line, you may find it easier to resort to calling out to a shell script for the conversion.\n", "Q: Where to find shutdown causes errors list?

The patch allows you to install Yosemite to a disk with a pure MBR partition table and not the default GUID partition table with a pMBR or hybrid MBR (if Windows is installed).\nDepending on the efforts needed to save your data, you may either backup everything, reinstall first Yosemite (or El Capitan) from scratch after partitioning the main disk with a GUID partition table and migrate your data from the backup and then install Windows with Boot Camp Assistant or create a GUID partition table with proper partition values manually after booting to Internet Recovery Mode. The latter will probably render Windows unbootable.\nSince the first method is trivial I only describe the second one.\nAdd a GUID partition table manually:\nThis method will probably render Windows unbootable!\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data - especially any data on your Windows partition.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite).\nAdding GUID partition table and the already existing MBR partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Enter diskutil list to get an overview\n\n*Unmount your main disk with diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 (assumimg disk0 is the disk identifier of your main disk).\n\n*Add an GUID partition table with gpt create /dev/disk0\n\n*Add the EFI and the existent \"MBR partitions\":\nThe command basically looks like this:\ngpt add -b StartBlock -i IndexNumber -s NumberOfBlocks -t Type device\n\nTo add all your partitions enter with the data found in your fdisk list:\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 400094952 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 400504592 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 401785650 -i 4 -s 67071375 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 /dev/disk0\n\nThe size of the last partition (your Windows partition) is odd because usually it's a multiple of 8.

There is zero interaction with Windows or Android.  \n\nA: Take a look here. I use Documents (by Readdle) that works fine and it's free. \nYou can get files from your computer, sync with Dropbox, iCloud, other cloud services and any source you can imagine. You can also download files from the Web using built-in browser. Organize the files into folders for your convenience using the brand new file manager. \nYou can manage different file formats and also read and modify PDFs.

I'm considering using FreeNAS to provide Time Machine network shares for Time Machine backups of 5-10 Macbooks.  One thing I like about this approach is that users simply have to join the network (e.g. open my Macbook), and the Time Machine backup will commence.  This is advantageous as there is no drive that the user must remember to plug in.\nThe disadvantage is that users will surely simply close their laptops and leave the network, effectively \"unplugging\" the Time Machine network share.\nGiven that Time Capsule supports this exact use case (wireless Time Machine backups), I'm inclined to think that suddenly leaving the network mid-backup won't be an issue.  It would be nice to have confirmation from the community, though.\nWill this cause problems?  What should I do to make this use case less error-prone?\n\nA: The nature of backups is that you have an hourly window of time to start one, so the majority of the time, the majority of the computers are not mounting the network share. The algorithm itself is solid in my experience. \nIf you are starting the first backup, that can take quite a while to save, but if you corrupt the disk image then, you can nuke it and start over with no loss of data (there weren't any backups to lose).\nThe OS enables journaling so that the worst that happens in practice is the one interval that was in the middle of being changed gets cancelled and cleaned up. I've had very few OS X server backups have issues with network backups, so as long as the software you run on the NAS is equivalent to OS X implementation you should be just fine with your plan. You can also hedge your bets with periodic backups to hard drives. OS X supports multiple time machine destinations as well as ad-hoc adding and removing them to make more point in time ones that you can archive easier than trolling for changes on the NAS.\nSome data points - roughly 100 Mac are backing up to about a dozen Mac Mini over the last 3 years, and the number of trouble tickets to assist with things users can't solve has been 2. One user was able to be guided to mount the backup destination and use Finder to remove the partial backup interval. The other made requested we copy their image to a hard drive from the server so they could get the files they needed. That user used a local HD to do backups in the interim and now backs up to that drive and had us wipe the server side image and is backing up to both destinations with no issues.\nWe don't manage anything or train users to do anything special. Power off, disconnect from network, they just expect Time Machine to run and we train them to check on it two times: a) before making a large change to a document that losing work would mean losing more than 4 hours of work. b) once a month, run a backup manually from the Menu Bar to ensure it completes.\nOn the server side, we have visibility into when backup images are not updating for more than 3 weeks by a script, so you can implement a check on your NAS if you desire to recreate that Server.app functionality. For $20 I'm a big fan of using server.app to handle things, but lots of people like DIY too.\n\nA: After trying WiFi based Time Machine backups on a NAS (MyCloud) and a NAS-like arrangement (USB hard drive plugged into Airport Extreme), I have found no solution where Time Machine 'just works' with disconnected laptops. \nTime Machine works perfectly for desktops, Ethernet attached or otherwise. But when used on a laptop, where the user can interrupt Time Machine, I have found hung, stalled, and corrupt Time Machine images frequently. Typically, Time Machine will report a problem with the backup, and start a new one.\nThe only solution I found was to stop using Time Machine, and instead use a cloud-based backup system that was built assuming this use case was normal. I prefer Crashplan, but there are many others such as Backblaze, etc. My assumption is that Time Machine was built assuming always connected hard drives, and Wifi is not a well supported case. Time Capsule perhaps has some secret sauce, but I have no experience with it.\n", "Q: Any way to 'migrate' a Time Machine external for use with CCC? I have an external which I'm using with Time Machine, and I'd like to 'migrate' it and start using just CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner).\nIs there a good way to essentially mv the contents of LatestTM to the root of the drive, and then have CCC take over from there?\nI'm concerned about permissions and symlinks being handled correctly.\n(It's over 1TB of data so I'd love to avoid re-copying everything.)\n\nA: No, there is no way. Time Machine uses Symbolic links to previous backups when it hasn't changed. You could use some form of ls -H combination with xargs to copy the latest backup some what safely, however, some times those symlinks are broken. \nFurthermore, CCC won't accept that, because it also need to record which files it has copied, so in future it knows which are changed etc. You would be better off using a removing TM completely, format the disk, or create a partition for CCC. Though no point in keeping two backups on one external HDD, as both will be lost if it's destroyed.\nCCC is very fast, it's not as slow as TM, so it shouldn't take long, as long as HDD has USB 3.0 (true, if inside of plug USB is blue). I was in the same place as you, where I didn't want to give up my previous back ups of TM. So ended using both, Time Machine to store all data, and CCC to create a bootable external copy of my disk. CCC only backs up the essentials, while TM does everything. When my PC's SDD is no longer functioning, I can boot up from CCC, and use TM to retrieve required data on the bootable. \n", "Q: White backgrounds on iPhone showing inset, very light, yet visible pink rectangular area Working on an iPhone app I noticed a very light, yet quite noticeable pink-ish rectangular area that's inset from the screen's edges uniformly by about 4 millimeters (0.16 inches) in all views with a white (light?) background. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out which of my app's view layers might cause this, I discovered that other apps such as WhatsApp, Messenger etc. show the same phenomenon on any white background. Not surprising then, a screenshot captured just shows a plain white background.\nI wonder what this is? A normal effect of the background lighting? A weird setting I have overlooked? A defect?\nI'm fine with the effect, as I don't seem to be causing it in my app, but still curious what it is that has caused me to waste quite a bit of time.\n\nA: This seems to be an issue on a lot of iPhone 5/5s models.

Example:\n\nBut before I started typing, I could see dozens of contacts with last names starting with \"A\". This is a new problem; everything was working until a week or so ago, when I first noticed this issue.\nNote: this is not the same as the many questions about Spotlight search not finding contacts, such as this one. Spotlight actually does find my contacts. So do the Messages app and the \"Invitees\" pane in the Calendar app. The Contacts and Phone apps, however, do not.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I figured this out. Somehow, I had two different contact cards marked as \"my\" card: one named \"Ed Cottrell\" and one named \"Edward Cottrell.\" I have no idea how both of them got marked as \"my\" card; I don't even know where the second one came from. On my phone, only one of them showed up. In the Contacts app on my Macbook, both of them appeared. Anyway, this gave me an idea that this might be the source of the problem.\nI took the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete one of \"my\" cards on the Macbook.\n\n*Exit the Contacts app on my iPhone (fully, as in double-pressing the home button and dragging the app upward).\n\n*Relaunch the Contacts app on my iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*At this point, the \"Groups\" label appeared in the upper left corner of the Contacts app. I had been seeing a circular \"reload\" arrow, but no \"Groups\" label.\n\n\n*Tap on the \"Groups\" label.\n\n*Uncheck all groups.\n\n*Tap \"Done.\"\n\n*Tap on the \"Groups\" label.\n\n*Check all groups.\n\n*Tap \"Done.\"\n\n\nAnd now, my contacts search works again. This was a pain, but at least it's fixed.\n\nA: My assumption is that contacts searching is made possible with a search index. What you describe makes it sound like the search index is corrupt or missing. If my assumption is correct, it's an internal detail that's not accessible or controllable by you. As Spotlight searching for contacts continues to work, this suggests that Spotlight uses a separate search index.\nOne thing you might try is adding a new contact on the phone. Doing this should cause the Contacts app to update its search index, and in this process, it may rebuild the whole thing.\nIf that fails, taking your phone to a Genius Bar at an Apple Store may result in a simple solution that they can perform for you on the spot.\nFailing that, a drastic corrective measure may be to perform a device restore. This is a lengthy process and carries risk of data loss, so please only consider this as a last resort.\n", "Q: How to provide a default value to the \"Ask For Text\" automator function?

As to partitioning/formatting, if the target OS is Windows then I'd partition/format it under Windows.\n\nA: Regarding your first question:\nNo it doesn't matter from which OS you're formatting the drive to a specific file system. File systems are standardized and any reliable OS should do the job well.\nThe OS just need to support the file system.\nThat said - question number two:\nWindows requires NTFS which is not fully supported under OSX (in fact you're only able to read from NTFS, but can't write any data on it).\nSo you won't be able to format the disk on OSX for Windows without any third party software, adding the appropriate support for NTFS (I've been used to had that software, since I had to deal with both OS.

There are a couple of 3rd party brands that positively will work  but I wouldn't trust just any off brand adapter and if its a PC manufacturer brand, then it definitely won't have the internal circuitry that a Mac-compatible adapter will have so the answer, unfortunately is just... no.\nSee: [Do I have to use the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter for a MacBook Air? for further details on adapters that definitely are compatible.\n\nA: A proper instruction for RD9700 is here https://www.technouz.com/3973/how-to-use-a-generic-usb-ethernet-adapter-rd9700-on-mac-os-x/\nThis is the only manual I've found so far that has ALL necessary steps.\nIn particular step 7 is critical (install drivers from x86_64 folder).\nI managed to get my noname adapter working, but the internet speed is only 5mbps although I have 100mbps connection :(\n\nStep 1: Unplug your USB adapter.\nStep 2: Restart your Mac by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left\n  corner and then Restart. As soon as your machine restarts, you’ll hear\n  the Apple chime. Hold down CMD + R immediately after hearing the chime\n  to boot in to Recovery Mode.\nYou can release CMD + R once you see the Apple logo and a progress\n  bar.\nStep 3: From the top bar, select Utilities and then Terminal.\nStep 4: In the terminal window, you need to type the follow and then\n  hit enter: csrutil disable. You may be prompted for your Administrator\n  password.\nStep 5: Now from the top bar, click the Apple Logo and then Restart.\nStep 6: Your Mac should now restart back in to the normal operating\n  mode. It’s time to install the drivers. Click here to download the zip\n  file and extract it to your Desktop.\nStep 7: Install the RD9700 driver located in the x86_64 folder and\n  then restart your Mac again.\nStep 8: Once your Mac has rebooted, open Terminal and enter the\n  following then press the Enter key: sudo kextload\n  /System/Library/Extensions/USBCDEthernet.kext.\nStep 9: Reboot again.\nStep 10: Now plug-in your USB Ethernet Adapter with a live ethernet\n  cable. Open System Preferences and go to Network.\nStep 11: Press the + button in the bottom right and select USB 2.0\n  10/100M Ethernet Adapter and then click Add.\nStep 12: Disconnect from WiFi and you should notice your network\n  connect still works through the RD9700 Ethernet Adapter. In addition,\n  you will be able to share internet using the RD9700 too.\n\n\nA: For Realtek based USB 2.0 or 3.0 Ethernet Adapters, you can get the driver from Realtek which works for both 8153 and 8152.\n\nA: As far as I understand, you can run a lot of generic ones that don't have Apple-signed drivers by disabling \"System Integrity Protection\" (SIP) \nFrom: \nhttp://inkandfeet.com/how-to-use-a-generic-usb-20-10100m-ethernet-adaptor-rd9700-on-mac-os-1011-el-capitan\n\nSteps to get your adapter working if you've never used the adapter before in Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Uninstall the dozens of other drivers you may have installed in the process of trying to get this working.\n  \n*Unplug your USB adapter, and reboot and give yourself a clean slate.\n  \n*Reboot.

It looks pretty fuzzy on retina displays:\nhttp://mapleapp.info\nI've been capturing this video with QuickTime, but i can only export up to 1920x1080. All I need to do is export at a higher quality in order for it to look OK. I've found some third party solutions, but anything I've found that's capable of exporting video at higher than 1080 also comes with a hefty price tag (> $20). Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for paying for apps, but this is something that I'm going to use very rarely and I just can't justify paying that much for something that I'll only use on occasion.\nDoes anybody know of a way to screen record on a Mac and export at higher than 1080 quality? Preferably I'd like built in or free solutions, but I would be willing to pay for an app if it were less than $10. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!\n\nA: A quick Google search found one of my favorite tips for OS X: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20131030130206132\nEssentially, go to System Preferences > Displays, option-click the Scaled button, then select a  new resolution. Your QuickTime movie should record at the new resolution, but remember bigger resolutions take up more graphics power.\n\nA: Turns out that the highest quality that I could export at using Quicktime was 1920 x 1080, however by saving it instead of exporting, I was able to achieve 2880 width. I then converted the video using ffmpeg with:\nffmpeg -i demo-video.mov demo-video.mp4\n\nAnd I had a web ready video at 2880 width!\n", "Q: How to download the SMS messages in my iPhone to a Windows Machine? What is the way to download the SMS messages from my iPhone to a Windows machine? Is there some apple cloud service that I can access for SMS messages?\n\nA: SMS is a strictly cellular service, meaning all text messages use cellular connection. There is no way to access your text messages from the Internet(or by any other means that does not use the phone where he text messages are located). If you could clarify what purpose you need these messages, we could help find a solution. \nEDIT:\nAfter clarification, it seems you would like the raw text content. If you have a Macintosh computer running OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\" or higher and your iPhone is running iOS 8 or higher, you can use continuity to sync all SMS messages with your computer, then allowing you to manually copy/paste all of the content.\nFor a guide on how to set this up, see Apple's guide on Continuity\n", "Q: X11 Mouse Acceleration setting X11 that I am using (XQuartz 2.7.5 (xorg-server 1.14.4)) with Yosemite has very high acceleration with the mouse (external or trackpad).

It's almost like I can create my own instant personal audiobooks anytime I like. The problem is; the default voices, and more specifically, the robotic speech patterns, can get become quite unbearable to listen to. Is there a solution or an alternative available to overcome this problem? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Optional Voices in OS X\nOS X includes support for numerous languages, take a look at the Other Languages section of Speaking with a French accent – OS X say.

The procedure is then traditionally something like\n\n\n*\n\n*./configure, which tailors the sources for the features of the machine it is run on,\n\n*make, which actually compiles the shared libs, executables, etc.,\n\n*make check, which runs the tests before we install the package,\n\n*make install, if the package behaves properly, and finally, optionally,\n\n*make installcheck, to make sure the installation works.\n\n\nDuring make, the shared libs and executables are compiled in their final form: the executables are compiled with a dependency to the shared libs in their final destination (i.e., they depend on libraries in /usr/local/lib although they are not there yet, they are still in the build tree).  Then make install is, roughly, just using cp to install libs and executables from the build tree to the final place.\nDuring the make check phase, we are running the program uninstalled: the shared libs, executables and auxiliary files are still in the build tree.  To run the tests you have to set up a few custom environment variables (for instance to tell your program that your auxiliary data files are not in /usr/local/share but in the source tree), and some system environment variables, to tell your share lib loader to look for the shared libs.  The environment variables on traditional Unices is LD_LIBRARY_PATH, on OS X it is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This has worked for (dozens of) years.\nBut now, El Capitan broke this.\n$ (export FOO=foo; env) | grep foo\nFOO=foo\n$ (export DYLDFOO=foo; env) | grep foo\nDYLDFOO=foo\n$ (export DYLD_FOO=foo; env) | grep foo\n$\n\nnow, when SIP is enabled, no DYLD_* is exported from a process to its children.\nSo my question is: How can we run programs that are not installed?  What is the procedure to follow to be able to run the traditional Unix sequence ./configure && make && make check?\nPlease, no answer such as \"run make install first\".  That's not the point.  I am a developper, and running \"make check\" (and more generally running a non-installed version of a program) is something I do very frequently.  Even installing to a dummy place is time consuming.  I need something effective, and efficient.  And disabling SIP will not fix the issue for users of my packages that want to run make check.\n\nA: It seems like DYLD_* only gets stripped out for “protected” binaries (I’m not sure exactly what that means, but apparently anything in /bin and /usr/bin for starters) However, if you copy /usr/bin/env to somewhere else, it gets to keep its DYLD_* stuff:\n$ cp /usr/bin/env ~/Desktop; (DYLD_FOO=bar ~/Desktop/env)|grep DY\ndyld: warning, unknown environment variable: DYLD_FOO\nDYLD_FOO=bar\n\nI think make always runs commands via /bin/sh, so you can’t set “dangerous” variables in the makefile and have them affect the commands, but maybe you could move the test into a shell script, set the environment variables inside the script, and then invoke the script from make. Though obviously, this won’t help you if the tests, in turn, rely on shell scripts (or if the things tested are shell scripts!) because then they’re going to invoke /bin/sh and lose the variables again...\n", "Q: Browsing IPv6 only I would like to check some websites by using IPv6 only: not only connecting with an IPv6 address but also checking that every other following connection (e.g., for embedded content with iframes) is performed with IPv6.\nIs there a browser where I can disable IPv4? Or a proxy I can install?\n\nA: You can disable IPv4 in your OS and adding some public DNS64/NAT64-Resolver.\nYou can create your own IPv6-only-environment:\nApple has prepared such an environment for testing purposes.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010220-CH213-SW1\n\nA: You can turn IPv4 off in Setting -> Network -> Advanced -> TCP/IP -> Configure IPv4 -> Off.\n\nA: Use Firefox Browser! It can be input ipv6 address on URL blank. If you have bookmark made by IPv6 address, Firefox Browser will work on IPv6 address.\n", "Q: iTunes Still Charging per Track While Subscribed to Apple Music I'm an Apple Music subscriber but I clicked an iTunes link from a website and now all albums have prices. My Apple Music subscription is active, I can stream all my Apple Music playlists and my phone works as expected, but iTunes is acting as though I am not subscribed.\nIn preferences Apple Music is selected:\n\nHowever in iTunes I have a Store link and prices:\n\nHow do I get to the Apple Music subscription I'm paying for?\n\nA: The prices are shown because you are in the iTunes Store tab. You can still buy tracks and albums there, like before. To get to Apple Music, click \"My Music\", \"For you\" or \"New\" in the top bar.\n\"My music\" is where your music is, both the tracks and albums you've previously purchased and the ones you've saved in Apple Music. \"For you\" is personalized suggestions, and \"New\" is well, new music.\nWhen you do a search from any of those tabs you can also choose to search Apple Music instead of just your own library.\n", "Q: Mac storage usage I have a mid 2014 macbook pro, with just 128gb of storage. So as you can imagine, space is at a premium. When i've left it on for a day or so I notice my remaining space goes down. Is this some sort of caching or system restore or something that's eating up all my usable remaining space? I have about 5gb free, but the end of the day it's normally full. Is this normal? Or is something leaking\nAll I do to clear it is reboot. The following screenshot is after and before a reboot\n\n\nA: When my Mac was almost full it used to do that. Usually 2 or 3 GB, i believe that is really a kind of cache.\nI upgraded my storage with a SD adapter and it stopped to happen.\nMine is from TheMiniDrive, now i have more 256GB hehehe\n", "Q: Automator workflow only works when clicking \"step\" I am trying to write a workflow that will use Shell to apply SHA256 to cells in an Excel spreadsheet. \nThe Workflow (which may be a bit of a hack) is working, but only when I click through it using \"Step\" - if I try to Run it or Loop it, the output is not the SHA256 hash but the original input.  \nAny ideas? As this seems really weird.\nEDIT: Thanks to @Graham Miln I eventually got this working in AppleScript alone without Automator. \n\n\n\nA: The behaviour you describe suggests a timing issue. One or more steps are not completing before the next step begins.\nConsider combining all the steps into a single AppleScript. You can use the do shell script command in AppleScript to call out to shasum:\n-- Get value to hash from clipboard\nset myValue to the clipboard\n\n-- Build the command to execute\nset hashCommand to \"echo -n \" & quoted form of (myValue) & \" | shasum -a 256\"\n\n-- Debug check the command; comment out when it looks good\ndisplay dialog hashCommand\n\n-- Execute command and place on clipboard\nset myHash to do shell script hashCommand\nset the clipboard to myHash\n\nThe clipboard is accessible by AppleScript:\ndisplay dialog (the clipboard)\n\nAs a single AppleScript, you can debug using Applications > Utilities > Script Editor and gain much better insight into what is happening as the script runs.\n", "Q: How to map CAPS LOCK key in Vim? This question has already been asked here. The accepted answer says it is not possible. Other answers provide a way to do it on linux but I have not check if it worked. I am most interested in knowing if there is a way to do it for mac (although you can post answers for linux as well). \nI am only reposting this question here because the other question on SOF is more than five years old. Ideally, I would like to remap to <ESC> key to CAPS LOCK.\n\nA: If you are using the X11 environment, you may achieve what you want\nwith the following commands:\nxmodmap -e 'clear lock'\n\nwhich means: from now on, Caps_Lock key isn't anymore a keyboard modifier\nand fall back to a normal key\nxmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Escape'\n\nwhich means: get the keycode of Caps_Lock and from now on assign it the\nkeysym of Escape.\nNote: this receipe works on any Unix.\n\nA: The question you posted is still up to date. I've been using the AutoHotkey solution under windows for some years and I'm quite happy with it. I find it useful to also remap the Capslock to Esc under Firefox+Pentadactyl.\nAs there is no AutoHotkey for mac, you should look for its alternatives.\n\nA: Steve Losh describes a Mac specific way in his blog on the crafting a modern Space Cadet.

The battery is 100% charged, It boots only when I connect the charger and takes 3-4 minutes charge before it starts booting.\nI used a compatible charger for a couple of months which caused this issue perhaps.\n\nA: Click on Apple icon in top left and go to: About This Mac -> System Report -> Power and see the battery condition. If battery is Normal, check if your computer is actually sleeping after you close the lid.\nReset your SMC and PRAM.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\nTo make sure it is not a software problem, I would boot from an external USB with a clean OS installed on it. And test it with that.\nIf all these steps fail, I would brought it to Apple store so they would run some hardware diagnostics (it's free, just make an appointment at Genius Bar).\nHopefully SMC would fix it. If not, it sounds like a battery issue. That 'compatible' charger, was it Apple's? Some cheap replicas from eBay are not good. I hope it is not a logic board's power distribution failure which is still fixable, but it's more of a chipset problem then. A chip would have to be replaced/reprogrammed. At Apple, they change the whole board, not just a chip, so wait on fixing it with them (unless you still have Apple Care) and check local and online logic board repair stores.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: I had this exact same problem.

Am I able to have the latest version of Safari without having the latest version of OS x? Or is that only possible when you update to the latest version of the OS X?\n\nA: As discussed here, you can try with the following commands in Terminal:\nFrom Mavericks: \nsoftwareupdate -i Safari9.0Mavericks-9.0 \n\nFrom Yosemite:\nsoftwareupdate -i Safari9.0Yosemite-9.0\n\n\nA: For the most part, no, the versions are not tied to OSX releases. You can be on 10.10 and still get the minor Safari updates, but (for example) when OSX 10.11 came out a new major version of Safari was released with it, and that was tied to the 10.11 update, so they will on occasion release a Safari version tied to a specific OS version.\n", "Q: Is it 'safe' to use FN for custom shortcuts I'd like to create my own shortcut combinations, and it looks to me that the fn key is actually only used for a few shortcuts on OS X. For example, fn-delete is forward delete. In applications like Photoshop it's not used.\nAre you aware of any applications that uses fn shortcuts? I don't want to create potential conflicts. If feels strange to think that no software is using such a simple key, and they go for the more complex option-command-shift combinations instead.\nJust to be clear, I'm referring to the use of the fn key (eg. the one usually on the lower left side of a MacBook Air's keyboard), not to the function keys (F1 to F19) found at the top of the keyboard.\n\nA: You cannot create shortcuts using the fn key in the preferences pane (but you can assign Function keys f1, f2 etc.) \nThe shortcuts interface will allow you to press fn + X for Cut etc, but only X is displayed as the shortcut, and pressing fn + X results in typing X not cutting.\nVery annoying for people that switch between Windows and Mac keyboards, since the CTRL key on a Windows keyboard is where the fn key is on a Mac keyboads.\n\nA: For the most part, function keys are only used by OSX and not third-party programs, but some programs use the F1 key for accessing the help menu. Also if you are into games, some games like Just Cause 2 might have some conflicts with it, as (I believe) the F1 and F2 keys are used for opening in-game map etc.\nAlso forgot to mention, if you have dictation enabled you might want to disable the \"FN double-tap\" activation shortcut... Goes without saying. Too many times have I accidentally hit the FN key twice, and creating custom shorcuts with it will make you more prone to accidentally activating dictation.\n", "Q: External hdd: Difference \"Get Info\" Available space and \"About This Mac - Storage OS X El Capitan.\nI have seen this thread, and it explains a bit (different reporting units), but there is an additional substantial discrepancy in the free HDD space of an external HD reported:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Info : 11.22GB\n\n*df -h    : 1.3Gi\n\n*About This Mac - Storage : 1.42 GB\n\n\n\nSo the differences between About This Mac and df -h can be according to the different units - but the Get Info is heavily off? \nAny ideas what is going on there? \nI know for a fact that the df -h and About This Mac are correct as I can not copy anything larger than the 1.4 Gb on the disk.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\nThese are the hidden files and folders - the rest is stuff I put there:\n$ ls -la\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 rainerkrug  staff       14340 Nov 10 14:51 .DS_Store\ndrwx------   5 root        staff         170 Nov 10 18:19 .Spotlight-V100\nd-wx-wx-wt   2 root        staff          68 Nov 10 17:36 .Trashes\n-rwxr-xr-x@  1 rainerkrug  staff         313 Mar 15  2015 .apdisk\ndrwx------  15 root        staff         510 Nov 10 18:24 .fseventsd\n\nand their disk usage:\n$ sudo du -sch .[!.]* *\n 16K    .DS_Store\n 11M    .Spotlight-V100\n  0B    .Trashes\n4.0K    .apdisk\n 52K    .fseventsd\n\n\nA: You could try sudo mdutil -E / on the terminal, to reindex Spotlight.\n\nA: The problem is that Finder ignores all space taken up by backups.

So Safari will always add *.dev to HSTS list...\nSeems many developers will need to change .dev suffix to another one :(\nSee: Chrome to force .dev domains to HTTPS via preloaded HSTS\n\nA: It seems Safari enters into this mad behaviour when you have accessed localhost using a client side certificate. In my case, one of the projects I work with needs this client side setup and it totally wrecks development for the projects where I can't use http on localhost. The only workaround I have found is to edit /etc/hosts and add an alias for localhost, like so\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n\nThen use I can use http://localhost:3000 to access my project on port 3000 without Safari forcing a https connection.\n\nA: I also encountered this 'Safari HSTS Cache' problem.\nI tried the solution rm ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist, but it does not work.\nBut the following steps are useful:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*rm -f ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist, remove HSTS cache file\n\n*killall nsurlstoraged, to stop HTTP storage manager (because it has an in-memory cache of the HSTS hosts)\n\nThe most important is, service nsurlstoraged has a in-memory HSTS cache, must reload this service.\n", "Q: MBP - have to re-enable Wi-Fi every 30 mins I have a MacBook Pro running on El Capitan (but the issue was already present before the upgrade, so it's not related). I have the Mac since a bit less than a year.\nIt is still running perfectly but since a couple of weeks, the internet is really weird. It's constantly completely blocked and just not working.\nThe wifi works well: on my iPhone it is never down, but every 30min or so, it just blocks while I am browsing (but the issue is there on all the apps used, from Xcode to my FTP client, and so on), and it doesn't work anymore.\nWhen I just turn the wifi off and on again, it works well for some time, and then the issue comes back again.\nI tried changing the DNS (by using this software that indicates the fastest DNS to use) and I thought it worked at first, but the issues are back again.\nI have tried deleting the wifi from my keychain and adding it again the problem is persisting.\nObviously I have restarted the modem a couple of times too, no difference.\nAny advice?\n\nA: You can run a Cron action who turn on/off your wifi connection every 30 minutes ;)\nTurn Wifi Off\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\n\nTurn Wifi On\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nhttp://blog.mattcrampton.com/post/64144666914/managing-wifi-connections-using-the-mac-osx\nSchedule a Cron task :\nhttp://benr75.com/pages/using_crontab_mac_os_x_unix_linux\nEdit : Ohh sorry I was thinking that you wanted to turn on/off your wifi every 30 minutes :/ However, if you don't find a solution...\n", "Q: Incorrect synchronized time – how do iPhones know what time is it? This year my country decided we no longer needed summer saving time, and since the date when time was supposed to change to summer time, my iPhone has had the wrong time.\nI have an iPhone 4. I believe newer phones don't have this problem.\nMy phone thinks it is summer time and is 1 hour off if I set it to synchronize automatically. I resorted to somewhat convoluted tricks to keep it synchronized correctly. If I fixed the offset time manually, Whatsapp went wrong.\nHow is it possible? What does it do when I set the time to synchronize automatically? I previously thought it synchornized with the phone service provider but it appears to not be the case.\n\nA: The phone receives the current time in UTC from the carrier (or from NTP server) and applies current timezone adjustment based on your settings. I assume that the timezone data in your phone is probably outdated and reflects the old rules of applying DST, that's why you have 1 hour difference.\n", "Q: Is it safe to run two installers simultaneously? Is it safe to run two installers simultaneously? Or is it safer to run one by one(maybe installers changes to write on same file)?\n\nA: Installer won't let you install two programs simultaneously, so the question is moot. Click Install on as many packages as you wish and Installer.app will queue them up and install them individually.\n                       \n", "Q: Does Deepsleep (Standby mode) resets uptime? Recently, I noticed that my MacBook Pro retina 15\" 2015 mid takes a quite long time to wake up from sleep.\nToday, I realized that my machine didn't wake up but actually boots up. How did I know that? I've just typed uptime command from a Terminal.app right after the screen shows up.\nIt says, for example,\n\n1:25 up 3 mins, ...\n\nThat means, my machine has been running for only 3 minutes and it does not take time before sleep into account.\nThen, only one explanation is possible. My machine has been shut down between sleep and wake. And I misunderstood its new boot as wake up\nAnother rationale is, Deepsleep (Standby mode) resets uptime counter. Huh...\nWhich do you think more legit?\n\nA: Your Mac is effectively shut down during the deeper sleep modes. The system state is stored as a file and then the Mac is shut down. On powering back on, the system state is restored from the file.\nIt is this behaviour that is most likely resetting your uptime results. At the lower UNIX level, most tools will treat the interval as time where your Mac was powered off.\nYou can learn more about the various sleep states in Apple's OS X: Saving energy with Sleep. Deep sleep is mentioned in the Standby Mode section:\n\nStandby Mode\nFor Mac computers that are started from an solid-state drive, OS X includes a deep sleep mode known as Standby Mode. Mac computers manufactured in 2013 or later enter standby after one to three hours of regular sleep. A computer with a fully charged battery can remain in standby for up to thirty days without being plugged in to an AC power source.\n\n", "Q: Which Bluetooth Headphones Switch Easily between 3 Devices? I am planning on buying bluetooth headphones that I would use alternatively with my iPad, iPhone and MacBook Pro. I saw the bose headphones allow to have 2 devices connected at the same time and that it is easy to switch from one to the other but it's only with two.\nWhich Bluetooth Headphones are able to switch easily between 3 different devices?\n\nA: Unfortunately Bluetooth Multipoint only allows two devices to be connected at the same time.\nThere are some business headsets that can connect to three devices at once, but they cheat - they use Bluetooth multipoint to the phone and ipad and use DECT to connect to a base station on your desk. The base station can connect to the macbook with a USB cable. \n\nA: AirPods!\n\n\n*\n\n*You can switch devices easily\n\n\n*\n\n*Airplay in apps that support it\n\n*iPhone Control Center: Swipe Up, Swipe Right to Left, select AirPods in Airplay on bottom\n\n*iPhone Bluetooth: Force Touch \"Settings\", select Bluetooth, connect\n\n*Mac Bluetooth in Menu Bar (if not there, go to System Preferences → Bluetooth → \"Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar\"\n\n*Mac Sound in Menu Bar (System Preferences → Sound → \"Show Volume in Menu Bar\")\n\n\n*AirPods auto-pair to devices signed into the same Apple ID (no need to pair via Bluetooth). It connects to the last connected device automatically.\n\n*Sound quality/fit are essentially identical to traditional Earpods, but Airpods are truly wireless!\n\n\nA: I found yesterday that Bose qc35 series 2 has easy switching mode between all previously connected devices at easy of single move.\nI found the related help page here.\nBad side is this, it's a very big headphone for me to constantly use. \n", "Q: iOS 9.1 ipad cannot connect to the App Store I just upgraded my original iPad to iOS 9.1 and it now cannot connect to the App Store. No other error is given. If I go to the App Store I get a blank page. If I try to Update an app, the screen spins for a long time and eventually gives a pop up message reading \"Unable to Connect to the App Store\". The connectivity of the iPad is fine and I can use other networked applications such as Safari with no problem. It is only the App Store that is not working.\nHow can I diagnose the cause of this problem?\nUpdate: I signed out of the App Store by going to Settings / iTunes & App Sotre / Signout. Now, when I try to sign in, the machine hangs for about two minutes and then presents a message box that says: \"Cannot connect to the iTunes Store\".\n\nA: I went to a Genius Bar to fix this.\nThe genius said that I needed to reinstall 9.1. He said that sometimes when 9.1 is installed something gets messed up, so it needs to be installed TWICE.\nUnfortunately, you can only do this from a PC or Mac desktop computer, because iOS on the iPad does not give any option to re-install an operating system you already have.\nAfter re-installing 9.1 the App Store did indeed work on my iPad.\nNote that this machine is an original iPad.\n\nAlso, another important note is that the App Store can get munged if it is accessed from a blocked network. If you trying to use the App Store from a place where there is a firewall or advanced packet filtering, like a company network, then the App Store can get blocked and this will mess it up because it will timeout and then not attempt to connect again. The App Store uses many different ports and if any of these are blocked by a firewall, it can get messed up.\nTo fix this:\n(1) get a clean, unblocked, unfiltered connection\n(2) close any open instance of the App Store by using a 4-finger swipe up\n(3) start App Store again\n", "Q: How do I calibrate an Apple TV Display? I am familiar with using the Display Calibration Assistant.  I have used it on other external monitors before.  Connected to my living room TV via AirPlay using Apple TV.  The colors are all off.  When I open the displays menu, I am able to open the calibration assistant for the built in display, but not my external Apple TV display.  I can see other profiles for other external monitors, but I cannot select them.\n\n\nA: I use the THX tune up app on iOS to calibrate my AppleTV over airplay. I've not found a way to get OS X to calibrate things further, but to my eyes, this workaround has been good enough with default settings on OS X.\n\nA: I use the Calibr8 app for tvOS, which comes with guided instructions and HD.709 professional-grade test patterns.\nNB It's not possible to apply colour profile to the device, so you'll need to tweak the settings on your TV to apply any changes.\n\nA: I like HD Test Patterns for its simplicity and good instructions.\n", "Q: find my iphone application My find my iphone was being used, not by myself. It could be my ex. Is there a way to see where that person used the find my iphone to figure out where i am? Maybe narrow it down to a certain State that someone had logged into, to use the find my iphone locator\n\nA: Find my iPhone works with iCloud id, as explain here, So if you are using same iCloud ID and she knows the password then she can trace you, Its better to change your iCloud ID or at least change its password.\nOr you can disable the location services to disable tracking by going in Setting > Privacy > Location Services\n", "Q: Prevent OS X from powering off, via CLI I use maid to run a few maintenance scripts regularly, via launchd. The time I chose for those tasks to run makes it very likely that I won’t suddenly decide to turn off my computer around then, but one can never be absolutely certain.\nSometimes, GUI apps prevent the computer from turning off due to unsaved changes. Can we replicate this via CLI? A bit like caffeinate but for power off instead of sleep.\n\nA: How about actually using a GUI app to make an unsaved document?\nosascript -e '\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        activate\n        set d to (make document)\n        set text of d to \"Your script is still running!\"\n    end tell\n'\n\n\nA: the built in pmset utility can do this\nsudo pmset autopoweroff 0\nsudo pmset disksleep 0\n\nShould work.

It only shows a black display and doesn't respond to any action. Thanks to the power button I can only turn it off. \n\n*Turning on the mac requires me 20 minutes of trial and error. I have to try almost 15 times to boot it. It gets stuck on a progress bar screen which doesn't go further than 50%. Sometimes the progress bar is gone and a white blank screen appears. I have tried to boot with safe mode and the same thing happens. \n\n\nI am worried that this can be a hardware problem. If that's not the case how can I \"cure\" this strange behaviour. \n\nA: It is likely the issue explained on this page on apple.com. If so, it is a problem with your GPU.\nSymptom wise the \"trial and error\" in trying to start up your computer corresponds to my own experience, which I have also seen online. I personally also didn't see any actual graphics glitches before experiencing my first trouble startup up my computer. Only when my computer was already in a pretty bad state, did I see them.\nI am quite sure I have this issue on my other computer, because using a third party program gfxCardStatus I was able to avoid crashes when I switched to \"Integrated Only\", which is the internal GPU. That avoids using the GPU that has the problem.\nNote that you may have to act quickly to get reimbursed for a repair.

What hardware do I need to hook it up through USB and should read privileges be enough to copy from drive to else where?\n\nA: You need a SATA to USB connector kit or 2.5\" SATA External USB Enclosure, either will do.

I have a folder containing several alias for pdf's that each have > 200 mb. Each pdf is in a different location on my drive.\nI need to compress all of those files. \nWhat is the fastest way to do it? \nThere is always the slow way of going to each of the alias, right clicking it, copying the original to a predefined folder, repeat this procedure for every alias and finally compress the folder with all the original pdfs\nEvidently this will take forever! Is there a fastest way? For example using Terminal.\nRelated, Is it possible to copy the original file of an alias using keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: Smart Folders are a great way to accomplish your desired result of gathering the files.  No matter where the file is on your drive, all can be selected then compressed.\n\nCreate a Smart Folder In the Finder, choose File > New Smart Folder, or press options+⌘+N.\nTo search for files, enter a topic, a phrase, or another parameter in\nthe search field.\nTo determine whether the search should include only the names of files\nor their entire contents, choose “Name matches” in the menu that\nappears below the search field, then click Name, then choose\neither Filename or Everything.\nTo search for additional specific attributes, click the Add button\n(+) below the search field, then make choices using the search\nattribute pop-up menus that appear.\nThe menus work in pairs; for example, to search for images, you choose\nKind from the pop-up menu on the left, then choose Images from the\npop-up menu next to it.\nClick Save, then specify a name and location for your Smart\nFolder.\nIf you don’t want your Smart Folder to be in the sidebar, deselect Add\nTo Sidebar.\nYou can’t use certain characters, including punctuation such as a\ncolon (:), in folder names. If an error message appears, try using\nanother name. You can then save the folder for future use.\n\nWhen you are satisfied that you have the files you need, select them and then compress.\n\n\nA: There is a free app called AliasHerder whose only purpose is to do exactly this. You can get it here. Although the app is deprecated it works just fine on my system (10.10.1). You simple drag the folder with the aliases onto the app and it replaces all aliases with the original files.\n\nA: If you aren't scared of bash scripting, one possibility might be to use getTrueName.c. There are a number of ways you could go about it that I can think of, but here's one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the getTrueName script somewhere.\n\n*Run getTrueName on all the files in the directory with your aliases.\n\n*Iterate cp over that list and the path to a new directory that you want to copy them all to.\n\n*Compress that folder.\n\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions, let me know and I'll edit my answer.\n\nA: All you should have to do is copy the aliases to a different folder with 'cp', then compress them as normal. By copying the alias, the terminal will by default copy the original file, rather than the alias shortcut itself.\nOf course, you'll still have to specify the path to the alias file in each 'cp' command, if they are in different folders; but, I think this is about as fast as you could most easily do it.\n", "Q: How to recover files from command \"git clean -df\" I accidentally run the command \"git clean -df\", so I lost many directories and files, I want to recover them, I don't have backup in time machine. I tried some software to recover, but they don't work.\n\nA: If you are working with an online repository and you keep it up-to-date you can download all the file from the online repository using the following commands:\ngit pull                            # in the case the remote is set\ngit clone <address_of_repository>   # in the case the remote is not set\n\nUsing these commands you'll be able to restore your deleted files, obviously only if the online repository is up to date.   \n\nA: I also ran into same issue unknowingly ran git clean -df and git clean -xf, but fortunately I am using php storm and it saves local history by which I am able to recover the deleted files.\nIf you are also using any IDE then check if it has local history.\n", "Q: How do I copy all photos from Photos App to an external drive?

I have a Mid 2012 13 inch MacBook Pro that's been running successfully with a hybrid drive (3rd party) for the last few years.  Recently, the operating system crashed and the hard drive is no longer recognised in recovery mode, so I purchased a 500GB samsung SSD to go into the machine.\nI can successfully install Mountain Lion or El Capitan on the new SSD, but it never boots.  I simply get any of folder with question mark / cancel symbol or flashing between the two when trying to run off that drive.  Here's what I've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in Recovery Mode, format drive as 1 partition (Mac OS journaled and using the Guid Partition Map), and then install OS X.  This works successfully until trying to boot from the SSD.\nBoot in recovery mode and try and restore from time machine backup.  This fails as it cannot create a recovery partition on the drive.\n\n*I've installed Mountain Lion successfully on an external USB drive, and have it up and running, from there, I downloaded the El Capitan installer and installed onto the SSD, which worked fine, but as soon as it came time to boot from the SSD, no dice.\n\n*I've created a USB installer from the El Capitan installer (using createinstallmedia), then used that USB drive to install to the SSD, and it all works to the point of trying to boot from the SSD, and then, no dice.\n\n*Throughout this process, Disk Utility in OS X and OS X recovery can successfully see and partition the SSD, and Verify Disk has never returned any errors, so as far as I can see, it doesn't seem to be hardware issue, but I cannot get OS X to boot from the disk (it boots fine from the USB I installed to).\n\n\nAny ideas?\nUPDATED: Just to clarify, in the Disk Utility in the El Capitan installer, I choose to partition the drive using the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: OS X\n\n*Format: OS X Extended (Journaled)\n\n*Scheme: GUID Partition Map\n\n\nThis works without a problem, and the new partition appears. At this point, I choose \"First Aid\" which completes with no errors.  \"Info\" on the partition created, shows \"writable\" yes, but \"bootable\" no, which I would expect at this point.\nUPDATED: I've successfully installed Ubuntu 15.04 on the hard drive and it's working fine, and then I swapped the 500GB drive with a 240GB Samsung SSD and got exactly the same issue.

Reformatting to GUID didn't help, I had to erase the SSD to ExFAT and MBR to restore it in its original state I guess, then reformat to GUID_partition_scheme and OS X Extended (Journaled), and it worked fine.\n\nA: You didn't mention if prior to formatting the SSD you used Disk Utility to partition it as GUID (from the choices found after clicking the Options button in the Partition Tab). That may be what's preventing it from booting the system. Check that out and make that change if necessary then reinstall your OS and see if it will boot your laptop.\n\nA: Turns out this is symptomatic of a SATA cable issue.  Seems like writing to the drive was fine (hence installing wasn't an issue), but reading from the drive was causing the issue.  Verify and Repair disk in the installer weren't picking up the issue.\nReplacing the SATA cable fixed the problem.\n\nA: Had the same problem. Found the SSD connector not made as thick as HDD connector this causes contact problem. Quick fix is to cut two thin pieces of printer paper to use as shims to wedge the contacts together.

There is a slight possibility that the change was made there, and you can change it manually.\nThe more-likely issue is that the software was not uninstalled completely when removed from your Applications directory.  Lots of software nowadays comes included with uninstallers that you must run to remove stuff that gets distributed all over your filesystem (which is similar, yet not nearly as bad as the whole Windows Registry/AppData situation), yet I see this type of thing becoming more complex with each new version of OS X.\nThere is probably a .plist file out there somewhere that is getting loaded on startup or login that is controlling this unwanted behavior.  Personally, I would go about resolving this in 1 of the following 3 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-download the app, and see if it comes packaged with an uninstaller.  If so, run the uninstaller instead of dragging the app into the Trash.\n\n*If the offending application did not come with its own uninstaller, download and install AppZapper, which is the absolute best uninstaller for OS X that I have come across to date.  If you are familiar with Windows, it is the equivalent of RevoUninstaller for Macs.  You simply open the AppZapper application, then drag the app from /Applications into the AppZapper window.  AppZapper will automatically include all files that got installed elsewhere on your filesystem (such as ~/Library/*/*.plist, etc.) that are related to that application.  Then simply click Zap! in order to remove all traces of its previous existence.  I have absolutely no affiliation with this app, but recommend it often, because it's simply a must-have for me and has saved me much grief in the past.\n\n*You can manually search out the offending .plist file, which is probably somewhere in ~/Library/LaunchAgents or ~/Library/LaunchDaemons, etc.  Sometimes they are hard to find and oddly-named.  First I would do a search for com.[better.touch.something.or.other].plist, but many times they follow the naming convention of the company or developer, which you may also try.\n\n\nIf all else fails, just sudo -s, start at / and start executing find commands (or better yet, in all of your Libraries -- if you are unlike me and remember where all of them are):\n$ sudo -s\n# find / -type f -iname \"*.better*.plist\" 2>/dev/null\n# find / -type f -iname \"*.btt*.plist\" 2>/dev/null\n# find / -type f -iname \"*.boastr*.plist\" 2>/dev/null\n\nor maybe a better/faster way would be...\n# find / -type f -iname \"*Library*.plist\"\n\n...and see if anything stands out.  If so, make a backup just in case you are mistaken, and then delete that sucker:\n# rm [offending file].plist\n\n", "Q: Photos can't be deleted from iPhone There are some photos on my iPhone 6 plus that I want to get rid of but I can't. When I click the photo the trash-can disappears. When I click edit a note pops up saying these photos are not editable. \nHow can I delete them?\n\nA: If the photos were put by syncing with iTunes you can't delete them using iPhone.\nTo delete photos and/or albums that were copied to your iPhone by syncing with your computer are deleted by doing another sync. \n\n\n*\n\n*Start iTunes on the computer and connect your phone.\n\n*Select your phone in iTunes and select the Photos tab. \n\n*Then DESELECT the items you no long want on the Phone. \n\n*Then click on Apply or sync. \n\n\nThe photos or albums will be removed from your iPhone but they will remain on your computer.\n\nA: Yup, if they are on the stream then you can delete it on your phone.

Is there any difference on power charger between iPhone 6 vs 6s?\nI'm worried that there is a difference and that I'll have issues when I use the iPhone 6 charger for iPhone 6s\nIt looks similar but can I get it confirmed?\n\nA: Both use Lightning cable, so we are good there.\nRegarding power, the 12W charger is compatible with all iPhones. See product Compatibility section of 12W charger.\niPhone Models \niPhone  \niPhone 3G  \niPhone 3Gs  \niPhone 4  \niPhone 4s  \niPhone 5  \niPhone 5c  \niPhone 5s  \niPhone 6  \niPhone 6 Plus  \niPhone 6s  \niPhone 6s Plus  \n\nSo you should be confident of charging iPhone 6 or 6s with up to 12W charger. The higher the wattage the lesser is the charging time.\n\nA: You can use iPhone 6 charger for iPhone 6s and vice versa. You can even use your usb port on your Mac/PC to charge them both (however the charging might take a little more time than). There is no issue about that. \n\nA: Yes it's safe to use iPhone 6 charger to iPhone 6s.

I have found no such option on my Macbook (OS X ) and am wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue.\nThe only potential solution I came across was the Battery Tracker on the Mac App Store. It is not clear whether it supports all Bluetooth devices (and not just standard peripherals), and I would rather not pay the $1.99 to find out.\nI know that my headphones have the A2DP Bluetooth profile, so my gut is telling me that information about my battery level has to be accessible somewhere on my computer.\nHere is a screenshot of the device profile from my mac's System Information. RSSI seems like the only thing that could have been a battery meter (everything else is booleans or id's), but from what I've read it seems to be a metric for signal strength.\nI'm interested in finding a solution from a practical standpoint, but am equally as interested in understanding how it would be/is achieved from a technical standpoint.  Think I just need to figure out what the battery metric/param/variable is called, and where I can get it.\nPlease let me know if you have any thoughts/insights ! Thanks\n\nA: The battery indicator for headsets does not appear on the Mac, regardless.\n\nA: I hate to have to answer in the negative but the answer is: you can't.\nOnly apple devices exchange this detail via Bluetooth today.\nThe only vendor I’ve seen that has third party software to expose battery level is Logitech. I can’t recommend the software though as it has more downsides for me than upsides.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/options.html\nI've done a lot of searching the web, testing utilities, playing with ioreg on the commandline, scrutinizing System Profile reports, and it appears to me that OS X has no way of displaying battery level of connected devices that don't automatically display battery status in their Bluetooth menu Device submenu, even if iOS devices display detailed level info for the same Bluetooth device when connected to them. OS X just appears to completely ignore this capability in all but a few default (Apple-manufactured, it appears to me) devices.\n", "Q: Macbook pro stuck on boot - \"AppleUSBHostPort::interruptOccurred: overcurrent detected\" I am trying to reinstall OSX on a MacBook Pro Mid-2009 but it hangs on startup.\nI have used several disks but now when running in verbose mode see that it hangs at \n\"AppleUSBHostPort::interruptOccurred: overcurrent detected\"\nand loops here.\nImage of messages during startup:  \n\n\nA: You have a hardware problem with your USB ports and it's physical. It try to disable de USB ports but they can't so they throw this error.\nIt's hardware related, you can do nothing about.\n\nA: When my MacBook Air dropped to the ground while a USB micro thumb drive was connected, the right-hand side USB connector got damaged. The port stopped working and since then it apparently has a minor short-circuit. In effect the area close to it gets warm and the laptop battery is drained within an hour. A hardware repair would likely require replacing the main logic board since unfortunately this USB connector is part of that board. A replacement part would cost US$ 300 and some 2 hours work for an experienced HW gugy, so I decided that this is not worth it for me.\nI did not encounter any software issues until I upgraded my system from Mac OS X 10.8.6 Mountain Lion to 10.12.6 Sierra. Later I learned that with 10.11 El Capitan the way USB ports are included has changed.\nWhen the system (any Mac OS X 10.11 or later) boots up it takes 2-3 times longer than usual while constantly emitting dmesg messages like the following:\nXHC1@14000000: AppleUSBXHCI::hardwareException: kUSBCommandReset did not clear\nXHC1@14000000: AppleUSBHostController::setPowerStateGated: going to state 2 failed with 0xe00002e9\n\nAfter the fix mentioned below it still occasionally gives the following message, which is bearable and a good indication of the root cause:\nAppleUSBHostPort::interruptOccurred: overcurrent detected with port status 0x4000, localSimulatedInterrupts = 0x0\n\nSince then I've been struggling to find a way of disabling that USB port in a way that system boot is not held up and that the other, left-hand side USB port is still usable (at least in USB 2.0 High Speed mode).

Mail seems to be working okay but none of my signatures are showing up in preferences. I have copied back the folder ~/Library/Mail from backup, which in turn contains V2/MailData/Signatures. In addition to a couple of sig-related preference files, that folder holds a whole load of cryptically-named files, each of which is stored twice -- once with a .mailsignature suffix and once with a .webarchive suffix. \nWhen I launch Mail it seems to delete the .mailsignature files from the folder leaving only the .webarchive files, and as a result I am left with no signatures. Every time I copy the contents of the Signatures folder back from the backup the same thing happens; Mail deletes the .mailsignature files. I can also see that the AllSignatures.plist file gets re-written to empty (the one I'm copying in from backup is not empty). I don't know whether that is a product of the files being deleted, or vice versa.\nExtra info:\nI have iCloud enabled for Mail and my other Macbook Air (also with iCloud enabled for Mail) is showing my signature collection just fine (though I'm a bit worried that iCloud is going to tell the laptop to delete its signatures as well). Certainly iCloud is not pulling signatures over from the laptop, which makes me wonder what else is not being kept in sync. [I just created a Smart Mailbox in Mail on the laptop to see if it appeared on the iMac. It did not. So presumably iCloud is not correctly syncing on Mail, although Safari bookmarks are updating between the two macs]. That doesn't necessarily explain why the Signatures keep being deleted though.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: I have a problem with my signatures too, and perhaps, this may help.\nMy problem was, that on my Mac, my Apple ID (my mail address) was used not only for login but also as mail address and alias for the iCloud mail account.

According to some reports /usr/local/bin is accessible only for sudoers, \"regular\" user can't access it. What should be the right location to install my application, so every user could access it?   \n\nA: For command line tools accessed by any user, /usr/local/bin is the best location.\nSystem Wide Requires Admin\nThat sudo may also be required is also correct. An administrator should be required to make changes that affect other users of a computer. Ideally only users who are administrators can make system wide changes.\nPractically this means your Installer package should require admin rights to be installed. Installer.app will take care of enforcement for you.\npkgbuild\nHopefully you are using pkgbuild to create the Installer package.\nIf so, make sure you pass the destination path /usr/local/bin using the --install-location flag.\nAvoid embedding standard parent folders in your package and installing to /. No package should need to install directly to /.\nThis will ensure any existing /usr/local/bin folder path retains its permissions and your package does not damage any existing settings.

I have Display Port to MiniDisplay Port going from the monitor to the dock, one thunderbolt cable going from dock to Macbook Pro, and one Display Port to MiniDisplay Port going from a second monitor to the MBP.\nEvery so often, the monitor hooked into the dock will simply 'reset' or disconnect and then connect again. Everything I had on that monitor moves to my laptop main display and then the monitor appears again.\nI have checked the lights/connections and there is no poweroff of the dock. Has anyone else experierenced this or know of a solution?\nUPDATE: After switching ports with monitors, the same thing happens with the second monitor in the Dock. It also happens with HDMI to the dock (which is why I went with DisplayPort -> miniDisplayPort in the first place). \n\nA: January 22, 2016: I had similar problem (intermittent monitor and hard disk disconnects) and called the OWC HelpDesk.  The OWC technician said that problem was with the Mac Thunderbolt driver, not the Dock, and the solution is to reset PRAM/NVRAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\nSince PRAM/NVRAM reset, the intermittent screen and disk resets have stopped.  I am keeping fingers crossed.\nJanuary 30, 2016: The monitor/disk disconnects have restarted :-(\nFebruary 9, 2016: Has worked flawlessly for past 10 days, following another NVRAM reset.  I wish I could understand the problem a little better, what causes it in the first place and why it goes away after NVRAM reset?\n\nA: I have the OWC Thunderbolt 2 dock and used it for more than a year with a 2011 MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt Display, and HP monitor with no problems. I connected the Thunderbolt Display to my MacBook Pro, then connected the dock to the Thunderbolt Display with a Thunderbolt cable. The HP monitor was connected to the Thunderbolt Dock via HDMI. This setup allowed me to use both external displays as well as my MacBook Pro's display.\nI recently replaced the MacBook Pro with a 2011 iMac 21.5. Hooked everything up the same way -- iMac to the Thunderbolt Display, Thunderbolt Display to the Dock, HDMI from Dock to the HP Monitor. Everything works, at least for a few minutes, then the HP monitor goes dark and I all the disks connected to the Dock disconnect. Sometimes they immediately reconnect then disconnect so that the notifications cannot keep up.\nI've tried the NVRAM reset to see if that remedies the problem. What I've discovered, though, is that disconnecting the HDMI cable connecting the HP monitor and taking it out of the loop allows everything to work perfectly. No intermittent disk and Thunderbolt disconnects). I'm at a loss. I don't necessarily need three screens but it would be cool. I'm not understanding why the setup worked with the MacBook Pro but not the iMac.\n\nA: I have a theory that the OWC TB2 dock is periodically being power cycled.  I don't know if this is due to a faulty power supply, but mine is behaving this way.  Everything connected to it quickly disconnects and reconnects, which leads me to this theory.\n\nA: This is what the manual says regarding displays :\n\"If you are connecting only one display to the dock, you can do so via the following connection types: Thunderbolt, Mini Displayport, HDMI. \nHOWEVER, if you intend to connect two displays \nsimultaneously, you MUST use BOTH a native Thunderbolt display and a native HDMI display. Other combinations or adapters will not work.\"\nI connected the dock to an iMac 5K running 10.11.1, and within 30 seconds...kernel panic.  Prior to connecting the dock, the OS had an issue with USB3.\nThe latest update 10.11.4 fixed this issue :\n\"• Fixes an issue that caused USB audio devices to disconnect.\"\nSo, after updating the OS and switching the docks' power supply, it's finally playing nice.\nThe power supply I'm using is from a Lacie hard drive, 12v 1.5a\nThe power supply that came with the dock is 12v 6.0a.\nPerhaps the 6.0a is causing the dock to reset.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Try moving the wifi router away from the dock as possible. Your cell phone near to the dock during a call can also cause breakage. These two simple solutions enable me to work without nerves for the past 2 months.\n\nA: I gave up on it some time ago, but recently had to move to USB drive for Time Machine and put it back on. It  seems that the issue is only when both 30\" Cinema display and USB drive are connected. If I take the display out and unplug it from the current the drives work ok. I should have tested it for longer period of time but so far I use both in the following sequence: MacBook Pro Tunderbolt-OWC dock-then USB 3 and 30\" cinema are connected to the dock.\nIt does not make any difference in my case if the monitor is plugged directly to my laptop or not.\n\nA: I had the same issues you have. It turned out the Ambrosia audio support driver for Snapz Pro X was causing the system to throw away the dock at times. After removing it it's been good for a week now.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro, OS X El Capitan - Photo Problems I'm new to MacBooks and I take a lot of pictures. One of the things I appreciated of my previous Windows computer was that the photo organization was great.\nOn my Mac, when I download my photos into Pictures folder in Finder, it doesn't sync to my Photos Library. I have to go through and import every photo. And if I want to edit a photo in photos library, it doesn't update that same photo in my Pictures folder. \nI have a blog so I'm all the time uploading photos online. And if I want to upload a photo that I edited and try to open it from Photo Library, it won't let me. It only pulls up the Pictures folder, which doesn't have any of my edits.\n\nA: The reason is that, when you sync photos with the app, pictures are copied in the Library, so it is actually created a new version of each photo. When you modify it in the app, you will only edit that copy, and not the original one. \nIf you want to access the edited photos, you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just drag the pic from Photos to a specific folder: the photo will be copied again, with all the previous edits you made.\n\n*You can directly access the Library. Just go to Finder > Pictures > Photo Library. Right click on it > Show Package Contents > Masters: here you have all the photos, classified by date.

No error message, card seems to function, although not nearly at the speed I thought I had. That's a different issue. \n\nA: I'm pretty sure Snow Leopard does not provide native support for USB 3.0.\nThis is probably the main cause of your issue.  You would need to make sure you have installed the proper drivers for your PCI card in order for the kernel to recognize and allow this new functionality.\nOther possibilities:\nUSB 3.0 is inherently designed to draw way more power than USB 2.0.  It's possible that when you plugged the device in, that's when the machine actually recognized the PCI card itself (or at least realized the necessary power consumption for running such a card and the fact that it was trying to draw more power than it was able to support).\nAlso:\nAre you running any other PCI cards in your slots?

Menlo does not have any Thai characters, which I double-checked in Fontbook > View > Repertoire and also via the Menu bar > Show Emoji and Symbols. (But interestingly has Lao.) However, when I type Thai characters in the terminal, miraculously Thai appears. Apparently, there is a system wide default fallback font. However, one Thai character does not display properly. (Sara Am, สระ อำ) I can change the terminal font to CS Prajad and the Thai looks very good including the problem character. However the English font is hideously ugly and is useless as a programming font. \nI disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) in order to modify the xml file DefaultFontFallbacks.plist located in \n/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreText.framework/Versions/A/Resources then rebooted thinking that this would solve my problem.

Just can't figure out how to access the batterypercent param.\nEdit 2: \nLooking at the Bluetooth docs, it seems there's a Battery Service which exposes the Battery State and Battery Level.  The Battery Level can be read using the GATT Read Characteristic Value sub-procedure, so I need to figure out a way of interfacing with this service from the command line.

I use four cable connections to my MacbookPro: Power, thunderbolt to external monitor, thunderbolt to ethernet cable, and USB.  In a typical day, I need to disconnect and reconnect these many times as I take my laptop to meetings.  \nIs there any kind of \"cable concentrator\" that would let me plug everything into some kind of gizmo and then connect that via a single thunderbolt or USB cable to the Macbook?\nNote - I have a USB-C Mac and not a MagSafe Mac.\n\nA: I think the word you are looking for is docking station.\nOtherwise, if you have a spare laptop and the meetings are within the same building or VPN-enabled (i.e. on the same network as your MBP), you could just use the native OS X VNC server/client by enabling remote administration (or whatnot) in System Preferences.  Then just leave your MBP hooked up, and on the remote machine, open a Finder window, hit Cmd+k, and type vnc://ip.or.hostname.of.your.mbp, and hit enter.\nAlternately, if your company doesn't frown on it, you could use TeamViewer for remote access over the Internet.  It has built-in proxy support if you require that, as well.\nIf your spare is a Windows laptop, you can install xRDP for OS X, and use Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol to remote into your MBP.  I prefer RDP over VNC any day and use it almost exclusively on all of my *NIX machines.\n\nA: Yes, they exist but are not cheap. A better alternative might be a physical docking cradle where you can plug your Mac in as a whole. They usually come in the form of a \"bring your own cables\" kind of dock, which is purely a mechanical solution to your problem.\n", "Q: How I can force Safari App to download a file in local machine? just wondering if in Safari 9.0.1 is possible force a file to download.

I'm on a Mac now but am familiar with Linux as well.\nWhat I'm looking to do would be to take the zipped file, download it to my mac and then run the command to both unzip it and cat at one pop. Thus eliminating the tedious process of unzip file.zip and then copy each file, one at a time to run cat.\nI'm lame when it comes to writing a script and have played around with multiple commands, none that worked out.\n\nA: So I've done some testing, and it seems that gzcat (and event zcat) on OS X only work for gzipped files, and not files using standard zip compression.  That being said, I believe this is what you are looking for:\n\"sub.domain.tld.ssl.zip\" contains 2 files:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"sub.domain.tld.crt\" (SSL certificate)\n\n*\"sub.domain.tld.key\" (RSA private key)\n\n\nIn order to print all files to STDOUT, you would use unzip -p\nTo \"cat\" the certificate, you could use the following command:\nunzip -p sub.domain.tld.ssl.zip | sed -n '/CERT/,/CERT/p'\n\nTo \"cat\" the private key, you could use the following command:\nunzip -p sub.domain.tld.ssl.zip | sed -n '/KEY/,/KEY/p'\n\nAfterwards, of which you could do what you wish, such as create a little script or function:\n#!/bin/bash\nunzip -p \"$1\" | sed -n '/CERT/,/CERT/p' > \"/etc/ssl/Certs/${2}.crt\"\nunzip -p \"$1\" | sed -n '/KEY/,/KEY/p' > \"/etc/ssl/Private/${2}.key\"\n\nThe above script would take 2 arguments (which should ideally be enclosed in quotes):\n\n\n*\n\n*File name of zip file\n\n*Naming convention of cert/key files\n\n\nIf the name of the script was sslinstazip.sh, you would run it like so:\n./sslinstazip.sh \"sub.domain.tld.ssl.zip\" \"sub.domain.tld\"\n\nThere are obviously many ways you can modify this to fit your own personal needs, but in this case, unzip is actually your friend.\n\nA: I actually found a way to do this with the help of a friend at work tonight.\n#!/bin/bash\n#Script to run unzip and cat in one command\n\nzipinfo -1 $1 > $1.txt;\nunzip $1;\nfor i in $(cat $1.txt); do echo \"File : $i >>\" && cat $i; done\n\nSaved it in TextWrangler as uzipcat.sh and ran chmod u+x\nTo run it I type ./uzipcat.sh sslfilename.zip and it extracts it plus prints the contents.\nThanks for the interest and suggestions!\n\nA: Skip the unzip and use gzcat directly.

If you want to avoid this output when this command fails (which won't hurt anything), just redirect STDERR to /dev/null, which would make the above commands as follows:\nps aux | grep -i [s]potify | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null\n\nor\nkill -9 $(ps aux | grep -i [s]potify | awk '{print $2}') 2>/dev/null\n\nI actually have an extremely handy function in one of my dotfiles, which gets sourced in my .bash_profile during every terminal session, which is as follows (please excuse the language -- but this is really what I call it):\nfuckyou() { ps aux | grep -i \"$1\" | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; }\n\nFor me, this creates the fuckyou command, which takes one argument (the name of whatever offending process I wish to terminate), finds the process ID (PID) of that process and terminates it.\nThis way, if you were me, you could simply run fuckyou spotify.\nThe one caveat is if there are multiple processes running with the same same, such as Spotify.app and com.spotifyhelper.plist or something, you would either need to explicity specify \"Spotify.app\", but grep -i is case insensitive, so you could say fuckyou 'Spotify.app'.\nIf you wanted to kill all processes under a certain name (as in all processes associated with Spotify), you would need to put the one-liner in a for or while loop, such as this:\nfor i in $(ps aux | grep -i [s]potify | awk '{print $2}'); do kill -9 \"$i\" 2>/dev/null; done\n\nThis is basically telling Bash to do the follwoing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print all running process names along with their process IDs (ps aux)\n\n*Do a case-insensitive search for \"spotify\" on this output (the bracketed first character will prevent returning the grep -i spotify process)\n\n*Grab only the second column of process IDs (which should now only include processes related to Spotify)\n\n*For all of these Spotify-related processes, force each one to terminate\n\n", "Q: As part of \"nuking it from orbit\", is it safe to reinstall the OS using Recovery?

But even after doing this, I noticed the day after of setting up my Macbook as new again that one of my iCal entries were edited that I didn't make...\nHowever, I read somewhere that it's best to reinstall the OS from a non-recovery partition source because if there is/was a RAT/trojan on my Macbook, said RAT/trojan could modify some files in the recovery partition without my knowledge thus leading me to unwittingly install a backdoored OS. Does this seem plausible? Should I once again try and erase/reinstall the OS from a bootable drive at a Genius Bar?\n\nA: You are correct - a suitably advanced attacker could technically rewrite the OS on the recovery HD to point it to a bad source when you reinstall the OS.\nBetter would to be use internet recovery since that would require even more advanced work to compromise the firmware on the Mac. \nBest would be to bring a bootable installer from a machine you have more confidence hasn’t been comnptromised.\nIn 98% of the time - all of the above steps to erase the hard drive and reinstall the OS are going to be equally effective, but there are increased levels of safety to be had than just using the self-contained recovery HD.\n", "Q: What is 'symptomsd\" and why is it at times using 60% of my iMac's CPU?

I tried manually killing and triggering it to launch again, and it seems to examine all the applications installed on my iMac and then go back to making lots of \"ioctl\" requests.\nSearching on Google all I've been able to determine is that this seems to be one of those things that is shared between OSX and iOS. No information anywhere on what it actually does though.\nAnyone have any idea what this process is for or know anywhere it is documented?\n\nA: I have an iMac and had the same issue. It appears to be a bug in Mac OS X. \nIn my case, I had both Ethernet and Wifi turned on for my iMac. Turning Off Ethernet in System Preferences > Network, keeping Wifi as the only connection, prevents the issue completely. Now, the symptomsd consumes about 0.2 ~ 0.3 % CPU load as it's supposed to. \nI started to experience only recently after upgrade to Mac OS X 10.11.1.

The problem occurs whenever I position the caret on a new, empty line.\nIf I change the font style to bold (or turn off bold), Pages automatically highlights (selects) the empty line, which reveals an invisible format character. If there is text below the line the caret is positioned on, after I start typing, Pages deletes the entire line and moves the text up because the line was empty to begin with.\nScreenshot to better illustrate this. The caret is positioned between the two lines of text. When I, for instance, turn bold on or off, the following happens:\n\nThe new line is selected, so once I start typing, Pages deletes the entire line and the new format style is cleared. This is really irritating because every time I change the font style now, I have to deselect the new line manually by clicking away from it, using the arrow keys, or something like that so it won't overwrite the new line.\nIs there any way to stop this from happening?\n\nA: This is indeed an annoyance with Pages.\nOne way around this:\n\n\n*\n\n*While at the end of the preceding line and before adding the new line, change your formatting, then tap return and type your new line.\n\n", "Q: How does Fandango know my real credit card number through Apple Pay?

I purchased a wireless charger adapter and pad for my phone and want to know if it is safe to leave overnight. once the electricity reaches the adapter it has no where to go.. if it were connected it would go back into the wire right? So is this wireless charging safe? \n\nA: Your terminology is slightly off. The \"charger\" is actually a chip INSIDE the phone that manages everything about the way your phone is charged, including overcharge protection, thermal protections, and much more. The power adapters are just that: power adapters. They're used for providing DC power to the charger within the phone.\nI'm honestly not sure how any kind of 3rd party wireless charging solution works.\n\nA: \"back into the wire\" is a very strange concept. \nLet me explain...\nThink of a parallel.\nWhat happens when you flick the wall-switch off?\nWhere does the power go?\nBack down the wire? \nNo. It simply goes nowhere, it stays where it is. \nOnce the charger stops drawing power [or reduces it to a trickle] the surplus power simply goes nowhere; it isn't drawn from the circuit.\nSomeone else gets to use it to boil a kettle, in another house, in another street.\n I'm aware that this is very much an over-simplification\n", "Q: Force CD ejection from SuperDrive My SuperDrive, USB connected to a 2012 Mac Mini with latest El Capitan OS X, has been working just fine until I tried to rip a purchased CD from a small singer songwriter.

Greetings: I've been reading the helpful comments regarding what browser is compatible with a dated OS. My Safari browser is 5.0.6. I'm going to paste my query here. I posted it on another Mac forum whose members get a little testy toward those who are not tech savvy: \nI'm a senior (and I'm not talking high school) who's had Macs since the early '90s. However, I tend to cling to whatever works. Change, particularly technical change, is intimidating. As a result, I've been plugging along on my comfortable iMac for a long time. As you can imagine, things are getting weird: pages won't load, the system quits, I get shut out of many sites, etc. I tried going with the Firefox browser but a message said I don't have the requirements. I realize someone else had a similar problem and I read the answers but am as confused as ever. I don't need the latest technology. I just need to get back on track with the least amount of stress. My question: Should I take it to the Mac store or is there something I can do at home? Needless to say, I need to keep it simple. Thanks in advance for anything you can share with me. \n\nA: You should try TenFourFox as it is a clone of the latest firefox.\nThe PPC version will work on an Intel machine via emulation. Pick the g3 version.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/tenfourfox/wiki/WhichVersion\n", "Q: How do I find out which Game Center account a game is tied to? I played Clash of Clans one year ago and I have many game center accounts.\nMy problem is that I forgot which game center account has my game progress. How do I know which registered account is linked with Clash of Clans?\n\nA: The only way to find out is to login with every known account.  Gamecenter accounts are easily changeable and doing so doesn't affect the rest of your device because your Apple-ID/iCloud login is seperated from your Gamecenter account.\nWhile Supercell, the developer of CoC is very helpful when you have account issues, it is impossible for them to look it up for you.  Gamecenter and other game related data is not stored under your Gamecenter email ID.  It is stored using a hashed number, visually unrelated with your real human readable login credentials.\nIf - perhaps long time ago - you contacted Supercell about any issues, they might have your hash-id in their archives.  If not, the only option you have is to manually try them all.\n", "Q: How do I share Processing apps with an expired signature? I made an application with Processing that I exported to a .app file. It works just fine on my computer. When I download my app from the Internet and try to open it, I get the following message: \n\nMyApp.app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash.\n\nAs users on this site have noticed, many Apple certificates expired on 11/11/2015, making it impossible to run these applications if Gatekeeper is enabled. Processing seems to be signing with expired signatures as well. How do I remove these signatures?\n\nA: An application in the form of a .app file is actually a folder containing lots of different files and folders that make up the resources of the application. To keep them all nice and tidy for Mac OS X, you can bundle them all together in a Disk Image .dmg file which can more easily be manipulated by non-Mac systems without getting the details messed up when brought back to the Mac.\nSome quick directions copied from a reference listed later:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a folder with the files your DMG will contain.\n\n*Open Disk Utility (It's in /Applications/Utilities/)\n\n*Go to File > New > New Image from Folder (Cmd + Shift + N)\n\n*Choose the folder containing you files\n\n*Make sure \"Compressed\" is checked, then set where you want to save the created DMG\n\n\nYou can create the DMG file out of the .app file directly since the .app file is already a directory. \nMore detailed info about alternatives and command line directions are at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/367751/creating-a-dmg as well as http://blog.nngafook.com/2012/07/app-to-dmg/\n\nA: You can use the unsign tool on the executable file inside the MyApp.app package. After downloading the .zip file, to compile the binary go to Terminal and enter cd ~/Downloads/unsign-master (or wherever you extracted the zip file), then enter make. Next enter sudo cp unsign /usr/bin/unsign. Next find my MyApp.app in Finder. Then type cd, type a space, and then drag MyApp.app into the Terminal, and push enter. Then enter cd Contents/MacOS. Next enter unsign MyApp MyApp. Now your app no longer has a signature. When users try to open it, they will get an \"Unidentified Developer\" message. Therefore tell them to right-click on it and select \"Open\" to be able to open it. \n", "Q: Many OS X app store apps are listed as \"app\" is damaged and can't be opened Without having changed anything, I now get this message when I try to open the app \"Breeze\" - Other apps fail similarly on other Macs:\n\nI tried to get rid of this message by re-installing it from the App Store, but nothing changes. Rebooting and changing gatekeeper security preferences also doesn't help by choosing \"allow Apps downloaded from anywhere\". \nWhat the heck is going on?\n\nA: It looks like the receipts embedded in applications downloaded from the Mac App Store are being signed with an expired certificate.\nTapbot's Paul Haddad pointed out the issue earlier today on Twitter.\nhttps://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/664653066679906304\nFor some users rebooting is enough to prompt the operating system to retrieve new receipts from the Store. Other users find they are being prompted to log in to the Mac App Store again to update application receipts. Other developers like C-Command Software suggest that users delete applications and download them again. \n\nA: Pretty much everyone is in the same boat as you. The situation is quite complicated, but this picture shows some of the details of the layers of certificates involved in making a \"receipt\" file:\n\nApple engineers used a certificate that is marked as Not VALID After : Nov 11 21:58:01 2015 GMT to sign apps that were downloaded for a long period this year. Additionally, one of the certificates used to be signed with Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption and is transitioning to sha256WithRSAEncryption which isn't fully supported by all OS and developers.\nThe best write up (of many good ones) is by Ben Toms:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://macmule.com/2015/11/12/some-mac-app-store-apps-damaged-prompting-for-redownload/\nIn a nutshell, one of the keys making up the wrapper that apps use to verify a proper App Store download expired yesterday. Apple has renewed that certificate, but you might need to take action now to remedy this error.\nOddly, the apps that Apple itself made, rely on some other validation chain of trust since they include this same now expired certificate yet still run on OS X. Basically, those apps seem to use another (or no) validation of the receipt for correctness. \nIf you're comfortable with the command line, try restarting the process that tends to these now outdated app receipts:\nkillall -KILL storeaccountd\n\nIf you power off your Mac, that also cycles the accounts daemon and should fix things so you don't have to re-download the apps to the computer after the time when that one Apple certificate expired.\nAt this point, when you try to run the app, you should be prompted to re-enter your password one time. This will get you a new certificate from Apple which may or may not solve the actual breakage depending on how or if the application uses the receipt file.\nAnother thing that can cure false certificate failures is to check your date/time settings and then try signing out of the Mac App Store entirely. If you still cannot run the app after signing back in, you might be forced with deleting the app and re-downloading it after verifying your date/time and rebooting the OS. Be sure to check spotlight and delete all copies of the app. Empty the trash before trying to restore the download.\nIf all else fails, contacting both the developer of your specific app as well as Apple Support for guidance might be prudent since the programs that handle this receipt validation and generation are not well documented. \nBig thanks also to Craig Hockenberry and Paul Haddad for the great technical explanations on what's happening here. Without community working together we might be in the dark far longer when uncomfortable breakages like this arise. \n", "Q: How to create an ISO from a file (not a directory) I'm trying to perform some testing on old platforms. In this case, its Fedora 1 (circa 2002 or 2003). The VM software (VMware and VirtualBox) can't handle distros that old, so the guests don't have a network card.\nI found I could transfer stuff to them through the CD Rom drive. However, when I attempt to build an ISO with a file I am trying to transfer:\nhdiutil makehybrid -o ~/image.iso ~/make-4.1.tar.gz -iso -joliet\nCreating hybrid image...\n\nhdiutil: makehybrid failed - Operation not permitted\n\nI also tried with create, but that result in an error, too:\nhdiutil create -ov ~/make-4.1.tar.gz  -iso -joliet\nhdiutil: create: unknown option \"-iso\"\nUsage:  hdiutil create <sizespec> [options] <imagepath>\n    hdiutil create -help\n\nI've also tried with and without the option makehybrid.\nHow do I create an ISO of a file (and not a directory)?\n\nI want to avoid unzipping and then building the ISO because filenames and permissions are changed (This is older software that's not as stable as it is today).\n\nA: You can't create an ISO image from a non-image file. hdiutil and especially hdiutil makehybrid expect an image or a directory (not necessarily containing files!).\n\nBut you don't have to unzip/unarchive anything. Just create a folder with the name MAKE, move the gz file into it and then enter hdiutil makehybrid -o ~/make.iso ~/MAKE -iso -joliet. The resulting mounted image just contains the file make-4.1.tar.gz.\nThe permissions of the iso mounted to the file system of the Fedora VM should then be: \n# ls -al /dev/cdrom*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 [date] /dev/cdrom -> devicename #e.g. sr0 or something similar, it depends on your distro and the /etc/fstab file inside the VM\n\nand the file make-4.1.tar.gz \"inside\" is world readable.\nAfter copying the gz file to your user folder in the VM, unarchive/unzip it.\n\nA: To reduce Klanomath's answer to a recipe:\nmkdir -p /tmp/MAKE\nrm -f ./make.iso\ncp make-4.1.tar.gz /tmp/MAKE/make-4.1.tar.gz\nhdiutil makehybrid -o ./make.iso /tmp/MAKE/ -iso -joliet\n\nThen, mount make.iso in the virtual machine.\nBe aware of the race conditions when using /tmp. They are not a worry to me because this is for local testing, and not production.\n", "Q: Apple Configurator 2: Where are the Blueprints? Apple Configurator 2 is scriptable with Automator, Apple-Script and Shell.\nNowhere it is though possible to invoke the blueprints I have defined in Configurator.\nI can rebuild the contents of those blueprints within Automator, Apple-Script and Shell, but I cannot reuse, what I already built in Configurator.\nOr am I wrong? Where are those blueprints?\n\nA: My understanding (which could be wrong) is that blueprints are for people that don't automate things. You pick from a palette of options and build up \"automation\" from within the app.\nIf you want to shell script, you would just install the cfgutil Automation tools and have your script written to perform the steps you want. Basically, the blueprint steps aren't exposed to the command line tool in the current design of the app. If you want to use both, you'll have to set up your scripts and blueprints redundantly which is more work, more chance for error and more maintenance. Whether you make that time back depends on how many devices you have to manage and how efficient you are at setting things up.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://krypted.com/iphone/apple-configurator-2/\n", "Q: Apple Configurator 2: Apply Blueprint one by one I have 48 iPads here and if I apply a blueprint to all of them at once, the network to the MDM server is jammed. If I apply the blueprint one by one to each iPad, every thing goes smoothly.\nIs there a way to tell Configurator to apply a blueprint one by one?\n\nA: No, not with Version 2.1 (3B42) of Apple Configurator. There are some workarounds that come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could make smaller groups and keep the same blueprints\n\n*You could determine the limiting factor in your MDM responsiveness and address that to handle 50 devices at once.\n\n*You could re-implement the blueprint in a script and have that script iterate over the group with delays that resolve the bottleneck.\n\n\nIt really depends on what you are doing. If you cannot add a simple blueprint that adds one Web Clip to all 48 devices, then you might need to rethink your MDM or infrastructure. I'm having a hard time imagining something that saturates a link to MDM since they generally are quite efficient and just transfer configuration data and not loads of document data.\n", "Q: Wiping An Apple Mac For Resale I don't use my Mac so I'm going to sell it. I want to give the customer a clean Mac, so I have completely wiped the HD and reinstalled Mac OS X. I've been reading about people getting locked out of their second-hand Mac and it being still linked to the previous owner's account. I wanted to know if this is the case because I want them to be happy with it and be able to use it when they get it. I logged out of iTunes and iCloud and turned off Find My Mac, then I did the full wipe and reinstall. Now I'm up to selecting the language and stuff. Is this enough? I want it to be new and without an account but watching a video when they went back onto the Mac they had to log into their account again.\nShould I complete the setup and see or will I be fine leaving it?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you've erased the drive, you're most of the way there. It really depends on what you want the experience for the buyer to be. I would print out this web page and check mark what you did so the buyer's mind and yours are both at ease:\n\"What to do before selling or giving away your Mac\" - \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065\nThe last step (6 of 6) reads:\n\nAfter you reformat your hard drive and reinstall OS X, the computer restarts to a Welcome screen and asks you to choose a country or region. If you want to leave the Mac in an out-of-box state, don't continue with the setup of your system. Instead, press Command-Q to shut down the Mac. When the new owner turns on the Mac, the Setup Assistant will guide them through the setup process.\n\nIf your Mac doesn't come with Internet Recovery, you might consider making a USB drive for them to install the version of OS you want to ship. They can always call AppleCare and arrange for replacement media or a download code to redeem the version of OS that shipped with the Mac in question. Most recent hardware works with Internet Recovery and most older hardware has physical install media you can/should ship with the hardware or that could be ordered for nominal cost from Apple.\n", "Q: MacbookPro bootable Windows USB not visible I have a MacBookPro retina (id MacBookPro10,1 mid 2012) with El Capitan installed and want to create a Windows partition through BootCamp. I already did that some time ago without that much trouble, but had to wipe out the entire harddrive and install both systems from scratch.\nThis time I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*By \"hacking\" BootCamp made it install Windows 7 boot into a USB I have.\n\n*Downloaded and copied over BootCamp drivers for windows into this bootable stick.\n\n*Disabled FileVault, that prevented external devices (even recovery HD) from being seen on boot.\n\n*Turned off System Integrity Protection (had to do that already to make step 1 happen) with csrutil disable in recovery.\n\n\nThe problem I am having now is that the USB is not visible on (hold option key) boot even if it is plugged in and is lighting up. I tried installing reFit, but it also does not see the USB. Not only that, the interesting thing is that this USB is not even visible in reFit partition table you can see in the options.\nUPD: another interesting thing, the USB is not visible in startup disk setting inside OSX, this may mean that for some reason even if the USB drive itself is visible, Mac does not recognize it as bootable. Or is it because startup disk is not able to see USBs at all?\nHow can I troubleshoot this on El Capitan?\n\nA: I managed to install Windows 8 on the system, and would like to post my findings, since I am sure others will run into the same issues I faced.\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem reported in this post had to do with the windows iso images themselves, not with Bootcamp or EFI. To make sure your system will even see the USB at all, make sure it has the file /efi/boot/bootx64.efi otherwise Mac will not even see the usb as a bootable device.\nTo anyone speaking Russian, this link will be very informative on how the entire process works http://geektimes.ru/post/213223/.\n\n*If you are installing Windows 8 (I would still like to know if anyone managed to install Windows 7) make sure you do everything through BootCamp, especially partitioning, since the first time I tried editing the partitions manually, I managed to screw up my recovery partition (repaired by downloading and installing El Capitan again without data loss). Not only that, I managed to stop seeing 'could not set up bootable device' errors only when I went through all three steps in Bootcamp on a single session. What I really dislike is that downloading fairly large amount of drivers during step 2 of BootCamp fails if there is a network problem, and I had to restart the entire process a lot of times.\n\n*I ran first aid on recovery partition as shown in this post: \nProblem Installing Boot Camp Windows Partition on new Mac Pro\nbut judging from documentation of El Capitan this should not be necessary since the OS should repair write permissions automatically, therefore I am not sure whether the method shown here is necessary any longer. I did not reset my PRAM.\n\n*During the last part of Windows installation, the one after you create the user account and wait, the computer froze. However, after hard reset the system started normally and I could make the last step of installing BootCamp drivers from the USB.\nTo sum it up, make sure the Windows image is x64 and bootable by EFI and make sure to carry out USB creation, driver installation and partitioning of the system by BootCamp only and in a single clean swipe. \n", "Q: Yosemite and El Capitan USB crash kills keyboard and trackpad I'm seeing a similar issue to MBP 2013 becoming unresponsive to keyboard and mouse, but this is with no external USB devices at all. \nPeriodically/intermittently, my keyboard and trackpad will stop responding, and I am forced to hold the power button down to shutdown and restart the laptop.\nIt was being triggered most frequently when plugging and unplugging an Arduino, but has happened on occasion after resuming from sleep with no USB devices connected. It was possible on some occasions to plug in an external keyboard and mouse and shutdown cleanly, but that does not seem to be possible more recently, perhaps since I upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan (clean install, trying to solve this issue).\nThe MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) keyboard and trackpad become completely unresponsive, the only working \"input\" is the power button, which I guess bypasses the USB stack entirely.\nI have got to the point of installing PowerKey, and running a script that will trigger a shutdown and restart if the power button is pressed repeatedly in a short time. At least this will give programs a chance to save their state before shutdown.\nWhat I'm really looking for is how to reset the USB stack entirely. I tried the following:\n$ sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.usb.AppleUSBXHCIPCI\n$ sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.usb.AppleUSBXHCIPCI\n\nand then reloading it, but that left the keyboard and mouse unusable still. (I tried this via SSH, before the problem manifested itself. i.e. the keyboard and mouse were working prior to the kextunload)\nI then tried doing a diff of the loaded kext's before and after the unload, and reloading all the other kexts that were removed, but that still did not result in a working keyboard.\nAny suggestions? Do I need to load the kext's in a particular order, perhaps? Is there a script/program that knows what that order is (I assume so, since they get loaded successfully on startup!)\n\nA: The start up sequence is kind of hard to emulate other than actually power cycling the computer. \nI don't have a good answer since his failure is extremely low level, but here are the things I would do to troubleshoot and isolate things before considering a total reinstallation of the OS:\n\n\n*\n\n*run sysdiagnose script each time a failure happens to capture the logs and also gain a sense of how often this happens. \n\n*verify that plugging in the USB keyboard does not kick start the system properly for internal or external keyboard function\n\n*log out the user using kill -9 -1 or via remote screen sharing\n\n\nMy guess is the logs will show USB errors indicating a hardware fault, but that would need a look at your specific logs. It's not clear why you are manually loading the kext so perhaps I'm missing some information?\n\nA: So, to close this loop, I have not had this happen for quite a while (many months, possibly a full year or more), which seems to have been as a result of installing OS updates.\nGood news!\n", "Q: iMac not shutting down since upgrading to OS X 10.11, El Capitan The iMac will not shutdown as normal, the spinning loader is visible and it stays in that state if I don't interrupt it using the power button.\nI want to be able to shutdown as normal, at present I'm having to use the power button on the back to interrupt.\nI've noticed a few posts on here with the same problem, unfortunately i dont have enough 'reputation points' to comment on their thread. My workflow has stalled to a halt since upgrading to OS X 10.11, El Capitan. Adobe InDesign is terrible and I am really disheartened with Apple for the first time since 1988.\nI checked the filesystem with Disk Utility.\n\nA: I have found that clearing all cache and font maintenance resolved the issue.   \nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*\nrm -rf ~/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/*\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/*\natsutil databases -removeUser\nsudo atsutil databases -remove\nsudo atsutil server -shutdown\nsudo atsutil server -ping\nsudo rm -rf /var/folders/*\n\nRestart immediatly\n\nA: I also  had this problem and I spent about an hour on the phone with Apple. It turns out that there was an issue with a 3rd party application. \nOnce i went into System Preferences > Users and Groups> then into Login Items and deleted all of the items in the list, my computer was able to shut down properly. \n\nA: If you use Avid products you might try removing:\n/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/Avid CoreAudio.plugin/ \n\nor \n/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/Digidesign CoreAudio.plugin/ \n\nthis was the cause of three of our computers not shutting down after the El Capitan upgrade.  After removing the first shutdown will require sudo shutdown -r now from the terminal or press and hold the power button.  This solved the problem for all three computers for us.\n\nA: If you have an update pending it may be trying to install that before shutting down and you are interrupting it. Check to see if you have any updates pending that require a restart. Mac OS X 10.11.1 is out and it requires a restart with a fair bit of time to install.\n\nA: I had this problem as well.  I could not shutdown from the Apple menu or even logout.  All desktop items and menu bar would disappear when I tried to shutdown, but the dock stayed and machine would never shut down.  I could even reopen applications in the dock, except Finder. However, I could shut down by going to the Login Screen and clicking on ShutDown there.\nTried all the usual resets, starting and shutting down in Safe Mode, etc.\nAfter reading all the posts I could find, and trial and error, I discovered it was my fault.  I had deleted application files (in my case, CiscoVPN) from my hard drive, without doing the uninstall process.  I finally noticed that the iMac still had CiscoVPN as a startup item (Apple menu > About This Mac > System Report > Software > Startup items).  I was lucky that the Cisco website included explicit instructions for removing CiscoVPN from Startup.  I copy/pasted the lines from the Cisco instructions into Terminal, restarted the computer, and now it shuts down normally and quickly.\nNote that I don't believe CiscoVPN had a problem - it just happened to be the thing my iMac was looking for on startup and was probably still looking for it when I tried to shutdown.  So check your startup items and make sure that if something is there, the application is also in your machine.\n\nA: I had, and still have, the same problem. Something I have installed either needs updating or has become corrupt and I can't work out what it is. I have found a simple work around though.\nWhen you want to shut down, first close all open programs. Then BEFORE you choose shut down, choose \"FORCE QUIT\" Finder. When Finder starts itself again you should be able to shut down as normal without having to hold the power key down ( as I have been for months!)\nGood luck \nTony\n\nA: I've had this problem with two iMacs at work since upgrading. Bizarrely, none of the macbooks around the office seem to be exhibiting this.\nThe only solution/workaround that I've found is to make sure the trash is empty before I shut down. I can't explain why this works for me but it just does. \nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Identifying bottlenecks In any computer, there is a bottleneck. The processor, the amount of memory, the bus to the hard drive, etc.\nI just ordered a 2010 MacPro, 12 core, and although the 12*3.33 GHz cores should give me more than 3x the performance of my quad 2.8 GHz, I understand it probably won't. I am wondering what the weak link will be and how to improve it. The first thing I'm considering is a PCI card with 2 SSD RAID 0 to run the OS. On my old Pro, I saw amazing boot times from a shift to SSD. \nThe Mac will have 32GB of RAM, I'm assuming that's enough. \nUpdate - One example of an intensive process is video encoding. How do I find whether writing to the hard drives is the slowdown, i.e. that raid 0 for the hard drives would help the speed? \nAny other advice? How do I identify the bottlenecks once this machine is running? \n\nA: OP I think you're looking at the problem a little backwards. Your weakest link will inherently be the I/O bus.\nThat being said, raid-0 on PCI-e SSDs will be quite performant.\nYou need to ask yourself a couple questions\n\n\n*\n\n*What are you trying to optimize for? Its a mac pro and you're cosnidering a significant $ investment, so you're probably doing some professional work. Keep in mind though that you're sinking a lot of money into a 5+ year old machine, and the parts won't be reusable on any new mac pro you buy in the future\n\n*What are your pain points now? You just ordered this machine, so you haven't actually used it yet as part of your workflow. Firstly, you might find it more than adequate for what you want to do. But currently, what are the things you are struggling with? We can help answer from there.\n\nA: The \"biggest\" bottleneck will be the I/O, as that is the slowest bus on the system (in comparison with the CPU and memory buses). \nBecause you're willing to use PCIe, even the 2.0 version that's on the MacPro from that era, you should be able to get closer to the SATA 3 speeds (6Gb/s) of modern SSD's (afaik, the onboard SATA bus is SATA II  -- 3 Gb/s).\nYour best bet for looking at bottlenecks is taking a look at the specifications (I believe there is a 3.3Ghz CPU with matching memory speeds that will also give you a little less bottleneckage).\n", "Q: Signing an App that includes Java fails I try to sign an app-bundle that includes the Java Runtime Environment 8 (JRE).\nFrom command line I run this command:\ncodesign -s \"Developer ID Application: My Company\" /Development/MyApp.app\n\nI get this output:\nMyApp.app: code object is not signed at all\nIn subcomponent: /Development/MyApp.app/Contents/PlugIns/jre8/Contents/Home/jre/COPYRIGHT\n\nThe result is that the App-bundle doesn't get signed as expected.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: code signing\nThe friendly manual on code signing says to sign the sub-component first, then try again with your app itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2206/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007919-CH1-TNTAG305\ncodesign says my code is unsigned when I try to sign it.\nMake sure all nested code is already signed and its signature is valid. Xcode will take care of this for you if you let it handle your code signing tasks.\nIt goes on to say let Xcode handle all the signing, which may or may not be helpful since you are already choosing to sign things from the command line.\n--deep\nTo sign all nested code in one go, add the --deep argument to codesign:\ncodesign --deep -s \"Developer ID Application: My Company\" /Development/MyApp.app\n\nshell script\nAnother way of doing the same is to create a shell script that checks the signature state of the nested code, and signs if it is missing. This way you may get more control on what you are signing within the bundle.\nExample:\nA bash-script called sign-unsigned.sh that checks one entry in the bundle and signs it if it is not already signed could be done like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nif codesign --verify $1 ; then \n   exit; \nelse\n   codesign --sign \"$2\" $1;\nfi\n\nPut the sign-unsigned.sh in /Development and do this on the command line:\ncd /Development/MyApp.app/\nfind . -exec ../sign-unsigned.sh {} \"Developer ID Application: My Company\" \\;\ncodesign --sign \"Developer ID Application: My Company\" ../MyApp.app\n\n", "Q: Where does the notification sound come from in OS X? I'm using El Capitan, and this happens in Yosemite as well.\nOnce a while I hear the notification sound, same as the sound when a new email arrive in Mail.app. But nowhere can I find where it comes from. There is no new email, or any red badge shows up in the icons in the dock or launch pad. And there is no new notification in the notification centre, and no alert appeared in the upper right corner of the screen. It appears nothing happened, except for the notification sound. How can I find what app generates it?\n\nA: I seems that I use filters in GMail to skip inbox, and the sound is actually come from Mail.app. As a result, no new mail arrives to the Inbox of Mail.app, but to the Archive of the Mail.app.\nIn the preference of Mail.app, one option is to choose \"Inbox Only\" for \"New message notifications\".

I have been searching and trying to correct my mid 2011 MacBook Air screen when you startup by holding the option key. My Bootcamp no longer shows but the created USB Windows 10 install stick does even though it is not connected. \nI have Yosemite, latest version, and Parallels 10, latest version. I have imported my Bootcamp as VM and it works perfectly in Parallels and it used to work as a startup OS.\nSince I usually use Parallels to access my Windows install I am not sure when it quit working.\nThe Windows install stick has been living on the option start screen since my son made it and we used it to install Windows 10 back in August. \nAnother recent find was my recovery partition, which showed, but failed to boot. I was able to access Internet Recovery but it only wanted to install Lion, strange. I managed to fix that by target disc mode with my MacBook Pro and reinstalling Yosemite, but still have the Bootcamp issue and the USB stick \"ghost.\"\n\nA: Try clearing out your computer's NVRAM by holding down  Cmd ⌘ Optionp r while booting (until you hear a second chime), and see if this solves the problem.\n", "Q: Pair magic keyboard with iPad I cannot pair my new Magic keyboard with my iPad. It shows up in the Bluetooth devices list as \"Bluetooth Keyboard\", but when I click to connect it I get the message: \n\nConnection Unsuccessful Make sure \"Bluetooth Keyboard\" is turned on and in range.\n\nHow can I pair the devices?\n\nA: I went to the Genius Bar to solve this. They did the standard procedure and the device paired.\nThe explanation for why it was not working for me was that a Magic Keyboard will not pair while it is charging. I had the keyboard plugged into a USB port for charging at the time. To use or pair the keyboard, make sure it is unplugged.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  You can't \"swap out batteries\" b/c it doesn't have any. Once I paired the keyboard to my computer, it would not re-pair to my iPad...even if I \"forget\" the keyboard from my computer.  Very frustrating that there is no way to force the keyboard into pairing mode.\nSolution was to tell the iPad to \"Forget\" the keyboard too. Then it was able to re-pair. \n\nA: For people with the older Apple Bluetooth Keyboard:\nMake sure that when you've pressed the power button on the side of the keyboard that the green light turns on that is on the top of the keyboard. If it doesn't, maybe try swapping out the batteries. \nThis answer doesn't apply with the newer Magic Keyboard with rechargeable batteries; for that one, see the other answers.\n", "Q: iCloud lock - how to interpret the number of asterisks present I forgot my pin to my phone so I hooked it to my computer to do an update/restore.\nWhen the update/restore was done, my phone is now icloud locked and I'm getting this screen:\n\nI can't remember what email I used for this but my question is:\ncan \"t*****@m*****.com\" only be equal to something like\n\ntjones@mjones.com (i.e., 5 characters where the asterisks are representing the number of characters)?\nOr can it be:\ntjohnson123214@mjohnson25345342343@co.uk\n\n(i.e., (1) are the asterisks only a place-holder for any length of text?

Recently started noticing a weird location on my  husbands iPhone at odd hours--saying he was in a location across town when he was literally sitting in front of me--it is same location every time.  would switching to private or incognito browsing cause that to happen?\n\nA: The Wifi location database is created by driving round, street to street, city to city, country to country, testing what WiFi can be 'seen' & mapping it to GPS locations.\nNone of this requires any login to the WiFi, merely noting where it is located.\nThis can take a while ;) \nIn the meantime, someone might move house, from one district to another, & take their WiFi with them. This will confuse the geo-locators until the next time the Wifi guy drives past again.\nAlternatively, an ISP may assign a new IP address to a residence's connection - one outside their usual numeric range. This will produce the same effect.\nMy ISP recently did this here & I \"moved\" from London to Bristol for 2 weeks, whenever I was in the house, picking up my own home WiFi.\n", "Q: Divvy application not opening or showing any error message The window manager divvy is a big part of my workflow.

I do this using the inspector. \nUnfortunately, whenever I ssh into a machine, my tabs get renamed. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? Perhaps there's some kind of shell script I could run in my bash profile to prevent this?\n\nA: Using iTerm2 you actually have an option for that:\nJust uncheck Preferences->Profiles->Your Profile->Terminal->Terminal may set tab/window title.\n\n\nA: You can setup a new or change an existing profile in the settings of Terminal.\nChoose your new or the existing profile and click on Window and uncheck all the options at the Title segment.\nEdit:\nFor shells which change the promt via shell variable PS1 you have to deal with it as long you connected the the given host without changing the promt on the remote session.\nTo change this in a bash you will find something like\n\n# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir\ncase \"$TERM\" in\nxterm*|rxvt*)\n    PS1=\"\\[\\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\H: \\w\\a\\]$PS1\"\n    ;;\n*)\n    ;;\nesac\n\nin your .bashrc.\nIf you comment out this block your local title will not change but your promt may be looking awful.\nMaybe there are other lines where the shell variable PS1 is set. Maybe you have to comment out these too.\nEdit2:\nAlso you have the ability to give the local PS1 to the remote session.\nTo do so you invoke ssh with\nssh -o SendEnv=PS1 user@host\n\nBut for this you have to edit the sshd_config.\nThere you have to add PS1 to the list of AcceptEnv.\nThis requires root access. Maybe not really a solution.\n\nA: If you're looking to never rename your window, no matter where you connect from, you might want to change the setting in the remote machine. The thing that renames the window is the escape sequence \\033k, as described here\n\nBash users will probably want to echo the escape sequence in the\n  PROMPT_COMMAND:\nPROMPT_COMMAND='printf \"\\033k\\033\\134\"'\n\n\nIn this case, if you change the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable in your remote shell, it will stop renaming the window.\n", "Q: OS X El-Capitan - /cores directory taking up a lot of space? Im using a program called Daisy Disk to see what is taking up space in my Mac and I find that the /cores directory is taking up 77gb. \nIs that a problem? Can I get rid of it to regain the space?\n\n\nA: Long story short, it's safe to delete them.\nThe /cores folder is where OS X stores Core Dumps. These are files that are intended for developers to trouble-shoot and diagnose faults in their software. They are generated as software crashes. If you're not a developer, or aren't testing software for a developer, then these files serve no purpose for you.\nThe files contain the state of the memory (or RAM) in your Mac at the time the crash happened. So lots of useful information for developers or testers to debug crashes. Not much use to anyone else.\nBy default, OS X is set up not to generate core dump files. If you type sudo launchctl limit core in a Terminal window it will respond with the soft and hard size limits of dump files it is allowed to create. Soft limit means the default for each process, however processes can change this if they require but only up to the value of the hard limit. By default the values in OS X seem to be \"0 unlimited\" means that the operating system won't create core dumps by default, but processes can elect to have unlimited core dump files created if they wish.\nYou can change the setting on your machine by simply entering sudo launchctl limit core 0 0 to disable the feature entirely. sudo launchctl limit core 0 unlimited will restore the default behaviour if it has been changed.\n", "Q: Strange Clipboard behaviour on OS X El Capitan I've been experiencing a very weird clipboard behaviour on my mac.\nThis is my OS\n\nI'm a developer and every now and then I need to copy paste code, text or even files around.\nWhat I've been experiencing lately is that the clipboard is not being shared among applications.\nFor example I can't copy a url from Chrome and paste it into Safari. It doesn't give me any error, it just wont paste anything.\nFor example I just selected this page URL, but on the clipboard I see the URL dropbox added to my clipboard.\n\nAnother strange issue is that I use Sublime Text on a day to day basis, and sometimes if I need to copy and paste code somewhere else, it either wont paste anything at all or adds sometimes 10 new lines between each line of what I copied and sometimes 1000s of new lines in between. Which is very annoying.\nI've tried restarting the clipboard from the terminal and from Activity Monitor and still the same issue.\nSometimes when I quit and reopen sublime, the issue in sublime itself gets fixed but for a short period of time. It then comes back.\nI also use Alfred 2 for workflows and shortcuts which has a clipboard history, but when it starts happening it wont copy into it's clipboard either.\nSometimes copying and pasting works just with the mouse and sometimes not even with it.\nI've also tried repairing permissions, run Onyx and repair everything.\nUPDATE\nI recently tried rebooting in Recovery mode to repair permissions as well as clearing the NVRAM but I'm still experiencing the same thing.\nSo far the only solution I have found is a reboot, which makes it work for a while.\nAny clues?\n\nA: HO!

It is not lagging. It simply takes longer to respond as a little red colored wheel is turning where the cursor should be showing. I have not tried anything, because i do not know what to do. Any idea what I can do to speed up again?\n\nA: The first step is to make note of the date/time when you see slowdowns. Then you can start using Activity Monitor to see what programs are running, related, not related.\nAlso, make a brand new user account and log out of your slow account.\nTry reproducing the things that slow you down on the new account once you have some idea what causes it.\nAfter a week of paying attention, you'll be able to ask a follow on question with some specifics - is memory over committed, is it disk speed or network speed related? CPU busy? Lots of things to check, and hard to guess what you are seeing without specific data.\n", "Q: Equivalent of disabling services in Windows to lessen CPU/RAM usage for OS X? When it comes to the underside of things I know a lot more about Windows than Mac/OS X, so I'm not sure if OS X is even like this in this aspect but what I'm wanting to know is I used to very thoroughly disable system services in Windows for things I didn't need like network file sharing and quick user switching, just to name a couple, to make the computer run lighter.\nIt worked great on aging systems and I was wondering if there was an equivalent of such a thing for OS X that I could pick through and at my risk disable just to help my old Late 2006 iMac?\n\nA: OS X doesn't come with a bunch of unneeded services loaded in the background taking up resources. Most OSes are not as bloated as Windows. There really isn't anything to disable, unless you enabled something that you no longer need. OS X is pretty conservative with what it enables by default, and it often will enable things automatically as needed, and keep them disabled when not.\n", "Q: Wireless with 802.11r, 802.11k and 802.1x I was recommended to seek for assistance here from the Networking/Stack Exchange site towards OS X queries, do hope someone has the answers.\nHave El Capitan on a testing iMac and deploying 802.11r/k with FT-dot1x from a Cisco WLC showed no issues with wireless connectivity.

I would like to join Instagram and several other sites...but, living on social security, I can't afford a smart phone - it's not the phone it's the monthly service charge. So, my idea was to buy a used iPhone and use it wherever there is Wi-Fi for internet access.\nWould this work? Also could I use something like Skype or some other Apple program to make calls or would it be internet only?\n\nA: If you want an iPhone without the phone, Apple recently updated the iPod Touch with the internals of the iPhone 6. It still has only a 4-inch screen size, but with the updated hardware, it makes a decent iPhone without the phone. It costs $199 for the 16GB model, $249 for 32GB, $299 for 64GB, and $399 for 128GB.\n", "Q: How do i remove favorites folders from my ipad on ios 9.1? In my list of bookmarks, i have several empty folders labeled favorites. How do i get rid of these? The edit button doesnt allow it to be deleted. \n\nA: I bet you're also syncing your iCloud bookmarks to PC and didn't think it was relevant.\nI fixed this issue for myself earlier today by going into Chrome on my PC and deleting all the multiple \"Bookmarks Bar\" folders I found. It seems a new one was created any time a change was made in the iOS Favorites folder, and I guess when Chrome would then try to sync its own bookmarks back to iCloud, that's when it would create the duplicate folders on the iPad and iPhone.\nIf the issue comes back then I may just disable iCloud bookmark syncing on the PC entirely.\n\nA: It depends on where you are in Safari. If you're looking at the grid of favorites (like you would see when you open a new tab), you can tap and hold on the icons to delete them. \nIf you are looking at the list of favorites (like you would see when accessing your reading list with the book icon next to the address/search bar), the edit button should make a red circle with a line in the center appear. Tap that, and a red delete button should appear.\nIf neither of those are working for you, you may be experiencing a bug, though both of them work for me on my iPad (4th-gen) with iOS 9.1. Good luck!\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 keeps booting the OS X Utilities and won't accept our Apple ID Before the issue became my headache, one of our relatives created a partition on my MBP to keep their files.

I had messed about with my KeyChains (probably the likely factor in this issue).\nTo solve the issue I had to completely wipe my Macbook Air, set up El Capitan and iCloud again.\nBefore you attempt to do this, ensure that you have all of your data on backed up to an external drive, not a Time Machine backup. \nAs you can see below CloudKeychainProxy is now not hogging CPU cycles, and my battery life has dramatically improved.\n\n", "Q: Using El Capitan, why can't I install some dmg files I recently upgraded to El Capitan, and now I am finding I can't install certain software. For example, I needed to view WebEx. WebEx had me download a dmg, but when I clicked it to install, it opened briefly then failed silently.\nThen, my Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver told me I needed to restore Java 6 (even though I have Java 8 installed and it is backward compatible). I downloaded the correct Java 6 dmg, but again when I tried to install it aborted silently.\nI tried launching the dmg from the command line, but that doesn't seem to be recognized as an executable.\nFYI, I had selected under security \"Allow apps downloaded from Anywhere\"\n\nA: You are opening a DMG (Disk Image) file that is mounting a volume which contains the installer package to run.

Sometimes when I search using the title bar of Safari for a google search, I have to hit the return key twice. A single return will sometimes load search results, but not always. \nDeleted com.apple.Safari.plist from my Library folder as part of troubleshooting, but it's still occurring. \n\nA: I've been having this issue and it's started to drive me nuts. I think I've solved it by altering the search preferences for Safari and disabling most of the 'smart search' options. I've not spent the time going through each to determine which particular option caused the issue. I'm just glad I don't have to keep pressing return twice.\n\n\nA: That's a really strange phenomenon. I see two possiblities. Either your return key input isn't being registered because the quick search suggestions are slow when loading, or there's something wrong with your cache.\nI would try clearing all website data.\n\nNOTE: You'll have to log into all your accounts again, but this should help clear out the lag, making the browsing experience snappier in general once you're back up and running again.\n\nA: Not true, but it does seem that way at first glance.\nYour Safari 8/9 search will load after tapping enter once, but it won't show the loading bar until you tap enter a second time. It's just an unusual feature. If you don't tap enter twice, it will seem that your page isn't loading, but, if you just wait, it still loads.\n", "Q: Using Configurator 2, Prepare Device Without Changing iOS Version I essentially have an updated version of this question: How do I prepare a new device in Configurator without updating the device iOS?\nI have an iOS 9.0.2 device. I want to Prepare and Supervise it with Configurator 2, but do not want to update the device to iOS 9.1. With the old Configurator, this was possible (see answer to linked question).\nDoes anyone know if there is a similar way to do this with the new Configurator 2?\n\nA: It seems that the way Apple wants you to do this is described here:\n\nUpdate iOS beta software \n  You can use Apple Configurator 2 to install beta versions of iOS software.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*To install iOS beta software on a device, select the device in the    device browser and drag the .ipsw file onto the device.\n  \n\n\nHowever, the specific use case described is for beta versions of iOS. In my case, I wanted to install an older (than the newest public) version of iOS. It looks like the UI is the same for doing either. \nWhen I attempted to prepare my device this way, the process failed with error codes: \n\nPersonalization failed: 4027  \n  Personalization failed: 3194\n\nI am not clear whether this is because updating a device to less than the newest version is unsupported ... or there is some other problem. Therefore, I'm leaving this answer, but not accepting it as solved, should someone else have more to add.\n\nA: There's a terminal command you can run to fix the Personalization Failed error.

I'm trying to edit a script in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Mail. When I attempt to save from Script Editor I get The document \"Reply.scpt\" could not be saved. (Error -1,752). It doesn't seem to be a permissions issue because I can edit and save the file in BBEdit (it's a plain text file).\nI'm running Script Editor 2.8.1 under OS X 10.11.1 on a late 2015 iMac.\n\nA: The problem is that the file is a plain text file. When I originally created the file in 2007, Script Editor could apparently save uncompiled .scpt files. Now, however, as described  in Can't save AppleScript file when created by touch, .scpt files must be compiled. Uncompiled files can be saved with the .applescript extension.\nI know this is nearly a duplicate of the question linked above, but I added it because as of OS X 10.11 El Capitan Script Editor gives an error number for this problem. I couldn't find any other references to this error number so I thought it was worthwhile to get the error number in a question title.\n", "Q: iOS contacts issue I've got an odd thing going on with my contacts.

I have already tried changing the path setting \"LC_MESSAGES=es_ES.UTF-8 wine path_to_exe\" but it does not change anything.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There are many other locale variables besides LC_MESSAGES.\nTry doing the same for LANG and also for LC_ALL.\n", "Q: Remove disk image from the disk list In Disk Utility I see two disk images (Flash Updates)\n\nBut I cannot find where the image file could be.\nOn the console with diskutil I see\n/dev/disk2 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +16.9 MB    disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            16.9 MB    disk2s2\n/dev/disk4 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +17.2 MB    disk4\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk4s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Flash Player            17.1 MB    disk4s2\n\nAnd with diskutil info\n   Device Identifier:        disk4\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk4\n   Whole:                    Yes\n   Part of Whole:            disk4\n   Device / Media Name:      Apple UDIF read-only compressed (bzip2) Media\n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   File System:              None\n\n   Content (IOContent):      Apple_partition_scheme\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 Disk Image\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n\n   Total Size:               17.2 MB (17170432 Bytes) (exactly 33536 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          Yes\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Device Location:          External\n   Removable Media:          Yes\n   Media Removal:            Software-Activated\n\n   Virtual:                  Yes\n   OS 9 Drivers:             No\n   Low Level Format:         Not supported\n\nIs there a way to know where these images are on my disk?\n\nA: hdiutil will show information about all mounted DMGs:\nhwd@hwds-iMac:~$ hdiutil info  \nframework       : 415\ndriver          : 10.11v415\n================================================\nimage-path      : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageOne.dmg\nimage-alias     : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageOne.dmg\nshadow-path     : <none>\nicon-path       : /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework    /Resources/CDiskImage.icns\nimage-type      : UDIF, nur Lesen, komprimiert (bzip2)\nsystem-image    : false\nblockcount      : 22528\nblocksize       : 512\nwriteable       : false\nautodiskmount   : TRUE\nremovable       : TRUE\nimage-encrypted : false\nmounting user   : hwd\nmounting mode   : <unknown>\nprocess ID      : 5376\n/dev/disk2      Apple_partition_scheme  \n/dev/disk2s1    Apple_partition_map \n/dev/disk2s2    Apple_HFS   /Volumes/mountedImageOne\n================================================\nimage-path      : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageTwo.dmg\nimage-alias     : /Users/hwd/Downloads/mountedImageTwo.dmg\nshadow-path     : <none>\nicon-path       : /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages.framework/Resources/CDiskImage.icns\nimage-type      : UDIF, nur Lesen, komprimiert (zlib)\nsystem-image    : false\nblockcount      : 20480\nblocksize       : 512\nwriteable       : false\nautodiskmount   : TRUE\nremovable       : TRUE\nimage-encrypted : false\nmounting user   : hwd\nmounting mode   : <unknown>\nprocess ID      : 5416\n/dev/disk3      GUID_partition_scheme   \n/dev/disk3s1    48465300-0000-AAAA-AAAA-000000000000    /Volumes/mountedImageTwo\n\n\nA: The question is actually \"How to remove...\".\nIt can be ejected by using the device path\ndiskutil eject /dev/disk4\nSubstitute disk4 for whichever disk is offensive.\n\nA: Mount them through Disk Utility and you will see them in Finder where you can just unmount them by clicking on the eject icon in the sidebar next to their names (in Finder) and they will disappear.\n", "Q: Disable text box with preedit text when using an input source and searching in Finder \nThis text box appears when I'm using a different input source than English, and quick search in any file list.

I used to use an app called Afloat that let me pin windows on top of all other windows on the Desktop. However, Afloat stopped being maintained at some point and it doesn't work with more recent versions of OS X.\nI then used an app called Compulsion, which installed as a SIMBL plugin but then that stopped working with OS X El Capitan.\nIs there a way to get either of these apps to work with OS X El Capitan? Or is there another solution I can try?\n\nA: I suggest trying kwm https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm\nFrom my experience, the whole intention of having one window always on top is to read/compare/reference to it while working on another app.\n\"Tiled window manger\" solutions works much better for this purpose. After having tried Athethyst https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst, I came to kwm. I find kwm offers a better way of configuration. It relies on a config file. After installation, which takes a bit more work then Amethyst, and reading through the sample config file, you already feel yourself a poweruser already. So It's worth to try.\nA note though, when I start doing advanced fancy configuration, kwm starts having quite some hiccups.\nEdit: kwm is now called yabai https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai\n\nA: Try using Helium.  It uses a 'customizable translucency' to keep a window on top of other windows.  Plus, it won't intercept mouse clicks on top of it unless you want it to.\nAs of now, it only supports a browser window but the question doesn't indicate if that's a requirement of the OP or not.\nEDIT Feb 2022: Original link is dead.  I'm linking to the author's GitHub page here for Helium can't determine if the project is still being updated.\n", "Q: New disk on MacBook, how can I install OS X I recently change my hard disk for ssd on my Macbook 7.1.

So how can I completely remove com.displaylink.displaylinkmanager?\n\nA: Just download app again from this link, open the installer file, then select uninstall from there :)\nhttp://www.displaylink.com/downloads/osx\n\nA: From version 1.1 on, the uninstaller is only included with the login screen extension. You can download it using the link in the dropdown box that appears when you click the DisplayLink icon in the menu bar, or use this direct link.\n\nAn uninstaller is included on the downloaded DMG.\n\n\nA: In a Terminal, run locate displaylinkmanager and you should get a list with all files containing \"displaylinkmanager\".\nThen run rm file, replace file with each file from the previous command. This will delete the files, and hopefully fix the confusion that causes your program to crash.\n\nA: The displaylink-debian.sh (in my case) lives in /usr/bin\nsudo displaylink-debian.sh uninstall and follow the instructions. All those having issues with \"Missing component: Linux headers for running kernel, 4.9.0-6-amd64.\" should use this as well, you will receive the same error but it appears to continue with the uninstall to completion. \n\nA: Just quit DisplayLink Manager from the tray icon.

I'm using El Capitan 10.11.1 and Photos app 1.2\nThe new version of the the Photos app allows you to update the metadata for photos via the 'Get Info' menu option.  For a single photo, you can update the timestamp by opening the Info inspector, and double clicking the date/time.\nThe resulting Adjust date and time of selected photos dialog strongly implies that you should be able to do this for multiple photos at once.  It says:\n\n\"The original date and time of your first photo is shown below.  Adjust it to the correct time, and all 1 photos will be time-shifted accordingly.\"\n\nSo... I have about 100 photos I need to do this to, but if I select them all (or any number greater than 1), the Info inspector changes subtly - the timestamp changes format from e.g. \"11 November 2015 12:11\" to simply \"11 Nov 2015\", and double clicking the date now does nothing except select the date in the Info inspector.\nIs it possible to shift the date/time of my 100 photos within the Photos app?\n\nA: Select the photos you want, then select the menu command \"Image\" -> \"Adjust Date and Time...\" which pops up the window that you are looking for. It seems as though it also gives control over the time zone for images with location data.\nWhen adjusting the date/time of a group of photos, you adjust the date for one of the images, and all the other images time stamp is changed by the same amount, enabling you to correct for time zone shifts or improperly set camera date/time issues, rather than making the time/date of all the photos identical.\n", "Q: Can I transfer my TextMate 2 settings to another Mac? I am switching to a new Mac and want to bring my TextMate 2 settings with me from my old Mac. I don't see an obvious way to do this, and searching hasn't brought anything up. Do I really need to re-set everything up again from scratch?\nOr is there a way to export/copy TextMate 2 preferences/settings from one computer to another?  Thanks!\n\nA: I've managed to get pretty far on my own, so I'm posting an answer.  If someone else has a better way, I'll be glad to accept their answer.  I ran into some gotchas along the way, so I wanted to share those as well.  Here are the steps I took.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure TextMate is not running on your new Mac.\n\n*On your old Mac, tar up the TextMate and Avian folders under ~/Library/Application Support:\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n$ tar cfz TextMate.tgz TextMate\n$ tar cfz Avian.tgz Avian\n\n(You may or may not have the Avian directory.  If not, skip instructions related to that.)\n\n\n*Copy those two tar files to your new Mac and place them under ~/Library/Application Support, and then extract them:\n\n\n$ cp TextMate.tgz ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n$ cp Avian.tgz ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n$ tar xfz TextMate.tgz\n$ tar xfz Avian.tgz \n\n\n\n*Copy the TextMate .plist files from ~/Library/Preferences on your old Mac over to the same locations on your new Mac.  For me this was the following two files:\n\n\n$ cd ~/Library/Preferences\n$ ls | grep -i textmate\ncom.macromates.TextMate.preview.LSSharedFileList.plist\ncom.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist\n$\n\n\n\n*(Here is the 'gotcha' which took me awhile to figure out.)  You need to unquarantine the files you just copied over to your new Mac.  Do this (on your new Mac) by clearing the extended attribute com.apple.quarantine as follows:\n\n\n$ cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\n$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine Avian\n$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine TextMate\n$ cd ~/Library/Preferences\n$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine com.macromates.TextMate.*\n\nThe -r and -d options to xattr say to handle all files in those directories (recursive) and delete the attribute specified.  If you get a bunch of permission errors, place sudo in front of the xattr commands.\nThe above appears to have restored the majority of the TextMate \"behaviors\" from my old Mac to my new Mac.  I still had to open up the TextMate -> Preferences menu and do a side-by-side comparison, checking and unchecking boxes for various settings that did not transfer over with the above steps.\nUpdate:\nIf you have a .tm_properties file, e.g., ~/.tm_properties, you'll also want to copy that over to your new Mac.\n\nA: TextMate 2, which is still in Beta, places its Preferences Settings in /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.TextMate.preview.plist although I suspect that \"preview\" will be dropped from the filename once it goes gold. Copying this file to a different User/System should, to the proper location, transfer the Preferences Settings.\n", "Q: Why is there a command-1 on top of my terminal window?

I am using Mac OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan.\nHow do I permanently modify my $PATH to cut down the default values Apple ships?\n\nA: .bash_profile and .bashrc do not have to exist for $PATH to work, they're for bash configuration. According to the bash docs,\n\nWhen Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.

I have sized this ssd to store everything but the data in my User folder, and will be following the setup (not installation) instructions found here.  My question is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does moving everything but the content of my user folder ensure that my Parallels based installation of Windows 7 runs from the SSD?\n\n*Will all programs installed on the Windows side be run from the SSD?\n\n\nIf not, how do I go about achieving this?\n\nA: The setup proposed in the setup guide provides a dual-drive environment with a \"swapped\" system. The faster SSD finally contains the system, some user folders and all apps and the slower but larger HDD contains your user data.\nIf your Windows Parallels VM is stored in your user folder (the default path is /User/[username]/Documents/Parallels.../) it will run from the HDD. But you can add a folder with your user name in /Users and move the VM image to it or move it to /Users/Shared/.\nAfter deleting the VM from your HDD user folder open Parallels and relink the Windows VM to the VM list.

Last year, I had to update 100 iPad to iOS 8. I did them one at a time and it took forever.\nWe use AirWatch as our MDM.\nIs there a better way to update them all?\n\nA: Yes. You'll want to look at caching server on OS X to avoid downloading 100 copies of the software image and either ground control or Apple Configurator 2. Both can be highly automated and scripted and will re-enroll the devices into your MDM once the job is done.\n", "Q: u flag with ps command According to the Mac man page for ps it says for the -u flag:\n-u      Display the processes belonging to the specified usernames.\n\nHowever, it seems to display different information rather than just being attached to usernames.

So I need to get my boyfriends cell number but I don't have it memorized.

Log in with your iCloud/AppleID account information and you can see your contacts on the website.\nSimilarly, if your iPhone syncs contacts with http://gmail.com/ or http://outlook.com/ or some other provider, you could use a web browsers to log onto your account at that website and see your contacts thusly.\n", "Q: Client SSL certificate failing in Safari (and what is SOSCCThisDeviceIsInCircle?) I'm having difficulty using an X.509 certificate to do client authentication from Safari (9.0.1, as on OS X 10.10.5).\nThe symptom is that I go to a https://... site which does client certificate checking, but Safari appears to simply hang as if it were waiting from a response from the server.  In the error console it reports Failed to load resource: cancelled (and on one of the servers I've tried this with, which I have control over, the relevant logs report that the browser appeared to abruptly close the connection – there's no other indication there of a protocol botch).\nThe certificate is valid and has a good CA signature, as verified by openssl, and by the fact that it works as expected with Firefox, Chrome, and curl.  Note that Chrome and OS X curl do use the Keychain, and Firefox doesn't, so there's no common factor there.  Also, OS X curl is built against SecureTransport as opposed to OpenSSL, so is, I think, using the same SSL library as Safari (I don't know about Chrome in this respect).\nThis isn't a server-side problem, because others using the same version of Safari can get to the same URL with certificates from the same CA.  Also, I can connect straightforwardly to that site using Chrome, which of course also uses WebKit, and which uses the same certificate, via the Keychain.\nThe nearest thing to a diagnostic I can find is that a message appears in the Console whenever I do this, saying\n2015-11-13 18:43:53.329 Keychain Access[1373]:  SOSCCThisDeviceIsInCircle SOSCCThisDeviceIsInCircle!! 58\n\n(the final number increments each time).\nI have been able to find nothing at all relating to that string, apart from passing mentions in a few clearly puzzled forum posts.\nI have tried deleting identity preferences from Keychain Access without success, tried deleting similar (expired) certificates from the keychain, and tried exporting deleting and re-importing the relevant certificate; all without effect.\nI'm stumped!  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Since this appears to be a Safari-specific problem, I'm asking here before trying on the security SE.\n\nA: I like to use the Keychain Access app to troubleshoot cryptographic trust issues and also find making a clean VM of OS X or at least a new user account helps to make sure I know I'm starting from a known trust chain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access\n\n*under the Keychain Access menu, select Certificate Assistant and then Evaluate a Certificate\n\n\nFrom there you can use the SSL tool to evaluate things and start to pick apart what is failing or succeeding. Bouncing between that tool and Safari usually is worthwhile in sorting errors.\n\nA: Herewith a non-answer:\nIt appears that this is not a general certificate or trust issue, but a Safari-related bug which, despite some efforts, I've not been able to narrow down beyond that (I'm currently using Safari 9.1.2 on OS X 10.10.5).\nThe certificate in question fails to work with multiple sites (including the website of its own issuer), but the same certificate works consistently with those sites when used with Chrome (which also uses Keychain Access) or Firefox (which doesn't).\nSo if you're looking at this because you have the same problem (and I'm adding this answer because Stackexchange has just told me, to my surprise, that this question has now been viewed over 1000 times), then my advice is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a different browser; and\n\n*If you can narrow this down any more, then very well done (and thank you), and please consider submitting a bug report about it – the world will then be in your debt.\n\n", "Q: Dragging a file between desktops in El Capitan Say you have 5 desktops open in Mission Control in El Capitan.\nIf you select a file to drag it to an app or another folder which lies in a different desktop, Mission Control always takes you to desktop 1 (far left).\nCan you fix this somehow?\nIt was ok with all previous versions.\n\nA: It would appear you have the Finder assigned to a specific Space. Right click it & see what it says in Options [as in the picture below, it will only show a specific number if it is assigned to a Space you're not currently on - otherwise will just show All/This/None]\n\nThe quickest way to carry any file to another Space is to hold it then invoke the key command for the Space you need - by default  Ctrl ⌃   [num] \nThis also works for any Application window.\nThe key commands are automatically added each time you make a new Space, but are not switched on by default.

My computer never crashed before I got an external monitor, so I suspect that the monitor might be related to the issue.\nI have a 2010 Macbook Pro hooked up to a Samsung 23\" LED Monitor using a HDMI - MiniDisplay Port. Sometimes when I am working on my computer, the computer will suddenly crash. When I say crash, I mean sometimes my external monitor will be completely purple and my Macbook screen will be black, other times they will both be black, and even both screen can be white. So when my computer crashes, the color always changes and is unpredictable. I can't do anything with my computer at this point. There is never a feeling of lag from the computer and the fan is usually quiet. There is no hardware sound when the screen flashes to a solid color. From there, I usually end up hold on to the power button to force shut down the computer. When I restart the computer, there is no error dialogue or anything indicating the computer crashed.\nSo I'm not sure what is causing the issue, but I suspect it has something to do with my external monitor.

When I try the old one, the app starts but no contact is shown.\nI tried clearing spotlight data (block my drive and then unblock it). The contacts first were absent, but soon they reappeared. I guess somewhere on my drive there is a data file which stores the old contacts, but the contacts.app can't access it.\nHow can I find this file and remove it?

How do I save all of my iBooks pdfs, located on my iPad2, to an external hard drive?\n\nA: I'm not going to post the church boy answer, but if you jailbreak your device, you will have full access to the file system.\nThere is probably a legitimate way to do this without jailbreaking, but having jailbroken devices myself, I would simply enable SSH (the root password is alpine, which you should change immediately) and either rsync or scp the files to your external hard drive volume (which in my case is mounted on a Mac Mini (also running sshd).  The hard drive will be mounted in /Volumes.\nI forget the exact path to your Camera Roll, but the main directory you are looking for containing the photos and videos is DCIM.\nIf your external drive is a Windows computer, then there are also tools in Cydia that make file sharing with Windows a breeze.  Or if you're like me and have to run Cygwin with sshd on all of your Windows boxes, the same rules as above would apply, but the path to the external drive would be /cygdrive/[drive letter].\nIf you are on a Mac and enable SSH to your iPad, just do the following in Terminal on your Mac (if it is a Mac):\ncd /Volumes/[external drive]/[folder to store images]\nscp root@[iPad IP address]:/path/to/DCIM/* .\n\nIt would be a good idea to use screen for this job so that it doesn't fail from a broken pipe in case you have a lot of images.  If you want to go that route, you could do something like this screen -LS image.copy which would put you in a new shell session.  Then run the commands above, and detach from the session with Ctrl+A-D.  This lets the process run in the background.  If you want to come back later and check the progress, run screen -x image.copy.\nIf you are going to do something like this, you should make sure that you are hooked up to power and don't have auto-lock set, or else it will end your session prematurely.\nThis may be a horrible answer, but I always default to command line, because it never fails me.\n", "Q: iOS 7 update not shown in Software Update When I try to update my iOS 6.1.6 it says it's up to date and it's been like that for five months.

I was recently visiting apples iphone site and man they have a LOT of images in high resolution there. But when scanning the site to see how much MB I actually load I was stunned! All these images made up only 1. 4MB which is incredible. For example look at this picture here from the Apple Website:\nhttp://images.apple.com/v/iphone/home/r/home/images/iphone_workshops_6s_xlarge.jpg\nThis high resolution image is only 182 KB big I cant get such results in Photoshop when saving jpegs. I mean you can clearly see that the details are kinda smudged so I am guessing this wasnt edited the normal way.\nDoes somebody have an explanation for that compression and maybe a tutorial how to achieve such low sizes? I am a web developer and when I create website with slideshows where I usually use image sizes like 1920 x 400 or something similar I never get images which are under 500-800 KB\n\nA: A full-on image compression explanation is probably better suited for StackOverflow, but since you related it to Apple, I'll give an overview here. \nThe image itself actually determines the size of its file to an extent. With that, one can compress some images more than others without losing much apparent quality. For example, the JPEG image compression algorithm handles reds poorly. Consequently, if you have a photo with more red, you will likely need to keep the JPEG quality higher in order to not notice a difference. There are other quirks with different image compression formats that can impact the size of the file as well. \nSecond is how you save the file. Photoshop has a Save for Web feature that allows you to have more granular control over the save quality of the image. You can adjust the quality percentage (of original) and immediately see the affects on the photograph. A commenter noticed that it was 58% image quality. That doesn't mean it's 58% of the original file size, but is the number associated with the algorithm. It is likely that just that is less than 58% of the original size of the photo. You can easily see what they described by saving a photo in Photoshop using Save for Web and then setting it to the JPEG format and setting the quality to 58%. \nAfter the photo has been saved, there is still another level of compression that can be done - in fact, there is more than one. The simplest, perhaps, is to run it through an image compressor. There are many out there and the one stand-alone app that comes to mind is JPEG-Mini. These can reduce file size significantly in some cases (though not all). You can also configure the server to provide a gzipped version of the image which further reduces the size. (You can determine if that photo was gzipped by looking at the headers for that image request/response.) \nImage compression is extremely important, but is unfortunately overlooked all too often. I appreciate sites that show that their developers have done what they could to reduce image size so that all of their users can enjoy a faster load time. On that topic, responsive images are rapidly becoming supported and are sure to bring an even better UX as we serve browsers more specific content. \n", "Q: OSX crashes and reboots several hours after going to \"sleep\" (lid closed) I have a MacBook Pro as my work laptop. When I go home, I close the lid and take the laptop with me. Very often, the next time I open my laptop I find that the OS restarted \"because of a problem\". This reboot may happen several hours after the lid is closed, as the sound from my laptop back indicates.\nWhat is the best way to understand / debug why this is happening? Can I get some useful information from log files?\n\nThe laptop is MacBookPro11,3, with Intel Core i7 processor, and 16 GB of RAM. The programs that are usually running before crash are iTerm, Finder, Microsoft Outlook, and Chrome. I also run a Vagrant VM with a bunch of processes in it for work. My coworkers run exactly the same codebase and none of them is having the same problem.\n\nA: In my case the issue was related exactly to VMWare. Before putting my laptop to sleep I suspend the VM and the issue doesn't happen. That's a \"pause\" button in the VMWare UI.\n\nEdit:\nLooks like VMWare sleep functionality is buggy. I once got my entire VM getting to the point of no return. I simply use vagrant suspend these days before putting my laptop to sleep. No need to bring up VMWare UI.\n", "Q: Where do closed notes in OS X Notes app go? When you close a note in the OS X 10.9 Notes app it leaves no trace, there's no warning and no revert. It's just appears to be gone. Very unMac like to me. It's in user interface design 101 that if there's a risk of data loss, the application should inform the user of this is what will happen.\nWhere do the notes go in OS X if the default is \"on this Mac\"? What if the default account is an IMAP account? Can you get it back from the place it's connected to?\n\nA: Well, this seem to be down to my unfamiliarity with the Notes app. As in \"Mail\" there is a browser overview under Window > Notes (Cmd-0) (in my language anyway) and any closed notes can be found there. \nDespite a long long use of OS X apps this didn't feel like a natural place to look, but it's logical considering other Apple apps. I think possibly \"Note browser\" would have said more about the function of this menu option. I must have understood this as a reference to the app itself.\n", "Q: Xcode 7.1.1 opens up as Xcode 7.0.1 I updated my Xcode to 7.1.1 (it said so in the Mac App Store).\nWhen I click on \"Open\", Xcode 7.0.1 showed up instead of Xcode 7.1.1.\nDo I need OSX El Capitan to run Xcode 7.1.1 ?\nIn the past, I had Xcode 7.1 Beta 2 installed, I wonder if that caused some files to be corrupted.\nSeems like someone else had a similar problem here: Updated XCode to 7.0.1 via the app store but it still shows itself at 6.4 in the app and missing the new features \nThe answer there recommended deleting all copies of Xcode and reinstall from scratch.\nI'll download OS X El Capitan to see if it fixes it before I decide to nuke Xcode to oblivion on my computer and redownload it all again\nUpdate 1:\nUpdated my laptop to Mac OS X El Capitan but didn't fix it either. Xcode still start up as Xcode 7.0.1 =/\nI guess it's time to nuke Xcode.\n\nA: If you are tired downloading Xcode from the App Store or searching for old Xcode.apps somewhere hidden on your volumes, go to Developer Apple Downloads, enter a valid Apple ID and password and download Xcode 7.1.1.dmg (direct link) and any other tool you need to code or debug.\nRemove any Xcode.app in your /Applications folder, open the dmg and copy Xcode to your /Applications folder.\n", "Q: How can I use Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 with late 2011 MBP? I have a MBP 17\" (late 2011) and would like to use the new Magic input devices (Keyboard, Mouse 2, and Trackpad 2) with it which seem to rely on Bluetooth 4. How can I connect them to my MBP?\n\nA: You could just use it wired, meaning connect the lightning cable that is usually used to charge the pad to connect it to your MacBook, it works.\nSome people tried using it with older Macs and it seems to work with Bluetooth 2.0 as well, but i doubt the battery will last as long as with Bluetooth 4.0.\nThe chip in the device itself is only capable of Bluetooth 3, but Apple never sold Bluetooth 3, they went from 2.0+EDR directly to 4.\nYou will however need El Capitan, without that it won't recognize the device.\n\nA: I can offer that the Magic Trackpad 2 works with my mid-2011 iMac, although as was suggested, the battery life on it is reduced from the promised month down to a bit less than two weeks per full charge.\nAlso, I am encountering a problem which may or may not be related to this unsupported configuration. Occasionally, I'll tap on a window in the background, and El Capitan will bring the window to the foreground, but the previous application's window will retain focus, causing keyboard input to be directed seemingly to the wrong application.\nI did not have this particular problem with the original Magic Trackpad. I also didn't see it if I use the Magic Trackpad 2 plugged in instead of wireless, although I didn't fully test that configuration.\nSubsequent testing with my Magic Trackpad 2 plugged in continues to show the same problem, so it's not Bluetooth-related.\n", "Q: Test apps on iPhone A new function in Xcode 7 is that I can test my apps on iOS devices without a paid developer account.\nIt works fine on my iPad air, but when I try it out with my iPhone 5s I'll always get some kind error message.\nI have tried with multiple Apple-ID's, and i have restored my iPhone (from a backup)\nI have tried with one of my friend's iPad to, and it worked fine.\nI hope some of you can help me.\nUpdate\nThe error message Xcode gives when trying to install an app on the iPhone.\n\n\nA: Turns out the issue was relating to the name of the device, I solved it by changing the device name from an unsupported, blank(￼), Unicode character. \n", "Q: iTunes updated my iPhone 5c to 9.1 but now iTunes on my PC wont connect to my phone I have updated my iPhone 5c to iOS 9.1\nWhen I try to connect it to my iTunes Library I get a message that the iPhone can't be used as it requires a newer version of iTunes. \niPhone and iTunes are both up to date.\nI'm using Windows Vista.\n\nA: Your version of iTunes is unlikely to be up to date [currently 12.3.1], as the latest version requires a minimum OS of Windows 7.\nYour only real solution would appear to be to upgrade your OS.\n\nWindows System Requirements  \nHardware:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*PC with a 1GHz Intel or AMD processor with support for SSE2 and 512MB of RAM  \n  \n*To play standard definition video from the iTunes Store, an Intel Pentium D or faster processor, 512MB of RAM and a DirectX 9.0-compatible video card are required.  \n  \n*To play 720p HD video, an iTunes LP or iTunes Extras, a 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor, 1GB of RAM and an Intel GMA X3000, ATI Radeon X1300 or NVIDIA GeForce 6150 or better are required.  \n  \n*To play 1080p HD video, a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor, 2GB of RAM and an Intel GMA X4500HD, ATI Radeon HD 2400 or Nvidia GeForce 8300 GS or better are required.  \n  \n*Screen resolution of 1024x768 or greater; 1280x800 or greater is required to play an iTunes LP or iTunes Extras  \n  \n*16-bit sound card and speakers  \n  \n*Broadband Internet connection to use Apple Music, the iTunes Store and iTunes Extras  \n  \n*iTunes-compatible CD or DVD recorder to create audio CDs, MP3 CDs, or back-up CDs or DVDs.

The days of gaming are long a distant memory. I haven't touched games since 12 years of age. These days, my notebook is used for computational and mathematical modelling.\nThat said, I do enjoy an occasional gaming session during the holidays.\nHere's the spec of my notebook:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n2.7 GHz Intel Core i5\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\nCan it run SC Legacy of the Void?\n\nA: Yes. Purchase it here. Google is your friend, 2pionfour.\nDisclosure: no financial stake in Blizzard Entertainment.\n\nA: StarCraft 2 works great on the Macbook Pro Mid 2015. I get around 100+fps currently on all low settings on 1280 x 960 resolution. One thing I notice is that the fan gets loud when using OpenGL. Using Metal API although in Beta doesn't even stress out the fan based on my experience.\nMy specs are:\n\n\nA: I don't see why not. \nYour computer specs seems to fit the minimum system requirement for a Mac.\n\nYou probably want to turn all your graphics quality to the lowest if you're experiencing lagginess.\nExtra note:\nIf you've never installed Starcraft 2 before, you'll likely need to download 7 to 20 GB of game contents. I hope you got unlimited internet download quota and a high speed internet.\nBlizzard and a number of other game companies are moving to making games where the disc is just an installer and the game contents are downloaded from servers.\nThey don't seem to put the latest game content patches etc on the disc anymore.\nDisc 2 of Starcraft 2 Legacy of the Void is completely empty when I put it into my DVD drive, no joke. It's a sad state for the gaming community.

Type `help' for help.\n\",\n \"> Shutting down.\n\"\n\nI have messed around with PATH and .bash_profile to no avail. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: It's most likely due to the VLC RC client wanting an Xterm interactive shell instead of a non-interactive shell, or some weirdness with the VLC OS X app still attempting to launch (It's bouncing in my dock while it runs).\nIn any case, a simple work around is to have automator launch a script to run in terminal.\nThe script would be simply:\n#/bin/bash\n/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I rc http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/select/mediaset/http-icy-mp3-a/vpid/bbc_radio_fourfm/format/pls.pls --sout '#standard{mux=raw,access=file{overwrite},dst=/Users/person/Documents/scripts/r4.mp3,display=novideo}' --run-time=1800 --stop-time=1800\n\nIt should have execute permissions (chmod +x)\nThen from Automator, you launch it like you normally would. In this case, I had Automator \"Run Shell Script\" of\nopen -a Terminal /path/to/script.sh\n\nNote you may want to add the --play-and-exit option, otherwise VLC will stay open even after the 1800 seconds. By default, it will stop at the end of the playlist and wait. --play-and-exit will tell it to quit when the playlist ends (in this case a single file).\nAlternatively, you can directly launch the script with a double click, skipping Automator completely, if you change the suffix to .command. That may be more direct, depending on your actual goal.\n\nA: I just want to record the radio at scheduled times.\nThis seems to do this trick for me, just as you suggested:\nopen -a Terminal /Users/me/Documents/scripts/r4.sh\n\nIt does fire up its own Terminal window, which I was hoping to avoid, but I can live with that. \nThank you.\n", "Q: Write ntfs file system in el capitan I have a hard disk which is in NTFS.\nI want to make it writable without formatting.\nI have gone through some solution for it but its working in previous version not in el captian.\nI tried this link\nbut when doing this step \nsudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original \nsudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs\n\nits says its not permitted.\n\nA: It is writeable when you use a ntfs driver: it is not the disk but the OSX that you should \"help\".\n There are several: the most experienced (in my opinion) are Tuxeira NTFS (opensource) and Paragon NTFS. Lately Tuxeira is the fastest update when the OSX is updated/upgraded.\n\nA: I recommend you to use 3rd party softwares for this job like Paragon NTFS, Tuxeria NTFS.\n", "Q: Launch a sh program at startup attached to a terminal window How is it possible to load (with terminal attached window) sh program at OSx startup ?\nI see a lot of article on launchctl but it's obviously not possible to open a terminal windows attached to the process. Specifically I am looking to run a specific script which is in the sh file (call for a python program. I have to see the echo / print of the program, so to have a terminal attached to the execution).\n\nA: Your use case is simple enough to just save your script to a file named with the .command file extension so that Terminal.app is chosen to open it. It needs to be user executable as well. Simply add that file to the user's Login Items in System Preferences.\nThe script is invoked with  an ; exit tacked on to the end so you can see and copy the results before dismissing that window each time you login.\n\n", "Q: Crazy \"System\" traffic data - What to do? ios 9 - iphone 6s I have a very limited data amount (only 1 Gb of 3G / 4G) per month\nSo natrually I took all the steps in order to limit my data drainage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Wi-Fi assist\n\n*Only five applications have access to cellular data traffic.

In that, I have a \"General\" amount equal to 359 Mb, 15.6 Mb of game center (! I never use it!) and 36 Mb of iTunes. \nI want to disable all of that! What to do? Can somebody help?\n\nA: I would look at which Apps are allowed to use Background App Refresh, in Settings > General & also possibly in Settings > iTunes & App Store what is allowed to download over Mobile data.\nA third possibility is iOS updates themselves, which cannot be prevented; the best workaround for those is to always update on the day of release, through iTunes, rather than let the update download to the phone.\n\nA: You don't have a neat switch to disable system data usage, but you can nip at the edges.\nFirst, Game Center can be caused by the GC app as well as by games that make calls to game center on your behalf. I would sign out go Game Center entirely and see if that lowers the requests. You might have to delete the games that call against Game Center also.\nThen you can reset the cellular statistics and keep a log of the items you use throughout the day and then review the cellular usage for system at the end of the day.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> Cellular -> Reset Statistics\n\n*Settings -> Cellular -> turn off Game Center and other items you never want to go over cellular data.\nYou can also turn off cellular entirely and see which apps complain the loudest about it. Lastly, I would go to notifications and remove all notifications from your lock screen that could use notifications over cellular. That will save battery as well as cellular data out of proportion to what you might expect (from my experience at least). It's tedious, but then adding in just the notifications you really need makes things much better.\n\nA: iCloud>iCloud drive... this guy consumes data silently...

Or you'll need a service to do this for you - Apple's Find My Mac service through iCloud is but one option there.\nIf you go the host file or DNS option, from terminal, use the host command to see what is resolving:\nhost hostname.synology.me\n\nYou might be able to get bonjour to work as well. This is more complicated - since the host tool and some others don't handle bonjour well.\nList the SMB mounts that bonjour has found on the local network:\ndns-sd -B _smb\n\nYou need to use control + C to cancel the browse command. Take the names at the end of the listing and put them in quotes if they have spaces or other punctuation in the names. Get the local name for the service:\ndns-sd -L \"Epson Stylus NX430\" _smb\n\nThat will show you the bonjour name and what local host name and port to communicate to the SMB server in question.

I am currently using OS X with a Standard user that has no admin privileges in the OS GUI. \nNote: My Standard user does however have sudo permissions in /etc/private/sudoers. This enables password protection when doing critical tasks in Terminal, while retaining flexibility.\nFor everyday use in the OS GUI, I keep a separate admin account.

Why/Why not?\n\n*What are the risks associated with this setup?\n\n\nA: Yes, the less your user can do, the less it can break. You can easily choose a short admin user name and use an easy to type password for doing admin things. \nIt really depends on your threat model and how expensive tech-support is for you and your organization and whether you have data that's worth protecting. You can surely run admin users and use something like Time Machine combined with periodic off-site or off-line backups so that if you should lose data or have a system compromise, you can plan for how long it will take to restore your system to before it was changed. \nYour permissions and planning seem prudent and I don't see any downside to your set up. \n", "Q: Which running/biking apps (Strava, Runtastic, Endomondo, ...) use barometer for proper elevation gain?

You didn't say what version of iOS you're running so you may have to poke around the settings a bit as Apple has changed how you do resets and what is affected. Make sure you have a back up of the phone first. With some of the new iOS versions, you can reset network settings before resetting all settings. I don't recall having to erase all data, so I believe you can skip that one. Again, please make sure you have a current backup!\nWith the iPhone5, if I recall correctly, you can press and hold both the power and home screen buttons for a few seconds which will also cause a reset.\nAfter you try each step, I suggest just trying to download one or two updates at a time to make sure that will work. And I suggest being on a wireless network you have tested.\nHTH,\n\nA: there is an option on iOS devices allow the user to upgrade new apps in the background.

Since I can access the data in Windows and Data, I can copy it (although it goes horribly slow) but what about TimeMachine, is there any way of accessing it if the system says it can't mount it?\nI want to copy its contents and then format the whole drive to see if everything gets back to normal.\nAny additional info needed, just ask.\n\nA: This sounds like it could be a failing hardware component.  \nSwap any connectors, try with a different cable, etc. IF this is a some major brand usb 3.0 external drives have internal usb 3.0 connectors fail frequently. Try it with a usb 2.0 micro cable and it may work fine at a slower speed.  If an external drive, you may be able to put into a drive dock to avoid issues with the factory housing and connectors.  \nAs soon as you get a stable connection, use the dd command, or something like daemon tools or 7 zip or whatever compression tool you prefer to dump the contents of each partition you don't want to lose to an iso to attempt recovery from later.  This is assuming you have another drive with sufficient capacity.  Let this complete before doing anything else so if the drive itself fails you have something to fall back to.\nIf you don't have any backup media, a clonezilla live cd could let you see the partition table really looks like and whether a filesystem to attempt to repair is still detected.\nConsider the exFAT format for drives that need to walk in both worlds, and use a single hardware drive for TimeMachine if possible.  It has not worked well with multi partitioned drives in my experience, although it is a fantastic backup solution. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Windows 7 Windows Explorer can't see iPhone 5S any more I used to be able to access my iPhone directly from Windows Explorer under Windows 7, can't now. iTunes can see the phone, Windows 7 Explorer can't. \nIs there any known fix?\n\nA: Check device manager to see if the iphone is listed, or if you have anything with a question or exclamation mark.\nEdit- also check disk management (just type diskmgmt.msc on start menu and press enter, or into windows + R run box and press enter) to see if the drive is possibly detected without a letter assigned.\n", "Q: How do I delete useless Apple Apps on OSX? I tried using terminal with sudo or su, while I do rm -rf to Photos.app, Chess.app, Mail.app, DVD Player.app, iBooks.app, but it said Operation not permitted.\nHow can I delete these apps?\n(OS X version is 10.11.1)\n\nA: Being OS X El Capitan (10.11) has, from what I understand, the same System Integrity Protection as the current version, macOS High Sierra (10.13), I think the steps are the same. You can delete at least some of the applications. I haven't tried them all but I deleted Maps, Chess and DVD Player.\nFirst, you need to boot into Recovery Mode. Hold CMD + R after the boot chime. From there you can go into the Terminal and type csrutil disable. Reboot. This disables System Integrity Protection and is not recommended to keep disabled. If you want to live on the edge though, go for it.\nAfter booting back into OS X/macOS I was able to sudo rm -rf <Application Path> without any errors.\nYou can always re-enable SIP after you make your changes.\nNote 1: I deleted iTunes once but a system update later put it back on.\nNote 2: You cannot easily get deleted applications back because you cannot download them, to my knowledge.\nNote 3: If you are just sick of looking at them in Finder, you can hide them by adding a hidden flag to the folder. SIP has to be disabled for this too. I used sudo chflags hidden /Applications/App\\ Store.app/ to hide the App Store from Finder.\nNote 4: Certain OS features may depend on apps being present so be wary of what you delete.\n", "Q: MacBook erased by thieves but still shows on FMM My MacBook Pro was stolen yesterday and I received an email that it was being erased. FMM now shows it was locked. It went online twice and I was able to see the approximative address. I wasn’t able to do anything because the only option on FMM was the sound—all others are greyed out. Does this mean that my Mac is locked and it rendered useless to the thieves? Is there a way they can unlock it without going to the Apple store to reset it? I alerted the police but so far they have not done anything about it.\n\nA: To answer your actual questions, if they did not erase the hard drive and you did not encrypt it using FileVault, they could simply reboot in Recovery Mode and open a root terminal to change the password to your user account and have full access to the file system.\nRegardless of whether or not you were using FileVault, I believe if they remove and re-insert the memory, it will unlock automatically.  Sorry for your loss. This is probably one of those times that it would benefit you to \"know a guy,\" and by \"guy,\" I mean a vigilante badass.   \nIt depends on your police jurisdiction (or more specifically, how helpful the cops are and how well you know them), but I have heard of friendly cops tracking down a stolen iPhone using Find My iPhone and getting it back to the rightful owner within the same night, but in most cases, they have bigger issues to worry about, especially if you live in a big city.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2015 Horrible Ping w/ Slow Download/Upload Speeds I've been having a little issue with my wireless connection on my Macbook Pro and I can't seem to figure out what the issue is.

I tried different cables and power sources, none of which worked.\nI then proceeded to panic, and reset my phone in the settings app. The phone began to reset and then got stuck after a while on a full progress bar, so I did a reboot of the device, and now it is stuck on a boot.\nIt starts normal, than a progress bar appears, which goes about 1/5th of the way and then the phone reboots to a normal Apple logo, and then it turns a bit orange (F.lux from the jailbreak), and then just stays like that forever.\nI was wondering if there is a way to enter DFU mode or recovery mode, without the phone being plugged into anything and then reset the device so I can go to Apple, or have I lost this phone forever?\nAlso, I have tried cleaning out the charging pins multiple times.\n\nA: I thought this is not issue of jailbreaking.

A submenu offers the items Drafts Mailbox, Sent Mailbox, Junk Mailbox, Trash Mailbox, and Archive Mailbox.\nAfter using one of these commands, the selected folder disappears. That folder's name is masked, displayed under the Drafts, Sent, Junk, Trash, and Archive icons at the top of the sidebar as the name of the account rather than the actual folder name.\nHow can I tell what is the currently designated folder for each function (Drafts, Sent, Junk, Trash, and Archive)?\n\nA: You can read it with a text editor at the beginning of the file ~/Library/Mail/V3/MailData/BackupTOC.plist. \nWhile you can read the paths of the mailboxes, you do not see, which belongs to Drafts and which to Sent, etc. On my system, the entries in the file are in the following order: Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Trash, Junk, Archive.\nThe mailboxes for each account are listed next to each other. \nNote: Changes to the paths in this file have no effect. You must set it within the Mail application.\n", "Q: Transferring file creation dates to an Asustor NAS I have just purchased a new Asustor 7004T network attached storage device, which I had hoped to use as an archive for the massive quantity of files I have spread across multiple computers and external hard drives. The problem is, I have many of these files meticulously organized by \"date created\", and recently learned, to my utter disbelief, that my device (and apparently NASes in general) does not preserve the creation date of any file transferred to it. For example, if I take three files dated 9/24/2008, 7/31/2011, and 1/6/2014, and simultaneously migrate them over to the NAS on 11/15/2015, they all end up with the timestamp of 11/15/2015. This is nothing short of a disaster for me, and I am flabbergasted (and frankly outraged) that a top-of-the-line, $1,000+ device expressly made for storing and backing up files was designed without a data storage capability possessed by any $5 2GB flash drive.\nI am desperate for a way to circumvent this fatal (for me) flaw of the Asustor NAS. I would be eternally grateful to anyone who could recommend a means of copying files to an NAS that leaves the creation date intact, without potentially corrupting any data or otherwise compromising the security of my files.\nSome key information: my computer is a 2012 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.9.5. I am a 1988 model human being compatible with most Web Browsers and proficient with a handful of basic applications such as Microsoft Word, with the capacity to comprehend and follow simple step-by-step instructions as far as more technical tasks are concerned. In other words, if your solution is any more complex than downloading and installing an app, you should probably take a \"for dummies\" approach in explaining it to me. I would also appreciate any input from users of a particular method who found it to be buggy, ineffective, or otherwise problematic, for Murphy's Law is an ever-present specter in my life, and I would thank you to inform me of all the pros and cons of a particular solution before I risk implementing it.\nThank you in advance to all who contribute their help. I have not been able to find any other sites or forums where someone has asked about this issue in regard to a Mac or Asustor device, and hope that this thread will prove helpful to other users of those systems who share my predicament (I cannot imagine I am the only one).\n\nA: The Problem lies not in your Asustor per se but in the file system (and subsequently the drive configuration) you use and the copy routine you use. In a nutshell: There are different methods to copy files (f.e. rsync) and different ways the file systems store data (f.e. creation date). \nWithout further Information regarding your NAS-Setup, File system (necessary) and RAID Level (not necessary, just to be complete), the possible solution at this point would be very general: One possibility would be to use rsync to transfer files from you Mac to the NAS - it should copy all data including creation date. It is a command line tool but there is Software with a GUI which should be more to your likeing. I suggest 'Carbon Copy Cloner', a commercial software but with a 30 day trial.\nYou should start with that and test it with a few files. If it does not work you should provide more information about the file systems used in the NAS and your external drives.\n\nA: There is a difference between a Copy-N-Paste and Moving a file from a computer to a NAS. Copying from a computer to a NAS will preserve the files original metadata, including the creation time and date stamp; the time and date modified, will of course, represent when the file was copied or transferred to the NAS device. The user should be able to use the sort function within Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows) to organize files by Creation date/time. Moving a file, however, saves the file as a new entity with a creation time/date reflecting when the file was moved. Moving files to a different location is inherently risky, a lost connection during a move or Cut-N-Paste may result in data loss at both the source and destination.\n", "Q: OS X 10.11(.1) Randomly freezes while browsing Ever since I updated to El Capitan I keep getting random freezes.. this is the 2nd time it happened while browsing on safari and while watching videos on Youtube. Anyone having problems with this as well? Im on 10.11.1.\nI tried resetting the default things, such as PRAM etc. I even brought my MacBook back to the store and there wasn't any hardware issues.\nI checked the log and both of the times these freezes happened I see something about watchdog daemon becoming unresponsive. After the freeze, which takes 1 minute or a bit less.. the macbook becomes responsive again but is very very sluggish.\nI'm running OS X 10.11.1 on a MacBook Pro 15\" 2014.\nI could get you log files if needed, not sure which part would be interesting for you but just let me know.\n\nA: I kept having this too. After using Youtube for a while, Safari froze and was then on behaving very sluggishly even if restarted. Only reboot of the whole system restored Browser back to normal (until Youtube would freeze it again).\nThe problem seems to have disappeared along with the latest OS X 10.11.2, so I recommend you just update the OS X.\n\nA: Looking through the Logs i could not see anything useful in identifying your problem. Since your Problem seems to be isolated to Safari and started to appear intermittently after the update to 10.11 i suggest the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*clear the Safari Cache, f.e. by using the Method described on the following Apple Support page at \"If Safari doesn't load pages from multiple sites\"\n\n*clear the 'Saved Application State' for Safari found at ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState by deleting the folder (with Safari closed, of course)\n\n\nTry this first and see if it will solve your issue.\n", "Q: App Store - Free app with externally paid for login - does this require revenue split with Apple?

How do I turn this off?\n\nA: iOS dims the display just before the Auto-Lock period.\nYou can set this period in Settings → General → Auto-Lock.\nHowever, if Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode is set to on, the regular auto-lock setting is disregarded. \n\nA: I was having the same trouble with this. My auto-lock was already turned off, but my phone continued to keep dimming and I couldn't figure out why. \nI eventually realized my power-saving mode was on which makes it dim automatically. Make sure yours is off: Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > Off \n\n\n*\n\n*Iphone 6 user \n\n\nA: settings > general > accessibility > Display accommodations > Auto Brightness > off\n\nA: You can't.

But if my phone is plugged in, I don't have a problem with the screen dimming.\n", "Q: Automator service script ALWAYS launches application, disregarding conditional I wrote a little service script to open an iTerm terminal window on an arbitrary folder on Finder.\nI want it to check if iTerm is running, and if it is to open the terminal session in a new tab instead of on an existing one.\nThe script goes like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n\nset cdPath to \"cd \" & (quoted form of POSIX path of (input as string))\n\nif application \"iTerm\" is running then\n    display notification \"running\"\n    tell application \"iTerm\"\n        set termWin to (current terminal)\n        tell termWin\n            launch session \"Default\"\n            tell the last session\n                write text cdPath\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nelse\n    display notification \"not running\"\n    tell application \"iTerm\"\n        activate\n        set termWin2 to (current terminal)\n        tell termWin2\n            tell the last session\n                write text cdPath\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend if\nreturn input\nend run\n\nProblem is that when I run the script as a service, it will always behave as if iTerm was already running (displaying the \"running\" notification), even if iTerm is closed and very clearly NOT running.\nBut if I paste the same script to the Script Editor (setting cdPath to a literal, like set cdPath to \"cd /etc\") and execute it directly it will work correctly, either opening a new iTerm instance or reusing an existing one and creating a new tab, and display the corresponding notifications.\nWhat's going on here? Why running the script as a service would detect the application as running no matter what?\nUpdate\nIf I simplify the script to just displaying the notifications like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n\nset cdPath to \"cd \" & (quoted form of POSIX path of (input as string))\n\n  if application \"iTerm\" is running then\n    display notification \"running\"\n  else\n    display notification \"not running\"\n  end if\n  return input\nend run\n\nIt'll behave as expected (displaying 'running' or 'not running' accordingly).\nBut if I add the \"tell application\" part, it will always go the through \"running\" branch, no matter what. \nE.g.: \non run {input, parameters}\n\nset cdPath to \"cd \" & (quoted form of POSIX path of (input as string))\n\n  if application \"iTerm\" is running then\n    display notification \"running\"\n  else\n    display notification \"not running\"\n    tell application \"iTerm\"\n        activate\n    end tell\n  end if\n  return input\nend run\n\nWill always open iTerm (even if the tell application \"iTerm\" it's on the \"not running\" branch, but display the \"running\" notification, from the \"is running\" branch... The mere presence of a \"tell application\" will trigger opening the app then the Service is run.\nIs there a way to circumvent this? \nThanks and regards.\n\nA: El-Capitans security restrictions are NOT responsible for erroneous behaviour above. I tested the script some more and found that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any \"is running\"-phrase needs to have a short \"delay\" in front of it to  reliably return a true answer ... but still won't do so if called as an app's service.\n\n*Furthermore I guess that Automator scripts are somehow \"pre-processed\" before being run as Services.\nAll if-branches are evaluated (played through) and thereby activated \"just in case\".\nIn jweaks code at stackoverflow, iTerm is only affected directly in the 2nd clause (\"tell ...\").\ntell application \"System Events\" to set theProcesses to name of every ¬\n    every process whose visible is true\n\nif theProcesses contains \"iTerm\" then display notification \"running\"\nelse [...]\n\n\nTry this code in ScriptEditor, Automator and as Service in Safari:\ndisplay notification \"\" & running of application \"TextEdit\"\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to activate\nquit application \"TextEdit\"\ndisplay notification \"\" & running of application \"TextEdit\"\n\nYou will get different results from AppleScript/Automator (=> false + true) and Safari (true + true).\nEspecially AppleScript/Automator's true from the 2nd notification is quite telling.\n\n... however, if you insert just a minute delay, say 0.01, after the \"quit\" line, running will be tested as \"false\" - if the script is run from within AppleScript/Automator.\n\nA: Sometimes I've also noticed that behaviour when running script, it's odd. Although most times it doesn't happen when not running script through Script Editor. However, here is a better alternative:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    # Adding tell application block has no effect on the if condition\n    # Try it with TextEdit, that's what I using to try this code, and works fine.\n    if (the name of application processes as text) contains \"iTerm\" then\n        # Will quit the application if running\n        log \"Running\"\n        tell application \"iTerm\" to quit\n    else\n        # Will launch the application otherwise.\n        log \"Not Running\"\n        tell application \"iTerm\" to activate\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nA: I just found a way to do it. Although I'm creating an application instead of a service, they are almost the same. The basic idea is to put tell application iTerm into another script or into quotes, such that the optimization process won't make it open iTerm before executing this script. Thus you'll get the real result of if application \"iTerm\" is running.\nBut in the quoted script, since there is tell application part, we already know iTerm will be open before anything, we can directly activateiTerm and use the current session of current terminal (in fact, even in Automator, this still works even if iTerm is not opened firstly). I'm not sure if delay 0.01 is necessary here (you can test in your computer). But this one works for my purpose, which is to open current Finder path in a new iTerm window in current desktop. And if iTerm is not running, it won't open two iTerm windows.\nLet me know what you think. :-)\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set dir_path to quoted form of (POSIX path of (folder of the front window as alias))\n    end tell\n    CD_to(dir_path)\nend run\n\non CD_to(theDir)\n    if application \"iTerm\" is running then\n        #display dialog \"Running\" # for debug\n        run script \"\n            on run {q}\n                tell application \\\":Applications:iTerm.app\\\"\n                    set term to (make new terminal) # make a new window in current desktop since I don't want to mess with current ones\n                    tell term\n                        launch session \\\"Default\\\"\n                        set sesh to current session\n                    end tell\n                    tell sesh\n                        write text \\\"cd \\\" & q & \\\";clear;\\\"\n                    end tell\n                    activate\n                end tell\n            end run\n        \" with parameters {theDir}\n    else\n        #display dialog \"Not Running\" # for debug\n        run script \"\n            on run {q}\n                tell application \\\":Applications:iTerm.app\\\"\n                    delay 0.01\n                    activate\n                    set sesh to current session of current terminal\n                    tell sesh\n                        write text \\\"cd \\\" & q & \\\";clear;\\\"\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end run\n        \" with parameters {theDir}\n    end if\nend CD_to\n# part of code comes from http://peterdowns.com/posts/open-iterm-finder-service.html\n\n", "Q: Stuck at login in App Store I've upgraded to El Capitain and since then I can't login to the App Store.\nThe App Store prompts me for my login details and once I try to sign in, it just shows a spinner for ever.

This is great, but since the last column doesn't have a divider to the right of it, how can it be resized?\n\nA: The last column isn't actually a column, strictly speaking, it's a preview.\nThe only way to resize it is to enlarge the overall window, which can be a bit irritating if you are a lot of levels deep…\n\nYou can try Alt/dragging one of the columns smaller, which will change all of them. Then, allowing for a bit of a screen bug which means you need to change the window size slightly, you can gain as much room as possible for the final column/preview\nGraphics glitch/screen bug …\n\n\nA: Make the Finder window larger than the sum of the column width, and you will get a bar you can drag to resize. \nUsing the example image below, this was achieved by grabbing the resize bar between \"Size\" and \"Kind\" and shrinking the Size column just a tad. \nThis allows you to expand the \"Kind\" column.\n\n", "Q: Fix hard disk not detected after force eject I got an HDD on my Mid 2012 Macbook Pro 13 inch.

I recently asked about bottlenecks in the Mac architecture (The Mac Pro 12 core 2010 model) to try to create a set up that optimizes performance. \nIt was my intention to take 2 SSDs and RAID them on a PCI card to get a faster OS drive speed. I read an article at the Apple discussion board Considering RAID 0 or RAID 1? and was a bit alarmed to read this warning:\n\nApple will not allow OS X to be installed on a RAID set, so forget\n  about going there to speed up your machine, get a SSD instead.\n\nBefore I go through the time and effort, can someone verify if this is right? I've been searching for an hour and seeing only discussions of how to RAID and the various options, but no other remarks on running OS not being viable. \n\nA: The only positive evidence I can find is one can install  Mac OS X server on a software RAID set. The instructions state that a standard Mac OS X needs to be installed before the Server software installation. The only drawback is that, among other things, a Recovery volume cannot be created and FileVault cannot be used.\nOne could interpolate that you can indeed install Mac OS X on a RAID, but some very important technologies will not be available.\n", "Q: Execute arbitrary script when iTunes plays new song? I want to execute a script when iTunes plays a new song.  I have looked at Automator as well as the iTunes Library in Script Editor, but don't see anything that will allow me to do this.  Any ideas?\n\nA: You could use an AppleScript to watch for song changes. The script below will get you started:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set previousSong to \"\"\n\n    repeat\n        if exists process \"iTunes\" then\n            tell application \"iTunes\"\n                if player state is playing then\n                    set currentSong to name of current track\n                    if currentSong is not previousSong then\n                        set previousSong to currentSong\n\n                        -- Execute your script, command, or application here                        \n                        say \"Song changed\"\n\n                    end if\n\n                end if\n            end tell\n\n            -- Wait some seconds\n            delay 10\n        else\n            exit repeat\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\nThis AppleScript checks every 10 seconds for the name of the currently playing song.

It's like some button is stuck, but actually it's not, keyboard is ok. What is it can be?\nMBPr 2014 El Captain 10.11.1\n\nA: There is a very good chance that your battery must be replaced. Check it in Applications → Utilities → System Information → \"Power\": check the \"battery condition\": when it says \"replace\" or \"service\" replace it asap. Do not buy non-apple crap, they die faster than they are bought. In OWC there is a possibility that they have a replacement oem battery which is good. Only there.\nNote: a bad battery swells (and can go leaking also) and presses the keyboard on the underside.\n\nA: If you double click a key by accident, i may lock on.

Just recently started getting into OS X/iOS development and noticed several files have a \"d\" at the end. I.e launchd, accountsd, cloudd, assistantd, etc.. Not all have it just some. Just a quirky question I was pondering and figured if anyone knew the answer it would be you guys.\n\nA: Since OS X is in part based on FreeBSD here is relevant documentation from the FreeBSD Handbook's 3.8. Processes and Daemons...\n\n\"There is a convention to name programs that normally run as daemons\n  with a trailing “d”. For example, BIND is the Berkeley Internet Name\n  Domain, but the actual program that executes is named. The Apache web\n  server program is httpd and the line printer spooling daemon is lpd.\n  This is only a naming convention. For example, the main mail daemon\n  for the Sendmail application is sendmail, and not maild.\"\n\nTake note of the last two sentences from what I quoted, the trailing \"d\" is only a convention but as you can see with the example sendmail is the mail daemon and doesn't have the trailing \"d\".  There are also other daemons in Unix/Unix like OSes that do not use the trailing \"d\" for daemons however as a convention it is a good practice but not an absolute.\n\nA: Because it is a Unix pseudo-standard that daemons use that convention.  Of course you already knew that, based on the tags you applied to the question.\n", "Q: Mac Mini Server starts to unreponsive desktop I changed some of my file shareing options on my Mac mini (El Capitan) server and now it does not start.   It does shows desktop but i have no control  no menu bar (not even hidden) no dock, no spotlight ability... basically dead.   The option that I did was to remove the Home directory form the file sharing list.   I suspect that it i got it to remove all access to home folder for all users!    Any idea on how to fix this.\nIt is normally running without screen and mouse and keyboard so i remote desktop into it.   Remote desktopping into it shows the unresponsive desktop, but I can still use finder on other machines to access files on it.   My plan is to connect keyboard, mouse and screen to it and try to log in in single user or safe mode and try to fix permissions from there.    Any other clever suggestions?\n\nA: Let us assume you've broken all the users, to fix that, connect a keyboard and display and hold S to start into single-user mode and remove the set up file.  Making a new user is non-destructive and it gets you a usable shall immediately with superior tools available to diagnose and fix the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*My MBP will not startup properly!\nWhen you type halt, you can then start up the Mac and make a new local admin user with correct permissions and a working home folder. At that point you can evaluate whether to:\n\n\n*\n\n*restore from a backup\n\n*make a backup\n\n*fix whatever was broken or try to narrow down what broke\n\n*wipe and start over\n\n\nIf you're someone who's going to make a go of fixing things in single-user mode, I would enable SSH login which gives you a bunch better error message when user home folder Sprague and also debility to do remote maintenance  in many cases where screen sharing brakes. \n", "Q: Macbook gets stuck on Grey Screen, won't boot normally I've tried many steps so I'll list them here, I can do a reinstall but I prefer to figure out the actual cause of the problem and I don't think a reinstall will solve it.\nMacbook 2007, OSX version 10.7.5\nI was watching a YouTube video when something weird happened to the screen and the computer froze, so I forced a shutdown by holding down the power button.

Any more steps I can take that I haven't thought of?\n\nA: I too had this problem twice. The first time the system got stuck, and switched itself off. Then later when I was trying boot it got stuck at the grey screen. When I contacted Apple for support, they told me that my harddrive is not working anymore and replaced it. All data lost. The second time when it happened was when I tried to restart the system and it got stuck at the grey screen. I tried removing all the devices connected to the system and switched it back on. This time it worked.

Look for MKV's or MP4's.\nDepending on the format of the video in the AVI you may be able to play it with the Perian plugin for QuickTime.\nVLC is a good player and will play MKV and MP4 files, but if you still want to remove it you can just drag it to the trash. If you want to remove all of its corresponding files then download a free app called AppCleaner and use that to remove it. \n\nA: Let's first try and resolve the problem before quitting.\nWhat steps did you take when trying to open an AVI file? Please state your OS X version and the version of VLC you are attempting to use.\nIf right-click > open with > (other >) VLC ...doesn't work, then I would try reinstalling VLC.\n\nA: There is a fair chance that what you downloaded was not, in fact a real .avi file but a hoax, a virus.  \nThe chances of this are entirely dependant on where you got it - the BBC, 0%, PirateBay, 99%  \nHowever - Don't Panic - even if it was a hoax file, the chances it was a virus that could infect a Mac are infinitesimal. \nVLC will play just about anything you throw at it - it really is the Swiss Army Knife of players -  so it's always a reasonable hint if it won't play it that you were sold a pup, or you just got a bad [corrupt] download.\nVLC can show you any errors it encountered whilst trying to play a file -\nWindow menu > Errors & Warnings… or  Cmd ⌘   Alt ⌥   M \nThe output of that window might be fairly unintelligible, but you can use it to guess whether or not it even thought it was a real video, or whether it just was struggling with some esoteric format, or playback data error.\nIf in any doubt, or unless you are certain of the source - i.e. the BBC, then just trash it.\n", "Q: Mac book Pro is very slow on wifi connection I have three computers in my home.

The transmit rate and MCS index indicate that your mac has a high-speed connection to your router and that it's not an interference issue.\nMy next step would probably be timing me file transfer using Wi-Fi from the Mac to the PC or vice versa. You can enable filesharing on the Mac quite easily. download some YouTube movie from the Internet so that you've got something that will take 15 to 30 seconds to transfer so you can time it with the stopwatch. \nIt's hard to guess whether flash that runs the speed test.net simply running slow or you've actually got a legitimate speed issue with the Mac. \nYou'll also want to watch the activity monitor and the console application to see if you have io errors and if the network throughput matches the disk io which should all matching your benchmarking test.\n", "Q: List failed login attempts on Yosemite I want to see if somebody has tried to log in on my computer, which is running Yosemite. I am primarily interested in tracking ssh log in attempts, as well as tracking people physically typing passwords on my keyboard to try to log in.\nClosely related\nList failed login attempts on Mavericks\n\nA: sshd logging is determined in /etc/asl/com.openssh.sshd.\nIn short, you need to touch a file and then send syslogd a HUP signal:\ntouch /var/run/com.openssh.sshd-asl-enabled\nkill -HUP $(ps -ef | grep [s]yslogd | awk '{print $2}')\nAfter that, you will find the logs in /var/log/sshd.log\n\nA: This answer is based on this one, but that answer does not list ssh attempts on Yosemite\nHere is a start\ngrep \"authentication error for\" /private/var/log/system.log\n\nThis probably lists all failed login attempts via ssh. The answer in the linked answer still works; you can use\ngrep \"Failed to authenticate user\" /private/var/log/system.log\n\nto see failed local login attempts. This does not include login attempts from a terminal window.

Also I can no longer see any of my other things on finder.\n\nA: I have no problem sending VLC.app ( the .app extension is hidden by default) to the Trash and then emptying the Trash.  Works just as intended.\nYou can try using AppCleaner to remove it or use the Terminal.\nOpen up a Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and type the following followed by a space:\nrm -r\nThen drag and drop the VLC application bundle onto the Terminal window.  The command line should look as follows:\nrm -r /Applications/VLC.app\nNow press Enter and the VLC application bundle should be removed.\nIf it persists then preface the command with sudo as in the following example:\nsudo rm -r /Applications/VLC.app\nWhen you press Enter then enter your password and press Enter again.  (This is assuming your Account is an Admin Account.)\nYou also can try rm -rf /Applications/VLC.app, with or without sudo as necessary, as the -f option will attempt to force removal. \nNote: Be extremely careful when using rm as removed files/folders are permanently deleted and not placed in the Trash.

I tend to send things to print, even when not connected to my printer (via usb). This allows it to print the minute I connect the printer, which is nice when I am on my laptop. It used to work, even if I didn't connect my printer for a day or two, but now it doesn't. The print jobs seem to die after 3 hours. Any help?\n\nA: Printing in OS X is handled by CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System. Older versions of OS X had older versions of CUPS. A new It's not a bug, It's a \"feature\" was added in CUPS 1.6, which corresponds to Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, in order to prevent stuck jobs.\nThe MaxJobTime option, which defaults to 10800 seconds (3 Hours), will cancel the active print job on a printer that has timed out. The next job in the queue will start, either printing or eventually timing out.\nFrom the cups.conf man page:\n\nMaxJobTime seconds\n  Specifies  the  maximum time a job may take to print before it is canceled. The default is 10800 seconds (3 hours). Set to 0 to disable cancellation of \"stuck\" jobs.\n\nEditing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to include MaxJobTime 0 to disable this \"Feature\".\nIn my specific case, I used to be on 10.6.8 Snow Leopard until finally updating to 10.10 Mavericks, and wasn't aware of the change.\n", "Q: Time Machine offers to erase disk data (format), will it delete all my partitions?

Because the dropdown menu asks me to choose a partition, but then says \"delete disk\"\n\n*Time Machine uses the same stuff as Disk Utility?

For example I have: my iPhone 6S, my iPhone 6 (used for app development and testing), an iPhone 5S (also for testing on smaller screens), an iPad mini, an iPad pro, a new 2015 MacBook, a MacBook Air (a dedicated work machine), an older 2011 MacBook Air (used specifically for app development also), a Mac mini (being used as an HTPC), an iMac, an older Mac Pro (using it as a server), and a 2007 MacBook (for testing things on older OS'es i.e. Lion). I'm also sharing my Apple ID with a close family member who has two devices - an iPhone and an iPad. This totals 14 devices, 7 of each type, all of which are actively used. Even if you forget about the family member I'm sharing with, we're still at 12 devices.\nWhat isn't making sense to me is what exactly triggers a device to get added to this 10-device limit. Apple's documentation says \"automatic downloads\" or \"downloading previously-purchased content including books, music, movies and apps\" but this doesn't seem consistent. Example: my brand new iPad Pro will not login to Apple Music, saying that I've reached the limit of 10 devices. However, it will download apps from the App Store that I've previously purchased. \nAlso, I am unable to remove any devices from the list in the iTunes in the Cloud section. They all have their remove buttons greyed out. I don't mind if some of my older machines can't access Apple Music or even if they can't access every paid app, but I do use free App Store sourced apps on every machine (e.g. TextWrangler on Macs, Dropbox on iOS). \nTo further confuse me, I've never had to be conscious in the past about \"deauthorizing\" devices when it comes to apps. Over the past couple years I've easily had 20+ devices on my account at different times (all my own devices, but I upgrade a lot). Each of these devices has logged into my iCloud and downloaded apps from my purchased apps list. At no time was I ever made to specifically deauthorize any device in order to download my apps onto a new device. (iTunes Store content, i.e. music, movies, TV shows, has always had the 5-device limit - this isn't what I'm worried about. I'm mostly worried about apps.) Seeing this error with Apple Music on my iPad is the first time I've come across any issues with authorizing and deauthorizing devices.\nCould someone help explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*What triggers a device to get added to the 10-device limit? Does it happen anytime you login to the App Store and/or iTunes Music store on any device? It doesn't seem to be the case because I have paid and free apps running on plenty of devices.\n\n*How can I remove a device from the iTunes in the Cloud Devices page?\n\n*What will removing a device from this section do? e.g. Will that device no longer be able to download app updates (even for free apps)? Will it be unable to download purchased apps? Will it be unable to play protected purchased content (iOS devices)?\n\n*How has it been possible for me to associate clearly more than 10 devices in the past few years to my account without triggering this problem, but now I suddenly cannot stream Apple Music on my new iPad but can download apps to it? \n\n\nThe biggest concern I have honestly is apps. I have no problem managing and limiting authorizations to Apple Music, but I do need to be able to download at the very least my free apps to all my devices.\n\nEDIT:\nTo quote Apple:\nWhen you use certain iTunes Store features on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or computer, your iOS device or computer is automatically associated with your Apple ID in iTunes account settings. These features include:\n\n* Turning on iCloud Music Library.\n* Downloading past purchases you made in the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, or Mac App Store.\n* Turning on Automatic Downloads.\n* Turning on Family Sharing.\n* Subscribing to iTunes Match.\n\nThis suggests that there is actually a 10-device limit overall on how many devices I can have using apps I've purchased on my account. But this is clearly not the case - as per my list above I already have more than 10 devices on my account and it seems to be working just fine. \nThe only thing that seems to have triggered this situation is trying to play Apple Music on my new machine.\nSo, now the question becomes: is Apple Music using an authorization, or a device association, or both? Also, if device associations are supposed to be limited to 10 devices, how have I easily been able to have more than that many iOS devices pulling apps from my account over the years without ever manually disassociating devices?\nIf we go back to when I got my first iOS device, I could easily say I've had probably 20+ devices that have at some point had apps from my account installed on them. Most of those devices are old ones that I've sold or given away, but many I still have an use, albeit very infrequently - but never before have I ever run up against a warning about this when downloading apps on my account on a new device. The confusion for me is that I received the error when I tried to play Apple Music on a new device, not install apps on it - but I've never seen the error through the years and years of installing iOS apps on multiple devices - so I'm confused as to what limit I've actually reached and why.\nApple, seriously...why can't this just be SIMPLE? Apple Music should go alongside Authorizations. If there is some kind of limit on iOS devices and apps on them, then that should be device registrations (which I've actually never experienced). Keep it separate. \n\nA: It's all detailed in the Apple Support Article: View and remove associated devices in iTunes:\n\nWhen you use certain iTunes Store features on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or computer, your iOS device or computer is automatically associated with your Apple ID in iTunes account settings.\n\nand\n\nYou don't need to associate your devices to buy content, download new purchases, or to play back content that you've saved to listen to offline. \n\nTo remove a device:\n\nUnder the iTunes in the Cloud section, click Manage Devices. Click Remove next to the device that you want to remove.\n\nNote that only computers are Authorized and Deauthorized, and are limited to 5 per account. See this other article: Deauthorize your computer using iTunes\nFinally, this Discussion gave a good answer on Authorized vs Associated:\n\nA computer can be AUTHORIZED to play/use content purchsed from multiple iTunes Accounts. There is a limit to the number of computers that can be AUTHORIZED per account (5 total) but no limit as to how many accounts a computer can be AUTHORIZED to play. Once you have AUTHORIZED all the accounts AND downloaded all the purchased content from each account to a computer, this content can be also be played on any device ASSOCIATED with the computer. A device can only be ASSOCIATED to one computer but one computer can have many devices ASSOCIATED to it. As an example, you can use apps purchased on from multiple iTunes accounts on an iPad as long as the computer the iPad is ASSOCIATED with is AUTHORIZED to use/play the content for each of the accounts. Another example: if you also purchased music from all the iTunes accounts, you could listen to it on an iPad, iPhone and iPod as long as all three were ASSOCIATED with the computer where all the accounts were AUTHORIZED.\n\n\nA: Yes, I recently hit this with my AppleTVs, but it's not clear if downloading apps broke it or if you have to download content (TV/movies) for it to happen.  I just had a long conversation with support over the weekend where they coached me to attach some of my aTVs to another AppleID that is in my Family Sharing plan.  That will probably work, but with 2 factor authentication makes it unhandy for me to administer these devices.\n\nA: When you sign into Apple Music, iCloud Music Library is enabled which is what is throwing the dialog for you. If you turn off that feature, you can still use Apple Music to stream music just not download it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force \"low power\" graphics?

Fifty-percent of page/images load if lucky I'm living in Japan (if that's relevant) and often to go net- manga-cafés (or Starbucks) for my internet fix (too expensive to get it at home, ATM).\nAfter connecting to a Wi-Fi network, however, I'm left with about fifty-percent of web pages loading, but usually the page fails to load completely (can't reach server error).

Disabling this in Workgroupmanager again hides the EFI partition, too. \nSince Workgroupmanager was lastly updated on Mavericks it is still possible to manage e.g. USB shares to be only readable without having to install a OSX Server, as there is no on board solution for managing user accounts more differentiated than with System preferences.\n", "Q: In activity monitor what time frame is the data sent / received data from? In the network tab in activity monitor there is a read out of data usage showing sent and received in GB. What this dosnt tell you is over what time period this is, is it from a day, a week and month ? \nThis is from OSX Yosemite.\n\n\nA: For the top two figures, since last boot; for the bottom two, current.  \nAfter comments: It may be since launch of Activity Monitor - I have mine launch at boot & it stays open all the time, so I probably didn't notice the potential discrepancy.\nThe little graph is 'since switching to that tab', as it doesn't log more than about 5 minutes of data.\nThis machine's been up 9 days, this looks about right for my standard usage - \n\nIf I initiate a large download, the bottom figures become this [on a 150Mb/s line] - \n\nThe graph scale auto-zooms, so the earlier few KB/s vanishes into a flat line.  \nOnce the file has finished downloading, the top figures show the increase of about 2GB & the bottom pair goes back to being relatively idle\n\n\nA: The Data received and Data sent includes all network traffic. So if your machine is connected to a wi-fi network, but not the internet, it will show data sent between machines/devices. Also, if your machine is connected by ethernet to another machine, that's also counted.\nI figured this cos my machine (not connected to the internet) showed traffic of over 20GB, which tallies with the amount of data that I copied between this and another machine.\nSo, this figure is not a count of internet usage data.\nAs someone who occasionally has to use the iOS personal hotspot function, it's reassuring to know that this figure does not represent cellular data usage. For that, reset your iOS device's data counter.\n\nA: The data received count is reset when you restart your computer\n", "Q: popout a mac mail window from full screen / split view I run my mac mail in split view with other programs on a side monitor. Sometimes it would be nice to pop out reply windows and individual emails from full screen / split view so I can bring them to my main monitor.\nIs there anyway to do this without undocking the mail program all together?\n\nA: I asked Apple support about this one. The representative didn't seem to think that this was a supported feature in current OS X (El Capitan) and passed it along as a feature request.\nThe only other workaround I can think of is right-clicking Mail in the Dock to open a new viewer or new message on your primary display. This works for me when I have Mail in full-screen in an off-screen space.

I didn't have any space left on iCloud so I went to check what's going on there. I saw that my iPhone was taking up a lot of storage. My storage for pictures was still 7gb even after I deleted all of my pictures. I'm not even sharing any pictures and I also deleted all of my recently deleted pictures. All of them. Why is it still showing me under \"usage\" that I have 7gbs? I'm not able to backup my phone because I apparently I don't have any space when really I don't have 7gbs of pictures.\n\nA: Make sure to look in the recently deleted album.

I know about guided access which works great at locking them to one app (e.g., for homework) but sometimes I want to give them flexible time to use whatever app or game they want.\n\nA: There is a free and very simple way to limit time on iOS if you have an activation passcode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Clock app\n\n*Set a Timer\n\n*Make sure that \"Stop Playing\" is set under \"Sounds.\"\n\n\nIf a sound is set, naturally that plays. If \"Stop Playing\" is set, the device will go to the lock screen. Naturally, this will require your passcode or fingerprint!\nThis technique allows another user (my kids in this case) to use whatever apps they want, but only for a set amount of time until they need my passcode. You can also use guided access (linked above) to restrict them to only one app.\n", "Q: Enter day tasks in Calendar without times I feel constrained when I need to enter start and end time for a task because I know it can take another amount of time than entered.\nCan I somehow just make a list of tasks for a day, one after another?\nI saw all-day tasks, but I don't think these are what I need.\nAs an alternative, what tasks list could you recommend please?\n\nA: In Calendar, you can use the all-day events, that are shown one after the other.\nOtherwise, you can choose among multiple apps. For free:\n\n*\n\n*There is the default app Reminders, that allows you to create lists of events that you can check once completed.\n\n*One app I really like is Wunderlist. It has a good layout. It does more or less the same as Reminders, but it has much more functionalities. Obviously, you can sync with other devices.\n\n*You can also use Trello, which is an app for mobile phones and you can use on your Mac through the website. I consider that Trello is very complete but a little trickier.\n\nOf course there are much more apps. It depends to your personal taste.

I have signed out and back in to iCloud on both devices, and I have rebooted both devices. Nothing seems to work.\nIn fact, everything was working as it should until around the time I updated to El Capitan.\nHow can I troubleshoot SMS handoff from a cell phone to OS X?\n\nA: Handoff works over bluetooth primarily, so you don't really need WiFi connectivity. Start by toggling the bluetooth on both devices and see if other handoff / airdrop operations work. That will rule out interference and other issues on the basic connectivity.\nYou do need to be signed in to the exact same iCloud account on both devices, so checking the clocks of both and signing out and in can often verify iCloud account is operational on both sides.\n\nA: Saw on reddit you have to make sure in preferences of messages that you are on the same Apple ID as on your phone, some times for what ever reason they can be different than the account on the computer.\nAll that was correct for me, simply logging out in message preferences and logging back in fixed the issue for me.\n\nA: This just happened to me the other day, not initiated by anything I did. It started with my iPhone “acting” weird (smartphones be acting stupid!) telling me that No SIM was installed, which was bullcrap (in my experience, phones start “acting” this way at the 1.5 to 2 year mark... Hmm I wonder why?? Planned Obsolescence perhaps???). \nAnyway, when I saw that message, I restarted my iPhone, and it was functional. However, I didn’t notice until later that my iPad could no longer send or receive my SMS messages (iMessage was fine).\nI did some basic troubleshooting.\nI went to Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled and reenabled the iPad (and got no Forwarding code on the iPad)\n\n*Turned off/on iMessage on iPad\n\n*Rebooted iPhone and iPad throughout all this in many different combinations (while sometimes leaving things off before restarting, and reenabling them after reboot, etc.)\n\n\nNone of that worked.\nToday, I searched online for an answer again, and it led me to this post, for which I’m grateful, because it led me to investigate my settings once more, and I stumbled upon the problem and this is what fixed it for me!\nSettings > Messages > Send & Receive\nI don’t remember what the settings were on my iPad before this “broke” a couple of days ago, but when I got into my iPad settings, I could see that my phone number was not set to “Start New Conversations” which made me think that was the problem, so I compared the settings to my iPhone and ensured that my iPad was matching the iPhone settings. I specifically have both set to “Start New Conversations” with my phone number, and I think that’s what did it!\nNote that this fixed things right away, no need to reenable or resend codes or anything.\nI hope that helps someone!\n", "Q: Cleaning Milanese Loop band for Apple Watch The Milanese Loop band for Apple Watch has the tendency to show some dirt after a few months of regular use.

I have multiple user accounts under mail and more often than I'd like I send an email from the wrong account. I know it is possible to put a default account, but I would like a way to make me sure I am checking the account I am using before I can send the email, like leaving it \"blank\". Is there an app around doing something similar to that?\n\nA: I would add this as a comment instead of an answer if I had enough reputation.\nAn untested dirty solution might be to add another mail account with incorrect login info (so you can't actually send mail from it), and set this account to be the default account for sending new messages (see NEO's comment).\nThis way, if you forget to change the sending account, it will fail to send (it'll get stuck in your Outbox, I believe; obviously not the ideal solution if you don't think you would notice this!)\n", "Q: how to force a factory reset of an iPhone? I once used a sequence of button presses to force an iPhone to downgrade to its original iOS version, and its factory settings.\nIIRC is involved holding down the power button for 10 seconds and something else.\n Is that still possible?  what is the correct sequence of button presses?\n\nA: I believe what you are referring to is a DFU restore. To do this, first, turn the phone off by holding the Power Button and shutting off the phone. Next, with the phone still off, hold down the Home Button, and plug the phone into your computer (while still holding the Home Button). What you should see is a message in iTunes that the phone is in restore mode with the option to Restore the phone, while the iPhone screen remains black. If the iPhone screen is not black, you are not in DFU mode, and you should try again. \n\nA: There is no way to reset the firmware of an iOS device without using iTunes (okay, there are a couple ways, but that's beyond the scope of this answer, and they all require USB access to the device regardless). Also, there likely isn't a way to reset the firmware to the version of iOS that it was shipped with.

On a consistent basis, I try to close any open apps to save battery life. I close the apps by double clicking the home screen button & then swipe the apps upward on the touchscreen to close. However, this is my concern.\nSometimes, when I check to see if any apps are open, to my surprise, a message can be open or a pic that I did not open. \nIs it likely my iPhone is being remotely accessed? It's locked at all times. I occasionally change the pass code as an extra security measure; installed the apps \"Look Out\" and \"VPN Defender\" but the issue is still happening. Not certain what is going on. Concerned someone is remotely accessing my apps/iPhone in the background; possibly by jail break software that is successfully able to do this using my phone number or apple phone ID. \n\nA: Most likely what you are seeing is the cached image of the app. Your iPhone takes picture snapshots of apps as they run, specifically so that when you go into the app switcher, you see a graphic that looks like the app. It also refreshes this image from time to time. Most likely, you're just seeing a stale picture.\nAlso on an unrelated note, with the way iOS works, closing apps the way you are doing has virtually no impact on battery life. Placebo effect possibly, but not much more.\n\nA: If your phone is jailbroken, like it sounds as if you may be implying, the first thing you need to do is to change the root password, which is alpine.\nYou can do this from a mobile terminal app, and if you're not already root when signed in, do this:\nsudo -s\n[enter 'alpine' as root password, and hit enter]\npasswd\n[enter a new password]\n[verify the password]\nexit\n\nMake sure nobody has backdoor access by making sure nobody is authenticating via public key:\ncat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\ncat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nYou can also view remote connections via netstat to see who is connecting to you and who you are connecting to.\n", "Q: Incompatible Software for next OSX?

I've never noticed a connection like this before so I'm curious if I should be worried.\n.\nIn the screenshot: despite the arrow next to the IP address going rightwards, there's a symbol next to the log that indicates it was incoming.\n\nA: The NetBIOS name service is somewhat similar to Apple's mDNS, but it is the older technology. Within a Windows network, it distributes the types of services your machine is offering by shouting out in the network what is has.\nA citation from wikipedia:\n\"[…] In order to start sessions or distribute datagrams, an application must register its NetBIOS name using the name service. NetBIOS names are 16 octets in length and vary based on the particular implementation. Frequently, the 16th octet, called the NetBIOS Suffix, designates the type of resource, and can be used to tell other applications what type of services the system offers. In NBT, the name service operates on UDP port 137 (TCP port 137 can also be used, but rarely is).\nThe name service primitives offered by NetBIOS are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add name – registers a NetBIOS name.\n\n*Add group name – registers a NetBIOS \"group\" name.\n\n*Delete name – un-registers a NetBIOS name or group name.\n\n*Find name – looks up a NetBIOS name on the network.\n[…]\"\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS#Name_service\n", "Q: How to create desktop shortcut for Chrome profile and run two or more profiles simultaneously?

But I cannot access historical Activity data which should be displayed in the iPhone app.\nI have tried restoring the watch from a backup and setting up the watch as new. Neither has worked.\nA little background: I bought my Apple Watch along with my iPhone 6s Plus. That initial pairing worked without any bugs in Activity on phone or watch. However, two weeks after purchase, my iPhone experienced some kind of catastrophic failure. I got it replaced at the Apple Store. Since pairing my watch with the replacement phone, the iPhone Activity app has never recognized that I have already set up the Watch Activity app.\n\nA: I have since solved the problem. Something was seemingly corrupted in the iPhone's Health database. Nothing could read or write data to the Health database, including step data (which should be automatically added from the Mwhatever chip) and manually entered data such as weight. \nTo solve the issue, I unpaired the phone and watch, then set up both the phone and watch as new. Setting up the phone from a backup did not solve the problem because the (hypothesized) corrupt database was (seemingly) included in the backup.\nSince setting up the phone as new and re-pairing the watch, Health data works fine.\n\nA: Only thing I have found online about this is a reset and setup as new corrects the issue. Restoring from backup will not work\n", "Q: the credit you entered is invalid while changing app store country I have 3 credit cards, AMEX VISA and Master, all of them are assuringly valid in Japan, but when I tried to switch country back to Japan, it always said \"the card you entered is invalid.\" whichever I used.   I don't have any unpaid bills or else, just changed the country to update some apps not displayed in Japan's app store.\nAnyone can give me an explanation or how can I get out of this?  \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The credit card used must be issued in the country of the app store, in your case Japan. It's not enough to have the card accepted in the country (most cards are accepted globally).\n", "Q: How to bind specific window to a hotkey? On Windows I use a simple Autohotkey script that allows me to easily bind to and switch beetween opened windows.\nFor example, I'm about to be using a browser, two consoles and a text editor in the next hour. So I open the browser and press Ctrl+Win+1 to bind it to the 1 key. Similarly, I map consoles to 2 and 3 keys, and the editor to 4 key.\nAnd now I can switch to the specific app just by pressing Alt+<number>. It allows me to work literally not touching a mouse for hours. I can't imagine my life without it.\nThe question is: How do I achieve this on El Capitan? I've tried the Automator and Karabiner apps, but did not succeed.\n\nA: Try out Witch - among many other features:\nChoose any of the first ten windows with a single keypress.\n\n", "Q: Accessing Exchange from OS X - what restrictions are respected? I have just set up my own OS X machine to access my work mail (using Exchange).\nTo my understanding there are several restrictions requested by Exchange that clients needs to obey.  For instance, when using an iPhone the user configured lock time is overridden with what Exchange requires.  It may also be that using too many attempts to unlock the phone may cause it to erase itself (at least that is what Exchange asks for). \nWhat restrictions are obeyed by OS X?   Will my machine require password when opening the lid?  Will it erase itself if I mistype my password three times?\n\nA: Outlook cannot enforce computer locking, that would require your Mac to be joined to the (Active Directory) domain and only AD logins permitted. There may be Outlook specific settings that are specified but there is no way to enforce computer locking (on a Mac) just by setting up an Exchange account in Outlook. Setting it up in Mail.app, well there is very little that can be done other than forcing a password change.\n", "Q: Will the hard link file consume the same size of origin file? already known that the hard link is just another name for linked file.\nBut what upset me is that when select both the original file and the hard link file the size finder shows is doubled.\nSo is it just a illusion or a real case?\n\nA: Basically the Finder is unaware of any hard links (at least when summing up file sizes), so each file/link just counts on its own. If you happen to have several hard links pointing to the same physical file in your selection, the calculated size will be bigger than the space used on disk.\nLet's say you have a folder containing two hard links to the same file data:\n\nIf you run \"Get Info\" on the folder in Finder, you'll get the sum of both file sizes, even though they only use space on disk once:\n\nSo yes, Finder doubles the size (or multiplies it in cases with more than two hard links).\nWhile it might seem easy to detect such situations within one folder, it's not so easy in cases where you sum up the size on a top folder of a deep folder hierarchy. Of course it would be possible to keep track of all physical files counted (which all have a unique id), but in practice the use of hard links is rare so it's probably just not worth the hassle. The only places I've found hard links on my Mac are\n\n\n*\n\n*hard linked image files from migrating from iPhoto to Photos\n\n*Xcode documentation files\n\n*Terminfo and timezone definitions\n\n*Safari caches\n\n", "Q: Changing icon of a mounted disk image I want to modify the icon of my mounted disk image, the same way as FUSE for OS X.\nMy desktop screenshot, where my disk image is the left one (name is censored):\n\nChanging the icon of the dmg is simple, but has no effect on the mounted drive.\n\nA: The, e.g., osxfuse-2.8.2.dmg disk image file uses a hidden .icns file named .VolumeIcon.icns in the root of the volume and has the Custom Icon attribute set, probably using /usr/bin/SetFile. E.g.: SetFile -a C /Volumes/FUSE\\ for\\ OS\\ X\nYou can also change the icon of the mounted disk image from its Info sheet. Place the wanted icon on the Clipboard then select the disk image on the Desktop and press Command-I then click the icon in the upper-left corner of the Info sheet and paste the wanted image there.\n\nA: To add a custom icon to the mounted volume of your dmg file, you first have to convert it to a sparsebundle or at least to a r/w dmg:\nhdiutil convert -format UDSB -o /path/to/output/image /path/to/source/image.dmg #the extension sparsebundle will be added to the output file automatically\n\nThen double-click the sparsebundle to mount it as a volume. \nCopy the custom icon.

I wonder if there is a key combination to enable \"free roaming, scrolling\" mode, which locks the mouse and scrolls the screen according to the mouse motion, just like two-finger scrolling in trackpads. So that I will map the extra key on the trackball with that combination and scroll around with the ball while pressing that button. \n\nA: Okay I actually found it. I installed Keyremap4Macbook and mapped CursorMove to ScrollWheel. \n", "Q: Single-button shortcut for \"Do not Disturb\" Is there a way I can bind a single key on my keyboard to toggle \"Do not Disturb\"?\nIt would be more convenient that opening up the notification center and moving that awkward slider.\nI do think that you can bind a key to a script, so a command line option for \"Do not Disturb\" would work as well, so if there is a command-line tool to enable/disable \"Do not Disturb\" then I will take that as an answer (since I am muy familiar with bash and applescript).\n\nA: Sure. Download the ruby script from https://gist.github.com/samnung/c7e767167cf70531ccdc and then just make a bash wrapper to call it.\ndo_not_disturb.rb on\n\nYou'll may want a tool like FastScripts to call the script (and if so, place your bash calling script in ~/Library/Scripts for it to show up there nicely)\n\nA: Hold down the Option key and click on the Notifications icon in the menu bar.\n", "Q: Finder Connect to Server Opens into VLC I wanted to connect to an FTP Server using Finder's Go > Connect to Server option.\nSo I try to do so like this:\n\nBut, when I try to do so, it opens in VLC and then VLC crashes. \n\nAnyone facing a similar problem? What can I do to open it in Finder itself? Do I need to change some defaults? If so, where?\n\nA: I haven't used the \"Connect to Server\" menu command in years.  I go into Terminal and type either a command or open and a URL that does what I want.  In your case, since sftp is a command, try sftp bang.bong.boom.ac.in\n", "Q: Bind keyboard key (like F16) to execute command? OK, I think this used to be an option in an older version of OSX, but I can't find in in the latest version.\nHow do I bind a certain key (like F16 for instance) to run a Terminal command?  I'd rather not install any additional services.\n\nA: I just checked my 10.9.5 and 10.6.8 systems, and both have this under:\n    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts\nThis allows you to bind a key to a command available via the menu, either globally (for all programs) or just a specific program.\nIf what you want to bind isn't a standard command, you can create an Automator plug-in that becomes available via the Services menu of a program, so that you can bind it to a key.\n", "Q: Name Extension based launcher for Mac Here is an example of what I need. I have a .md file (markdown). I use e.g. 3 MD-related applications: Sublime for more developer stuff; Ulysses for more writing stuff; Marked for viewing; Typed for short stories.\nI would need an app that would give me a short beautiful menu of my apps I want to assign with the extension. In this case the workflow would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue open command on a md file\n\n*Since this app is registered as default handler, it popups and then\n\n*I can choose quickly (by hitting the number, letter, or cursors) the menu option\n\n*That is going to open the target application.\n\n\nIs there such a 'opening-proxy' tool?\nEDIT\nThis tool should not depend on Finder.\n\nA: Another solution is Alfred. There is a shortkey that popups Alfred window pre-populated with currently selected file. Then you can choose Open With... to choose which app you want to open file with.\n\nA: After searching a lot: Magic Launch. It does almost like what I ask, except you can't set more then one app per rule.\n", "Q: How can I kill Finder if it's not responding? I have some Finder windows that I just cannot close. They are completely unresponsive, and have the rainbow wheel whenever I select any of them.\nForce Quit / Relaunch doesn't help, because the windows just get reopened again and they continue to be unresponsive. They also don't respond to e.g. Command + Option + W.\nOther applications are fine, it's just Finder that's stuck.\nIs there a way I can force quit Finder without reopening all the windows?\n\nA: Answer found here.\nOpen a terminal, and move the saved settings from Finder into a backup folder just in case:\nmv ~/L*/S*/*finder.savedState Desktop\n\nThen, you can Force Quit Finder as usual using Command + Option + Esc, or use this handy terminal command:\nkillall Finder\n\nThen, assuming everything looks good, you can delete the finder.savedState folder which has appeared on your desktop.\n\nA: You can relaunch the Finder.\nJust press ctrl + alt and right click on the Finder icon on the Dock. Then select Relaunch and it's done.\n", "Q: Is there an easier way to compare iOS to Android apps than manually checking each app? Next year, I'm getting myself a new phone, and it'll either be a Nexus or an iPhone. I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy S4, but I'm fed up with how slow security updates occur and how often Samsung installs random crapware on my phone that I didn't ask for. In addition, the S4 is at the end of its lifecycle and might not get a full version of Android 6.0.\nI'm currently verifying whether switching to iOS won't lock me out of any of my apps. I have spent barely any money on in-game app purchases for Android, so that's not holding me back. However, I have a number of apps that I use weekly, often even daily, and I want to make sure I still have access to those, or at least something similar.\nI could manually check each app on the itunes store, but that's a long and manual process that I would prefer to keep as a last resort. Is there an easier way to check what Android apps are available on iOS or at least have something similar?\n\nA: Borrow an old iPhone and run the Apple migration tool by following the setup directions on iOS 9 or you could use the Relo tool to attempt a dry-run on the Android side.\nThat way, you can actually use the new OS for a bit and if it's unlocked, you could swap SIM cards between the two devices. If you don't mind the cash outlay, you could also buy a new phone outright and educate yourself on the return policy if you're mostly sure the change will be for good.\n", "Q: My Macbook Air's Charger will not charge when plugged in, I've already reset the SMC. I also just got it back from Apple...What can I do? I've drained my battery looking for the answer to my question even more... please help! The charger works some days. I had found a combination of keys that help turn the light on once, but I can't find it anymore. I've reset the SMC or whatever already and still nothing is happening. I hate this damn charger.\n\nA: There are several reasons a MagSafe power adapter will intermittently show the Green/Amber LED charge status. If it comes and goes it may indicate a short or break in the thin DC line cable. This usually happens at the power brick end where it runs into the adapter itself. You may not even see a cut in the plastic wire cover but if it looks badly creased it may be a wire break internally that touches enough sometimes to work. The other end (where the MagSafe connector is) can have the same issue. If the MagSafe is the MagSafe 1 type (MagSafe 2 has a thinner connector profile) and it is the right-angled L-shape connector even if the cable looks fine it may be that it has twisted loose inside the metal connector. The cable running into the connector should not twist at all if you hold the metal connector in one hand and gently try to twist the cable running into it with the other hand. If it rotates at all that or a DC line break on the other end near the adapter itself means you need a new adapter. Otherwise try connecting the MagSafe connector the opposite direction you normally connect it and wiggle it when attached so the pins seat correctly. You will know it works if the LED lights.\nIf after all of this you still have issues and the computer itself in the upper right of the display continues to indicate it's not connected to power it may simply be a bad adapter needing replacement, the connector on the computer needs to be cleaned or replaced (MagSafe DC-in board) or worst case the charging subsystem on the logic board is defective. There are other possibilities but more rare. If a new adapter works consistently then getting a new adapter is your answer. Make sure is is a REAL Apple adapter. There are many many knockoffs that look like the real thing until you look closely. Typically they weigh less and of course cost less but they don't last very long. Hope something here helps. \n", "Q: iTunes media keys not working in Mac OS X El Capitan My media keys had stopped working in iTunes on my Macbook Pro. They were working fine in VLC. I tried checking for the usual suspects:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes preferences\n\n*Google Chrome Play music extension\n\n\nNeither of them was the case for me.\nI created a new user account on my Mac and the media keys worked fine on that one. So I tried copying the com.apple.itunes files from the Library of that account into the main account. This didn't help neither.

I've edited it few times, then renamed, moved to iCloud, then again edited and finally copied to a local machine. Now here's a problem:\nShortcut for this service is Command-Control-T. If a shortcut is set to this, then in Finder and Terminal applications, the shortcut doesn't work, while it works elsewhere. Moreover, when I open services menu in these two apps, I see entry \"Launch Terminal\" and it works only if clicked. No symbols, denoting key combination of shortcut are displayed in this menu, only the name of the service. The problem disappears if I set another key combination for this service or if I rename it. I tried rebooting several times and I tried rebuilding LaunchServices database with \nsudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\n\nA: Command-Control-T is used to add files/folders to Favorites Sidebar in Finder.

Recently, my Dropbox.app stopped launching correctly. If I double-click on the app or try to launch via spotlight, the app just silently dies within a second. I see it show up in Activity Monitor, but no messages are printed if I watch Console. There's no warning or error dialog.\nIf I use Terminal to issue something like:\nopen Dropbox.app\n\nthen it runs correctly.\nI suspect my launch environment got messed up (perhaps python?). But I have no idea how to debug this since Console is revealing nothing.\nWhat are some steps to debug an app that silently dies?\nIs there a systematic way to toggle all environment preferences that are causing open Dropbox.app to succeed from Terminal? \n\nA: You could start by tracing the executable:\n% sudo dtruss /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox\n\nIt may be loading the wrong python, etc.  Sometimes a trace will give you a clue as to where your app is crashing, esp. if you only have an executable.\nYou can also look at how the executable was linked, maybe it's finding the wrong version of a library (ldd on linux, otool on osx):\n% otool -TVLrH /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox\n\n", "Q: How can I reinstall OS X without a valid App Store connection? I have a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro that was used by a \"less than responsible\" user.  As such, it seems to have become infected with malware that rewrites all SSL certificates.  These certificates cannot be validated by OS X which is what alerted me to the fact that there is a problem.\nMy issue is that I cannot access the App Store to initiate a reinstallation of OS X.  Since the MacBook Pro can't validate the App Store SSL certificates, nothing loads.\nSo, I'm stuck.  What steps should I take to reinstall OS X or restore access to the App Store?\n\nUpdate: Cmd + R on boot doesn't seem to work (perhaps due to the Malware).

I saw the message \"Downloading Messages Paused (On Battery)\" in Mail.app in El Capitan.\nWhat does this mean? The MacBook was plugged in to the wall, not running on battery. What would cause downloading to stop/pause?\n\n\nA: It may have paused while you were operating your MacBook on battery power. As per Apple support document, If Mail on your Mac downloads messages only when you open them:\n\nWhen your Mac notebook is running on battery power, Mail in OS X El Capitan conserves energy by pausing the full download of messages that are that are older than 30 days, or older than the 10,000th message downloaded. Mail downloads messages from newest to oldest.\n\n\nA: Generally this message is displayed by Mail.app in OS X El Capitan, when MacBook is running on battery power and is low on charge. As your MacBook is connected to power, first try clicking the reload button shown alongside, Paused (On Battery) text. If that doesn't work, try relaunching Mail.app to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nFrom the Apple Support Document, If Mail on your Mac downloads messages only when you open them:\n\nWhen your Mac notebook is running on battery power, Mail in OS X El Capitan conserves energy by pausing the full download of messages that are that are older than 30 days, or older than the 10,000th message downloaded.

Viewing the messages in the Google web interface showed that they were not blank.\nRestarting the app usually fixes it.\nI deleted all my emails (by deleting mail folder ~/Library/Mail) and started again - and it was OK for about a week - and now it's started doing it again. Rebuilding mailboxes doesn't help.\nI found links around the web to cases of this back in 2010/2011 - like this\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2364054\nBut it appeared to go unsolved.\nIs this just a bug in El Capitan - and is there a solution?\n\nA: To fix this issue there are two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild\nTo rebuild a Mailbox in Mail, select the mailbox you want to rebuild and click on the Mailbox menu; at the bottom there is the Rebuild option. Repeat this step for each one of your Mailboxes.\nIt can take few hours to reindex a large mailbox and if it's an IMAP or Exchange mailbox, the rebuild will have to download again everything from the server.\n\n\n*Reindex\nIt is also often necessary to manually reindex Mail messages after a major OS upgrade. This is also necessary if Mail becomes unresponsive and/or if search is not functioning correctly or the app doesn't run.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail if it’s open.\n\n*From the terminal run \nmkdir ~/Desktop/backup\nmv ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Envelope\\ Index*  ~/Desktop/backup`\n\n(replace V2 with V4 for Sierra).\n\n*Launch Mail and it will build new Envelope Index files; that can take a long time if there are many messages to reindex and if it's an IMAP or Exchange mailbox, the rebuild will have to download again everything from the server.\nIf everything seems to be working correctly, you can now delete the backup from from your desktop (rm ~/Desktop/backup).\n\nA: You could try to delete the whole Mail folder here:\n ~/Library/Mail\nand delete the mail preferences files in\n~/Library/Preferences\nThen reconfigure the Mail. This will of course delete emails which are only saved locally. Instead of deleting you could of course close the app and move the files to another location for backup.\nI've seen the same issue happening. The problem occured after switching the mail server. I had tried everything I could think of like rebuilding the mail box, deleteting the mailbox indexes, renaming mail boxes, force re-downloading the emails, re-adding the email account. The only thing that worked was deleting what i mentioned above.\n\nA: I have this problem infrequently. Quitting and restarting mail.app fixes it and just takes a second. Another quick and dirty solution is to click on email forward which will let you see the email contents right away.\n\nA: This is an old question but I landed here from a search; one thing that works for me sometimes when other solutions listed here don't is to move the email in question to a different account. The contents usually become visible immediately. You can then move it back (if you want to) and it will remain visible.\n\nA: Most mail issues can be reduced to a specific fault with a little troubleshooting.\nOpen the connection doctor window in Mail.app and see if you can determine one specific mail host with issues.\nThen set up a new user account with only that mail account and enable logging. At that point, you will know if you have a networking issue, a problem with one computer or a problem with one mail provider and your specific mail client.\nThen you can decide to work with support for that mail provider, document the failure here with specific error messages and/or determine that you have a temporary issue that clears up over time due to capacity or temporary networking issues / delays / one host.\n", "Q: I can't find an app that I purchased (wasn't free) anywhere?

The other day I upgraded everything that Homebrew was managing, and I think the problem started after that: but I can't be sure.\nHow can I go about fixing this?\n\nA: Okay, I ended up running\n$ sudo apachectl configtest\n\nwhich returned\nhttpd: Syntax error on line 488 of /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.2/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.14/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so into server: dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.14/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so, 10): image not found\n\nWhen I edited httpd.conf, it turned out that it was trying to load two different version of libphp5.so: a new version that had been freshly installed (I think) by Homebrew, and an old version that Homebrew had (I think) deleted once it installed the new version.\nFor some reason, when Apache tried to load the old version of libphp5.so and found it wasn't there, this prevented Apache running at all. As soon as I deleted the line that tried to load the missing libphp5.so and restarted Apache everything worked fine.\n\nA: Easier for me, listening on 8080 not 80 curl -I -L localhost helped me with the right info: Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused\n", "Q: Switching \"primary\" imac in Target Display Mode I work in an office with a bunch of old iMacs sitting around. I thought I'd get clever and strap a few together to make a couple extra workstations. The goal has been to pair a 27\" mid 2010 with a 21.5\" mid 2010, using the 27\" as the primary machine since it has much better specs. Both machines have mini DisplayPort, rather than thunderbolt, and are connected with mini DisplayPort cables.\nThe problem I'm running into is in pairing the machines, the 21.5\" imac becomes primary machine and I can't seem to reverse this using Target Display Mode. I can toggle between the machines running separately, or the smaller one acting as the primary.\nIs there something I'm missing? How do I switch them?\n\nA: The FAQ for target display mode is pretty clear on the requirements. \nYou get to bring in external video if it matches exactly the requirements. Display Port isn't the same as Thunderbolt, so perhaps that's the issue. You also need the master iMac to be able to drive all connected displays.\nIf you can't use the hardware directly, consider software to merge the screens such as AirDisplay or Screen Recycler.\n", "Q: What happens during an iPhone restore I'm looking at the apticket system and capturing TSS data.

And here is a slideshow from iH8sn0w from JailbreakCon in 2012 that describes everything else that you could ever want to know about the process. The JailbreakCon link has a list of all talks and links to their videos and/or slides (if publicly available) should you be hungry for even more information.\nAs far as actually how the nonce is generated, the bootloaders have been dumped, but they're proprietary and protected by copyright law, so publishing their contents is illegal. You can, however, dump them yourself, and investigate on your own.\n", "Q: SSH keys added using \"ssh-add -c\" not prompting for confirmation Using OS X 10.11.1 I'm hoping to run a setup where my SSH keys are adding using ssh-add -c and when the ssh agent is requested to use a particular key I receive a dialog asking for permissions (i.e. ssh-askpass).\nI'm unable to get anything other then keys adding via ssh-add -c just not seeming to work at all. I can add the key and confirm the key is added via ssh-add -l, but when I go to connect to a host I eventually end up a password authentication.\nI've installed XQuartz and have a DISPLAY env var set, as well as having tried setting the SSH_ASKPASS env var with a path to an executable applicable for that. The executable doesn't seem to be being executed when I attempt the ssh connection though.\nI've tried a few rounds of killing ssh-agent and re-adding keys with the env vars set with no luck.\n\nA: The problem was that the SSH_ASKPASS env var wasn't available to ssh-agent when it started.\nI had tried to set this using launchctl setenv, but that did not appear to persist during restarts.\nI used this answer here (even though I'm using El Capitan it worked fine) to call launchctl setenv on every boot, before ssh-agent starts.\nSetting the system-wide PATH environment variable in Mavericks\n\nA: James,\nAre you attempting to run before you can walk?\nI'm assuming you are using the Mac app Terminal\nHave you successfully run ssh-agent and then successfully run ssh-add without the -c argument and then successfully used those credentials to log in to somewhere?\nIf so then you might be ready to think about using the -c argument.\nFirst thing to note is that if you are relying on an X11 program to pop up the dialog required then you will have to be running in Xterm, rather than Terminal, as an X11 program will have a hard time passing back the information to OS X.\nI'd be interested to know your use case.

I've tried countless times to fix this but nothing has worked. Any suggestions on how might I fix this?\n\nA: If you are sure that you downloaded the app installer from the official/verified source and that it has not been tempered with, you can skip the verification process altogether by removing the extended file attribute that causes FileVault to attempt to verify the application. Do this by executing the following command from terminal:\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/app_name.app\nThe app_name.app is the name of the application you are changing the extended attributes on. In this case, GTA5.app.\nThe xattr command allows you to view and change extended file attributes. The -d flag indicates you are deleting the com.apple.quarantine attribute which is set on the application package. Any file with the extended attribute of com.apple.quarantine is verified by FileVault. This attribute is typically automatically set on downloaded files and files extracted from a tar or zip archive.\n\nA: This verification ensures that the application is not tampered with, so I would consider re-downloading and re-installing any app that fails to verify.\nIf you have an installer package and you're sure it validates by checking the checksum or you have a backup and no data that would be sensitive if it's compromised - you can force the installer to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*.pkg for installer hangs on verify\nBut - again, you are disabling a safety feature, so I would back up your machine and data in case there's something going on with the safety system.\n\nA: EDIT: It seems I had some fw rules on my router that blocked access to some apple servers (I set them up to run some tests a while ago). After removing the rules, all is well. \nJust disable your network connection temporarily. I believe somethings's wrong with Apple's way to query their servers for potentially malicious software definitions.\n\nA: I had this problem many times lately (Mac OS quality degrading)... Here is a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app\n\n*navigate to the installer that is stuck, and install it\n\n\nA: Well I had the exact same problem with it on my mac book air.\nI kept opening it and it would keep saying \"verifying \"GTA 5\".\nWhen I went go to the bathroom it opened by it's self. \nI'm pretty sure this is dew to the large file sizes and it taking longer to work, as minecraft and league of legends verified almost instantly.\nI suggest Waiting up to 5min and come back see if it is still verifying and it might be done. \nI hope this helped you when downloading GTA.\n\nA: This seems to be the answer:\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_mac/office-2016-for-mac-cant-get-past-verifying/5b001c4a-611d-421a-b2ec-9632ae6271cc\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: iphone icon won't show up in itunes I upgraded iTunes and now my iPhone won't show up in it.

The funny thing is that if i log into Windows 10 I can easily acces everything from the mac drive. What can i do to make the BOOTCAMP drive appear and be accesible? \n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I had this issue too...  \nIt turns out, the disk was in hibernation mode, and Paragon may have been responsible.  In the System Preferences pane, go to Paragon NTFS, Volumes Tab, and check the box (Bottom left) that reads : \"Disable Paragon NTFS for Mac\".  This is what worked for me.\nAlso, on startup you may get a Paragon notification that says the disk is in hibernation.  Click on that notification before it disappears and another dialogue box will come up that lets you force a mounting of the disk.  This warns you that you will loose temp info from hibernation mode (which is not a big deal).

(I have the latest firmware)\n\n*What is the maximum speed of the Express, given the \"Draft N\" specification?\n\n*If I buy the newest Express with 802.11ac, what kind of speed can I expect?\n\n*If I also buy the newest Mini with 802.11ac, what kind of speed can I expect?\n\n*Is there anything else non-evident that would get in the way of optimal speeds?\n\n\nA: If working to transfer between two Apple machines, you should know that other connections can be used: you can simply use a Ethernet LAN cable, and plug directly into the network port on both machines (using dongle if necessary). You do not need to use a 'patch' cable, as the network ports will self-configure properly. You can also use USB-C, Firewire or Thunderbolt as network connections. All of these options are far faster than using pretty much any WiFi. \nFor using other cables, its best to use Apple's Migration Assistant. You can also use Target Disk Mode, which allows you to simply mount the other Mac hard drive on your new Mac.\n\nA: 1) What could possibly explain the ridiculously slow transfer speed of 1 MByte/s?\n\n\n*\n\n*What kind of files are you transferring? Many small files will be much slower due to seek times. Try copying something like a big movie. also, how's your signal strength? If you option+click on the wifi icon, it will tell you your connection speed, type, and signal strength.\n\n\n2) Can the speed be improved by software adjustments? (I have the latest firmware)\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard to say - probably not unless you're running some version of the OS with a known wifi bug in it (Yosemite had some)\n\n\n3) What is the maximum speed of the Express, given the \"Draft N\" specification?\n\n\n*\n\n*Max theoretical is 150 I believe. Sounds like you have an old express with only the 2.4 ghz band.\n\n\n4) If I buy the newest Express with 802.11ac, what kind of speed can I expect?\n\n\n*\n\n*It's almost impossible to answer that question, other than to say \"better\". Other than the hardware, there's all kinds of considerations including things like what kind of land line phone do you have, how many neighbors also use wifi, and what are your walls made of.\n\n\n5)If I also buy the newest Mini with 802.11ac, what kind of speed can I expect?\n\n\n*\n\n*Same as above, but I suspect that it will be even better than the case in #4. You'll be going to the 5 GHz channel (and i'm assuming doing pure AC, not mixed AC/N mode.) This has greater throughput and less interference (at the cost of worse wall/distance penetration). And of course the AC mac mini can send at a faster rate.\n\n\n6)Is there anything else non-evident that would get in the way of optimal speeds?\n\n\n*\n\n*A lot of the stuff I mentioned in #4 apply. Interference is a big one.

I'm unsure whether this was possible in OS X Yosemite, however OS X Mavericks has a security flaw in which : Should a individual have physical access to a computer, he need only launch in Single User Mode, mount the hard drive and remove the file \".AppleSetupDone\" in the Directory \"/var/db/\". In doing so, tricking the computer into thinking it is its first ever launch and allowing the individual to setup a new Admin account.\nOS X El Capitan apparently has this new security feature known as System Integrity Protection, which limits root access to an array of Directories including: /system, /bin, /sbin, /usr, /etc, /tmp and /var.\nMy Question is:\nWill System Integrity Protection protect the executable .AppleSetupDone from deletion, and the subsequent exploit?\n\nA: No. .AppleSetupDone isn't an executable, it's just an empty file. SIP does not include /tmp or /var. These are directories that need to remain write able during normal use.\n\nA: If you'd like to prevent a user from performing this attack, you can add a Firmware Password. By doing this, you prevent booting into Single User Mode without entering the password, and from booting from an external device. System Integrity Protection does not prevent this attack. \n", "Q: Cannot add an Exchange account to Outlook 2016 on OS X El Capitan I recently installed Office 2016 on my MacBook Pro Late 2011, OS X El Capitan.

The power source is adequate and there does not appear to be any debris concerning the magnetic connector.\nI have left my computer plugged in for days on end.  Have I ruined the battery? \n\nA: I strongly doubt you've ruined the battery.\nHere are some steps to try:\n1) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 - reset the SMC as someone else suggested also\n2) unplug your power adapter from the wall for over 2 minutes. There is breaker-like circuitry that triggers when there is a fault with the power adapter (usually thermal, like if it was lying on the carpet and overheated). Unplugging for 2 minutes resets this\n3) sometimes rarely, something weird happens and the battery just needs to be unplugged/re-plugged. Don't do this yourself unless you know what you are doing. The battery in these laptops can be actually dangerous (think boom) without the right equipment. Take it to the Apple store along with the power adapter and just tell them \"it stopped getting power, please help.\" Diagnostics are free even if the thing is out of warranty. You don't have to lie about what happened if they ask - leaving your laptop un-powered for a few days is not a crime nor warranty-voiding if you have a warranty.\n", "Q: Why my iPhone 6s restore application and its user data by Internet even when I backup them by iTune? I got my iPhone 6s and transfered content from my old iPhone 5 by following Apple Support HT201269, and backup my iPhone 5 with iTunes. After I restored the backup to my iPhone 6s, it's seemed that 6s was reinstalling all my 3rd party Apps and restored its user data with Internet.\nThere are several questions that confused me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is my Apps user data saved? In my iTunes backup or in my iCloud automatically? I found that all Apple's applications restored their data including settings, and some of 3rd Apps restored their user data, but some not. How does iTunes backup my all 3rd party Apps?\n\n*Whether or not I click \"File > Devices > Transfer Purchases.\", it seemed that iTunes backup would not save any app, and will re-download them from App Store after iOS restored. But I can find all my App backup in iTunes, it doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n*How can I backup all my Apps and all their user data from old iPhone to the new one? if I need always connect usb cable when iPhone re-download Apps?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you backup to iTunes, then iTunes. If you set up iCloud backup, then iCloud. If you set up both, then both. Some 3rd party apps don't restore, as the developers may have specified that user files shouldn't be backed up.\n\n*iTunes keeps apps in a separate location than iOS backups. Apps don't get copied over each time you backup, as that would consume a lot of space\n\n*Backup your old device to iTunes or iCloud. Then when setting up your new iPhone, choose either restore from iTunes or iCloud (depending on which you backed up to).\n\n", "Q: Drive does not stay mounted I created an encrypted RAID 0 disk following Why doesn't FileVault work on a RAID volume? on a WD My Passport Pro\n$ diskutil cs createLVG TimeMachineLVG disk5\nStarted CoreStorage operation\nUnmounting AppleRAID set at disk5\nAdding disk5 to Logical Volume Group\nCreating Core Storage Logical Volume Group\nSwitching disk5 to Core Storage\nWaiting for Logical Volume Group to appear\nDiscovered new Logical Volume Group \"67A69135-A5AF-4FA3-8FC1-5BD66606A595\"\nCore Storage LVG UUID: 67A69135-A5AF-4FA3-8FC1-5BD66606A595\nFinished CoreStorage operation\n\n$ diskutil cs createLV 67A69135-A5AF-4FA3-8FC1-5BD66606A595 JHFS+ TimeMachine 100% -stdinpassphrase\nPassphrase for new volume:\nStarted CoreStorage operation\nWaiting for Logical Volume to appear\nFormatting file system for Logical Volume\nInitialized /dev/rdisk7 as a 4 TB case-insensitive HFS Plus volume with a 311296k journal\nMounting disk\nCore Storage LV UUID: 37D10BDF-AF34-4252-AAD7-41D18AFFF9AE\nCore Storage disk: disk7\nFinished CoreStorage operation\n\nSo far so good.

I have an iPad Mini Retina running iOS 8.1.2.  I also have a MagicBox II bluetooth speaker.  I want to use the speaker via bluetooth with my phone, but I also sometimes use it via its AUX jack with a non-BT capable device.\nWhat happens is I will be streaming via BT from my iPad using Apple Radio, and decide to start using my speaker in non-BT mode.  I plug in my other device and the speaker switches and all is well.  But my iPad will not stop using BT, and so there is no sound.  The music app will not recognize that BT is no longer available no matter what I try.  Even turning BT off entirely doesn't help, the music app still plays but there is no sound.  Quitting/relaunching the music app also does nothing.  A reboot of the iPad will fix this issue.\nIs there any way to manually tell the Music app to stop using BT and go back to the built in audio?\n\nA: Dang, finally figured it out after days of frustration with this.  From the Airplay options when you swipe up from the bottom (whatever that little drawer thing is called), you can choose the BT speaker or iPad for the audio.  Doesn't seem to be any other place to select this from though so it was not obvious.\n", "Q: MBPr with El Capitan freezes at or right after login Here's the problem: my colleague has a MacBook Pro Retina with El Capitan installed and he's been having issues with regular freezes lately. Everything has worked fine under Mavericks for well over a year, then it was upgraded to El Capitan, worked mostly fine for some time and then started to hang up regularly.\nFreezes happen on/during either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*the boot screen\n\n*the login screen (most often)\n\n*within seconds after logging in\n\n\nFreezes do not happen in either single user or safe mode.\nAs stated above, the machine hangs most often at the login screen. I start typing the password and bang, after a few characters it just stops responding - I cannot type anything on the keyboard or move the pointer with the touchpad. Keyboard backlight is on permanently and doesn't turn off.\nAfter booting into safe mode in /var/log/system.log I've found lots of entries like this:\nWindowServer[168]: GPU Driver appears to be hung (over 5 continuous seconds of unreadiness)\n--- last message repeated 817 times ---\n\nThe problem is reproducible on all users. Since we have a Time Machine backup and I could experiment freely, I've tried reinstalling El Capitan (keeping user files). No change. Then I wiped the system drive and did a fresh installation of El Capitan, created a user during the initial setup and crashed into the same problem, before even restoring the backup.\nHardware test (accessible by holding S during boot) was run twice and did not yield any results.\nThe disk was encrypted with FileVault before my wiping it clean. Now it's unencrypted and the problem persists, so this doesn't seem to be of relevance.\nMy questions here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What could be a possible cause of such problems?\n\n*Is there any known solution to these?\n\n*Is it possible to download Mavericks from a reliable source and installing it over El Capitan? That's the last OS X version known to work well on this machine.\n\n*What can I do to debug the causes?\n\n\nAny suggestions not contained in the questions are also welcome.\n\nA: So it's two months later and I'm a little bit wiser and would like to summarise what I've already posted in the comments and expand on that little.\nWhat my colleague forgot to tell me was that the computer had been freezing from time to time even when running Mavericks; he only mentioned freezing after upgrading to El Capitan, which led me to believe that software was probably to blame. It turned out that after upgrading the freezes started to happen more often.\nThe laptop was sent to a repair shop and the technician from there told me he discovered traces of liquid at the inside of the cover. Not enough to damage the humidity indicators which are placed inside Apple products but he said there were clear marks so the computer probably had something spilled on it - too little to wreck it immediately but too much not to have an impact on sensitive electronic parts.\nAnswering my own questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook was submitted to a repair shop where a technician diagnosed the problem as some kind of motherboard failure but he was unable to pinpoint which element was responsible for the issue. Since he wasn't sure which part he should target for replacement he suggested replacing the whole motherboard.\n\n*No known solutions to the problem came into evidence.\n\n*I was able to download Mavericks from AppStore by finding it in purchase history, as suggested by Tetsujin (thanks!). However, it turned out that software was not responsible here -- after installing Mavericks the computer hung just as willingly as it did under El Capitan.\n\n*There wasn't much more to be done before submitting the laptop to a repair shop beyond what I had done and described in the OP.\n\n\nSo if you're experiencing similar problems, it's likely to be a hardware failure, in which case you won't be able to easily diagnose it on your own and you're bound to visit a repair shop.\n", "Q: How can I change from app store Germany to App Store Spain Trying to download Pokerstars.es, but I always get German App Store and in Spain Pokerstars.eu can not be played.\n\nA: *\n\n*go to Setting and choose \"iTunes Store and App Store\" \n\n*Tap your\nApple ID and in the popup that appears tap \"View Apple ID\"\n\n*Insert your password\n\n*Tap Country/Region and again Contry/Region (if you have an active subscription as Apple Music, you cannot change the Country)\n\n*Choose the country from the list, and complete all the form that appears.\n\n*When you'll finish, you can use the Stores from that country.\n\n\nP.S.\nAll your purchased are related to the country where you bought them, so you won't find any purchase in the dedicated section, when you'll come back to your country, you'll find all your purchases.\nhere's the official article Change your iTunes Store country or region\n", "Q: Exit full screen for both windows upon leaving split view In split view, when I exit full screen with one window (by clicking on the top left green button), the other windows remains in full screen and is hidden.

On your Mac, click System Preferences > Security&Privacy > Firewall > Advanced > Deselect Log out after xx minutes of activity. This will stop iTunes switching off even though your Mac is in sleep mode. If the number of minutes in the prior selection equals the time at which the connection is lost, this is probably your problem.\n\nA: This is not a complete answer, and I will update it once I have a Mac in front of me, but basically you will need to take a good hard look into your System Preferences, specifically the Energy Saver options.\nThere should be an option in there called Wake for Network Access, and it may help to check this box, however, I think that mostly has to do with accepting a \"magic packet\" for WOL (Wake-On-LAN) access -- but I could be wrong, and it could solve your issue immediately.  Not quite sure on that specific option, but...\nThere are a few other things you can do in order to prevent this type of behavior:\nYou can edit your power preferences so that your computer never sleeps, however, this will obviously decrease your battery drastically if you are not connected to power.\nYou should also be able to create a custom power profile (I'm sure it's available is OS X, although I have personally never created one like I have in Windows)\nDownload a third party application to run only while you need this functionality available -- which is keeping your computer awake -- the root cause of your issue is that whenever you computer goes to sleep, WiFi access is automatically turned off until the computer is woken up.\nThe third party apps that I know of are called InsomniaX and Caffeine.  I used to use InsomniaX with Snow Leopard, and it worked great.  Caffeine is available in the Mac AppStore or the developer's website, which I linked in the name, and I think InsomniaX is available in the HackStore or from the developer's website, which I also linked in the name.\nThat being said, the best solution, IMHO, would be to double-check your Energy Saver options, and then whenever you want this functionality available to your other computers, just hook your MBP up to power and Ethernet.\n", "Q: How can I reset the 'get info' preview image of archive utility?

This also shows the same on my iPhone.\n As you can see, Backups still takes up 3.86 GB of space, even though I deleted it (because i had no space left to backup, deleting the current backup usually allows me to do a new full backup). What can I do to restore my iCloud space?\n\nA: This might be a little late but I had the same problem. Went to the genius bar and they said to call Apple Care. I called Apple Care three times. The first two people said that there are other item which could be taking up space and couldn't provide a solution. The third one was more experienced and fixed the problem within minutes. She had access to the \"iCloud support tools\". This is a tool the Apple iCloud team has access to (but we as consumers don't). She used the iCloud storage repair kit and within minutes, my devices refreshed and the free space showed up. Apparently this problem occurs when you upload a file, it gets corrupted, then once deleted, iCloud doesn't recognise the space as being free. Hope this helps.\n\nA: There are other things besides apps that use up iCloud storage space.   The biggest is iMessage.   If you have conversations you haven't deleted in a while, especially ones with pictures, those take up quite a bit of space as part of your backups.   \nAlso, it appears you have your mail backed up to iCloud as well (based on your screenshots).   Mail takes up space as well...  especially if you don't delete all your mail, or clear it from your trash.\nMost likely, though, you haven't deleted your messages in some time and those are taking up the majority of your backup space.\nEDIT - Also, since iMessages doesn't show up in the backup section (even though it is backed up), if you are curious as to how much space your messages are taking up, on your iPhone you can navigate to Settings -> General -> Storage & iCloud Usage -> Manage Storage (the one at the top under Storage).   From here, it will show how much space each app takes up on your phone.   Whatever you see here for messages, that will also affect your backup.\n", "Q: unable to install software update in macbook I am trying to install software update in macbook, but when it says downloaded completed and you need to restart your machine, I press Restart button but my machine does not restart, it just gets freezes; when I try to restart it from Apple menu it restarts but when I try to restart when software updater asks to restart it, it does not restart and blank screen appears without dock and topbar; just wallpaper appears.\nI am new to Mac OS.

When I look in the system.log I find: \"The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error -67062.)\" i.e., Code object is not signed.\nCorrect, exiftool is not signed, and there is nothing I can do about that.  I had to bypass Gatekeeper to install it in Yosemite (10.10.5).

Something is causing my system.log to report 'Code object is not signed' with some frequency, and after further examination, I began to suspect it wasn't my Automator script because they were generated even when I wasn't attempting to run Automator.\nError 1: in my DO loop I pasted in curly quotes, that was generating the shell script error. By replacing them with standard \" quotes, the shell script error went away.\nError 2: I had set Pass input as stdin, it should have been as arguments \nBonus: Phil, the author of exiftool, who found these answers that had defeated me, suggested a single line that is more efficient than my DO loop and it works very well:\nexiftool -overwrite_original -AllDates-=1 \"$@\"\n\n", "Q: iCloud for Windows can't upgrade, uninstall, or repair. How can I proceed? Lately Apple Software Update has been popping up with a recommended upgrade to iCloud 5.0.

That kills the installer completely, before it has a chance to \"roll back\" the install. After that I found that the icloud app was installed and I could open it. \nHopefully this is fixed by Microsoft or Apple in a less kluge-y way, of course.\n\nA: Here's my solution. Having researched all of the error messages and taken a deep dive through all of them, it seemed (on my system at least - Windows 7 64 bit) that the problem was due to a lack of the Visual C++ 2015 runtime, which should be installed and which the iCloud installer seems to assume is present.\nI ran a complete Windows Update, then manually installed both x86 and x64 versions of the runtime. Rebooted, then tried iCloud again.\nResult? Worked first time.\nYour mileage may vary of course.\n", "Q: Trace file reads and writes on os x? I have something running that is syncing two directories.

I don't recall if I even tried to uninstall/re-install from a \"Mavericks bottle\", but I believe the problem actually had to do with Google updating their accepted handshake protocols or whatnot around this time.\nThe fix was easily-found by Googling and involved editing a line in the sendemail config to [I believe] remove a reference to SSL and replace it with TLS 1.1 (or something of the sort).\nI'm sure sendemail itself has been upgraded since then to account for this, because I believe I have used it successfully since then on both OS X Yosemite and El Capitan with Gmail without having to make any weird modifications to the configuration.\nIt truly is a great program, and I cannot give it enough praises.  If any of you are familiar with blat for Windows, sendemail is like that, except much more powerful and very easy to use.\n", "Q: Mac Processor upgrade I have Dual Core 2 Duo processor and need to upgrade with a newer processor. My Mac will not play videos so need to know how easily can upgrade the processor. \n\nA: Apple hardware does not use processor sockets. The CPU is soldered to the logic board. Upgrading a logic board on an older machine is only theoretically possible if there were more powerful processor options created for the same generation of machine, and then the parts and labor cost usually makes this unreasonable compared to the cost of purchasing a new Mac. You will not ever be able to use a current-generation processor in a vintage machine.\nIf you are unable to upgrade to a new computer, you may be able to find opportunity for increased performance by maxing out your system's RAM and exchanging the internal HDD for an SSD. I highly recommend OWC (macsales.com) as a resource for parts and compatibility when it comes to making these kinds of upgrades to older machines.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s not charging 9/10 times iPhone 4s, my iPhone 99% of the time won't charge arms the battery is power-draining.

I can switch the battery out in a simple minute, but I don't want to go out of my way and buy a new battery at my shop if it won't work\n\nA: Battery certainly could be bad, but there are some other common areas of failure. \nIf you shine a light into the 30-pin connector, check for any physical obstructions such as pocket lint, scraps of paper, I've even seen staples and gum. If you spot it, try to use compressed air to get it out. \nAlso look for any burnt (blackened) pins which could explain it. \nLastly look for signs of liquid. Liquid LOVED getting into those docks. Signs of liquid include corroded (green) pins, or tripped (red or pink) liquid contact indicator. The liquid indicator is in the center, under the connector plate.\nBarring any of those things, it's most likely either the battery or the charging circuitry. \n\nA: You didn't mention which iOS version you are running. With iOS 9 you can have a look at which application is using the battery the most (in Settings/Battery). \nIn general I would recommend a full reinstallation of the whole phone in such situations. But as the 4s is rather old so is probably the battery, which would explain the behavior you are seeing. Going for a new one sounds like a good idea (especially if you can replace it yourself).\n", "Q: Did something wrong with partitioning my SSD I tried to make a partition for Windows on my Mac by using Apple's Disk Utility, because bootcamp already showed me that it didn't work for some reason.

So, when I would turn the display back on, all the windows would still be in their monitor.\nNow, when the display goes off, all external monitors are shut down (?), so all windows are moved to the small mac screen and i have to drag them into position by hand.\nAny hint on how to solve this?\nI have an early 2015 retina mac book pro and El Capitan installed. My external monitors are Dells. The energy saving preferences already prevent the mac from sleeping when the display is off.\n\nA: I don't have any experience with El Capitan, but I'm on a MBP (pre retina) right now with an external monitor and when the displays go to sleep and are woken, everything is as it should be. \nIf I unplug the external monitor, all windows revert to the internal screen. Plugging the screen back in reverts the windows back to their second monitor positions once again. The change from dual monitors to single and back to dual again is obvious with the internal monitor physically blinking during the transition.\nThis occurs whether I unplug it at the monitor end, MBP end, or in between (ie I'm using a display port to DVI adapter).\nIf I turn the monitor off (via the soft power button on the front), nothing changes. \nPhysically unplugging the external monitor's power cable, also changes nothing (I actually thought it might). \nMy initial thought with your scenario is that maybe when your model monitor turns off it could physically cut the video connection (electrically) internally at the monitor.

When you to this, make sure you make a backup first of the iPhone and you have the Apple ID email and password.\n\nA: If the photos were put on to the phone by syncing them from iTunes, and/or the photos are not in the \"camera roll\", you won't be able to import them conventionally.\nIf you get the photos into the camera roll you should be able to import them.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302\nAlso give the photos app a try instead of image capture (the OSX photos app)\nJudging off the pictures, the software below seems like it might help. But given the fact that all you want is these photos, it probably makes more sense to email them or upload them to dropbox as someone else suggested.\nhttps://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/ There seems to be a pc version as well called phonetopc\n", "Q: Typing inverted question / exclamation marks in Swiftkey on iPhone Is it possible to enter these characters?

Since I'm already using the HDMI and Thunderbolt I'll have to use something else. I read in a couple of forums that you can connect another monitor using some kind of external graphics card and a USB slot.\nNow, I thought about using the FireWire slot. I found an Apple adapter the other way around but is there an adapter with Thunderbolt input that I can plug into the FireWire?\nOR:\nI saw that the new Mac Mini has a second Thunderbolt slot, instead of the FireWire. Is there a way to modify my Mac Mini to make it have 2 Thunderbolts as well?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can use a DisplayLink adapter to connect another monitor via USB; see here for the varieties available.\nThe Apple Thunderbolt to FireWire adapter only works in that direction; it will not convert FireWire to Thunderbolt. \nYou cannot modify your mini to have another Thunderbolt port. You can get a Thunderbolt dock that will give you a monitor port and another Thunderbolt port on the dock, which might also work, but is more expensive than DisplayLink (make sure to get a dock that will \"daisy-chain\".\n", "Q: Can AppleTV be used to display web page on TV?

From what I understand, any Mac produced since ~2011 should have this ability as long as it is of the Core i5/i7 ilk (the Core 2 Duos can't do this natively).\nThere is no way for the Apple TV itself to control Safari or any other apps on your MacBook Pro, however there may be an app that could do that for you, I'd check the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Finder does not update I have an issue in a folder were some files, that was recently put there by an installer, does not show in Finder.

I'm presenting a talk on troubleshooting OS X and iOS for a Mac user group next month, and I was surprised to hear that several members thought a \"hard reset\" or force restart of an iPhone or iPad is a useful troubleshooting procedure. They suggested that it does some sort of clearing of caches or resetting of [insert hand waving here] which is different from simply shutting the device off and turning it back on.\nI've searched pretty deeply across Apple's support site, the Apple discussion forums, the popular Apple news websites, and sites offering Apple tech tips and I haven't found any corroboration. \nTo clarify the answer I'm seeking, I'm particularly looking for firsthand knowledge (i.e. \"Apple told me a force restart does foo\") or a published reference that confirms one way or the other.\n\nA: The \"Hard Reset\" is a useful troubleshooting feature, because it's very often the only way to restart an iOS device that's malfunctioning. Normally it isn't advisable to do it for the same reason as on a Mac: it may cause corruption. But it's definitely a useful thing to know how to do for the times you need it. It actually does less than a regular restart, because it prevents the OS from following normal shutdown procedures. Not a great thing to do on a regular basis and there are better ways to force a filesystem check of the device without potentially causing data files to be left in an inconsistent state.\n\nA: You might find this article by an Apple employee useful: \nhttp://www.payetteforward.com/how-to-hard-reset-iphone-why-its-bad/\n\nA: First-hand experience (yes, in 2021): I was facing some issues charging with MagSafe (both MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Charger). Basically, the device gets hot once you charge it to 80%, and stops charging there. Tried disabling Optimized Charging but to no effect. Also, if you keep it on MagSafe at 80%, does not charge but instead slowly drains the device – which was not in use. Drops to 79, 78, 77, 76% etc.\nStrangely, Lightning cable charging still works.\nDevice restarts did not improve the situation, already on the latest version of iOS (confirmed to support MagSafe accessories). I might not have done factory reset in quite a while.\nI gave it a shot going to Apple Support chat, hoping I won’t get turned down or told to do a factory reset (unlucky, this happened just after the 1-year warranty coverage ended). Basically was told to try this!! Press volume up, press volume down, hold the sleep/wake button till you see the Apple. It worked. The device immediately charged to 100% as expected, the next few days it was back to fine again.\nHere’s the advice, pasted verbatim:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and quickly release the volume up button.\n\n*Press and quickly release the volume down button.\n\n*Press and hold the side button until you see the Apple logo.\n\n\niOS: 15.1\niPhone 12 (i.e. the first iPhone line built for MagSafe)\n\nA: A force restart is at the hardware level, not the software level. This means that even if iOS is completely frozen or in a different mode altogether (such as DFU Mode, Recovery Mode, or Restore Mode), you can still perform a force restart. It does nothing more than cut the power and turn the device back on again. This means that it doesn't clear any caches or reset anything. A regular restart actually does more than a force restart.\n", "Q: Messed up 1TB Fusion Drive Partitions (on iMac 5K) Alright, so I did something stupid today, and I really need some help right now…\nSo kinda like the situation in this post I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 1TB iMac (with BootCamp), I messed up my 1TB Fusion Drive while installing Windows 10 in BootCamp.

The two unnamed parts (138.62 GB and\n99.9 GB) are no partitions but unallocated disk space.\nTo remove the second EFI partition (and expand Macintosh HD) you have to boot to Internet Recovery Mode or an OS X system on an external device.\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive/external disk containing a full system (Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan).

Even after deleting the last line that moves the PNGs and original SVG to the trash, nothing appears on my desktop.\n\n\nAny help will be GREATLY appreciated!\n\nA: You have probably customized the command search path environment variable PATH to locate convert because it isn't installed in a standard OS X location.\nWhen the Automator shell-script action runs a script it uses a non-interactive shell, which means it doesn't execute files like ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. This means it uses the default environment and default command search path.\nMoreover, it is a best-practice for shell scripts to use absolute paths for command executables so the script will always execute the one you intended, instead of relying upon the search path, which is primarily meant to be a convenience for interactive use of the shell. To discover the absolute path to the convert command, run which convert in a shell.\n\nA: @Chris Page offered a perfectly acceptable answer, because it addresses all of your necessary issues, but then I took a second look at your code and wondered why not use a function with a loop instead of all those variable commands?\nink() {\n  square_dimension=\"$2\"\n  infile=\"$1\"\n  /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape --export-png \"${root}/test_${square_dimension}.png\" -w ${square_dimension} -h ${square_dimension} \"$infile\"\n}\n\nfor i in {256,128,64,48,40,32,24,16}; do ink \"$1\" \"$i\"; done\n\nNote that the above code has not been tested, and it is not your complete script, just a snippet that will replace the majority of your code.  I will update after I have had a chance to test it, but it looks good to me.  You may need to export the function or something (export -f ink) or mess around with the argument variables -- but like I said, I will post an update after I've had a chance to test it.\nAlso, like I said before, @Chris Page offered an answer that pretty much answers your question.  This is simply additional info that is better formatted as an answer rather than multiple comments.\nAlso, it's best practices to always use lowercase variable names in shell scripts so as not to overwrite any of the built-in environment variables (which is something that I have struggled with, because the variables are so much easier to recognize -- especially in a large script on a system without a colored terminal for syntax highlighting).\n", "Q: Unable to post video preview for iOS app I am unable to submit the video preview of my app.  Length is ok and the upload is accepted followed by the message \"Your file could not be loaded.

It could be your expectations are higher than the hardware can perform or it could be a really bad glitch and something that's clearly defective. I've seen both in the past, so I'd focus on getting the hardware power logs and the start up chain / logging / issue and the rest might be a moot point if the SMC isn't starting the hardware reliably. Assuming a problem there, whatever repairs that will replace the GPU/CPU/SMC in all likelihood.\nLastly, portable Macs do not have an automatic \"power on\" after electricity comes back on, so you could test that the Mac is still functional after a low battery event by letting it run down and schedule a start up or wake for a time when you know you will have it plugged in to power after it shuts itself off. If you're close to an Apple store, have them do the service, but if you really want to triage this yourself, that's how I might start figuring what's up with the SMC and power state after a low voltage shut down and reconnect to power.\n\n", "Q: How to list all files with Finder Comment using unix?

It won't replace anything you downloaded from brew already - it will just get you a stable install package and the ability to take the next step (perhaps).

I know iCloud storage is confusing and I still don't understand how it all is supposed to work, but there has to be a way to view these photos, right? I can't even go to icloud.com on the phone because I get a watered down mobile site.\n\nA: The app to use for viewing iCloud photos is the Photos app and not mobile Safari (or any other web viewer).\nTap on Photos and then go to the shared tab. All the photos you have access through over iCloud should be there.\nIf not, open the settings app and check the settings under iCloud -> Photos and that you're actually logged in with the same Apple ID as you are using to upload the photos. If you can't do that, be sure to invite the AppleID you use on the iPhone to see the shared photos from the uploading account. For most people, the account is one and the same, but you don't have to do it that way if you have reasons.\n\nA: When using iCloud Photo Library, it could take a little time for photos to be distributed throughout your devices because the photos have to upload to your account first, and then be added to your devices. Upload speeds are far slower than the download speeds were used to when using the internet. \nGlad to hear that they made it there. Obviously, you have it setup correctly. I think it's a great system. Just make sure you have the proper iCloud room to hold whatever size library you have.

I now can run iMovie 9 and the latest version of iMovie at the same time. I need the older version of Safari for web development.\nI think the only way for me to do this is to copy it from another older mac or find it online. To have an older version or newer version of an app, just select the app and do command-c and to paste it do command-v. To prevent your copy from being updated, copy it to an external drive.\nIf someone is still running a version of OS X between 10.7 and 10.10, you should have the versions of Safari I'm looking for.

If you don't have the tools and include files installed, you should get a prompt to install the tools and have to possibly type an admin user/password.\nNext, you could dig into the actual specific error log or you could try getting a gcc compiler instead of using Apple's llvm.\nbrew install gcc\n\nThat would get a gnu gcc-5 installed in the /usr/local/bin path and if that's used over Apple's /usr/bin/gcc you might not have the build error in the first place.\n\nA: Start Xcode, select 'Preferences', then 'Locations'. You'll notice a dropdown control at 'Command Line Tools'. Select the newest version, close the dialog window, then call brew again.\n\nA: After doing \nxcode-select --install\n\nrun \nopen /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg\n\nThis worked for me.\n", "Q: How to install OS X Yosemite on MacBook (with empty hard drive) from Ubuntu or Windows? Every time I search for how to create and install OS X on a MacBook from Windows I get a lot of Hackintosh videos, videos saying to use a Mac to create the installer, or even how to install in VirtualBox which are not what I want to do. \nI have a late 2010 MacBook that has no operating system on it. I know I can install and run Yosemite on it, but I don't have a spare Mac to create a USB installer. \nI'm currently using Windows and Ubuntu. My MacBook's hard drive is empty and I'd like to be able to create the Yosemite installer on either Windows or Ubuntu to install Yosemite on my Mac. \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nEDIT:\nI purchased a USB installer from eBay. I got it in the mail today and when I tried installing from the USB it dropped at some package file. I now have a Recovery HD drive with Reinstall OS X as an option but after I sign into App Store it says, \"This item is temporarily unavailable. Try again later\". Same problem over and over all day..\n\nA: You can possibly do an Internet Recovery with a new drive. Press Command + R on start up:\nFrom Apple's website: \n\nNewer Macs include the ability to start up directly from an Internet-based version OS X Recovery. Your Mac automatically uses this feature when the Recovery System on the startup drive isn't available. For example, if your startup drive encounters an issue, or if your startup drive has been replaced or erased. Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's servers. Starting up from this system performs a quick test of your memory and hard drive to check for hardware issues.\n\nIf this doesn't work, taking it to the Apple store will be your best bet. \n\nA: A little Googling provides a link to, appropriately, this question @ AskUbuntu. This solution is for Mountain Lion, so perhaps a bit of sleuthing on your part can find out if it's applicable as-is for Yosemite, needs a little tweaking to work, or just won't work at all.\nI don't Ubuntu, so YMMV with this link.\n", "Q: brew not linking gcc after install?

These instructions say:\n\nIf you have followed those instructions then you've installed three\n  packages.\nfuse_wait just replaces a single file of the NTFS-3G install with an\n  updated version. So you don't really need to do anything to uninstall\n  this package; when you remove NTFS-3G it should automatically remove\n  that updated version.\nTo remove NTFS-3G either open the NTFS-3G preference pane and click on\n  the Uninstall button, or run the script at\n  /System/Library/Filesystems/ntfs-3g.fs/Support/uninstall-ntfs-3g.sh.\nTo uninstall FUSE for OS X open the FUSE for OS X system preference\n  pane and click the Uninstall button.\nIf the two preference panes are still there after running both\n  uninstalls, then just right-click on them and select the \"Remove ...\n  Preference Pane\" option.\nAnd reboot your Mac.\nTo confirm that the file are gone you could run the following commands\n  in Terminal. Hopefully you shouldn't get any results.\npkgutil --pkgs | grep fuse  kextstat | grep fuse\n\nBut when i run \"pkgutil --pkgs | grep fuse\", i always get the result \"com.github.bfleischer.pkg.fuse_wait\". How can i solve this?\n\nA: I don't think this is a problem.\nThe pkgutil command is just telling you that the fuse_wait package has been installed on your Mac. If this is the only result from that command then it means the other fuse packages have been uninstalled, and since the fuse_wait installer only replaces one file in the fuse install that file has likely been removed from your Mac.\nAlso if you are running the kextstat | grep fuse command from the linked answer and getting no results then it further confirms that fuse is no longer running as part of your Mac.\n", "Q: How can I disable all audio output from my OSX machine when the screen is locked Essentially, I often forget to turn the sound down/off when leaving my OSX machine for the day. Since my computer is in my living room, I inevitably get a notification of some kind while watching TV, and have to laboriously get up and turn the sound off. \n(Note that I basically never shut it down, I always just use a sleep corner.)\nIs there a setting for disabling audio output entirely when the computer is asleep?\n\nA: I figured out you can do this with the \"Do not Disturb\" feature in System Preferences -> Notifications. I actually had it turned on, but had the checkbox with \"From XXX to YYY\" time checked. I unchecked that, and made sure the \"When the display is sleeping\" was checked, and that seems to do it!\n\nA: Option + Click on the Notification Center icon (the latest on the right in the bar) in Menu Bar will disable all kind of notification.\nHere's the official article Turn off notifications\n", "Q: Terminal floats between desktops On my mac, OS X Yosemite, if I have terminal open and multiple desktops the terminal window appears on all desktops.

I recently noticed that the Menlo font is rendered differently in OS X El Capitan, depending on the application being used. After tinkering a bit with AppleFontSmoothing, I noticed that the crucial difference was by how Terminal rendered white/bright text on black/dark background compared to other applications like Emacs, Xcode and TextEdit. While the other applications render fonts \"heavier\" in this configuration compared to black text on white background, I couldn't see any difference in Terminal. The effect is - in my opinion - a leaner and more readable text. Please see attached screenshot for comparison. \nExample: Terminal on the left, Emacs on the right side\n\nXcode and TextEdit will render the font similarly to Emacs when AppleFontSmoothing is globally set to minimal. What's going on here, is there a way to apply this in other applications as well? I think the way Terminal renders the font is a major improvement, and would like to see this in all applications.\n\nA: In OS X El Capitan 10.11 Terminal was changed to use minimal font smoothing for light-on-dark text, which more closely matches the weight of dark-on-light text with normal smoothing intensity, and makes the text sharper and more readable, opening up counters like the hollow space in the letter “e”.\nA natural consequence of this is that light-on-dark text can appear less bright than before. Users can adjust colors in Terminal’s preferences if they wish.\nUI controls (NSControl) do the same, but the standard OS X text view (NSTextView) does not, so programs like TextEdit and Xcode still draw light-on-dark text with more intense font smoothing.\n“…is there a way to apply this in other applications as well?”\nWithout some hackery to modify individual applications, they are only affected if they use standard Cocoa controls and text views.\n", "Q: How to remove bold from desktop font on OS X El Capitan I find the bold font on the desktop  takes up more room than necessary and doesn't make the text any easier for me to read. Is there a way I can remove this bold formatting independently from the rest of the system font?\nOS X 10.11.1\nMany thanks for your help\n\nA: The only option available is changing font size (upon right clicking desktop), not the font or even its color.

Both use Automator shortcuts. ]]\n\nA: Original Workaround #1:\nThe first one here has got the advantage to use only one Automator action and allows quite precise settings of the resulting Safari-owned window. Its end results are a \"service\" in Safari's menus plus a keyboard shortcut.These components are involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari's \"Download.plist\" (in: Library/Safari)\n\n*A shell script running cat & sed, filtering the plist-file's input into \"Downloads1.html\"\n\n*An Html file \"Downloads2.html\" holding Html tags of your choice (w/o finishing tags: </...)\n\n*An AppleScript containing a \"do shell script\" command, \"telling\" Safari to open an\n\n*...

Save it as \"workflow\".\n\n*You can then create a shortcut (e.g.: opt-cmd-d) that will run it instantaneously (System-Prefences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Services).\n\n*My solution is not really sophisticated, but I learned (glimpsed) a lot about sed, awk, cat and AppleScript/Automator.\n\n\nA: Workaround #1\nAs so far no answer explained how to programmatically influence Safari's pop over window:\nUsing only Automator\nHere is a way to get a \"Recent downloads\" list displayed, which uses only Automator.\n\n\n*\n\n*You needn't use AppleScript here at all. Instead it takes 4 of Automator's modules to run.\n\n*It will pop-up a nicely framed (Automator-style) browser window.\n(You'll need to place a \"Downloads2.html\" file, containing your html tags w/o end-tags, inside /Users/[myName]/Library/Safari, though.)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After opening  File > New > Service in Automator, double-click:\nAutomator … Do shell script\nNext, paste the following code into the window on the right side:\n# only if needed, place as 1st line: LANG=C; LC_CTYPE=C; LC_ALL=C;\n\ncd /Users/[myName]/Library/Safari;\ncat -su Downloads.plist | sed -n  '{ s/.*Downloads/<p>D`load => / ; ¬\n      s/otrkey.*/otrkey/ p; s/.*Trash/<p>Trashed => / ; ¬\n      s/.*Movies/<p>Movies =>  /;  s/mp4.*/mp4<p>/ p; }' > Downloads1.html;\nrm Downloads.html;\ncat Downloads2.html Downloads1.html > Downloads.html;\n\n\n*Double-click Pause from Automator's list of actions.\nI chose 0.1 / Seconds but had to check the Ignore input from this action button (Options). I found that on my computer Safari would display an empty window if I didn't grant the next action a pause…\n\n*Add Get Specified URLs from Safari's action list.\nRemove any given URLs and choose the [ADD] button. Then write:\nfile:///Users/[myName]/Library/Safari/Downloads.html\n\n\n*Finally, the last step is to double-click Website-Pop-Up from Safari's. My parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Site–size: Custom\n\n*Values: 600 x 300\n\n*Position: Centered\n(Safari's focus will remain on the front window, so you can't press \"ESC\" to close the pop-up.)\n\n*You might add: System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services;  (e.g.: opt-cmd-d).\n(Have a look at the resulting window at \"Original Workaround #1\" further up, as both examples use identical Html files for their looks!)\n\nA: Workaround #2\nMy preferred solution uses applescript to access \"Downloads.plist\" directly (no shell scripting), and places a link in Safari's favorites bar for your convenience.\nFirst you save these scripts into \"~/Library/Scripts/Folder action scripts/\" folder, next you attach them\n(context menu: configure folder actions) to a new \"Folder1\" somewhere deep down on your Mac.\nTo activate them, you will address a (meaningless) dummy \"Folder2\" inside \"Folder1\" thru this bookmark:\nfile:///Path/to/first/Folder1/Folder2   [place link in your favorites bar!]\n\nNow, what's happening:\n- The clicked-on toolbar link will open \"Folder1\" because the called upon \"Folder2\" is inside.\n- Thus BOTH attached scripts are launched, #-1 closing the bookmarked \"Folder2\" window...\n- ... next ordering \"System Events\" to get all of Safari's \"DownloadEntryPath\" items.\n- These paths are shortened to name plus parent-folder and collected into a \"dialog alert\".\n- (Waiting for \"dialog window\":) #-2 script immediately on pop-up moves it to the top-right.\non opening folder this_folder\n    tell application \"Finder\" to close front window\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set the plist_path to \"~/Library/Safari/Downloads.plist\"\n        set the plist_file to property list file plist_path\n        set downloadItems to property list items of property list item ¬\n            \"DownloadHistory\" of plist_file\n        set DL_display to \"\"\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"/\"}\n\n        repeat with i from 1 to number of items in downloadItems\n            set DL_item to (get text items -2 thru -1 of ((value of ¬\n                property list item \"DownloadEntryPath\" of property ¬\n                list item i of property list item 1 of plist_file) as string))\n            set DL_display to DL_display & return & \"[\" & ¬\n                text item 1 of DL_item & \":]\" & return & text item 2 of ¬\n                DL_item & return\n        end repeat\n\n        tell application \"Finder\" to display dialog DL_display as string ¬\n            buttons {\"Close\"} default button 1 -- NEW: tell appl. \"Finder\" to\n    end tell\nend opening folder\n\nIf you attach this 2nd \"folder action script\", it'll move the \"dialog\" to the right/top of your screen:\non opening folder this_folder\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set screenRgt to bounds of the window of desktop\n        set rightEdge to (item 3 of screenRgt) - 425\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n        repeat while not (exists window \"Recent downloads\")\n        end repeat\n        delay 0.1   -- wait (and make sure...) for \"dialog window\" !\n        set position of window \"Recent downloads\" to {rightEdge, 61}\n    end tell\nend opening folder\n\nThe only drawback to this solution IMO is, that for a moment each the opened folder and the alert \"flash\" over your screen...\n", "Q: Itunes run whenever the windows start, how to block no run?

It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading.\"\nBy the way this is not a date time issue, date is correct on my computer.\n\nHow can I fix this? Who knows the solution, please help.\n\nA: Actually there are two known possible causes for this message the show up. \nOne is the obvious corrupted installer. \nAnother less obvious and more tricky cause can be a reset internal clock in the machine, with a resulting date which is previous to the release of the OS installer, what will trigger this message too.\nHope this can help someone. \n\nA: If you are confident in the integrity of your installation media, you can use the terminal to bypass this message completely. The below instructions are for installs performed via a bootable USB stick:\n\n*\n\n*From the top menu bar, open Applications → Terminal\n\n*Enter: installer -pkg  /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ DVD/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg -target /Volumes/\"XXX\" where XXX is the name of the disk you're installing to.\n\n*Press return and wait for the installation to say it's complete. You will not see any sort of progress display.\n\nThis allowed me to install El Capitan a couple of weeks ago. I didn't have any internet access at the time, and my Mac had a completely empty hard drive, so I was very happy that I could force the install to go through.\nI suspect that this method could be adapted for live installations, but failing that, consider creating a bootable installer and then following the above instructions.\n\nA: I have found the solution for “This copy of the Install OS X El Capitan application can’t be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading” error! \nIf you have tried changing the date / time / on a startup disk, forget about it...\nMake sure you have an internet connection about 10Mbps at least.\nWhat you need to do are as follows :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your mac.

Install & Download your OS X El Capitan in SAFE MODE.\n\n*Make sure you delete existing 'Install Os X El Capitan.app' in Application\n\n*Re-download the updates of Os X El Capitan.\n\n*After finish downloading, everything is ready to go. Success rate 100%.\n\n*You might experience the progress bar hanging around 80-90%. (Tested to let the progress bar run but no avail.)\n\n*Force Restart again.

Now let it run until you see the login screen!\n\n*When you've seen the Desktop, that means everything is perfectly fine!\n\n*Restart again and press nothing!\n\n*Now you have an updated copy of OS X El Capitan!\n\n\n** For Upgrades only **\n\nA: you could set the time with the date command, but you have to figure out the crazy format and type it in. There's a much easier way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to wifi, then \n\n*run ntpdate pool.ntp.org\n\n*you can verify the time is set correctly by running date. Mine was set to the wrong timezone, but that doesn't really matter.\n\n\nThat's all I had to do to get my install to work.\n\nA: Apple installers have a 'best before date interally'\nI just bought a used imac, and wanted to update it from Mavericks to Yosemite.  This is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> Time and Date \n\n*Uncheck set time automatically.\n\n*Set time and date to 1 January 2014\n\n*Run the installer.  No longer corrupt.\n\n*Set time and date back to automatic.\nFor Yosemite the critical date has to be before some time in February 2014.  Other updates will be different.  I think you have about 3 months after the next version is officially released.\n\nA: Follow this tutorial. This applies to the reply from @Cazuma Nii Cavalcanti. In short once you are at the first install page go to tools in the nav bar and open the terminal, in the terminal type date MMDDHHmmYY replacing the letters as follows.\nMM - 2 digit month  01 - 12\nDD - 2 digit date   01 - 31\nHH - 2 digit hour   01 - 24\nmm - 2 digit minute 01 - 59\nYY - 2 digit year   > 15\n\nonce that is done go through the install normally. I just tried it and it worked with a USB install of OS X (10.11 - El Capitan) and it worked like a charm!\nIf setting to correct date doesn't work. Set to a date just after the os release.\n\nA: I ran into this problem.  I had installed a brand new SSD; I downloaded the installer and created a bootable USB stick.  Everything looked raring to go.  Hours later...\nThe ways to resolve this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try setting the date to today's date as documented EVERYWHERE.  If the install still fails:\n\n*Use htiutil to verify the checksum.  Assuming you have the El Capitan download in the Applications folder, you can verify the download with the following command:\nhdiutil verify /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\n\n\n*When did you download the installer?  Apparently my problem was that I had downloaded the installer a number of days ago and the certificates had expired.  If setting to today's date does not work; and the htiutil command came back with \"is VALID\"; try setting the date to the date your downloaded the installer.... or possible a few days earlier.  I did that, and the install completed with no problems....\nGood luck!\n\nA: \nBy the way this is not a date time issue, date is correct on my computer.\n\nI think many people think setting the date to the current date automatically fixes the issue, but this is not the case. You have to remember the date you installed \"El Capitan OS X installer.app\" into your Application folder. For me, it was around Sept 2015. Right now is March 2016. When I got this error while reinstalling El Capitan OS X, I set the date to today's date (i.e. date 03061225616) and it did not work because I installed \"El Capitan OS X installer.app\" around Sept 2015 and the digital signature/certificates for my installer had expired by now. Once I reset the date to Sept 2015 (i.e. date 0923020415), the installation worked without a problem.\nIf you can neither remember nor correctly guess the date you installed \"El Capitan OS X installer.app\" into your Application folder, then you would have to delete it and reinstall it into your Applications folder so that the digital signature/certficates for the installer is no longer expired.\nAlso, setting the date manually in the terminal (i.e. date MMDDhhmmYY) worked for me. I heard setting the date automatically in the terminal (i.e. ntpdate -u time.apple.com) works for some people, but not for me. It most likely worked for them because they recently installed/reinstalled \"El Capitan OS X installer.app\" into their Application folder\nThis is the one that worked for me . I went to the terminal and typed \nThis as the date 0923020415\nUsing command “date 0923020415 “ and it worked . \n\nA: March 2017 Success Confirmed\nThis answer is relevant because: The solutions above did not (completely) work for me. Apple may have changed its check routine and date stamp in 2017. It offers an addition to reach a working solution.\nMacBook Pro Quad 2.4GHz i7 Late 2011, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD, original 750GB HDD. Running OS 10.8 initially. After 4 years, time to upgrade the MacBook Pro which I run as a graphics workstation through a 27\" monitor and standalone full size keyboard. Adobe CS6 and Office 360 are the major software. Hardware completed no issues (SSD into optical bay / 2 x 8GB Ram chips). For the OS I decided on El Capitan 10.11 since it is reported to have system / performance enhancements and Sierra is a step too far, turns too much off on this Mac.\nIssues on trying to do this are well documented so I wont dwell, other than to say my last App Store download was 10.8 and so I wasn't 'allowed' to download 10.11 officially, even though it is more appropriate to my Mac than 10.12. This isn't about money or subversion. I would gladly pay for an official disc or download. I simply could not get one.\nRoutine\n1) You will need the base installer application for El Capitan (which is what you would download from the app store if allowed). You can either get this off a Mac colleague (who has downloaded it previously), ebay, or Hackintosh (which is an unofficial website dedicated to running OSX on a Windows box). \nObviously certain risk involved here. Use a proven source, don't torrent. Waste of time and may be corrupt / subverted which just causes more frustration. Once you have the application put it in your applications folder.\nNote: if you are concerned, run the Terminal verification command on the installer as noted by pRose_la above (credit due). Ensure it reports Verified on conclusion.\n \nNote: The app wont work at this stage. If you launch it you will get an endless 'verifying installation' bar or the screen noted in other posts (corrupt or tampered installation). Time stamp will be out of date.\n2) Create a boot volume on an external USB Flash drive. This must be 8GB+ capacity. This is allowed by Apple and they give you the terminal code to do it here: Apple create an external boot drive\nNote: the El Capitan installer must be in the Mac's root application folder for this to work as the terminal command goes there to get it. Also the Flash drive must be formatted with a GUID partition to boot the OS (El Capitan on Flash boot drive).\nNote: there is an GUI app to do this for you DiscmakerX but its buggy and failed consistently for me with no indication to the problem (paths were correct, formatting correct).\n3) NEW 2017: this is the addition to the process. At this point, I could boot remotely to Flash drive, access terminal to circumvent the date issue, launch the El Capitan installer. However, it would always get to 99% installation and then crash, sometimes with a final message - this installation is corrupt. I examined the El Capitan Installer app (right click the installer app / show package contents) and noted a folder called _CodeSignature. I went to my 'official' 10.8 installer app and lucked out... the same folder was in there. To be clear:\nI copied the _CodeSignature folder from inside Install OS X Mountain Lion.app to the same position inside Install OS X El Capitan.app on the Flash drive. \n\n\n4) Restart the Mac with option (alt) key pressed and you will be presented with bootable volumes. Select your Flash Drive using the keyboard arrow keys and press enter. Give it 5 mins to boot up. Don't get impatient. The remote installation now went through perfectly. I have 10.11 installed on an SSD partition and updated to the latest version through Apple app store.\nNote: You still NEED TO RESET THE DATE in terminal after your Flash drive boot and before you launch the El Capitan installer to bypass the initial date certificate issue. Details in posts above, remain valid. Set mine to the day after the application download date (find this date with Get Info on the installer app itself). \nConclusion\nThis process worked for me in March 2017 on a late 2011 Mac running OS 10.8. I now intend to create remote installers for Yosemite and Maverick just in case I need them for my other Macs in future. Do I feel bad about this hack? Not really. Disappointed that I have had to go to these lengths to update a perfectly good Mac that cost me in excess of $4000... because I didn't choose to upgrade last year.\n\nA: If you get this error message it is most likely not a problem with the installer, but rather an expired certificate.  \nPlease see the article \"Previously Downloaded OS X Installers No Longer Work\".  Fortunately, there is a very easy workaround for this.\n\"...due to an expired certificate, OS X installers downloaded prior to 14 February 2016 won’t work.\nThe Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Intermediate Certificate is required for all apps in the Mac App Store, including OS X installers. When used to sign an app, the certificate enables OS X to confirm that the app has not been corrupted or modified by an attacker. This certificate expired on 14 February 2016, causing error dialogs and preventing some apps from launching. Most affected apps have already been updated with the new certificate. But if you downloaded an OS X installer in case of trouble, you may be in for a surprise the next time you try to use it.\"\nThe above article was linked from here: \"This copy of the Install OS X Yosemite application can’t be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading. | Need Help 4 Mac\"\nIf you set your Date & Time prior to the date mentioned above before installing you can bypass the hitch, and the installer works normally. Simply set it back after the installation is complete and you're good to go.  If you purchased an older OS like Yosemite before it was removed from the App Store it can be re-downloaded from the Purchases tab in your App Store account, and it should have an updated certificate.\n\nA: I encountered the same issue when performing a clean install on a new hard-drive. Most likely it was caused by disconnecting the battery in order to safely install the hard-drive. \nAfter setting the date the install was successful.\n\nA: Here's what I went through. As long as I erased my Mac and \"bootable usb El Capitan install drive\" installation process complained with verification problem I decided to reinstall \"Yosemite\" using the built-in recovery disk, then I downloaded installer for \"El Capitan\" from \"App Store\". It was not possible to install through the \"bootable usb drive\" again, so I updated to El Capitan, oddly worked. And finally I erased my Mac and repeated reinstallation for \"El Capitan\".\n", "Q: Can I reset firmware password via Find My Mac?

Is there anything I can do to fix it?\n\nA: Well, how about that.\nA few minutes after posting this question, it started making progress again. It zipped straight from 87% to 99% in a few minutes, and now it's done.\nApparently the answer is just \"wait more hours.\"\n\nA: FileVault is a very tricky thing that depends on a number of variables to execute its operations, such as the overall size of the drive you are encrypting, the type of drive (HDD [and RPM], SSD, etc.), and the amount of actual data (and type of data) stored on the drive.\nI ran into a scenario awhile back where I had to disable FileVault in order for certain processes to launch automatically at boot time without me first having to login.  I had an encrypted 1TB HDD that was 70% full.  It took FileVault nearly 4 DAYS to decrypt this volume.  So yeah, FileVault processes can definitely take awhile.\nOn another note concerning not FileVault itself, but the progress bar in general, when I upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite, the progress bar stayed at 99% saying \"1 minute remaining\" for over 2 hours.\nI think this is either just buggy handling of certain GUI processes that developers deem not as important as things that actually affect normal system functionality, as it's more of a user experience thing that gets put on the back burner as far as development and improvement goes.\nThen again (and I know this is not the same level of code that the OS operates on), but if you ever try implementing a progress bar for operations in bash (which don't already have this functionality built in, such as rsync, wget, etc.), you will discover that it is incredibly difficult to adequately estimate the \"estimated time remaining\" of certain process operations.\nLike I said before, bash is a shell scripting language, and not an actual programming language, so I can't speak for C, C++, etc., but the basic behavior I have seen in bash for progress bars is as follows (if this helps provide any insight):\n\n\n*\n\n*You have 10 processes to execute in a script.\n\n*The progress bar updates in 10% increments after each process is complete, so that after the last process completes, your progress bar will show 100%.\n\n*Let's say each process should take 1 minute to complete, so the overall estimated time for the entire operation should be 10 minutes.\n\n*Now let's say process #9 encounters some unexpected stuff that it has to handle on the backend behind the scenes (which the GUI cannot be configured to update and account for regarding the broad scope of individual system configurations, because that would really slow down development).\n\n*Instead of taking 1 minute to execute, process #9 ends up taking 10 minutes in order to resolve all of the mess that it had to deal with.\n\n*Your progress bar will be stuck at 90% saying \"1 minute remaining\" for 10 minutes.\n\n*The end result is an operation that says it will take 10 minutes, but in reality, actually takes 20 minutes with a progress bar stuck at 90% for half the time.\n\n\nThe above is just the nature of many progress bar and user-update implementations that I have encountered in the wild, and will hopefully help explain the nature of what you encountered (just on a smaller, much simpler scale).\nMicrosoft is horrible at this, as any Windows user already knows, and they have obviously taken very little (if any) steps at correcting or improving that behavior.  So unfortunately, sometimes the answer is to just walk away or take a nap, and then come back and see if anything has actually happened.  It appears that this is one thing that they have in common with Apple (or maybe, like I said before, it is just hard to account for estimated time remaining for specific types of operations).\nIt is possible in your specific scenario that FileVault thought it was almost finished and then ran into some operations on certain file blocks or something that took a little longer than originally-expected, and the progress bar was just not configured to account for this.\n\nA: I have a theory:\nIt seems that the \"optimization\" process only runs while the computer is in actual use. So, simply leaving the Mac sitting there, even with sleep off, doesn't make it progress the optimization. You actually have to interact with it. As soon as you do, the \"remaining\" time decrease quickly again.\nSo I tried this:\nTo simulate this, open Terminal.app (inside the Applications / Utilities folder) enter enter this command (followed by the Return key):\ncaffeinate\n\nAs long as you leave the Terminal window open with this, macOS thinks you're interacting with it, and the optimization process will continue its work.\nAlas, it turns out that is not helping. It seemed so to me at first, but eventually the progress estimation fall back to \"more than a day\". However, simply interacting with it made it suggest to finish sooner again.\n", "Q: How do I rearrange the order of Spotlight categories?

When I sync, any apps I have purchased recently do not show up in iTunes.  Some things I've read say it's a bug, some say it's by design.  If the latter, is there another way that I can manage apps in a similar way (i.e. see the whole list, sort by name/size/date added, etc., view sizes, date added, select which ones I do/don't currently want installed on the device, etc.)?\n\nA: Transferring apps from iDevice to iTunes is no longer supported with iOS 9, see Can't transfer purchases from iPhone to iTunes in iOS 9 for details. Using iTunes to manage app on your iDevice is still possible though, but you need to download all apps in iTunes to do that. To automate this, set the corresponding option in Preferences->Store.\n\nA: You could use a different application to manage the apps rather than iTunes. There is Apps Assist for Mac OSX to help manage all the apps. It can show you which apps you have purchased but not downloaded, duplicates and other features.\nYou can sort by Name, Version, Category or Release Date.\n", "Q: Why does setting CLICOLOR=1 not turn on colors for \"ls\"? If I do ls -G, I do get the colors. From what I understood from the man pages, if I go into ~/.bash_profile and add export CLICOLOR=1 I would then get colors by doing just ls, as \"This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.\" \nAm I understanding this wrong? Because it's not working for me on Yosemite 10.10.5 in bash with homebrew coreutils(not sure how much of that is relevant). I tried adding this in ~./bashrc but same thing. I could always just alias my ls to ls -G, but I want to do this the \"right\" way. I also tried adding export LSCOLORS=... but it didn't help either. Like I said I do get colors with -G, but I'd like to get them by default by just typing ls and not having to set an alias for it, unless my understanding of how this works is wrong.\n\nA: A few issues.\nHomebrew coreutils ls is not the OSX/freebsd ls. Coreutils is GNU, and that ls uses --colors instead of -G. -G in gnu ls means do not show groups. It does not use CLICOLOR either. There is no environmental variable to set colors for gnu ls.\nOSX's ls uses -G as a command line option, in the same way that exporting CLICOLOR would as an environmental variable.\nSo you are using the wrong variable for the wrong command.\n", "Q: Applescript - Getting Property of an Object Not Working The dictionary for Messages states that the application has a \"chat\" element which has the property \"updated\".

Will my MacBook's battery be damaged if I do not use for next couple of months?\nI bought a new Macbook Pro (March 2015) a month back. So far I have not started using it yet. It's charged and box packed as I do not currently have time to set it up for my development work.\nUpdate: It's charged 90%+ but not being used.\n\nA: These are what you need to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery works using chemical reactions, these reactions cannot be stopped but they can be slowed.\n\n*A laptop with the battery left in will continue using that battery\nvery slowly.\n\n*A battery left completely dead inside a laptop that is still trying\nto draw power will kill the battery completely.\n\n\nIf you are storing the MacBook for a few months, take better care where you store it. Place it in a case, or completely dry bag to prevent dust buildup. Even if you keep it in the box it has come with, it would be fine. \nTaking the above care, you don't have to worry about the battery.\nApple's Maximizing Battery Life and Lifespan page offers the following advice:\n\nIf you want to store your device long term, two key factors will affect the overall health of your battery: the environmental temperature and the percentage of charge on the battery when it’s powered down for storage. Therefore, we recommend the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge\n  it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully\n  discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which\n  renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it\n  fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose\n  some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n  \n*Power down the device to avoid additional battery use.\n  \n*Place your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less\n  than 90° F (32° C).\n  \n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge\n  it to 50% every six months.\n  \n  \n  Depending on how long you store your device, it may be in a low-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After it’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with the original adapter before you can use it.\n\n", "Q: Remove user account under OS X El Capitan I would like to remove a user account under El Capitan by following this recipe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Users & Groups.\n\n*Click the lock icon to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password.\n\n*Select the user you want to delete, then click Remove below the list of users.\n\n*...\n\n\nWhat happens is that I cannot select the to-be-deleted user at this point (I can only select the current account plus \"Guest User\").

In the case that I watch a class on the secondary while working on the primary and something important comes up, I would like to switch the applications displayed on both screens with one keystroke (so if I have TextEdit and Safari open on the big screen, and YouTube on the small, I want to move TextEdit/Safari to the small and YouTube to the big screen with a single keystroke).\nHopefully someone has an idea to accomplish this.\n\nA: You can set a shortcut to move among your screens. In fact, the monitor you add is just considered as another Desktop space. So you can perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts tab;\n\n*On the left menu, select Mission Control;\n\n*There will appear some options. First of all, check that the Mission Control function is enabled. There will be consequently shown some other sub-options, such as \"Switch to Desktop X\", corresponding a certain shorcut. The default one is ctrl+X, where X is the number of Desktop to switch to. You can customize this shortcut as you prefer.\n\n\nThen, you can just perform the shortcut corresponding in switching to the Desktop space you want and it's done.\nIf you don't know/remember the 'identification X' of your screen, just show your Mission Control (in my case pressing F9) and check for the Desktop number.\n", "Q: How to make USB drives connect again in OS X In the following I'll try to explain and ask in the best way I can.

I can use key code 113 and key code 107 in loop to adjust brightness I guess, but how to automate it based on application's fullscreen status?\nPreferably I'd like to be able to specify the applications (like iTunes, VLC etc.) but just detecting fullscreen would do fine.\n\nA: I'm using a little menubar program called ControlPlane.\nIt allows you to create \"contexts\". You define what evidence sources the program keeps an eye on, and when it detects the activation of some evidence source, it switches to a context and performs a set of actions that you've set it to do. It has a lot of actions to choose from, but if you don't find what you like, you can also set it to run an applescript that you've written, just remember to save the script as an application, for otherwise it will simply open the script as a text in Script Editor. I think you could try something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a context and call it \"video\".\n\n*Set the activating trigger for the context to be, when it detects that VLC is frontmost. (Haven't looked but there might be further settings for using fullscreen as the trigger). - Then, add an action to the trigger: On arrival... to the \"Video\" context.... , no delay.\n\n*Create another trigger so that when ControlPlane detects you're no longer in that context (because the evidence source such as a specific open application has become false), Create an action \"On departure... to the \"Video\" context... And set the brightness value back to normal.\n\n\nI use ControlPlane in concert with a key binding program called BetterTouchTool.\nIf I wanted to have ControlPlane change the brightness level not whenever VLC is open, but whenever it's in fullscreen, I might first create the ControlPlane brightness action thing described above but set it to never look for evidence and change context spontaneously on its own. Instead, I could write an AppleScript which would command ControlPlane to toggle that context.\nIn BetterTouchTool, I could then select VLC as the application in question and create a new keyboard shortcut for it to override what it originally has. I think  + F normally toggles fullscreen mode in VLC. In BetterTouchTool, you could assign  + F to do multiple actions of your choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle fullscreen AND run the applescript application which commands ControlPlane to change brightness.\n\n*Hit +F again with VLC foremost, and it would toggle that action set again.\n\n\nBetterTouchTool also has an action to change the display brightness so you can also just skip ControlPlane, but I explained the whole ControlPlane thing in case that you actually do want to automate something for some apps without having to press any keys yourself.\nI'm assuming that you're on a laptop or an iMac, are you? Because these brightness commands don't work for external monitors.\n", "Q: Can't unlock encrypted external drive with filevault (osx) I formated my external drive on mavericks, and then on Lion, sometimes I had to wait some time to unlock the volume.

And entering anything in there will just shake the screen (incorrect passcode). I have not attempted experimenting with 4 or more incorrect attempts in a row.\nThe workaround is to simply lock and unlock the screen once or twice and then slide to unlock. This method will unlock the phone without a password 100% of the time.\nHas anyone seen this before and can it be cured?\n\nA: It's an issue of f.lux, but it seems there's no solution for the problem. And sadly I don't think this issue will be patched soon as Apple stopped f.lux team developing the app for iOS.\n\nA: It sounds like this is a bug.\nMake a backup of your iPhone in iTunes. Reboot (shutdown and power up) the phone, then try setting a 4-digit passcode and locking the iPhone. Reboot the phone again and unlock the phone using the 4-digit passcode. Then, go into Settings and remove the passcode.\nIf this does not work (i.e. the phone prompts you for a passcode after this procedure) you are best off just backing up again and restoring. Otherwise, you should go and see Apple Support and get your phone replaced. Remember to backup first if you are! You may not have warranty anymore, but chances are if you tell them your problem, they'll just replace the phone for you.\nBy the way, just to answer your last question: I have not (yet, touch wood) but this sounds related. And I don't know if it can be cured, but give it a shot.

When I use Firefox, I can tab through buttons and other links on web pages and then use the space bar or enter key to \"click\" the link or button. Is that same feature available in Safari? I think it's something in the preferences in Firefox that lets you do this, but I don't see that option in Safari's prefs.\n\nA: Option-tab seems to do the trick.\n", "Q: How can I tell if a particular directory is connected to a remote machine? I've found various ways to check if a particular directory is mounted under NFS (here, for example), but none of them seem to work on OS X. How can I check if a particular directory is an NFS directory in the shell on a Mac?\n\nA: The command df will include a list of all NFS shares, and their mount points. If a directory's path includes an NFS mount point, it stored on that machine.\n", "Q: How can I determine what is hanging git on my OS X machine? I'm trying to do a git pull on my Mac from a local repo.  It is hanging.  My question is, why is it hanging and how can I stop it?  That is, I'm in a repo where the \"remotes\" are on the local filesystem:  \nrcook@mymachine (paraDIS_lib (master)): git remote -v\norigin  /Users/rcook/gitrepos/paraDIS_lib (fetch)\norigin  /Users/rcook/gitrepos/paraDIS_lib (push)\n\nAnd if I do a git pull then it just hangs, no progress, nothing.

On linux, I would run it under strace, but on OS X this is very hard to do it seems, especially in El Capitan with all its weird security stuff. \n\nA: Yep, occasionally this happens for me too. But it goes normal once I reboot my machine. Probably it starts to happen after update to git version 2.7.2.\n\nA: This has stopped happening to me.  I now get faster updates via remotes pointing to the filesystem such as /Users/rcook/gitrepos/paraDIS_lib than for networked ala mymachine.net:/Users/rcook/gitrepos/paraDIS_lib, which is what I'd normally expect.  I did trim the repo size using the awesome BFG-repo-cleaner tool.  But a large index doesn't really explain why network was faster than local access... sigh.  I know this is a crappy \"answer\" but I wanted to follow up with the results.  \n\nA: I created a new remote based on SSH pointing to the same repository. Tried again with the old filesystem remote and it worked. Don't know why it worked like that.\n", "Q: Why my CodeRunner mac app keep output “(B[m” before my correct output?

Actually signed firmware for iPhone 4s is IOS 9.1. Is Possible?\n\nA: No - you would need Apple to start signing iOS 7 for that hardware. Since Apple is signing iOS 9 it's not signing 8 and lower anymore. Basically, upgrading to anything but the latest is essentially a downgrade and not supported unless you've already jailbroken or made arrangements to fake out the code signing needed for an iOS update.\nBasically, you can stick with what you have or go all the way to 9 at this point.\n\nA: If you try to update using iTunes, it will attempt to update to the newest firmware supported for that device (8.3 for the 4s). However, there is another way...\nFirst go to http://www.ipswdownloader.com & download the desired firmware version for your iPhone (the download is actually from Apple). Now go to iTunes with the phone connected, go to the Summary page for the iPhone & Option-click (& I don't know the modifier on Windows) the Check For Update button. The modified click will throw a file open dialog, & you select the IPSW file you've just downloaded. Proceed as for any other update, & wait until done.\n\nA: You may be able to!\nThere's a tool called OdysseusOTA (windows version released yesterday!) that lets 4S users restore to unsigned firmwares.\nBefore you do though, you'll need to use p0sixpwn to jailbreak your device (if not already).

Every time I open Mail, it has the same message selected.  I scroll up three or four screens to the new messages, then close.  Next launch, it's on that same old message again.  It used to select the newest message on open.\nThe message doesn't appear to be corrupted.  I can read the whole thing, and it's all plain text (via a listserv that doesn't allow attachments or HTML).  I can scroll up and select/read other messages.

Rebuild Mailbox doesn't help.\nDon't want to delete this particular message, just don't want mail to make me look at it on every launch and then scroll & scroll to the new mail.\nReason?  Fix?\n\nA: A corrupted email message can get stuck on your email system, like clogged pipe in your plumbing. In my experience the problem is always one of those joke emails that has been forwarded countless times. \nWeb Access To Email\nSolution is to use the Web interface to your email provider rather than your email client app. In the web browser, find the offending email and delete. If you really need that message - put it in a folder that doesn’t sync if you can.\nThen return to your email client. Your pipes should be clear again.

It allows you to drill down from within the Terminal itself and delete stuff if you need to.\nIf you prefer the GUI method, the best application for this is DaisyDisk.  It is a paid application that offers a free trial.  It's available in the Mac AppStore and also from the link I posted to the official website.\nThere is also a free alternative, which is almost just as good called Disk Inventory X, which is available in the HackStore and from the official link I posted to its official website.\nBoth DaisyDisk and Disk Inventory X are like WinDirStat or TreeSize, if you have ever used either of those on Windows.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of a \"MacShiny\" icon from my menu bar?

I'd like to know the key pattern for the functional keys (F1, F2, F3....)\nI recently purchased a separate media controller for my MacBookPro, it has the ability to map it's buttons to certain key patterns. I'd like to define two of the buttons on it to be Previous Song (F7) and Next Song (F9). But the controller isn't recognizing the key patterns.\nI've tried just hitting the F7 key, which it doesn't recognize. I've also tried defining the key pattern as (F7 + fn-key), which it recognizes, but doesn't do anything, it just makes the \"does not compute sound\" that Mac's make.\nSo what is the correct key-pattern for specifying the functional keys at the top of the keyboard?\n\nA: From my brief research the media keys are passed as events.\nAs an alternative solution, perhaps you can use a solution similar to the one illustrated here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define the keypress you want to perform an action (Using Keyboard Shortcuts in System Preferences or a third-party application like USB Overdrive)\n\n*Write an AppleScript to perform the action you need:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    next track\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Only protecting email with a password I will be using my computer as a music device during a party, so it will be open and others will have access to it.  I do not want people to snoop into my personal email.  Is there a way to password protect just my email?\n\nA: There are a few apps out there that claim to be able to do this. iLock (http://www.osxbytes.com/ilock.html) and Mac App Blocker (http://knewsense.com/macappblocker) are two, though not free.\nCreating a non-admin account as Patrix suggested, and only using that during the party is the best solution since party-goers won't be able to see anything of yours (mail, browser history, files, etc). You'd just need to share your music with that non-admin account (this describes the process: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-share-itunes-libraries-between-user-accounts-in-os-x/).\nIf you want to use your account, the most effective way would be to turn on Parental Controls in your Settings, and only enable iTunes and maybe a browser. However this won't work if your account is an administrator account.\nIf your account is an admin account, and you want a free method of preventing someone from seeing your mail (I assuming you're using the OS X Mail app), you could rename your mail folder temporarily (Library/Mail) and then change your email password temporarily so that if someone opens the Mail app, they'll see nothing and it won't download any new mail. If you're paranoid, you could move the mail folder to an encrypted volume (created in Disk Utility) or a removable drive. But if you're that worried, using a different account for the party is easier and safer.\n", "Q: Cannot ping between OS X on wireless LAN Macbook Pro OSX 10.10.5, Late 2013 model. Firewall entirely off (Stealth mode is certainly off). Three Macbook Pro’s wirelessly connected to the same wireless network (WPA/WPA2 Personal) under the same netmask with one and only wireless router (192.168.0.1). \nMac 1: inet 192.168.0.101 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\nMac 2: inet 192.168.0.105 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\nMac 3: inet 192.168.0.119 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255\n\nIf ping each other, one will receive a permanent Request timeout for icmp_seq. If ping a random non-exist address (192.168.0.188), I get No route to host after Request timeout for icmp_seq. If any OS X ping the router (192.168.0.1), then it gets all packets transmitted and received with 0.0% loss. \nFrom the results I assume the OS X can ping router and the router tries to transmit the packet if the IP exist, \n\nA: First, it seems your wireless router seems to have some firewall part preventing ICMP messages (ping is one part of this protocol suite) going over the wireless lan to prevent a ping flood. To verify this, try out these tests:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable any VPN software you may run (VPN software mostly includes Desktop policies preventing \"unwanted\" protocols to be executed and they insert special routes).\n\n*ping -c2 192.168.0.255\nA usual behaviour for that command would be to get an answer from all your machines in the same network. If this doesn't work, something else is preventing that. As you wrote you disabled all the OS X firewalls, this command should be successful.\nTo verify this, go to step 2:\n\n\n*Take two MBP and connect them with one CAT6 Gigabit Ethernetcable and assign IP adresses to the LAN ports:\n\nMBP1: en0: 172.16.42.5 netmask 255.255.255.0\nMBP2: en0: 172.16.42.6 netmask 255.255.255.0\nMBP3: en0: 172.16.42.7 netmask 255.255.255.0\nNow try to ping MBP2 from MBP1 and vice versa and take notes:\nMBP1 -> MBP2: 1->2 yes / no, 2->1 yes / no\n\nMBP1 -> MBP3: 1->3 yes / no, 3->1 yes / no\n\nMBP2 -> MBP3: 2->3 yes / no, 3->2 yes / no\n\nIf all of these connections are working, then you know the router is the bad guy. Take a closer look in your router configuration and look there for terms like \"broadcast storm\", \"ping flood\" or \"ICMP broadcast prevention\". Switch that feature off and try it again.\nHope this helps in analysing your annoying trouble. :-)\n\nA: This may be caused by the wireless access point having been configured to prevent wireless clients to talk to each other. \nThe way to verify it (and not rely on ICMP) is to try to ping or telnet to a random port from one of your OSX machines to another one and see if an arp entry for that other machine shows up in the arp table, eg from machine with IP 192.168.0.101 run: \nping -c2 192.168.0.105\n\nor:\ntelnet 192.168.0.105 22\n\n(note, the telnet command above tries to connect to port tcp/22, which is normally used by ssh, which may not work on the target machine; that's alright, as we're only testing Ethernet/WIFI connectivity)\nAfter any of the above commands, run: \narp -an | grep '(192.168.0.105)'\n\nIf the Layer 2 connectivity is there (Ethernet/WIFI), then you should see an output similar to below: \nMacBook:~$ arp -an | grep '(192.168.0.105)'\n? (192.168.0.105) at (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) on en1 ifscope [ethernet]\n\nalternatively, if there's no Layer 2 connectivity at all (e.g. as it's prevented by the WIFI Access Point), you'll see something similar to: \nMacBook:~$ arp -an | grep '(192.168.0.105)'\n? (192.168.0.105) at (incomplete) on en1 ifscope [ethernet]\n\nFrom that point on you will at least know if the connectivity is prevented by the WIFI AP. \n\nA: A lot of wifi routers have settings that prevent devices on the same wifi to talk to each other. This is common on guest wifi networks as a security feature. On Synology routers, it is called “AP isolation” (Source)\nI know this is an old thread, but the clues here helped me solve it on my network. Definitely check the router settings and also try using at least one wired connection on the devices to determine if it is only a wifi problem\n", "Q: MacBook Pro boot issue I put my MacBook Pro to sleep at night and the next morning when I try to boot it ..

This should mount the drive.\nThen quit Startup Disk and open Disk Utility as below.\nThen you should see a menu bar with a Utilities option in it, choose Disk Utility from here and run the disk repair.\nUnfortunately, disk failure is a possibility, but it could also be corruption from the system going to sleep while in the middle of doing something.\nIf you do manage to get back into your disk, I would recommend making a backup as soon as possible, as well keeping a regular backup in general.\n", "Q: What can be with the battery? My MacBook Pro (13-inch, mid 2010, El Capitan) periodically turns off. And this is happening completely randomly - sometimes it works fine for more than a day, and sometimes turns itself off 10 times in an hour, sometimes just turns off when you turn on the laptop. TG Pro App after each shutdown displays the message \"Forced - Battery current outside limit\". The number of charge cycles: 859. Maybe I should change the battery?\nUPD I changed the battery but the problem remained.\n\n\nA: Yes you have to change your battery.\nThe Apple technician will confirm you it is beyond dead, as a dead spring (a battery is just a chemical spring with a finite life).\n", "Q: El Capitan - Right Click Menu - Open Terminal Here I know this may have been asked several times, however I cannot find a valid method that will work for me.\nOn El Capitan - I want to add a option to the right click menu (not the services section) that allows me to open a file or directory directly in terminal from the right click option. \nWould somebody be able to provide a working method?\n\nA: Here is a small tool that will do the job: https://github.com/qparis/FinderOpenTerminal\n\nA: As an addition You can add alias in Your .bash_profile:\nalias cdf=\"eval \\\"cd \\\\\\\"\\\\\\`osascript -e 'tell app \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Finder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to return the POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)'\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"\\\"\"\n\nThis will not solve your problem, but You can use existing Terminal window and cd to selected directory in Finder by cdf command.\n\nA: There are more utilities of this kind available. E.g. Go2Shell is also a possibility.\n\nA: \nAs already mentioned in comments, using the built in service definitely works for folders. As for files, if you were to open them in finder, nothing would happen unless you can first established default editors in your .bash_profile.\nIf you're not dead set on using the right click menu, one way to open a folder location or file with terminal without downloading additional software would be to drag a file or folder onto your Terminal icon in the Dock. I do this often and it works great.\n\nA: BarryMode's answer creates a sub menu item and you have to be in the parent directory for the menu item to work on a given directory.\nThis tool solves both of these issues. It allows you to open terminal from any directory while you are in the directory. The tool also allows you to write simple shell scripts to add more custom options to the right click menu. The tool is free and there is a GitHub link on the tool's page if you want to check the source.\n\nA: When I upgraded to El Capitan, I was able to open terminal at finder as I was before and never had to try to make it work again.\n", "Q: EarPods pause/play when moving I have encountered a strange behavior twice already, with two separate EarPods headsets. After about a year of using the headset, the cable near the jack gets slightly worn out and it causes really irritating behavior - when bent, it pauses/plays song while listening to music. It also hangs up a call just by bending.\nAnybody encountered this behavior? Is there something I can do or the only thing is to just throw it away and buy a new one...again?\nEDIT: \n\n\n*\n\n*Just to clarify - it is definitely not shake to change feature. I tried it with the phone being stationary and just fiddling with the cable.\n\n*This question doesn't provide any solution or answer to my question - \"what can I do\".\n\nA: Misuse is dramatically shortening the life of your cables.  \nFlexing the cable near the plug will eventually break down the cable shielding, causing electrical shorts, with random results.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, buy a new headset.\n\n*Second, either learn to treat it gently, or invest in some Sugru which is great for protecting the point where a cable meets the plug.\n\n", "Q: Removing Air Watch without removing WiFi/Exchange profiles Is it possible to do either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Air Watch from an iOS device without deleting WiFi/Exchange profiles\n\n*Backup the profile and restore it after removing Air Watch?\n\n\nA: Apple signs the profiles cryptographically so this would most likely require a jailbreak to even attempt modifying the OS code that handles chaining MDM enrollment with MDM granted Apps, profiles, shared secrets, and MDM delivered trust certificates.\nUnless there is an exploitable bug in either the MDM (AirWatch in this case) or iOS, you won't be able to accomplish either of your goals. Apple restricts the MDM technical documentation to enterprise level developers and to selected partners - even paid developers cannot generally see the details of the implementation, so I can't link to an official Apple page listing how this works.\nNow - here's what you can to to learn more about the certificates and the profile you (the end user) can control:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app\n\n*Tap General\n\n*Scroll to below Date & Time and tap Device Management\n\n*Tap your MDM Enrollment profile (and yes, this is just a file that gets emailed to you or downloaded from a web page, so you could probably download it with a computer to inspect it if your MDM endpoint is publicly available)\n\n\nYou should be able to see who has signed the profile and whether your device trusts / can verify the cryptographic chain used to sign that certificate for the date/time your device reports. These profiles generally have a start and end time bracket that automatically invalidates the profile except for a window of time.\nThe system is designed to keep you from changing anything in the file - and you can either opt in to keeping the restrictions or Remove Management which removes everything that depends on this profile in a cryptographic/mathematical sense.\nNow for the good news, you can try this management for free with one MDM solution I'm familiar with: http://www.bushel.com\nYou'll also want to watch some introductory presentations about certificates. I'd recommend the \"Let's Talk about Certificates\" by Ben Toms (a.k.a. mac mule)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.jamfsoftware.com/resources/all/jamf-nation-user-conference-2015/\n\n*http://www.jamfsoftware.com/resources/lets-talk-about-certificates/\nWarning, the last link contains humor since there are a lot of acronyms and technical jargon to be cut through that dryness with some levity. Skip to 2:30 to learn about trust and identification and whether you want to watch the entire presentation or not. And, what you ask would be like Apple and AirWatch being crew there to catch the woman in her \"trust\" fall.\n", "Q: Finding eBooks (.epub) via content on my Mac I have a lot of eBooks on my Mac. But whereas I can find any PDF on my Mac by searching their content, this doesn't work with Spotlight when applied to .epub files. \n(The only clumsy way of doing this is putting all the eBooks onto google drive. But the results are frustrating. the eBooks are treated somehow like \"Package Contents\" and only the pertaining page of the book, not the book are found.) \nAnyhow, is there a (simple) way to find eBooks by content?\n\nA: Here's an open source plugin you can use to do what you're asking.\nhttps://github.com/jaketmp/ePub-quicklook\nSimply follow the installation instructions on their page and according to the description, it will then index it for use with Spotlight. There's also a plugin for Quick Look support on the same page. To download a tested version, go to \"Releases\" and get the latest version.\nAt the time of writing this, that is version 1.7.\n\n", "Q: How does a program modify /usr but I am unable to even with admin privileges? I have just installed latest Xquartz and FSL imaging software.  I noticed that there is a new symbolic link in /usr (i.e. /usr/X11R6) to /opt/X11. My understanding was that only Apple software could be certified/signed to modify /usr under the new SIP in El Capitan.  I am certainly unable to modify /usr directly with sudo so SIP is turned on.   \nIt definitely is new - I had a previous xquartz install with a /usr/X11 symlink created prior to El Capitan upgrade which remained in place.  However, FSL needs a /usr/X11R6 symlink which I tried to create manually to no avail because of SIP.  \nAfter upgrading to latest Xquartz now I have both /usr/X11 and /usr/X11R6 symlinks.  It's not a 'problem' but I'm not clear how it got there.\nCan someone explain how this works?\n\nA: SIP disables everything (including the kernel) from modifying the specified directories. Disable it if you want to modify /usr.\n\nA: It is possible to add, remove or change SIP-protected files and directories via an installer package which is signed by Apple’s own certificate authority. This allows Apple to make changes to SIP-protected parts of the OS without needing to change the existing SIP protections.\nNormally, this would exclude Developer ID certificates, but I'm betting Apple made an exception for this particular Developer ID certificate.\n\n", "Q: How do I know if I've copied a photo from camera roll to album? Let's say I have 500 images that can be categorized in 5 albums: cars, houses, vacations, family. So I went to my camera roll, selected about 100 images related to \"cars\" and added them to folder \"cars\". Now I go back to the camera roll and I notice another picture of a car, but I'm not sure if I selected that one and copied it to the album.\nIs there a way to know what pictures in camera roll were added to an album?\nI have iPhone 5C, iOS 8.4.1.\n\nA: They won't be duplicated. Albums only reference the pictures in your Camera Roll, they aren't actually copied.\n", "Q: Option-Left/Right Arrow doesn't work The keyboard shortcuts Option-Left/Right Arrow is made for moving the cursor by words, as Apple described here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 , but doesn't work on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010, OS X 10.11).

I think some option based shortcuts can't function as usual with \"Unicode Hex Input\". You can update the input sources by searching \"unicode\" to be directed to system preferences -> Keyboard. Click \"Input Sources\" and remove other input methods that might be causing the error. Then open a new window for the program you want to test.\n\nA: Another problem here can pop up if you have a gaming keyboard.  I have a g/pc button that is activated by fn + f12 that turns this off.

I'm pretty sure there's a way to force enable Google Safe Search by editing a hosts file on my kids' Mac. Can someone tell me how?\nI'm guessing I need to sudo nano /etc/hosts \nAccording to How to: Enforcing Google SafeSearch I should use:\n216.239.38.120     www.google.com     #forcesafesearch\nIs that enough?\n\nA: I did it with Squid and Squidguard.  Add the safe parameter to the URI.  All computers in the house got their DNS and web proxy from that server.\nEven this can be defeated by using https to go to a proxy that serves the pages for you.  Then \"google\" is only in the encrypted packets, not in the URI that your local system sees.\nYou can block known proxies, but new ones are frequently created.  And Tor Browser can run from a USB drive.\nHow sophisticated are the kid's tech skills?  Are they actually trying to bypass filters?  If the answers are \"very\" and \"yes\" then you can disconnect internet completely and they'll still do it by going to a friend's house.\n\nA: That's definitely one way of doing it, but it isn't all that secure. All that's happening here is that your operating system is mapping www.google.com to the IP address you've specified in the hosts file, rather than what it receives from the DNS server. So, if your kid goes to www.google.co.uk instead of .com the hosts file won't override the request, and safe search won't get forced. \nYou can probably do it from a browser or Google Account level instead of the Operating System. Google provide lots of help on the subject:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google: Make safety choices that fit your family\n\n*Google’s safety tools\nSee the bit about SafeSearch lock:\n\nSafeSearch Lock\nIf you’re worried about others changing the Strict SafeSearch setting without your knowledge, you can protect it with a password using SafeSearch Lock. Once locked, the Google search results page will be visibly different to indicate that SafeSearch is locked.\nEven from across the room, the colored balls give parents and teachers a clear visual cue that SafeSearch is still locked. And if you don’t see them, it’s quick and easy to verify and re-lock SafeSearch.\nLearn how to activate SafeSearch lock\n\nDisabling Incognito Mode\nIncognito Mode renders the above useless, but you could always disable Incognito Mode completely.\nOn OS X, perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Chrome\n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences\n\n*In the folder, you'll find a file called com.google.Chrome.plist\n\n*Open it in a text editor of your choice\n\n*Add the following lines into the file between the <dict> tags:\n<key>IncognitoModeAvailability</key>\n<integer>1</integer>\nFor reference, 0 = enabled, 1 = disabled, 2 = forced.\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Restart Chrome. You should notice there is no option to open a new incognito window. If not, you may need to do a full system restart.\n\n\nA: Even if you do force Googel safe search, it doesn't impact Bing, or Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Another consideration is to utilize the free services of OpenDNS. Simply create an account, enable the 'Family Shield' function, and then configure either the browsers or your router to use OpenDNS DNS servers.\nYou can restrict websites, content etc at the DNS server, so even if searched, the content cant be reached. OpenDNS has categories of things to be blocked (like nudes, etc) to make it easy. \nI am not associated in any way with OpenDNS, just a happy user.

This waste of time is begging for automation, though can't figure out how to do this in Keyboard Maestro, for example.  Any ideas on how to automate this so that a keyboard trigger will open it?\n\nA: Regardless of how you are creating them, you can create a Finder window with a smart search that shows files created within the last day, and then sort that window by creation date. The most recent file you've created will be on the top.\n\nA: In your comments, you describe the problem being the need to navigate to open the file. I think I understand what you mean: there's no history in the open-file dialog, so when you use \"open file\" in another application, the location it first presents is not where you saved the file. Consequently, you have to navigate around (within the open-file dialog) to where you did save the file. If that is indeed the problem, then I suggest looking at Default Folder.  I've been using it to solve this particular problem for many years and it has worked well for me.\n", "Q: How to get user GUI input from BASH scripts? From a BASH script I want to get user input and change system settings, in a loop.  I first tried cocoaDialog but that has a fatal flaw: the dialogs are always on top of other windows.\nIdeally, I could throw up a dialog with \"set sleep mode\" and \"set awake mode\" (for toggling the \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\" setting) buttons and the dialog/window would stay put when buttons are pressed.  In the case of cocoaDialog, I had to put up a new dialog each time a button was pressed.  It would have been fine, but aside from the above problem already mentioned, putting up a new dialog positions it in the middle of the screen and not where the old one was (and cocoaDialog doesn't have positioning arguments for dialogs).\nAnyone know of a solution?

To no avail unfortunately. Apple has no mechanism for doing anything with spaces programmatically. The only facility I found is by running the defaults command and (under one of the defaults whose name I can't recall at the moment) there is an area that'll give you cryptic window numbers and the spaces they belong to. The issue is that list isn't updated live, so it isn't really that useful. I'm still searching, but I'm fairly certain there is no Apple-approved way to interact with spaces, or split screen, or any of its other manifestations.\nEDIT: Oh yes, it's \"com.apple.spaces\". Run the command defaults read com.apple.spaces in the terminal to get to what I was talking about.\nEDIT2: Also, there's a way to activate spaces with a little bit of C code:\nCoreDockSendNotification(CFSTR(\"com.apple.expose.awake\"));\nCoreDockSendNotification(CFSTR(\"com.apple.expose.front.awake\"));\nCoreDockSendNotification(CFSTR(\"com.apple.showdesktop.awake\"));\n\nEach of these lines will make mission control do stuff, not that it's all that useful.

I looked in the \"Other...\" section of apps for Terminal, but Terminal was grayed out and unelectable:\n\nIs this even possible, to add a shortcut to the menu bar in the Terminal app, and if so, how would it be done?\n\nA: You can simply add Presentation to you keyboard shortcuts list in System Preferences and that should work.\n\n\nA: At the bottom of the dropdown to choose an app, there should be an Other... option (this is for apps that are not listed).\n\nFrom there you should be able to just type \"Presentation\" into the dialog, because that is the first occurrence in the Terminal menu.\n", "Q: Esperanto and Dvorak keyboard? So, I'm fully aware on how to type characters with various accents (å, à, ø, á, ä and â) but one thing I don't understand is how to type those accents when typing in Esperanto. The circumflex, for instance, will only work with vowels (â, ê, î, ô, û) but Esperanto uses a different set of special characters. These would be ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ and ŭ (which can be described as c, g, h, j and s circumflex and u breve) and apart from copying them from other pages on the web or popping open the Emoji and Symbols panel, I am at a loss on how to type these in Dvorak and since I have near exclusively typed in the Dvorak for the last two years, I'm not really too enthused to switch back and forth to Qwerty just to type one character every so often. It, like popping open the \"Emoji and Symbols\" panel, is simply unrealistic and really breaks my flow.\nSo, any suggestions on a work around that is actually much simpler?\nJust in case you may need to know, I'm running OS X 10.11.1 on a late 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro.\n\nA: You can install a custom keyboard like Dvorak Extended, an example of which is found at\nhttp://fwvdijk.org/\nOr create substitutions for the needed characters in system preferences/keyboard/text\n", "Q: My storage was not updated I just changed my storage plan for 50 GB for $0.99 per month.

With a good wallpaper, this can look really great.\nBut apps in full screen mode have a black background, not your wallpaper.\nIs there a hidden feature or setting to set the background of fullscreen apps to a wallpaper?\n\nA: It doesn't look like there's a safe way of doing this; looking at this Apple Support Discussion answer, I can still find the referenced background image in my Yosemite install at:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/NSTexturedFullScreenBackgroundColor.png\nSince this is buried in /System, it's highly unlikely there's .plist file/attribute you could change to point to an alternative background – so you would need to replace this image file with another to change the background. As you may or may not know, editing anything within the /System directory is tempting super-bad juju and very, very, very strongly discouraged by Apple and any IT people worth their salt.\nPersonally, I would recommend that if you really want a window background image in these apps that you instead configure each app to use the background image and dispense with the transparency (or submit a feature request to Apple and embrace the restriction in the meantime). \n", "Q: What is the content of the $CLASSPATH variable in El Capitan?

But I'd settle for the ability to dismiss alerts universally. \n\n\nA: Concerning closing all alert notification via a keyboard shortcut, you have the options listed below available.

How do you take a backup of Contacts data stored in the iPhone, without using apps, and without sending Contacts data to the \"cloud\"?\nI've devised the following:\n1) Compose a new email\n2) Switch to Contacts\n3) Tap a Contact and \"Share\", then \"Email\"\n4) Select the attached VCF file and tap \"Cut\"\n5) Delete the email draft\n6) Switch to Email again (email from step 1 is shown)\n7) Tap the white area, then tap \"Paste\"\n8) Repeat steps 2-7 for each Contact\n\nYou'll have an email full of VCF attachments that you can email to yourself. And it works without apps on the iPhone nor the PC end. It is extremely manual, however.\nI found that Martin Szulecki produced a Python script to dump all the contacts into a vCard file, but the git repository has been taken down (http://follow.ourbunny.com/post/2148582357/download-iphone-contacts-to-linux).\nIt also seems like the eds-to-idevice project (https://gitlab.com/eds-to-idevice/eds-to-idevice/blob/master/lib/eti-sync.c - plugin for something or other?) is able to both send and receive individual contacts plus the entire catalog of contacts from an iPhone.\nApparently it does so by linking to libimobiledevice.so (the standard shared library for talking to an iPhone on open source operating systems), calling mobilesync_start() with an argument of \"com.apple.Contacts\" and then calling mobilesync_get_all_records_from_device().\nDoesn't come with a script though.\nDoes anyone have a simple method of retrieving all the contacts for backup purposes, with installing apps, enabling cloud storage, etc.?\n\nA: I found out you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download libplist, libusbmuxd and libimobiledevice from http://www.libimobiledevice.org/\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev python-dev cython libssl-dev\ncd libplist-* && ./configure && make && sudo make install\ncd libusbmuxd-* && ./configure && make && sudo make install\ncd libimobiledevice-* && ./configure && make && sudo make install\nsudo ldconfig\nfind tools -executable\n\n\n*There's now a \"idevicebackup\" and \"idevicebackup2\" executable which backs up the entire device.\nBut they complain about lack of disk space when I run them, so that probably means they back up everything, including enormous photos, videos and apps, which is going to take way too long.  I just need a tool that can make a quick backup of the Contacts (and maybe Notes), so that I can set it to automatically start each time I plug in the phone.\n(By the way, the above fulle backup should work on Linux, OSX and Windows, since that's the platforms supported by libimobiledevice...)\n", "Q: Alternative to Boom (volume booster) I'm disappointed to see that http://www.globaldelight.com/ are discontinuing support for Boom1 and charging users to upgrade to Boom2.

This suggests it has its own internal speakers behind the LCD panel.\nHowever, it doesn't have any audio input. So I suppose the only way must be through the data cable, which in my case is Thunderbolt -> DVI.\nBut OPT+click on the volume Icon in OSX's system tray doesn't list any corresponding audio output.\nIs there any way to get audio outputting through the monitor?\n\nA: Okay so a couple of things are at play here. First of all, DVI doesn't carry audio - so even though the Mac's Thunderbolt port is capable of sending audio, when you convert it to DVI that audio stream gets lost. This can get confusing though, because it is possible to send a HDMI signal over a DVI-D cable, which will carry audio. But that's technically not a DVI stream any more. \n\nA DVI-D source can output HDMI signals including audio (e.g. ATI 3000->series and NVIDIA GTX 200-series).[9] Some multimedia displays use a DVI >to HDMI adapter to input the HDMI signal with audio. Exact capabilities vary by video card specifications.\n\nSource: Digital Visual Interface article on Wikipedia\nThe next thing is whether or not that port is an Input or Output. I've got an LG monitor down the end of my desk that has a 3.5mm Jack on the back, but it's an output. Meaning if you plug in a source that supports audio (in its particular case, HDMI) then you can pass that audio out to a set of desktop speakers. But it doesn't have any built in.\nIf it is indeed an input, you just need a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, and connect the headphone output of your MacBook to the speaker input on the monitor. \nSomething like this would do the trick: 3.5mm Stereo Jack Cable on Amazon\nThe upshot being, you can't do audio and video over DVI connection alone.\n", "Q: Applescript for specific System Preferences pane I'm trying to write an applescript to get me to a specific section of the system preferences - Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services and hopefully to a specific service as well.

Is it now possible to do this? Do modern MacBook video outputs at modern monitors support this?\n\nA: There is no Thunderbolt to DVI adapter. You're using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter. Mini DisplayPort doesn't support anything other than DisplayPort data. USB cannot travel over this. If the monitor requires an external power supply, presumably Mini DisplayPort doesn't have enough power either. If this was a Thunderbolt monitor, it would likely still need a power cord, but it wouldn't need the USB cables, because Thunderbolt basically supports everything.\n", "Q: How can a Mac mini drive 3440 pixels wide display instead of 1920? I've bought a new 21:9 IPS screen with a native resolution of 3440x1440px. The display has only two inputs: 1x DisplayPort which is connected to a workstation and 1x HDMI port which should go to my Mac Mini (Late 2012).\nUnfortunately on the Mac, I only get 1920x1080@60hz in the system settings. Probably because HDMI hasn't enough throughput. My plan was to lower the Hz to 30. But this isn't possible. Only 60Hz and 50Hz are selectable under El Capitan.\nThe Mac Mini has two different outputs. 1x HDMI and 1x Thunderbolt/Mini-Displayport. \nDo I simply need a different hardware adapter to get 3440x1440@30hz on the thunderbolt port using a HDMI<->Mini-Displayport adapter? \n\nA: Yes. The limitation is in the adapter cable. The one you listed should work well and there are many others now like the cable matters one linked below. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/shop/product/HHLY2ZM/B/belkin-4k-mini-displayport-to-hdmi-cable-2-m-65-ft?fnode=8b\n\n*http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B00K0UDJFI\n", "Q: Can't set IPv6 mode on Airport Extreme I have a AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation) connected to a Zyxel VMG1312-B30A modem. My ISP is Deutsche Telekom with VDSL.\nFor quite some time I was able to use native IPv6. But this stopped working for me and I don't know why. I am unable to set IPv6 mode on the Airport to Automatic or even Manually! I tried both Airport Utility on the Mac and iOS.\n\nI'm getting a IPv6 Relay Error. Strange thing, with other hardware it works just fine.\nDid this change with a firmware update? What can I do to get this working again? \n\nA: If it was working before without a tunnel, the issue is almost certainly the ISP. The AirPort extreme has fairly well-developed IPv6 support, and should work fine.\n\nA: Did you change your contract? You get IPv6 only in newer \"IP-Telefonie\" contracts. Maybe you should call the hotline and ask, if it's unlocked.\n\nA: It's actually a glitch in the newer firmware starting with 7.6.3. As far as I know, there is nothing wrong with the ISP's and this error is only limited to Apple Airport products. Currently, the only way to fix it is to manually input all of your IPv6 information into the airport router.\n", "Q: OS X Server Caching / DNS Question our network has 3 primary public IPs (datacenter, user set a, user set b).  I would like to set up the Caching server, and am just trying to understand the breakdown of the DNS entry.\nIn the data portion, the  \"prs=1.2.3.4,2.3.4.5,3.4.5.6\" section: What does \"prs\" actually equate to? Peers?  If this is going into internal DNS, wouldn't I want to use the internal IP of the cache server, as opposed to the public IPs?  \nAlso, does this record assist the clients/devices, or the server itself?\n\nA: Reading the help pages I would assume that prs stands for public range comma-separated and prn stands for public range binary network-byte-order format.\nThe entry(ies) go(es) to the authoritative DNS-server which is not necessarily your (internal) DNS-server.\nThe purpose of the entries (of the public hosts or network ranges) in the zone file is to introduce your caching server and then redirect any of the service queries (e.g. updates) of the other hosts to your caching server.\nRough example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your public host             ---update request-->                            Apple Update Server\n\n*Apple Update Server      ---reverse DNS look up--->                 auth. DNS server\n\n*Auth. DNS server            ---domain name/_aaplcache._tcp---> Apple Update Server\n\n*Apple Update Server      - determines the responsible caching server\n\n*Apple Update Server      ---sends public ip of caching server---> your public host\n\n*Your public host             ---update request-->                            your caching server\n\n\nA: In a nutshell, here's how I explain the caching server to clients:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each iOS and Mac device checks in with Apple's servers for some cloud activity like storing iCloud assets and downloading iCloud assets, App store downloads, software updates and downloads.\n\n*The server.app also checks in to Apple's servers and asks to cache content based on the settings.\n\n*Everything works well if you have an internal/non-routable IP address and a small network with the default settings\n\n*You need some DNS glue if your server is only/primarily reachable by a public IP address so that the iOS and Mac clients can know to contact the \"local\" caching server even though from a strict networking subnet sense, the server isn't actually \"local\" compared to the IP address of the requesting client.\n\n\nSome related threads which may or may not have good answers are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you tell if updates came from OS X caching server?\n\n*Is there a way to detect caching servers?\nEmpirically, you can use test devices to delete and reinstall apps on various subnets and tail the caching server log files to see that a request was seen by the caching server. Again, not all request empirically hit the caching server. I have two servers set up in my \"test\" environment and I see success rates of 60 to 80% most requests on most days. My thinking is that load issues, timeouts, lost packets and such account for the \"failures\" to utilize the caching server, but on the whole, I save gigabytes of traffic a day and sometimes far, far more traffic on update days and when clients use iCloud Photo Library - some times setting up a new device hits the cache server almost exclusively for a pleasant experience once the content is cached locally.\nYou'll probably want to dig in to the command line options, though if you run server.app on anything but a flat network segment.\n", "Q: Uninstalling freetds from OS X Mavericks Does anyone know how to uninstall freetds from OS X?\nI have installed it from source by following instructions:\ntar zxvf freetds-stable.tgz   \ncd freetds-'0.91'   \n./configure --prefix=/usr/local   \nmake  \nsudo make install \n\ngem install tiny_tds -- --with-freetds-include=/usr/local/include --with-freetds-lib=/usr/local/lib --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/include --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/lib\nMy question is, what are the steps to uninstall this software?\n\nA: I was able to successfully uninstall freetds and tiny_tds gem.\nfirst I uninstalled tiny_tds gem as below:\n gem uninstall tiny_tds\n\nTo uninstall freetds follow the instructions to configure and build the freetds before running make uninstall.(otherwise it will give this error: make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'.

My initial problem: I am using git with SSH for authentication. Each time I push/pull, I get The authenticity of the host […] can’t be established, and after confirming to trust the host, I can connect successfully, but the confirmation is not recorded: Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/Users/peterlefanulumsdaine/.ssh/known_hosts).\nThe cause appears to be restrictive permissions/access control lists (ACLs) of the file ~/.ssh/known_hosts, as described e.g. here.\npeterlefanulumsdaine$ ls -le ~/.ssh/\n[…]\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 peterlefanulumsdaine  staff  6795 18 Feb  2015 known_hosts\n0: group:everyone deny write,delete,append,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\n\nand the obvious solution, as suggested at that link, is to clear the ACLs with sudo chmod -N ~/.ssh/known_hosts.\nHowever, I am wary of changing permissions without knowing something about the reasons for the existing settings.  So: why are the default permissions/ACLs for ~/.ssh/known_hosts restrictive, and is it safe to make them less restrictive by clearing the ACLs?\n(I am on Yosemite, 10.10.5.  I haven’t ever tinkered with ~/.ssh/known_hosts by hand.  The only tools I directly use that I would guess might have affected it are ssh, git, and brew.)\n\nA: It's perfectly safe.

But he did not remove the MDM profile from the iPad.\nShe did the full reset on the iPad, however the MDM profile is still there how can I remove that or should I return the device?\n\nA: Open general, swipe up on the right side, find Profiles & Device Management and tap it.\nTap each of the profiles in turn and delete them. The MDM profile should show \"Remove Management\" in red and explain what it will do. The others should say \"Delete Profile\"\nWhen that's done, you should have a clean device that you could erase all content and settings. Then see that the device isn't tied to a corporate Device Enrollment system. In that case, you'd want to return the iPad or get a bill of sale indicating that the device will be released from \"corporate\" control in a period of time.\nThe DEP can be under education or business - so the steps they take will be similar to release that serial number and not re-enroll it in the MDM each time the device is configured/activated.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/business/dep/\n\nA: The device could be set up in DEP to the company it belonged to. In which case, they'd have to remove the DEP profile in their MDM. Even then, apple would still show that it belongs to them unless they contact apple and let them know that they sold it.\n\nA: If your iPad is locked with another users Apple ID there is no way to remove that profile yourself.

Does that final update mean I have the full regular install, or is it still a Beta? \n\nA: No - in general, the builds that are GM Candidates are marked as final and you need to go install the correct update intentionally.

Like @Hoshts and @Joonas have mentioned in their comments on another answer it's not free, but gorgeous and easy to understand. Money well spent, in my opinion, unless you're just looking for a one-time solution.\nOne thing to keep in mind - the Mac App Store version of Daisy Disk is sandboxed - which means only the files your user can read will be counted.\nIf you use the direct download version of the app (which will assume the license from the MAS version if you install both and run the direct version after launching the MAS version one time and quitting it.) - it can run as Administrator and show all the files for all users on your Mac.\n\nA: My favourite tool for this is http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/ which gives a great graphical representation of files.\nIn your particular case, I have encountered issues with smaller \"Solid State Drives\" like those used in earlier MacBook Air system, where the system does not completely free up filespace on the SSD when some things have been deleted - perhaps waiting for some background tasks to take care of it eventually. To give the process a kickstart so to speak, I have run /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app and used the \"Erase Free Space\" and that has freed up a lot of room that was not visibly being used when looking at any of the \"file space\" tools.\nThe older MacBookAir (2012 and before) machines can have the SSD upgraded to something bigger. See for example: http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Air-Retina\n\nA: Use the program called Disk Inventory X.

Seeing as it's 5+ years old, I really need a new one, reliability wise. It freezes when I'm working and has it's random shut-downs/white screens/black screens. (Link to specs)\nBut, I've got a dilemma. I'm a graphic designer and need to work with Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign, so performance is needed. BUT, I also am working on my masters degree, which requires portability, internet and MS Word (no more).   \nI don't take on too many design projects seeing as getting my masters degree takes up a lot of my time. But, I do need to work with big Photoshop files (2+GB) which my current granny-macbook can't handle properly anymore. (specifically CPU and GPU are busy chewing on the size documents I work regularly on)\nHow can I evaluate my workload to better decide if \nRetina 13\" with 3.1/3.4 dual-core Intel Core i7,\n16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, Intel Iris Graphics 6100  \nvs\nRetina 15\" 2.8/4.0 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD with\nIntel Iris Pro Graphics + AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2 GB vRAM\nWhat do you recommend? Is the 13\" performance OK to last roughly 2 years of heavy Photoshop use or do I need to get the bigger and thus less-portable 15\"? Is the 3,1GHz dual core 13\" as good as the 2,8GHz quad core 15\", or at least a lot better than the one I have now?\n\nA: Here's the way it goes in our household:\nI own the 15\" Model you describe above (albeit a slightly earlier version with the GTX750M GFX card) and my other half has the 13\" you describe above (again, albeit 6 months old at this point)\nNow, she does a lot of graphical work on it in Adobe CC - Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc - much the same as you want to. She says it never skips a beat for her, even when she's running it on external displays in the office and driving the graphics side of things hard. She sometimes gets frustrated with the lack of screen real estate compared to mine (when she does use it) but it's generally not a problem for her. The battery also performs a bit better, which helps if you're on the move a lot. Sure, a bit of extra power would help her but the portability and price trade offs aren't worth it.\nBased on what you've said, I'd recommend the 13\". It's plenty powerful for what you want, but I would use the left over cash to buy a couple of nice 24\" external displays if you have the space to set up a small office. I love having 3 displays running (1 on the MacBook + 2 external.) Better on so many levels!\nAnother note - it used to be possible to upgrade MacBooks (more RAM, swap out the HDD for an SSD, etc) so I used to recommend buying less and adding to it when you need it. Can't do that anymore, so buy as high spec as you can afford.\n\nA: Personally, the GPU is probably important for what you mention, so I'd consider something entirely different.\nYou wouldn't go wrong with the SSD storage in either machine and the CPU are both so fast, you won't be realistically waiting for either. I personally find no problem using the 12 inch MacBook Pro for heavy graphics, image processing, Xcode and such. Portability is more important for me and I didn't know about the iPad Pro when I bought it.\nI'd get the iPad Pro and not look back. If you decide you absolutely need a Mac too, spend the rest of your $$ on the 4k 21 inch iMac which has far more bang for the buck in terms of CPU/GPU than any portable and you're basically getting a free amazing screen. Even if you bump the RAM to 16 GB and spec SSD storage on that, it's the same cost as portables you mentioned.\nI've spent three separate 30 minute sessions with the Pro iPad and the keyboard and everything about it is far superior to my MacBook 2015 and I choose that over either the MacBook Pro you have recommended. It's smaller, faster for what I do and less cost. I have access to a 27 inch iMac retina for some graphics work, but mostly just use the MacBook connected to a nice display. I'm selling my other iPads and will be getting an iPad Pro since drawing on it is superior to anything anywhere I've seen. No cintiq, tablet, mouse can hold a candle to the Apple Pencil and the software on it for drawing is going to be so good so fast, my feeling is almost everyone will feel hamstring on Photoshop and Illustrator on the Mac in a few months time.\nIf you're not game for that, my opinion would be the 13 inch is more than enough for the task unless your billable rate is such that you can recover the investment in made up time or you really need the screen size to take with you.\n", "Q: Can't boot after El Capitan Installation Partly installed El Capitan on my Mac Book Air and was unable to finish the installation due to time. Now when I go to log into my computer the home screen with my personal icon is white, and when I put in my password the screen fills with code.(black bars with white writing) Then an Apple Page comes up saying my computed wont start because of an error. That it needs to be restarted. Every time I restart it or shut it down the same thing happens. \nHow can I fix it please? \n\nA: Shut down your computer. Press the power button and before you hear the boot chime hold down the Command (Apple) key and R at the same time.\nThis will boot you into Recovery Mode. You should then be able to connect to your network and reinstall the operating system.\n", "Q: Run multiple instances of El Capitan on a single Apple laptop? Is it possible to simultaneously run two instances of El Capitan on a single Apple laptop? \nAssume that I'm willing to purchase the best MacBook available as of November 2015, with the largest capacity SSD drive and maxed out memory.\nThere are a few pre-existing questions on this topic but most of them discuss situations where the user is trying to (a) run a parallel Windows installation or (b) have an alternate OS installation that's selectable on a separate volume at boot-time, but isn't running concurrently with the first OS installation.\nIdeally, in the configuration I'm describing, the two OS installations will:\n\n\n*\n\n*run simultaneously,\n\n*see each other on the \"network,\" presumably via some sort of local loop or other internal mechanism,\n\n*share a common ethernet adapter, keyboard, mouse, video output, sound card, etc.\n\n*allow for some kind of shortcut key to easily \"flip\" back and forth between the two running installations,\n\n*allow for a dual-monitor setup.. meaning when viewing OS-installation-1, both monitors will be dedicated to that installation as is typical in a dual monitor setup. When I flip to OS-installation-2, both monitors are then dedicated to that installation. I'm not counting the built-in laptop display as a monitor. I'm talking about two external Thunderbolt monitors.\n\n\nIf this scenario is feasible but you feel that no current Apple MacBook has the specs to support it, could it be accomplished using the (new) Mac Pro?\nWould I be better off waiting for Apple to release a laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3 in order to drive two monitors? If so, will said laptops be available next year?\nSorry for the naive nature of this question. Any advice appreciated.\n\nA: Virtual Machine\nA virtual machine is a software app that emulates a complete computer. \nFile System\nThe VM opens one big file in the host, and stores an entire file system inside. That file system includes an OS to boot such as BSD, Linux, MS Windows, or Mac OS X. Apple’s license permit Mac OS X to be run in a VM only when hosted on a real (physical) Mac. \nEasy Backups\nOne benefit of having an entire guest file system stored in a single file on the host OS is easy backups. Attach an external hard drive and copy over the single (but large) VM file to capture a snapshot. Note that you should exclude these VM files from your Time Machine as their size will overwhelm your Time Machine storage. To exclude them, use the Privacy tab in the Time Machine pane of System Preferences. Also, your VM app may offer a setting to exclude from Time Machine.\nEntire Desktop Within a Window\nThe VM runs in a window like any other app on the host computer. Inside that window will be an entire other Mac desktop. You may find it less confusing to run the VM in full-screen mode, so the virtual desktop takes over the entire screen thereby appearing to be a second Mac. See the System Preferences panes for mouse, trackpad, and Mission Control gestures for switching between full-screen apps.\nI regularly work this way as a software developer. Each development project lives in its own virtual machine. This works so well that I set the virtual Mac Dock to right side of the screen while the real Mac Dock is on the left, so I can differentiate as a reminder while I work. \nVM Products\nThe main VM products available for Mac hosts are :\n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels\n\n*Fusion by VMware\n\n*VirtualBox by Oracle\n\n\nSee these comparisons. \nAll three are solid products, actively maintained and improved. All work surprisingly well on a Mac. All run various operating systems as guest OSes including BSD, Linux, and many more.\nThe first two directly support installing Mac OS X as a guest OS. Just point them to Apple’s installer app for any of the more recent versions of Mac OS X going back at least to Mountain Lion. VirtualBox is not so simple, apparently requiring some tricks to install Mac OS X as a guest.\nThe first two listed products have put much work into features to integrate the guest OS with the host OS. I find those features unnecessary and even counter-productive. Fortunately you can disable much of that integration.\nNetworks\nThe network can be shared with the host computer, using same IP address. Or VM can present its own IP to the network, appearing as a second computer. Thirdly, the VM can be isolated from the external network. Your choice.\nLimitations\nVMs work surprisingly well overall. Every version of every VM tool I have used always has some some glitch or another, but never a show-stopper.\nOne major limitation is a lack of support for hardware-accelerated graphics. So playing videos and games performs poorly. Overall usage can seem sluggish as menus and windows do not draw as quickly. I have verified this is true for all three listed products when running Mac OS X as a guest OS, as of 2015-10.\nI do not know about the support of multiple monitors. I have used Parallels versions 8, 9, 10, and 11 successfully with multiple monitors on the host Mac, but the virtual machine knew only of one monitor at a time. \nRequires Much Memory\nI use a MacBook Retina 15\" laptop with either an HDMI monitor or a DisplayPort monitor. I have 16 gigs of memory installed. The VMs do require much memory, and may not work well on Macs with two or four gigs.\nRequires Storage Space\nEach VM file can be large, usually starting at a few gigs and rising to several tens of gigs. Plan accordingly. Each product listed has a feature to reclaim empty space that may accumulate within its' VM file.\n", "Q: hdiutil convert not working and not telling me why I've been trying to create a bootable Ubuntu flash drive following instructions from multiple sites. I need to convert the .iso file to an .img using hdiutil. For starters, the syntax of the command is very unclear. The ubuntu site and the -help option of hdiutil say hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso but the man hdiutil says hdiutil convert ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img. I have tried both ways and neither has worked. I don't get any sort of error message, and I know my paths are correct (when I try with an incorrect path it says so).

I know that I can do something where the monitors are mirrored, or the monitors are virtually \"side by side.\"\nCan I have my MacBook Pro on one \"Desktop 1\" (like the desktops you press F3 to see) and my monitor on Desktop 2? That way, I would be able to do the three finger mouse swipe to change between screens. Is that possible in the current Mac OS?\nIs this possible?\n\nA: There is: System preferences > Mission control > [x] Displays have separate spaces\n\nA: I do not think there is a way to get the two screens to display two different \"desktops\" as you describe them. \nHowever, do you not have effectively the same thing when you arrange the two screens \"side-by-side\" (or top-and-bottom, or whatever geometry you set in the \"System Preferences\" -> \"Displays\" -> \"Arrangement\" control)? Using one finger to move the mouse from one display to the othe brings along a dock and a menu bar, no? What more could you want?\n"]
