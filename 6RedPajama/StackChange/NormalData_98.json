["Q: LoCo activity/course of action proposal on Ubuntu Wiki I would like to publish an plan of action for an activity or event for the LoCo on Ubuntu Wiki. Is there any convention or format I can refer to?\nI do not know how to create and chart a proper activity blueprint, hence I would like pointers on how to get started, what relevant information to add, etc.\n\nA: There's really not a formula for this.\nSome Local Teams have a scratch space where people can add projects. Here's what ours from Michigan looks like: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MichiganTeam/Projects\nYou can just add a section to your LocoTeam pages on the wiki, or you can just add a subpage to your namespace if you want to work on it before moving it on there. For example http://wiki.ubuntu.com/JorgeCastro/MyGreatIdea and then propose it to your local team list.\nYou're not too specific on what kind of activity you want to run, but you can check out these pages for examples on how to run events, it's a collection from all sorts of Local Teams on how they do things:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamKnowledgeBase\nIf you can't find information there, the Local Team leaders are on this mailing list if you want to ask questions about doing something specifically, chances are someone has already done it and made all the mistakes and learned from it. There are many experienced leaders on this list so if you want to run an event and are looking for someone to check it our for you that's where I'd go next.\n", "Q: How do I configure a mouse thumb button? How can I configure the mouse thumb button. For example, if I want it to act as a double click.\nMy mouse is Microsoft Notebook Mouse 5000 Bluetooth (if it matters) and I use Natty.\nThanks.\n\nA: By installing a couple packages you can configure this pretty easily without too much trouble at all.  No matter what version of Linux I'm using i am always sure to install two specific applications when it comes to mouse and keyboard emulation.\nThese being:\nxautomation is a set of command line programs to control X and do \"visual scraping\" to find things on the screen.  There are six different programs to this application but the one we are gonna be concerning ourself with is xte.  This program allows us to send arbitrary mouse and keyboard events to the kernel by utilizing the \"XTest\" extension.\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\nxbindkeys is a program that enables us to bind commands to certain keys or key combinations on the keyboard and is window manager independent, so whether you are in Gnome, Unity, KDE, etc... it makes no difference.\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n****By using these two programs together we can make the keyboard and mouse do just about anything we want them to.***\nYou say you want to use the thumb button in your case for instance, well first we need to find what \"mouse button number\" X Server is recognizing when you click it. We will use a useful tool called xev to run this program do the following:\n1. Open up a terminal window and type the following command at the prompt\nxev\nIt will open an event handler on your screen that looks like the following:\n\nThe xev application, showing keycodes\nXev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved, resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.). You can also attach it to an existing window. It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to display the information that they contain; it is essentially a debugging and development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.\nHover your mouse over the event window that opened on your screen and click your thumb button.  You will see alot of things happening in your terminal window but the one thing that we are concerned with is the \"button number\" of the one you just clicked.  This can be found at the bottom of your terminal window and should look something similar to the following line:\nstate 0x10, button 1, same_screen YES\nThe button part is what were interested in.  Being yours is a thumb button its probably gonna say button 8 or button 9 but it could be any number.  Remember or write down that number for we will use it later.  You can now close xev we no longer need this program.\nNow to get things working!!\nAssuming you have installed the xautomation and xbindkeys applications as stated above, we will go ahead and do the following:\n2. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file inside your home directory called .xbindkeysrc this is the configuration file that xbindkeys is going to use to make your mouse or keyboard do the special things we'd like it to do.\n3. Type the following inside the file:\n\"xte 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1'\"\nb:X + Release\nNote:  **Be sure to replace X with whatever number you wrote down for your thumb button from when we ran xev earlier*.\nNote:  **There should also be no spaces between the first line and the second line.  If you have a space you will get an error when you run xbindkeys.*\nWhats were telling xbindkeys to do here is to take the action of clicking and releasing your thumb button and make it do the action of double clicking your left mouse button which is represented but 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1'\n \n4. Save the file and we should be good to go.\nOk lets test it out!!\n5. Open a terminal window and type the following so we can test the functionality:\nxbindkeys -n -v\nThis will run the xbindkeys program in debug mode so that we can see whats happening when you click on your button.  It will tell you that its reading the .xbindkeysrc file that we created and using it for its configuration.  If all goes well then you should end up with a line saying Starting Loop \nNow if you click on your thumb button on your mouse then you should see some things happening in your terminal, meaning that it's recognizing the button press.  You should now be getting the same functionality as you would by double-clicking with the left button of your mouse.\nYou should be able to test this out by using the thumb button and clicking on the menu bar of the terminal, which should maximize or minimize it, thus doing the same thing as a double click would do with the left mouse button.\nNow <Ctrl +C> and exit the program.\nNote: In order for this all to work all the time, we need to have xbindkeys running in the background at all times. If you just add a new command xbindkeys without the -n -v in your startup applications then it will start everytime you log in to your window manager.\nI've tried to explain in the best detail on how to go about doing this, hopefully you have been able to understand and complete this action with success. :)\n\nA: The official Ubuntu forums have a page on this - and to configure up to 7 mouse buttons you don't need any extra software.\nFrom that page, use the command:\n\nxinput set-button-map  1\n  2 3 6 7, replacing those numbers with\n  your required button mapping\n\n", "Q: Is there a pywinauto equivalent to automate the GUI from Python? pywinauto is a set of python modules to automate the Microsoft Windows GUI. At it’s simplest it allows you to send mouse and keyboard actions to windows dialogs and controls.\nIs there a linux equivalent of this python module?\nthanks!\n\nA: The linux desktop testing project (ldtp) should offer what you need. With the python-ldtp  package, you can write scripts in python. The project uses the accessibility methods to perform actions, so the application in question has to be a “standard” GTK/QT/… application and you need to enable accessibility (“Assistive technologies”).\nsudo apt-get install python-ldtp\n\nThe following python script would click the “New” button in an (already existing) gedit window and enter the string foo:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom ldtp import *\nfrom ldtputils import *\nclick('*-gedit', 'btnNew') \ngeneratekeyevent('foo')\n\n\nA: You can use Sikuli (now named SikuliX)\nURL: www.sikuli.org\nAccording to the website:\n\nSikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop\ncomputer running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image\nrecognition powered by OpenCV to identify and control GUI components.\nThis is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's\ninternals or the source code of the application or web page you want\nto act on.\nSikuliX supports as scripting languages:\n\n*\n\n*Python language level 2.7 (supported by Jython)\n\n*Ruby language level 1.9 and 2.0 (supported by JRuby)\n\n… and you can use it in Java programming and\nprogramming/scripting with any Java aware programming/scripting\nlanguage (Jython, JRuby, Scala, Clojure, …).\nThough SikuliX is currently not available on any mobile device, it can\nbe used with the respective emulators on a desktop computer or based\non VNC solutions.\n\nPlease bare in mind that it's in beta.\n", "Q: DNS server not responding From time to times I have to reboot my Ubuntu 11.04 remote desktop. Once it up and I run Cromium browser with many tabs (20 for example) dns server doesn't respond anymore.

I installed Apache on an Ubuntu VM. When I go into the guest and load up Firefox I can see that Apache is working fine when I browse to localhost.\nI would like to access this same page through the host. I've tried using the IP address of the guest but nothing comes up. Ideally I would love to set up my Windows 7 (host) to request http://guestserver.com of the Apache server on the guest. How can I do this?\n\nA: The accepted answer did not work for me (I installed virutalbox inside ubuntu 12.04 LTSand inside virtualbox I installed ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server). I just swapped the network settings for Adapter1 and Adapter2 i.e. setting up Adapter1 for \"bridged networing\" and Adapter2 for \"NAT\" and it started working.\n\nA: If you cant connect over ip you're not likely to have any success with dns names on a default apache install.\ncheck the network settings of the virtual host, I always putt it to bridged to it can be accessed throughout the entire network.\n\nA: If you only need a specific port (Say if you are running a web application like Jetty or Tomcat) just do:\nSettings -> Network -> Set one of the adapters as NAT -> Press 'Port forwarding' -> Set the relevant host and guest port.\nOnce you save, You could just go from your local machine to localhost:hostport and it'll be redirect to the virtual box relevant port and you are done.\n\nA: In bridged mode, if your host uses a static IP address, you should manually config your guest IP in the same range with the host IP. Otherwise, the guest will not be automatically allocated with a valid IP address. HTH. \n\nA: Lekensteyn's answer is right.  But if you are in a corporate environment, you might have to disable the proxy server for your guest's IP address.  For example, if you are using Mozilla Firefox on your Host machine and you are trying to access 192.168.56.101/ on the guest, you need to go to Firefox's Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings and use \"No Proxy\" or \"No Proxy For ->  192.168.56.101\".  \n\nA: If you need to access a guest which gets different IP due to use of DHCP, I suggest accessing via it's hostname. However accessing via hostname when the host is Windows might require an extra tool.\nThe following text was copied from my own answer at superuser.com.:\nI suggest you use Multicast DNS to fix this. \nUbuntu is using this by default via Avahi.\nThe Windows host needs an Avahi-client for it to discover other Avahi-services. If your host already uses some Apple software this is probably already there via a service called Bonjour. However, if this is not already installed then a small version of Bonjour is available for download here: Bonjour Print Services. After installation you should be able to access your guest via .local. \nNote: The mDNS system seem to use the .local postfix by default. So, if your hostname is \"dev.myapp.com\", then the actual hostname will be \"dev.myapp.com.local\". \n\nA: If you need other machines in your physical network to be able to reach your VM (or if the VM needs Internet access), use bridged networking. Otherwise, stick to host-only networking.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop your VM and open its settings in the VirtualBox (OSE) Manager\n\n*Go to the Network tab\n\n*Select the network mode at your choice (bridged networking or host-only) (in the below example, I'm using host-only)\nIf you want to use bridged networking, you've to select the right network adapter at Name. For wired connections, you'd select something named like eth0. Wireless connections are usually named wlan0 (the numbers may vary)\n\n*Save the settings\n\n*Start the Ubuntu VM\n\n*When up, you can gather the IP address by running:\nifconfig | grep addr\n\nIn the below output, 192.168.56.101 is the IP address that can be used in your Win7 host system to access your VM:\neth0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:70:27:fe  \n      inet addr:192.168.56.101  Bcast:192.168.56.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n      inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe7b:25fe/64 Scope:Link\n      inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n      inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n\n\n*In your windows host system, edit C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts as administrator and add a line:\n192.168.56.101   guestserver.com\n\nIf you've a Ubuntu host system, edit /etc/hosts using sudo nano /etc/hosts\n\n*Profit!\n\n\nA: In my case, I have a router assigning a static IP to my Host PC.\n\n*\n\n*Set the network adapter as Bridge:\nSettings > Network > Adapter 1 (Enable Network Adapter) > Attached to: (Bridge Adapter) > OK\n\n\n*Start the Virtual Machine > log in\n\n\n*Change the VirtualMachine's IP from dynamic to static\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n*Under The primary network interface change the word dhcp to static\nand enter your new static IP or comment the line and add a new one\n:\n#iface eth0 inet dhcp\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.10.110\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 192.168.10.1\n        network 192.168.10.0\n        broadcast 192.168.10.255\n\nNotice my router is working at\nxxx.xxx.10.x\nand yours could be at\nxxx.xxx.0.x\nor\nxxx.xxx.1.x\nor some else.\nAfter you do that, you can have internet conection in both host and guest machine, and type that static IP in your web browser to check you apache server.\n\nA: Instead of trying to set the adapters to Bridged or Host Only Network Adapter, you can try Port forwarding under Firewall/ Other ports, with your port no set to tcp and udp connections.\n\nA: i solved the same problem after search a lot and read a lot of message in the next form: \n1) Mount a Virtual Machine in Virtual Box 6.1 with an empty versión of Ubuntu Server 16.04, 2GB RAM and one CPU.

If it exsists, Nautilus choose the alternative /media/$label_ . Then the mount point is removed when you unmount.\nThe fact that you have both is due probably to a /media/$label not removed for some reasons.

I've been a Ubuntu user for long, but, because of the lack of software updates (Eclips since in 3.5, and others), and because Ubuntu (in my point of view) is becoming more and more resources hungry (for my little netbook :S), I've switched (before 11.04 was released) into Arch Linux and I'm very very happy with it.\nBut, since 11.04 is out, and I've tested Unity I have to say that I love it so much !

I was wondering what is the default saving directory for Accessories > Take Screenshot?\nI just took a screenshot and I am looking for where it is saved. \n\nA: It should be the desktop directory: ~/Desktop.\nYou can change it before pressing \"Save\" button.\n\nA: On my keyboard, Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia Keyboard, if I use the right Shift key along with the Print key, I am able to select screenshot area and save the image to a location. \nIf I use the left Shift key along with Print key, i am able to select print area but it copies the image to the clipboard.  Side note, I don't believe Left Shift+Ctrl+ Print does anything different than Left Shift+Print, both give you a cross hair and copy to clipboard.  \n\nA: After you took your screenshot (e.g. by pressing Print or selecting Take Screenshot from the applications menu/Dash) you have a selection of  where you want to save the image. You can either Copy to Clipboard or yo ucan save it to a specified directory. By clicking on the dropdown menu next to Save in folder: you can change the save directory easily:\n\nBy selecting Other... we may enter any directory of our choice. This selection will be remembered for the next time (saved in gconf: /apps/gnome-screenshot/last_save_directory).\n\nA: For 18.04: ~/Pictures\nFrom: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux\n\nscreenshot is a default application for taking screenshots on Gnome\ndesktop. To take screenshot simply hit PrtSc button on your keyboard\nand the screenshot of your entire desktop will be taken and saved as\n*.png file inside your ~/Pictures directory.\n\n\nA: Screenshots are not saved automatically; you have to save them yourself. The default screenshot directory is either the desktop or the home folder, and is named Screenshot#.png\n\nA: 11.04 and up\nYou can take screenshots simply by pressing the PrtScr key. A window will pop-up asking for the name and directory to save the screenshot to or if you wish to copy it to the clipboard.\n\nYou can also narrow your screenshot to just the active window by using Ctrl-PrtScr instead.\n\nA: By default Ubuntu keeps screenshot at the pictures folder. Anyways it provides option to change the destination as per user. Please visit the Pictures folder\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04 Just press PrtSc.\nI was using Ctrl + Print, OR Fn + Print, it was taking the screenshot in the clipboard but wasn't storing the screenshot in the /home/{user}/Pictures directory.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04+:\nI want to add that:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + PrtSc (PrintScreen) will take a screenshot and copy it to the clipboard. It does NOT save the image anywhere on your file system. Paste the screenshot into another program, such as LibreOffice Writer, with Ctrl + V.\n\n*Just PrtSc will take a screenshot and save it on your file system inside the ~/Pictures directory in the format Screenshot from YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.png. Ex: ~/Pictures/Screenshot from 2022-01-29 09-03-13.png.\n\n*\n\n*Note: depending on your keyboard, you may have to use the Fn key or other keys as well to activate the PrtSc key.\n\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*PrtSc – Captures a Screenshot of the entire screen as it is. This is then saved to the ‘Pictures’ directory.\n\n*Shift + PrtSc – Captures a screenshot of a specific region that you select. This is also saved to the ‘Pictures’ directory.\n\n*Alt + PrtSc – Captures a screenshot of the current window you are working on.

I was under the impression it runs when I login. How can I get it to do so?\n\nA: .bashrc (as it name may suggest) is only executed on startup of a bash shell.\nYou have to edit ~/.profile to apply changes to your graphical session. Note that this file is intended for setting environment variables and such.

It will pop up with your clipboard contents and settings menu and doesn't need the panel at all, though it does have a panel icon.\n\nA: Keepboard is another one that offers such features. \n", "Q: Is Banshee damaging my music files? I don't know whether that's true, but sometime from now (maybe since I've started using ubuntu 11.04), my music files have started showing errors on the execution. Basically, many .mp3 files I had are damaged and start the music twice, like: the music starts then 2 seconds later it restarts and continues playing. This errors appear when listening to the songs in any players, being from ubuntu, windows or iPod. Is it possible that Banshee is doing this?\n\nA: Banshee should not be damaging your files as it should be merely reading them. Unless there is something (extremely) wrong with how the metadata is being written back into the mp3 files.\nGo to Edit >> Preferences and see if the record metadata to files box is checked. If it is, try disabling it. If it is disabled, than it is unlikely Banshee is causing it.\nYou mention starting to use ubuntu 11.04 - did you do a clean install or a direct upgrade? An upgrade could represent an issue with audio drivers. I'm baffled because you mention trying it in ubuntu, windows and the iPod.\nHave you done any sort of re-enconding/conversion of the files?\nWhat you can do to test is first testing an album in windows and then trying in ubuntu (and vice-versa).\nThere are so many factors in to question that I ultimately think you are better off filing a bug report over Banshees launchpad. \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/banshee\n", "Q: What is the least insecure way to store a password that is used by a script? I have a Bash script that automatically authenticates with a service using my username and password. The credentials are currently stored as plain text within the script.\nWhat precautions should I take to most securely store these credentials while still allowing the script access?\nPoints of clarification:\n\n\n*\n\n*I understand that, if available, other methods of authentication should be used instead. I still want to know what to do in the case that password authentication is the only option.\n\n*Not storing the password at all is not an acceptable answer here. I am asking about the case in which the script must have unattended access to the password.\n\n\nA: What kind of service? Certain services have other methods to authenticate, e.g. SSH keys for SSH in conjunction with SSH agent.\nI'd store the password separate from the script, and make sure that all path components have the correct permissions set. E.g., make sure that in the path /path/to/file, /, /path and /path/to are owned by a user you trust (root) and that these are not writable by someone who is not allowed to see your files. Finally, the recommended permissions for file is 600 or 400.\nThat file could look like this:\nPASSWORD='something that you cannot remember'\n\nIn your script, use the below code to import the variable:\n. /path/to/file\n\nAs for your script, make sure that it does not contain holes which may allow attackers to execute code in the script context (e.g. uncontrolled environment which may have an arbitrary $PATH variable set or invalid use of other files (e.g. sourcing a world-writable file).\nAs for the actual protection of your password, you can't. It must be available somehow to the other service. As an alternative, you can encrypt the file/ script containing the password using openssl or gpg so you need to enter a password before the credentials are unlocked. This is especially useful if your service's password is hard to remember.\n\nA: Instead of hardcoding the password in the file, store the password in a separate file and protect the file (chmod 700 or chmod 500) so that only the authorised users can access it.\nRetrieve the password with cat /dir/to/file/with/.password instead of reading the file and storing the content of it into a variable.\n\nA: I know this is an old question but i faced this similar issue and i used Ubuntu's key ring to solve it.\nHere is a solution on ubuntu 18.04LTS\nOpen the terminal\nWrite down keyring set {{service}} {{username}}\nfor example if you are using this for school password logging:\nkeyring set school mohamed\n\nIt will log you for a password enter the password. Now the password you entered is stored in Ubuntu keyring.\nTo get this password write in the terminal:\nkeyring get school mohamed\n\nto use this in the context of an script:\npassword=$(keyring get school mohamed)\n\nNow the password contatins the password you previously entered.\n", "Q: External display is showing and reporting wrong resolutions I'm running 11.04 in dual-boot on my macbook pro (2010).

I'm trying to open a psd file with layers, but it gets rendered all wrong. Several colors and gradients show up as black in GIMP instead. If I open the psd in IrfanView with Wine, it will render correctly, but I won't have access to layers.\nIs there something I can do to have the psd file with layers render properly in GIMP? If not, is there some other program I can try to view the layers of a psd file?\n\nA: Since you don't seem to be a programmer, you can't really do anything.\nGIMP can't render all PSD files properly simply because it doesn't have some feature. E.g. in Photoshop gradients are often applied as layer styles, and GIMP doesn't have them.\nThere is support for PSD coming to Krita, another image editing application, but I really couldn't say how much it will support.\n\nA: Sounds like it might be either:\na. A bug in Gimp.\nb. A video driver issue.\nIf it is a bug in gimp, you can try updating it. Maybe the Gimp-Painter fork won't have the issue. I copied the following code from David Revoys blog.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mizuno-as/ppa && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp gimp-plugin-registry\n\nOr maybe... try this: run the windows version of Gimp on Wine and see if you get the correct layers and render. If you do, then there is probably something askew with the video drivers and how Gimp is using them. You can always try converting it to a different format, maybe it is something wrong with the file.\nYou can also try to re-install your video drivers (I recommend using synaptic, just mark them for re-installation). Maybe even re-install Gimp. Reboot and then try opening it again.\nI hope one of these helps you. :)\n\nA: Just an explanation why the file opens in IrfanView: when Photoshop saves a PSD file, it embeds a merged full-size \"preview\" image in it - this is what is displayed by viewers. Obviously, they don't have access to layers in the file. Gimp need to render the whole stack, which is much more difficult.\nIn principle, the merged preview generation can be turned off in Photoshop, which will make PSD smaller, but all viewers will see just black then.\nIn my experience, Gimp has no problems rendering \"classic\" Photoshop's... err... pixel-based layers. However, recent versions of Photoshop introduced \"vector\" or \"procedural\" (I don't remember the exact term used) layers - i.e. instead of actual pixel data, Photoshop stores definitions of geometric figures, gradients and stuff, which can be edited without loss of quality. Those layers are problematic for Gimp. I think they can be rasterized in Photoshop before saving which will make Gimp to open the file correctly.  \n\nA: There are quite a few good alternatives to Photoshop: http://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-photoshop/?exactmatch=true\nI've used Pinta before and I think it rendered PSD files pretty well.\nEdit: My mistake, Pinta doesn't seem to be able to open PSD files at all.\n", "Q: How do I extract a RPM file?

Alternatively you can use the command:\n$ sudo apt-get install rpm2cpio\n$ rpm2cpio /path/to/file.rpm | cpio -i --make-directories\n\nthat will extract the rpm content to the current directory.\n\nA: As far as I remember you have to use a app called alien which transforms .rpm to deb files. Use a terminal to do :\nsudo apt-get install alien\n\nthen \nsudo alien -d nameofyourpackage.rpm (-d for Debian package)\n\nIf you then need to examine it you can resort to your dpkg -x file.deb method\n\nA: You can also use alien to only extract the files (which it calls \"generate a build tree\")\nalien --scripts --generate <package.rpm>\nYou will get 2 dirs - <package>, and <package>.orig, which is the raw extraction from the rpm.\n", "Q: Disable compression for ReplayGain in Banshee In Rhythmbox it's possible to disable compression for ReplayGain by unchecking a box in the settings of its ReplayGain plugin. The option is described like the following:\n\nIt provides configuration options for\n  [...] enabling or disabling\n  compression in order to prevent\n  clipping.\n\nI wonder if there is such an option in Banshee? I have checked in its menu and glanced under Banshee in the dconf-editor without finding anything.\nThe reason I'm asking is after reading the following in the ReplayGain specification:\n\nThe audiophile user will not want any\n  compression or limiting on the signal.\n  In this case the only option is to\n  automatically and temporarily reduce\n  the pre-amp gain below the\n  user-selected setting for tracks where\n  clipping would otherwise occur.\n\n\nA: Banshee currently does neither; it doesn't handle clipping at all, merely applying the needed gain.  This is somewhat less important given that it also doesn't expose the pre-amp knob so it's much less likely that the audio will clip in the first place.\nSo, the answer to the question “How do I disable compression for ReplayGain in Banshee” is: you do nothing; there is no compression for ReplayGain in Banshee ☺.\nBanshee's ReplayGain support is largely influenced by what I care about and think makes sense from a UI perspective.  There are a bunch of knobs that could potentially be exposed, but I don't think make a huge amount of sense, or should be automatic (selection of album versus track gain, for example).\nClipping prevention is something that probably should be implemented, though.  At some point ☺.\n", "Q: Wireless keeps cutting out every several minutes on a Realtek RTL8187SE The internet keeps cutting out every several minutes, sometimes it lasts longer but it happens eventually.

In your area, there may be too much traffic on the channel you selected.\nOnce you've ruled these areas out, five software possible avenues you could consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Looking to see if any WiFi Backport exist and if so, installing the appropriate package\n\n*See if this is a 64bit vs 32bit issue\n\n*Trying a newer Kernel, either the next available stable kernel OR testing the very latest alpha/beta Ubuntu version which contains the latest release candidate kernel\n\n*Disabling the power management of your wireless card\n\n*(the choice of very last resort) using NDISWrapper\n\n\nBackports\nThe kernel developers often release a software package containing updates for WiFi devices derived from the latest or most recent kernel.\nFor Natty, this package is called linux-backports-modules-cw-2.6.39-generic (thanks Jorge).  This package can be found either in the proposed repository or in the backport repository.  Tick the appropriate checkbox in Software Sources and Reload the latest updates.\nOpen either Software Center or Synaptic Manager and search for the package named (or similarly named) as above.  If the package is available, install the package, reboot and see if the WiFi connection is more stable.\n64bit vs 32bit\nAs linux matures, 64bit vs 32bits issues should reduce.  However it is not unknown that a 64bit installation can be more unstable compared to a 32bit installation - and visa-versa.\nFor your card, I found a bug report for your Wireless card here that describes your symptoms - 64bit kernel, wifi drops connection randomly.\nTake a backup of your system first using, for example, Clonezilla, so that you have something you can easily restore from.\nTry installing the 32bit version of Natty.  See if your connection is more stable.  You could also test the other suggestions in this answer in this 32bit configuration.\nNewer Kernel\nTesting a newer Kernel can sometimes cause instability issues - for example boot and black-screen issues.  I would recommend you remove any Additional Hardware graphic drivers (e.g. ATI or Nvidia) first.  I also recommend that you have a good backup for example, using CloneZilla which you can restore from.\nLook for the next stable mainline kernel from here on LaunchPad.\nLooking at the change lists on kernel 2.6.39, it does mention some updates for your card.\nYou can install the 2.6.39 kernel as described in my answer here.\nDisabling Power Management\nSometimes wireless cards can have Power Management modes.  Its not unknown for these modes to be buggy in linux.  Switching off power-management can sometimes help.\nYou may have to do some Google research to see if there is a specific method to disable Power Managment.  Below is a method I've used in the past for some cards.\nFrom a terminal type:\ngksu gedit /etc/pm/power.d/wireless\n\nIf the file opened contains any statements then add the following line (if it doesnt already exist)\n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nIf the file opened is empty then add the following\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nNow copy and paste the following:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/wireless\n\nThen reboot.\nsource\nNDISWrapper\nNote - NDISWrapper can cause black-screen issues on boot - so have a good backup for example, using CloneZilla which you can restore from.\nNDISWrapper was at one time a few years ago, one frequently used method for wireless cards because the kernel had so few wireless driver support.\nIts fallen out of favour in recent times for many reasons that I wont go into...\nTo be honest, RTL8187se has been in the kernel for some time so the following suggestion should be considered as a last resort.\nSearch for ndisgtk in the software center and install\nNow download the windows xp drivers, in your case from Realtek\nExtract from the zip file.\nUsing ndisgtk - navigate to the folder - RTL8187SE - WinXP and point ndisgtk to the .inf file.  Hopefully now (maybe after a reboot) network manager should use this driver in preference to the RTL8187SE kernel driver - n.b.  hopefully you dont have to blacklist the kernel.\n\nA: It sounds similar to an issue as I used to get in Meego (no not Ubuntu) where the wifi used to cut in and out so much so it was a real pain. \nI remember at the time that it was fixed by editing the rc.local file with a really easy fix which worked (albeit in Meego) but \ncd /etc/\n\ngksudo  gedit rc.local\nInsert the following lines if they are not already there (or uncomment them)\nifconfig wlan0 down\nifconfig wlan0 up\n\n(originally in the older meego bug we used to have to change wlan0 to eth1 (dont know why but it used to mean us using eth1 not wlan0 )\nold meego bug\nBUT this was a broadcom issue however it seemed a little similar to what you were describing\n", "Q: What is apt-fast and should I use it? Several times over the past couple years, I've heard of people using apt-fast for updating and installing packages, but I'm not really sure what it does.  I think I've traced its origin to this forum post, and it seems to be a script that speeds up apt-get operations.\nWhat exactly does the script do? Are there any potential downsides to using it? If not, why isn't everyone using it?\n\nA: It appears to use the program axel to download the files using multiple concurrent connections to multiple mirrors.  My guess is that everyone isn't using it because most people don't have connections that are significantly faster than the mirrors, and therefore, can substantially benefit from concurrent downloads, combined with the fact that most people haven't heard of it.  This is the first time I've ever heard it mentioned in 5 years of running Ubuntu.\n\nA: apt-fast is a shell script wrapper for apt-get and aptitude that can drastically improve APT download times by downloading packages with multiple connections per package. Apt-Fast uses the Axel download accelerator in Ubuntu 12.04 or the aria2 download accelerator in Ubuntu 14.04 and later to download different pieces of a package simultaneously, reducing the total time it takes to download a package.\nThe apt-fast package can be installed in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu by adding the apt-fast/stable PPA to your software sources and installing it using these commands.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable \nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install apt-fast  \n\nDuring the apt-fast installation process, you will be prompted to perform some package configuration.

I'm not really concerned about programming language in this case - although C, Python, or PHP would be preferred.\n\nA: Interesting question.  There is no official API for discovering if the messaging menu has changed it's state.  You can do it by looking at the DBus interface of the indicator-messages-service.  A shell script way is like this:\n  $ gdbus call --session --dest com.canonical.indicator.messages --object-path /com/canonical/indicator/messages/service --method com.canonical.indicator.messages.service.AttentionRequested\n\nThere is also a signal \"AttentionChanged\".  You can track that to determine the state as it updates.\nAlso, if you're interested in the individual items in the messaging menu all their information is exported using libindicate.

I have an PostScript output from a man page produced by man -t ssh > man_ssh.ps. It opens for viewing in Evince Document Viewer. I want to print it on a printer that supports double-sided printing. So, I'd like to print it in 'brochure' mode - that is, when four pages of a document are printed on two sides single sheet, so when the sheets are folded in half all at once, the numeration of the pages of a document is like in a booklet. How can I print the document this way in Evince? \nUPD: There is one more question, how to make man -t output comply to booklet page layout - that is, wider inner margins, making pages 'left' and 'right'?\n\nA: I have found a way to configure CUPS so that it calls pdfbook for me. The process boils down to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your CUPS server (e.g., http://localhost:631), create a copy of the configuration for the printer you want to enable brochure printing for. Let's call the new printer \"Print-booklet\".\n\n*Edit /etc/cups/ppd/Print-booklet.ppd as root. Add the following line, e.g., before the *cupsFilter entry: *cupsPreFilter: \"application/pdf 0 booklettopdf\".\n\n*(This step is a bit messy, perhaps it can be done in a cleaner way.) In \n/usr/lib/cups/filter, create the script booklettopdf (as root):\n#!/bin/sh\nfor e in \"$@\"; do echo DEBUG: $0: $e 1>&2; done\nTMPFILE=$(mktemp)\necho DEBUG: $0: $TMPFILE 1>&2\nif [ \"$6\" = \"\" ]; then\n    cat\nelse\n    cat \"$6\"\nfi | pdfbook --scale 0.97 --outfile $TMPFILE && cat $TMPFILE && rm $TMPFILE\n\n\n*Make the script executable: chmod +x booklettopdf.\n\n*Print a test page.\nNow, whenever you want to print in booklet format, choose the new printer \"Print-booklet\".\nThe cupsPreFilter is a CUPS PPD extension, and it seems that the application/pdf format will always appear in the filter chain (Ubuntu 12.10, perhaps earlier?).\nI'd vote for integrating this functionality into CUPS.\n\nA: Looks like currently there's no way to print pages in brochure (booklet) mode neither in Evince nor in Xpdf. There is a semi-solution to use psbook utility from the pstools package that will rearrange and output the pages in the postscript file so they go as in booklet mode. Please note the -s option of the psbook which controls the number of original pages that would go into one booklet. This is useful when you want to print large amount of pages that is not going to be folded all at once, but folded into several sub-booklets. For example, 120-page document would go into 30-sheet brochure by default, which is hard to fold. Using the psbook -s 24 will make 120/24=5 brochures 6 sheets each, which are easy to fold and then to combine together.\nAlso note that man -t output is not well prepared for booklet printing - it has page numbers on \"right\" side, not on the \"outer\" side, and \"left\" and \"right\" page margins are the same instead of \"inner\" margin being larger than \"outer\", and pages are not classified as \"left\" and \"right\". Discussion on how to tweak the man -t output goes here.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Gnome3 in Kubuntu 11.04 Just wondering if it is possible to install Gnome3 under Kubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: Yes.\nsudo apt-get install gnome3-session\n\nIf you want to know if a package is available, search Synaptic (or whatever package manager you want).

I install ubuntu on my HDD but can not use it on any computer\nInstalling Ubuntu 11.04 or any other distribution on an external hard drive connected to a computer via USB is about the same as the method used to install it on an internal hard disk. Your choice of external disk to use are many, but the one I used for this tutorial is a 2.5′ hard disk that I put in a similarly-sized hard disk enclosure.\nA 320 GB 2.5′ hard disk purchased for this tutorial cost US $45. Enclosures tend to be very cheap. The one I bought cost about US $7. At 5′x2.75′, the whole unit can fit comfortably in any pocket. You can use it to clone your Ubuntu 11.04 installation that you carry along with you. And with the USB connection, you can use it on any computer that can boot off a USB device.\nextDisk\n\nA: OP answered his or her own question within the question. I moved the answer here\n\nTo start, connect the disk via the USB cable to any computer and boot the computer using an Ubuntu 11.04 CD or DVD. At the disk partitioning step, select “Something else.” Doing that and clicking on Forward will take you to the installer’s advanced partitioning tool, which you are going to use to configure the partitions for Ubuntu 11.04.\ndualBoot4\nIf the computer you are using has only one hard disk, the external drive you are attempting to use will be detected as /dev/sdb. The “b” shows that it is the second disk detected by the system. The task now is to select the disk and configure the partitions for Ubuntu.\nNote: If you are intend to use this installation for serious stuff, it is better that you encrypt the disk. That entails using an Alternate Installer ISO image. You may use how to install Ubuntu 11.04 on an encrypted LVM file system as a guide, if you decide to follow that route.\nBy default, Ubuntu’s installer configures two partitions – the first for /, the root directory, and the second for Swap. When creating partitions for installing any desktop Linux distribution, my recommendation is to create the following four partitions:\n/boot, the boot partition. This is where programs critical for booting the system will reside.\n/, the root directory. The bulk of the programs used for running the system will be installed here.\nSwap, unformatted disk space for use as virtual memory.\n/home, the partition where your home directory will be located. In the course of using the system, files and folders you create will reside in various folders here.\n\nTo begin configuration, select the free space as shown, and click on Add.\neBuntu\nThe first partition will be for /boot. When setting up an LVM-based system using an Alternate Installer ISO image, the default disk space allocated to /boot is 258 MB. However, only about 22 MB of that is used, so anything thing between that size range will do. For this tutorial, the default will be used. The mount point will, of course, be /boot. The default file system is ext2. OK.\neBuntu1\nThe second partition will be for Swap, disk space that the computer may use as virtual memory. The suggested size for Swap is 2000 MB. Select “swap area” from the “Use as” dropdown menu. OK.\neBuntu2\nThe third partition will be for /, the root directory. The default journaling file system on Ubuntu 11.04 is ext4. You may stick with it or choose another journaling file system available. The installer recommends a minimum of 4.4 GB for Ubuntu 11.04, but on a new installation, less than 3 GB of disk space allocated to / is used. Note that as you install additional application after installation, disk space used will grow, so be generous here. I think 10 GB should be more than enough. OK.\neBuntu3\nThe last partition will be for /home. The file system is ext4, and you may allocate all available disk space to it. OK.\neBuntu4\nAll the partitions have been configured. Before clicking Install Now, you need to change where GRUB, the boot loader, will be installed. By default, it will be installed in the MBR of the computer’s internal disk. But that is not what you want. You want to install GRUB in the MBR of the external disk. So, under the “Device for boot loader installation” section, click on the dropdown menu, and select the entry that matches the external disk that you just partitioned. Once that is done, continue with the rest of the installation.\nAfter installation, test the system by booting the computer from the disk. You may use this as a mobile clone of your Ubuntu 11.04 installation.\neBuntu5\n\nA: I have done this with my hard drive, and I did it so that I still had 250GB to use as a normal hard drive, and then 70GB for Ubuntu. The method I used was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn a CD or make a LiveUSB with ubuntu on it (pendrivelinux is very good, so is YUMI for the thumb drive)\n\n*In Windows, go to Disk Management, and with the external drive plugged in, delete all partitions, so that in the end you see it say X GB unallocated, with X being the whole amount of the external HDD.\n\n*Boot of the CD/USB Flash Drive which you prepared, and select install. Make sure your empty External HDD is plugged in.\n\n*From install, choose 'Something Else'\n\n*You should see a list of disks, your drive is most likely dev/sdb, but just check to make sure.  It'll be the one which just says 'free space'.\n\n*You need to make two partitions. the first will be 4000MB and will be a swap area. Add this by pressing the add button while the 'free space' row in your external HDD is selected.\n\n*The second partition will be ext4, and can be any size you like. If you want to use up the whole drive, put it to the max it will go. in mount point, type '/' without spaces or the quotes.\n\n*At the bottom of the partitioner, there is an option for where to put the bootloader. make sure to select your drive.\n\n*Press install now and continue!\n\n*to boot, restart the computer but go into BIOS (when starting up press the specified key, F2 for Vaios, F8 for Dells, etc.) from there, go to the boot options, and there should be a list of boot priorities. move 'External Media' or whatever your computer's version of this is, to the top. save these settings and switch on again with the HDD plugged in. You should boot into Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG stopped working my wlan works right after i installed ubuntu 11.04, after several hours it just stop detecting my wlan. my wlan is an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan} Network Connection (rev 02). i downloaded driver for linux from intel website but i don't know how to install it. PLEASE HELP!\n\nA: I have the same network hardware in my laptop.  It works just fine with the standard driver that came with Ubuntu.  When it stops seeing wireless networks, that usually means I've accidentally toggled the wifi kill switch on the front of my laptop.\nI've had occasional problems, through, with earlier versions of Ubuntu.  Sometimes those problems were resolved by unloading and reloading the driver module:\nsudo modprobe -r iwl3945\nsudo modprobe iwl3945\n\nalthough I should mention that at one point the unload command used to cause the entire system to freeze.  Caveat emptor.\n\nA: I realise the OP to this question was last seen in July, so my answer is more generic.  To resolve problems like this will probably need some interaction to try out stuff.\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggestion 1:\n\n\nWhy do you need to install a new driver?  Sometimes the version in the kernel is buggy.  Fortunately, the kernel team do release a backport of new & updated drivers & their firmware a few months after each Ubuntu release.  For natty, you can install this by:\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-2.6.39-generic\n\nThen reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggestion 2:\n\n\nCheck if the wireless card is actually blocked.  Running rfkill list is very useful - if the wireless is actually recognised there can be two types of blocking being reported - a soft block and a hard block.\nA hard-block is likely to be a hardware switch - a physical hardware switch/ a Fn key switch or maybe a BIOS option.\nA soft-block can sometimes be resolved by running:\nsudo rfkill unblock wifi; sudo rfkill unblock all\n\nFollowed by either:\nifconfig wlan0\n\nto start the wireless lan OR select \"enable wireless\" on Network Manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggestion 3:\n\n\nRemoving and readding the kernel module can sometimes activate the wireless card.  It is also very useful to diagnose what the Kernel errors are:\nsudo modprobe -r iwl3945\nsudo modprobe iwl3945\ndmesg | tail -n 50\n\nHave a close look at the output - sometimes a firmware update can resolve this - see the linked question below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Suggestion 4:\n\n\nRunning the modprobe options above should write out a iwl3945.conf file in \\etc\\modprobe.d\\.  The dmesg message could indicate that an alernative value(s) are required e.g. \nalias wlan0 iwl3945\noptions iwl3945 disable_hw_scan=1\n\nsource\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill\"?\n\nA: Using Lubuntu 18.04 on a machine with an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG, it turned out that it was the power saving that was killing the device and not returning it correctly. In the boot it warned that trying to suspend the device may lead to corruption - which peaked my interest.\nAccording to another AskUbuntu post [1] by @user3273814, you simply need to disable the power management for your wireless device:\n\nTo turn off power management, go to /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf and you will see\n[connection]\nwifi.powersave = 3\nChange the 3 to a 2 and reboot.\n\nIt's now been running as a wireless server for 2 days without issue, so I assume this is now fixed given it would only go for a few hours before.

Video files were encoded with MP4 and MKV(HEVC)\nAlso if you install SMPlayer with Snap repository, you'll need to go to 'Ubuntu Software' manager and adjust its permission to be able to read file off a removable drive like USB and encrypted partitions.\n\n", "Q: Nautilus Advanced Features I'm using nautilus as file manager for local and remote ftp files.\nI'm interested in some advanced features and how they can be achieved.\n\n\n*\n\n*Default extra pane.\n\n*Synchronised browsing between two panes.\n\n*Copy file from one pane to another with keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Ignore .svn files while copying entire folders.\n\n\nA: I use http://www.nautilus-actions.org/ to add custom context menu options for special file types (i.e. to render rST files)\nUpdate: I just realized that you don't want a list of all advanced features but the specific ones you listed.

In Is a 40GB SSD practical to use for ' / ' Jorge describes how he symlinks things in his /home that would benefit from being on an SSD. How is this done?\nI've figured that I need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory on the SSD to hold what I want to link from /home, e.g. mkdir /var/jorge.\n\n*Move the things from /home that should be on the SSD, e.g. mv /home/jorge/.config /var/jorge.\n\n*Create the symlinks, e.g. ln -s /var/jorge/.config /home/jorge/.config.\n\n\nIs this the correct way to proceed? Do I need to do it from a live CD?\n\nA: You can do it from a Live CD, but if you logout from a graphical session and switch to a virtual console using Ctrl + Alt + F1, you'll be able to move the folders too.\nYour steps are correct, some expansion below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a virtual console and login\n\n*Mount the SSD if needed, that can be as easy as:\nsudo mkdir /media/ssd-store\nsudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/YOUR-SSD-NAME /media/ssd-store\n\nYou can use tab-completion after /dev/disk/by-label/. This only works if your partition has a label, otherwise you need to replace it by /dev/sdXY\n\n*create a folder that holds the files from home:\nsudo mkdir -p /media/ssd-store/home/jorge\n\nIf you've a custom umask setting like 0027, you need to sudo chmod 755 /media/ssd-store. You can check your umask setting by running umask (defaults to 0022)\n\n*Change the ownership if needed, so the user can always create more symlinks if needed:\nsudo chown jorge: /media/ssd-store/home/jorge\n\n\n*Move the files (add sudo if you do not own /media/ssd-store/home/jorge):\nmv /home/jorge/.config /media/ssd-store/home/jorge/\n\n\n*Create the symlink:\nln -s /media/ssd-store/home/jorge/.config /home/jorge/\n\nNotes on the above: you should add an entry in /etc/fstab for automounting the SSD. Use sudo blkid to determine the UUID for your SSD partition and add the next line to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=[uuid] /media/ssd-store ext4 relatime,errors=remount-ro,discard 0 2\n\n", "Q: What in /home would benefit from being on an SSD? In Is a 40GB SSD practical to use for ' / ' Jorge describes how he symlinks directories in his /home that would benefit from being on an SSD. The directories he names are \n\n\n*\n\n*~/.cache\n\n*~/.config\n\n*~/.gconf\nI know how to make the symlinks. What I am asking for is if this is a good list of directories in /home that benefits from being on an SSD? I figure that good items on such a list are files that are read often. The reason for asking this is that I cannot fit all of /home on the SSD but I still want to get as much performance out of the SSD as possible.\n\nA: I would put everything on the SSD, provided that it's a modern SSD (i.e. fast and doesn't suffer from poor write-leveling), and provided that everything fits.\nThe latency improvement is really something.\n\nA: I would just have the root directory (/) as SSD. Keep /home on a HDD (since in my experience, it can take -loads- of room). Also the /boot on the SSD, if you are going to make separate partitions. That way you have the loading time benefits of SSD. That's my opinion.\nif you really wanted to use the SSD for home, I would put the configuration folders on there (the /.whatever) folders, to speed up configuration loading. It wouldn't be as fast as loading the entire program from SSD, but it's an improvement nonetheless. I don't know how to map certain elements of /home to the SSD however, but the mount command comes to mind\n\nA: Here's a list of other things that might be useful (I've made this a wiki post so anyone can add to it):\n\n\n*\n\n*.cache - temporty cache files for browsers and other programs.\n\n*.config - config files for programs\n\n*.gconfd abd .gconf - GNOME configuration files\n\n*.gegl-0.0 – file for GIMP\n\n*.gimp-2.6 – files for GIMP\n\n*.gnome2 – used by some GNOME 2 applications\n\n*.gvfs – data folder for the GNOME virtual filesystem\n\n*.local – user specific data. You will lose the Nautilus Trash functionality if this directory is put on a different partition.\n\n*.macromedia – files for flash\n\n*.mozilla – where all your Mozilla Firefox cache is\n\n*.thumbnails – thumbnails for pictures, videos, etc (used by Nautilus)\n\n*.thunderbird – where all your Mozilla Thunderbird cache is\n\n\nA: What I would advise, is have everything in one big / partition on the SSD (including your home directories), and then, if the SSD is not big enough for all your large files, mount your HDD separately as, say, /media/BigHDD or whatever, and put your large files there.\nThat way, all your dotfiles (files and directories beginning with a dot in your home directory) will be on the SSD, including new ones that software might create.  It is often these dotfiles (particularly .cache) that are frequently read and written to and therefore would benefit from SSD the most.  But that isn't to say other files and directories wouldn't also benefit.\nIf your SSD space is not particularly limited, there is no reason to keep anything off of it.  Have everything on it.  Then, if you need to store lots of large files, such as for video editing, photography, your music collection, etc and these don't fit on there, then have a separately mounted drive for these.\nI used to use an Asus EeePC 900.  That thing had a 4GB primary SSD.  That is limited space, requiring careful partitioning.  A 40GB SSD is not limited.\nIf I had to write a list of what things would most benefit from being on an SSD I'd put them in this order.\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.cache - the cache area of your home directory, where software like browsers keep their cache.\n\n*/usr and /lib - just to improve start-up time of applications, and boot time.\n\n*/etc - some software needs to read a lot of files in here when it starts.\n\n*/tmp - some software uses this for temporary storage, but less so for user software.\n\n*/var - system software sometimes stores temporary or frequently changing files here.\n\n*~/.config - config files for your user software and account.\nAs you can see, it's somewhat spread out over the drive.\nIt may be more useful to see a list of what doesn't benefit so much from being on an SSD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media files, like music and videos.\n\n*Any other large documents, like the original images if you do photography.\n\n*Backups or large archives (eg, of other systems)\n", "Q: networkmanager in kubuntu does not show DSL connection !

Before that I had only ubuntu on my hard disk. It seems like my \"home\"-folder is the same as my windows home folder. Do I put config files in there? It seems like the directory structure is different than I had before when I only had ubuntu OS on my hard disk. Thanks for advice!\n\nA: I don't fully understand your question, so I'm afraid my answer will include a bit of irrelevant information.\nWhen you use Wubu, Ubuntu resides in a disk image, which lives as a single file on your Windows partition (c:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk).  Your Ubuntu home folder is there too.  This, by the way, makes all disk access much slower when you've booted Ubuntu through Wubi, compared to a native installation, or at least that's my impression.\nWhen you've actually booted into Ubuntu, you can access the Windows filesystem at /host, which is the only directory structure difference that I can think of.  (When you use a regular Ubuntu installation alongside Windows, in a dual-boot configuration, the Windows filesystem is usually at /media/disk or something similar.)\nI haven't played with a Wubi system in a long while, but I find it easy to believe that Wubi creates a symbolic link (or a few) from your Ubuntu home directory to your Windows home folder.  I don't think the entire home directory will be shared -- Ubuntu and Windows use different filesystems that support different features, have different filename restrictions, etc -- but I suppose the Desktop folder might be.\n", "Q: \"respawning too fast, stopped\". How to make UPSTART disable for 5 mins? In the old days, the init daemon used to disable tasks that were respawning too fast.\nI discovered to my peril that UPSTART just stops them. forever.\nI have found the COUNT and INTERVAL controls for when to stop a job that is respawning fast, but I cannot find how to restart that job after a specified waiting time. \n\n\n*\n\n*This is for a remote server that must connect via ssh in order for me to tunnel back into it. But it regularly has connection problems and the job that runs the ssh connection is dying! I foolishly expected upstart to keep the job running. \n\n\nIs there a way, or do I need to do something like run a cron job to check if it is running and if not restart it?\n\nA: Upstart allows a post-stop sleep in order to delay the restarting of a job. From http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#delay-respawn-of-a-job\npost-stop exec sleep 5\n\nNow when the job fails, it will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect again. Combine that with setting the respawn to something like 10 times in 30 seconds and it should try to respawn forever (it would only try 7 times in 30 seconds, so it shouldn't get kicked out of respawn)\n", "Q: Configuring SKS to sync with other KeyServers Is there a procedure that needs to be followed in order to get an SKS keyserver to sync with other keyservers (specifically, Ubuntu's keyservers)?  If so, what is that process?\n\nA: If it is a keyserver you manage, it should be a matter of adding peers to the \"membership\" file, and having the administrators of those peers add your server to their \"membership\" files.  Depending on the counterparty servers, you may find that you need to use PKS synchronisation via email: this is probably best discussed with the counterparty administrators.  Specific instructions are available in the SKS README, and if you have a peering relationship with one of the larger keyservers, the admins there can likely help with specifics related to their preferred peering arrangements.\nIn the specific case of synchronisation with the Ubuntu keyservers, you may either work with other keyserver admins in the wide public set, with which the Ubuntu keyserver regularly synchronises, or to request counterparty configuration directly from the Ubuntu keyserver, open an request at http://rt.ubuntu.com/ .  Be aware that the administrators of this service are very busy, so there may be some delay before you get a response.  Note that your keyserver may need to meet certain conditions in order to be accepted as a peer.\nIf you seek synchronisation between some third-party keyserver and the Ubuntu keyserver, you would need to ask the admins of the third-party keyserver to request peering (either to the Ubuntu keyserver or to some keyserver with which the Ubuntu keysrever is peered (directly or indirectly)).  In this case, it is probably easier to just upload your key(s) to one of the keyservers already in sync with the Ubuntu keyserver.\n", "Q: what kind of support or performance can i expect from ubuntu on a chromebook? has anyone installed a ubuntu on a chromebook (acer or samsung ) yet?

Especially given that it requires sudo?\n\nA: I don't think use of /etc/fstab will work (it didn't work for me) because that file is processed before the SF module is loaded and will fail to mount the share, see HOWTO: Use Shared Folders 1.\n\nA: Auto-mount shared folders using Virtual Box Manager\nFrom Virtual Box > 4.0 we are able to auto mount shared folders in a virtual machine. To do so for Ubuntu we\n\n*\n\n*need to install Guest Additions in the guest OS\n\n*make sure users are in group vboxsf\n\n*define shared folders from the Virtual Box Manager\n\nRight click on your virtual machine and choose Settings->Shared Folders. This will list existing shares or lets you define a new shared folde by clicking on the blue folder icon with the green +-sign on the top right side:\n\nChoose your folder from the dropdown menu Folder path or choose Define other for a file selector that lists the host filesystem. Choose a name for the share (e.g. myshares). By ticking Auto-mount this folder will always be mounted in the Ubuntu guest directory /media/sf_myshares (the prefix sf_ will automatically be added).\n\nAlternatively, to define shared folders in a running guest OS we may select Devices -> Shared Folders from the window menu of Virtual Box Manager:\n\nBy ticking Make Permanent these shared folders will also be available on the next boot and will be mounted when Auto-mount is ticked in addition.\n\nA: This is not a complete answer yet, but more like guidelines on 2 approaches you have:\n1 - You could edit /etc/fstab and add this mount there. You would need to translate your mount parameter to fstab syntax. A wild guess would be something like /home/jamesw/host vboxsf myshare,umask=002,uid=<youruser>,gid=plugdev  0  0. You would need sudoto edit your fstab, but, once done, it will be auto-mounted on boot. Since this is done before you even log in, you need an absolute path to the mount point (hence /home/jamesw/host), you can not use $HOME or ~. Hint: \"host\" folder don't need to exist. If it is in fstab, mount will create it for you.\n2 - You could use fusermount instead of mount. The syntax is similar (but not identical, so you still need to translate the mount parameters). Fusermount requires your mount point to be somewhere inside your $HOME, but the biggest advantage is that you would not need sudo. And the mount will be avaliable in Nautilus (as if it was a CD or USB key). After you get the right parameters and test it, you can add it to your ~/.profile, which runs every time you log in.\nEDIT: Im assuming that either Virtualbox dont need the machine to be actually runing for it to share folders, OR that it is up and running before you log in\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 guest and shared folders automounting accessible by normal user\nIn order to automount and access those folders as normal user, specific steps are required.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use official guest additions.

I have burnt a Ubuntu 11.04 CD. During the installation there's an option; \"Upgrade to 11.04\". Will choosing this option affect my Windows partition? I don't want my Windows partition to be affected.\n\nA: \nThe option \"upgrade 10.04 to 11.04\" is not like upgrading 10.04 to 11.04 via an upgrade to 10.10.. This option means that all data from your /home will be preserved but you will have to reinstall your idividual applications and you will also have to create your users again. User setting from these applications (including passwords in the keyring) will be preserved.\n\"Upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04\" therefore is like a clean installation (i.e. \"Erase Ubuntu and reinstall\") but without formatting your drive and without erasing /home.\nAs with all OS upgrades it is strongly recommended to backup your data before you proceed.\nYour Windows partition(s) will only be touched and deleted by choosing \"Erase everything\".\n\nA: Since long ago, all LiveCD installations from Ubuntu give the option to delete the whole partition, install side by side with the OS you already have installed and even resize the partition if you want to give more or less to Ubuntu. So the answer is NO it will not delete your windows. You have to literally tell it to do so with an option that says something like \"Delete the partition and install Ubuntu\".\nI can vouch for 9.10, 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04. Do not remember from way back more. You do not loose data, corrupt the hard drive, etc..\n\nA: The upgrade option won't touch windows, and all going to plan, should not damage your data on your Ubuntu partition either. However many things can go wrong with an update, especially with regards to the install media, so like previous posters have said, back up your data. \nIt certainly wouldn't hurt to put your /home data on a separate partition, at least then you can format the system partition, if need be, without harming either your personal files or program configurations. The programs would need to be reinstalled however\n\nA: Don't worry, Windows won't be touched if you click 'Upgrade Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to 11.04' If you click 'Erase everything and reinstall' then Windows will still be installed, but everything will be gone like Documents, Pictures, Programs etc. Just make sure that you click Upgrade Ubuntu!\n\nA: you can't upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04, you need to upgrade to 10.10 first od do a clean install of 11.04.

Most things work as I expect them, but when I switch back to my main [ubuntu 10.04] desktop, numlock gets turned off.  \nI suspect that it looks to the computer like the keyboard is just plugged in.  However, the FunctionLock key doesn't get switched.  (The keyboard is a split keyboard with a FunctionLock feature that allows the F1 to F12 keys for other purposes).

I have try using ping command, but it shows error, i guess this because / character.\nCan anyone can help me? or is there another way?\n\nA: There certainly is another way - but this requires understanding what actually happens when a request is made over the Internet. When you visit a page in your web browser, data is transferred using a protocol called HTTP (yes, this is why you'll often see http:// at the beginning of URLs).\nHTTP is a text-based protocol. Information is exchanged between the client and the server by sending headers followed by the body of the request. The headers contain a lot of status information about the request and the information being transferred. The header that you will be interested in to help you with your problem isn't really a header at all - it's the very first line transferred and contains a number called the status code. This number is 3 digits and conveys status information. If a request was successful, the result is usually 200 (not always - there are exceptions).\nOne thing is for sure - if the file you have requested does not exist on the web server, the server should reply with a status code of 404. This indicates that the resource could not be found. (For the curious, here is a list of HTTP status codes and their meaning.)\nWell, enough theory. Let's see how we can do this on the terminal. A great tool for fetching requests using HTTP that also provides us with the ability to examine the status code is cURL, which is available in the Ubuntu repos. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install curl\n\nOnce you have it installed, you can invoke it like so:\ncurl [website]\n\n...and the content of the given URL will be printed to the terminal. This is the information that your web browser sees when it visits that URL. How does this help us? Well, take a close look at the flags for the curl command. If we pass the parameter --head, cURL will return only the headers from the request. Try it with a URL. You'll get a list of lines of the form:\nheader-name: header-value\n\nNotice, of course, that the very first line looks nothing like this. Remember the status code that we talked about earlier? You'll notice it in the first line as the three-digit number. What we need to do now is extract it from the first line using Perl - and we can do it in the terminal using Perl's -e flag which let's us pass Perl code directly to the Perl interpreter. We'll also need to add an extra flag to cURL (--silent) in order to keep it from displaying a progress bar and messing up our Perl script.\nHere is what we need... it's quite complicated due to the need to escape a lot of it from the shell:\n\nperl -e \"\\$s=\\`curl [URL] --head --silent\\`; \\$s=~m/(\\\\d{3})/;print \\$1\"\n\nWhat this is basically doing is fetching the URL with cURL and running it through a Perl regular expression that extracts the status code and prints it out.\nNow all you need to is put in the URL of the file you are checking for and compare it to '404'. If you get '404', you can assume the file does not exist.\nOf course, this could be very difficult to manipulate in the terminal, so you can write a small script that makes this not only easier to understand, but also easier to execute:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\n# Get the URL\n$url = $ARGV[0];\n\n# Fetch the header\n$header = `curl $url --head --silent`;\n\n# Try to find the status code\n$header =~ m/(\\d{3})/;\n\n# Return the result\nexit(0) if $1 == 404;\nexit(1);\n\nSimply copy and paste that into a file. For this example, I'll call the file url_check. Then make the file executable with:\nchmod 755 url_check\n\nThen you can check any file with the following simple command:\n\n./url_check [URL]\n\nThe return value will be '0' if the server returned a 404 and '1' otherwise. You can then chain this command in the shell just like you would any other command.\n\nA: You can use the --spider option of wget, which does not actually download the file, but just checks if it's there.

Inside emit_event, it calls ply_boot_client_flush(), then constructs the env array, calls upstart_emit_event(), then dbus_pending_call_block(). And there it hangs. So any ideas why dbus_pending_call_block would hang indefinitely? Broken plymouth? dbus? upstart? Any suggestions for fixes or further diagnostics?\nReboot of my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 64bit AMD machine hangs 100%. The drive access light is off, but the alt-sysreq keys do work. The hardware is a Lenovo W700ds laptop. Now, I apologize in advance, because I'm very limited in the information about the system I have available, and in what I can do with it (because it will not boot). I can boot from the 10.04 CD - using it like a rescue disk. I can fsck, mount and read & write to my partitions - they are fine. I already tried reformatting my swap with mkswap. I have 4 ext4 partitions on my system: sda1 is /, sda2 is /usr, sda3 is /home, and a 4th that I use for data storage /sdb1 (is the entire disk, mounts at the mountpoint /hdb which I created). There is also /sda4 which is swap. Right now I am writing this from a browser I have opened in the 'rescue session' from the 10.04 LTS install CD.\nI would GREATLY appreciate suggestions/comments on what I could do to help diagnose what is hanging, why, and what I could do to fix it. I've done a websearch already, but found nothing new along these lines (some 1-1.5 year old bug reports with similar symptoms, but their fixes did not work).\nI installed 10.04 on a new disk around the first of July, then used aptitude to bring everything up to date. Since then I've been installing LOTS of packages (I'll attach the dpkg log below). With sda being 750GB (/ 20GB, /usr 80GB) I had lots of space to install packages that I 'might someday use'. I wonder if its one of these packages I installed that has screwed up my system? I installed kernel 2.6.32-32-generic and rebooted, but have installed many more packages since. I reboot this machines as rarely as possible - preferring to hibernate it while going from place to place. Lately though, I noticed some strange behavior associated with de-hibernation: when the system would de-hibernate it brings up the gnome screen saver with the a password needed to unlock - well, it would not recognize my password! I had to alt-F1, log in as root, and kill the screen saver. Then all would be fine, or so it seemed. Also, upon de-hibernation I would frequently see for a short while blinking colorful garbage on the screen. It would go away, so I didn't try to find the cause. Another possibly relevant point is that I needed to use \"nomodeset\" in the installation of 10.04, and when bringing up the rescue shell from that same CD, if I use only nomodeset it will eventually hang with a flashing NumLock LED or Caps Lock LED (crash?), but if I also use \"noapic nolapic acpi=off\" then it comes up ok. I've tried these options with my system to see if they cure the boot hang problem - they do not.\nThis is a machine I use for work as well as for nearly everything else, so getting it to boot again is a TOP priority. /home is intact, which is good. But I'm about at my wits end in trying to diagnose (much less fix) this cause of the hung boot.\nI boot the system, and it starts running the mountall config script in /etc/init/mountall.conf. I see output from mountall running fsck - 4 lines that say:\nfsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2 (thats one per ext4 partition). Then there are 4 more lines from fsck informing the user that the partitions were found to be \"clean\". And that is it - everything just stops. The drive activity LED goes off. I can use the alt-sysreq keys, but they have so far not proven useful. I saw a bug report where one user used alt-sysreq-i to kill process and it dropped him into a shell. For me, it does say it has killed processes (udev and udev-bridge and plymouth, says its respawning udev, etc), but I do not get any shell.\nI have been trying to determine what exactly is hanging. To this end, I've tinkered with /etc/init/mountall.conf. I have added echo lines, and I have added the -v (verbose) option to the exec of mountall. No echo lines after the exec of mountall are shown, so this may mean mountall is hanging. Or, it may not be displaying the last of the output - in which case mountall may have exited and something else may be hanging. I note that alt-sysreq-i does not say mountall is killed. I've tried to narrow down what the system might be hanging on by commenting out sda3 (/home), swap and sdb1 (/hdb) from fstab, but it still hangs.\nThere is alot I can do myself, but feel like I'm in over my head here. I would like to, for example, get the source code for mountall, add printed flags, recompile and stick it on my system - to narrow down A) if mountall is actually hanging, and B) what is it hanging on. BUT, I can not boot my machine to a shell from which to compile within - and the rescue disk environment is only 2.6.32-28-generic #55 - so it would not match my system. I'd like to remove or reinstall packages, but again, I can not boot my machine and do this. \n(my dpkg log file is several MBs, so I will attach it in a following dialog box)\nThanks,\nGreg\n\nA: Denwerko: I have done nothing to my machine that should have produced this result. It was pretty stable under Ubuntu 9.10 - never had anything like this happen. All of the tinkering with source, recompiling things - its all been user-space code. I have not been tinkering at all with the OS. Nor have I installed any OS-space code outside of the standard channels (aptitude/synaptic package manager, deb packages obtainedthrough those tools).  Greg yesterday\nHowever, I've obtained the source code to mountall 2.15.3 and got it to compile in the rescue environment, after 5 installs (libnih-dev, libnihdbus-dev, lindbus-1-dev, linudev-dev, libplymouth-dev). I've added debugging prints in the code via nih_info() calls, and I've made the spawns that execute fsck blocking instead of non-blocking. I'm working on the theory that mountall is crashing somewhere (or nih, or dbus or plymouth...). I do not seem to get output to the same place in the code each run, but it seems to stop sometime after the remount of /dev/sda1 to / - in the mounted() routine.  Greg yesterday\nI've also been doing dpkg -r of packages via chroot as you suggested, and that seems to work (except for one deinstall script that wanted to do something with /proc). I deinstalled wine, and the 32bit compatability packages it needed (lib32nss, ia32lib, lib32v4l, etc) and several ibus packages that are not installed on in the rescue environment (some ibus packages are, and I was carefull not to remove those)-removed plasma-widget-kimpanel-backend-ibus, ibus-qt4, ibus-qt1. None of this affected the problem, so I've removed more packages I don't need now (wx widget & jdk packages, etc)-no effect\nUPDATE:\nIt seems mountall is hanging inside the routine emit_event(), which it calls after / is remounted to emit and event to that effect. Inside emit_event, it calls ply_boot_client_flush(), then constructs the env array, calls upstart_emit_event(), then dbus_pending_call_block(). And there it hangs. So any ideas why dbus_pending_call_block would hang indefinitely? Broken plymouth? dbus? upstart? Any suggestions for fixes or further diagnostics?\nSOLUTION\nSo, it seems I had installed cloud-init and cloud-utils because I though someday I might want to play with it. Will, turns out cloud-init screws with the ureadahead configuration, and launches when the dbus event 'mounted /' happens, which caused my system to hang as soon as it sent out that dbus message, which happens after / gets remounted from ro to r/w. I deinstalled cloud-init and cloud-utils and all seems ok now. Except, I'm sleepy and have lost 24hours of my life :\\\n", "Q: How can I determine which font is broken? There's a bug in the way Ubuntu displays Japanese fonts that I need fixed rather urgently.\nThe bug is that Ubuntu displays the wrong Japanese characters sometimes.\nI'm studying Japanese, and having the wrong characters display is obviously problematic.\nHowever, as you can see if you look at the most recent comments on the bug report, fixing the bug seems stalled on the fact that some specific fonts are probably broken, but I don't know which ones.\nHere's what I think is happening. If Japanese text is used in a context where the specified font does not contain Japanese characters, then Ubuntu defaults to some other font for the words that are written in Japanese.\nHowever, it is unclear to me what that default Japanese font would be, and how I can determine it.\nIs there a way I can determine the default font being used when I see text on my screen that is showing the faulty characters?\n\nA: Source: bug 616169 comment made by martin-autotelic\nQuote:\n\nI've solved this problem for me.

I've tried so many combinations - all I want is a fast Ubuntu Live USB disk with persistence that works. What I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using unetbootin on my Mac, choosing some \"Space used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only)\". \n\n*\n\n*Result: Doesn't boot at all.\n\n\n*Using unetbootin on my Mac, choosing no such space.\n\n*\n\n*Result: Boots fine and very fast (doesn't even show the annoying dialog \"Try ubuntu/install ubuntu\" at startup!), but has no persistence. (So I have to choose my keyboard layout, install programs I need, etc. every time)\n\n\n*Using Startup Disk Creator from my Ubuntu 11.04 installation.\n\n*\n\n*Result: I cannot choose \"reserved extra space\" at all. It's greyed out. I know I know, there was bug 557775, and many people say that the workaround from comment #4 works for them.

But after booting, I get the screen \"Try ubuntu/install ubuntu\". Clicking on \"Try ubuntu\" takes me to the desktop - but only after waiting 5 minutes (every time!). It also doesn't seem to keep my keyboard settings.\n\n\n\nI know, that instead of creating a startup disk, I could install a full ubuntu system on the USB stick. But as far as I know, this isn't very good, because /tmp and similar directories will then also be on the USB disk, which is a) slow, and b) not very good for the USB disk due to frequent overwriting.\nI'm frustrated. So has anybody managed to create a working Ubuntu 11.04 Live USB disk with persistence?\n\nA: I've used a 1GB flash drive and because of the sheer volume of the ISO image compared to the space on the drive creating some persistent space is not only next to impossible it's also just not feasible because you'd have a VERY small amount of space for stuff to save off to. Grab a 4 to 8 GB flash drive, put on the ISO using the Ubuntu built in USB startup disk maker and it should work. At least it did for me. \nOne other thing you can also try (I've done it so it should work.) is take an external HD that you can plug into the system via USB (Like a Western Digital backup drive for example.) and then what you do is take out the HD from your pc, plug in the external one into the usb ports, and then you (should be able to) install to that external drive from the ubuntu install menu. Then when you're all said and done you've got an external hard drive that is persistent because well, it's a whole OS!\nI would also recommend that you take a look at the following link/question. It goes into a bit more detail on how to do what you're asking... Points down to the link \nInstall Ubuntu on USB Flash Drive or USB powered external HDD?\n\nA: Ok, just to help others out. I had to do the \"move the ISO to the tmp folder\" to get the persistent space for docs that I was moving. \nHowever, once you do that you have to know how to get to those freaking files on your new system. The USB stick doesn't let you just navigate through and find those files. \nSo...\nMount the casper dir on the USB using something like this:  \nmkdir /myfiles\nsudo mount -o loop /media/XXXX-USB-blah/casper-rw /myfiles\n\nThen you still have to chown the files before you can move them.\nHope that helps :-)\n\nA: I am currently writing to you from such an installation.  It is the third in a series of USB SSD media I've made for myself, all clones of one another.  Since this one was first made about three years ago, I've made a second series for non personal use, with 38 copies made at last count.  All are fresh and new for the next user, all made from a regularly updated master.  And before you ask, no, I'm not offering to sell you one, but I might give you one if you reimburse me for media.  For now I'll focus on method and you can consider using my method yourself.\nMy current such drive which I refer to as a \"Mubuntstick\" which is sort of acronym for my last initial \"M\" Ubuntu Stick, consists of this USB3-mSATA adapter.  I describe it somewhat in my bio on this site.  Inside of which I'm currently using only this 64gb mSATA SSD, though as you can see you can purchase a much larger one if that's what you want to do. I've read many reviews and these seem to get better ratings for benchmark speed and reliability.\nYou are probably wondering why I'm on my third.  There are two reasons, actually, and they are reasons that relate to one of your concerns.  My first two were Patriot Rage Pro XT and very fast, roughly identical in performance when connected to computers equipped with USB 2.0 ports, but the second in blue was actually USB 3.0.  After one year of very heavy use the first one began to slow down, not lose data, apparently but it became sluggish and so as a precaution I cloned it to a newer and possibly faster USB 3.0 version.  After another year of very heavy use it too became sluggish and as I wanted to upgrade the size I decided to try this heavier duty mSATA format while upgrading my capacity.  I had no idea this mSATA would be so much faster.  When connected to a high performance computer such as this quad core gamers desktop with 4gb RAM and an ATI graphics card, well, nobody would believe the main drive is interfaced with USB. \nYour original question was what's the best method of making it, and in my opinion, a straight up installation is the best method.  If you are worried about wearing out the drive with SWAPSPACE, there are a few solutions you can try, one of which is to made two such USB drives and format the second one as \"swap\", so that it is allocated instead of the primary data drive.  Personally I choose convenience.  I also recommend automatically timed backups of pertinent data, and periodic image backups of the entire installation so that you can burn a fresh one should your active one be lost, stolen or destroyed.\nI probably don't have to advise you to encrypt your data folders, but in case I do, I'm saying it now.\n", "Q: Resume after hibernate: monitor signal out-of-range I normally shut down the family Ubuntu 11.04 pc rather than hibernate, but my daughter didn't realise that and put the machine into hiberate. Now when we turn it back on, I see the POST output from the machine's BIOS, then the monitor just displays \"input signal out of range\" and we can't do interact with anything. This state has survived several power-off cycles, so I presume that the OS is keeping the hibernated session state somewhere, and because I haven't successfully managed to boot the pc it's still there.\nI'm currently running the machine from a live CD, so I can eliminate hardware failure as a problem. This means I can also make changes to the on-disk installation, but I'm not sure where to look. Where would Ubuntu store the hibernated session? Can I just delete that file? Any other suggestions as to how I can, er, restore normality? :)  As a last resort I can re-install 11.04, but I'd like to fix, or at least understand, the problem before I do that.\n\nA: Can you get into the Grub2 menu (ideally from your hard disk, otherwise from your LiveCD)? Try holding down the Shift key while booting!\nIf yes: In Grub2, select your Hard Disk Linux installation, press the 'e' (edit) key, then add \"noresume\" to the kernel parameters.

My current system is laid out across two drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*40GB for / and /swap (dev/sdb)\n\n*1TB for /home (dev/sdc)\n\n\nAs my /home drive is running out of space, and storage is cheap, I've bought a 2TB drive with the intent of expanding /home across that drive too (so /home is spread over two drives/3TB).\nI expected this to happen automagically (though I have no idea why I would expect that, really), the drive is installed (dev/sda), formatted as ext4, but I've no idea where to go next.

There is one downside to going this route and I'll explain it at the end.\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the mount point of your new 2TB drive. If the drive is currently mounted, you can easily find this information by running the mount command - which will list all currently mounted drives / partitions.\n\n*Once you have the mount point, you can create a symlink to that folder in your home directory by running the following command:\nln -s [MOUNT POINT]  ~/secondary\nThis will create a folder in your /home directory named secondary that contains all of the contents of your 2TB drive. Now whenever you want to save something to your 2TB drive, simply save it in the secondary folder.\nNow you've probably already spotted the downside to going this method. Although it is simple to set up, it doesn't automatically split content across the drive for you. You'll have to do this yourself. If you wanted to, you could copy all of the contents of a folder in your home directory (like Music or Desktop) to your 2TB drive and then replace 'secondary' with the name of that folder in the command above.\n\nA: Yes you would need to do some hacking with LVM,but I think you would lose your data once you setup as an LVM partition. LVM is great if you use it from the start, but a pain in the but if you change your mind later. I would back up all of your data and reinstall from scratch and setup all of your drives for LVM and then restore the data from before.\n", "Q: Adobe Flash Player is not working in Google Chrome I am using Ubuntu 11.04 and current versions of Google Chrome and Chromium.

At the moment there is no formal mechanism but you can as in #launchpad or file a support question against Launchpad itself.\n\nA: For new bug reports on Launchpad the terminology is triaging, rather than moderating.\nTriaging gives bugs a relative importance and priority, in addition to categorising them against the correct part of Ubuntu.  You can read more about the triaging facilities at:\n\n\n*\n\n*dev.launchpad.net/BugTriage\nOccasionally (but very rarely) patent nonsense gets filed in Launchpad, in which case it is marked \"Invalid\"—being impossible to process further.  Marketing spam added as comments to existing bug reports may also be deleted.\nDoes that answer your query?  Is there any area that you're still interested in, or which you'd like expanding with more detail?\n\nA: Is it moderated? Well depends upon what you mean by \"Moderated\". Is it customizable in regards to team creation and management? Yes, you can moderate your team(s) and/or project(s) on Launchpad. Quite easily too once you get the hang of it. But in general usage, difficult to say. Anyone can go look at the site and browse but to do anything you do actually have to register and confirm your account. From there it's pretty much \"Have at it...\" at least to me.\n\nA: Mostly not. Launchpad relies heavily on the community: bad bug reports are marked as invalid and simply forgotten.\nFor bad comments theres no \"report button\" but you can request removal on Launchpad Answers atleast for spam.\n", "Q: Where can I find ubuntu one contacts for android?

Now for the most part it runs fairly decent and quick, not much issue with it except one major one. \nEvery time I restart or turn on the netbook my brightness is set to full yet my screen is like almost full on black, like it's turned off. I turn down the brightness a couple times using the Fn + F5/F6 keys and it goes nice and bright etc. When I turn the netbook on I have to turn down my brightness level to see the screen at what (I think) is full brightness and it's then ok. If I turn it off and restart etc I have to do it all over again.\nDown is up kinda thing...it's an odd and annoying issue, one that I cannot find an answer for anywhere.

Neither better nor worse.\n\n*@fossfreedom I'll look deeper into your suggestion but at this time it looks almost the same as the second answer so I doubt it is what I currently seek. \n\nA: I had the same problem with my Asus Eee PC 1001PX. The solution was to add acpi_osi=Linux to the computer bootup kernel options.\nThe bootup kernel options are controlled by the GRUB boot loader. You need to edit the grub settings at /etc/default/grub to have the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet acpi_osi=Linux splash\"\n\nAfter editing the file, you need to make sure you run update-grub for your edit to take effect.\nHopefully this same solution works for you. If it doesn't, you can also try adding the option acpi_backlight=vendor to the same line which was also suggested to me when I tried to get the issue fixed.\n\nA: Some BIOS's are buggy - for example, this bug-report mentions that a recent BIOS revision fixed brightness issues (revision 1202).  Suggest check the vendor website and install the latest available BIOS revision.\nEven with a BIOS update, it is worth checking whether the standard eepc grub options still apply to your model\nTry adding either acpi_osi=Linux source or \nacpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor source\ni.e.\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nadd to the values above to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\nsave \nsudo update-grub\n\nWhat you have described may point to general power-management issues.\nHave you installed the jupiter_0.0.50.2_all.deb package on sourceforge?  More information about this can be found on WebUp8.\n\nA: What do your settings tell you in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/lcd-brightness.conf\n\nThe lcd-brightness module allows you to control the brightness of  your\n         LCD screen.\n\n   CONTROL_BRIGHTNESS\n             When this option is enabled, laptop mode will adjust your LCD\n             screen’s brightness settings, if possible. You must configure\n             the following settings for this to work.\n\n   BATT_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND\n\n   LM_AC_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND\n\n   NOLM_AC_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND\n\n   BRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT\n             The  BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND settings specify commands that should\n             be executed in order to set the brightness of your  LCD.  The\n             BRIGHTNESS_OUTPUT  setting  specifies where the output of the\n             command  will  be  written.  For  instance,  if  your   LCD’s\n             brightness is adjusted by writing a numeric value 3 to a file\n             called /proc/brightness, you should set the command to  \"echo\n             3\"  and  the output file to \"/proc/brightness\".

Problem is that I use Live CD (or is it called Live USB if its USB stick?) to \"discover it\".\nCan I reboot it anyway?\n\nA: What you're talking about doing refers to having a persistent USB Drive. With what you currently are using yes, you can reboot it but no, you won't be able to save anything to it. An option have though is to make a LiveUSB that is able to be persistent, (Able to hold changes and save them, like saving a word document etc.) then you'd most likely be able to do what you're asking. To do this I recommend you use a USB Flash drive that has a minimum of 4GB of free memory, preferably 8GB if you have it. A (hopefully anyway) simple way to do this follows.\nPlease Note: This tutorial is based for those with Windows Systems, and are trying out GNU/Linux on the aforementioned system.\nWhat You Will Need\n\n\n*\n\n*The Universal USB Installer Program.\n\n*A computer with an Internet Connection.\n\n*A GNU/Linux ISO image.

NOTE: If you don't have one you will be given the option to download it before writing it to your chosen drive.\n\n*Browse for and select your chosen USB Flash Drive.\n\n*MAKE SURE you have chosen the right flash/external drive BEFORE you write the ISO image to it as ALL data will be lost when this process is completed!!!\n\n*Write the ISO image to the flash drive, choosing if you wish to have a persistent storage and if so how much memory to allocate for said storage.\n\n*Restart your computer with the flash drive connected, boot to the flash drive, and enjoy your external USB Drive!\nHope this helps you! \n\n\nP.S. If you need more info please do not hesitate to let me know...\n\nA: UNetbootin allows you create LiveUSB for Ubuntu with persistence that allows you to save changes you make to the Live insatallation to the USB for use after reboot (persistence is only available for Ubuntu brand of Linux distributions as far as I'm aware of).\nFeatures:\nUNetbootin can create a bootable Live USB drive, or it can make a \"frugal install\" on your local hard disk if you don't have a USB drive.

I have some source code in an SVN repo which is updated daily.\nIs there a way to push this source package into a PPA that would update from the SVN trunk and build the new packages for me?\nOr do I need my own mechanism for pushing new source packages for every update from trunk?\n\nA: This can easily be done on Launchpad. What you are looking for is called a source package recipe.\nThe way to set this up and get it building the source every day is to first register the project on Launchpad if it isn't already. Once that is complete, go to the project page and click \"configure project branch\":\n\nNow you need to tell Launchpad where the SVN repository is. Click \"Import a branch hosted somewhere else\", select 'SVN', and enter the URL of the SVN branch. Give the branch a name and click update:\n\nNow you have the contents of the SVN repository being imported into Launchpad every so often (usually more than once per day). The next step is to create a source package recipe that builds the package from source every day. There are basically two options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Store the Debian packaging files in the SVN repository - the files should be in a folder called debian.\n\n*Create a separate Launchpad branch that contains the Debian packaging files and have Launchpad merge them together before it builds the package.\n\n\nSince the first option is the easiest, I'd recommend going that route. To set up the daily builds, head to your project's page on Launchpad and click the \"code\" link at the very top. Click on the branch that contains the source code and then click \"create packaging recipe\":\n\nFrom there, simply accept all of the defaults and click \"create recipe\". That's it! Your packages will be built each day (assuming there are new revisions) and placed in the PPA you specified when you created the recipe.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/SourceBuilds/GettingStarted\n\n*Blog post with video\n\n", "Q: How to push branchs for different projects?

Is there an equivalent command for Unity 2D or Gnome that I could run to switch to it? If I am currently running Unity 2D or Gnome, will unity --replace switch me back to Unity?\n\nA: Honestly, I would just log out and log back in. Even if you got a script to switch you mid-session, there could potentially be some Unity code still in RAM that might conflict with whatever session you are in. Also, whenever I switch from logging out / in, the Adwaita theme becomes default for Unity.\nIt would honestly be screwy.

This info can be very hard to find in my experience of searching for it.\n2) reverse engineer the official windows drivers. Im thinking debuggers, decompilers, etc. You need to know how the device communicates to the computer, and this information will be in here. Now obviously you wont be able to implement all that you see in there, given the differences in API of the two platforms, but it will give you an idea of any hardware quirks, and possibly why it doesn't work with standard Linux drivers.\nGood luck, and i hope you succeed :)\n", "Q: openshot and qbittorrent quits after after being launched running: Kubuntu 11.04x64\nBoth programs quit right after being launched and I get the following errors when running each applications from the terminal:\nOpenShot:\n--------------------------------\n   OpenShot (version 1.3.0)\n--------------------------------\nProcess no longer exists: 5485.

Par example:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*firestarter which isn't maintained for 4/5 years. \n  \n*easycrypt which is a gui for truecrypt, while truecrypt comes with\n  a outstanding gui for several years\n  now.\n  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Firestarter bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firestarter/+bug/42759\n\n*easycrypt: https://bugs.launchpad.net/easycrypt/+bug/374113\n\nA: As part of the creation of Ubuntu, a philosophical choice was made to not have a concept of \"maintainer\" for individual software packages.  While there are many benefits to this, one of the side effects is that for a given software package, there is often no individual who has accepted responsibility to maintain a package, with the result that any package which does not attract anyone's interest in a while may become unmaintained (although it is hoped this is a temporary condition).\nUbuntu inherits packages from Debian, except where there has been a deliberate effort to make some change, so any package present in Debian will be present in Ubuntu, barring very unusual circumstances.  As these packages do have someone in Debian who is responsible for making them work in Debian, there is a blanket presumption that they will also work in Ubuntu, which is true for the vast majority of packages, but may not be the case for some specific packages.\nUbuntu also sometimes receives new packages not found in Debian: while it is hoped that whoever decided to contribute the package to Ubuntu will continue to care for it, this is not always the case.\nBoth methods by which apparently unmaintained packages may be present in Ubuntu are essentially the result of neglect, and are mostly waiting for someone to decide to either remove the packages or make them work (with a strong preference for making them work).  Ubuntu is an entirely community-based project, so anyone can do this, although new folk will require a current developer to approve their changes in the beginning.\nFor easycrypt, after confirming that upstream no longer offered support, I have summarised my investigation, and forwarded the bug to the Ubuntu Archive Administrators, who should be removing the package from the current development release soonish, so that it will no longer be presented for future releases of Ubuntu.  A better solution would be also to add a patch to the truecrypt package providing migration support for easycrypt users to use the truecrypt GUI: this needs to be done by someone familiar with the packages.\nFor firestarter, it appears that there was a patch made which was known to work with Ubuntu in the past, but that it was dropped in a later upload (by the patch author).  I don't know enough about firestarter to determine the right solution, but it does appear to be maintained in Debian: someone who uses this tool would need to determine precisely which parts aren't working, and prepare a patch to make them work again, preferably including any required packaging changes to enable immediate upload.\nAnyone preparing either of the patches described above (truecrypt transition for easycrypt users or fixing firestarter) may find https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess useful as a means to ensure their work is included in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Because not developed anymore is not the same as obsolete;\nsome people like to use firestarter still.\n", "Q: How can I get a world clock indicator? I am now running Ubuntu 11.04, but I remember that in previous versions of Ubuntu you had an interesting functionality in the clock indicator. You could see how late it was in some places in the world different from your current one. This was associated with a world map showing where it was day and where it was not.\nHow can I get this functionality back in the clock indicator ? Otherwise, do you advice me another solution to know easily how late it is in some special places ?\n\nA: I am also missing same functionality. However, if you are looking for current time at different places then Time & Date indicator applet could be off your help.\nTo show the current time at different places, follow this procedure.\nClick on Time indicator applet -> Click on Time & Date Settings... -> Click on Clock tab -> Select Time in another location checkbox -> Click on Choose Locations..\nNow enter the name of the place and wait for applet to search it. Once it returns the results, then select the place you want to display.\n\nNow come out, all places you have selected will be visible in your time applet indicator along with their current time.\n\nA: I too missed the display of world daylight (one reason I stuck to Ubuntu 10.04 until now.\nThe good news is that if you update to Ubuntu12.04 and install Maté you not only get rid of Unity, but if you add clock to a panel you get the daylight display back :-)\n\nA: Orage Globaltime\nYou could install Orage Globaltime.

Is it possible to create a Firefox shortcut with username and password stored inside? Even if the cookies got cleared the username and password should remain.\n\nA: WARNING: this method is insecure since bookmarks are not encrypted, which means anyone with access to your machine could login with your credentials if you save bookmarks this way.\nMost web browsers support the following syntax:\n\nprotocol://username:password@www.example.com/direcory\n\nFor example,\n\nhttp://bob:123456@www.example.com/secrets\n\nUsing this syntax will work in a Firefox bookmark (though FF will warn you when you click it)\nNote that this only works for websites that use HTTP password authentication (.htpasswd files in Apache). This won't work, for example, on Facebook.\n\nA: Get Secure Login extension. It allows to store bookmarks with login data (you need to enable that option in the extension preferences). It is secure, because it doesn't store the password or the user in the bookmark url, but just the reference to the Secure Login data, which is retrieved from the password manager and thus can be protected with a Master Password, which is highly recommended btw. \n", "Q: Understanding hexdump '-e' option I'm trying to understand the formatting option of hexdump. I have read the man page and it says that I can tell it what format to output the data in by using the -e option. However, I can not for the life of me understand the code for the option. For now, I'm just trying to have it print random lines from /dev/random like this:\n6568:6C6C:7565:7568:2E62:716D:2E2C:7563\n\n(Basically, a psuedo IPv6 address.) However, I would really like to understand the formatting strings, not just have one that does the trick. I have tried reading the man page and it wasn't much help--it seemed to refer to it being similar to C code. Well, I have almost no experience with C, so I'm stuck. Can somebody please explain this?\n\nA: In the manual page for hexdump, there is an entire section dedicated to the structure of the format strings (search for \"A format string contains any number of format units\").\nTo get the output you are after, the following invocation should do the trick:\nhexdump -e '7 2 \"%04X:\" 1 2 \"%04X\\n\"' input_file\n\nThe format string here has two parts.  The first is repeated 7 times, formatting two bytes at a time formatted with \"%04X:\" (four hexadecimal digits with zero padding, followed by a colon).  The second part is repeated once only and takes two bytes formatted with \"%04X\\n\" to complete the line of output.  This process is then repeated as more data is read from the input file.\n", "Q: Install Intel onboard graphic driver in Asus K53SV?

I know that using picasa I can do the same. But I do not want to use old (non - updated) version of picasa. (plus its 30Mb and requires another 60mb of downloading when installing via ubuntu software center).\nCould you please tell me, how can I sync the photos using shotwell or any other light weight photo viewer/manager.\n\nA: Install digiKam from the software center and run it .\nIf you are running GNOME see this to make it look native .\nNow Press Shift + Ctrl + Alt + P or go to  Import (Menu) -> Import from Picasa Web .\n\n\nA: Check these python works,\nDownload original pictures from the picasaweb\nand a variation,\nDownload original pictures from the picasaweb(only public photos)\nI've not used the first version -- but the second one works fine. \n\nA: Today Shotwell can publish to Web services (a push model), including PicasaWeb.  We have a ticket to allow for two-way synchronization between Web services: http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/2676  No idea when/if this will be ready, but I believe such a feature would solve your problem.\n\nA: Here is a link that shows how to do it with firefox/iceweasel :\nhttp://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/12/download-picasa-web-albums-without.html\n\nA: I had difficulties retrieving albums from my picasa web account. As highlighted in some comments, the download quality with the picasa standalone application is not acceptable. The synchronization option to choose quality is one-way only: upload of albums from the app to the web.\nOne way to retrieve the original quality of the uploaded albums is to use the data archive/retrieval proposed by google: https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout.\nYou can choose Google photos (yep, Google photos is now the centralized codename and you can retrieve your picasa web albums there), and export the desired albums.

Now the problem is that the websites have to enabled and disabled from the terminal. All all of them have to be accessed from http://localhost which is not so much efficient. So I created a VHOSTS, using some tutorials off the net.\nHere is the coding for it\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n    Servername site.com\n    ServerAlias www.site.com\n    DocumentRoot /home/starx/public_html/site/public\n    <Directory />\n        Options FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /home/starx/public_html/site/public>\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride None\n        Order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/\n    <Directory \"/usr/lib/cgi-bin\">\n        AllowOverride None\n        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    </Directory>\nnGen\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/site-error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/site-access.log combined\n\n    Alias /doc/ \"/usr/share/doc/\"\n    <Directory \"/usr/share/doc/\">\n        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride None\n        Order deny,allow\n        Deny from all\n        Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128\n    </Directory>\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNow, still I can't access the page in http://site.com but if i access using http://localhsot/ it is accessed.\nI have disabled all others site including default and have just enabled one site i.e. site\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: I was just trying to get this to work, and after looking around a bit I found out what was going wrong for me.\nI am running xampp (lampp) 1.80 for Ubuntu 12.04.\nopen /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\nSee Line 488\n# Virtual hosts  \n# Include etc/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\nremove the \"#\" from the include.\nA new install does not load the httpd-vhosts.conf out of the box. \n\nA: According to /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz, if you wish to create definitions for additional sites, you will want to place individual site configuration snippets in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ (see /etc/apache2/sites-available/default for an example).  You can then enable and disable sites on a given host with the a2ensite(8) and a2dissite(8) commands.  Note that this may not work precisely as described if the distributed configurations have been changed significantly.\nIf a site is enabled in this way, and continues not to appear to work, you will want to make sure that the web server can resolve the name of the new site in a way that matches an IP address the web server believes it is assigned: the simplest way is probably to check with w3m https://my.new.secure.site from the server.  You also want to verify that the client resolves the name in a way that causes it to reach the server in question (although the resolved IP does not need to match one the server uses).  For insecure sites, this is easiest with telnet my.new.site 80 and, once the connection is complete (there is no prompt), entering the following three lines (note that the third is blank, but you must press enter a third time):\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: my.new.site\n\n\nIf these work, anything else is a browser problem.  If the first succeeds and the second fails, there is probably something odd in the network layer (NAT, proxies, etc.): exactly how to troubleshoot this depends far too much on the network topology and devices present: please ask another question with specifics if this applies to you.\nIf the first test fails, double-check the name service available on the server and the IP addresses assigned to the server (ifconfig -a).  Also check your site access logs to verify that you see a connection at about the right time.  Lastly, make sure that your virtual host is listening by name, rather than by IP, and does not filter the results for / based on IP in your VirtualHost directive.\n\nA: I'm not sure this is what you want.\nReplace your codes with this simple short codes.\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n   ServerAdmin admin@localhost\n   DocumentRoot YourDocumentRoot\n   ServerName site.com\n   ServerAlias www.site.com\n   ErrorLog localhost\n   CustomLog localhost-access_log common\n</VirtualHost>\n\nYou can read more about vhost here\n\nA: Have you added site.com and www.site.com to your /etc/hosts file to make sure that the dns routing is correct?  You can try nslookup site.com to test the dns.\nIf you want to make sure that http://localhost does not work, delete the /etc/apache2/default, default-ssl files and use a single virtualhost.\n", "Q: How to apply patch to rt2x00 driver for Ralink RT5390 support I have a Pavilion dm1, with a known issue with the rt2x00 driver. There is a one line patch that fixes the issue. How do I apply it?\n\nA: The one line patch simply shows you that you would need to edit the rt2800pci.c file from the linux header source files and add,\n#ifdef CONFIG_RT2800PCI_RT53XX\n{ PCI_DEVICE(0x1814, 0x5390) },\n{ PCI_DEVICE(0x1814, 0x539f) },\n#endif\nlines to the file and recompile the header again to get the drivers to work correctly.\n", "Q: Errors shown in terminal when editing files with gedit When editing any file f.e. like this:\nr@ngf:~$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n[sudo] password for r: \n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to store changes into `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Не удалось создать файл «/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.CJP8XV»: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to set the permissions of `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to store changes into `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Не удалось создать файл «/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.W8MHYV»: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to set the permissions of `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to store changes into `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Не удалось создать файл «/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.DZG7XV»: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\n(gedit:1638): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to set the permissions of `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Нет такого файла или каталога\n\nIt is shows some errors, but this doesn't affect on the editing actually -- files     saves normally. So what that errors could mean?\n\nA: First, you shouldn't use sudo with GUI programs. Use gksudo instead.\nAs for the warnings: they are harmless. They just say that gedit tries to save a file at a location that does not exist. If you want to make them go away, you got to create that location:\nsudo mkdir -p /root/.local/share\n\n", "Q: Saturation and contrast settings for wine programs I know that I can change contrast and saturation with nvidia-settings. How can I make different settings for different apps (i.e. wine) using nvidia-settings or any other tool?\n\nA: I believe the option for this is in Compiz, namely brightness and contrast in Accessibility options. To get to it you need the CompizConfig Settings manager.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nThen type ccsm into run or terminal.\nFor individual wine programs, set the process name to the name of the .exe file (case sensitive), for example WINWORD.exe for Microsoft Word, or FL.exe for Fruity Loops.\n", "Q: .php files are downloaded instead of being parsed by Apache I have Xampp on Ubuntu 11.04. .php files are downloaded instead of parsed by Apache!

If  for any reasons we do need to run the vino-server we can only change the display geometry by defining a custom X-Session for this VNC usage or change the geometry live e.g. with randr as described in principle in this answer. \nHowever doing so has some disadvantages that need to be considered:\n\n\n*\n\n*if predifined We are unable to run this custom session when another monitor is connected.\n\n*Other X devices may need to be defined as well.\n\n*changing the geometry for a VNC session remotely cannot easily be done.\n\n*if we break our X settings we may end up with no display\nIf we do need adjustments in screen geometry it would therefore be a better advice to install a VNC-server package other than vino that is capable of changing the geometry.\n\nIf we use vncserver/Xvnc from either tightvncserver , or vnc4server  we may define a virtual XServer geometry by simply adding the option -geometry <width>x<height> when invoking.\nAfter having installed one of the packages above on the remote we start it there by e.g.\nvncserver :1 -geometry 1024x720\n\nIn this example a display with number 1 is created having 1024x720 pixels (after entering a password for the connection).

If I create a folder it gets my user and group, so nobody else can write to it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make folder. \nFor example:  \nmkdir /mnt/family\n\nIf you need mount partition to them... if ext4 all you need in /etc/fstab is  \nUUID=xxx    /mnt/family ext4    **rw,exec,defaults,auto,async   0   2**\n\n\n*Create group myfam.  \naddgroup myfam\n\n\n*Add some users to that group  \nadduser papa myfam  \nadduser mom myfam\n\n\n*Now take and give permission. \nI think you should start, from changing umask.  \nDefault filesystem permissions and access rights in 12.04 \nchown -R you.myfam /mnt/family  \nchmod -R g+rwx /mnt/family  \n\nNow most important. That line create setgid anything you create under that folder have your users as owner and group myfam. That let system override user primary group.  \nchmod -R g+s /mnt/family   \n\n\nA: The simplest thing that come to mind is to add each user to the group of all other users. \nThen change umask of each user from 022 to 002, this could be done in /etc/profile.\nEdit\nThe first step could be replaced with the following: make all users belong to users group as the primary group. \nEdi2\nAs @James_Henstridge suggested, it can be convenient to set the setgid bit on the main directory, so that new files and directories created will have its same group, indipendently of the user. In this way you can avoid the set users as the primary group for users. \n\nA: This sounds like a job for ACLs.  Giles has a very thorough answer on the SE Unix and Linux site that helped me solve the very same issue. \n\nA: Another approach is to use Access Control Lists, a superset of file permissions.\nFirst of all, we have to install the acl  package:\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nBefore Ubuntu 14.04, the partition has to be mounted with the option acl for the following to work. It could be added in /etc/fstab, as in\nUUID=<XXXX>  /media/shared  ext4  noatime,acl  0  2\n\nor for an already mounted filesystem\nsudo mount -o remount,acl /media/shared\n\nNext, you should create a new group, to which all users allowed to access the share in read/write mode will be added. I call it usershare. An already existing group could be used.\nsudo addgroup usershare\n\nNow we add the users enzotib and steevc to that group:\nsudo gpasswd -a steevc  usershare\nsudo gpasswd -a enzotib usershare\n\n(effective at the next login).\nThen we add an ACL with rwx permissions for the group usershare to all files already in /media/shared\nsudo setfacl -Rm g:usershare:rwX /media/shared\n\nFinally we add a default ACL with rwx permissions for the group usershare for all files created from now on inside /media/shared\nsudo setfacl -d -Rm g:usershare:rwX /media/shared\n\nNow all users of the usershare group have full permissions on all files under /media/shared. Permissions of each user on his and other's home directories are not affected.\nI tested this solution and seems to work, but suggestions and corrections are welcome.\nRemark: new files and directories created in the considered directory will have write permission for the usershare group, but files copied or moved in the folder will retain their original permissions. If the user, as I understand, only require write access to newly created directories, this is not a problem. Otherwise it should modify permissions by hand. See this answer on how to overcome this by defining the umask of users to 002.\n\nA: I dont understand, are all linux-linux, linux-windows, linux-???, using Samba?, SSH?, Pigeons?; \nanyways you need to include the others into the Group with your username (your Group), and they will get the same permissions as you.\n\nA: I came across this question while searching for answers for my GROUP PERMISSION problem. I've read the question and It seems I am already implementing what the question tries to accomplish.\nSo I bothered to answer it.\nI have already a setup up of  a share for all users on my lan with read and execute only, and only my account has the permission to write on the shared folders.\nI have a multi-purpose server on my lan that uses ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop Edition. I have a mix client machines of linux and windows.\nHeres how I have set it up:\n1.On my server, I have user accounts named admin and clientone\nThe admin account is the account created when I installed ubuntu and the clientone account is the account created using the USER ACCOUNTS menu in ubuntu. It only has a standard permission, no admin priveleges and it is added to the users group. You may of course do these using only the terminal. Add more additional user accounts for your client machines.\n2.The shared partition/folder is automounted in fstab using only the defaults option.\n3.My network is in a workgroup environment, and It is on mylan workgroup.\nAll machines in my lan is set to use the mylan workgroup.\n4.My shared folder named shared already have files in it. So I change the owner and group for it recursively using the command below.\n sudo chown -Rv admin:users /shared\n\n5.I also set folder and file permission to /shared folder recursively using the command\n sudo chmod -Rv 750 /shared\n\nguest machines in my mylan workgroup does not have access to the share using chmod 750\nyou may use\n sudo chmod -Rv 755 /shared\n\nAll future user accounts within the users group only has read execute permission.\n6.In my client machine one (windows xp) I setup a user account named clientone. The same user name and password as with the one created in my ubuntu server. A second account named clienttwo is also created in ubuntu server and it's the same user account used in my second machine (linuxmint 15).\n7.In my client machine one upon logging in using the clientone account, I go to run command then enter\n //192.168.10.254/shared\n\n192.168.10.254 is the ip address of my ubuntu server, /shared is the folder shared in my ubuntu server In my client machine two (linuxmint 15), I go to Menu > Network and in the Location: dialog bar I typed in:\n smb://192.168.10.254/shared\n\nIf you were prompted for password, enter your user accoun'ts password. And also your keyring password if KEYRING is enable in your linux machines.\nThis one works for me in my own network setup. My server is a multi purpose server serving as squid server, xbmc and mediatomb server and amahi server.\nI am still looking ways on how to improve the file sharing part of my setup. The instruction above is not a bullet proof solution, buy you may try it out.  I test and try the ACL” thing together with auto mounting shared folders. As your folder sharing requirement gets complicated, the above instruction will not guaranty you success.\nAdded Info:\nI have Amahi Server installed in my server, I also used it to create user accounts that I wanted to have access to the shared folders. I also used it to create new folder shares.\nWhen you want more complex user permission for different users, ACL is the one to go.\n\nA: I have video files on my name, but when I sign in with my daughters name her account can't see the video files.

It is available as a package in the archives, and usually performs quite well.

It doesn't show any error messages or such, but files uploaded from the web interface or changed on the newly added computer don't appear/change on the old computer. I guess that it can't connect because it is still using the old password. \nThe problem is that I can't find an interface to change the password the client is using to connect to the service. The \"manage account\" option opens the Web interface. I looked into the keyring, and found the key for Ubuntu One, but there I only see an encrypted version of the password, so I can't change it there. \nSo what is the correct way to tell my client that my account password has changed? \nEdit this is what I see when I open Preferences --> Ubuntu One.

You may get a better power saving by using a 2D only environment - disable all 3D features, including 3D or graphic intensive screensavers - ideally use a blank screen with monitor powersave.\n\nA: This udev rule enables the most aggressive power saving settings.\n/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local-powersave.rules \n# PCI runtime power management\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"pci\", ATTR{power/control}=\"auto\"\n\n# USB autosuspend\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{power/control}=\"auto\"\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", TEST==\"power/autosuspend\" ATTR{power/autosuspend}=\"60\"\n\n# SATA active link power management\nSUBSYSTEM==\"scsi_host\", KERNEL==\"host*\", ATTR{link_power_management_policy}=\"min_power\"\n\n# Wlan power save\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", KERNEL==\"wlan*\" RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/iw dev %k set power_save on\"\n\n# Disable bluetooth\nSUBSYSTEM==\"rfkill\", ATTR{type}==\"bluetooth\", ATTR{state}=\"0\"\n\n# Disable wake-on-LAN\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", KERNEL==\"eth*\" RUN+=\"/usr/sbin/ethtool -s %k wol d\"\n\n", "Q: Problem using mobile broadband and wire network at the same time maybe someone can assist a beginner to solve a problem. I have set up mobile broadband and wired network in the network manager in Ubuntu 11.04. Yet, they won't work at the same time. Wired network seems to have priority and is connected at start up. To get the mobile broadband connection running I have to manually delete the wired network from nm every time. The other way around I can get the wired network running by disabling mobile broadband. I tried to fix things by manually configuring the wired network, but it didn't help.\nNM in Ubuntu seems to see these two connections as two different networks and doesn't accept them running at the same time. In Windows 7 as well as in XP the same combination works without any problems.\nAny idea how to fix this problem? Maybe by handling mobile broadband through wvdial and wired network through NM? This may be a workaround, but I'd prefer to handle both connections through NM.\nAny help is very appreciated.\n\nA: You are right in that they are two separate networks. The way OS's handle this is through prioritising to ensure that one is always used unless unavailable, at which time the OS will use the other one. \nYou can understand why they can't both be used as one network if you try and imagine where packets should route - the TCP/IP stack on a port knows that if it receives a packet for an established session it should match up with one sent out that port earlier. If it can't match it, the only sensible option is to drop the packet.\nYou can use them separately to route, though - so you could set them up so the wired network routes all packets to the Internet and the wireless one routes all packets to local machines - but the destination networks must be exclusive to each other.\nWired networks almost always get highest priority, as they are usually fastest and most reliable - and it sounds like your system is working correctly.\n\nA: Ubuntu Network Manager might not be a good choice for you. Because it wont handle multiple networks at the same time. Try other network managers instead. Like WCID http://www.wicd.net/  this network manager is more powerful than the Ubuntu Network Manager. But it became a quite a big hassle for me to install it. It should be worth the try for you.

The only thing that works are the analog outputs.\nBut in order to enjoy movies with DD 5.1 or DTS I need the optical out to function. Another problem is that my old Yamaha receiver doesn't handle DTS directly, so I need either Dolby Digital Live to transform it or ffdshow audio codecs (throughput to spdif only results in noise). And third, I am addicted to DDL to enjoy stereo sources in surround sound. DDL works much better than Dolby Prologic II.\nAny idea how to get this working in Natty? At least I need to get the optical out working (though Dolby Digital Live is also very desirable). I tried to set things in alsa mixer but without results. Coming from the Windows side and being new to Ubuntu I really have a hard time to get things working the way I was used to. Is there at least some similar codec pack like ffdshow that I could use in Ubuntu?\nAny help would be very appreciated.\n\nA: Lets see what your system sees your Sound card as! Type in Terminal  lspci -v | less  This will check your computer's motherboard, and attempt to list out all devices that it's recognized as installed. There is probably a lot of things listed, but the one you're looking for will be labeled Audio device. \nMost users have a \"built in\" sound card for their computer on the motherboard. If yours is built in, and isn't showing up in this step, then you probably need to enable it in your BIOS. When you first boot, or reboot your computer, there's usually a key sequence telling you how to enter the BIOS Configuration Screen. You'll need to sort through your BIOS and enable the built in sound card.\nIf you are not using a built in sound card, and this step does not show your audio card, the card may be seated incorrectly on your motherboard, or may be bad or otherwise incompatible with your motherboard. You will probably want to test the card in another computer to see if it works there.\n", "Q: \"allrequestsallowed.com\"... Hack attempt? I have many attempts on my (small, personal and absolutely unimportant) web server, and apache and fail2ban usually do their job right. But there's a log entry that worries me:\nxx.yy.www.zzz - - [9/Jul/2011:12:42:15 +0100] \"GET http://allrequestsallowed.com/?PHPSESSID=5gh6ncjh00043YVMWTW_B%5CFAP HTTP/1.1\" 200 432 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12\"\n\nThe problem is answer wasn't a 404 code, but a 200 instead. Is that okay? Seems weird to me, but my knowledge on this field (and many others) is, to put it softly, limited.\n\nA: First, up front, I don't know what the presumed attacker is trying to accomplish. Maybe there's a PHP script or PHP version out there vulnerable to some strange session ID attack, I dunno. You probably have nothing to worry about, though.\nYour server behaved exactly as expected. 200 is the expected code in that particular situation because of how Apache interprets the URL being passed to it.\nFirst, http://allrequestsallowed.com is treated like the more usual 'Host:' header (note that I don't think this is specified in the RFC and other servers may not interpret it this way I was wrong, this is specified in RFC 2616 in section 5.1.2, even though clients rarely seem to use that form. Excuse me, I need to go fix an HTTP server implementation I wrote a while back...).\nNow, presumably you don't have a site named 'allrequestsallowed.com'. So what happens when Apache gets a Host: header (or equivalent) for a hostname it doesn't recognize? It picks the first virtual host as the default. This is well-defined and documented behavior for Apache. So whatever your first virtual host is (or just the main server configuration if there aren't any vhosts) takes over, no matter what it's named.\nNow, the rest of the URL given consists of two parts -- the path, /, and a GET parameter (the ?PHPSESSID... bit).\nNow, the path / should be present on pretty much every web server out there. In most cases, it maps to something like index.html or perhaps an index.php script, though you can override any of this of course.\nIf it maps to a static HTML file, absolutely nothing unusual happens -- the contents of the file are returned, and that's that, the parameter is simply ignored. (Assuming you don't have certain advanced configuration directives set, and you almost certainly don't.)\nOn the other hand, if it's a script of some sort, that PHPSESSID variable will get passed to the script. If the script actually uses that variable (in this particular case, only PHP scripts using PHP's built-in session handling are likely to), its behavior will depend on the contents.\nIn all likelihood, however, even if your / happens to map to a PHP script using sessions, nothing remarkable will happen. The session ID probably won't exist anyway, and will either be ignored, or the script will show an error.\nIn the unlikely case that the session ID does exist, well, the attacker could conceivably hijack someone else's session. That would be bad, but it's not really a security hole in itself -- the hole would be wherever the attacker got the session ID information from (sniffing a wireless network is a good candidate if you're not using HTTPS). They wouldn't actually be able to do anything that the user whose session it originally was couldn't do.\nEdit: Additionally, the '%5C' inside the SESSIONID maps to a backslash character. This seems to be a test for directory traversal attacks on windows hosts.\n\nA: I've got this allrequestsallowed logged on an ip that's used as A record for all our parking-domains.\nMy shot is that this hostname is used in combination with the \"attacker's\" local hostfile pointing to the target host.\nThe actual webserver at 31.44.184.250 is just to handle external requests.\nMy opinion: total harmless.  Don't see any value added use for it except for stuff you can do with any other fake domain name in your hostfile.\n", "Q: Is Wayland coming to Ubuntu Oneric?

Here is how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/resolve.conf to set your domain name resolution to your local machine by commenting out any existing lines and adding nameserver 127.0.0.1. After this line add another line containing a secondary dns server for resolving other sites, eg nameserver 8.8.8.8.

This is how I fixed it though:\nI finally fixed the issue, although it may not be the best solution.  Keep in mind the FTP service is not accessible to the outside Internet.\nSo Wordpress tries to use FTP to create the directories and files needed for the upgrade.  It does this when uploading plugins or themes as well.  Because I also couldn't create a directory over FTP, I decided to try the following in the vsftpd config:\nanon_upload_enable=YES\nanon_mkdir_write_enable=YES\n\nI restarted the server and everything worked.  Now, I assume that this can be a security issue of some sort, but the anon account is disabled (anonymous_enable=NO).\nAlso, as an aside and a response to both the other suggestions about directory permissions, here is what I tried permissions-wise on the server.\n\n\n*\n\n*All wordpress directories 775\n\n*All wordpress files 664\n\n*Owner: my user, Group: users\n\n*www-data user added to the users group (just a test, did not work obviously)\n\n\nSo I think www-data had write access to the necessary directories, but it still did not work. That's why I started exploring the FTP server issues.\nI welcome any comments on this.\n\nA: This document may help you understanding how permissions should be applied for your files/folders in order to Wordpress work without a hassle.\nIn my personal experience, giving 755 permissions to the WordPress folder does the trick, but certain folders will require to have 777 no matters what WordPress says, several plugins and/or updates (even to the WP core) won't work if those folders doesn't feature 777 permissions.\nQuoted from the document that I mention in the top of this answer:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*All files should be owned by the actual user's account, not the user\n  account used for the httpd process.\n  \n*Group ownership is irrelevant, unless there's specific group\n  requirements for the web-server process permissions checking. This\n  is not usually the case.\n  \n*All directories should be 755 or 750.\n  \n*All files should be 644 or 640. Exception: wp-config.php should be\n  600 to prevent other users on the server from reading it.\n  \n*No directories should ever be given 777, even upload directories.\n  Since the php process is running as the owner of the files, it gets\n  the owners permissions and can write to even a 755 directory.\n\nThis answer: General Rules for dealing with File Permissions will be helpful for a better comprehension on the permissions in a Ubuntu based system. Which -in case to be a local server- won't need to be accessed through a FTP Client in order to perform the task, but using a terminal.\nIf you need further information about this, feel free to drop a comment. My WP Blog can be reached via http://geppettvs.x10.mx/blog and I faced this issue lots of times in the past for remote and local servers. \nGlossary for my answer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Local Server should be considered a computer that I can plug with a keyboard or mouse in order to interact directly with its OS.\n\n*Remote Server is a computer that is not physically in front of me and I can't plug a keyboard or mouse to it in order to work with\nthe computer's OS.\n\n\nA: chown -R ftpuser.ftpuser /var/www/yourwebsite/wp-content/upgrade/\n\nchmod 755 /var/www/yourwebsite/wp-content/upgrade/\n\n\nA: Did you try changing the Owner and Group of the directory.

Also, it may not work because you're using Wubi and not a direct-to-drive installation.\n\nA: It should be possible using photorec...\ne.g. on my wubi install I did the following:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\nsudo photorec /dev/loop0\n[proceed]\n[none] (partition type table)\nP ext4 [search]\n[ext2/ext3]\n[free] (or I guess you could use [whole])\n\nThen select some place to recover other than the wubi install (I assume you'd run this from a live CD, so select the local hard drive... I used /host/ubuntu )\nThen hit Y to select and it runs.\nThen check results. Here's some terminal output\nbcbc@ubuntu:~$ sudo photorec /dev/loop0\nPhotoRec 6.11, Data Recovery Utility, April 2009\nChristophe GRENIER <grenier@cgsecurity.org>\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org\nPhotoRec exited normally.\nbcbc@ubuntu:~$ ls /host/ubuntu\ndisks    recup_dir.1  recup_dir.3  recup_dir.5      Ubuntu.ico          winboot\ninstall  recup_dir.2  recup_dir.4  tedwireless.txt  uninstall-wubi.exe\nbcbc@ubuntu:~$ cd /host/ubuntu/recup_dir.1/\nbcbc@ubuntu:/host/ubuntu/recup_dir.1$ ls\nf0270448.txt  f1666616.txt  f1668496.txt  f1791600.txt  f2403160.txt\nf0270472.txt  f1666624.txt  f1668528.txt  f1791608.txt  f2403176.txt\nf0270488.txt  f1666632.txt  f1668560.txt  f1791616.txt  f2403208.txt\n...\n\nIf you're running from a live cd, first mount your windows host and then the root.disk:\nsudo mkdir -p /media/win\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/win #change /dev/sda1 for your own partition\nsudo mount -o loop /media/win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /mnt\n\nThen you can proceed selecting the appropriate loop device.\n\nA: There are two main approaches to recovering data. The first is file carving which attempts to identify the start and end of files and extract them.\nThis is very good for certain types of files, but you lose the file names and file times. It is particularly good for jpeg images.\nThe second approach depends very much on the file system. You are probably using ext3 or ext4.\nIf you are using ext3, then sleuthkit should work. However, I believe that sleuthkit doesn't yet handle ext4.\nIf your file system is ext3, try:\nsudo apt-get install sleuthkit\n\nand run\nfls -r <device name of your home directory>\n\ne.g.\nfls -r /dev/sda1\n\n(I haven't used WUBI so I don't know where your home partition might be.)\nThis will show you the file names which may be recoverable. If they are recoverable, then icat can be used to recover them.\n\nA: May be you can try my tool - http://freshmeat.net/projects/extcarve\n\"extcarve is a ext2/ext3/ext4 file recovery and semantic file carving tool. It can recover a range of file formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, PDF, C/C++ programs, PHP, and HTML\"\n", "Q: How can I get a Spyder 2 colorimeter working?

Upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot.\nThe combination of the new kernel (3.0) and new version of ArgyllCMS (1.3.3 instead of 1.0.x) has made the Spyder 2 work again on my hardware. You can get fix this in 11.04 by using a 3.0 kernel and using the latest version of ArgyllCMS which you have to compile yourself, but it's just so much easier to install Oneiric.\nI don't know what changed in the Linux kernel or ArgyllCMS, but I'm glad to report that this has now been fixed and my photos now look beautiful on my monitor :)\n", "Q: Maximize windows to physical screen when using a virtual resolution w/xrandr I have a netbook with a small screen in widescreen format (1024x600), which means that a lot of programs whose designers didn't imagine such a thing open windows that can't be resized and whose bottoms are obscured.  Through Ubuntu 10.04, I took care of it with an xrandr command:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --fb 1024x768 --panning 0x768\n\n(note the 0x) which had the effect of giving me a normal-sized virtual desktop that panned vertically, but which (somehow) the window manager ignored, so maximized windows only occupied the physical screen.  The result was that I didn't have to pan unless a large dialog box popped up: nice.\nIn 11.04, this doesn't quite work.  Everything I said above is true, but the bottom 168 pixels seem permanently blackened, so that if a large window extends down there I can't see what's in it (however, it is there: the resize handles appear, and are useful on those occasions that resizing is allowed).  I imagine this is Unity-related.  That defeats the purpose, so I'm trying this xrandr command:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --fb 1024x768 --panning 1024x768\n\n(note the 1024x).  Alas, it does not trick the window manager anymore, and maximized windows all go off the bottom.  Question:\n\nHow do I set things up so that a \"maximized\" window takes up only the physical screen (or more generally, takes up a particular piece of screen)?\n\nA related question I'd be happy to have answered instead is:\n\nWhy does the first xrandr command fool the window manager (the \"0x\" means, according to the man page, that panning along the horizontal axis is disabled; functionally, this is meaningless since the virtual size is the same as the physical size)?  What goes wrong with Unity?\n\nNote that the \"maximize\" action is necessary, since in Unity, a maximized window is styled differently: its titlebar is absorbed into the toolbar at the top of the screen, saving valuable pixels for me.  Simply resizing a window is not a good alternative.\nReferences:\nI found this question: I'd like to prevent maximize from covering one third of the screen.  I was very disappointed when Compiz Maximumize appeared to do nothing at all (there's a Launchpad bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz-fusion-plugins-extra/+bug/462158).\nI also found the same question on superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/269966/id-like-to-prevent-maximize-from-covering-one-third-of-the-screen, which offers two alternatives.  The Compiz Grid plugin doesn't help because it doesn't maximize, as I described above.  I have not tried the Python window organizer, but it looks similar to Grid.  In general I don't expect that clever scripts will help, because the meaning of \"maximize\" is controlled by the window manager itself, and so the solution should be a Compiz solution.  Is there one?\n\nA: Let me answer my own question; the answer is bizarrely involved.  The trick is that the desired desktop behavior (which held in 10.04) is now (in 11.04) controlled by Compiz, which has a notion of \"outputs\": that is, screens to draw on.  These are configured in the CompizConfig Settings Manager (package compizconfig-backend-gconf or -kconfig), in the \"general options\" menu, under the \"Display Settings\" tab.\nThis thing has three settings, all of which are important.  The most important is \"Detect outputs\": that must be unchecked, because the whole point is that I want to create an unphysical screen setup, whereas autodetection will just pick up the size of my screen.\nThe second most important is the \"Outputs\" box, which is a list of resolutions.  At first glance you may expect that the thing to put in here is \"1024x768\", but that's wrong: it tells Compiz to use the whole virtual screen, so maximized windows will flow into the bottom; that's the wrong behavior.  But writing \"1024x600\" doesn't work either, since that will tell Compiz to pretend that the screen is only 600 pixels high; the counterintuitive result is therefore it decides to stretch every window.  This is ugly and also nonfunctional, causing amazing graphical glitches and, mysteriously, displacing buttons from the place you need to click to activate them.  Not good.\nA much better option is to write \"1024x600+0-168\", which tells Compiz that there are actually 168 unused pixels on the bottom: that reproduces the \"black bar\" behavior I was complaining about.  It's good to know where that comes from, but I still don't want it.  But it tells me what it means: it means that Compiz is simply ignoring those pixels: it won't draw windows there.  My mouse still goes there, though, because that behavior is controlled by X, which comes before Compiz.  It seems that the thing to do is somehow tell Compiz to draw there (so windows can go there) but also not to draw there (so they don't want to go there).\nThe totally correct solution is therefore to describe two output devices to Compiz: one \"1024x600+0-168\", and one \"1024x768\", thus telling Compiz to draw and not draw on those bottom pixels, at the same time.  But how to make sure it knows which one to \"want\"?  That's the first option in this tab: \"Overlapping Output Handler\".  Set it to \"Prefer smaller output\", which is exactly what I said in words up there.\nSo the answer: run xrandr --mode 1024x700 --fb 1024x768 --panning 0x768; go to Compiz' display options and put in two outputs \"1024x600+0-168\" and \"1024x768\"; uncheck \"Detect Outputs\"; and make \"Overlapping Output Handler\" prefer smaller outputs.  Whew.\n\nA: This xrandr thing is very fun and useful. Thanks for sharing that info! Panning does work! I'm on a lubuntu based distro. But there's another easier solution found here http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=110&t=146674 \nBasically, for windows that are too large for netbooks like ours (mine is also 1024x600) Simply press alt+left click a window and drag it to any direction you want. This way, we can see the bottom pixels easily.\n", "Q: Why do my (youtube) videos play for two seconds, then stop? Lately (a week or so) I have this incredibly annoying bug: Every once in a while I get to the point were youtube and other .flv-videos play for two seconds and then stop. If I press start and stop or skip to another position in the video, I get another two seconds. *Restarting gnome helps it for a while, resta*rting firefox/totem doesn't help.\nI did not change a thing in my video or flash-player options. The problems occurres in totem as well. VLC is fine.\nEdit:\nGnash seems to help the problem but creates others: With Gnash there are a few webplayers that simply don't work anymore. The 64bit-nonfree has the same problems as the 32bit-nonfree (2 seconds then stop). The problem is independent of gpu validation. Clearing cache and cookies makes no difference. Only restarting gnome helps.\nEdit2:\nHere is some info on my system.

For some weird reason I could do it in youtube fullscreen only and it didn't work until the on the second right-click attempt. \nFlash is only feeling blue\nIf you have the bluish video bug only, i.e. without the stopping video issue then take a look at this answer: Flash video appears blue.\n\n", "Q: Why does grub store multiple kernels? Is there some sort of best practice around removing them (when/how/why)? What is the point of keeping them around in the first place and why would you even put them in grub?\nI guess there is not a \"problem\" per say, but I am just curious about that design decision.\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but you can still use the old kernels with the new user interface right?\n\nA: According to The Evil Phoenix and sladen, I want to add:\nIf you used a kernel real long, and now you get a new one, and start using it successfully, you can delete the ones before the long-used 2nd newest one. Keep the current and the kernel before, except you have problems. \nIf you have problems, you will know yourself which kernel to keep and why. You might have multiple kernels, because one is able to produce high speed 3d graphics, but then acpi fails so you can't hibernate, and the other one does hibernate, but the 3d-performance is low. \nBut you can collect them, until the grub-screen is filled too much, and delete a couple of them at once. \n\nA: Yes, in most cases.  Old kernels are there in case something breaks with a new one.  This way, you can use the old kernel which works and just remove the new kernel which doesnt work.\n\nA: A couple of follow ons.\n1) if you've just upgraded to a new version of ubuntu then it definitely makes sense to remove the old kernels because they may not work properly with the new version\n2) you can remove the old images by running synamptic (or apt-get) and removing the older linux-image* entries (and if you remove the linux-image* you should also remove the linux-header* of the same version number if they are present) \n\nA: The short answer is they are used \"as a backup\".  New kernels are tested on a large amount of hardware before being released, but can't be tested on everything.  If an update causes the machine to not boot successfully, then the previous known-good kernel is available as a fallback.\n", "Q: /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs eats up 68% of my disk space On a device with 2GB storage every MB is counted.\nI wonder what is this /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs doing on my system and is there a way to avoid its existence. \nNote this mount point eats up 1.2 GB\n# df -h\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1             1.8G  1.2G  546M  68% /\nnone                  995M  224K  995M   1% /dev\nnone                 1000M     0 1000M   0% /dev/shm\nnone                 1000M  136K 1000M   1% /var/run\nnone                 1000M     0 1000M   0% /var/lock\nnone                 1000M     0 1000M   0% /lib/init/rw\nnone                  1.8G  1.2G  546M  68% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs\n\n\n# cat /proc/self/mountinfo\n15 19 0:0 / /sys rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime - sysfs none rw\n16 19 0:3 / /proc rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime - proc none rw\n17 19 0:5 / /dev rw,relatime - devtmpfs none rw,size=1018860k,nr_inodes=254715,mode=755\n18 17 0:12 / /dev/pts rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime - devpts none rw,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000\n19 1 8:1 / / rw,relatime - ext4 /dev/disk/by-uuid/68bf9687-2dec-49fd-a37d-5532c19f3a39 rw,errors=remount-ro,barrier=1,data=ordered\n21 15 0:15 / /sys/fs/fuse/connections rw,relatime - fusectl none rw\n22 15 0:7 / /sys/kernel/debug rw,relatime - debugfs none rw\n23 15 0:10 / /sys/kernel/security rw,relatime - securityfs none rw\n24 17 0:16 / /dev/shm rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime - tmpfs none rw\n25 19 0:17 / /var/run rw,nosuid,relatime - tmpfs none rw,mode=755\n26 19 0:18 / /var/lock rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime - tmpfs none rw\n27 19 0:19 / /lib/init/rw rw,nosuid,relatime - tmpfs none rw,mode=755\n\n# du -a /var | sort -n -r | head -n 10\n138576  /var\n87496   /var/lib\n61164   /var/lib/apt\n61120   /var/lib/apt/lists\n34120   /var/cache\n30668   /var/cache/apt\n26108   /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_lucid_universe_binary-amd64_Packages\n18996   /var/lib/dpkg\n16952   /var/lib/dpkg/info\n15320   /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin\n\n\nA: It looks like df is a bit confused here rather than there being an actual problem.\nAccording to your mountinfo, there is no file system mounted under /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs, and its df statistics are identical to those for /.

As for the hardware, there is a list of cameras that work with ZoneMinder that you can choose some hardware from. Choose something that has the features you require (network camera, certain resolution, low light, etc) from that list and it should work with ZoneMinder. \n\nA: As far as I know, the majority of the IP cameras, as those shown in this virtual shop, starting from $ 945.00 Mexican Pesos (almost 100 US Dollars), and this D-Link DC-900 (the majority of them tested by me) resolves the motion detection, scheduled recording and remote control by itself (there are just a few which features 360° movement, remote controlled).\nWhat I mean: All that you need is a good FTP Server where to drop the images/videos, which can also be Linux Based.\nHow to reach your cameras from outside is as easy as getting a Dynamic Domain Name Service and to use it in your modem/router or, if you have fixed IP then you don't have a problem, you will also be in need to route the specific ports to the cameras and make the cameras respond to the petitions of a specific port.\nEverything can be monitored/controlled via web browser, like in this example of my security system which is embedding 3 cameras (1 of them remote controlled) in a single web page. (blurred where needed for privacy).\n\nThe remote controlled camera is the one shown here, with two-way audio (yes, you can speak to people close to the camera), wireless and infra-red night vision. (Sorry, I don't sell these cameras but I purchased over there in Mexico City.)\nSo, I would suggest you to look for a specific camera that fits your needs and if your intentions are to keep a backup of your videos in a server, look for FTP server guides here or even in the net.\nGood luck!\nEdit:\nOriginal DCS-900 Camera's Web Based Application\n\n\nA: ZoneMinder seems to be a complex piece of software ...

In particular, you'll probably want to run zmu -d /dev/video0 --verbose -V1 --query (or with -V2) to list the supported modes of your camera. Sometimes, the Linux driver doesn't support as many modes as the Windows driver.\n\n*Set a higher shared memory limit [ link ]. For Ubuntu, you want to run echo kernel.shmmax = 536870912 > /etc/sysctl.d/60-kernel-shm.conf, then sysctl -p to set the maximum shared memory size to 512MB.\n\n*Restart zoneminder (service zoneminder restart).\n\n*tail -f /var/log/syslog and watch for errors; google them and reconfigure your camera until it works :)\n\n\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: How do I control the upload/download bandwidth per user?

I have installed VirtualBox OSE on Ubuntu 11.04 and Windows XP pro as the virtual machine.\nNow I want to have a shared folder which can be accessed on both, my host Ubuntu machine, and my WinXP guest virtual machine.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You have to install the Virtualbox Guest Addition (GA) to be able to share with the host if using Windows.\nFirst create a folder to share in with the host. For example, create a  folder called X in your Host's Desktop and before or after installing the Guest Addition right click on the guest os in your Virtualbox main window. Go to settings and look for the Shared Folder option.\nSelect it and choose the X folder you just made. Now boot the guest OS with the Guest Addition already installed (if you haven't installed it yet do so) and on the terminal type net use x: \\\\vboxsrv\\x that is all. It should tell you that you are now sharing.\nFor Linux is easier.\n\nA: First step is to install Guest Additions in your virtual Windows.\nAfter that you may define a shared folder as outlined in this answer. However in Windows you don't \"mount\" it but instead you take the following steps (from the user manual of Virtual Box):\n\nIn a Windows guest, shared folders are browseable and therefore visible in Windows Explorer. So, to attach the host's shared folder to your Windows guest, open Windows Explorer and look for it under \"My Networking Places\" -> \"Entire Network\" -> \"VirtualBox Shared Folders\". By right-clicking on a shared folder and selecting \"Map network drive\" from the menu that pops up, you can assign a drive letter to that shared folder.\n\nIf you don't see any entries coming up in the Browse dialog, you can manually fill out the Folder: field with \\\\VBOXSVR\\<folder-name> where <folder-name> is the share name of your folder.\n\nScreenshots for Windows Explorer (German locale)\nWindows XP\n\nWindows 7\n\nWindows 10\n\n\nA: I was having this problem with Ubuntu host and Windows Guest. I had Guest addition installed but was not able to share the folder.\nFollowing 3 commands in Ubuntu host terminal worked for me\nsudo apt install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\nsudo apt install build-essential module-assistant\nsudo m-a prepare\n\nAfter that start Guest Machine and install Virtual Box Guest Addition from\n Devices - Insert Guest Additions CD image , this will show the ISO file just go on clicking to install.\nIf ISO is not listed then again click Devices-Optical Drives-Choose Disk Image\nbrowse to \"/usr/share/virtualbox\" ISO image should be here select this and then go back to installation process.\n\nA: Adapted from here.\nAt least for Ubuntu 22.04 host system and Windows 10 Pro and VirtualBox 6.1.38, the following works. I assume, it works the same way with other versions of Windows as guest:\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Guest operating system in VirtualBox.\n\n*Select Devices > Shared Folders in the VirtualBox menu\n\n*Choose the Add button. Select the host folder you want to share\n\n*Select Auto Mount\n\n*Reboot your guest system\n\n*Now you will find your shared folder mapped as network drive on Windows.\n\n", "Q: Klipper icon on top panel isn't functioning When clicking on the klipper icon on the unity bar nothing happens.

My problem is that touchscreen is working, but calibration is horribly off - I'm able to navigate only a small portion of upper-left corner (while I'm pressing all over the screen). And my xorg.conf file does not even have an entry for this device.\nWhat can you recommend me to do to configure it?\n\nA: Found the solution\nI was able to successfully calibrate my screen using the following method:\nOpen a terminal and type the following:\nxinput list\n\nYou should see something like this:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                     id=2 [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer               id=4 [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ IDEACOM  IDC 6680                        id=8 [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ IDEACOM  IDC 6680                        id=9 [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad               id=13 [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                    id=3 [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard              id=5 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                             id=6 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                             id=7 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ USB 2.0 Camera                           id=10 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Asus EeePC extra buttons                 id=11 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard             id=12 [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nNote where it has the first \"IDEACOM  IDC 6680\", that's your touchscreen.

You may need to tweak these numbers for your monitor, so just fiddle with the values and rerun the command  until you are happy with the calibration.\nAt the moment you will lose your calibration when you reboot so to make it permanent do the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/98x11-common_touchscreen\n\nPaste you calibration command from the step above into the file and save.\n", "Q: Ubuntu/Kubuntu LTS: longer support for server packages I read that Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop is supported till April 2013, but Server is supported till April 2015.\nIf I install Ubuntu LTS Desktop, will the server packages of the system still be updated until April 2015? I don't care about security updates to the desktop parts (the GUI for the server I'm setting up is rarely used, and not for anything dangerous like email and web browsing), but I do care about the server parts (like SSH, etc.).\nAnd if so, would the same hold true for Kubuntu? The LTS announcement naturally does not mention the longer server support window (seeing as to how it is a desktop distribution), but I wonder if the server packages will still get updates till 2015?\n\nA: Yes, the server packages are what continues to receive updates.  How those packages got installed doesn't matter.  Note that if you want the kde desktop on a server, you might be better off installing the server edition, and then adding the kubuntu-desktop task instead of installing kubuntu, and then adding server packages.\n\nA: From 12.04 onwards both the server and desktop versions get the same support lifetime:\n\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support. There is no extra fee for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms.

For example:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName[en_EN]=all2pdf\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"IFS=$'\\n'; args=(`( for f in %U; do echo $f; done ) | sort`); dir=(`dirname $args`); convert ${args[@]} $dir/convert.pdf \"\n\nPutting this code in a file \"all2pdf.desktop\" and making this file executable by\nchmod u+x all2pdf.desktop\n\nallows to drag some files on the icon named \"all2pdf\" and converting them into one single PDF file using \"convert\".\nThe example command is lengthy, but is also contains a remedy for the list of files always being in reverse order (regardless of the selection order of the files that are dragged).\nI have just used the above method (i.e. the file) to create a number of PDF files with few pages each from a bigger set of single pictures that I created using \"Scan Tailor\".

After that, when the application is uninstalled, they icons are automatically removed from the desktop.\n\nA: As already mentioned, this isn't something that should be done for an official package. Though I could see how this might be useful in a local deployment.\nUse something like this in debian/postinst:\n#!/bin/sh\nfor user in /home/*\ndo\n    cp /usr/share/applications/foo.desktop ${user}/Desktop/\n    chmod 755 ${user}//Desktop/foo.desktop\ndone\n\n\nA: From design of Unity the desktop is not the place of first choice where applications icons are meant to be (of course you can easily put them there if your workflow needs this).\nHaving said so, it is therefore reasonable that newly installed applications are put on the launcher rather than on the desktop. By installing from the Software Center you need to press More Info rater than Install\n\nto find a button Add to Launcher on the lower right:\n\nSelect this option to put the application's icon on the launcher after a successful installation:\n\n\nA: As a previous poster had suggested, it's bad form to touch things in /home/USER during installation. As mentioned there isn't a Global Desktop that you can add it to, so what happens if there are multiple users on the system? Or a user is added after installation?\nThat said, I believe you could do it in postinst by copying the .desktop file to the /home//Desktop/ folder. You would also want to have a prerm (or perhaps postrm) to remove the file during uninstallation. Verify the file is there before removing in case the user deleted the desktop icon (Also, what happens if a different user uninstalls it?). At this point, this is getting pretty messy.\nTechnically speaking, that should work. I'm just not sure if you would be able to get that past REVU to be included in the official Ubuntu repositories. \n", "Q: Mercurial central repository at a Samba location I have a remote Samba location mounted as /mnt/rua as discussed here.

Is it true that each app is designed for its own desktop environment (like GNOME, XFCE, LXDE, etc.)? If I try to use an app that's made for a different desktop than I'm using (like using a GNOME app in LXDE), will it break/look ugly or something? I don't get it...\n\nA: No. Well generally the answer is 'no'.\nA program depends (for instance) on libraries and those libraries get installed with the program. And since those libraries are unique for the desktop environment (DE) they are intended for they will most likely not break the DE you install it on since the maker of said software will try to create unique file names or use general libraries and use general toolkits (and those should be unique too). \nIf by accident the creator of the program creates something that has the same name and is also saved into the same directory as the software on the DE you want to install it it will get tricky. Sometimes the installer will warn you and quit. \nI have seen 1 time where this happend but that was because a piece of software was forked and the person forking it decided to keep names identical instead of actually making it into a new independent program. But you are likely to then choose one over the other so it was basically a non existing problem.\nI remember another one: on SCO you have a command called enable that has 2 functions: it is part of a printer setup where you disable and enable a printer. But it also a function for something else (and this one comes first). So you can do disable /dev/kyo0 but need to do /usr/bin/enable /dev/kyo0 to enable the printer (this was later fixed by renaming enable to cups-enable) (from memory so specifics might be off ;) ).\nBut this is just annoying and was not a big problem: since both reside in different directories the command further up the PATH directive needs to have the directory in front of it).   \n\nA: You really only need to worry about KDE in terms of apps from different desktop environments, and even then, you only need to worry just a little bit. As for Xfce, LXDE, and GNOME, all three of those use the Gimp toolkit (Gtk), so they should function and look properly between each other.\nYes, it might look a bit uglier, but functionality should be retained.\n\nA: They might look a bit ugly in some cases, but the functionality will almost always work.\n", "Q: Are Linksys wireless adapters well suppored on Ubuntu? Ever since Ubuntu 8.10 when I first started I couldn't get my old Linksys WUSB54G wireless card to work. At least in 11.04 it somewhat works only when you set a static IP, and even then speeds are pitiful (The ping time to my router is 10ms(!), DNS takes a while, and bittorrent is painful). Yesterday I bought a Linksys WUSB100 only to have the same problems.\nWith these two devices not working, do Linksys wireless cards or the Ralink modules that power them in general work well in Ubuntu? Or is this pretty much the standard experience?\nNote: I know I can use ndiswrapper but at least with the WUSB54G its very flaky and causes lots of kernel panics in both Ubuntu and Fedora. Its also a workaround that I'd prefer not to rely on\nNote 2: I'm asking this since I'm returning the WUSB100 I just bought and needing to know if I can use Linksys products in Linux\n\nA: The Ralink drivers can be downloaded from Ralink's site (http://www.ralinktech.com/support.php?s=2), and you'll need to know which Ralink chipset is used in the adapter (and it sounds like you do), but they need a bit of work to get them working.

Have tried asking 3rd party about key differences between Juju and Puppet/Chef. 3rd parties are not too familiar with Juju and could not say. They simply stated the others have a lot of momentum, and it would be hard to overcome their lead.\nWould those closest to Juju be willing to highlight the advantages of this software, and why it will overtake Puppet/Chef in the config management arena?\n\nA: Mark, this is a great question, and was the first one I asked when somebody told me about Juju. Here's some of the big differences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Juju encapsulates services - a charm defines all the ways the service needs to expose or consume config data to/from other services. How a charm does that is the charm's business. It can use any tool from shell scripts to Chef in solo mode, to do that.\n\n*Juju orchestrates provisioning - juju keeps track of the resources it has available to it, and can add or remove them as needed. Currently these resources are AWS EC2 machines, OpenStack clouds (like HP Cloud), Microsoft Azure, Joyent, bare metal machines via MAAS, and an LXC/KVM local provider.\n\n*Juju makes sharing easy - anyone can contribute a charm to the Juju Charm Store; these charms are vetted and peer reviewed by the Juju community.\nHere are some other comparisons people have made from across the web:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20140404014848/https://community.csc.com/community/cio-engage/blog/2013/08/25/beyond-chef-and-puppet-ubuntu-juju\n\n*How does Juju \"co-exist\" with Chef, taking the automation process \"one step further\"?\n\nA: (Disclaimer - I'm the founder of Puppet and CEO of Puppet Labs)\nI don't know juju terribly well, but from what I can tell, they somewhat sit at different layers. Puppet is great at managing the behaviors and capabilities of machines themselves, whereas juju seems primarily dedicated to talking about sets of machines and largely punts how to make the machines behave any specific way to external tools like Puppet or shell scripts.\nOur strategy with Puppet is to build the best stack from the ground up, whereas juju appears to be a specific layer of the stack and leaving other layers to other tools. Thus, while you can solve the whole problem with Puppet (albeit sometimes with a bit more work than you might like), you'll need to integrate juju with other tools to get much done.\nReally, juju seems like an on-premise version of CloudFormation from Amazon, albeit without the graph and such. So, usable with Puppet etc., but not a replacement for it.\n\nA: In the simplest terms, juju encapsulates service discovery, a key value store, and configuration management.  Puppet/chef etc are pure config management.\nJuju is event based and uses a central \"bootstrap node\" to keep track of and orchestrate events.  Puppet and chef can be made to appear event based, however it's typically just running the relevant job on a schedule.\nAfaik, you can't run juju in a distributed or agentless state and this is possible with most configuration management systems.\nFor the most part puppet etc are domain specific languages, whereas juju is a system, not a language.\n\nA: Here's another take on how Juju fits with other automation tools:\n\nI am responsible for Cloud Strategy at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu and Juju. Juju is not a competitor of Puppet or Chef. Juju can install Puppet or Chef and from within a Charm, Juju's encapsulation of a service, you can call your existing Puppet modules or Chef receipts.\nSo what is Juju? Juju allows you to instantly deploy, integrate and scale your IT stack/services/applications. Instant IT gains without the pains. Either via command line or the GUI.\nSo Juju is closer to PaaS then to Devops tool since you can build your cloud (Juju is Canonical's default OpenStack installer), the infrastructure that goes on top of it (web/app/db servers, Hadoop, MongoDB, etc.) but most remarkingly Juju allows applications to be deployed and immediately integrated (add-relation between Wordpress and MySQL will automatically setup Wordpress tables and data inside MySQL).\nAlso app servers (java, php, node.js, scala, etc.) can work together with version control hence automatic deployment and scaling of your apps is possible. So unlike PaaS, you are not limited to a specific software stack but still get the instant deployment, integration and scaling advantages. Think of it as a flexible PaaS or FlexiPaaS that instantly deploys, integrates and scales your software services without being limited or being locked-in.\n\nSource - Warning: login required.\n", "Q: Can Wine software use Unity Application Menu? Wine applications which I used show menu under window top border. Is there any way to use global application menu in Wine applications? Will this function be available in next releases of Wine/appmenu possibly?\n\nA: I'll note that Mark Shuttleworth asked me this exact question about a year ago when Unity was first being shared with us.\nWine cannot use the global menu, and probably won't ever.  The reason is that Unity's global menu requires fancy rewriting of each windowing toolkit (GTK, for instance) -- this is why some applications like LibreOffice don't actually yet use the global menu: they were written with toolkits that Unity doesn't yet support.\nTo make the global menu work in Wine would require an even more invasive rewrite of Wine itself - Wine isn't just implementing the Windows graphical toolkits, but must also act as a window manager.  Windows applications have almost no qualms about doing very strange things, and likely many applications would break in bizarre ways if their menus were moved or worked even slightly differently.\n", "Q: what is the shortcut to force a logout? I am using the alpha 2 version of 11.10 and the keyboard options there do not have an option to force a logout.\nCan you tell me the keyboard shortcut so i can add it myself?\n\nA: It seems that the latest update added an \"options\" menu on the keyboard preferences-->layouts that lets me activate the \"control-alt-delete\" shortcut like before. Or it might have always been there and i missed it.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F1\nLog-in\nThen run this command on Terminal: killall -u USERNAME\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: You can open Keyboard shortcuts and create a new shortcut. Run the command killall -u yourusername gnome-session. \n\nA: When I have this problem, I simply Ctrl + Alt + F2 into a terminal, log in, and type\nkillall -u  [username] gnome-session\n\nThis will basically kill all of your processes and log you out. If you want to logout all users at the same time in this manner, then you leave out the -u [username] part.\nI guess you could create a new keyboard shortcut that runs this command. The only problem with this that I can forsee is if the freeze-up is because of gnome itself. Then it may not recognize the shortcut.\n\nA: You can enable CtrlAltBackspace in the keyboard options this kills the x server and will probably work even if CtrlAltDelete does not.\n\nA: Surprised that no one mentioned sudo service lightdm restart\n\nA: I would imagine this is the same as 11.04 (or possibly it's just that I'm running Gnome 3), but Ctrl+Alt+Del brings up a box allowing me to logout.\n", "Q: Upgrade remote server from 9.04 to Ubuntu LTS \nPossible Duplicate:\nSkipping intermediate Ubuntu OS upgrade to latest one,How do I upgrade from 9.04 to 10.04.2? \n\nMy situation: I'm stuck with a VPS which I have no physical access to.

I read in the news about all the malware that is infecting Android OS. The malware is in Google's App Store and people are unknowingly downloading and installing it.\nAs I understand, Ubuntu's Main repository is safe for me to download from (I won't be infected with malware from doing so) because Canonical engineers review the software. But what about other repos, most notably the Universe repository? Does the Universe repo receive any sort of review to protect from malware? Is it advisable to avoid the Universe repo for fear of unknowingly downloading malware from it?\nI've read PPAs are particularly dangerous because they are not reviewed. I'm assuming it is perfectly safe to use the Google Chrome PPA however.\nSo if I use nothing but the Main & Universe repositories and Google Chrome PPA, will I be protected from unknowingly downloading malware? \nIf Ubuntu does gain hundreds of millions of users like Mark Shuttleworth predicts, won't Ubuntu PPAs become the malware problem for Ubuntu like Google's App Store is today for Android?\n\nA: Staying with the Main and Universe repositories is very safe, and so are PPAs if they're especially popular (most of the time), or you know that they're going to be safe (like the Google Chrome PPA. I doubt Google would put any type of malware in it.) If you use Main, Universe, and your Google Chrome PPA, you'll be safe.\nIf Ubuntu gains a ton of users, then yes, there will probably be more malware. I don't think there'd be enough to be a real problem though.\n\nA: All of the official Ubuntu repositories (encompassing anything that you can find on archive.ubuntu.com or its mirrors, as well as some others) are entirely curated.  This means main, restricted, universe, multiverse, as well as -updates and -security.  All packages in there have either come from Debian (and so have been uploaded by a Debian Developer) or have been uploaded by an Ubuntu developer; in both cases the package that is uploaded is authenticated by the gpg signature of the uploader.\nYou can therefore trust that every package in the official archives has been uploaded by either a Debian or Ubuntu developer.  Furthermore, the packages you download can be verified by the gpg signatures on the files in the repository, so you can trust that each package you download has been built on the Ubuntu build farm from the source that was uploaded by an Ubuntu or Debian developer¹.\nThis makes outright malware unlikely - someone in a position of trust would need to upload it, and the upload would be easily tracable to them.\nThis leaves the question of more surreptitious nefariousness.  Upstream developers could put backdoors into otherwise useful software and these could make it into the archive - in universe or multiverse, depending on the license.  People do run security audits of the Debian archive, so if this software became popular it's likely that the backdoor would be discovered.\nPackages in main have some extra checking and get more love from the Ubuntu security team.\nPPAs have almost none of this.  The guarantee you get from a PPA is that the packages you download were built on the Ubuntu build infrastructure, and were uploaded by someone with access to one of the GPG keys of the Launchpad account of the listed uploader.  There's no guarantee that the uploader is who they say they are - anyone could make a “Google Chrome PPA”.  You need to determine trust in some other way for PPAs.\n¹: This chain of trust could be broken by an extensive intrusion into the Ubuntu infrastructure, but that's true of any system.  The compromise of a developer's gpg key would also allow a black-hat to upload packages to the archive, but since the archive emails the uploader of each package this should be noticed quickly.\n\nA: All the packages in Ubuntu Repositories before being uploaded are checked and reviewed by MOTUs (Masters of the Universe). MOTUs are the brave souls who keep the Universe and Multiverse components of Ubuntu in shape. They are community members who spend their time adding, maintaining and supporting as much as possible the software found in Universe. Therefore there are no chances of these packages breaking into your computer and stealing your data. However these packages might have security bugs which are flaws found in the software. Also some security-comprising software are available in Ubuntu (for example key loggers) but these packages won't steal your data (unless somebody intentionally installed it on your computer).\nHope this helps.

However, I don't believe this is an option, because I can't even get to the boot screen that asks me if I want to run the system off of the LiveCD, boot to hard disk, etc...\nIs there a way to somehow boot to a CLI before getting to the screen that would normally let me choose that? I'm at a loss as far as what to do.\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, the CD boots fine on other machines. (I've also burnt a couple discs just to be sure)\n\n*Yes, the graphics card is fine. I normally dual-boot with Windows 7, and it runs on Windows just fine.\n\n\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Make sure you have nomodeset selected before booting into the live cd. After you install ubuntu hold shift during the boot process to get to the grub menu, now edit the boot options and add nomodeset to the list of items, you can remove nosplash if you want to see what happening during bootup. Once you get into Ubuntu go to system/Admin./Hardware drivers. If its already installed, at the grub menu select recovery mode and you will be able to drop to a root shell prompt.\n", "Q: My sound and ALSA has gone when I installed Realtek drivers I made a confusion with some informations and I thought that I have a Realtek audio card, but in really I have an Intel 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller, so when I installed the Realtek High Definition Audio Codecs it made a mess with the sound-related files, resuming, in the driver's readme it says that by default it mutes every audio channel and you is supposed to use some ALSA or OSS mixer to unmute them, and was in this part I noticed I made this confusion, because I got this trying to unmute the channels:\nsudo alsamixer returns: cannot open the mixer: No such file or directory\nsudo amixer returns: amixer: Mixer attach default error: No such file or directory\nI already reinstalled every alsa realated package and got nothing, changing Sound Preferences settings doesn't work and there isn't any instructions to how to uninstall the Realtek drivers.

Ok, now I figured out how to sync my music from my iPod Touch with Banshee on Ubuntu 11.04 which wasn't that hard in the first place, pretty much plug and play. My question is, is there a way to copy off my movies that I have on my iPod Touch into Banshee and play them using either Banshee or say, VLC Player? I have absolutely no idea if there is a way to do this and so far my searches on Google have yielded very few results if any at that...\nAny help would be greatly appreciated even if it's a simple, \"Nope, can't be done...\"\nThanks Everyone!\n\nA: This cannot be done because of the security restrictions on the files.  iTunes and other movie sources have DRM or other protection enabled on those files, as such it cannot be loaded in non-iTunes systems or systems without the DRM information to unlock it.\nHowever, non-DRM videos should still be viewable assuming you have the correct codecs (for example, freely distributed videos, such as a video rip from YouTube)\n", "Q: Does Canonical pay application developers? When an application becomes default in Ubuntu, does Canonical pay the developer(s) for making it default or do they just use the application for free?\n\nA: They \"pay\" by contributing any bug fixes, feature upgrades back to the developer, as consistent with the nature of open source software, not to mention the press that such applications get by being included as the default software of a major OS.\n\nA: Open source software is determined by the license. There is nothing to stop a company from paying a software developer and then licensing their work as GPL for example. Clearly most open source developers aren't paid for their open source work.\n\nA: Yes.\nCanonical isn't Ubuntu; it's a multinational corporation that finances, owns, and controls Ubuntu. Canonical sells support, and software services. But, they have hundreds of millions in revenue, with offices around the globe. While it's true, the software in Ubuntu is largely not created by Canonical, it's not true to state that \"Canonical does not pay developers\".\nFor example, Canonical paid\n\n\n*\n\n*Scott James Remnant to create Upstart\n\n*Alan Griffiths, Kevin DuBois, were either on contract or paid for the development on Mir.\n\n*Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre on Network Manager\n\n*Michael Hudson-Doyle developing Launchpad and Go.\n\n*Iain Lane cPython/Launchpad \n\n\nI would guess there is a hundred? Other projects have been sponsored (GNU Bazaar), and other open source products like Quickly, juju, Storm, and Snap.\nAlso in 2017, 1% of the Linux Kernel Contribution comes from Canonical (that's not a high number at all, but it's non-zero).\n\nA: All of the default applications in Ubuntu are free software, and in most cases, certainly in all cases that ship on the CD, that means they are not for sale.\nIf Canonical did pay, it would be a gift. They ship software under the same licenses the software itself ships with. So, in most cases\n\n\n*\n\n*there just isn't any product or service that Canonical could pay for, even if they wanted.\n\n\nHowever, Canonical and other Linux distributors do sponsor by employing developers to work on software, of course. And, like TheX says, they contribute to the software itself. Which is the whole point.\n", "Q: How to set up virtual hosts for sites in each user's directory Hi I am looking to set up virtual hosts and I would like to put the files in each user's directory so I have each user and his sites held separately. \nSo for example john would have in /home/jean/public_html:\nwww.site1.com\nwww.site2.com\nand tony in home/tony/public_html:\nwww.site3.com\nwww.site4.com\nwww.site5.com\nCan anyone suggest a good tutorial for setting this up with Apache?

I've used the --purge parameter too and autoremove, but I am still finding folders and files belonging to packages I had uninstalled.\n\nA: That is the proper way, there is no better way available.\nFiles created into your home dir, or other files created during normal package working, as i.e. log files, do not get removed, and there is no easy way to do so, if the preremove and postremove script do not do so themself.

But my plan was to use my machine as a headless server to SSH into, so I didn't bother fixing this error until now. (And for the record, the full description of the error I encounted on my Dell 2009W display with Ubuntu 12.10 Server Edition was \"Out of range signal. Cannot display this video mode, change computer display input to 1680x1050.\")\nSo if you get this error and you want to fix it after installation (and have SSH access), do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Change the /etc/default/grub config file; uncomment the line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n(Note: At first this file was missing.

You probably want PAL 720x576 25fps 16:9, with MPEG-1 or AC3 audio; or for NTSC 720x480 and 23.97fps (or whatevs). However, you can use the \"dvd\" target preset to make things easy, simply by running ffmpeg -i input.avi -target dvd video.mpg\nTo turn the mpeg file to an DVD compatible folder structure, you need a tool like dvdauthor. There are probably some frontends to it, but the first example from the book, chapter 1.2, is probably sufficient for you. Put that example into file dvdauthor.xml and your video to video.mpg and execute dvdauthor -o DVD -x dvdauthor.xml.\nThis will result in a directory structure under folder DVD, which you can turn in to an iso file with genisoimage -dvd-video -o my.iso -v DVD. You can then copy my.iso to some other system and burn on a disc with wodim or some other tool.\nThe resulting disc should be playable in standalone players, but due to DVD limitations you may run into problems with arbitrary mpeg streams. Some of the problems may be fixed with dvdauthor and others with mplex from package mjpegtools.

From a security standpoint, a signed package means that the person who made it used a PGP key that is owned by them to say \"I created this package, and I verify its authenticity!\"  Unsigned packages are risky because you have no idea who the developer is (while you do with signed packages).\nThe other issue with updating is that if you use a PPA, it may be reading packages as unsigned if the PGP keys that originally signed them are not being downloaded, in which case you should make sure that you can connect to keyservers and make sure that the signee of the package has a key in the Ubuntu keyservers.\n\nA: If you don't have any PPAs and are just using a stock configuration and you are getting unsigned packages it could be a sign that the mirror you are pulling from is misconfigured or in the middle of updating or something.\nIf you see this error too often consider switching to another Ubuntu mirror:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change which mirror I get updates and software from?\n\nA: Often, you can fix errors about packages not being able to be authenticated by running sudo apt-get update to recheck the packages lists and redownload the signatures. If you are getting errors about authentication, do not be lazy and just install be packages. Instead, find out why the packages cannot be authenticated and fix that problem first.

I'm currently reading Operating System Concepts 7th edition by Silberschartz, Galvin and Gagne. At the end of chapter 2, there is an exercise \"Add a system call to the Linux Kernel\". Unfortunately, I realized the directory structure that the authors used is completely different with Ubuntu's one. For example, the authors referred to \"/usr/src/linux-2.x/include/asm-i386/unistd.h\", but on my machine, they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-10\n\n*/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-10-generic\n\n\nAnd inside this folder, I couldn't find anything called \"asm-i386\" :(. I wonder is there a documentation specified for Ubuntu? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you,\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't do anything special. Your first difficulty is that you don't have the kernel source installed, only kernel headers. The authors are describing a system with a copy of the kernel source in /usr/src/linux-2.x. If you're only compiling external modules, the headers, which are what you see on your system, are enough. Ubuntu ships kernel headers for that purpose in the linux-headers-* packages (which you would normally install via the dependency from the linux-headers-generic  metapackage). If you need the whole source, get a compressed archive from the linux-source-2.6  binary package.\nAnother thing is that the directory structure has changed a little over time; architecture-dependent headers moved from include/asm-$ARCH to arch/$ARCH/include/asm. Furthermore the i386 and x86_64 architectures were merged into a unified x86 in 2.6.24. (More details here.) So you now need to look in arch/x86/include rather than include/asm-i386.\nHere are a few useful resources for Linux kernel hackers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Device Drivers (LDD3)\n\n*LWN (news about Linux, including many technical articles about the kernel by one of the authors of LDD)\n\n*LXR to browse and search the kernel source\n\n*LKML (the Linux kernel mailing list), Stack Overflow to ask questions about the kernel and kernel development\n\n\nAnd also read this thread on Unix & Linux, which explains how to locate the implementation of an existing syscall.\n\nA: /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-10-generic/include/linux/unistd.h\nor in future kernels:\n/usr/src/linux-headers-KERNEL_VERSION/include/asm-generic/unistd.h\n:)\n", "Q: Does the kernel 2.6.38-10-generic plug a memory hole? On my Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit system, this morning the Update Manager wanted to install the 2.6.38-10-generic kernel, so I let it.  I haven't noticed any difference except that memory no longer seems to leak.  Usually, after awhile the memory usage increases gradually and doesn't drop much, even when I close programs, but since installing the new kernel it seems to return to \"normal\" (about where it was after reboot) when I close programs.  Of course, I don't really know if this is due to the kernel or to something else.  Does someone out there know if this was a fix in the kernel?\nI'm glad for the improvement, but don't really know what brought it about.\n\nA: There are changelogs for the kernel packages. I recommend you read them, they usually detail the various changes to the packages/kernels, including reasons for the update to the package.  (this answer was converted from a comment which I posted to this thread and removed after posting this answer)\n\nA: After a day of using the new kernel (2.6.38-10.46) that Ubuntu's Software Update wanted to install on my system, I can say that there is no doubt that it has made a significant and very noticeable difference in memory usage.  I ran everything I could so I could get memory usage up, and when I closed applications the memory usage just dropped back to normal.\nIn the past my system's memory use would slowly increase, even after applications had been closed.  I have 4GB of RAM in my system, and so after a day or two it would seem that 1.5GB were tied up, then in another day or two it'd be up to 2GB, and it would keep going.  Now, after closing applications I've been running, memory usage drops back down to 500 to 700 MB, which is around where memory usage is at right after I boot-up and before I've opened any applications.  I've seen no signs that memory is going down a hole, or being held and not released after an application closes.\n", "Q: Why use sbuild over pbuilder? There are numerous ways to build Debian packages in a clean and reproducible environment. Two of the most frequently used are pbuilder and sbuild. Personally, I've always used pbuilder. I find pbuilder much easier to use and maintain. I haven't been able to find any side by side comparison of the two. What am I missing out on?\nWhat advantages are there in using sbuild over pbuilder?\n\nA: sbuild and pbuilder have developed over the years to have nearly identical functionality, and as features are added to either, they tend to be quickly adopted by the other.\nAs Debian packaging is a policy-driven format, it is a significant aid in determining whether a given build issue is a bug in the implementation of the builder or a problem with the package being built to have multiple implementations of a build system.  In order to maintain this, the leading build systems must all have strong partisans supporting them, in a spirit of collaborative competition towards ensuring that we have the most correct available implementations of policy.\nThe internal mechanics of sbuild and pbuilder differ considerably, so precisely which packages are pulled to satisfy build-dependencies or how they are pulled, the precise mechanism by which the various targets in debian/rules are called, etc. may differ, causing some slight differences in behaviour in very specific cases for certain packages.  Most of the time this represents a bug in one or the other implementation, and sometimes reflects a lack of clarity in packaging policy: in any case, behaviour changes ought be resolved.\nOfficial buildds in both Debian and Ubuntu use sbuild (although often not the sbuild available from the archives), which is considered an advantage by some developers, as they have greater confidence that their configuration matches that to which their package will be exposed when built, although if everyone does this, we lose the ability to distinguish bugs in policy from bugs in sbuild.\nHistorically, my understanding is that pbuilder development initially focused on the needs of the developer as end-user and sbuild development initially focused on the needs of buildd and archive adminstrators.  Recently, these focuses have switched, as people have built archive management systems based on pbuilder, and more helpful developer tools using sbuild.\nBoth tools (or their commonly available close derivatives) support storing chroots as tarballs, unpacked on the system, in separate volumes (with available hooks for special mounting: e.g. LVM snapshots), using overlay filesystems, using copy-on-write semantics, etc.  Both tools offer trivial command-line tools to streamline the common case (test-build a package) and rich hook semantics to support complex cases (large archives).  Both provide a means to create a test environment in a chroot.  In short, both tools provide just about anything you might think you wanted in a package building tool (and both have active upstreams happy to accept bugs and patches).\nIn summary: if you're happy with pbuilder, keep using it.  If you want to play with sbuild, feel free.  The best tool is the one you are comfortable using for the sort of work you do.\n\nA: It's always dangerous to disagree with Emmet, so let me start off by acknowledging that his answer is probably more correct. However, I personally find pbuilder more user-friendly and more performant out of the box.\nIf you are on Ubuntu 12.10 or later, be sure to install the excellent pbuilder-scripts, which are a set of extremely friendly wrappers around raw pbuilder.\nIf you are on Ubuntu 12.04 you may install the pbuilder-scripts from the backports repository.\nNow, let's compare and contrast the user-friendliness of equivalent operations. In these examples, I'll walk through using an ARM chroot hosted on x86, but the concepts still apply to an x86 chroot hosted on x86 as well. Remember, I'm using the pbuilder-scripts wrappers.\nOne thing to note is that the pbuilder-scripts implement a bit of convention, similar to how Ruby on Rails makes some decisions for you so that you can get going quickly. I'll try and point these out as we go.\nCreate a chroot\nmk-sbuild --arch=armhf quantal\n\nvs\n# in addition to the chroot, creates a new, empty directory named ~/Projects/quantal-armhf\npcreate -a armhf -d quantal quantal-armhf\n\nverdict: tie, both command lines are pretty simple, and both can take extra options for fancier use cases if needed. However, do note the additional new directory created by pcreate.\nDownload a source package\n# standard debian/ubuntu method, works in any directory\napt-get source casper\n\nvs.\n# 'quantal-armhf' is the name of the chroot created earlier\n# results in downloading package to: ~/Projects/quantal-armhf/casper/\npget quantal-armhf casper\n\nverdict: slight edge for sbuild, because you're using standard debian/ubuntu best practice. The convention used by pget might seem strange at first, but since I work on multiple packages across multiple releases of Ubuntu, I like the organization it imposes. Note also that apt-get source also extracts the source wherever you run the command, leaving you with the *.orig.tar.gz, *.debian.tar.gz, *.dsc and the expanded directory, which I personally find to be messy. The beauty of the organization is coming soon, I promise.\nEnter the chroot, ephemeral version\nschroot -c quantal-armhf\n\nvs.\nptest quantal-armhf\n\nverdict: slight edge for pbuild, fewer characters to type is fewer characters. Note that in this version of entering the chroot, any changes you make here will be lost once you exit the chroot. Also note that in schroot, you will remain a normal user whereas with ptest, you will be in the chroot as the root user.\nEnter the chroot, save changes version\nsudo schroot -c quantal-armhf-source -u root\n\nvs.\nptest quantal-armhf --save\n\nverdict: slight edge for pbuild, fewer characters and more intuitive command line arguments, in my opinion. In this version of entering the chroot, any changes you make therein will be saved for future invocations.\nBuild a package within the chroot\ndebuild -S -sa -I -i\nsbuild -A --arch armhf -d quantal-armhf /path/to/casper-1.315.dsc\n\nvs.\n# must be invoked when pwd is ~/Projects/quantal-armhf/casper/casper-1.315\npbuild\n\nverdict: pbuild, now we see the first significant win when using pbuild's conventions. This is a dead simple command with nothing else to remember, versus specifying the architecture, the name of chroot, and requiring a path to a *.dsc file that sbuild requires. Additionally, you must remember to generate a new *.dsc file with sbuild whereas pbuild will do it automatically for you.\nBuild same package in chroot, a second time\nIn the above example, both sbuild and pbuild will download and install the build-deps in their respective chroots. However, pbuild saves the downloaded .deb files in /var, so if you invoke pbuild a second time, you do not have to download all the build-deps again (although they must still be installed in the chroot). sbuild does not cache the .deb files (at least not by default), and therefore, you must download all the build-deps again in addition to waiting for them to be installed in the chroot.\nverdict: pbuild by a long shot. Caching the build-deps is a great default setting, and pbuild is smart enough to detect if there is a newer version of a build-dep in the archive and will pull down the new version if required. For a complex package with many build-deps, this simple setting will save you minutes of your life.\nSummary\nOut of the box, I find pbuilder-scripts to be much friendlier and faster than the sbuild equivalents. Of course, there are ways to make pbuilder even faster (build in a tmpfs, disable some of the chroot hooks), and there are probably the same tricks for sbuild too, but I'm unaware of them.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run Gnome 3 without 3D acceleration hardware?

For example, a E4500  @ 2.20GHz cannot keep up with heavily encoded x264 1080p streams without VDPAU. An Intel video card on a 2GHz system isn't going to work, I don't think. :(\n\nA: Maybe your laptop has a weak graphics card or heat problems. What does totem do?\n\nA: Even when there is no such a \"Minimal requirements\" for h264 video playback (the audio is not your problem at this time), you should consider using a high performance GPU in order to experience the best results on your playback.\nInformation provided in the answers to this question may give you an idea of what a hardware I am talking about. Of course, I am for nVidias (1GB or more) but you can choose a different brand name. Anyway, Intel embedded graphic cards won't achieve a smooth playback for high demanding video codecs (like h264).\nYour microprocessor is good enough for a smooth playback but you may be experiencing an issue at the moment that your computer needs to \"draw\" the things on screen. Task that is normally achieved by the GPU, not the CPU itself. When I answered this question I was using a microprocessor similar to yours, with a PhysX SPARKLE GeForce 9500GT 1024MB/DDR2/CRT/DVI-I/HDCṔ/SLI/PCI Express 2.0 and experiencing no problems during the playback.\nSmooth fullscreen 1080p playback\nPlaced here for your convenience:\n\nThe minimum? What a question.\nI have several nVidia based graphic cards with both 512 MB and 1024 MB\n  in different systems, and both are good for playing high definition\n  video files. The best, of course, is the 1024 MB card, which is not\n  expensive at all.\nYou may experience a better performance starting at 1024 MB video\n  card. And I am talking to those times when you wish to play a high\n  definition video and do something else. Or when using two monitors to\n  extend the desktop, etc.\nThere are new video cards with DDR3 memory systems which will\n  absolutely work better than DDR2 memory based systems.\nI prefer the nVidia's but I know that ATI's are also good and many\n  people prefer ATI over nVidia and I have seen an ATI RADEON with 3 GB\n  memory system at work, owned by a gamer friend.\nTake in consideration that any video card starting at 1024 MB memory\n  system will do the work with ease.\nMy nVidia models are: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*ZOGIS GeForce 8500GT 512MB DDR2 PCI\n  Express\n  \n*PALIT 9500GT Super 512MB/128Bit/DDR2\n  Dual Link DVI/TV-Out PCI Express 2.0\n  \n*PNY VERTO GT220 1024MB DDR2 PCI\n  Express\n  \n  \n  And my favorite and the one that I am using when writing this is the:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*PhysX SPARKLE GeForce 9500GT    1024MB/DDR2/CRT/DVI-I/HDCṔ/SLI/PCI \n  Express 2.0\n  \n  \n  This graphic card features no fan and a big aluminum heat sink, which\n  makes absolute silently performance and you won't face the problems\n  when the fan fails because of the dust or typical problems on the fan.\nIn this link you can find a screen recording of my system when playing\n  a RAW mpeg HD Video file when using dual monitor view. (Take in\n  consideration that I am running in a 2GB RAM system and the screen\n  capture may differ of what I see on this side).\nThe video is played windowed and full screen in my left side monitor.\nFor download only, at:\n  http://geppettvs.servehttp.com/resources/desktop.ogv (right click,\n  save target as)\nIn VLC, Menu \"Media\" and \"Open Network Stream\", enter the url and\n  click \"Play\".\nThe specs of the video file can be seen in the next screenshots.\n \nMy current monitor config in the next screenshot:\n\n\nAdditionally, the comments on the original answer will be very illustrative also.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can I set the default log in session? I am using 11.04 with Gnome 3 installed. Before I log in I am prompted to choose in which environment I want to log in. Among the possible selections is gnome, how can I set the default choice?\n\nA: Well - I'm using 10.04 and xUbuntu, and with german menu translation, which is a bit different, but you should as well have a section settings where a lot of settings are. \nThere you should find a group 'session and starting' or similar. There you should be able to select what the default is. \nMaybe you have 'save session on shutdown' and 'login to last session'. Using them in combination might lead to the desired result. If you change the settings, but don't save it at shutdown, the start of last (saved) session will always lead to the same, old session.\n\nA: Ubuntu Classic (or Classic Ubuntu, whichever its called) is the 11.04 equivalent of the original GNOME login.

I've followed these instructions but I don't see any difference after restarting, and when running apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine and apt-get install light-themes, it only says that it's already at the newest version.\n\nA: I have solved my problem. It turns out that the murrine daily PPA was deleted, but someone on the Ubuntu Forums had a copy of one of the debs from June 2nd, 2011 that was made for 10.04 64bit (debs.tar.gz > gtk2-engines-murrine_0.91.0~git201106021418~daily1~lucid1_amd64.deb). I downloaded that archive and installed the deb in it, and then I downloaded version 0.1.8.2 of the light-themes source from Launchpad. Finally, I extracted that into /usr/share/themes and everything's working!\n\nA: Check this, it worked very well for me: https://launchpad.net/~glasen/+archive/ubuntu-artwork-backport.\n\nA: You can get them using Ubuntu Tweak.

It worked for me in Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: I recently had this problem, but it appeared out of nowhere, one day. Of course, editing configuration files is doable, but not my purpose.\nBut apparently if you have one of the options there activated, the menu automatically appears. In my case, I had the scaling factor of the text at 1.01 (instead of 1.00), which triggered the \"Large Text\" configuration, which forced the icon. Simply disabling it (and thus, resetting the scaling factor to 1.00), did the trick.\nSo if you don't need any of the accessibility features (or they are just on by accident), disabling all of them will probably make the icon disappear.\n\nA: on GNOME Shell 3.38.2 the extension below worked for me:\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2398/hide-universal-access/\n\nA: Easy, Click the control Cog at the top right (the one to the right of your name>)\nSecond click System Settings, from there select Universal Access, then select typing and UNSELECT \"turn on accessibility features from the keyboard.\"\nThe icon should instantly disappear.

In the the past I used to use xmodmap to prevent the Caps Lock button from working, and then tell Launchy to handle the key press instead. I can't seem to do this anymore.\nWhat is the best way to disable Caps Lock's normal behavior, and make it do something else?\n\nA: From howtogeek.com which has a good answer for any OS.\nFor Linux (including Ubuntu):\nsetxkbmap -option <OPTION>\n\nWhere <OPTION> can be for example of:\n\n\n*\n\n*caps:none – Disables Caps Lock.\n\n*caps:super – Caps Lock becomes an additional Super (aka Win key).\n\n*caps:ctrl_modifier – Caps Lock becomes an additional Ctrl.\n\n*caps:numlock – Caps Lock becomes an additional Num Lock.\n\n*caps:escape – Caps Lock becomes an additional Escape.\n\n*caps:backspace – Caps Lock becomes an additional Backspace.\n\n*caps:swapescape – Caps Lock becomes Escape, and Escape becomes Caps Lock\n\n\nNote: Xmodmap is deprecated in favor of setxkbmap.\n\nA: The following method uses the combination of Compiz to launch an application when a key-press is made.\nIn summary - \n\n\n*\n\n*change the behaviour of the Caps Lock key to mimic another key.\n\n*Configure compiz to listen for the newly mimic'd key and run a custom script.\n\n\nChange the caps lock key\nToo change the behaviour of the Caps Lock Key, you can use xmodmap as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a file e.g. \"capslock\"\n\n*copy and paste the following into the file\n\n\n\nkeycode 66 = cent\nclear Lock\nadd Control = cent\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*now run xmodmap to recognise your change:\n\n\n\nxmodmap capslock\n\nTo run permanently add this command to the startup applications.\nPressing Caps Lock now just mimics pressing a \"cent\" key - note this is not a key that actually exists on my keyboard.\nYou can get a list of KeySym names from here.  \nConfigure Compiz\nStart the CompizConfig Settings Manager\nIn the general section, ensure \"Commands\" is enabled and configure a command as shown:\n\nN.B. enable the key binding and use \"grab key combination\" to recognise your \"cent\" key.  You cannot get compiz to recognise the cap lock key itself unfortunately.\n\nObviously - change \"firefox\" for whatever command you use to start \"launchy\"\nNow when you hit the Caps Lock key, compiz will recognise the mapped \"cent\" key and run the command - in this case firefox - in your case \"launchy\".\n\nA: *\n\n*Use the xev command. When you hit enter, xev will launch. xev takes all of your input and poops info about the key into the command line. I recommend bringing your mouse over the exit key of the xev window, hitting caps lock (or whatever key you want to find out about), and immediately exiting xev. The relevant lines on my system, for caps lock look something like:\nKeyPress event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x4400001,\n    root 0x27a, subw 0x0, time 19164277, (16,-9), root:(1156,46),\n    state 0x2, keycode 66 (keysym 0xffe5, Caps_Lock), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x4400001,\n    root 0x27a, subw 0x0, time 19164397, (16,-9), root:(1156,46),\n    state 0x2, keycode 66 (keysym 0xffe5, Caps_Lock), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nNotice keycode (66) and keysym (0xffe5).\nYou could also, now, get data for another key -- one you don't really use, and which, in the context you want to use the caps lock button in, doesn't do anything. So, if you want caps lock to activate the Unity searchbox (like super usually does), maybe use `, for example. On my machine:\nkeycode 49 (keysym 0x60, grave)\n\n\n*Bind the new key's function to the Caps Lock button, using xmodmap. I'm pretty sure you want to use a command like:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66=0x60\"\n\nNow, if you hit the physical caps lock button in a text box, the grave character (`) will appear. But if you map a shortcut key to it, it will do something else. If you want to be able to use it in a text box, perhaps replace caps lock with left shift, or f10, or something else that doesn't seem like it will interfere with the command you want to use.\n\n*Test it to make sure the command I gave you works the way you want it to.\n\n*Go to startup applications, and add that command to your startup applications. This way, the key will switch properly every time you start up.\n\n*Dance.\n(shout out to theprise) Change Keybindings (hardware to software)\nAlso, for more help on xmodmap:\nhttp://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/xmodmap.1.html\nhttp://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/X11/xmodmap.html\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nsetxkbmap -option <OPTION> from Wernight's answer seemed to work immediately for me.\nHowever it would go away on reboot.  To address this I added to my startup applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for and run Startup Applications >> Click Add\n\n*Put in /usr/bin/setxkbmap -option <OPTION> as the command (Note: the full path is important)\n\n\nReplace <OPTION> with something like caps:escape (I use it for vi)\nBackground\nI just upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04 and whatever I used to map this before stopped working.\n\nA: while of course the xmodmap option would work I wanted to find an option that uses the GUI. This is available for me (using Ubuntu 15.10):\n\n\n*\n\n*install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n*go to 'type'\n\n*under 'Behaviour of Caps Lock key' choose 'Caps lock is disabled'\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10 - 13.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Keyboard Layout application and click the \"Options\" button.\n\n*A list of rebinding options will apear. Select \"Caps Lock key behavior\".\n\n*Select your preferred Caps Lock repurposing option.\n\n\n\n\nA: The option that I found the best for me (in any X compatible wm/de) is adding\nOption \"XkbOptions\" \"caps:swapescape\"\n\ninside the \nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"system-keyboard\"\n    MatchIsKeyboard \"on\"\n    Option \"XkbLayout\" \"US\"\n    Option \"XkbOptions\" \"caps:swapescape\" # << is what you want\nEndSection\n\nblock in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf (create if necessary).\n\nA: You can disable it by going to keyboard->Layouts->options->caps lock behavior and choose \"disable caps lock\" .\n\nEdit:\nI don't know why it seems inconvenient with another Keyboard keys.\nBut Launchy works fine with me after trying it with CTRL+Super+Space.\n\nAnd you need to white-list launchy to the tray icons. See How do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray?.\nAlso you need to add it to the Start Up applications, as it won't work when it is not opened.\n\nAfter all, As an alternative for Launcy, try Synapse\nfor its best integration with gnome and unity.\n\nA: This is basically a modification of the answer provided at https://askubuntu.com/a/223674/22073.\nYou can also modify the behavior of Caps Lock using an XKBOption. These changes are even propogated to the virtual consoles (/dev/tty[1-6], or Ctrl-Alt-F[1-6]).\nFor instance, to disable Caps Lock, you would have the following in /etc/default/keyboard:\n# Check /usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/README.Debian for\n# documentation on what to do after having modified this file.\n\n# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same\n# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options\n# in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"caps:none\"\n\n# If you don't want to use the XKB layout on the console, you can\n# specify an alternative keymap.  Make sure it will be accessible\n# before /usr is mounted.\n# KMAP=/etc/console-setup/defkeymap.kmap.gz\n\nThen you would run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\nFor a full list of the customizations of XKBOPTIONS, take a look at /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst. Here's the full list from my Ubuntu 13.10 machine: http://sprunge.us/cUZO\nEven more information can be found on the ArchLinux wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_Configuration_in_Xorg\n\nA: To remap the useless caps_lock into a basic shift, do\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 66 = Shift_L\"\n\n\nA: The most robust solution is to buy a keyboard that lets you remap keys in firmware, i.e. a professional, programmable keyboard.  \nThese usually cost around 200 bucks and also have high grade mechanical keyswitches. They are expensive, but they are the only way to avoid having to fight with this at every new machine you sit down at, and each time the developers make breaking changes to OS infrastructure as fundamental as the keyboard map.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a SATA drive I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 on a SATA drive on a desktop computer.

I use Firefox as my default browser.\nEmail is a Chromium webapp pinned to the launcher, with a Google Apps account so it's basically GMail.\nMost solutions involve the 'desktop-webmail' application that doesn't work in Unity, or setting the default browser to handle the mailto: links. \nCan I set Firefox, Chromium and maybe even Nautilus to use my Chromium webapp?\n\nA: Create a custom script with e.g. name \"mystarter.sh\" (make it executable) , paste inside it the two line command:  \n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/chromium-browser --app=https://mail.google.com/mail  \n\nThen you can set the required mailto: handler in Firefox.  \nOpen the Preferences->Applications type mailto -> select action \"other\" and set the 'mystarter.sh' script.  \nNext, open gconf-editor and go to \n/desktop/gnome/applications/url-handlers/mailto and set the command for your chromium webapp \n", "Q: Are resized or moved partitions in any way worse than unmanipulated partitions? In comparing a resized or moved partition to unmanipulated partitions (as in created and used partitions that have never been resized or moved), are the unmanipulated in any way worse given that both are properly aligned?\nI'm not asking which is safest way to handle because I know that resizing or moving partitions might harm them so that data is lost. What I'm asking is if there's any relevant difference of resized or moved partition and unmanipulated partitions such as in performance or security given that both are properly aligned. That is, is resizing or moving partition in any way advised against if it's excluded that you might lose data as you do it and that you might mess up alignment?\n\nA: No, assuming there are no errors during the move or resize operation, there is no difference between the original partition and the modified one. It's just copying of digital data from one place to another, there is no degradation of data like you would get with an analog videotape or something.\nIt is possible that other things that refer to the locations of partitions, such as boot loaders, might be affected by the change if they are not properly updated.\n", "Q: How do I change which mirror I get updates and software from?

During that time, the shole system becomes unresponsive, with high HD activity.\nIt becomes unresponsive when retrieving mail, too: it stalls for about 30 secs. Closing evolution can take yet another 1.5 minutes, also.\nIs there any way I can speed things up?\n\nLast Edit: As I have checked that reducing my inbox file size (by means of moving old mail to an 'Archived Mail' folder) does the trick of speeding everything up, while keeping a copy of every mail at hand, my ultimate question is:\nIs there any \"auto-archive\" feature or plug-in or script or anything for Evolution? I could do it \"by hand\" using saved searches and such, but it would be nice to have it automatically done (as it is in Outlook, for instance)\n\nPrevious Edit:\nAnswering comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evolution retrieves POP mail from gmail and a personal postfix/courier mailserver\n\n*I could change to any other mail client provided that A) migration is easy enough  B) Speed problems are likely to vanish with the new client and C) I can sync contacts and calendar with gmail\n\n*I'm not experiencing high HDD activity problems with other apps, and swap is not (or at least should not be) a problem, since it's usually at 0% (I'll keep an eye on it, anyway)\nOther considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used to work with Outlook and it managed several 2 Gb files (one was actually the inbox, and three were \"archive.pst\" files, to which I never added more mails, except when Outlook auto-archived old ones). I even would like to add this pst files to Evolution, so that I can be able to search old mails, but A) I don't know how and B) I'm scared... If evolution can't handle properly a 2.3 Gb file, adding load would be a bad idea, I suppose.\n\n*I guess things would speed up if I could \"move\" some old mail from my Inbox file to another one, but it should be readable and searchable. Anyway, I don't know if this can be done with Evolution, and, as stated, is just a guess.\n\n\nA: Beware the .PST files are limited in size by design, i do not recommend using THAT big size into a single file. I use netcat for mail, when no Web avaliable.\n", "Q: How to force Ubuntu One contacts sync with Evolution? I am using Evolution in Ubuntu 11.04, and I have encountered a problem with trying to synchronize contacts with Ubuntu One when they are created through the web interface. The contacts I have created this way will not sync into my Evolution contacts.\nI have searched for people having the same issue but couldn't find anything. So my question is: how can I force Ubuntu One to update all my contacts in Evolution to match those in the web interface?\n\nA: Ubuntu One contacts and bookmarks sync (desktop-couch sync) is not functional. You can see the status here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/Status. When it's up again, all contacts you have in desktop-couch contact lists will automatically be synced.\n", "Q: How do I kill a locked SSH session?

What is the easiest way to set up scheduled backups of all my sites to the same VPS or to another server? Thanks.\n\nA: I am currently using rsnapshot to backup my sites. It makes it super easy to take incremental backups, and only stores a new copy of a file when it has changed. It doesn't do delta changes though, so even if a file only changes by 1 byte, it will store a completely new copy of the file. Otherwise it uses hard links to save on disk space. The copying is done using rsync, meaning that you can back up remote sites easily as well!\nThe beauty of this system is that it's super easy to restore from backups... just use the regular old 'cp -r' function. \nIt works really well for us - we host a large number of Joomla sites, where the core files almost never change. We have our main backup repository on an Amazon EBS volume, which mirrors itself to our office server nightly.\nIt does use a fair number if inodes though (since everything is a link) so you'll probably want to keep an eye on that (use 'df -i' to see the usage of inodes) or reformat a partition. And there's no encryption for the backup files. It does make its remote backups through ssh though so that's encrypted.\nI'm sure other posters will have good suggestions as well!\n", "Q: How do I highlight an item in Nautilus? When we download something in firefox and right-click on item [firefox->download] and select open with folder it just open containing folder [nautilus] but does not highlight the downloaded item. \nIn windows and mac open folder highlight the downloaded item. It is very difficult to find recently downloaded file if there are so many existing file or folder. Is there is any way to do this in nautilus?\n\nA: The specific feature you asked about is not availaale, but here are a couple of alternatives:  \n\n\n*\n\n*When nautilus is open at the relevant directory, just start typing the first few letters of the file name. This will highlight the file.\n\n*Using the following tools you can use the clipboard and skip the typing, as follows:\nInstall these: sudo apt-get install nautilus-scripts-manager xdotool xsel\nThen create the following nautilus-script in the nautilus-scripts-manager directory.  \n#!/bin/bash                           \n xdotool type $(xsel -o -b; sleep .3) \nNext, assign a short-cut key to run the script.\nIt is very practical to use a short-cut key which is local to nautilus. You can do this via a combination of nautilus-scripts-manager's sub-menu item for this script (under nautilus' File menu), and a gnome short-cut key manager tool, which is described in this link: \"Editable Menu Accelerators\" (on a per app basis).  \nSet up a short-cut key, eg. Ctrl-Shift-S, and then just copy the filename to the clipboard. amd run the script via the short-cut key. This will \"type\" the text in the clipbooard, as though you typed it, and the nautilus auto-search feature will pinpoint the file and highlight it.   \nMore: You could modify the script to strip out the filename from the downoad link... This means that you could sometimes(often?) just copy the download link to the clipboard.\n", "Q: How can I get Update Manager to Check & Notify for DAILY updates In Software Sources, I have Update Manager set to check for updates DAILY.

I would like to install just a base system, but having the ubuntu package manager and the repositories, even without gnome, and install using the command line, but with the Mac drivers (for example, multi-touch and webcam). Anyone knows a guide for that?\n\nA: *\n\n*Minimal CD Image for Ubuntu\n\n*Ubuntu-Wiki LowMemorySystems Installation\n\n*Google Knol Minimal Desktop Installation Guide\nThe minimal CD image will give just the command-line operating system, which allows you to install all the needed packages to run the graphical-X system.  Following either/both of the guides you can pick and choose exactly what you want to be included in your new system. After that, you can login into the base OS and run your preferred package manager (Synaptic, Muon, etc...) to add the extra packages from available repositories and ppa.\n\nA: Even if you're not setting up a server you can achieve this by installing Ubuntu Server and choosing not to install any additional packages during the installation. This will give a fairly minimal system.\n", "Q: Realtek 8190 wireless doesn't work I have a Realtek RTL 8190 (802.11n) Wireless controller.\n> lspci -v | grep Network\n04:01.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I have Network UPS Tools (NUT) core system loaded on ubuntu 11.04 (client), but can find no application to run from the system menus. The software center description says the following programs in NUT are run from a terminal: upsc, upscmd, upsd, upsdrvctl, upslog, upsmon, upsrw, upssched. I want to monitor and configure a single UPS via a GUI interface. I checked device manager and the UPS is visible (via usb port). I also checked sysv-rc-conf to confirm that NUT is running on levels 2-5. Is there another interface I need to install? What's the next step?\n\nA: Configuration is mostly done with text files in /etc/nut.  The example files provided are well documented, and should include a full set of files.  I deploy the following:\n - nut.conf (all systems) - standard startup mode script, now checked by Ubuntu\n - upsmon.conf (all systems) - controls which ups to monitor for power failure\n - upssched.conf (all systems) - controls scheduled activities based on events \n - upssched-cmd (all systems) - command script run by upssched.conf (see below)\n - upsd.conf (NUT servers) - controls network access for the server\n - ups.conf (NUT servers) - controls which UPS(s) get monitored\n - /etc/default/nut (Debian based systems, including Ubuntu) - controls which programs are launched on system reboot.\nIf you have multiple systems on one UPS you will need to decide if files need to be modified per system or type.  nut.conf will at should be different for clients and NUT servers. The NUT server configuration files need to be done per server.  upsmon.conf needs to indicate which UPS(s) to monitor and use to trigger a shutdown.  Seen the man pages and/or documentation.\nYou can configure and control your UPS with the nut-cgi package which provides a web based interace via http://localhost/cgi-bin/nut/upsset.cgi.  I use upstats.cgi to  monitor the UPS.  You can use the supplied templates, or modify them to suit. It requires the following files:\n - hosts.conf - which hosts to report on\n - upsset.conf - indicates you have secured your server and wish to enable upsset.cgi\nFor on-line configuration, I have had success with knutclient.  It provides a nice interface to monitor and configure your UPS.  Once the configuration is done, it is rare you need to use it.  The NUT site lists other tools under Related Projects.\nI wrote the following script to dump load shortly after a power failure (Don´t trigger them on the monitoring server.

If you are using a proxy without any user authentication (i.e., user name and password) use http-proxy=http://PROXY_URL:PORT/ instead.\nFor example to have GPG_KEY=C2514567EEA14886 you can use,\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver-options http-proxy=http://user:abc123@10.10.2.21:3128/ --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C2514567EEA14886\n\nwhere,\nUSER_ID=user\nPASSWORD=abc123\nPROXY_URL=10.10.2.21\nPORT=3128\n\nIf you don't have user authentication simply use,\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver-options http-proxy=http://10.10.2.21:3128/ --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C2514567EEA14886\n\n\nA: The reason your sudoers change did not work as expected is that instead of:\n    Defaults env_keep=\"http_proxy\"\n    Defaults env_keep=\"https_proxy\"\n\nYou should have written:\n    Defaults env_keep+=\"http_proxy\"\n    Defaults env_keep+=\"https_proxy\"\n\nAlso make sure the space between Defaults and env_keep is a tab each time.\n\nA: I managed to workaround this by editing /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/softwareproperties/ppa.py and adding\n\"--keyserver-options\", \"http-proxy=<proxy_url>\",\n\nunder the following line\n\"--keyserver\", self.keyserver,\n\nMore background information\nppa.py is the python script that is used by add-apt-repository to call gpg. There sometimes seem to be a bug with gpg where it does not use the http_proxy environment variable.

If your proxy supports it, you can also use a url like http://my.proxy:port/www.target.site.com/url which I know works for apt-cache-ng\nI'm not sure if add-apt-repository itsself uses these settings, but if you cannot make that work, you can always add the repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*mytoolchain*\nSince 11.10 there is also a cross-toolchailable in the main repo, just apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf.

The manual says to add .curlrc in your home directory. Because apt-add-directory is root's own, it means adding it to /root/.curlrc:\n    proxy_http=\"http://192.168.99.4\"\n    proxy_https=\"http://192.168.99.4\"\n\nA good idea is to do the same in your own ~/.curlrc\nAlso, enabling the proxy in /etc/wgetrc is a good thing to do, although it has nothing to do with the question asked, I'm just saving you another search on Google (if you read this, you have multiple with a proxy)...\n\nA: System wide environment variables should really be added to /etc/environment (use sudo or gksu), but the error reported to you seems to state no gpg data was found.

In my case, I'm executing the command on my laptop which is connected through my home internet provider. Although my internet provider doesn't require me to set http(s)_proxy, I figured that my internet provider may have some settings on their end that somehow (unintentionally) blocked the connection for this command.\nI turned on a personal client VPN on my laptop. That got around whatever connection restrictions my home internet provider may have had. It worked!\nSo, if you have either a personal or work VPN for your laptop (and you're executing the command on your laptop), try it.\n", "Q: Wireless connection works but the internet is too slow to use in Ubuntu 11.04 The internet is so slow as to be unusable. And I'm not being picky. Even after minutes I can't get my Google home page to load. I tried installing a package through apt-get and was getting rates between 0 and a few hundred bytes/s. That's bytes, not kilobytes! Mostly 0 however (no exaggeration, it spends large amounts of time stalled). And I would go to a speed test web site of some kind but I can't since nothing will load.\nBriefly put, the laptop I am using was connected to two wireless networks while using Ubuntu 11.04 without any issues before this. It was also connected to a wired network without any issues. It dual boats Windows 7 which has never had any issues, not even with the current wireless network.\nJust to be clear, on the current wi-fi network, Windows 7 encounters no issues (speedtest.net puts the network speed at 1mb/s) but my network connection in Ubuntu 11.04 is so slow as to literally be unusable.\nI am unfamiliar with the router except for the fact that it boasts a Rogers logo (that's a large ISP/cable provider in Canada for those not familiar with the land of igloos and polar bears). I am far from the router and some desktop widget I use tells me the signal strength is at 58% (it seems fairly reliable and this would appear to match up with the filled bars in the network icon).\nI should also mention I'm just renting a room in this house so I'm not the network administrator and while I can access the 192.168.0.1 router page, the password wasn't set to 'password' so it's not much use to me.\nHere are a bunch of commands I ran which don't tell me a whole lot but I thought might be more instructive to the wise around here:\nlspci (just showing my network card):\n05:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

From its man page:\n\nSource chroots\n         Some  chroot types, for example LVM snapshots and Btrfs snapshots, provide session-managed copy-on-write snapshots of the chroot.  These also provide a source chroot to allow easy access to the filesystem used as a source for snapshotting.  These are regular chroots as well, just  with  the snapshotting disabled.  For a chroot named \"sid-snapshot\" (i.e. with a fully qualified name of \"chroot:sid-snapshot\"), there will also be a corresponding source chroot named \"source:sid-snapshot\".  Earlier versions of schroot provided source chroots with a '-source' suffix.\n  These are  also provided  for  compatibility.  In this example, this would be called \"chroot:sid-snapshot-source\".  These compatibility names will be dropped in a future version, so programs and scripts should switch to using the namespace-qualified names rather than the old suffix.\n\nOtherwise you can look at other copy-on-write filesystems (in short COW), as copyfs, cowdancer.\n", "Q: Reduce Window Border Size? One of the most annoying things about Ubuntu is probably the ~3-5-pixel border distance between the buttons on the title bar and the top and right sides of the window.\n\nIs there any way to reduce that to zero?\n\nA: Okay, I found part of the solution:\nGo open /usr/share/themes/Clearlooks/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml and modify the right=\"1\" top=\"2\" values in the line saying\n<frame_geometry name=\"normal\" ...>\n    ...\n    <border name=\"button_border\" left=\"1\" right=\"1\" top=\"2\" bottom=\"1\"/>\n</frame_geometry>\n\nThis fixes the button issues.\nHowever, this does NOT work for the title bar frame! If I go to the top of a maximized window's title bar and double-click it, it doesn't toggle the maximization. I need to move down the mouse by a few pixels to do that.\nIf anyone knows how to fix that part as well, that'd be great! Otherwise this is my best answer so far.\n\nA: There are many window border themes in Ubuntu, some of which nearly don't have a border at all. Try one of these.\n\nA: The Adwaita theme for GNOME Shell seemed to me like it would be what you're looking for, and after a quick search on gnome-look.org I found a GTK 2.x version of it. Note that you will need the Equinox GTK+ theming engine installed for it to look right, but it's easy enough to find in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Installed server but track the desktop kernel Is it possible to have a system originally installed with the Ubuntu 10.04 server edition both use and track updates of the desktop kernel (i.e. linux-image-generic instead of linux-image-server)?\nI assumed the difference between the packages tracked by the desktop and server editions would be reflected in /etc/apt/sources.list, but the two look similar to me. So, how does a system know which kernel to track?\n\nA: Yes. To install use:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-restricted-modules\n\nThen it will know to update both.

Your command-line environment is the parent of the script's shell, so it does not see the variable assignment.\nYou can use the . (or source) bash command to execute the script commands in the current shell environment and achieve what you want, e.g.\nsource ./script.sh\necho \"$BASE\"\n\nWill produce\n/home/develop/trees\n\nThe source command, often seen in scripts, is a bash synonym for ., which is part of the POSIX standard (so . is available in dash, for example, but source isn't).\n. ./script.sh     # identical to \"source ./script.sh\"\n\n(. script.sh and source script.sh will first look for script.sh in PATH, so it's safer to specify the path to script.sh.)\n\nA: When you run a script, it runs in a subshell. Variables are only valid within the context of that subshell. Set them in your .bashrc or .profile and read up on  variables and subshells. The export statement works down hierachy (current shell and all it's subshells) not up as in your example.\nAlternatively (if you really want the script to effect the enviroment of your current shell) run it as:\n. ./script.sh\n\nThat causes it to run in your current shell but will not pass variables up the hierarchy either.\n", "Q: How to Restore GRUB after installing Windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I repair grub?

I have a lot of songs, movies, pics, etc. saved on my computer but I have no idea how to get it from my Ubuntu desktop. And will all this information be lost if I change to Ubuntu? (I have a LOT of stuff so using a hard disk, USB  is not an option.)\n\nA: One thing you should be able to do is go under \nPlaces -> Name of your Drive -> Opposite Click -> Mount \nand if it does mount you will then be able to access it, see what's on it just like you would be able to do in Windows. If that can happen then it's a simple matter of drag and drop. \nIf you cannot see it in your Ubuntu partition then you can use an external USB HD like a Western Digital backup drive or something like that and just copy all your files/folders to that external drive, then plug it in your Ubuntu partition and drag and drop it to that...other than that there really isn't any easy way of doing it...\n\nA: it isn't clearly stated on which setup-variant you run your systems, but maybe you meant the following:\nIf you have had your 'Ubuntu' installed via the 'WUBI'-Installer, so set it up as a virtual partition, which is stored as one or more files inside the 'Windows'-Partition, then you can access the 'Windows'-contents through the 'host'-folder.\nIn Nautilus you find it in the tree view under 'File System', or by clicking the hard-disk-icon in the breadcrumb-selector topping the file-view where your files and folder-contents are shown (the main visual of nautilus).\nAs an alternative you can open up a terminal or use the keys [ALT]+[F2] to open up the run-command and there typing in > nautilus /\nThe slash represents the root of the 'File System' and therefore is the topmost point in all of your folder-tree-structure.\nIf it is not the case that you just can't see your 'Windows'-partition, because it is inside the 'host' to hinder you deleting files necessary for running Ubuntu, then you might want to check if, due to a update- or setup-failure the system doesn't perform ntfs-access.\nTo find out if your system supports windows-partition-reading you can start Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Center and use the search field (positioned neat to the main menu) to look for 'ntfsprogs' or for 'libntfs' and make sure one of them is installed.\nThere are several more ways to perform all these tasks, so just take it as a hint.\n", "Q: Custom Apache 404 page I want to customise the 404 page of my Apache Webserver on Ubuntu to something other than the general:\nNot Found\n\nThe requested URL /***** was not found on this server.\n______________________________________________________\n\nApache/*.*.** (Ubuntu) Server at **** Port 80\n\nHow can this be accomplished?\n\nA: <VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:80>\n    ServerAdmin admin@host.ru\n    ServerName host.ru\n    ServerAlias www.host.ru\n    DocumentRoot /home/WebServer/www/host.ru/public_html/\n    ErrorLog /home/WebServer/www/host.ru/logs/error.log\n    CustomLog /home/WebServer/www/hostu/logs/access.log combined\n\n\n    Alias /error_html/ \"/home/WebServer/www/host/error_html/\"\n    <Directory \"/home/WebServer/www/host.ru/error_html\">\n        AllowOverride None\n        Options IncludesNoExec\n        AddOutputFilter Includes html\n        AddHandler type-map var\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n        LanguagePriority en cs de es fr it nl sv pt-br ro\n        ForceLanguagePriority Prefer Fallback\n    </Directory>\n    ErrorDocument 404 /error_html/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Here is a solution.

While I have a nautilus window open I can do Ctrl+Shift+N to create a new folder in the current directory. However there is no default keyboard shortcut for creating a new document. How would I create one?\n\nA: First, open gconf-editor and set /desktop/gnome/interface/can_change_accels to true.  This lets you edit menu shortcuts.\nSecond, open a terminal and type:\nkillall nautilus && UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= nautilus\nThis will relaunch Nautilus with the standard (non-Unity) menu bar, because the Unity menu bar doesn't support this feature. (It will respect your changed shortcuts, but it won't let you change them.)\nNow, open the file menu, hover the mouse over Create Document > Empty File and press your desired shortcut. Ctrl-Alt-N seems like a decent choice, or you can reassign Ctrl-N. You should see the accelerator hint change in the menu.\nFinally, relaunch Nautilus without the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY variable to get your Unity menus back with the new shortcut.\nEdit: The solution for newer versions is nearly the same , except you need to use dconf-editor instead of gconf-editor. You can install the dconf-tools package to get dconf-editor.\nAlso, the killall nautilus ... command did not appear to be necessary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run dconf-editor.\n\n*Go to org/gnome/desktop/interface.\n\n*Check the box for can-change-accels.\n\n*Open Nautilus and highlight the menu item whose key binding you want to change, either with your mouse or via the keyboard, and press the key(s) you want to use as the shortcut.\n\n*Don't forget to uncheck can-change-accels in dconf-editor after you're done.\n\n\nA: Open terminal:gconf-editor\ngo to\n/apps/metacity/keybinding_commands\n\nfind unassigned command e.g. command_1\ndouble click on value and type /usr/bin/gedit\nnext step go to \n/apps/metacity/global_keybindings\n\nselect run_command_1 (in this example) , double click on the value and set the preferred shortcut\nLogout/Login from/to system\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04, I tried to change the accels by hovering-and-pressing-shortcut but it didn't seem to work. Then it dawned upon me, \"Hey, why not use the default accels?!\"\nAnd it worked perfectly for me.\nSo here's how to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt + F to open the File menu.\n\n*Press D to go-to the New Document sub-file menu.\n\n*Press E to create a new document.\n\n\nIf you just press it rapid succession, it feels almost like a keyboard shortcut.\nPress Alt + F, then immediately D and immediately after that E. Boom. You're welcome.\n", "Q: Sort albums by date in Banshee Banshee has an option - sort albums by release date, not by name, but turning it on do nothing. All tags are filled correctly. Is at a bug or I miss something?\n\nA: Banshee's option to \"Sort an artist's albums by year, not title\" currently affects the sort order in only the full track list. This option does not affect the order of albums in the album list (the grid with all the album covers). This has caused quite a bit of confusion -- see Bug 544758 and its 5 duplicates.\nIf, however, you mean that turning on that option doesn't change the sort order anywhere -- even in the full track list -- then that is definitely a bug, and you should report it.\n\nA: This bug is also raised on lauchpad as Bug 784301\nDon't forget to mark the bug as affecting you.\n", "Q: How can I correctly install multiple non-package Distribute/virtualenv/pip ecosystems on Ubuntu? I am developing Python applications in Ubuntu. I want to setup a Distribute/virtualenv/pip ecosystem to manage my Python packages independently of any system Python packages (which I manage in Synaptic, or rather I let the system manage them for me).\nI could just install the python-setuptools, python-virtualenv and python-pip system packages and be on my merry way, but I also want to be able to get latest/specific versions of Distribute, virtualenv and pip. There are no PPAs for these, so I'll have to install them manually.\nA final complication, is that I want to be able to do this for multiple versions of Python. That is, set up one ecosystem for python2.6, another for python, another for python3, or on a 64-bit system another for chrooted 32-bit Python.\nI'm guessing that the process would be something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Python X install my own copy of Distribute to a location in my home folder\n\n*Using indie Distribute, easy_install pip\n\n*Using indie pip, install virtualenv\n\n*Using indie virtualenv, create virtual environment\n\n*Activate virtual environment, install packages\n\n*Repeat for Python Y, Z and Q\n\n\nWhat installation/configuration options am I looking for?\n\nA: virtualenvwrapper does much or all of what you're asking for.  It is very popular based on the traffic here and at stackoverflow. It has been packaged in Ubuntu since Precise / 12.04.\n\nvirtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking’s virtualenv\n  tool. The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting\n  virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,\n  making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without\n  introducing conflicts in their dependencies.\n\nSee this answer on StackOverflow for some examples. In your case, you seem to be looking for this virtualenvwrapper command: mkvirtualenv --python=PYTHON_EXE (makes a virtualenv with a specific Python executable).\nFinally, there is a coordinated effort to review and update Python packaging in general and taking platform-specific use cases into account, so you may want to consider following progress in the Python Packaging User Guide.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use Package Manager to install any Python versions you require (python3, python2.6, etc)\n\n*Download the latest version of virtualenv .tar.gz from PyPI\n\n*Follow this system-agnostic process to create virtual environments with pip and Distribute installed.

After downloading its package, I usually have to go to the directory where I extracted it and then run the the script using \nsudo ./sage\n\nfrom terminal. How can I add sage to the list of installed applications, that I will be able to run the script by typing sage command from any directory in terminal?\n\nA: You'll need to add that scripts directory to your PATH variable. This can become tedious if you download a lot of self-contained executables. My recommendation would be to create a bin folder in your home folder and place all your self-contained executable files in there. \nMost recent versions of Ubuntu already have their PATH setup to read from $HOME/bin so it'll work after a restart of the terminal or after you type source ~/.profile. Once that's completed you should be able to just enter sage in to the terminal.\nIf you wanted to add another directory, other than ~/bin, you can open the .profile file in your home directory and add the following line to the bottom:\nPATH=\"/path/to/folder:$PATH\"\n\nReplacing /path/to/folder with the absolute path to the directory you wish to add. That will prepend the directory of your choice to your PATH environment and it'll take effect once you enter source ~/.profile (or restart the terminal).\n\nA: Put the script in your bin directory.\n", "Q: Why does sysinfo list my CPU as having 1,6GHz when I have an i5-2300 CPU @ 2.80GHz? I would like to know whether there could be a driver I'm missing, since sysinfo can't see  the correct value for my CPU frequency\n\nA: It's probably just because the processor frequency has dropped to save power due to it being idle. If you run a processor intensive task and look again you should hopefully see the correct frequency.\nYou can also see this information by running cat /proc/cpuinfo in a command line. For example, my computer has one core currently heavily loaded. Along with a load of other information I get this for the heavily loaded core:\n\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         950  @ 3.07GHz\ncpu MHz         : 3060.000\n\nSo that just about matches up with the 3.07GHz. For another core I get:\n\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         950  @ 3.07GHz\ncpu MHz         : 1596.000\n\nThe current frequency is halved over the maximum.\n", "Q: Compiz Clampdown? I'm using Gnome. \nI've discovered suddenly that I can't resize most windows. I hover over an edge or the lower right corner and the drag bar appears, but I'm not able to engage it. I tried turning off a lot of things I wasn't using in Compiz (which turned on ages ago, so why that would work I can't say) and now I can't even move windows around. The cursor behaves the way I'd expect but clicking and holding doesn't allow any movement. \nIt is obviously a little exasperating, and I'm wondering how to go about troubleshooting this. \nUpdate: Compiz is definitely the issue. If I do metacity --replace I get a functional, no frills, X Window Manager. If I try to restore Compiz (compiz --replace) the problems come right back with it. \n\nA: Restoring Compiz defaults in CompizConfig Settings Manager did the trick (it is in the preferences tab)\nThat doesn't explain how everything got stuck in the first place, but it did get it unstuck.

The Chromium Stable PPA (as found here: ppa:chromium-daily/stable) is maintained by Chromium Team (https://launchpad.net/~chromium-team). I assume this is \"Google's\" Chromium developers? If so, I would assume this PPA is very safe and trustworthy. \nBut is there a specific procedure or method of investigation that I should/can do to confirm the identity of the maintainer? As I understand it (or at least have read), anyone can create a \"Chromium Team\" PPA. For safety and security, I'd like to learn how to confirm the identity of PPA maintainers, especially \"big name\" maintainers like Google or Mozilla.\n\nA: The \"Chromium Team\" in Launchpad are Ubuntu developers, not Google developers (except for one, who works on Chromium at Google). You can see this by looking at the team's membership:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~chromium-team/+members#active\nThe way you would determine if upstream maintainers are active in a team is to see if you recognize names (or email addresses). For the large projects like Mozilla and Chrome where Ubuntu developers work with their respective upstream generally speaking I trust them. \nFor example the team that runs the Firefox PPA is the same team that maintains Firefox in the distribution, and the team that maintains the Chromium PPA is also the same team that maintains Chromium in the distro.\nThere's really no way to determine how \"trustworthy\" a PPA is on a glace (Which is why most people will usually recommend not trusting them by default). Currently there is no real way for you to know just how \"official\" a PPA is unless it's explicitly mentioned by an upstream as trustworthy (see how XBMC recommends a PPA in that link) or you recognize the people in a team. In Open Source since everything is done in the open trust is something that is earned by people based on behavior. For example I trust someone who works at Mozilla to write my browser and I trust someone who is an Ubuntu developer to package it properly since both organizations have a model of peer review. \nIndividual PPAs are another matter, there's no guarantee that they won't break anything, but that doesn't mean every one is automatically bad. Chris talks about this a bit about PPA security in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which Ubuntu repositories are totally safe and free from malware?\n", "Q: Is there a Document scanning and archiving software? I'm looking for some kind of (free or open source) document management application which should allow me to store paper documents in my personal computer allowing me to add fields of information with data entry to be able to get the digital copy back.\nFor example, if the document is a fine I can find it if I remember the date or the fact that is a fine or another custom field I could add to search.\nOCR full text search would be a great plus but not mandatory.\n\nA: LogicalDOC Community  could be used for this purpose.\nAllows you to catalog and tag many file types and has a built-in free OCR.\nOne of the features that I really like about this package is the full-text search engine that can run natively language specific searches.\nThere is a good documentation for installation on Ubuntu, which doesn't involve special difficulties\n\nA: There are several open source document management systems and scanning solutions which would work to help your archiving needs. \nFor document management there is: \n\n\n*\n\n*OpenKm (seems to include OCR, though it's not immediately clear whether that's part of the community edition)\n\n*Mayan EDMS (includes OCR, pure OpenSource project written in Python, so just pip install mayan-edsm)\n\n*KnowledgeTree\n\n*LetoDMS (seems rather dead)\n\n*OpenDocMan\n\n*Nuxeo\n\n*Feng Office\n\n*Project Looking Glass\n\n\nAs for scanning software, there are a few open source options - but nothing that will perform too well. Depending on what you are looking to archive (and how you plan on accessing it in the future) you might be able to just tag your documents accordingly inside of your management software. Also...you are unlikely to find solid OCR in any freeware scanning application. \nIf you have the option, I strongly suggest outsourcing document conversion projects. Not only will you get it done faster - you will have the option to OCR your files and know that the finished quality of your project will be professional and easy to read. \n\nA: There is a document management system that does pretty much exactly what you require, called Archivista. I've evaluated it for our museum's archive. \nIt can be downloaded as an installable ISO or purchased pre-installed on small business computers. I do not know of a possibility to install it under Ubuntu, however, which may be a dealbreaker for you. Here, we just run it as a virtual machine and interact with it via X forwarding and its HTML interface.\nArchivista claims the software is designed for long (approx. 20 years) data retention periods. It can make use of scanners, and stores an image of the scanned document, a PDF and OCR version. Documents can be assigned metatags, and their OCR'ed text is searchable.\n\nA: I think you are looking for document catalog management software. I am using Calibre to manage my ebooks. Apart from pdf, it also supports MOBI, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS format.\nI am not sure, if it supports Ms doc format. But you can check it out.

In particular I would like to know how I check if /home and swap is encrypted.\n\nA: Regarding the standard home encryption provided by Ubuntu, you can \nsudo ls -lA /home/username/\n\nand if you get something like\ntotale 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 username username 56 2011-05-08 18:12 Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.desktop\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 username username 38 2011-05-08 18:12 .ecryptfs -> /home/.ecryptfs/username/.ecryptfs\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 username username 37 2011-05-08 18:12 .Private -> /home/.ecryptfs/username/.Private\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 username username 52 2011-05-08 18:12 README.txt -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt\n\nthen the username's home directory is encrypted. This works when username is not logged in, so the partition is not mounted. Otherwise you can look at mount output.\nAbout the swap, do\nsudo blkid | grep swap\n\nand should check for an output similar to\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1: UUID=\"95f3d64d-6c46-411f-92f7-867e92991fd0\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\n\nA: In addition to the answer provided by enzotib, there's the possibility of full disk encryption as provided by the alternate installer.

You can see which filesystems are on that via the lvm tools.\nIn the case of LUKS encryption, the Disk Utility in Ubuntu will also show the encryption layer and the configuration in a graphical manner.\n\nA: To check the encrypted swap status and cipher details, use this cmd:\n$ sudo cryptsetup status /dev/mapper/cryptswap1\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is active and is in use.\n  type:    PLAIN\n  cipher:  aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n  keysize: 256 bits\n  device:  /dev/sda2\n  offset:  0 sectors\n  size:    8388608 sectors\n  mode:    read/write\n\nYour swap device name may be different, you can check the proper name by:\n$ swapon -s\nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1  partition   4194300 0       -1\n\n", "Q: Repartition encrypted partition When I installed Natty (11.04) I chose to encrypt /home and I chose to mount it on a separate partition. I would like to repartition /home without losing data and by having the same sort of encryption after the repartitioning is done.\nI guess that this would mean to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily storing the data I want to keep somewhere else.\n\n*Repartitioning.\n\n*Putting the data pack on the partition.\n\n*Activation of encryption.\n\n\nOr maybe I can clone the data on the partition so that I can skip the last point?

Back up your data.  (Always a good idea.)\n2. Boot from a LiveCD with GNU parted.  (I believe the Ubuntu CD has this.  GParted is a Gnome front-end that makes this easy.)\n3. Have Parted resize the partition.\nBecause you're using eCryptFS, you can just resize the underlying partition and filesystem without any interference to the encryption layer.\n", "Q: Why do I get a purple screen whilst installing Ubuntu Server 11.04 I'm trying to install Ubuntu Server 11.04 on an 64-bit AMD machine.

These can then be selected with the arrow keys and Enter.\nFor a single hit solution in later versions you can use this script to create a keyboard shortcut. First you need to download the script and save it on your computer. Next you need to make it executable by right clicking on it and going to properties → Permissions → Allow executing file as a program. Finally go to System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts and click the small plus symbol. For the command type in\n/home/toby/power.sh shutdown\n\nor whatever path you saved the script to.\nSuspend, hibernate and restart are also available by this method; just replace shutdown in the above command.\n\nA: There are some low level keyboard shortcuts available. They talk directly to the kernel and can break things. You probably shouldn't use these. But in the interest of counter-acting the atrocious answers recommending this method, here's how to use the SysReq button to shutdown or reboot your system. If your cpu bursts into flames because of these incantations, well, can't say I didn't warn you.\nGraceful\nReboot\nThere is a mnemonic here: busier backwards. As in, you are too busy to shutdown properly, so you are doing it backwards.\nalt +\nSysRq +\nr ,\ne ,\ni ,\ns ,\nu ,\nb\nI borrowed this from wikipedia*:\nunRaw      (take control of keyboard back from X),\n tErminate (send SIGTERM to all processes, allowing them to terminate gracefully),\n kIll      (send SIGKILL to all processes, forcing them to terminate immediately),\n  Sync     (flush data to disk),\n  Unmount  (remount all filesystems read-only),\nreBoot     (durr)\n\nShutdown\nThis is the same except at the end use o for Off instead of b for reBoot.\nalt +\nSysRq +\nr ,\ne ,\ni ,\ns ,\nu ,\no\nDestructive\nThis is like yanking the power cord out. You risk destroying recently saved data (files not quite actually written to disk) and you will definitely lose anything unsaved. On the upside, it is quick and to the point.\nreBoot:\nalt +\nSysRq +\nb\nshut Off:\nalt +\nSysRq +\no\nUse in graphical desktop environment\nUnder graphical environments like Unity, alt + SysRq takes a screenshot.

If you need the old functionality back you will have to define your own shortcut by opening Keyboard -> Shortcuts from System settings and add this command:\ngnome-session-quit --power-off\n\n\nAlternatively we can use a shoutdown only dialog as shown in this answer\n/usr/lib/indicator-session/gtk-logout-helper --shutdown\n\n\nNote\nBefore we can use Ctrl+Alt+Del we will have to assign another shortcut to logout.\n\n11.04 and earlier\nUsing default keyboard settings pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del will open the following window:\n\nThe first entry is selected by default for an immediate shutdown by just pressing Return in addition.\nThere also is a countdown that shuts down your system after 60s without any further keyboard action.\n\nA: Well, an easy one to try is to open the keyboard shortcuts.\nIf using Unity, press the window key/superkey and then type shor and select keyboard shortcuts. Here you can then create a new shortcut and then assign a key combo to shut your pc down… without using your power button!\nThe command for your shortcut should be:\n/usr/lib/indicator-session/gtk-logout-helper -s\n\nWhich will shut you down!!\nHere is mine which I did to test it:\n\n\nA: After install Gnomenu, I found out another simple way to shutdown the computer immediately without choosing any option.

But you can eliminate this prompt by making a configuration change in the gconf-editor. Then the shortcut I posted above will directly and quickly shutdown the computer without prompt.\n\nA: This is a good way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Super key (also called the \"Windows key\").\n\n*Press L twice.

They're useful to me so if you want to reboot hit sysRequest+alt then type REUSB if you want to shut down always sysRequest+alt and type RSEOUI \nHope that will help ;]\n\nA: Try the combination of Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del\n\nA: Best is Ctrl+Alt+Del as many have said. That's the best way (especially for non-advanced users). If you wanna do it more 'geekily',then try opening a terminal and typing in the command (halt I think it was).\n[ If the system is not responding, you can do Ctrl+Alt+Backspace which will forcefully log out of the system. (It won't shut down, just log off). I believe it's a safer alternative to the 'SysResq' key combo. ]\n", "Q: How do you find out which program is using too much memory?

As you use more applications on your laptop, your buffer/cache/allocated memory increases, by allocating more memory specifically to those applications. This memory increases to allow you to easily access those applications in memory, which increases performance.\nHowever, newer applications may now have to struggle with the free/unallocated memory left, because the buffer/cache/allocated memory even though they are free, they have already been allocated to some set of applications that you are currently using.\nI found some script online that helps you free up some buffer/cache/allocated memory for other applications to use without restarting your machine. You may have to run the script once a day/week.\nfree -h && sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3 && sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free -h\n\nResources: How do you find out which program is using too much memory?\nThat's all.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: System fails to start after compiling grsec kernel Recently I've tried to compile kernel with grsec patch to increase security of my machine.

I checked the grub default file (/etc/default/grub). The GRUB_DEFAULT=6 setting (including counting BOTH previous core selections) matches the convention of menu order selection (i.e. starting with 0, then 1,2.3...) and the change from using Start-up Manager, but the grub boot screen displays the first menu selection as default. Now, using Start-up Manager again, if you select the option JUST BEFORE the desired default (in this case, Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200), the default reverts to WinXP, the last selection. I confirmed the change was listed correctly as GRUB_DEFAULT=5 in the grub default file.\nAny suggestions on cleaning this up? I have used Start-up Manager numerous times prior to the core update and had no problems. It's also easier than manually editing the grub default file.\nNote: I have no trouble loading grub and booting into any manually selected OS, it's just the default is not reflected properly in the grub boot screen when making changes from the Start-up manager.\n[System info: running ubuntu 11.04 dual-boot with WinXP (ubuntu on separate hard drive)]\n\nA: Grub2 Customizer:\nI have always had issues configuring Grub2 with Startup-Manager; Grub Customizer developed by Daniel Richter is a very intuitive GUI to properly configure GRUB2.  With it you can add a background image to Grub as long as the picture is also residing with /boot folder; you can edit both menu entries and the menu timeout length; my favorite feature is the ability to boot into the previously selected operating system (i.e. If I manually select to boot into Windows7 than the next time this same entry will be the default entry in Grub).\n", "Q: How can I prevent users from accessing the root directory?

Even after adding myself to root, I still can't access directories with 'other group' read permissions disabled.\n\nA: If all you want is for the users to be able to sftp files to/from a particular folder, why don't you set them up with an sftp chroot?  This will make the folder you designate appear to be the root in their login.\nSee:\nhttp://www.debian-administration.org/articles/590\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=858475\n\nA: sudo chown o-r /etc\n\nshould already give you an error, since chown doesn't know o-r; are you talking about chmod perhaps? \nHowever, you shouldn't fiddle around with permissions of system folders. Programs will stop working, support advice will fail. I can't imagine a reason to forbid people to read /etc. \nIf you did only that, you should undo it, if you did such things recursively, you can do a reinstallation, which is faster than a manual correction. \nA good idea would be to ask such questions before doing it. Davids advice, to use a chroot-environment, is the canonical way to prevent untrusted users to access your directory tree.\n", "Q: Formatting microSD card error I'm trying to format a SanDisk 16GB microSD card but when I do I keep getting the following message:\n\nOne or more partitions are busy on /dev/mmcblk0\n\nHow do I correct this so that I can properly format the card? I've tried formatting it with GParted but it never makes it past the second step.\n\nA: try umount it first.\nUse the new utility that comes with ubuntu , its name is disk utility or something like this.\nor try open a terminal and do \nsudo mkfs /dev/mmcblk0 -t ext3\n\nor -t vfat\nif you want to use it on windows\n", "Q: What's the difference between unfs3 and nfs-kernel-server? I tried to install nfs using sudo apt-get install nfs-server (for the purpose of streaming audio files to a Mac running OS 10.6) and discovered that I have two packages to choose between. \nPackage nfs-server is a virtual package provided by:\n  nfs-kernel-server 1:1.2.0-4ubuntu4.1\n  unfs3 0.9.22+dfsg-2\nYou should explicitly select one to install.\n\nIs there any particular reason to choose unfs3 over nfs-kernel server? Is it faster or slower? More or less stable? Does it matter at all?\nApart from the fact that I will be streaming some fairly large files (flac), I will be doing nothing out of the ordinary. It's on a closed network so there are no security concerns. \n\nA: http://unfs3.sourceforge.net/\nUNFS3 is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server specification. It provides a daemon for the MOUNT and NFS protocols, which are used by NFS clients for accessing files on the server\nUNFS3 being user space based, and not widely deployed, I wouldn't really trust it. nfs-kernel-server is linux's standard nfs server\n\nA: nfs-kernel-server is my choice and the recommended default server. It supports both NFSv3 and v4 and always works well for me. I believe unfs3 only supports v3.\n", "Q: How can I boot to and access my Windows 7 partition or reinstall Ubuntu? I'm running a dual boot windows7/ubuntu box and I deleted my ubuntu partition from windows because I had a problem updating to ubuntu 11.04. When I boot my PC, I get an \"error cannot find partition\" message and get the grub rescue prompt. Further, my bios won't detect when I attempt to boot ubuntu from USB. \nHow can I boot to and access my windows 7 partition or reinstall ubuntu?\n\nA: Firstly, you'll need to restore Windows boot loader using Windows 7 DVD.\nBoot from the Windows 7 DVD, and go to System Recovery, and from the available options, select Command Prompt and enter following Commands.\nBootrec.exe /FixMbr\nBootrec.exe /FixBoot\nThis should restore Windows Boot loader, and after restart, you'll not be presented with GRUB menu or any Partition related errors. Once you boot into Windows, you know the later steps to install Ubuntu.\nAnd as far as booting from USB stick is concerned, you'll need to make settings in BIOS such that USB Stick is set as first device boot from. While most modern computers allow to boot from USB Sticks, this may not be the case with a fairly old machine (but your machine doesn't seem to be older since its already running Windows 7 :-) )\n\nA: You can download Hirens Boot Cd.  From this boot cd you can boot every installed OS system on your computer? I suppose you have installed ubuntu with wubi?\n", "Q: Why do i have choppy video playback? I'm facing a problem with Blu-ray (.mkv) videos on my PC. When the video is playing sometimes it just freezes or plays quickly, but the sound goes on and later the video starts playing properly. \nI tried switching to different media players (Movie player, splayer, vlc player) but the same problem occurs. \nAlso, I reconfigured the graphics card settings but I'm easily able to play HQ games.   \nGraphics card - ATI Radeon HD3470\nPC - Sony VAIO FW\nUbuntu 11.04  \n\nA: Big videos like that can choke video cards if they don't have native codec support.\nBest bet is to check your video card drivers are up to date, in the past I've had trouble getting drivers for ATI cards. Yours is old enough that ubuntu should have them in the restricted hardware thingy.\n\nA: You should probably enable frame dropping and/or disable the loop filter on high definition movies. For example, on UMplayer/SMplayer these can be found on prefences --> performance.\nYou should also experiment with some options about the video output . On the above mentioned players, you can find it on general --> video --> output driver. This should probably not be needed if you disable the loop filter above but it has proved useful to me in the past.\n", "Q: Software removal without Synaptic or dpkg for manually built software I have a Ubuntu system with a mix of softwares that were installed either by\n\n\n*\n\n*synaptic/dpkg\n\n*manual built and install\n\n\nHowever, I would now like to remove those software that were manually built and installed. Is there a systematic way of doing this? \n\nA: sudo make uninstall\n\nIt removes the manually build/installed software, it needs to be executed on the same folder it was originally builded upon.\nAnother version of the sources should not work correctly, so you have to keep the original sources folder.\nTIP: THATS why i recommend replacing sudo make install by sudo checkinstall which makes an easy to remove .DEB file\n", "Q: HTC Trophy not detected When I plug in the device via USB chord, nothing happens and the device is not shown on the desktop.

That way you know for sure.  Then once you're sure, if it IS detected and it doesn't mount, then it just isn't seen as a usb storage device.  \nIf you need some functionality that isn't present for a USB device on the linux side, you can install windows in a virtualbox VM and enable USB passthrough.  USB passthrough isn't available in the open source edition as far as I know.  For that reason you have to install it with the binary installer from the Oracle website to get to a fully functioning USB passthrough setup.  \nThe guys on FreeBSD evidently reversed the USB passthrough component and got something working for Virtualbox OSE.  Maybe someone will port their adaptation to linux one day.\n\nA: Check to make sure that HTC sense is installed, and that you dont have USB Debugging enabled on your phone. If that dosent work, check the phone's screen when you plug it in, it should have multiple options e.g \"Charging only, Mount as Mass storage/Hard Disk, IPsec Pass through ect\". If it dosent, you may have a problem with the phones script not running for when it is attached to a computer. Also check that it isnt just the cable.

I can find it listed when I search for \"zsnes\" in the Ubuntu Software Center but it doesn't have the \"Install\" button. If I click the \"More information\" button I'll get a \"package not found\" message.\nSynaptic can't find this package either.\n(from user @REJ) I have Natty 64bit. When I run sudo apt-get install zsnes it gives the following output:\nReading package lists... Done Building dependency tree\nReading state information... Done Package zsnes is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source\n\nE: Package 'zsnes' has no installation candidate\n\n\nA: zsnes exists in the Universe repository for 32bit Natty only.  \nIf you look here on launchpad for the zsnes package, you'll note there is no 64bit package available - just the 32bit (i386) package.\nTo get this to work under 64bit requires a bit of terminal work...\nDownload the 32bit package from here into your Downloads folder.\nInstall all the dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install libao4 libc6 libgcc1 libgl1-mesa-glx libpng12-0 libsdl1.2debian libstdc++6 zlib1g\n\nThen do the following:\ncd ~/Downloads\ndpkg -x zsnes_1.510-2.2ubuntu4_i386.deb zsnes_dir\ncd zsnes_dir/usr/bin\n\nYou can now run the application by running\n./zsnes -ad sdl\n\nsource\n\nA: simply run this command first\napt-get build-dep zsnes\n\nIt'll download and install all the 32bit dependencies to get zsnes to run. Next you just install zsnes as usual using this command\napt-get install zsnes\n\nfinally, after you have successfully installed zsnes we just want to get rid of the  dependencies we needed to install/build it by simply running this command\naptitude markauto $(apt-cache showsrc zsnes | grep Build-Depends | perl -p -e 's/(?:[\\[(].+?[\\])]|Build-Depends:|,|\\|)//g')\n\n\nA: I thought I'd share a different strategy that I ran across in the search for installing ZSNES on amd64.\nIf you don't mind using a different emulator (a better one in my opinion), there is a port of SNES9x available.\nFirst, add these sources to your sources.list file in etc/apt.\nto edit the file as root, open your terminal and type: \ncd etc/apt\nsudo gedit sources.list\n\nOnce that is opened, add these two lines into the textfile, and save:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/bearoso/ppa/ubuntu raring main \ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/bearoso/ppa/ubuntu raring main \n\nALSO, REPLACE \"raring\" WITH WHATEVER VERSION OF UBUNTU YOU ARE RUNNING CURRENTLY.\nThen, in your terminal, type:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOnce that is done, install the program using this command:\nsudo apt-get install snes9x-gtk\n\nOnce installed, just search for the app in your dashboard, and run it!\nConfig is simple, and it's a great emu in my opinion, it's been around for years, and this port works great so far.\n-Chris\n\nA: This worked for me on my desktop, but not for my old laptop.\nHave tried a lot of thing to get a working snes emulator. When i was giving it up, i downloaded zsnes for windows and accidentially ran it, and it worked!! I did install PLAYONLINUX from software center some time before that, basically it runs great with WINE.

Basically, I'm trying to put a dark panel with a gradient in the Orta theme.\nWhere do I find the answer?\n\nA: The unity panel does use gtkrc files, the only way to change how it looks is to edit graphic files in /usr/share/unity/themes\nHere is a little guide which can help - unity launcher colors and patterns\n\nA: Here is quick and dirty solution for your quiestion!\nFirst things first, you will need to get .rc file for your panel, containg discription of how panel looks. You can write your own, or take it from the other theme.\nFor example, let's take this file from Ambiance theme at:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/apps/gnome-panel.rc\n\nYou need to copy it into Orta theme folder:\n/usr/share/themes/Orta/gtk-2.0/gnome-panel.rc\n\nNow open the Orta .gtkrc (/usr/share/themes/Orta/gtk-2.0/) file scroll, it down, and type:\ninclude \"gnome-panel.rc\"\n\nReselect Orta theme after that.\nAs I told, this is dirty solution and only shows how it can be done. For better looking you will need to write your own .rc file for panel. As for me, I think shiki-color panel looks nice in orta theme =)\n", "Q: How do I get sound working in Unreal Tournament 2004?

Occasionally, my system gets into a state where some kernels are missing a module or two, because DKMS somehow forgot to compile those modules for that kernel. Rather than spend time diagnosing the problem, it would be nice if there was a single command I could run that woudl just rebuild every dkms-controlled module for every installed kernel. Is there such a command?\n\nA: Doesn't look like the dkms command allows you to do that. I created a small Python script that should do what you want. You can put an alias in your ~/.bashrc like \nalias dkms-buildall='sudo ./wherever/your/script/is'\n\nOf course you'd need to make it executable first. Here's the code:\n#!/bin/env python\n#\n# NOTE: This assumes that all modules and versions are built for at\n#       least one kernel. If that's not the case, adapt parsing as needed.\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Permission check.\nif os.geteuid() != 0:\n    print \"You need to be root to run this script.\"\n    exit(1)\n\n# Get DKMS status output.\ncmd = ['dkms', 'status']\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\ndkms_status = process.communicate()[0].strip('\\n').split('\\n')\ndkms_status = [x.split(', ') for x in dkms_status]\n\n# Get kernel versions (probably crap).\ncmd = ['ls', '/var/lib/initramfs-tools/']\n# Alternative (for use with Arch Linux for example)\n# cmd = ['ls', '/usr/lib/modules/']\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\nkernels = process.communicate()[0].strip('\\n').split('\\n')\n\n# Parse output, 'modules' will contain all modules pointing to a set\n# of versions.\nmodules = {}\n\nfor entry in dkms_status:\n   module = entry[0]\n   version = entry[1].split(': ')[0]\n   try:\n      modules[module].add(version)\n   except KeyError:\n      # We don't have that module, add it.\n      modules[module] = set([version])\n\n# For each module, build all versions for all kernels.\nfor module in modules:\n   for version in modules[module]:\n      for kernel in kernels:\n         cmd = ['dkms', 'build', '-m', module, '-v', version, '-k', kernel]\n         ret = subprocess.call(cmd)\n\nTested it here, seems to work just fine:\n$ dkms status\nnvidia-current, 275.09.07, 3.0.0-5-generic, x86_64: installed\nvirtualbox, 4.0.10, 3.0.0-5-generic, x86_64: installed\n\n$ sudo python dkms.py\n...\n\n$ dkms status\nnvidia-current, 275.09.07, 3.0.0-5-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidia-current, 275.09.07, 3.0-2-generic, x86_64: built\nnvidia-current, 275.09.07, 3.0-3-generic, x86_64: built\nvirtualbox, 4.0.10, 3.0.0-5-generic, x86_64: installed\nvirtualbox, 4.0.10, 3.0-2-generic, x86_64: built\nvirtualbox, 4.0.10, 3.0-3-generic, x86_64: built\n\nIf you also want to install the modules, replace build with install in the second last line.\n\nA: I figured out a shell one-liner to do it:\nls /var/lib/initramfs-tools | \\\n    sudo xargs -n1 /usr/lib/dkms/dkms_autoinstaller start\n\nThis works because the names of the directories in /var/lib/initramfs-tools are exactly the kernel version names that you need to pass to dkms_autoinstaller to tell it to rebuild all modules for those kernel versions. Note that if you have uninstalled some old kernels, their directories might still be lying around and cause some errors to be reported, but this isn't a problem because dkms_autoinstaller will just do nothing for those kernel versions that aren't installed.\n\nA: Combining @htorque and @Ryan Thompson's answers, here's my (as root) one-liner:\ndkms status | sed s/,//g | awk '{print \"-m\",$1,\"-v\",$2}' | while read line; do ls /var/lib/initramfs-tools | xargs -n 1 dkms install $line -k; done\n\n\nA: An edit of script by @htorque.

In Ubuntu 22.04 there's no /var/lib/initramfs-tools directory, however, there're initrd.img-<kernel version> images present in /boot per every installed kernel version, and these <kernel version> are exactly what dkms (and dkms_autoinstaller) needs. So let's use them:\nls /boot/initrd.img-* | cut -d- -f2- | \\\n    sudo xargs -n1 /usr/lib/dkms/dkms_autoinstaller start\n\n\nA: dkms status and dkms_autoinstaller does not work in ubuntu 16.x. So some shell script will do.\nThis script assumed you have proper *-dkms deb-package installed, and bash is your shell.\nfor k in $(ls /var/lib/initramfs-tools) ; do\n for d in $(cd /usr/src; ls -d *-*) ; do\n  [[ -f /usr/src/${d}/dkms.conf ]] || continue\n  m=$(echo $d | sed -r -e 's/-([0-9]).+//')\n  v=$(echo $d | sed -r -e 's/[^0-9]+-([0-9])/\\1/')\n  sudo /usr/sbin/dkms install -c /usr/src/$d/dkms.conf -m $m -v $v -k $k\n done\ndone \n\n", "Q: Suspend/hibernate doesn't work on an Asus laptop I'm having issues suspending Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) on my new Asus U30SD-XA1 laptop. It's a new laptop on the market. Is this a known issue and is there a fix for it?\nBasically, whenever I close or put the laptop to sleep, the screen goes black but the video card doesn't actually turn off, and then the fan spins even faster than before and gets hot.\nI did see that some people were having similar issues on other laptops and they set the kernel back. I'm newish to Ubuntu, and I'm not super comfortable messing with the kernel.\nI am not using the 520M Nvidia driver, because it won't load Unity after it's installed.

I had the laptop (1225B) set to suspend when I closed the lid, which worked. But immediately after suspending, it would resume (with the lid still closed).

When it is not used for awhile (I primarily use keyboard) it turns off.  Fine, so I have to turn it back on by pushing the button.

I have a bluetooth touchpad+keyboard combo that I use with another Ubuntu computer that des not have this issue.  Is there any reason mwhy this might be the case?  It's very annoying.\n\nA: Bluetooth settings are controlled from configuration files in /etc/bluetooth. For input devices we can define a timeout before a connection will be disconnected. To disable this open /etc/bluetooth/input.conf as root in an editor and either comment out the following line by adding # (as it is done in the example below), or set timeout value to 0:\n#IdleTimeout=30\n\n\nOther timeouts that can be set in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf may not be affected in your case as they only play a role when a service may be interrupted (e.g. by bad signal strength) and will not be reconnected in case a timeout is set here. Default values for timeouts in main.conf are:\nDiscoverableTimeout = 0\nPairableTimeout = 0\nPageTimeout = 8192\n\n\nA: I appear to have solved my problem, and perhaps yours as well. After going through troubleshooting steps, here's I what have working now:\n\n\n*\n\n*I commented out AutoConnectTimeout in\n/etc/bluetooth/main.conf -- not set to 0, but commented it out\ncompletely.

I don't want AutoConnectTimeout to time out.\n\n*I set my IdleTimeout in input.conf to 240 minutes, this is a\ncomputer dedicated to watching movies, so can't hurt.\n\n*I set RememberPowered in main.conf to false.\n\n\nI was really wracking my brain on this, fearing I would ultimately have to write an F-ing script to ping my mouse via Bluetooth. However, after trying out different combinations of settings in the input.conf and main.conf files. My eyes rested on the RememberPowered option in main.conf. It was set to true. Wait, I want my computer to remember that my mouse was powered off? I don't want my computer to remember any power-state of any mouse. Just go connect and keep powered and keep connected and keep talking, and I don't care if the mouse isn't listening because I turned it off. So I set that to false. It appears this has solved my problem of my Bluetooth mouse not re-syncing up and re-connecting to input services after a long time of being turned off, with the computer still on.\nI hope this helps you.\nNote: It doesn't matter if you have USB mice or USB keyboards connected to your computer.\n\nA: Check out my answer here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/582035/13903\n\nUninstall/purge blueman-manager or any extra bluetooth software. Go vanilla and just leave the original Ubuntu bluetooth software to rule out any conflicts.\n\n*\n\n*Press the bluetooth mouse's discovery mode.\n\n\n*Open a terminal and type the command hcitool scan\n\n\n*Then paste the first half of your bluetooth address as the OUI.\nSo if your bluetooth mouse's address is AB:CD:EF:GH:IJ:KL\nIt would look like this:\n<device oui=\"AB:CD:EF:\" type=\"mouse\" name=\"Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse\" pin=\"0000\"/>\nInsert that line with the rest of the entries in\n/usr/share/gnome-bluetooth/pin-code-database.xml\n\nThis helps to reconnect mice that may require a pin to pair.\nThis should solve most reconnection issues because Ubuntu doesn't know the PIN when it reconnects. You need to provide it with one (if it needs it default is 0000).\nname isn't required, pin isn't required either. oui is required however. First find out if your mouse needs apin then try this. You can also try without using the name parameter if you don't know it.\n\nA: The setting which helped me was the AutoConnectTimeout in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf file. Originally it was set to 60, after changing that to \n AutoConnectTimeout = 0\n\nthe mouse connects in about 2 seconds after either the notebook or the mouse wake up. This is on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) on MacBook Air with a Logitech bluetooth mouse.\n(The other settings mentioned in the previous answer mostly affect device pairing but won't help in re-establishing a connection with an already paired device.)\n\nA: Always try set up PIN to 0000 first.\nIt helps for me and all problems solved. I had exactly same problem looks as is stated above. I already tried all advices there in all related questions but nothing works. The solution is easier than we think\n(Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Logitech M557 Bluetooth mouse).\n\nA: When you setup mouse in 'Bluetooth New Device Setup' panel.\n\nPush 'PIN Options...'\n\nSelect fixed pin '0000'.\n(Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)\n\nA: It may sound strange but my wireless apple (mac) mouse re-connects on resuming/starting-up ubuntu only when I press few clicks and bang it randomly. Takes a couple of seconds to get connected.\nI have tested this more than 10 times. If I don't bang (click) it doesn't connects upto 3-4 minutes. And on banging (clicking) it connects in less than 5 seconds.\nDon't know if it would work with your mouse too least you could do is try.\nPS: I paired it using hcitool scan.\n", "Q: Mouse clicks after movement I have had a problem since I installed 10.10 on my laptop.  I now run 11.4.\nWhen I move the mouse cursor, it clicks a couple seconds after I come to a rest.  I can move the mouse, throw my hands up in  the air, and the cursor will click where ever it is pointing.  This makes typing a real pain, even typing this the mouse put my text cursor in different places.\nI thought this was a problem with my physical mouse pad, but I used a external usb mouse and I did the same thing.\n\nA: With Assistive Technologies we are able to initiate a mouse click when mouse pointer movements stop. To disable this go to System Settings and open Control Center -> Assistive Technologies:\n\nFrom there choose Mouse Accessibility:\n\nUntick the option \"Initiate click when stopping mouse pointer movement\".\n\nA: For anyone using ubuntu 14.04 or later, i could access that by going to system settings > universal access then click on the Pointing and clicking tab , turn hover click off\n", "Q: Why does my Apache folder show two configuration files? When I cd to /etc/apache2/ I can see two configuration files: apache2.conf and httpd.conf.\nThe apache.conf file has many configuration directives within (that makes me think it's the main configuration file)while the other (httpd.conf) has none(actually, it has just one that I added a while ago...namely ServerName localhost) .\nIs this ok? Can I be sure that any changes made in the apache2.conf file will be effective?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: The apache main configuration happens to apache2.conf. If you go thought the configuration file around line 207 you will realise it includes the httpd.conf. \nThis way you can make your custom configurations in the httd.conf without getting lost in the apache2.conf and you can keep your individual changes to your individual file.\nIt doesn't really matter where you write your configurations since both files are getting used.\nIn order to make sure it works sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart this will restart the Apache server.\n", "Q: Integration for Thunderbird 5?

Is it possible to install the new Ubuntu One control panel in Ubuntu versions 10.04 or 10.10? I referred this page, but it suggests of installing Nightly builds, while I'll prefer to have stable builds.\n\nA: We don't currently build up to date stable version packages for 10.04 or 10.10.  If you want a later version, you'll either have to upgrade to a newer Ubuntu release, or use our nightly releases PPA (which may lead to occasional breakage that you wouldn't see using the versions from the main Ubuntu archives).\n", "Q: How do I sync an external drive using Ubuntu One? At present on my laptop I have a dual boot XP and Ubuntu and from Ubuntu I would like to Sync folders on my XP partition use Ubuntu One but the option is not available when right click on any file or folder in the XP partition. Is it possible to do this and how.\n\nA: Currently the Ubuntu One client only supports synchronising folders found under your home directory.  So you will need to arrange for the files you want to sync to appear somewhere under $HOME.\nThere are two options here:\nMount the file system under /home\nJust create a directory to use as the mount point and update the /etc/fstab file to use that mount point instead.\nCreate a bind mount\nIf you don't want to change the mount point for the file system, you can create a bind mount to make some of the content appear in both locations:\nmount --bind /source/directory /home/user/target\n\nYou should be able to make a bind mount like this permanent by adding an entry to /etc/fstab like:\n/source/directory /home/user/target none bind 0 0\n\nOnce the files appear under your home directory, you should be able to synchronise them with Ubuntu One.\nSince the folder name most likely contains a white space (Ubuntu One), the line in /etc/fstab should go like this:\n/source/directory /home/user/Ubuntu\\040One/target none bind 0 0\nbecause fstab takes \"\\040\" as white space.\n\nA: Not a direct answer to you questions but did you see there is an Ubuntu One program for Windows (beta):\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/Windows\nI dont now how good it works, but maybe you give it a try. When i understand the wiki correctly at present you can only share something inside the U1-folder with Windows. So it is no help for getting something from \"My Documents\" into Ubuntu One.\nBut i would guess the windows client should getting better in the next months.\n\nA: It is very difficult to synchronize external data sources. It is possible to fool Ubuntu One into syncing it, but if you remove that external disk, then Ubuntu One will delete everything from that device from all other computers and from the web. This is what's supposed to happen; if you remove files, then the removal should be synced. \nIn other words, even if it's possible to fool Ubuntu One into doing it, I would strongly advice against it. The likelyhood that you'll get burned is very high. \n", "Q: Java process hangs after exiting Eclipse On my machine whenever I work with Eclipse (on Suns JDK), the java process does not terminate after I exit Eclipse.

I imagine a script to kill the Java processes, but to make some exceptions depending on the command line parameters of the Java process (e.g. I have Subsonic and the Playstation Media Server running all the time).\nWhat are your ideas to automatically (and selectively) kill the Java processes?\n\nA: You describe an old bug in some installations of Eclipse.

I have to click the right mouse button and select the operations from the context menu.\nI thought this problem comes from Unity, so I switch to the classic GNOME session, but this didn't help.\n\nA: Each application is independently responsible for binding keystrokes to specific operations.  While there are conventions (e.g. Ctrl+C is sometimes copy), sometimes different choices are made (e.g. Ctrl+C is sometimes EOT (end of text)).\nApplications that are made for a given desktop environment (e.g. gedit Text Editor for GNOME) are very likely to inherit keybindings for that environment, but applications that use different frameworks (e.g. Netbeans for GNOME) are less likely to do so, although some conventions may be followed (i.e. Ctrl+C is copy for both gedit and Netbeans).\nSome applications or frameworks may support additional keysyms (like XF86Copy for copy in gedit Text Editor (usually a dedicated Copy on the keyboard), whereas others will not (Netbeans ignores XF86Copy).  If you have customised keymappings, or complex input devices with special signals (like Copy), you may need to configure support separately in separate applications.\nIf a specific application does not support some key, and does not offer a way to configure a keybinding for that key, please file a bug requesting support for the appropriate keybinding.\nIf a specific application does not support some key, and does offer a way to configure a keybinding for that key, consider opening a bug to modify the default configuration to support that key, if you believe this would be a common keybinding, to be expected by default.\nIf you have specialised input needs (you do not believe that others will want this keybinding), and the application does not offer a means to configure the keybindings, you might open a bug requesting support for configurable keybindings.\n\nA: I have found  The solution Accidentally.

Sometimes when I suspend my laptop it wakes up instantly, but other times it takes around 5 minutes to wake up - in any case way longer than a cold boot.\nWhile the laptop is waking up I can hear the hard drive working and when my laptop finally does wake up the system load is at 100%. Strangely my memory is half empty (even if it was 3/4 full (not counting cache) when I suspend the laptop) but my swap isn't (I have 4GBs of RAM and this is the only time I see swap not being empty).\nIt seems to me that while waking up my laptop sometimes starts thrashing, but I have no idea what is causing it, how to prevent it or even how to debug it.\nMy laptop is a hp elitebook 8730w.\nEDIT:\nHere is a screenshot of the System Load Indicator when I get to my desktop. There is at least 1.8GB of RAM free but there is 1.4GB in swap, why is that so?\n\n\nA: \"Hibernate\" is suspend to disk\n\"Suspend\" is suspend to RAM\nPower Management hibernates your laptop on low battery even when it was suspended to RAM to prevent data loss.\nUnfortunately waking up from a hibernate state may take longer than a regular boot. If this is the case we may consider shutting down rather than hibernating. However, then running applications will not be restored.\nuswsusp  may speed up wake up from hibernation.\n\nA: When I had this problem with 10.10 I contacted support for my laptop and they said, \"This is a known issue. It should be occurring about once in every three or four suspends.\"  At the time they thought it was fixed in 11.04 and I have not had an issue since upgrading.\nWith a little digging I did find a confirmed bug in 11.04 that may be related.\n\nsystem becomes very slow after suspend/resume My quad core i5 iMac\nbecomes unusably slow after resuming from suspend. One process will\n  take 100% of a CPU (and nothing will run on the other cores).\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/748004\n\nA: I have got the same problem. It consistently occurs when a lot of swap is used at the time of suspend. If I do\n># swapoff -a\n># swapon -a\n\nto completely empty swap space right before suspend, then the wakeup will always be immediate. Can you confirm that?\nIf you put these commands in a pre-suspend script it may work as a quick and dirty workaround. Swapoff will take a long time if you got a lot of things in the swap. But you probably don't mind if your machine is going to work a little longer after you close the lid if that's the price for immediate resume. You have to make sure, though, that you really have enough free RAM before calling swapoff.\nThe workaround is all but elegant and just fights the symptoms. I'll let you know if I find out about the true reason of the problem.\nJust out of interest: I'm using encrypted partitions for both, my file system and swap. Anybody who has this problem does too? I already suspected that the problem may have to do with this.\n\nA: I remember that after a specific amount of time, the computer wakes up from suspend to RAM, and then suspends to disk automatically. This has something to do with power issues and the subsequent possible data loss, but as far as I know, the time is set to a standard amount, so having the laptop plugged in should not affect this behavior.\n", "Q: Boot hangs after \"Checking battery state...\" The boot process of my installation hangs after the Checking battery state... message.

Following the instructions in Best way to cache apt downloads on a LAN?, I've set up a caching proxy in my local network. Since that machine is not always up, I'd like to be able to refresh the sources list and install packages without using that proxy if unavailable.\nI've already read the Acquire group section in the manual page of apt.conf(5), but I couldn't find an option like \"Silent-Fail\".\nAt the moment, sudo apt-get update and related commands fail because no connection could be established. So how do I configure the client so that the proxy is ignored if it's not available?\n\nA: There's now an officially supported way to do this - using the option - Acquire::http::Proxy-Auto-Detect (see apt.conf man page).  Behaviour is similar to the old undocumented Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect (note presence/absence of hyphens in new/old config options), it's largely backwardly compatible, but has been extended...\nI'm in the process of submitted a patch to the apt maintainers to improve the documentation, but since this is unlikely to make it into a version of apt which ships with a distro release for quite a while, I'll include the text of the proposed patch here:\nAcquire::http::Proxy-Auto-Detect can be used to specify an external command to discover the http proxy to use. APT may invoke the command multiple times, and will pass a URI to the command as its first and only parameter. APT expects the command to output the proxy which is to be used to contact the URI in question on its stdout as a single line in the style http://proxy:port/, or the word DIRECT if no proxy should be used. No output indicates that the generic proxy settings should be used.\nNote that auto-detection will not be used for a host if a host-specific proxy configuration is already set via Acquire::http::Proxy::HOST.\nTo diagnose interactions with the external command, set Debug::Acquire::http=yes and/or Debug::Acquire::https=yes e.g using the -o command line parameter.\nNote that is using a pre-release version of apt, versions 1.3~exp2 to 1.3 then there is a bug (likely fixed by 1.3.1) which causes apt to parse the stderr of the external command along with the stdout.\n\nA: /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy:\nAcquire::http::Proxy-Auto-Detect \"/usr/local/bin/apt-proxy-detect.sh\";\n\n/usr/local/bin/apt-proxy-detect.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nIP=192.168.88.1\nPORT=3142\nif nc -w1 -z $IP $PORT; then\n    echo -n \"http://${IP}:${PORT}\"\nelse\n    echo -n \"DIRECT\"\nfi\n\nCommand Line\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs nc to work (sudo apt-get install netcat) if missing.\n\n*Make sure you chmod +x /usr/local/bin/apt-proxy-detect.sh\n\n*Use the full path when specifying the script.\n\n\nHow it works\nIf it can connect to a proxy, it prints the proxy out APT uses that. If it can't, it prints out DIRECT and APT chugs along normally.\nsauce\n\nA: There is an undocumented setting, Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect. This setting should contains the full path to the binary and cannot have arguments. The command should output the proxy to be used (example: http://10.0.0.1:8000).\nGiven the above information, a script could be created that tries a proxy before setting it.

I'm trying to measure the execution time of a process that I call via the command line (i.e., I want to find out how long it takes to for the process to finish). Is there any command that I can add to the command calling the process that will achieve this?\n\nA: Occasionally I find myself needing a stopwatch to count how long it takes for an action like my app booting, in which case many of the solutions here are not useful.\nFor this I like to use sw.\n\nInstall\nwget -q -O - http://git.io/sinister | sh -s -- -u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coryfklein/sw/master/sw\n\nUsage\nsw\n - start a stopwatch from 0, save start time in ~/.sw\nsw [-r|--resume]\n - start a stopwatch from the last saved start time (or current time if no last saved start time exists)\n - \"-r\" stands for --resume\n\n\nA: For a line-by-line delta measurement, try gnomon.\n\nIt is a command line utility, a bit like moreutils's ts, to prepend timestamp information to the standard output of another command. Useful for long-running processes where you'd like a historical record of what's taking so long.\nPiping anything to gnomon will prepend a timestamp to each line, indicating how long that line was the last line in the buffer--that is, how long it took the next line to appear.

I love the Xubuntu 10.04 theme and I want to install it on my Ubuntu 11.04. It's possible to install only the theme? \n\nA: Yes.  If you want all the xubuntu themes and branding, install the xubuntu-artwork package.  Note that this will install the Xubuntu 11.04 themes, if installed on Ubuntu 11.04, etc. (as the repositories all have the same version, regardless of which desktop environment you use).\nBe aware that the Xubuntu themes are tested primarily in the XFCE environment: there may be gaps in the coverage when used in a GNOME environment, although it may also be that it works perfectly.\nIf you are especially attached to the Xubuntu 10.04 theme, and the theme in 11.04 is unsuitable for you, you could potentially forward-port the xubuntu-artwork (and dependency packages) in some private repository (e.g. a PPA).  Note that there may be changes in the theming engines or similar that may affect the work of forward-porting these packages.\n\nA: The specific theme you are looking for is called Albatross it was designed for Xubuntu 9.10 Karmic if you would like a copy of the gtk theme you can download it at the xubuntu-artwork launchpad site here The tar.gz file contains alot of things as well as the them which is located in\n/xubuntu-artwork-0.38/usr/share/themes/Albatross/gtk-2.0/\nhope this helps\nAs Emmet has already explained it was designed to be used with Xubuntu so there is no guarantee it will work with ubuntu but you can try if it doesn't work you can switch back to another theme  \n", "Q: How do I enable webgl in Firefox? I've got Firefox 5 installed on my Ubuntu 11.04 system. I would like to have webgl working, which is not right now: this website just gives me a grey page:\nhttp://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/aquarium/aquarium.html\n\nI've got it working on google-chrome using the nvidia proprietary drivers, so there must be a way to get it to work on the same system in Firefox.\n\nA: It is my understanding that it is already enabled. I have checked the aquarium out with Firefox 5 right now. Works perfect. It was in Firefox 4 that you needed a command to activate WebGL (Although the programs ran horribly). On Firefox 5 WebGL is much better. Not as good as Chrome of course but it is catching it up very fast.\nIf you are still having problems seeing that webpage it is because of a direct problem with your video card. Does your video card support opengl 2.0.\nHere is a mini guid that points from what version the browsers support WebGL and what to do to make it work if it is in Alpha/Beta with the browser: http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation\nIn the Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_4 you can see that in Firefox 4 it got some support for WebGL (But trust me, most WebGL examples from Chrome Labs tested horrible)\nIn the Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Firefox#Version_5.0 you can see that Firefox 5 got more support for WebGL that now actually lets you play most WebGL apps. There are some even that are very tough to support and it supports them like http://www.ro.me/ \"3 Dreams of Black\" which is literally you flying inside a video thats playing cool music.\n\nA: Indeed this seems to be an issue linked to Firefox blocking graphics card drivers:\nI have Kubuntu 11.04 and Firefox 6 and Chromium 12.0.742.112 (90304) Ubuntu 11.04 and \nin FF I get a grey page, in Chromium I get to see some fish. Performance is not very good, I get 16-22fps even with 1 fish.\nUPDATE: actually the number of fish does not seem to link in any way with fps: 1000 fish and I still get 16-22fps. The same is true for any number of fish I set and any perspective.\n\nA: It is the same in Chrome. It is a problem with the code, not your browser or WebGL.\n\nA: This worked for me with Firefox 5 and Ubuntu 11.04, although the aquarium demonstration link you provided ran extremely slowly on my machine, which admittedly isn't set up for gaming or multimedia. YMMV.\n\nA: check about:config webgl and change webgl.force-enabled to true. worked for me to enjoy using the webgl ;-)\n", "Q: Easy to way to get overview of partitions' contents without mounting them manually? Background: I am installing ubuntu on an SSD. I have two other spinning hard drives in my box as well. One of these contain an older install of ubuntu. For some reason Nautilus doesn't auto mount the file systems on the other drives when I am browsing the file system. Maybe it's because I am already at the partitioning step of the installer.\nQuestion: How can I easily check the contents of the file systems before deciding which partition to mount at which mount point. I would for example like to re-use my old /home partition. I would prefer something that requires less manual work than mounting my partitions manually. Earlier when I've run the installation CD it has somehow been able to mount all my partitions automatically. I figured maybe I could activate this script manually if I knew where it was.\n\nA: To get a quick information on an unmounted partition's content it may be a good idea to name them with labels. This will give you not only knowlegde on the content but you will also be able to easily mount them by their label name.\nTo do so either run Gparted, or open Disk Utility from the Das and choose Edit Filesystem Label for labeling of a hard drive or Edit Partition to change the label of a selected partition. \n\nFor a command line option and more details on mounting by label see this answer.\n", "Q: Firefox blocks my nvidia drivers MOZ_GLX_IGNORE_BLACKLIST When I load a WebGL website on Firefox 5 in my Ubuntu 11.04 system, I get a grey screen and a warning on the terminal like this:\n[GLX] your GL driver is currently blocked. If you would like to bypass this, define the MOZ_GLX_IGNORE_BLACKLIST environment variable.\n\nAcceleration works fine on Google Chrome. How can I enable back acceleration for Firefox?\n\nA: I don't know why the driver is on the blacklist, but you can do what's suggested: try running MOZ_GLX_IGNORE_BLACKLIST=1 firefox.\nIf this works, you can modify the .desktop file /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop and change the line\nExec=firefox %u`\n\nto \nExec=env MOZ_GLX_IGNORE_BLACKLIST=1 firefox %u\n\n\nA: Have you installed the proprietary drivers or are you using the default ones that come with Ubuntu. Nouveau for what I know does not support the requirements for WebGL... yet. But if you install for the time being the nvidia Proprietary ones you will get full support. If i may ask, what video card are you using. You only need one that support OpenGL ES 2.0.

I'm running Ubuntu (11.04) and Banshee (up-to-date from the Banshee Team ppa), and I have a 1st gen iPod Touch (version 3.1.3 7E18).\nUp until now I've synced and managed the iPod using my MacBook Pro. However, my music collection has begun to outgrow the MacBook's disk space, so I've been considering my alternatives...\nWhat I've been thinking of doing is moving my entire music collection to my Ubuntu box - which has a much larger hard-drive - and using Banshee to manage my music and sync it to my iPod.\nHowever, I would still like to install and manage Apps on my iPod too, so I presume I will still need to connect the iPod to iTunes on the MacBook occasionally too.\nSo I guess my question is: is it possible to use Ubuntu Banshee to manage music on my iPod and Mac iTunes to manage apps on it, without the two conflicting or otherwise messing up the contents of the iPod?\n(And if so, any suggestions about what options to use in either bits of software would be much appreciated. For example, in iTunes will I need to set music syncing to \"manual\"?)\nThanks in advance,\nthoughton.\n\nA: This might or might not help but this is what i did. When i first bought my IPod Touch and Ipod Shuffle i synced them in Banshee with no problem but for music only. mp3 files. For other stuff i put the touch in itunes on a friends mac. I was afraid of some corrupt error but nothing happened. Ever since i have been doing it in any way i want. Sync with Banshee or when am on my friends Mac i sync them there. No weird stuff has happened. Am using the Banshee ppa.\n\nA: For me I just synced with Banshee (Music only) and then I synced with my iPod touch (32GB 4'th gen) with iTunes for apps and music...no issues or anything....seemed to work just fine without freaking out :) i don't remember any special steps taken though...

But if you just want to start your SSH server and then solve your problem later, here is my fast solution:\nstart-stop-daemon --start --pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid --exec /usr/sbin/sshd -- -p 22\n\nif then you will see error:\nMissing privilege separation directory: /var/run/sshd\n\nthen just create that missing directory, and try above start-stop-daemon command again:\nmkdir /var/run/sshd\nchmod 0755 /var/run/sshd\n\nthat helped me to start my sshd daemon.\n\nA: reconfiguring my firewall to allow port 22 worked for me.\nufw enable\nufw allow 22\n\n\nA: There seem to be 3 issues resulting in this behavior (for my system Ubuntu 14.04LTS):\n1- ssh unknown job occurs when you try to use 'service ssh start' from a 'su'\nsession. Solution is to use sudo service start from a logged in user that can 'sudo'\n2- The existing init.d/ssh script is exiting quietly without actually starting sshd when ssh is on upstart\n3- The main reason ssh does not start is because on Ubuntu 14.04 there is an empty file\n/etc/ssh/sshd_host_not_to_run which indicates that sshd should not run. Just delete that file if you want sshd to run.\nSo overall solution is: Use sudo service ssh start after deleting /etc/ssh/sshd_host_not_to_run\n\nA: Just re-install openssh-server:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall openssh-server\n\n\nA: There's a bug report with a non-kluge solution to this bug\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1811580\ncan be defused by implicitly setting 'UsePrivilegeSeparation no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config,\nre-installing doesn't necessarily fix it.\n", "Q: Which new features and changes are planned for Unity in 11.10?

When going to  launchpad, no blueprints are available and the open bugs are mostly just fixes or backlog from 11.04.\nThat makes me wonder what is planned for unity in 11.10 at all? Is there any public documentation available about this topic? Or could some developers make a statement here?\nIt would undoubtedly be very interesting for many to get some information on this!\n\nA: They'll be distributing it with both Gnome 3 and a slightly-closer-to-ready version of Unity, \nSo, Unity will be able to display progress bars, notifications and little circles with numbers on the fly, like you might see in a Chromium-style plugin. I know, sounds small, but it's something. Third parties will also be able to write their own \"lenses\", which will let you search, for example, Youtube from your desktop -- IE, the search that happens when you hit the super button -- and browse interesting content from there.\nThey're going to integrate the Software Center with Unity a little more, not that I have any idea what that means.\nI found those new features in these article: http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/05/6-important-changes-in-next-ubuntu-1110.html, http://www.junauza.com/2011/05/ubuntu-1110-oneiric-ocelot-features.html. But I'm sure there are a couple more features (mainly focusing on integration) in the works, as well as a nice pile of bug fixes.

This is probably because it your hardware is new, or your libsensors is old (unlikely with 11.04), or maybe different vendors use the sensor for different things, or other reasons.\nI would suggest using the stress or other stress-testing command to put load on certain parts of your system in order to determine what the sensor is for, and then add your own label into sensors.conf, eg.:\nchip \"lm87-*\"\n    label temp1 \"M/B Temp\"\nReplace the lm87-* with your chipset as seen in the output of running sensors from a shell.\n\nA: Check out this webupd8 article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Indicator-Sensors Displays CPU/Motherboard Temperature on the Panel Using an AppIndicator [Ubuntu]\nCurrently you can install the PPA version of indicator-sensors by running the commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexmurray/indicator-sensors\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sensors\n\n(This integrates the updated information about the official PPA into the commands given in that article.)\nThe article provides some information about how to configure it after installing:\n\nOnce installed, launch Indicator-Sensors from Dash (it's called\n  \"Hardware Sensors Indicator\"). Then you'll need to configure it:\n  click the appindicator and select \"Preferences\", then expand the\n  various temperature modules you see in the Preferences dialog and\n  check the box next to the temperature / voltage / fan speed you want\n  to displayed on the panel.\n\n", "Q: How to change the refresh rate at which the network manager updates the wireless access points Sometimes it takes too long for the network manager to update to see new wireless AP. Is it possible to change the time interval between checks?\n\nA: The \"refresh rate\" (scan interval) is hardcoded in the source code of network manager. The interval is some value between 20 and 120 seconds. Some heuristics decide when to scan more often and when less often. There seems to be no way to configure the interval other than patching the source and compiling.\nSee the relevant source file of network manager version 0.9.0 and search for interval.\nThere is a lot of discussion on the internet about allowing users to change the interval. The developers do not want that. They argue that users might set the interval too low and that will cause grievance for all members of the wireless network, not only for the user alone.\nI am sorry I cannot provide you a link to that discussion. I forgot to save the link and now I couldn't find it again. You will have to take my word for it.\nSo it is not possible to configure the refresh rates, and it seems that it will not happen anytime soon.\n\nYou can trigger a scan manually using the following command:\nsudo iwlist eth1 scan\n\nReplace eth1 with the name of your wireless device. Use iwconfig to find out the name of your wireless device.\nYou can list the found networks using nm-tool.\nYou can observe the activity of your wireless device using iwevent.\n\nA: The answer given by lesmana, will not guarantee and immediate connection because it does not change the\npolling interval. The command simply shows a list of\nnetworks already polled at a given time and cached.\nA better solution should be\nsudo service NetworkManager stop\nsudo service NetworkManager start\nThis would immediately refresh all new and available wireless networks.\nHope this helps some-one\n", "Q: What's the difference between the Chromium PPA and the Chromium offered in the Universe Repo? Are there differences between this Chromium PPA (https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/stable) and the one in the Universe repository?\nAre there reasons to choose one over the other? Since the PPA is maintained by Ubuntu developers I assume it's as safe as anything coming from the Universe repository.\n\nA: The PPA package is updated to the most recent version (in the upstream stable line) potentially every day (not every day in practice, because the stable line doesn't update every day).\nThe package in the universe repository is only updated if there's a security issue. Unlike most pacakges, the security updates to the Chromium package bring in fairly recent versions of Chromium, presumably because backporting the security fixes is hard. Still, the universe repository is updated a lot less often, so the PPA gives you a more up-do-date system at the cost of making frequent downloads and system changes (it's less stable, in Debian terms).\n\nA: The main difference is the stable PPA is a straight backport of, usually, the latest packaging and update from the stable channel.  This PPA is provided without any testing.  The Ubuntu archive version gets updated once there is a new security update that has been run through some tests and if there are no major regressions found in the update.  The version in the archive might be using older packaging.  The PPA might also come with some extra translations for the Desktop files.\n", "Q: FN keys F9 - F12 do not work on an Asus U30sd  Using the Keyboard Utility I was able to select the asus layout and after that I was able to get the majority of the function keys to work(screen brightness, wifi, sleep, num lock, and scroll lock).

You have not mentioned any thing about the H/W you are using. Desktop PC or laptop, Graphics card etc.\nOne cause of the shutdown might be over heating.

I've been in the Linux world quite a while now (little more than 10 years), but there are several concepts that I still can't grasp.

This can be done automatically with ssh-copy-id\nIn the event that the private key for a client is compromised, simply remove its public key from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

Either switch to a VTY using Ctrl + Alt + F1 and login as new or login from a terminal using su new. If you chose the first method, you can switch back with Ctrl + Alt + F7. From this point, it's assumed that you're logged in as new.\nIf symbolic links exist which point to their old directories, find those links:\nfind ~ -lname '*/old/*' -ls\n\nThe file names of the symbolic links are printed, but no action has been taken. To create a new symlink ~new/path/to/symlink pointing to ~old/point/to/target, overwriting the old one, run:\nln -sf ~old/point/to/target ~new/path/to/symlink\n\nThere could be configuration files referring to the old ones, you can find those files with grep:\ngrep -HrnI 'old' ~\n\nIf you get many results, consider being more specific, i.e. replace old by /home/old. Files will be listed with lines matching the search criteria, but no action is taken.\nDebugging the old account\nIf you copy all settings and files, you're better off with removing the problematic files. For optimal results, it's a good idea to logout the subject user from a GUI session and log in a virtual console (switch to it using Ctrl + Alt + F1).\nIf you're suddenly being logged out, check ~/.xsession-errors. You can do so by running:\nless ~/.xsession-errors\n\nUse arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home or End to navigate, press Q to quit.\nSometimes the .gconfd/saved_state file gets corrupt. You can remove this file with:\nrm .gconfd/saved_state\n\nAfter doing this, switch back to a GUI login by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F7. Log in and if the problem went away, you're done. Otherwise, log out and switch back to the virtual console using Ctrl + Alt + F1.\nAnother directory that can be emptied is ~/.cache:\nrm -r ~/.cache/*\n\nInstead of loosing all files and settings, temporary move some folders. That can be done with:\nmv folder{,-orig}\n\nIf a folder was not causing issues, remove the newly created folder and restore the old one:\nrm -r folder\nmv folder{-orig,}\n\nSome folders that could cause problems (some may be nonexistent, in that case skip to the next folder):\n.gnome\n.gnome2\n.kde\n.config\n.local\n\nAs with every modification, switch back to a GUI login and test it.\n\nA: Assuming that you have already created your newuser and the home folder for the newuser exists:\n(1/2) Copy all the files to the new user:\nsudo rsync -ah --progress /home/olduser/. /home/newuser\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync is a function similar but generally better than cp.

This option is what migrates your settings.)\n\n\n(2/2) Change the owner of the copied files\nNow we change all the ownerships of the files:\nsudo chown -R --from=olduser:oldusergroup newuser:newusergroup /home/newuser\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*chown is a function to CHange-OWNership of files\n\n*-R makes it recursive. (If you are just changing one file you don't need this but we are changing all files and directories and everything within your new user folder and so recursive is needed)\n\n*--from=olduser:oldusergroup this makes sure that we don't change any files (especially relevant for hidden files) that are 'owned' by root. Changing these could mess up a lot. This --from option tells chown that we only want to change files and folders that are currently owned by olduser.\n\n\nThis worked for me and, although I explained a lot here, actually it's only 2 main commands so the process is really simple once you work out how to keep the permissions etc.\n", "Q: ddclient not working without sudo When I run ddclient (DynamicDns Updator) without sudo, I get\nWARNING:  file /etc/ddclient.conf: Cannot open file '/etc/ddclient.conf'.

It's possible that the uninstall failed and that you didn't finish cleaning up properly; check if there are files /var/lib/dpkg/info/jarnal.*. If the package is installed, there should be a file jarnal.list with the list of files provided with the package. If you're removing a badly formed package manually, you don't need to worry about the other files in /var/lib/dpkg/info.\n\nA: If these are for not-installed packages, simply run sudo dpkg --clear-avail (following this)\n\nA: You can back up the available file and then empty it (leave it there, but empty). \napt-get doesn't need the file at all, dpkg sometimes uses it for reference, but it's not essential and it will populate it again after some time.\nAnother option would be to delete the problematic jarnal entry from the available file manually.\n", "Q: How do I retrieve the public key from a SSH private key?

I am only interested in running the Official Ubuntu images.  How do I now which AMI is the right one?\n\nA: using ruby aws-sdk, you can programatically discover the latest Ubuntu AMI like this\n    ec2 = AWS::EC2.new\n\n    root_device_type = \"ebs\"\n    ami_owner = '099720109477'\n    ami_name = \"*ubuntu/images/#{root_device_type}/ubuntu-precise-12.04*\"  # hardcoded to ubuntu 12.04.

Terminating.\"\n      end\n    end\n\n\nA: You can use https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/ which provide a comprehensive comparison based on version, release date etc. \nSearch for the version, region you want and sort based on release date to get the latest version.\n\nA: The success of Ubuntu as a platform and Ubuntu's commitment to refreshing AMIs means that there are literally thousands of of images on Amazon EC2 with \"ubuntu\"in their name. That, combined with and the lack of Ubuntu on the \"Quick Start\" menu makes selecting the right AMI a non-trivial task.\nSome General Ubuntu Information\nYou already may be aware of these items, but I want to point them out for those who are just getting started with Ubuntu or EC2.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu releases every 6 months. Each release has a version number and a codename. The most important thing to note here is that every 2 years a LTS (Long Term Support) release is made. If you want stability and support for 5 years, select an LTS release. If you want the newest packages, select the most recent release. See the wikipedia entry for more information.\n\n*At the time of this writing, there are 5 \"regions\" in Amazon EC2. Each region represents a geographical location. Each region has its own AMI ids. Inside each region there are 2 architectures (x86_64, i386) and 2 \"root store\" types (EBS or instance). That means that for each build Ubuntu releases, we generate 20 ami ids.\n\nEasiest: Find AMIs From Your Web Browser\nYou can choose your interface for selecting images. Go to either:\n\n*\n\n*https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/\nAt the bottom of this page, you can select the region, release, arch or root-store. You're only shown the most recent releases here. When you've made your selection, you can copy and paste the ami number, or just click on it to go right to the EC2 console launch page for that AMI.\nor\n\n*\n\n*https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/server/releases/\n\n*\n\n*Select Your release by number or code-name\n\n*Select 'release/': We keep historical builds around for debugging, but the 'release/' directory will always be the latest.\n\n*Select your AMI from the table and click to launch in the console or copy and paste a command line.\n\n\n\nSearch through the Amazon EC2 Console\nThe EC2 Console is a graphical way to sort through AMIs and select one to launch. To Launch an Official Ubuntu Image here, follow the steps below.\n\n*\n\n*Select the region you want in the top left, under 'Navigation'\nExample: \"Us East (Virginia)\"\n\n\n*Click \"AMIs\"\nDo not click \"Launch Instance\" [see note below]\n\n\n*for 'Viewing', select \"All Images\"\n\n\n*Limit the results to Ubuntu Stable Release images by typing ubuntu-images/\nYou should expand the 'AMI Name' field as wide as possible (maybe shrink the others).\n\n\n*Limit the results to a specific release by appending '.*'.\nFor example: ubuntu-images/.*10.04\n\n\n*Limit the results to a given arch by appending '.*i386' or '.*amd64'\nNote: If you want to run a m1.small or c1.medium, you need 'i386'. If you want to run a t1.micro, you will need to select an 'ebs' image.\n\n\n*Sort your results by AMI Name and make selection\nBy sorting by AMI name, you can more easily see the newest AMI for a given set. Each AMI ends with a number in the format YYYYMMDD (year,month,day). You want the most recent one.\n\n\n*Verify the Owner is 099720109477!\nAny user can register an AMI under any name. Nothing prevents a malicious user from registering an AMI that would match the search above. So, in order to be safe, you need to verify that the owner of the ami is '099720109477'.\n\n\n*If \"Owner\" is not a column for you, click \"Show/Hide\" at the top right and select \"Owner\" to be shown.\n\n\n*Click on the AMI name, then Click 'Launch'\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*Web Console 'Launch Instance' dialog: I saw no way in the 'Launch Instance' dialog to see the Owner ID. Because if this, I suggest not using that dialog to find \"Community AMIs\". There is simply no way you can reliably know who the owner of the image is from within the console. For advanced users, I will blog sometime soon on a way to find AMIs programmatically [Hint].\n\nSource 1: ubuntu-smoser.blogspot.com\nSource 2: ubuntu.com\n\nA: New and improved version.\n# needed as json list returned by ubuntu site is mal-formed\nremove_last_comma() { sed '\n        $x;$G;/\\(.*\\),/!H;//!{$!d\n    };  $!x;$s//\\1/;s/^\\n//'\n}\n\ncurl -s \"https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/releasesTable\" \\\n    | remove_last_comma \\\n    | jq -c '.aaData[] | select(contains([\"16.04\", \"us-west-2\", \"hvm:ebs\"]))' \\\n    | grep -o 'ami-[a-z0-9]\\+' | head -1\n\nBasically grabs raw data used for ubuntu's ami finding page, and uses jq to parse out the row I want then a grep to pull out the value.

It uses the aws cli tool to query the API, using the fact that the names sort in date order to get the latest.\nname=$(\\\n    aws --region us-west-2 ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \\\n        --filters Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs \\\n            Name=architecture,Values=x86_64 \\\n            Name=name,Values='*hvm-ssd/ubuntu-trusty-14.04*' \\\n    | awk -F ': ' '/\"Name\"/ { print $2 | \"sort\" }' \\\n    | tr -d '\",' | tail -1)\n\nami_id=$(\\\n    aws --region us-west-2 ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \\\n        --filters Name=name,Values=\"$name\" \\\n    | awk -F ': ' '/\"ImageId\"/ { print $2 }' | tr -d '\",')\n\nIt works in 2 parts. The first part gets all the AMIs for ubuntu trusty that meet the various criterion (ebs, x86_64, and the name pattern). It pulls out the Name and sorts by it. The names are formatted so that sorting them sorts by date so the last one will be the newest one. This name is then assigned to the 'name' variable.\nThe second part uses that name to request the AMI ID for the AMI with that name. It parses out just the id and assigns it to 'ami_id'.\n\nA: There is a comprehensive list of available Official AMIs on the Ubuntu Cloud Portal. You an find additional resources regarding Canonical's Official EC2 AMI releases in the Ubuntu Help: EC2 Starts Guide and a raw directory of all the AMIs released by Canonical in Ubuntu EC2 Images\n\nA: I thought it would be useful to demonstrate how to do this using with Ansible by using the ec2_ami_find module.\nAt the time of writing (2017-06-07) in the ap-southeast-2 region AWS will suggest these Ubuntu LTS images if you start an EC2 instance manually from the console:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-96666ff5\n\n*Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-807876e3\nThis is in line with their recommendations to use HVM virtualization and EBS backed SSD Volumes.\n\nFor the best performance, we recommend that you use current generation\n  instance types and HVM AMIs when you launch your instances.\n\nTo get the same AMIs that AWS recommend you can use the following tasks:\n- name: Find the most recent xenial AMI\n  ec2_ami_find:\n    aws_access_key: \"{{ vault_aws_access_key }}\"\n    aws_secret_key: \"{{ vault_aws_secret_key }}\"\n    region: \"{{ config_region }}\"\n    name: \"ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*\"\n    owner: 099720109477 # canonical ownerid\n    virtualization_type: hvm\n    sort: name\n    sort_order: descending\n    sort_end: 2\n  register: ami_find_xenial\n\n- name: Newest Xenial AMI\n  debug:\n    msg: \"{{ ami_find_xenial.results[0].ami_id }}\"\n\n- name: AWS recommend Xenial AMI\n  debug:\n    msg: \"{{ ami_find_xenial.results[1].ami_id }}\"\n\n- name: Find the most recent trusty AMI\n  ec2_ami_find:\n    aws_access_key: \"{{ vault_aws_access_key }}\"\n    aws_secret_key: \"{{ vault_aws_secret_key }}\"\n    region: \"{{ config_region }}\"\n    name: \"ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-trusty-14.04-amd64-server-*\"\n    owner: 099720109477 # canonical ownerid\n    virtualization_type: hvm\n    architecture: x86_64\n    sort: name\n    sort_order: descending\n    sort_end: 3\n  register: ami_find_trusty\n\n- name: Newest Trusty AMI\n  debug:\n    msg: \"{{ ami_find_trusty.results[0].ami_id }}\"\n\n- name: AWS recommend Trusty AMI\n  debug:\n    msg: \"{{ ami_find_trusty.results[2].ami_id }}\"\n\nWhich gives the following output:\nTASK [Load secrets from Vault] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost]\n\nTASK [Find the most recent xenial AMI] *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost]\n\nTASK [Newest Xenial AMI] ***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost] => {\n    \"changed\": false, \n    \"msg\": \"ami-1e01147d\"\n}\n\nTASK [AWS recommended Xenial AMI] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost] => {\n    \"changed\": false, \n    \"msg\": \"ami-96666ff5\"\n}\n\nTASK [Find the most recent trusty AMI] *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost]\n\nTASK [Newest Trusty AMI] ***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost] => {\n    \"changed\": false, \n    \"msg\": \"ami-993e2bfa\"\n}\n\nTASK [AWS recommended Trusty AMI] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nok: [localhost] => {\n    \"changed\": false, \n    \"msg\": \"ami-807876e3\"\n}\n\nIf you compare the AMI ids returned by the playbook you can see AWS do not recommend the latest available image but rather the second or third latest. I don't know what criteria/heuristic they are using here. \n", "Q: GNOME 3 on 11.04: Doesn't work. How to troubleshoot? I installed GNOME 3 on Natty, using the PPA and these instructions. I restarted and tried to log in using Gnome, only to be greeted by a \n\nOh no! Something has gone wrong.\n  A problem has occurred and the system\n  can't recover. Please log out and try again.\n  Log out\n\nIt doesn't give any other details. Where can I access the log or know more about the error or How do I fix the problem?\nSpecs:\nAspire One ZG5\nUbuntu 11.04  \nUpdate:\nI tried this from the instructions here\ncd ~/.config/autostart\nnano gnome-shell.desktop\n\nThen, in the editor, type this:\nCode:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=gnome-shell --replace\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=Gnome Shell\nName=Gnome Shell\nComment[en_US]=\nComment=\n\nWhen I rebooted into GNOME, I did not get the error but I did not get anything else either. Even Unity and Unity 2D failed to load. So, I re-edited gnome-shell.desktop and removed all text. Now when I log in to GNOME, I get the wallpaper and nothing else. I can log in to Unity and Unity 2D though. Also, I have a problem with running software-sources-gtk on the same system. Is it related?\nHow do I change my video drivers to open source ones? I did not install any drivers while installing Ubuntu, so the drivers are provided by Ubuntu. \nVideo driver: \n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GME\n  Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)\n\nAfter updating to GNOME 3, my system settings folder has changed. I do not have a Hardware Drivers option now. How do I update / change my video drivers?\n\nA: Open a tty, stop gdm (sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop) (if you are using it) and start X (startx) from the tty. It may give you more info about what is happening. Probably it's a driver problem.\nAnother thing you could try is logging as a different (new) user. Maybe there is some config conflict around. If you are using ATI video card, then shift to open source drivers, because actually G3 is not compatible in almost every case with fglrx.\n", "Q: Memory cache still load, after close programs It's show on system indicator, I found solution in ubuntuforum to use command sudo echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches \nIt's work, but why my ubuntu not handle by itself?\n\nA: The cache has nothing to do with running programs.  The cache is memory that is otherwise unused, so it is instead used to hold recently accessed data from the disk, in case it is needed again.  This speeds up disk access by avoiding much of it since the data is already in ram.  This is a good thing as it speeds up the system essentially for free, since that ram would otherwise be going to waste.  Dropping the cache, therefore, is a bad idea except for doing cold cache performance benchmarking.\nYou can count memory used by the cache as free, which is why the free program prints a line with the cache added to the free count and subtracted from the used count.\n", "Q: How can I prevent eyestrain? I can use a Windows machine for 10 hours straight without the slightest problem, but after around 15-30 minutes of using ubuntu my eyes become sore and dried out.\nI currently have 11.04 installed with a dual-boot Windows XP. Same hardware, eyestrain only with ubuntu.\nI've also tried different versions of ubuntu on two different machines. Same eyestrain problem. I've tried combinations of fonts and font rendering and installed the microsoft fonts, although I'm not sure it is related to the fonts anyway because I think the fonts look quite nice.\nxrandr shows the monitor refresh rate set at 60hz (the only option for my laptop lcd). \nIs there anything else I can try? I'd like to use ubuntu, not windows...\n\nA: Eye strain is caused in most cases, by tiredness of the ocular muscles. There's a lot of hype that has been spread about various kind of screens, eye drops, blue light lenses etc. But I've found that most of that is just marketing hype. The right way to cure the strain is to not try and treat the symptoms. You have to get to the root cause. I've found this article to be rather insightful and sensible. It highlights for the need for following three solutions to get rid of eye strain over a period of many months.\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you get 8 hours uninterrupted sleep each night.\n\n\n*Close your eyes and relax your face muscles and neck muscles for a\nfew minutes after 20 minutes of computer use.\n\n\n*Ensure you get a well balanced diet of properly cooked food.\nEspecially proteins (for the eye muscles).\nIn terms of software to assist you in doing this, there's Workrave and Redshift.\n\nA: If you work at night you can try using redshift. This adjusts the color temperature of your screen so that it get's more redish the later it is. Of course this doesn't really help explain the difference between Windows and Ubuntu but it does reduce stain.\nDo \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonls/redshift-ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install redshift\nto install it. There are other programs that do just the same thing as well.\nThere's also an older version in the repos so sudo apt-get install redshift will suffice.\n\nA: For anyone interested this answer might provide solution to eye strain problem on various Linux distro with LCD displays:\nLaptop screen causes eye strain on all linux distros except Ubuntu and elementary OS\n\nI already found what the problem is. LCD displays uses a frequency known as PWM (Pulse widht modulation). The screen backlight flashes to this frequency, on most monitors is between 200hz - 500hz range.\nMy Linux distro sets a low PWM frequency by default, that's why all the eyestrain. Luckily Intel gpu drivers can change the PWM frequency.\nYou need to install intel-gpu-tools\nFirst you need to know your reference clock, this is stored on address 0xC6204. You can read values with the command intel_reg_read, so to read the value you can use the command:\n\nintel_reg_read 0xC6204\n\n\nOnce you know your reference clock you can use the calculator on this page to calculate your desired value. I used 500mhz, so I got 0x7a107a1.\nThe address for the PWM value is 0xC8254, You can set values with intel_reg_write, so you can use:\n\nintel_reg_write 0xC8254 0x7a107a1\n\n\nYou can see immediately changes. (Sometimes the screen brightness could change, but this is ok, the PWM frequency changes also)\nI hope that this info could be helpful to anyone who need it.\n\n\nA: It may looks rediculous, but I suggest using sharp fonts. It can be a particular perception of smoothed (read 'fuzzy') fonts by your eyes.\nYou may find instructions of how to install sharp fonts here: Script to install sharp fonts \nGood luck and repose for your eyes :)\n\nA: I cannot solve your issue. However, I have a similar problem and knowing about this might help you.\nOn a HP 2230s laptop (matte display, intel graphics), the screen flickers when using Linux and the display is dimmed. Whether the flickering is noticed depends strongly on colours, green background is horrible. I don't always notice the flicker. Some people never see it.\nUsing the preinstalled Windows Vista, there is no such flicker. At full brightness, the display is fine for me (with Linux).\nThis effect does not appear to depend on the Linux distribution or version as long as the brightness control works.\nPlease, document this issue as good as you can. Contact the manufacturer. File a bug against your distribution. Ask friends to describe the quality of your display.\n\nA: Try different font rendering in System>Preferences>Appearance tab Fonts. For the same font, different subpixel hinting can have a huge impact on how the font is percieved. If you have an LCD screen, open Details and try different Hinting to see which works best for you. I like \"Slight\".\nThe effect on text in Firefox 3 is different from the effect on the rest of the desktop. Restart Firefox after changing Hinting.\n\nA: I've found that I suffer from this (especially early in the morning or late at night). The solution I used was f.lux by Michael and Lorna Herf included with the f.lux indicator applet by Kilian Valkhof\nInstallation:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kilian/f.lux\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fluxgui\n\nConfiguration:\nLaunch the f.lux indicator applet and enter your latitude and optionally your longitude. In the U.S.A. you can simply use your zip code. \n\nConclusion:\nYou'll note that I've chosen to autostart the applet at boot. I've also chosen 2700k as my nighttime color temp as the default was a bit much for my eyes this morning. flux makes the color temperature of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.\n\nA: this functionality has been added for ubuntu 17.10 and later\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/10/enable-night-light-mode-on-ubuntu\n", "Q: Proper Method of Creating Daily-Building PPAs \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to prepare autoupdating PPA? \n\nIs there a proper method that works to create a daily automatic build of a PPA in Launchpad?

Can anyone please help me install Minecraft on Ubuntu 10.04?\n\nA: First, make sure you have Sun JAVA installed.  Installing the JDK or the JRE is a sufficient way of doing this.  The JDK might be best.

I am trying to use the broadcom brcm80211 drivers along with a BCM4313 chip and aircrack-ng suite of programs but airodump only ever lists clients for WEP protected access points. I have setup a WPA2 router and connected another device to it so I know there is definately a client but I never pick it up. Can anyone offer any advice?\nsadly there is alot of junk relating to getting this chipset functioning even in a basic way with linux so if you google it you will get hits relating to propietary drivers, b43 legacy and also kernel source which is what currently is in use.

There are other testing softwares like Backtrack which include a lot of patches already or Metasploit. Anyway with this is enough to determine if you need to patch or not.

The script requires python-wnck and python-gtk to be installed in order to work, although I think these are installed by default anyway.\nCopy and paste this into a text editor and save it somewhere (eg ~/.maximised-firefox.py):\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nfirefox = subprocess.Popen([\"firefox\"])\n\nb = True\nwhile b:\n    screen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n    while gtk.events_pending():\n        gtk.main_iteration()\n    windows = screen.get_windows()\n    for w in windows:\n        if w.get_pid() == firefox.pid:\n            w.maximize()\n            b = False\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\nfirefox.wait()\n\nThen make this executable and copy to a system wide location by opening a terminal and running:\nchmod +x ~/.maximised-firefox.py\nsudo cp ~/.maximised-firefox.py /usr/bin/maximised-firefox\n\nYou can then, using your grandma's profile, edit the menus using the menu editor. You can get to this from the right click menu of the menu or by running alacarte.\nThen edit the firefox item and set the command to maximised-firefox.\n\n", "Q: Can't play Steel Storm, Burning Retribution I've bougth Steel Storm, Burning Retribution in the Software Center, and every time I run it shows the following message:\nYou have reached this menu due to missing or unlocable content/data\nYou may consider adding\n-base dir /path/to/game\nto your launch commandline\nI've gone to main menu in the preferences tab and changed the launcher to no avail.\nI've tried running it from console, with  /opt/steelstorm-episode2/steelstorm, I got:\nGame is Steel-Storm using base gamedir gamedata\nSteel-Storm Linux 01:07:07 Jun 11 2011 - release\nPlaying shareware version.\nSkeletal animation uses SSE code path\nDPSOFTRAST available (SSE2 instructions detected)\nFailed to init SDL joystick subsystem:\ncouldn't exec quake.rc\ncouldn't exec default.cfg\nexecing config.cfg\ncouldn't exec autoexec.cfg\nClient using an automatically assigned port\nClient opened a socket on address 0.0.0.0:0\nClient opened a socket on address [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]:0\nLinked against SDL version 1.2.12\nUsing SDL library version 1.2.14\nGL_VENDOR: NVIDIA Corporation\nGL_RENDERER: GeForce 6150SE nForce 430/PCI/SSE2/3DNOW!\nGL_VERSION: 2.1.2 NVIDIA 270.41.06\nvid.support.arb_multisample 1\nvid.mode.samples 0\nvid.support.gl20shaders 1\nVideo Mode: fullscreen 640x480x32x0.00hz\nS_Startup: initializing sound output format: 48000Hz, 16 bit, 2 channels...\nWanted audio Specification:\n    Channels  : 2\n    Format    : 0x8010\n    Frequency : 48000\n    Samples   : 2048\nObtained audio specification:\n    Channels  : 2\n    Format    : 0x8010\n    Frequency : 48000\n    Samples   : 1024\nSound format: 48000Hz, 2 channels, 16 bits per sample\nCDAudio_Init: No CD in player.\nCan't get initial CD volume\nCD Audio Initialized\n\nIf I try -base /opt/steelstorm-episode2/steelstorm says \"command not found\".\n\nA: diagnosis\nThe error message in the question gives a clue.\nGame is Steel-Storm using base gamedir gamedata\ncouldn't exec quake.rc\ncouldn't exec default.cfg\nexecing config.cfg\ncouldn't exec autoexec.cfg\n\nSteelstorm cannot figure out where the correct base-directory containing the files above.\nsolution\nFortunately Steelstorm has a parameter which can specify this base-directory\nTo start the application from the command line you should use the following format:\n/opt/steelstorm-episode2/steelstorm -basedir /opt/steelstorm-episode2/\n\nsource, post #31\nAlternatively, edit the Steel-storm menu option - changing the command line to the above.\nFor natty you can start the menu application by typing alacarte or using the dash and searching for main menu.\nIf you do not have alacarte installed - you can install this via:\nalacarte \n", "Q: Sound in VLC is out of sync After a minute or so all my sounds in different videos and formats gets late.\nI've tried to reinstall VLC but it didn't help. \nPlease help I can't play any videos because of that. \nIt's late about 1-2 seconds.\nAll of the videos work perfectly in movie player!\n\nA: VLC and audio lag issues are perhaps more common than they really should be.

I've decided to reinstall Ubuntu (11.04). I need to do so from the command line. And, while I am reinstalling to clean up and solve some general, confusing problems, I'd still prefer to keep preferences like Keyboard Shortcuts if possible. Is there some magic wand to reinstall like there was with upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04? If I have to back things up on my own, what's a good way to do so from the command line? Are there any other tips you might give me based on the problem I described in the above thread? Finally, do keep in mind that Ubuntu is one of multiple partitions on my machine.\nI suppose the main question here is, what is the easiest way to reinstall from the command line? I obviously have my own particular sub-questions here, but, for the sake of the community, a generalized answer will, at least, earn you an up vote from me. I suppose the ideal answer would have one big line with the simple command at the top, and details for my situation somewhere under that.\n\nA: So, the answer to the main question:\nYou can't.\n\nA: You can backup by doing things like\n#cd to flash drive\ntar -cvvf home.tar /home\ntar -cvvf etc.tar /etc\n\n\nA: IMHO, you cannot doing any re-installation process without removing command line system. But if you want to do preserve your settings, you can back your home folder up. Most Linux configuration files store in the . (dot) folders which is hidden by default. \nFor your system configuration you may back the /etc directory up. And for backing up your application you can use these command:\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > /home/<username>/applicationlist.txt\n\nCopy that text file to your media backup. When you have completed new installation, you can fire up your terminal and do this:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections /path/to/applicationlist.txt && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Finding all 11.04 compatible printers?

However, I have been the only Ubuntu users among my physical circles (I get to know a lot of other users online). Recently, I have been able to convert my girlfriend to use Ubuntu as well and she loves it a lot.\nI have been thinking of setting up my own small home office. I would have 2 laptops (1 of mine, 1 of my girlfriend's) and a small server (just converted from a desktop). I also have a wireless router modem which will connect with the laptops through wireless and connect with the server through cable. I am thinking on the best solution to solve this setup.\nBasically, what I want to achieve would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*A network which will allow internal file sharing.\n\n*A server which can be accessed from the Internet (out of my home).\n\n\nSo, any suggestion?\n\nA: Three ways to do this from where I stand.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup the server as the external facing router. Will require two nics, but will give your server external face to the internet. (more complicated, not going to recommend unless you have a specific reason)\n\n*Use the DMZ feature of your router to open all ports to the server.\n\n*Open each port as required. This is the best option as you won't have to worry too much about securing your server.\n\n\nOf course, you'd install samba or configure iptables as necessary.\n\nA: As you have only Linux computers in your internal network (two Ubuntu laptops and a Ubuntu Server), you need not install Samba. Of course, you will need to have a static IP if you want to access your server over the Internet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install open-ssh servers on each on the three machines. This will allow you to share files via sshfs. You can use this guide to set it up: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS. Make sure that you use different ports for each machine (i.e., do not use the default port). You can use the GUI tool 'Connect to Server...' from the Places Menu and get access to the files on the remote machine(s). edit: I had earlier suggested ftp using TLS, but it takes more steps to set up than sshfs. Thanks to Wolfy for the suggestion.\n\n*Install open-ssh server on your Ubuntu server, if you have not done so already. This will allow you to control your server remotely. Again, make sure that you use a different port here, other that the default port. Now, set your router to forward this ssh port number to your server. Now, you can connect to your Ubuntu server using your static IP address and the ssh port number of your server.\n\n*In case your office also needs a printer, you can either have a network printer (one that is directly connected to the router) or a shared printer that is connected to your server. Either way, Ubuntu has guides:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/cups.html\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/printing/C/printing.html\nNote: I suggest that you use Ubuntu 10.04 Server as it has Long Term Support (LTS - up to 2015). So, once setup, you will not have to touch it till 2015, by which time you should upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: I'll tell you my configuration. I think it could be useful to you.\nOn LAN I have an Ubuntu server, 2 desktops, 2 laptops, 3 virtual machines which are run on the server.\nOn server I have NFS (network file system) which enables me to share all the data across the machines. That is I have a couple of large hard drives on server machine.\nI think that NFS is a better solution than FTP since you can mount folders/drives from server on your local machines, you could also store home directories on server through NFS (but it's slower than if you have home dir locally).\nIf you need more machines, it's a good idea to create virtual machines through Virtualbox or some other virtualization solution that can run on a server without GUI. I think that Virtualbox is very easy to setup, for example, you could add Windows machine, web server, and some Desktop that would be accessible from remote. You'd have an easy access to all the machines from any other computer in LAN since they can be set as part of LAN.\nYou could also use server as firewall/gateway to other machines if you connect one NIC to router that gives you public IP, and other NIC to some other router/switch with local IPs. Than you'd need to route traffic to other machines by setting up iptables.\nWhat would even be better as a firewall solution, if you have some low power box, pfsense, you could put pfSense in front of your LAN and you could configure everything through web interface of this powerful firewall.\n\nA: There have been a lot of good answers already, but I thought I would add a couple of thoughts more toward securing your setup for external access.\nI don't like having any of my machine directly on the external internet.  It provides too much exposure to problems, even if they are locked down.  That includes most port forwarding.\nInstead, I would set up my router to be an OpenVPN server.  How you do it depends on your router, but for many of the current ones, there are ports of DD-WRT that have OpenVPN.  [I personally like the Tomato port patched for OpenVPN: TomatoVPN, particularly since it has a nice GUI web interface.]  Most of these packages also support automatic updates to services like DynDNS so you eliminate the need for a static IP address.\nOne of the advantage of running a VPN is you get an environment where you are just \"extending\" your existing network.  Unless you have the keys to the VPN, you can't get in.  If you do have the keys, it will look just like you are on your home network.  Also, if setup correctly on your laptop, you can route all of your IP traffic through your home router, thus significantly reducing the chance of having your communications intercepted on a public WAN.\n[BTW, it is suggested you change you setup your router to give out another set of IPs other than 192.168.1.x.  Why?  Because you want to avoid IP conflicts from other routers you might use when away and your home LAN.  Just replace the \".1.\" with some number of your choice.  Look here for IP ranges to use.]\n", "Q: Give apache permission to write to /home/*/www/ directories LAMP server newbie here:\nI have a web server (on a VPS that I have full root access to), in which I'm setting up a few users with websites for.\nI have apache2 and php set up, and I have manually specified a few sites for them under the /etc/apache2/sites-enables directory (symlinking them from sites-available, as per normal).\nI don't actually use the /var/www/ directory, instead opting for the following sort of set up:\n/home/user1/www/websiteone.com/\n/home/user1/www/subdomain.websiteone.com/\n/home/user1/www/differentwebsiteone.com/\n/home/user2/www/websitetwo.com/\n/home/user3/www/websitethree.com/\n\netc, etc, etc. I hope you can see where I'm getting at.\nI have two issues though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache cannot write to these directories. Is there a simple, clear\nexplanation on how I can achieve this for all /home/*/www/\ndirectories ONLY (and recursively) to be writable by www-data,\nwithout giving user1 write access to user2 and so on? A simple step\nthat retroactively works on all future users is preferred, but I\ndon't mind manually setting it up should it be impossible.\n\n*Secondly: In some cases, I would like, say, user2 to have access to\nthe differentwebsiteone.com files (in user1's home directory), but\nnot give them access to anything else (so, some sort of symlink\nappears as /home/user2/www/differentwebsiteone.com). Can I achieve\nthis easily? Maybe moving the site files to /var/www/ and symlinking\nto their respective home directories? Or something? Advice is much\nappreciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: Apache runs as a single user for all sites, so if you gave it access to write to /home/user1/www , user2 would also be able to write PHP scripts that can write to /home/user1/www. You need to run PHP outside of the normal methods to be able to separate users.\nThere's a good write up here on the merits of the various methods:\nhttp://boomshadow.net/tech/php-handlers/\nI like fastcgi myself, but if you don't need performance, suPHP is probably what you want.\nAnother interesting new one not mentioned there is LXC containers, which really weren't all that usable in 10.04, but since then have matured quite a bit. This allows you to create what looks like another server inside your VPS, but its not virtualized.. its just contained within its own process space.\n", "Q: What differences do I need to know choosing between ext4 and NTFS (Performance etc) I understand that ext4 if faster than NTFS. But whats the speed difference if its like < 20MB/s, perhaps its better to use NTFS for convinence? What are the other implications of this apart from performance?\n\nA: Here is a very comprehensive Comparison of file systems.\nNTFS has both read and write access now in Linux through NTFS-3G, and you can use third-party programs to gain access to an EXT2/3/4 filesystem from within a Windows operating system.\n\nA: What I do on my 500g drive is 200 Gig is ext4 300 Gig is Ntfs so what i want to share with my Windows Systems are on the 300 Gig partition. Then I just share the folders that i want the Windows Systems to see over the network. Besides its a good ideal to have a Storage Partition in case if you need to reformat and your data you wanna keep is already backed up. As long as the drive its self doesn't die your good.\n\nA: I think it's relative, and I also think the best way it's to run some small tests on your own system.\nI will always recommend to use a native file system, but if you plan to share the file system, then performance it's on second place.\n", "Q: PHP Mail function and Sendmail I'm trying to get the PHP mail() function to work.

Is there an easier alternative?.\nFinally if you are looking for more exotic choices you can take a look on alternativeto.\n\nA: Some alternatives to GRUB would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*BURG = Brand-new Universal loadeR from GRUB\n\n*GAG = initials in spanish of Graphical Boot Manager\n\n*LILO = LInux LOader\n\n*Syslinux = lightweight bootloaders for MS-DOS FAT filesystems and Linux ext2/ext3/ext4 or btrfs filesystems (EXTLINUX)\nIf you're having problems with GRUB, I would recommend staying away from grapical bootloaders like BURG and GAG but you can try them all to see which fits your needs.\n\nA: I coded grub-smart, which makes GRUB to automatically figure out its optimal configuration.\n", "Q: Making Ctrl+C copy text in gnome-terminal? Is it possible for me to make Ctrl+C perform a copy command if there is highlighted text in the terminal?\nOtherwise, it should retain its normal behavior.\n(If there is a terminal that can do this other than gnome-terminal, that's probably fine too.)\n\nA: You can change the keybinding for Cut and Paste from the default Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+Shift+V to what you say, namely Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, in the Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts menu. Though you should also change the default terminal meaning associated with Ctrl+C (interrupt), for example in this way\nstty intr ^J\n\n(I chose Ctrl+J because I don't remember it is associate with some action, but you can make your own choice.)\nI don't think it is possible to retain the default interrupt action for Ctrl+C only when there is no text highlighted.\n\nA: Ctrl + C is already assigned to another command, which is the one that interrupts the program that is running in the terminal \nFor example, ping www.google.com will start pinging Google until you tell it to stop. The way you do it, is by pressing Ctrl + C\nSo, they couldn't just change the assignment of that combination.\nHighlight the text you want to copy, press Ctrl + Shift + C and it is copied to the clipboard. Ctrl + Shift + V and you paste it.\nLet me know if it doesn't work...\n\nA: As already noted, Ctrl + C is typically used for interrupting a program. But instead of using Ctrl + Shift + C to copy, which I do much more frequently than interrupting a process, I change the setting to have Ctrl + C to copy and Ctrl + Shift + C to interrupt. \nYou can do this in GNOME Terminal by going to \"Edit\" -> \"Keyboard Shortcuts...\" and map the \"Copy\" action to Ctrl + C and \"Paste\" to Ctrl + V. The interrupt command will automatically be remapped to Ctrl + Shift + C.\n\nA: To make cut and paste (Ctrl+V, Ctrl+C) work in the console or terminal, put the following code into terminal to change the key bindings automatically:\ngconftool-2 -t str -s /apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings/copy \"<Control>c\"\n\ngconftool-2 -t str -s /apps/gnome-terminal/keybindings/paste \"<Control>v\"\n\n\nA: Apart from what @Dan said, there's another option for copy-pasting text in Linux, which I'm finding much faster and easier to use, since there's no need to switch from mouse (which you're using to make the selection) to keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*selecting text with mouse copies it to clipboard\n\n*middle-click pastes it.\n\nThis feature is especially useful in terminal, for example when assembling a command from bits of text which are already on screen.\nThis works in all applications, so it's possible to copy-paste text from a web page to terminal etc.\nThe clipboard buffer used for middle-click copy-paste is separate from the one used for Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, which makes it possible to have two different bits of text copied at the same time.\n\nA: Is someone wanted you could use:\n> stty intr ^K         # free Ctrl+C for copy use Ctrl+K instead\n> stty lnext ^-        # free Ctrl+V for paste use ^- instead\n> stty -g\n> stty -g > ~/.stty    # store the settings in home directory\n\nAdd the following to ~/.bashrc\ncase $- in\n *i*)\n   stty `cat ~/.stty`     #  reload the stored stty settings\n   bind -u quoted-insert  #  unbind the quoted-insert function of bash - free Ctrl+V for paste\nesac\n\nAnd then gconf editor or somesuch to change terminals keybindings to CTRL+C for Copy and CTRL+V for paste.\n\nA: Sorry for writing an answer on this, it looks like I spent too much of my reputation on a bounty for being able to post a comment.\nThere is no way to change the behavior of keyboard shortcuts depending on whether there is a text selection or not, and I would avoid reassigning the terminal's Ctrl-C.\nBUT, you can easily get accustomed to\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Ins for copying\n\n*Shift+Ins for pasting\n\n\nThis works practically everywhere (except in Nautilus, sigh), and hardly ever interfers with anything!\n\nA: As already stated, Ctrl+C won't work because of the interrupt usage, but I just figured out a way that worked for me. My goal was to have to press only two keys, not three, and preferably something I'm used to, and not in a too inconvenient place on the keyboard.\nThe keyboard I have on my Linux box has a \"Windows\" key, in the same place as the \"Command\" key on a Mac. So I just went to Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts and I changed the shortcuts to use this key, so it now says Super+C and Super+V. I sometimes use a Mac too, so this was easy to get used to.\n\nA: in Lxterminal (default terminal in Lxde ), you can fully customize shortcuts:\n\n\nA: I think that you cannot because in gnome terminal Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V do not work.\nFor cutting, copying and pasting you have to highlight the text, right click and choose the action you want to do\n\nA: On terminator you can change the bindings by doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*right-click on the terminal screen. Select Preferences.\n\n*Go to Keybindings.\n\n*double-click on the command set for Copy (Ctrl+Shift+C by default) and then press Ctrl+C on keyboard.\n\n*The Copy command is changed. Repeat for the Paste command.\n\n*Exit Preferences.\n\nNow you can use normal Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste respectively.\n", "Q: installing programs from the bash script I wish to install a large number of programs from the software center on all my 8 machines. Installing each program individually would be time consuming so I decided to write a bash script for installing all these programs in 1 go.

Continue [Y/n] ? Every time I have to select Y(yes) myself. \nIs there some way in which I can override this confirming mechanism so that I don't have to press y everytime?\n\nA: First of all, you can use\nsudo apt-get install pkg1 pkg2 ... pkg3\n\nand next, with the option -y, apt-get will not ask for confirmation.\n\nA: The yes command is useful here\nyes | ./install_script.sh\n\n", "Q: Disk partitioning I have done a few Linux installation previously. So far, I think this disk partition scheme works the best for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*/ – 10GB\n\n*swap – 2 x RAM size\n\n*/home – rest\n\n\nThis is great for me while distro hopping. I can wipe the / partition easily and re-use the /home partition.\nSo what is your favourite disk partition scheme? Anyone using LVM (Logicial Volume Manager) in Ubuntu? Just want to collect more ideas for reference in future.\n\nA: There is no \"best\" partitioning scheme. It really depends on your usage. E.g. if you're running a MySQL database, you might want to create a dedicated /var/lib/mysql partition for it.\n10GB swap seems excessive and only useful if you need hibernation. 1xRAM + 2GB = 7G looks enough to me. The 2GB is actually used for swapping. You can lower it even more if you do not need swapping.\nI've considered LVM for a regular system, but it's not worth it. Even if you can save space by it (by increasing/ decreasing logical volumes), recovery on mechanical failure/ power loss/ crash may be harder. If you've a big disk which will be unused for the big part, stay away from LVM since you do not need the extra space.\nThe only reason why you want to use LVM is in conjunction with LUKS (cryptsetup; a way to encrypt a partition). Since a LVM partition can hold more partitions, it'd save you from entering a passphrase for each partition because one LVM partition is encrypted, not the logical partitions in it. Of course, this advantage will only be available if you've a setup like \"disk - LUKS - LVM - partition\" and not \"disk - LVM - LUKS - partition\".\n\nA: When running multiple distributions and/or frequently changing them, or otherwise frequently manipulating partitions, I recommend LVM.  See the wiki entry on the subject.\n", "Q: Grub prompt after upgrade to 11.04 I realize that there are a lot of information on here/Google about this, but I think my problem is different.\n\nI upgraded 9.10 -> 10.04 -> 10.10 -> 11.04. 11.04 failed and I was stuck at the grub prompt.

I didn't pay all that much attention to my battery life as I think I was plugged in. Has anyone taken notice of the resource consumption of the two rendering methods?\n\nA: I havent found anyone who has done a direct Mutter vs Compiz resource usage study.\nIts arguable that Phoronix has done the closest to this looking recently at performance comparison between gnome-shell (Mutter), unity (compiz) & KWin using both NVIDIA and ATI graphics.\nMy reading of the results - and making the assumption that better performance is equivalent to less resource usage for the same work - is that gnome-shell and unity were perhaps equally resource hungry when using NVIDIA drivers, whereas gnome-shell using ATI was more resource hungry than Unity.  \nHowever, KWin was better than both gnome-shell and unity.\nUsual caveats should apply when trying to interpret Phoronix results & methodologies - arguments should be directed to the Phoronix forums!\n", "Q: How to create debuginfo package?

Nothing in /proc takes up any space on the disk.  You need to look elsewhere for what is taking up space.  The same goes for /sys, and /dev.\n\nA: You need to look for large files in /home(this contains all users' home directories) ad delete them. If you have trouble due to the kernel or sudo rm not allowing this, try using a LiveCD, mounting your partition that contains /home and deleting the files that way. Also, if you use the Live CD, you can use Baobab(Accessories>Disk Usage Analyzer) to help track down the offending file.

You can pass necessary information, like the line number and the exit status to your error handler function.\nExample:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhandle_error() {\n    echo \"FAILED: line $1, exit code $2\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\ntrap 'handle_error $LINENO $?' ERR \n\n# your commands here\n# ...\n\necho \"OK\"\n\n\nA: The below script will define the recordfailure function which should be prepended to commands as shown in the example after the function definition. If the command returns non-zero, the standard error stream is logged. Finally, on the end, the error log is checked and [OK] or [FAIL] is printed accordingly.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Redirect file descriptor #3 to standard output (used in recordfailure)\nexec 3>&1\n\n# create an array for holding failures\ndeclare -a failures\n\n# recordfailure command arg1 arg2 ... argN\nrecordfailure() {\n    local error retval\n    # Run the command and store error messages (output to the standard error\n    # stream in $error, but send regular output to file descriptor 3 which\n    # redirects to standard output\n    error=\"$(\"$@\" 2>&1 >&3)\"\n    retval=$?\n    # if the command failed (returned a non-zero exit code)\n    if [ $retval -gt 0 ]; then\n        if [ -z \"$error\" ]; then\n            # create an error message if there was none\n            error=\"Command failed with exit code $retval\"\n        fi\n        # uncomment if you want the command in the error message\n        #error=\"Command $* failed: $error\"\n\n        # append the error to $failures, ${#failures[@]} is the length of\n        # the array and since array start at index 0, a new item is created\n        failures[${#failures[@]}]=\"$error\"\n        # uncomment if you want to show the error immediately\n        #echo \"$error\"\n    fi\n}\nrecordfailure iptables -A FORWARD ...\nrecordfailure iptables -A FORWARD ...\n# if the length of the failures array equals 0 (no items) everything is OK\nif [ ${#failures[@]} -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"[OK]\"\nelse\n    echo \"[FAIL]\"\n    # list every error\n    for failure in \"${failures[@]}\"; do\n        # optionally color it, format it or whatever you want to do with it\n        echo \"error: $failure\"\n    done\nfi\n\nIf you've no desire for showing standard output, remove exec 3>&1 and replace >&3 by >/dev/null.\n\nA: You mean something like this?\nok=1\n\n#Start FORWARD section\necho -ne \"Applying FORWARD rules...\"\n\n#rule 1\n/sbin/iptables -A FOWRARD... || ok=0\n\n#rule 2 \n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD... || ok=0\n\necho -ne \"\\t\\t\\t\"\nif [ $ok -eq 1 ]; then\n  echo \"[OK]\"\nelse\n  echo \"[fail]\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox is not updating to Version 4.1. Why? I use VirtualBox (not the OSE version) which I installed (following the instructions at www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) using this repository:\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian natty contrib \nUp until Version 4.0.12 the software has updated automatically. Version 4.1 has just been released and, although I can see it in Synaptic, it doesn't seem to be recognized as an update to the previous version by Synaptic or by Update Manager.\nWhy is this, and is it safe to just install it alongside the previous version?\n\nA: Oracle treat point releases (4.x) as new releases, not upgrades (4.x.y).\nAs such - for stability reasons, some people continue with, for example, 4.0.x until either support for 4.0 is withdrawn, or sufficient bugs are flattened in the new 4.1.x releases.\nThe usual policy is to deinstall your 4.0 release before downloading and installing the 4.1 release.\nAll your previous settings and virtual machines are safe since they are stored separately from the actual package.\nSince it is a new release, you'll need to also upgrade the Virtual Guest Additions for each Virtual Machine that you have.\n\nA: From one of the pages fossfreedom linked to:\n\nQ: What is the proper way to upgrade?\nA: Since version 1.6.0, you no longer need to uninstall VB in\n  Windows, but can install it on top of the current installation. This\n  can be done by running the installer and follow the on screen\n  instructions. For Linux Hosts, just run the install file (.dep, .rpm\n  or what package manager you use) as root. The package will be updated\n  automatically. For other systems, it should be the same procedure. The\n  one exception to this is due to naming clashes: you do need to\n  properly remove an OSE package if you are replacing an OSE version\n  with a PUEL versions (for example because you need USB support). All\n  VMs are kept during the upgrade or when you uninstall VB.\nMoving to a new major version can be problematic too for Linux\n  users. If you want to upgrade, fully remove the old version and then\n  install the new one. It is advised to purge residual config, but it\n  is not mandatory. For Debian based systems, this can be done using the\n  following command (or use Shift+Del in the package manager for\n  complete removal):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge virtualbox-2.0\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-2.1\n\nSame goes for the upgrade to newer major releases, like 3.0.\n\n\nA: You need to remove Virtualbox \ncommand: sudo apt-get remove virtualbox\nThen install Virtualbox from Virtualbox.org > downloads.\nSave and open file with Ubuntu Software Center > click install.\n", "Q: How do I insert special characters in Open Office?

So I want Ubuntu One to work in Turkish Ubuntu. What should I do?\n\nA: You are most likely experiencing bug #467397. A possible workaround is described here:  \n\nAs far as I was able to test this bug, the locale change is required\n  for ubuntuone-client-applet (OAuth module), not syncdaemon. Syncdaemon\n  is able to sync files with tr_TR locale.\nOpen gnome-session-properties, select \"Ubuntu One\" entry, Edit it and\n  prefix the available command with env LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8, so that\n  Command (Komut) is env LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 ubuntuone-client-applet\nThe client will be started with English/USA locale on next login.\n  This is still a workaround but at least it will not require manual\n  syncdaemon/applet startup with en_US locale. \n\n", "Q: Is there a way to set Unity 3d's dock/launcher to be completely opaque like Unity 2d's? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I change the Unity Launcher transparency? \n\nUnity 3d icons and launcher:  \n\nUnity 2d icons and launcher:\n\nIn unity 2d, the icons looks darker than in 3d.

As you Ubuntu folks know, Canonical has switched away from the gnome desktop in favor of Unity for Natty. However, you can still access Gnome through a \"classic\" option in the login screen. Since I can't live without bluetile (a tiling window manager) I've been sticking with the \"classic\" option but then launching bluetile every time I turn on my PC. (Before Natty, there was a \"gnome + bluetile\" option available on login that made this unnecessary.)\nMy question is, what's the Right Way to configure my box to once again have a working \"gnome + bluetile\" option available on login? There is no documentation for this and it involves some pretty arcane linux/xwindows stuff I don't fully understand.\nIs the correct answer to create a new file with the name\n/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/bluetile.session? This is the best I've been able to guess. How do I found out the correct info for this file? Is there an example of this anywhere on the interwebs? I can't find any.\nThanks for any tips!\n\nA: Have a look into the documentation under http://www.bluetile.org:\n\nOne way to set up Bluetile as your default window manager under GNOME\n  is to make sure that the environment variable WINDOW_MANAGER contains\n  the path to the Bluetile binary before GNOME starts. This can be\n  achieved by putting something like the following line into ~/.gnomerc:\nexport WINDOW_MANAGER=/home/user/.cabal/bin/bluetile\n\nSo, basically change metacity with bluetile and you're done.\n", "Q: Does nginx use \"deferred\" as the default for the listen directive? Many sites recommend using 'deferred' with the listen directive for nginx. Is this necessary on the Ubuntu installation or is \"listen 80\" sufficient with 'deferred' on by default?\nlisten 80 default deferred; # for Linux\n\n\nA: deferred is not enabled by default on Ubuntu, there is no patch that enables it by default.\nBelow is my attempt to get an understanding of what the option does.\nFrom the reference at http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#listen:\n\ndeferred -- indicates to use that postponed accept(2) on Linux with the aid of option TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT\n\nRight, it refers to the manual page accept, section 2 - System calls (functions provided by the kernel). Unfortunately I couldn't find any information in that manual page about the effect of it, so I started digging in the source code (apt-get source nginx).\nThe option is enabled in nginx-0.8.54/src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c:3534. If deffered accept is not supported, you should get an error message on startup:\n\nthe deferred accept is not supported on this platform, ignored\n\nAt this point I stopped searching further.

I wanted to install a package to monitor the temperature of my CPU called lm-sensors.\nAccording to Synaptic, it's already installed.  \nCan someone give me some simple step-by-step instructions on how I can actually run it from the command line or otherwise?\n\nA: lm-sensors \nis a set of tools to control and view sensors that may be present on your hardware. Included are several applications that run from the command line:\n\n*\n\n*sensors: shows the current readings of all sensor chips.\n\n*sensord: daemon to periodically log sensor readings to syslog\n\n*fancontrol: calculates fan speeds from temperatures and sets the corresponding PWM outputs\n\n*pwmconfig: tests the PWM outputs of sensors and configures fancontrol\n\n*and more (see lm-sensors documentation for details)\n\nTo run these programs open a terminal and type the name of the application (including optional parameters, see manpages for details). This will give an output similar as shown here for sensors:\n~$ sensors\n\nk8temp-pci-00c3\nAdapter: PCI adapter\nCore0 Temp:  +30.0°C                                    \nCore0 Temp:  +30.0°C                                    \nCore1 Temp:  +29.0°C                                    \nCore1 Temp:  +36.0°C                                    \n\nit8718-isa-0228\nAdapter: ISA adapter\n[...] # shortened\n\nConfiguration of lm-sensors is done by configuration files in /etc/sensors3.conf and in /etc/sensors.conf (for details see manpage for sensors.conf).\n\nA: psensor\nsudo apt install psensor\n\nI'm quite fond of psensor... it runs on the Indicator Bar (the \"Systray\" near the clock), so it is perhaps the most unobtrusive app that uses lm-sensors. It also can show a nice window with graphs displaying the history of each sensor, just like System Monitor does for memory, CPU usage, etc. It has logging too!\nIt also uses sensors other than lm-sensors, like hddtemp for HDD temperatures and NVidia and AMD GPU (video cards) temperature and fan.\n\nBetter screenshots than mine can be found in the author's website:\nhttp://wpitchoune.net/psensor/\n\nA: xsensors \nsudo apt install xsensors\n\nIt has a graphical interface that is easy to understand. It shows me the motherboard voltages (there are four of them), the CPU and motherboard temperature as well as the CPU fan speed, the speed of three chassis fans and the power fan speed. All monitored in real time. And it loads into the the Unity Dash.\n\n\nA: Once lm-sensors is installed you need to reach for your terminal:\ntype\nsudo sensors-detect\n\njust press ENTER for everything it suggests (shown in Uppercase)\nAt the end it will ask you whether to add what it finds to /etc/modules.  If you are happy with the findings type \"yes\".\nMore information about lm-sensors and how to tailor it for your system can be found on the lm-sensors installation wiki page\nTyping \nsensors\n\nwill display the values for the sensors detected previously. \ne.g.\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:       +55.0°C  (crit = +90.0°C)\n\n\nA: For the record, if anyone is interested to get e-mail notifications/alerts on fans dying or temperatures shooting through the roof, I've written a simple service in Perl to do that monitoring for me. I've uploaded the source code and README to Github. I.e. yet another e-mail notification daemon :-)\nCouldn't find anything similarly trivial in the interwebs, now that sensord is deprecated... = just my two cents worth.\n\nA: If you use XFCE, I think it`s better to show it in toolbar, like this,  use this plugin:\n\nThe effect is this:\n\n2:\n", "Q: How do I install Secondlife? How the heck do I install the latest version of Secondlife for natty?

If someone could tell me commands to run that would help I have secondlife for linux version SecondLife-i686-2.7.4.235167 I have it downloaded now what do I do?\n\nA: 1) You need to unpack the packet you downloaded. You can do it with archive manager. You can also do it from command line - since the linux packet available for download from Second Life looks like a tar-bzip2 archive, the command to unpack it is:\ntar -xjvf SecondLife-i686-2.7.4.235167.tar.bz2\nThat will create a directory where all the files are unpacked.\n2) You may perform an installation by running the install.sh within the unpacked directory. But it seems that just running the application will do this automatically, so this isn't required.\n3) You can run the application directly by running the binary file secondlife in the unpacked directory. To do this from command line, enter the directory and just run ./secondlife.\nAlso note that in the README-linux.txt file of the package it says\n\nFor in-world MOVIE and MUSIC PLAYBACK, you will need (32-bit) GStreamer 0.10\n  installed on your system.

I'm trying out Gnome Shell in 11.04. You can push the \"activities\" key to get into the overview where you can launch applications. I like the idea of the overview as an aid in switching focus, but it's too slow for just launching an application. Is Gnome Shell going to implement, or does it have, a way to launch applications (besides the alt-f2 command launcher) that is as quick as Gnome-do?\nedit: To be clear, I'm aware of several Gnome application launchers. I'm curious about the Gnome Shell and any packages it includes (not add-ons like Gnome-do or Synapse).\n\nA: The closest I can think of is that you can pin applications to the dock on the left side in the Windows section of the Overview. AFAIK, GNOME Shell doesn't have a built-in GNOME-Do equivalent...in fact, I think its inclusion was once suggested to the developers and they turned it down in favor of using the Overview.\n\nA: For using the activities overview quicky, there are a couple tricks you might like. First, to open an application without closing the overview, drag and drop it to a workspace instead of clicking it directly. Also, the shell has been designed to make searching really efficient, so as soon as you click the Activities button or hit the Super key, you can start typing! I can open gedit almost instantly, for example, by pressing Super, then \"ge\" and Enter.\nYou might like the dock extension for Gnome Shell. To install it, the people at WebUpd8 have a repository with a bunch of Gnome Shell extensions, including the dock.\nTo add their repository, open a terminal and type the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd then, to install the extension, type:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-dock\n\nTo enable the extension, first you need to restart Gnome Shell. To do that really quickly, press Alt+F2, type r and press Enter. Now open Gnome Tweak Tool (you may need to install that from Software Centre), head to the Shell Extensions section and turn on the Dock Extension! It will appear on the right side of the screen.\nYou can configure some basic settings for the dock in dconf. Open dconf-editor (again, you might need to install it) and, on the left, go to /org/gnome/shell/extensions/dock. From there you can choose the side of the screen the dock lives on, its size, and whether it autohides.\n\nA: Try Synapse.\nIt requires zeitgeist, and offers some very useful features, such as quick keyboard shortcuts, plugins, themes, etc.\nIn response to your edit: no, they will not implement it, so you need to use something else.\n", "Q: Application which will display the current coordinates of the mouse cursor?

I deleted a folder today while I was thinking I had clicked on another one. \nIs there any log that I can search to find the name of the folder I just deleted?\nThe files deleted were probably not important (it was a subfolder of a folder I keep movies) so I don't need to recover them - I just need the name of the folder.\nIn case it matters, the folder used to be on a ntfs-formatted partition that has a bug on my system (or is it in every ntfs out there? I never searched cause I liked it better the way it is now) to not send files to trash.\n\nA: No, besides sending files to Trash before actually deleting there is no registration of what was deleted. \n\nA: No, I don't think there are any logs kept about deleted files. (Unless they're just deleted by moving them to the trash folder, in which case they are not yet removed from the system.)\nHowever, there are tools that may allow you to browse and even recover the deleted files, along with their file names. In case you've done nothing else with the partition after the files were deleted, these should do a good job. \nProbably the most popular one is TestDisk.

Thank you.\n\nA: If the package is installed through the package management system, you can show its files with the command \ndpkg -L package-name\n\n\nA: In addition to enzotibs answer, some packages separate their shared/static data from the main package. Examples includes hedgewars (static data in hedgewars-data) and apache2 (binaries in apache2.2-bin and images+manuals in apache2.2-common, this is shared among the MPMs prefork, worker event and itk).\nTo get the immediate package dependency, use:\napt-cache depends package-name\n\nAlternatively, use http://packages.ubuntu.com/ which shows a small description for each package too. For example, the apache2 package points to apache2.2-common. The filelist is available through the link in the Files column at the Download table.\ndpkg -L package-name show files which are installed by the package management system. Sometimes an installed file is not available in that list because the package installation script bypasses the package manager. There is nothing you can do against that other than guessing from the file name.\nShould you wonder which package a file belongs to, run:\ndpkg -S /path/to/file\n\nThis will list each package associated with the file. If you just provide a file name, you could get a long list with all files matching the search criteria.\n\nA: What do you mean by data? Do you mean the configuration files that the program uses to set the preferences that you chose in the program? If so, then they are kept in your home folder. They are so called hidden files. Use the file manager View menu to set Show hidden files and you will then see in the home folder a lot more folders. Each will have a dot ( . ) in front of it as part of the folder name.

I want to set up full disk encryption with pre-authentication boot. From reading I see there is a Guided Setup with Encryption option on the alternate CD installer. If I select this and follow the prompts, will I be all set? Are there any specific partitions or anything I need to create? Are there any special things I need to do before, during, or after installation because I'm installing on an SSD and not on an HDD?\nThe Thinkpad came preinstalled with Windows 7. I will be installing Natty Narwhal on the whole disk. I will not be dual-booting.\n\nA: There's no special considerations at all for SSD versus spinning HDD.\nAnd if you're comfortable using the Ubuntu Alternate Installer, it's fairly straightforward to setup full disk encryption.\n\nA: There are some performance considerations when using full disk encryption on an SSD. Here's an excerpt that explains the underlying issue nicely:\n\nYou write in pages (4KB) but you can only erase in blocks (128 pages\n  or 512KB); thus SSDs don't erase data when you delete it, only when\n  they run out of space to write internally. When that time comes, you\n  run into a nasty situation called the read-modify-write. Here, even to\n  just write 4KB, the controller must read an entire block (512KB),\n  update the single page, and write the entire block back out. Instead\n  of writing 4KB, the controller has to actually write 512KB - a much\n  slower operation.\n\nAs discussed at great length in this masterpiece on SSD performance, SSD performance drops over time as the disk fills up. As explained above. Typically, when setting up full disk encryption, the entire disk is filled with random data so as to obscure the encrypted data from the free space. This, as I understand it (and I'm certainly no expert) means that using full disk encryption one immediately goes to the worst case performance of the drive.\nSo, understand that the performance hit of encryption on an SSD will be far more potent than on a regular spinning drive.\nSecond, because of the way data is read / written, again as above, the standard methods for securely deleting files (like the shred utility) don't apply to SSDs. If you're using full disk encryption from the beginning, no problem. But if you already have unencrypted data on the drive, you need to be careful to ensure you fully zero the drive first. I'm not sure how that is done, but I think it's discussed in the masterpiece.\nFundamentally, SSDs function in a totally different way to traditional spinning disks. The bulk of encryption software, secure deletion tools, and guidelines, assume that disks are made of spinning platters. That doesn't apply to the world of SSDs.\nMy advice to somebody starting out with full disk encryption on an SSD would be two-fold.\nFirst, either start with a clean drive, or carefully zero it before you begin.\nSecond, under partition the drive. So partition 80%, or as little of the drive as you can get away with. The additional free space can help to maintain drive performance. It does depend on the specific drive, so you could research the details for the exact drive you have and so on, but as a general principle, it can dramatically extend the life of the drive.\nThirdly, and I realise I said two-fold, understand that full disk encryption will simply massacre SSD performance. Personally, that's a trade off I'm willing to make for the security that full disk encryption affords me, but there are alternatives, such as an encrypted home directory in Ubuntu. That type of encryption will likely perform much better on an SSD, although it does have other issues worth considering.\n", "Q: Gnome session uses KDE default cursor I installed KDE over my Ubuntu 10.04 installation.

I have a 64bit Ubuntu 10.04 server with 24GB of RAM and is used as a VMWare Workstation 7.1 host. I would like to use an in-memory drive for the VM Memory location, which I setup as the following:\ntmpfs /mnt/vmware tmpfs defaults,size=100% 0 0\n\nThat all works. Next I want to allocate 16GB of RAM to the VM, I know its a lot but we do a lot of processing that needs a lot of RAM.\nAfter the VM is started and I run df -h, I get the following for that drive:\nFilesystem             Size  Used  Avail Use% Mounted On\ntmpfs                  24G   11G   14G  44% /mnt/vmware\n\nWhy is it that the Available (14GB) size does not equal the Size (24GB) of the drive? And why wouldn't the whole 16GB get allocated to the memory space, which is what i set in the vmware guest .vmx file? Is there a limit to the space that can be allocated to a tmpfs file system?\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: Available space does not have to equal size. What you're seeing in the case of /dev/shm is the fact that the system uses very little or zero space for this filesystem (Used = 0), so in this case available = size.\nI'm not sure why df doesn't show 16G of used space, but, generally speaking, when a process asks the kernel for allocation of space, the request might be granted, but the kernel can in fact allocate smaller space and later (in case more memory is needed) expand it.\n\nA: If the VM image is allocated as a sparse file, then it is possible for the apparent size to be larger than the file system in question.\nIn effect, if regions of a file have not been written to then there is no need to allocate any pages to store the parts that are just full of zeroes.  So presumably 5GB of the guest image file you created is empty.  If that space is used by the VM, the additional pages will be allocated to store it (assuming the resources are available at that time).\n", "Q: What programs can display an RTFD (rich text + attachments) document? Nothing on my Ubuntu 11 system seems to automatically open rtfd files.\n\nA: As far as I know, it is a mac file and it can't be opened in Linux. \nSee also in Wikipedia.\n\nIn contrast to RTF, RTFD files cannot be opened properly by applications on non-Mac OS X operating systems, as bundles are currently only supported on Mac OS X.\n\n\nA: While there might not be any GNU/Linux applications that support .rtfd files, the d in .rtfd stands for directory. That is, this is actually a folder, and you can look inside it to see the constituent files which provide the document's content. This will often make it possible to access the document.\nSee this Wikipedia article for more information about the RTFD format.\nAlso, that article suggests that Ink.app, and possibly other GNUstep programs, can open RTFD files; it should be possible to install that in Ubuntu, though I don't think there's any official Ubuntu package that provides it.\n", "Q: Black screen on login and then flickering of GUI elements on Nvidia 9500GS Last week i tried to install Ubuntu 11.04 and i have a problem i cannot solve.\nMit Grafics Card is an Nvidia 9500GS which worked well with Ubuntu, Compiz and stuff before.\nThe Problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*i installed Ubuntu 11.04 from the life cd besides an Windows 7 Home Premium\n\n*When i boot up ubuntu everything seems to be right\n\n*The logon screen appears\n\n*When i log in the screen is black in an interval of less then a second i can see the gui elements (panels, desktop icons etc.. flickering).\n\n*The only way i can shutdown the system now is doing it the hardware-way\n\n\nWhat i tryied so far (1.

Some information here.\nI don't understand why pico2wave is, compared to espeak or mbrola, rarely discussed. It's small, but sounds really good (natural). Without modification you'll hear a natural sounding female voice.\nAND ... compared to Mbrola, it recognise Units and speaks it the right way!\nFor example:\n\n*\n\n*2°C →   two degrees\n\n*2m →    two meters\n\n*2kg →    two kilograms\n\nAfter installation I use it in a script:\n#!/bin/bash\npico2wave -w=/tmp/test.wav \"$1\"\naplay /tmp/test.wav\nrm /tmp/test.wav\n\nThen run it with the desired text:\n<scriptname>.sh \"hello world\"\n\nor read the contents of an entire file:\n<scriptname>.sh \"$(cat <filename>)\"\n\nThat's all to have a lightweight, stable working TTS on Ubuntu.\n\nA: I find Nitech HTS voices on festival very natural and comforting over any other voices I have heard. See this link on how to set up Nitech and other sounds with festival. I have not found a good gui which I can use to configure those voices but setting them via festival.scm still works. That post is very old and you might want to find the actual installation directory using \n\"locate festival\" command\n\nA: Combine SVOX tools (pico) with LibreOffice:\nSVOX (pico) tools are easy to install and brings good quality voices in Ubuntu. Install it:\nsudo apt-get install libttspico0 libttspico-utils libttspico-data\n\nYou can use LibreOffice in combination with SVOX (pico) tools by install the \"Read Text\" extension and you obtain a \"GUI\" for this excellent TTS software:\nSet up Read Text Extension's options with Tools - Add-ons - Read selection.... Use /usr/bin/python as the external program. Select a command line option that includes the token (PICO_READ_TEXT_PY), you may want to experiment some of them. \nNow you only have to select some text in LO Writer, Calc, Impress or Draw and clic on the icon added as a tool bar (a happy face with a ballon).\n\nA: Here is what I did to have pure natural speech for pdf and other text files(other solutions are not natural or they're just paid services). This is actually a work around using chromium or chrome but works fast and easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install SpeakIt! extension on your chrome or chromium.\n\n*Install PDF Viewer if you're using chromium(chrome already has a pdf viewer for free) and check 'Allow in incognito' and 'Allow access to file URLs' options in extensions settings of chromium.\n\n*Drag and drop your pdf to browser.\n\n*Now highlight some text and right click and select SpeakIt! so you can listen to pure natural text-to-speech.\n\n\nThere's also ways to open other files like .doc and .txt in chrome and do the same. There's other extensions for chrome that view pdf files, check if it fits you better. Besides you can upload all kind of texts in Google Drive and use SpeakIt! to read it for you.\nAnother extension called 'Speak text' works the same way and has natural speech.\n\nA: Pico and espeak are fun and easy to get to work, but they're not all that good.\nThe default Festival voices are also not that good. However, Festival is a scheme-based speech framework, where a number of researchers have built much better plug-in voices. You can easily surpass the pico2wave quality on stock Ubuntu, because one of those voices is available as a ready-made package.\nTo make Festival sound natural, here's what to do:\nsudo apt-get install festival\nsudo apt-get install festvox-us-slt-hts\nfestival -i\nfestival> (voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts) \nfestival> (SayText \"Don't hate me, I'm just doing my job!\")\n\nYou can do it from the command line by using -b (or --batch) and putting each command into single quotes:\nfestival -b '(voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts)' \\\n    '(SayText \"The temperature is 22 degrees centigrade and there is a slight breeze from the west.\")'\n\nYou can get other quite good voices from the Nitech repository, but installing them is finicky, and the default paths changed so the file name references in the bundled scheme files may need to be manually edited to work on stock Ubuntu.\n\nA: SpeakIt!\nI believe Ive found the best TTS software for free using a Google Chrome extension called \"SpeakIt\". This only works in the Chrome browser for me on Ubuntu. It doesnt work with Chromium for some reason. SpeakIt comes with two female voices which both sound very realistic compared to everything else out there. There are at least four more male & female voices listed s Chrome extensions if you search the Chrome Web Store using \"TTS\" as your query.\nUsage: For use on a website. you highlight the text you want to be read and either right click and \"SpeakIt\" or click the SpeakIt icon docked on the Chrome top bar.\n\nFirefox users also have two options. Within Firefox addons, do a search for TTS and you should find \"Click Speak\" and also \"Text to Voice\". The voices are not as good as the Chrome SpeakIt voices, but are definitely usable.\nThe SpeakIt extension uses iSpeech technology and for a price of $20 a year, the site can convert text to MP3 audio files. You can input text, URLs, RSS feeds, as well as documents such as TXT, DOC, and PDF and output to MP3. You can make podcast, embed audio, etc. Here is a link, and a sample of their audio (don't know how long the link will last).\n\nA: When searching for a better tts engine to use with the new firefox 49 narrative mode I found pico tts (svox) - my favorite TTS engine.\nsudo apt install espeak libttspico0 libttspico-data libttspico-utils\n\nHow to change the default speech synthesis engine system wide? \nPeople at arch linux brought me to the right path:\nUncomment the module you like and make it default in speech-dispatcher settings:\n# sudo vim /etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf\n\n[...]\n# -----OUTPUT MODULES CONFIGURATION-----\n# Each AddModule line loads an output module.\n#AddModule \"espeak\"       \"sd_espeak\"   \"espeak.conf\"\nAddModule \"pico-generic\"  \"sd_generic\"   \"pico-generic.conf\"\n\n[...]\n#DefaultModule espeak\nDefaultModule pico-generic\n\nRestart the daemon:\n# sudo systemctl restart speech-dispatcher.service\n\nBUT, when starting firefox again, nothing happens. According to the link above (arch forum post #10 and #16) works with festival (did not try), but the speech-dispatcher for pico does not list available voices. It won't run.\nAny idea out there would be highly appreciated ;-)\n\nA: Simple Google™ TTS\nUpdate from project page (2016): This project is currently unmaintained and will remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nBecause of the lack of a better alternative I wrote a bash script that interfaces with a perl script by Michal Fapso to provide TTS via Google Translate. From the project description:\n\nThe intention is to provide an easy to use interface to text-to-speech output via Google's speech synthesis system. A fallback option using pico2wave automatically provides TTS synthesis in case no Internet connection is found.\nAs it stands, the wrapper supports reading from standard input, plain text files and the X selection (highlighted text).\n\nThe main features are:\n\n*\n\n*online TTS synthesis via Google translate\n\n*offline TTS synthesis via pico2wave\n\n*supports a variety of different languages\n\n*can read from CLI, text files and highlighted text\n\n*supports reading highlighted text with fixed formatting (e.g. PDF files)\n\nInstallation and usage are documented on the project page.\nI'd be glad if you gave it a try. Bug reports and any other feedback are welcome!\n\nA: I have looked high and low for text to speech for Ubuntu that is high quality.  There is none.  My vocal cords are paralyzed so I needed TTS to add voice instructions to my Ubuntu videos.  You can get commercial high quality Linux text to speech software here. It's just really expensive. I ended up buying Natural Reader for Windows (doesn't work in Ubuntu under Wine) for $40.  Maybe later I will get the Linux one.\n\nA: My favorite text-to-speech program is called Magic English, but like Natural Reader mentioned by Joe Steiger, it is a Windows program and I'm not sure if it will run under Wine.\nAT&T Natural Voices is available online as a demo, but that's more of a work-around than a solution...\n\nA: For that I build Intelligent Speaker - extension for Google Chrome.

I have a Western Digital 2TB External Hard Drive. I basically use it to keep all my movies and videos. Its file system is NTFS, and currently I'm using 1.4TB. One night I turn it on and copied a 4GB file and there was no problem. Then I tried to copy another 6GB file and Ubuntu throw the following error: \"Input/output error\". I tried to create a new folder with no luck. I still could read the disk an play a file, so I thought restarting the computer would solve the problem, but it didn't. The next time, Ubuntu didn't mount the disk. \nAfter that I tried in another PC with Window 7. It throwed a message telling me: first, that the disk needs to be formatted, and second, a \"Local Disk #: Is not accessible. Data error (cyclic redundancy check)\". Here is when I started to worry. I tried to fix the disk with CHKDSK (chkdsk \\r). After about 5 hours, it crashed with the following error: \"An unspecified error occurred\".\nMy guess to all this is that the disk is dying. :'(\nLastly I did one more thing.

I don't know if there is a solution on Windows, and I'm worried about the time that it could take to do it with the slowness of Windows. Basically my question is: How can I recover the data? (Or at least some of it). Is there any program on Ubuntu that can help me with this (If I'm still on time)?. My main concern is the size of the disk (2TB), so I think I would need at least another 2TB disk to copy to.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: ddrescue \nTo recover data from a failing hard disk any further read or write access to this drive needs to be avoided as this dramatically increases damage and may eventually lead to a complete failure to access this drive.\nIt is therefore recommended that you first read all data that are still accessible on your drive by creating an image of this drive. Recovering your data can then be done from this image.\nDdrescue is a tool that allows copying all data from your drive and save it to either another (healthy) drive, or to an image on a healthy drive. The drive you save your image to needs to be at least of the same size as the original drive was.\nThere is a detailed guide on how to do this on the Forensic Wiki. The first step will be to boot your system e.g. from a live rescue system or CD and run the following command in a terminal:\nddrescue --no-split </dev/hda1> <imagefile> <logfile>\n\nReplace above <entries> according to your system setup.\nYou can then perform data recovery e.g by using testdisc or photorec on the generated imagefile.\n\nA: There are several Answers similar to your on how to recover data such as this one here.\nThe key-part is dont panic - and dont plug in your external drive until you've got another one to transfer data with.\nOnce SmartDisk starts giving you red errors - you can read this as serious hard-disk corruption or imminent disk failure.\nWhen you have another drive correctly formatted, use one of the recovery methods such as TestDisk or PhotoRec to try and recover data and transfer it onto your new external hard-drive.\n", "Q: voice is echoing on headphone I am using ubuntu 11.04 and whenever I am using headphone for music but the voice is echoing.

What do I need to do in Ubuntu to allow it to receive these logs?\n\nA: Another option is use syslog-ng, easy to use, and so far ready to go!\nsudo apt-get install syslog-ng\n\nAfter install it, we have a conf file in /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf\nSo, just edit this .conf with our parameters, but before that, make a backup of default config file, can be usefull later if you want tunning some parameters\nsudo mv /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.bak\n\nNow create new config file and edit it!\nsudo touch /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf\nsudo nano /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf\n\nSo, just paste this basic config to get working as well:\n# Listening to incoming UDP Syslog connections\nsource mysource { udp(); };\n\n#Add the syslog targets:\n\ndestination dest { file(\"/var/log/Cisco$YEAR$MONTH$R_DAY.log\"); };\n#destination dest_other_server { udp(\"1.2.3.4\" port(514)); };\n#Create the filters that will be used to determine what to do with the received syslog message\n\n#filter filter { ( host(\"2.3.4.5\") and level(notice) and match(\"username=.*@domain\\.local\" value(\"MESSAGE\") flags(\"utf8\" \"ignore-case\")) ); };\nfilter myfilter { ( level(notice) ); };\n#And putting it all together:\n\nlog { source(mysource); filter(myfilter); destination(dest);  };\n\nEasy as you can see. Take care!\n\nA: The host receiving the logs will need to be running some syslog daemon that is configured to listen for remote logs.  There are a number of syslog implementations in Ubuntu, but rsyslog is typically recommended, and should be installed by default.  I can't tell from the documentation in the link you posted if DD-WRT is sending logs via TCP or UDP, so it may require some experimentation to find precisely the correct settings, if you are concerned about reducing the number of network-accessible ports on your host.\nThere are two ways to enable this: the first is simpler, but may require re-integration when the system is upgraded.  The second is slightly more complicated, and may cause confusing results if there are significant changes to the syslog configuration as part of an update.  I would choose the second, but your preference may vary.\nThe first is to edit /etc/rsyslogd.conf, and remove the initial # from the following lines:\n\n#$ModLoad imudp\n#$UDPServerRun 514\n\nor\n\n#$ModLoad imtcp\n#$InputTCPServerRun 514\n\nThe second is to create a new file, perhaps named local-enable-tcp.conf in /etc/rsyslog.d/, with the following contents:\n\n# enable TCP syslog reception\n$ModLoad imtcp\n$InputTCPServerRun 514\n\nIf you want to use the separate file approach, and need UDP, change the contents to match the UDP stanza above.  The specific filename is not important, but it is recommended to start it with \"local-\" as this namespace is reserved for local administrator configuration, and it must end with \".conf\", as only files ending like this are automatically included in the rsyslog configuration.\nIf you would prefer to use another syslog implementation, check the configuration and documentation for that implementation: it is likely that the syslog daemon is configured not to listen on the network by default, but example configuration to enable this common case ought be clearly documented.\n\nA: Basically, you run a daemon (called a syslogd) on your server for the dd-wrt router to posts logs to.\nTutorial-\nhttp://www.techiecorner.com/1479/how-to-setup-syslog-server-in-ubuntu/\n", "Q: What happens if Déjà Dup tries to back up to a disconnected external disc? I have just installed Déjà Dup on my (11.04) laptop and have scheduled automatic weekly backups to an external hard disc which is not always connected to the laptop. \nWhat will happen if a scheduled backup is attempted when the external disc is not connected?\n\nA: From v14 release note:\n\nThe most visible new feature is much better support for external drives. Now Deja Dup will notice if the drive is not connected when a scheduled backup occurs, and will wait for it to be connected. It will notify you that it is waiting. \n\n\nA: Deja Dup uses duplicity as backend which would just fail if the backend directory (your external disk) is not available. Since the backup logic is not in Deja Dup, but in duplicity, no backup would be attempted to be created.\nSo, no data loss, no local backup cache pollution. If the backend is not available, there won't even be an attempt to check data to be backed up.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One wont connect with an authentication failure I have set up account.

I have set up aliases for apt-get update, apt-get install, and so on. \nThats quite convenient. But what I really would like to have is something like this: \ntype agi TAB vi and have it automatically list all packages starting with vi, as it would happen when issuing apt-get install TAB vi.  \nWould something like this be achievable somehow, maybe by writing a little script?\n\nA: Bash programmable completion is something I haven't bothered much with myself, but I believe this will do what you want (NB assumes bash version 4.0 or newer. If you run Ubuntu 10.04 or newer, you're good.):\nalias agi='apt-get install'\n_agi_completion() { \n    mapfile -t COMPREPLY < <(apt-cache --no-generate pkgnames \"${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}\")\n}\ncomplete -F _agi_completion agi\n\nProgrammable Completion in bash's manual explains how it works, though it's quite complex.\n\nA: You need to add your aliases to the shell completion dictionaries so it knows what it is completing for those commands. The shell completions should already be named functions, but you have to tell it that they apply to your new command names.\n", "Q: how to make programs that autostart at login start hidden? How do I start applications that autostart on login start hidden in the system tray?  Is there special command (i.e. --hidden) to the autostart command to make the application start to the system tray?\nI know in Kubuntu 11.04 Kwin allows \"Special Windows Settings\" to set a specific rule to start an application minimized but haven't seen any rule to start to tray.\nI'm looking to start Mobloquer to the system tray on login, but a more general method to solve this problem that applies to all programs would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: kstart --iconify <program name> in KDE starts  minimized. I really don't know if there is a specific command to close to systray (even because many apps don't have a systray). \nAnother possibility is using ksystray. For example ksystraycmd --hidden kmail will start kmail and put it in the system tray. But i'm not quite sure if it will work for any app.\nIf not, probably you have to check if there is a specific option for your application.\nYou can find more info here.\nEDIT : more info here too\n\nA: In Gnome\nJust for the record: In gnome currently the best way to start applications minimized is devilspie  / sudo apt-get install devilspie.\nDevil's pie rules go in ~/.devilspie and are called someName.ds so to start the terminal minimized you would to something like:\nconfus@confusion:~$ mkdir ~/.devilspie\nconfus@confusion:~$ cd ~/.devilspie\nconfus@confusion:~$ echo -e \"\n> (if\n>     (is (application_name) \"Terminal\")\n>     (begin\n>        (minimize)\n>     )\n> )\" >> terminal.ds\nconfus@confusion:~$ devilspie\n\nThe last command is used to start the Devil's Pie  daemon. But devils pie is much more powerful than this. You can find out more properties by which to identify windows unsing echo \"(debug)\" >> ~/.devilspie/debug.ds. Now when you start the daemon in terminal it will put out information for each window, when it's started.\nFor more see the Devil's Pie Documentation.\nGraphical configuration\n\nYou can also configure Devil's Pie using gdevilspie  / sudo apt-get install gdevilspie\n", "Q: What to install for mysql? I am going to learn mysql by myself, so I would like to install mysql on . But there are many applications related to mysql in synaptics. I was wondering what are some basic applications to be installed?\nConsider these two cases: mysql for webserver use, or mysql not for webserver use. Will the packages to be installed for the two cases be different?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: The packages for the usages of MySQL will not vary at all.  For a basic MySQL server (and client program so you can use the server), you will run the following:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client\nThat will install both the server and the client program, as well as any dependencies that those programs require.  The client program will allow you to interface with the database server.  You may install the server without mysql-client, if you are going to not use the mysql command via the server's terminal (such as with a remote mysql client, or using the mysql command in a terminal from another computer).\nNOTE: This stuff was originally in comments on @mbx's answer, but this is actually an answer, not a comment :P\n\nA: I'd recommend phpmyadmin running on apache. You can quite easily look at the content of your tables. SQL execution is also supported. For PosgreSQL there is pgadmin as standalone tool, MySQL Workbench seems to be a similar one.\nIf your server is public (even if not), you should change the default passwords.\nI commonly use apt-get for installing packages, so\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client\n\nshould do the job, depending on your specific flavour of distribution.\nFor a server only installation, you can even omit the mysql-client if you want to save some bytes. It is used to connect to your dbms from the command shell, so if you might need it once you can still do a lazy installation...\n\nA: Consider reading this if you want to setup a LAMP on Ubuntu. You can also go to W3Schools for more learning material on SQL and others.\n", "Q: Why does unplugging my laptop trigger a 'lid close' event? Ever since switching my Acer Aspire One D150 laptop over to 11.04 full-time, I've noticed that whenever I remove the AC adapter plug from the computer it goes into standby immediately. This happens regardless of how long it's been charging.  Some quick searching yielded this Launchpad report, but it's been closed for some time with no solution posted.  I've got a simple workaround by setting the 'lid close' event in the power manager to simply turn the screen off. Is there a known fix for this or should I open a new issue?\n\nA: There is a similar - if not more pertinent - launchpad bug for your laptop model.\nReading through the bug report, it appears that the BIOS on your laptop is a good candidate for further investigation.\nThe bug report mentions version 1.09a of the BIOS that fixes the issue.

Is there any advantage to using \"ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable\" over just using what's available in the repositories for 11.04? \n\nA: Packages can take a bit of time before reaching repositories, having the ppa enables you to get the newest version earlier.\nAnd that is it really.\n\nA: There is currently no advantage to this as Firefox releases are pushed out to the distribution as quickly as possible after a Firefox release:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the latest stable version of Firefox?\nIn fact, that PPA is being retired. \n", "Q: How can I enable core dump?

The core dump size limit is zero.\n\nIs there any other setting I should modify? Thanks.\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit, 2.6.38-generic.\n\nA: I am guessing that you are running the crashing process as root. If that is the case, change the domain from '*' to 'root'. The limit.conf lines that contain the wildcard (a.k.a. '*') does not affect the 'root' account.\n\nA: /etc/security/limits.conf sets the limits, not the defaults.

I want use CCleaner on Ubuntu 10.04. But I do not know whether it is necessary or not.\nIs it necessary? Are there any benefits from using it?\n\nA: Bleachbit is the equivalent. Watch your settings (especially with browser settings). Also run:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nThis command removes previously downloaded archives which can safely be removed. Those archives are only used for faster reinstallations of programs.\nYou can also save a tonne of space by removing old unused kernels. You can save further space by uninstalling LibreOffice / OpenOffice.org and installing Abiword if you only use writer, install gnumeric if you also require spreadsheets.\n\nA: CCleaner is a windows application, even if you run it with Wine, it won't make any sense to do so because it removes files based on their file paths which is totally different on Ubuntu. Other programs ran by CCleaner have similar issues and registry cleaning will only affect the wine settings of CCleaner.\nSo, in no way is CCleaner beneficial on Ubuntu.\n\nA: CCleaner is a Windows program so it has no effect on Ubuntu. If you want to clean up your system use BleachBit. It is in the Ubuntu Software Centre. This program also cleans your Firefox directories and cookies.\n\nA: Here a command to remove by typing (better to copy and paste from here) ALL old unused kernels by typing a single row:\nsudo apt-get purge $(dpkg --get-selections | awk '((/^linux-/) && (/[0-9]\\./) && (!/'\"`uname -r | sed \"s/-generic//g\"`\"'/)) {print $1}')\n\n", "Q: Separate X screen + TwinView on NVIDIA GT 440 I want to use 3 displays connected on one Nvidia GeForce GT 44O under Ubuntu 10.04.\nSo there is my configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 display 1680x1050_60\n\n*1 display 1280x1024_60\n\n*1 DLP 1920x1080_60 (video projector)\n\n\nI want to have the two display in TwinView mode (extended desktop) and have the projector on a separate X screen in order to launch XBMC at boot on it.\nWhen I try to configure displays as said previously in nvidia-settings, I cannot activate 3 displays at the same time nor use \"TwinView\" and \"Separate X screen\" at the same time.\nIs it possible to do what I want ? If yes could you give me the xorg configuration?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: It is possible, although I think you might be asking a little too much of your video card.\nXorg configurations are slightly personal things, in that it's difficult to write one at a distance for someone without having access to their machine or knowing a lot of key details.\nThe steps involved would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backing up your working xorg.conf for reference\n\n*Using the nvidia-settings tool to generate an xorg.conf for your twinview'd screens\n\n*Using nvidia-settings again to generate an xorg.conf for your projector\n\n*Combining both files (with a view to your wokring xorg.conf), giving each it's own server flag and making sure you don't have conflicting name spaces\n\n\nIf everything goes wrong you can always fall back to the defaults using:\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh\n\nIf you're struggling post where you're at and I (or someone else, I dare-say) will try and help you- but simply writing one from scratch without access to the machine in question is beyond my abilities!\n", "Q: Why does Unity 2D have \"real time\" window updating when resizing window and Unity 3D does not? Unity 3D just shows orange square when resizing window. And since I'm not native english speaker, here is a screenshot showing what I'm trying to explain:\n\n\nA: Are you meaning that Unity 3D does not reupdate the windows when you resize it, instead showing orange box as outline?\nThe answer is to save computer resource, since if you let otherwise it would be extremely slow, as windows need to be redrawed each time you resize it, and updating them in real time will make the program to redraw over and over again, resulting in extreme (not excessive) resource consumption.\n\nA: I can't really answer your question in terms of why there's a difference, but I can tell you how to change the Unity 3D settings to give you your \"real time\" redraws.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CompizConfig Settings Manager. \n\n*Locate and enter the 'Resize Window' plugin settings in the 'Window Management' section. \n\n*Click on the 'General' Tab. \n\n*Choose between the available 'Normal', 'Outline', Rectangle' and 'Stretch' options.\n\n\nThe 'Normal' setting is the one you want, giving you real time updates of the window during resize. On my machine though this is painfully slow.\nThe Rectangle and Outline are very similar and draw a box representing the resized window.\nPersonally I like the 'Stretch' option, which gives you a faked-update of the window contents by simply stretching them.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Resizing windows while redrawing the whole content used to be smooth in Ubuntu. It stopped with Ubuntu 11.04 and Unity 3D on my computer which may be almost 5 years old but still no slouch. I believe it coincides with introduction of v0.9 of Compiz. Since then the \"Normal\" option for the \"Resize Window\" CCSM plugin is unusable. It is still broken in 12.04. Tonight I installed Xubuntu 12.04 in a VM and was astonished to see that windows are redrawn smoothly when resized! And we're talking virtual machine here (with 3D accel enabled).\nClearly, there is a serious problem with Compiz in that regard. \nEdit:  After a search I found the bug on Launchpad. Apparently a fix has been commited for 0.9.8 but I don't know if it will appear in 12.04. The bug can be found here on launchpad.\n@ Linux Distance, with modern PCs saving computer resource is ridiculous, plenty of cycles to spare - and your answer is beside the point.

One machine on wire one wireless. I found a tickbox in my router besides \"seperate ips for lan and wlan\" and ticked it off. Now i can login to the wireles computer. Before that i got the error message \"No route to host\".\n\nA: The routes look fine. I'll assume that those IP addresses are private ones (LAN) and not public accessible.\nSince you're connected in different ways to the network (wifi / wired), it's very likely that your router has separated wired / wireless networks. Try connecting both of them on a wired (or wireless) connection. Another possibility is that a firewall on the Ubuntu machines is blocking connections.\nOtherwise, configure your router to use the same network (subnet) for wireless and wired connections. Also make sure that the router does not block client-to-client communication.\nYour router is possibly dropping all unsolicited packets, that's why your friend gets a \"connection timed out\" message on your public IP address. Configure NAT port forwarding so that the public IP address + port combination forwards to your LAN address.\nExample network:\nYOUR NETWORK (A)\n    Router A (public address: 198.51.100.1)\n    Desktop A - 10.0.0.2\n    Laptop  A - 10.0.0.3\n\nYOUR FRIENDS NETWORK (B)\n    Router B (public address: 203.0.113.1)\n    Machine B - 192.168.0.2\n\nOn Router A, setup NAT forwarding:\nTo make your desktop accessible:\n  forward the public port 22 to 10.0.0.2\nTo make your laptop accessible:\n  forward the public port 2222 to 10.0.0.3\n\nIf you've a firewall (ufw, iptables, ...) on the machines set, allow incoming traffic to port 22 (Desktop A) and port 2222 (Laptop A).\nThe desktop can now be accessed using SSH with:\nssh user@198.51.100.1 -p 22\n\nThe laptop can now be accessed using SSH with:\nssh user@198.51.100.1 -p 2222\n\nIf you want to access your friends machine, apply these instructions to his machine + router.\n\nA: Check the ssh check box while installing RHEL.

Any type of guidelines, links, code work with detailed instructios is welcome.\n(I have written above matter with onboard - typing utility).\n\nA: I hate answers like this, but unfortunately you've stumbled upon a known, and reported bug.\nYour built-in keyboard will not work on Ubuntu 11.04, but if you plug-in an external one it will.\nMy only consolation is to say keep an eye on this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/677633\nHopefully, now the bug is confirmed, people will start doing their best to fix it for 11.11.\nHere's to hoping!\n", "Q: Notebook is booting when battery is removed I installed Ubuntu on my notebook, when I was using Windows it booted fine, but after change OS, sometimes it only boots if I  remove battery, is there any solution I can fix it \nHere is output of dmesg, unfortunately I couldn't paste output here it's more that 30000 charachters\n\nA: Looking at your dmesg output file it appears that on boot the kernel does not recognise your battery and lists the following error message:\nACPI: Deprecated procfs I/F for AC is loaded, please retry with CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS_POWER cleared\n\nThere is a bug report here that describes the issue you are having.\nNot knowing what version of Ubuntu you are currently running or your hardware I would recommend installing a later version of Ubuntu where the kernel is a later version and checking to see if it resolves your issue, otherwise you can follow this LONG Ubuntu Forums thread to try and solve the issue yourself.\n\nA: This very well could be a Hardware issue. When your system doesn't boot what do you see on your screen does it hang? If so is it before or after the Ubuntu screen.Believe it or not answering these questions can tell us alot.If it hangs before the Ubuntu screen its Probably a hardware issue  Does your screen stay blank. In which case could be a faulty battery or motherboard . \nIf its after the Ubuntu screen it could be a number of things causing this. Which we will need as much information as you can give. As in where its locking up and what your screen is showing and has showed during boot. Then maybe we can pin point what exactly has went wrong.\n", "Q: How to delete all the settings for Deja Dup When I upgraded to 11.04 Deja Dup started behaving strangely, it would begin a new full backup everytime the computer was started because it was looking for a drive and folder which I had removed some months earlier. Deja Dup had behaved perfectly normal under 10.10, but the upgrade seems to have it using old settings.\nSo I was wondering how can I purge all the configuration files and folders so that next time I reinstall Deja Dup it starts using and remembering the settings I want? I can not find any folders in /home/username/.config or in the home folder, but on each install something is telling Deja Dup to look at old settings.\nAny help would be great!\n\nA: To reset your deja-dup config you can use the following command on a terminal\nFrom Ubuntu 10.10\ndconf reset -f \"/org/gnome/deja-dup/\"\n\nUntil Ubuntu 10.04\ngsettings reset-recursively org.gnome.DejaDup\n\n\nA: Déjà Dup is the front-end for the duplicity program, Duplicity stores its data in ~/.cache/duplicity. That folder can safely be removed, if you connect with an earlier backup, those files will be recreated from the backup.\nSettings for Déjà Dup are stored in dconf. (source: Where is the configuration for dejadup stored?).\nTo quote Michael Terry:\n\nHello! The configuration for Deja Dup is stored in dconf, which you can view with dconf-editor (which in Ubuntu is available in the dconf-tools package).\nHowever, to view or edit your saved passwords, you should use the Passwords & Encryption Keys preference utility that comes with GNOME. That stores saved passwords for remote sites as well as the encryption password that Deja Dup saves if you chose to encrypt your backup.\n\nAs for system-wide settings, the configuration can be purged by running:\nsudo apt-get purge deja-dup\n\n", "Q: How to remove subvol from partition? I installed Natty 64-bit with btrfs filesystem only to find that it takes almost two minutes to boot.  I tried a few different things, and finally today opened up /etc/fstab only to find the following:\nUUID=b22ac5c7-e294-4d62-8189-6a3707148927 /      btrfs  defaults,subvol=@     0  1\nUUID=b22ac5c7-e294-4d62-8189-6a3707148927 /home  btrfs  defaults,subvol=@home 0  2\nUUID=24b7732d-f2f4-43a2-85c1-05b889a56524 none   swap   sw                    0  0\n\nI only vaguely remember the installation process, but it seemed pretty simple at the time, and I don't remember creating any sub volumes.  I tried editing the first two entries to show a single entry (with lzo compression):\nUUID=b22ac5c7-e294-4d62-8189-6a3707148927 /      btrfs  defaults,compress=lzo 0  1\n\nand it wound me up with nothing in my home directory, but booted much faster than before, just over one minute.\nSo, my question is, how do I go about putting / and /home on a single volume in fstab, rather than two subvolumes?\n\nA: You repartition, format the new partition, and mount it as /home, but that would defeat one of the big reasons to use btrfs in the first place.  The ability to have different subvolumes without having to have a completely separate partition is one of the much anticipated features of btrfs.\n\nA: I've just googled about, and the slow boot time you're experiencing maybe down to the (largely useless) fsck utility for the btrfs.\nYou can try removing (make a backup first!) the /sbin/fsck.btrfs link, which will prevent it checking your drive, and may prevent the delays at boot.\n", "Q: Turning MeeGo into Ubuntu or Lubuntu Practical question:  I have MeeGo pre-installed and working fine on my Lenovo S10. With fresh-installed Lubuntu some devices are not working. I don't like MeeGo interface. If I uninstall it's graphical interface and install LXDE or Ubuntu-package will it work?\nThanks a lot for reading this\n\nA: There seems to be quite a lot of versions of the Lenovo S10 (I don't own one, so it's hard to comment,) however the Ubuntu Hardware List states that it is supported and works fine, and a search on the forums seem to support this.\nI noticed that you picked LUbuntu, I wonder if you could try the vanilla Ubuntu installation- you should be able to get an indication from the liveCD as to whether any of the bugs you mention persist.\nApparently MeeGo uses the rpm package management system, so it would be difficult to simply 'install' any ubuntu interface (which uses apt) on top of it. \n\nA: I have used Meego on my Lenovo S10-2. First things first. If you have meego now you will either have to dual boot it with another distro ubuntu lubuntu etc. \nAs I have suggested in your other question I would try to test which other one would better suit your pc. I have Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity working fine and dandy on my Lenovo S10-2 (yours might be slightly different to mine) but I have also had Kubuntu netbook edition running on it very well. I have also tested Lubuntu a while ago where it work ok too. \nThis issue here is not which one but what you want out of it for your netbook. \nYou cannot install Ubuntu components on top of your meego system but instead could either dual boot it or wipe your Meego off the pc at the Ubuntu install stage. \nIf you test any of the 'buntu flavours you may find that you have wifi issues but they are more easily resolved with them than in Meego and there is plenty of guidance here if you have Broadcom Drivers ( which I did). (Ubuntu installs these very well for you when you install it) \nMeego is based on different architecture I guess to explain it than Ubuntu. So instead of installing .rpm packages you use .deb packages. \nSo, download a few different flavours and see which one looks better and feels better on your pc. Then if you are ready to change from Meego, back up your data that you want to keep (emails, documents favourites etc) and choose your flavour!\nInstalling either Ubuntu and or Meego (which I take it you have done already) is quite easy and painless and fast ( abit too fast for people like me who then change from one distro to another!)\n", "Q: Who owns Ubuntu and the ownership of Ubuntu as a going concern \nPossible Duplicates:\nWho pays for Ubuntu?\nUbuntu finances and future of project?\nHow does Ubuntu make money?\n\nAs I read Mark Shuttlesworth (hope i got it correct) is the one calling the shots through his owned created trust (God bless him). My question is that what will happen if he (God forbid) suddenly withdraws his funds from the Ubuntu project?  \n\nA: As Ubuntu is an established brand, with many supporters and a good reputation most likely some sponsor will buy them out and continue. But this is not going to happen some time soon. Also such a speculative question is usually deleted closed here.\n", "Q: Running Xubuntu without panels I'm running Xubuntu with AWN and I would like to turn off all the XFCE panels, but it does not allow me to do so with the last one. Is there any way to do it?\n\nA: In /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml\nJust comment the xfce-panel section.\n\nA: Pending a better option, you could just nuke it after it loads. Crunchbang does something like this in ~/.config/xfce4/autostart.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ...other autostart things...\n\nif [ \"$(pidof xfce4-panel)\" ]; then\n    killall xfce4-panel &\nfi\n\navant-window-navigator &\n\nYes, it's a hack... But it should work.\n\nA: If you're using an Xubuntu distribution with xfce 4.8, you should be able to disable it from the Settings Manager.  Click the icon for Panel, and there should be a drop-down list.  Select the panel that corresponds to the panel you want to remove, and click the delete button beside it:\n\n\nA: You can remove the xfce4-panel from your start up applications. That way, when your system logs you in, xfce4-panel will never be started.\n", "Q: Successfully installed 11.04 64bit on two amd 32bit laptops--How is that possible? & Differences between i386 and amd64? Just as the title reads i can't quite understand how it works flawlessly. From what i know the 32bit  OS works on both 32bit & 64bit processors but 64bit OS only work on 64bit. So how is it possible that it works? I also noticed, when downloading the ISO, from the Ubuntu site that the 64bit version had some 'amd64' along its name and the 32bit version 'i386'. Does the 'i' stand for Intel?      \n\nA: Short answer: Your laptops have 64bit CPUs.\nWhen we talk about 64bit, we're talking about x86-64. This is an extension to i686 developed by AMD. They since went on to rename it to amd64 and since then a billion more names (including: x64, IA-32e and Intel 64) have come into being... But they all mean the same thing. (Sidebar: IA-64 is completely different and has very little to do with x86)\nTo repeat: x86-64 is an extension. It has all the CPU registers that an i686 CPU has, but with extra ones. An i686 CPU has all those of an i586 CPU, with extras. The same repeats down to i386. The purpose of this \"super-setting\" of registers/instructions is to keep things completely backwards compatible.\nTo translate this out of Geekish, 64bit CPUs can run everything a 32bit CPU can. I suspect this is what has happened to you and this is where the confusion has arisen. I suspect you had 32bit operating systems installed on the laptops before. A 64bit CPU is more than capable of doing this.\nBut 32bit CPUs cannot run 64bit code. They have neither the vocabulary or the capacity to run 64bit-compiled commands.\nSo in order for your laptops to run x86-64-compiled software, they need to be x86-64 CPUs. It just wouldn't work otherwise.\nIf you disagree, edit your question to include the make and model of the laptops, and I'll confirm the hardware specs...\nAnd i386 stands for \"Intel 80386\", as you guessed.\n\nA: The i does indeed stand for Intel and the 386 stands for the Intel 80386 CPU which is long obsolete. This label refers to the instruction set that Intel used for its 386, and beyond, line of CPUs. AMD designed their own CPUs to run that Intel 386 instruction set. Which is why the Windows and Linux operating systems run on both Intel and AMD CPUs. We do not need a special version for Intel and AMD.\nOne the other hand, AMD was first to develop the i386 instruction set to fully exploit the capabilities of 64bit CPUs with Intel having to follow AMD's lead. This is why one of the designations of a 64bit OS is amd64. It does not mean that we need a version of the OS for AMD CPUs and another one for Intel CPUs.\nIt also explains why a 32bit OS will run on 64bit AMD and Intel CPUs. The 64bit OS is a development of the 32bit OS and backwards compatibility was designed in. It most definitely should not work the other way around.\nRegards.\n\nA: First of all, to have a 32-bit only AMD laptop, it would have to be with Athlon XP-M CPU, which would mean that it'd have to be 6-9 years old. Any newer Athlon mobile CPUs, like for example Turion were 64-bit (which are backwards compatible with 32-bit, so they can run both 64- and 32-bit code). \ni386 means Intel architecture, also known as x86. It's a 32-bit architecture.  \namd64 means 64-bit extension of x86 architecture, it was originally created by AMD. It was previously  known as x86-64, but later AMD64 and Intel 64 diverged a bit and AMD renamed it. Intel still uses name x86-64. \n\nA: The most plausive case is that you didn't know, but your computer support 64-bit architecture, to see if it's true type in the terminal:\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nThen see the \"flags\" output, if there is one entry named lm (i.e. Long Mode) your CPU 64-bit, if don't it's 32-bit. Hope it helps!\n", "Q: What's the best lightweight dock for Lubuntu? I'm looking for a dock supporting not only launchers but also a list of currently running apps that is fairly lightweight and suited for Lubuntu install.\n\nA: Plank\n\nTo install add the ppa ppa:ricotz/docky and install plank from the software center.\n\nA: Wbar is lightweight and won't install unwanted dependencies. It's quite customizable yet simple.\n\nA: Use lxpanel to make a dock - http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-screencast-lxpanel-2-panel-layout\n\nA: Docky\nDocky is a great dock which if used in combination with the the light-weight compositor xcompmgr provides a simple customisable dock.  It does install the mono-libraries but I havent noticed any sizable increase in resource usage.\n\nSome simple docklets come as standard e.g. clipper and clock as shown.  For other applications, you can pin them to the dock to launch them.\nCairo\nMore customisable but needs effort to start with is Cairo-dock.  Out of the box, it assumes you have various default gnome applications.  You will need to either remove these or edit the applet to launch the Lubuntu equivalent.  But, personnally, I think the small amount of effort is greatly outweighed by the great 3D effects - use it with the light-weight compositor xcompmgr.\n\nAlso Consider\nAWN was always a favourite of mine under Gnome - however avoid this one for Lubuntu because Synaptic tries to install most of the Gnome desktop when installing AWN.\nHowever, if AWN is installed from the command line using the command \"sudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator --no-install-recommends\" it doesn't install all the Gnome packages, but it will take some manual tweaking after install as you'll need to install the packages for whatever applets you want one-by-one.  Doing it this way does give you AWN with a very light install size.\nWBar - various people have raved about this.  Personally, don't know why - it really is just a very light-weight launcher. No additional applets come with it.  All of the configuration you have to do via manually modifying a text configuration file.\n", "Q: Configuring Kubuntu to avoid mouse moving off the right edge of the screen I just installed Kubuntu. The hardware includes two current generation ATI graphics cards in crossfire configuration. I have only one monitor plugged in. Kubuntu's Display and Monitor settings correctly identifies that I have only one screen; the multiple monitors section says so directly. \nNevertheless, when I move my cursor past the right edge of the screen, it can move what appears to be approximately one full screen width beyond my visible desktop.\nI have also observed one program centering a message in a location that appears to be centered at the right edge of my screen, i.e in the middle of my actual monitor and the imaginary monitor.\nI guess there are some settings somewhere, used only by the mouse and this one program, that thinks there is a second monitor.

Where can I get one of these.\n\nA: One solution is if you have a mobile phone with bluetooth/wifi and touchscreen, then you can use that to control many Ubuntu applications, including Evince, LibreOffice Impress, Totem and Banshee. Many others are supported and you can add them yourself. It's a little bit complicated to configure, but doable. You'll need to install Anyremote on your PC and the Anyremote client on your phone.

I am trying to build a custom cd using uck. Now, i want to upgrade the kernel, remove the old kernel and then create the iso. I am able to upgrade the kernel but I am not able to switch to the new kernel as I cannot reboot ( as its a chroot session). \nIs it possible to switch to the new kernel and remove the old kernel?\n\nA: In the ISO image, updating the Kernel will create problems with all packages related to that version of the kernel. It is like a waterfall effect. You change the kernel and any packages in your ISO that have relation with the old kernel might show problems when installing them.\nIn any case I also tried to upgrade the kernel, my case was 2.6.36 to 2.6.39.

Press C to enter console mode. Then type (for Ubuntu versions before 18.04): \n$ vbeinfo\n\nFor Ubuntu 18.04 and later:\n$ videoinfo\n\nThis will display various stuff how grub recognizes your display.  At the bottom is \"preferred mode\" - in your case it should say 1280x800.  Note down the value. \nNote: sometimes, some buggy video cards incorrectly give Grub the wrong preferred resolution - if the preferred mode is much higher than you were expecting, then select the nearest mode in the list displayed that you were expecting.\nPress Esc to return to grub and press Enter to boot.\nStep 2: Setting the resolution in grub\nReach for your terminal and type\n$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nfind the line\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nremove the # and change 640x480 with the preferred mode you wrote down. E.g.:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800\n\nsave, then type\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nNote: the preferred mode has to be among those listed by vbeinfo.  For example, if your preferred mode is 1920x1080 (a common 16x9 aspect ratio setting), your preferred mode is NOT supported by vbeinfo and may not work correctly.  In fact, there do not seem to be any 16x9 modes supported by vbeinfo, as of Ubuntu 13.04. In that case you could try falling back to something common like 640x480, which, it seems most monitors support and vbeinfo supports.  Also, not all the modes supported by vbeinfo are necessarily supported by your monitor and you may have to experiment.\n\nA: I am running 14.04LTS on an ASUS M51AC with an Nvidia 625GT OEM. I found that in addition to the accepted answer, I needed to also add the line:\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD=\"keep\"\n\nto /etc/default/grub.\n\nA: For me on Ubuntu 17.10 server it was\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=\"keep\"\nGRUB_GFXMODE=\"1920x1080x32\"\n\nI also had to set the following to prevent shutdown from hanging\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n\n\nA: Grub Customizer:\nEasy to use Grub2 settings customizer.

Problem:\nI was downloading a file over Transmission when I noticed that the Transmission window was grayed out and not responding. On clicking it, Ubuntu (10.04) asked to force-close which I did. What remains is a zombie process that uses 100% of 1 CPU, and that's pretty much stopping my little machine dead in its tracks. top and System Monitor look very much the same as the screenshots in this related question. \nSteps taken:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I tried right-clicking the zombie in System Monitor and select \"Kill\" but nothing happened. \n\n*Rebooting seems to work, except that it happens again when I restart Transmission. \n\n*I see in System Monitor that it has a PID, 5 digits. I tried sudo kill {the PID} but nothing happened. (I don't know my way around Linux so I didn't try kill with any parameters.)\n\n*Now, I'm simply not starting Transmission again until I know how to deal with this. \n\n*I'm guessing that if I remove all Transmission downloads and reboot, then it would work again, perhaps until I try download some problematic file again?\n\n\nQuestion:\nIt's clear that I can't kill this zombie without rebooting. (Or can I?) How can I avoid this zombie? What is causing Transmission to break down?\n\n\n*\n\n*Update 1: I now tried sudo kill -9 {the PID} and it didn't seem to do anything. A minute later the zombie was gone, and the grey Transmission window too. I started Transmission again, and it seems to run now. Very odd?\n\n*Update 2: I just waited a looong time, and it seems to have cleared itself up. Wondering if perhaps I was just being impatient, but I thought that an Intel i5 with 2GB RAM ought to be able to handle simple browsing plus Transmission. Should I just delete this question? It seems to have imploded.\n\n*Update 3: This seems to be unrelated to number of downloads (I had only one active), and to rate limits (it happened in both cases). But it's difficult to give useful updates, as it seems to be working fine now. I'll reboot and start Transmission again, then see if it misbehaves again.\n\n\nA: sudo kill -9 {the PID}\n\nThat should do it. But use with care - could be leave the system in a messed up state as with that the process has no way to handle dying in any manner that would be graceful.\n\nA: The command to kill a process that does not respond to a basic kill command is to force kill it with \n$ killall process_name -KILL\nThis will terminate any zombies or any processes not responding to standard kill command.\n", "Q: Determining number of files in Ubuntu One Is there a way of telling in Ubuntu One how many files I have in each folder without having to do a manual count?\n\nA: When you log in to the Website it shows how many files you have and how much storage they use. – Uri Herrera Jul 22 '11 at 12:47\n", "Q: Permission denied error in transmission after formatting drive to ext4 I use transmission to download torrents to /media/serier/ (so not my home folder).

With those permissions, only root can descend into the folder. You need to set the execute bit on the folder, so you can enter it. To do so, execute:\nsudo chmod o+x /media/serier\n\nThe previous command sets the permissions from 700 to 701 (rwx-----x). Now you can descend into it, but not read the folder as a regular user. That might be annoying if you use a file browser to get into that folder, so I recommend to set the read bit too. Of course, it does not make sense to grant the world more permissions to the group, so set the same bits for the group too:\nsudo chmod go+rx /media/serier\n\nThe permissions will be set from 700 to 755 (rwxr-xr-x) and you can now descend into the directory and list the contents of it.\n\nA: An incompetent sysadmin would simply chmod 777 everything till it worked. (Don't do that)\nMake sure that everything previous folder.name is either 755 or owned by you.\n In case you don't know what 755 means.. (755 == rwxr-xr-x), note that directories need execution in ordered to be ls'ed.\nLook at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Octal_notation \nIf this doesn't help, we're going to need to see an error message to diagnose further.\n\nA: I just found out an issue that if u are using USB Drive or Network Drive.\nIt must be a permission issue on mounting them.

These packages contain instructions for installing and removing software from the system.\nThis system is controlled via apt, apt-get, aptitude, or the Synaptic Package Manager GUI (a front-end for apt-get and dpkg).  Installation is as simple as specifying what package(s) to install, and removal is similar.\nThere is also a Software center in Ubuntu.  This software center is for the less-tech-savvy user, but has the same results as my aforementioned methods for managing packages.

As my keyboard layout doesn't suit me, I run xmodmap on login. The script is named .profile and it runs OK, but it breaks the Unity interface.\nI want to know where to put the xmodmap line so that it executes on my login and doesn't break anything. \nI have already tried putting it in the .bash_login and .bash_profile files, without success (xmodmap doesn't set my keyboard).\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: The correct place to put xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap (so that your changes are read at startup) is in ~/.xinitrc (see explanation below), although you could alternately place the xmodmap command as a startup item (/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/user/.Xmodmap). I can say that for 12.04 (and presumably 12.10) that these two alternatives definitely do work, as either way they are read after you log in with lightdm. (I changed Return to Right Shift, and the change only took effect after entering my password and logging in).\nPlease note: if you are on Xfce, it is noted on the official Xfce FAQ that you may have to create a startup item instead of using ~/.xinitrc, and that you might have to delay the execution so the xmodmap changes are not overwritten by setxkbmap. You can use a delay to achieve this in your startup entry:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 20; /usr/bin/xmodmap /home/$USER/.Xmodmap\"\n\n(For the startup entry it is necessary to specify absolute paths)\nEach time setxkbmap is run to change keyboard layout, you will have to run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap again in the terminal.\nCreating ~/.xinitrc\nCreate a file in your home folder called .xinitrc with\ntouch .xinitrc\n\nand place in it:\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nYour Xmodmap file should not have entries in the xmodmap -e \" \" style as that is used in the terminal for temporarily setting the values. It must have entries in this format:\nkeycode 65 = Tab\nkeycode 23 = Space\n\nIt is often confusing which of the various X files (such as .xprofile, .xinitrc, etc) are read at startup, but .xinitrc does seem to be still read under 12.04, whereas .Xmodmap or .xinputrc are not read by themselves.\n\nA: I don't have the unity interface in front of me just now, but try clicking the Applications button on the launcher, then type startup. \nThere should be an app called Startup Applications (or some such). Click it and add your xmodmap command (eg xmodmap /home/thiago/.Xmodmap).\nIt is important to use absolute path, not ~/Xmodmap.\nIf it still doesn't work, you can try adding a bit of delay as suggested by hxpax.\n\nA: On Mint 17/18, I can achieve that bu put my scripts into the Startup Application, with 1 second delay.\nAs Mint 18 is derived from Ubuntu 1604, I think you can do the same, or install Startup Application managing panel first if it is not there.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I wasn't having much joy with any of the suggestions above (the .bashrc option wasn't really viable as it runs xmodmap on every new terminal)\nI touched a script called xmodstartup.sh in my home folder\n  #!/bin/bash           \n  sleep 1;               \n  echo \"running xmodmap\" \n  xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap     \n\nwith it saved, I then did sudo chmod +x xmodstartup.sh\nthen I simply added the executable file to gnome's \"startup application preferences\" window.  bish bosh, English layout y Español on altgr :) \n\nA: For gnome3:\nxinitrc starts with /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc and contains only one command: . /etc/X11/Xsession\nThis global Xsession file sets paths that are being executed:\n    USERXSESSION=$HOME/.xsession\n    USERXSESSIONRC=$HOME/.xsessionrc\n\nI put echo $(date) >> ~/sesscheck in $USERXSESSIONRC to check if this file is being executed on gnome login. It works. However, if you put xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap instead of test file record, keys mapping stays default. It means that default xmodmap overrides settings when xinitrc already started.\nAs said above by @kontrollanten, the most reliable way is to create a .desktop  file and put it into ~/.config/autostart directory.\nDesktop entry example, modifying keymap after Gnome user login:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Correct keys layout\nExec=/usr/bin/xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=false\nCategories=Application;\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nIn my case, I lost numpad functionality at all and needed to map numpad keycodes to exact digits. So, ~/.Xmodmap is:\nkeycode  87 = 1 1 1 1 1 1\nkeycode  83 = 4 4 4 4 4 4\nkeycode  79 = 7 7 7 7 7 7\nkeycode  80 = 8 8 8 8 8 8\nkeycode  84 = 5 5 5 5 5 5\nkeycode  88 = 2 2 2 2 2 2\nkeycode  81 = 9 9 9 9 9 9\nkeycode  89 = 3 3 3 3 3 3\nkeycode  85 = 6 6 6 6 6 6\nkeycode  90 = 0 0 0 0 0 0\nkeycode  86 = plus plus plus plus plus plus\nkeycode  82 = minus minus minus minus minus minus\nkeycode  91 = period period period period period period\n\n\nA: I'm using ElementaryOS (with its GNOME based window manager) and found a solution through using xdg autostart scripts. Many window managers are using xdg so I assume this approach also will work in other environments. At least it should work with GNOME.\nxdg run scripts in ~/.config/autostart upon login in a X session. To load xmodmap config upon login, add the following script to ~/.config/autostart/xmodmap.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName[en_US]=Xmodmap\nComment[en_US]=xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\nExec=/usr/bin/xmodmap .Xmodmap\nIcon=application-default-icon\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nType=Application\n\nThen logout and login again, and your Xmodmap configuration should've been loaded.\nIf it's not working, try to run xmodmap in terminal to see if it's xmodmap that complains:\n$ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nIf you don't get any error, run the following command to debug:\n$ sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep -B 5 -A 5 xmodmap\n\n\nA: Seems that even .config/autostart is a bit finicky. Jay had a good solution but I've realized you could put the commands in xmodmap.desktop while just making sure to sleep the 1 second without having to make the extra bash script.\nName[en_US]=Xmodmap\nComment[en_US]=xmodmap ~/.xmodmap\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 1; /usr/bin/xmodmap .xmodmap\"\nIcon=application-default-icon\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nType=Application```\n\n\nA: Putting xmodmap changes in ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc doesn't break anything.\nOnly downside is that one has to open a terminal after each boot to get it activated.\n", "Q: How do I change the theme?

I am very paranoid about wireless connections and someone stealing my broadband bandwidth, which could lead to worse things.\nMy question is, how can I detect if my broadband bandwidth is being stolen?\nI have a Belkin SURF+ N300 wireless router.\nIdeally, it would be cool if I would get alerted automatically, but if that is not possible, then a manual process would be fine.\n\nA: My suggestion, Oli's 1.\nIf your \"attacker\" gains access without needing to spoof his mac address, he'll assume you thats theres no way you're monitoring your MAC addresses.\nUse your own dhcpd with an event to trigger an email if necessary.\nI am going to have to do some research, but if it were me, I would run my own dhcpd on a linux box connected to the router (or use openwrt), and then have it email me if there if a macaddress requests an address whats not on a whitelist.\nEDIT: http://linux.die.net/man/5/dhcpd.conf has all the resources you need to get this done. Just create an event to execute a script that will check on a whitelist, if the mac address is not on the whitelist, have it send yourself an email.\nAlso see\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1328967\n\nA: I've got three ideas for you. They all have their share of complexity and you can mix and match as you see fit. The first is probably the easiest, but least robust (on its own).\n1. Passive MAC detection\nThe standard way would be to keep track of the MAC addresses that are requesting DHCP addresses from the router. Most routers provide an \"Attached Devices\" style screen that will tell you who's connecting.\nThis isn't automatic, but you could (fairly easily) script some Bash/Python to pull the router page down, parse out the MAC addresses and check them against a list of known/allowed MAC addresses.\nThe problem here is nothing is instant. You rely on the router to update its page and you have to poll this frequently. Some routers won't like this. I have a crappy Edimax router that crashes if you load more than 10 pages in a minute (pathetic!) so this might not work.\nMAC addresses are also woefully spoofable. macchanger for example, will let you spoof your MAC address in one command. I think even Network Manager will let you do it. If somebody doesn't want to be detected, they'll monitor network traffic and spoof one of the valid (known) devices.\n2. Active Sniffing\nThis is where we rip the wheels off and dig in. You'll need a spare wireless something-or-other in a place that can intercept traffic to/from the router (ideally quite close to it).\nIn short, you hook up airodump-ng and you watch people connected to your network. It should be possible to script this output so when a new device shows up and starts using your network, you can instantly do something.\nThe idea would be that you run this on boot (as root):\nairmon-ng start wlan0\nairodump-ng --bssid 00:1F:9F:14:6F:EB -w output --output-format csv mon0\n\nReplace the BSSID with your access point's.\nThis writes an auto-incrementing file that can be parsed on a regular basis. The version above write a comma-separated value file which is quite basic but if you're happy with XML (Python can make it pretty simple) you might want to look at the netxml output format for airodump.\nEither way, this gives you regular information about which devices are using the network (and how much traffic they're sending too). It's still just as fallible as using the router's ARP table, but it's live.\nWhile you're in promiscuous mode, if your script does pick up a client it thinks shouldn't be on the network, you could use tcpdump to trawl the packets and log exchanges of interest (HTTP requests, etc). It's more programming but it can be done.\n3. Fingerprinting with nmap\nAnother method is to sweep the network for clients with nmap. Normally, you might think, this wouldn't help you too much, if somebody is blocking pings, it might not show up.\nI suggest you use this in conjunction with either of the two other methods. 1 will give you the IP address so you can nmap directly. 2 won't give you an IP but it will let you know how many clients nmap should expect to find, at that exact moment in time. Make sure all your devices are pingable.\nWhen nmap runs (eg sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.1/24) it will try to find hosts and then it will do a port-scan on them to work out what they are. Your check-list should include how each of your devices should respond to nmap.\nIf you want to go one further, you could run a simple server on each of your computers. Just something that accepted a connection and then dropped it. In short: Something for nmap to look for. If it finds it open, it's probably your computer.\n4. Secure your network better\nYou should actually do this first if you're worried. Use WPA2/AES. Never use WEP (cracks in about five minutes).\nIf you're still worried somebody might find out the key (WPA2 takes a lot of data and computational time to crack), move to a RADIUS model. It's an authentication framework that sets up a one-time key for each user. PITA to set up though.\nBut which to do..?\nIf I weren't happy with things, I'd probably manually watch airodump. If I still wasn't happy, I'd start fingerprinting things I saw. Somewhat difficult (by no means impossible) to script though.\nThe easiest to script is going to be router-scraping with fingerprinting from nmap. Short and simple.\n", "Q: How to Roll back newly applied LTS Maintenance Upgrade to the Previous Version Is there a way to roll back a LTS Maintenance Upgrade to the previous version, say from 10.04.02 LTS from 10.04.03 LTS ?\nI am not facing a problem now, but need to figure out means to back out the packages before I rollover to 10.04.03 LTS on my server, in case of any need.\n\nA: Note that the point releases of 10.04 are just roll-ups of the packages from the security and updates archives.  If you have been regularly applying the updates to your server (which is the recommended behaviour), you are probably already at the new point release.\nIf you have upgraded to a package that is causing you problems, you can downgrade a package.  You can discover what versions of a package are available with the following command:\napt-cache policy PACKAGE_NAME\n\nNote the version numbers it lists for each archive.  You can install a specific version of a package with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGE_NAME=VERSION_NUMBER\n\nYou will be warned that you are downgrading the package.\n\nA: There is no one step process to roll-back all the updates done in a point release to the previous one.

It installed perfectly but on completion, after the reboot, the boot menu shows just 'memtest' and windows 7 as options - no option for loading ubuntu. \n\nA: (I expect this question will be moved to Ask Ubuntu, but I'll throw this answer on while we wait).\nFirst, boot to a live cd to make sure your installed Ubuntu partition is still there (I fully expect it to be).\nSecond, (assuming the 1st step showed you that you still have an Ubuntu install) look at your partition table and your grub.conf file - make sure it's the grub.conf file of your installed system, not the live cd :)  You may just have to manually write in the line for your Ubuntu partition.

Changing the boot device priority can grant you access to that bootloader.\nIf that is not the problem, you should try restoring grub following this tutorial\nhttp://ubuntuguide.net/how-to-restore-grub-2-after-reinstalling-windows-xpvistawin7\n(i know that its title says \"after installing windows\" but , of course, the steps used there are just as good for reinstalling grub after any problem)\n\nA: If you've got a live CD, you can try the following command out in the terminal after choosing Trying Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install grub  //firstly install grub \nsudo grub  //launch it   \nfind /boot/grub/menu.lst   \nroot (hdx,y) //this depends on where you install you ubuntu\nsetup (hdx) //now install the grub into the mbr  \nquit  \nrestart\nif you load into the grub prompt \nroot (hdx,y)\nkernel /boot/vmlinuz--generic ro root=/dev/sda7 //sda7=(hd0,6), replace it with your own \ninitrd /boot/initrd.img--generic   \nboot \nno need to remember the kernel version, just use tab to help you \nI've just done this to dual boot my win7 (on sda1) and ubuntu 11.04 (on sda5) \nIt will be helpful if you post your /boot/grub/menu.lst here.   \nWell, without the Live CD try to search for grub4dos to boot ubuntu with the windows bootloader\n", "Q: USB hard drive sleeps even when in use I have very small ARM computer with Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) running as a backup and media server for my house. \nI have attached a new \"WD My Passport\" 750GB USB drive to it.

My network is called \"linksys\" (don't blame me, someone else set it up), and I know for a fact it is secured by WPA2 Personal. I am in fact connected to it on a different machine (also running Kubuntu 11.04) on the same network as I type this right now.\nI also know the network card works with this OS. I just had a different install of Kubuntu 11.04 on it before, just reformatted and installed fresh. It was working fine on the old install.\nHere's what's happening. When I go to add a wireless network connection, and type \"linksys\" as the wireless SSID, then go to the wireless security tab, the dropdown for \"Security\" contains only the option \"None\". If I type in any other SSID, the Security dropdown is normal (containing options like WEP, WPA/WPA2 Personal, etc...). So it seems it is only not letting me select a security method for my network, \"linksys\". Almost like it has decided for some reason it is definitely not a secured network.\nBut it is. If I try to connect to it without selecting a security, it simply fails. And, as I said, I am connected to it right now on a different computer with the same OS using WPA2 Personal.\nAny reason why this might be happening?\n\nA: Strange issue, I have no clue about it.\nMaybe you should consider updating your fresh installed Kubuntu to fix any bugs\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI also recommend using Wicd instead of the default network manager,\nit is much better with more options and features.\nSimply install wicd from the konsole:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wicd\n\nThen restart and run it, and give it a try, most probably it will work.\nLast, you might need to disable the default network manager of KDE, or just\nuninstall it.\nsudo apt-get remove network-manager\n\nAnd don't forget to add wicd to your autostart list\nGood luck !\n", "Q: Synchronization of folders Ubuntu One I have shared a folder ubuntuone and I accepted. I go to panel ubuntuone, put synchronize that folder, put synchronize that folder, I can not find and synchronizable.

How do I switch back to Classic view from updated view? Installed with Classic view. It ran, but when updated it switched windows view. I cannot drag any apps to workspace and cannot install bars at top or bottom of workspace for apps.\n\nA: You are probably trying to ask about the way to move away from unity , back to classic gnome desktop.\nIf that is what you want to ask, you should log out from your user (from the \"power\" button at the top right of the screen) and log back in, after choosing \"classic desktop\" instead of \"ubuntu\".\n\nA: If you just want a bottom panel like in the old versions, but still have the nice things from Unity, then you can do the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal. (In Unity, press super/winkey and type \"terminal\").\n\n*Run\nmetacity --replace &\ngnome-panel &\n\n\n*You now have the old panels back. Delete the upper one and configure the lower one to suit your needs.  To delete the panel use the Alt-Super keys while mouse over the applications panel.\n\n*Configure gnome-panel to start automatically when you log in. You can do that in the Startup applications settings application by typing \"gnome-session-properties\". \nLet me explain this: \nYou run metacity --replace because that will temporarily deactivate Unity, including the top panel. By using & at the end of the command, you'll place it into the background so you can run other commands. You then run gnome-panel to get the old panels back, and you delete the upper panel because it'll conflict with the panel from Unity once you log back in. By adding gnome-panel to startup applications, the next time you log in, you'll have the Unity panel at the top, and the gnome-panel at the bottom. The best from both worlds, some might say, even though I won't be one of them. :)\nLog out and back in. You will now have both a bottom panel like you're used to from older versions of Ubuntu, and all the new stuff, like the launcher on the left, the Dash, etc.\n", "Q: Can i automatically kill any application that uses more than a certain percentage of the CPU and/or RAM?

I am looking for a way to multiboot windows, lubuntu (natty), and arch linux.\nI know how I could set it up, but I want to know the right way.\nRight now each distro has their own grub install, and their own /boot\nIs there a way to use the same /boot?\nOr maybe I should just uninstall the one from arch and have the lubuntu one do the job.\nEDIT: maybe I can chain load one to the other? That might not be the right way, but it's certainly an easy and maintainable solution.\nUpdate: so I did some research, and there are a two ways to do this.\nFirst off, I have grub1 on arch and grub2 on lubuntu (no particular reason, this is default)\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a single grub install from either distro.\n\n*chainload from one install to another by installing the grub bootloader onto a partition.\n\n\nFirst, I tried to do 2., but grub-install (grub2) gave me this big warning about installing onto partition, so I decided this was a bad idea.\nThen I figured that I could just use the grub1 install on ubuntu and grub-update would auto detect arch linux. So, I resintalled grub2 onto the MBR, but grub-update was not able to auto-detect arch.\n#So, my updated question is... \nwhat do I need to add to grub.d to either make it auto-detect arch, or just make a manual entry?\nThere is nothing wrong with a manual entry, but an example script that does this would be useful..\nEDIT: looks like it was a problem with chrooting into lubuntu from arch. I reran update-grub from lubuntu and it works fine now.\n\nA: From talking to the people in #archlinux, I got quite a few ideas on how to do this\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall grub from arch and simply use lubuntu's grub install. You would use lubuntu's grub install over archlinux's, because lubuntu changes kernel versions alot and has multiple entries in grub.cfg, etc.\n\n*Chainlink grub installs. See here. You need to do grub-install /dev/sdaN with grub2. It will complain about installing to a partition and fail, but I am sure there is a way to override this.\n\n*Use a single /boot. Arch and lubuntu grub2 installs can coexist. I didn't like this solution because it seems like kernel updates could overwrite one another. Maybe not with an ubuntu and Arch combo.. but certainly with other combos.\n\n*uninstall grub2 from lubuntu and use the grub1 install from Arch. And then use a symlink from /boot/kernel > /boot/actual_kernel_name. This requires manual tasks, so I opted against it.\n\n\nI ended up with 1.\nThis way update-grub will work correctly within lubuntu. If I ever need to update it in Arch I can always use grub-mkconfig /mnt/lubuntu/boot/grub.cfg (actually, this will use Arch's grub.d and I don't want to have to maintain two of them. hmm.)\n", "Q: Complete LinuxMint theme for ubuntu I am using the Ubuntu 11.04 with unity from the day of it's release.

It uses the command 'radio' for tuning, but the command seems to be running in order for the radio to work (i.e. I can't just tune it then forget about it). \nUnfortunately, if I try to use a wrapper that runs the command in the backgroup, it doesn't seem to work, as it is ncurses based, and doesn't seem to like being run in batch mode.\nLike xvfb can be used to 'fake' an X session, can I do the same for ncurses?\n\nA: To add to Oli's answer\nscreen -d -m -S nameOfScreen /path/to/exe  #this is for scripting use\n\nThis is all in man screen and it's not too hard to figure out\nYou should try to find a screen tutorial to give you a once over though.\nThis one doesn't seem too bad.\n\nA: You could spawn a screen (sudo apt-get install screen) session that you can then detach from.\nNo idea how you'd script the detachment but it should work for keeping a ncurses application running in the background.\n\nA: Direct the output to /dev/null ; this will probably keep it \"happy\" about not having a terminal.\nradioapp -option /etc 2>&1 > /dev/null\n", "Q: Is there a Tomboy fork which allows embedding images (or files)? Is there an application that works exactly like Tomboy which allows you to embed images (or files)into the notes? Not links to the images, but actually in the note itself. \n\nA: I don't believe there is a fork of Tomboy that will enable you to insert images.\nHowever, if you are looking for a similar note-keeping software then can I recommend KeepNote.  This will work on Ubuntu as well as Windows.\nHere is a screen-shot - note the ability to embed images directly into the note.\n\n\nA: Maybe The Board is what you’re looking for, although not exactly a TomBoy replacement…\n\nA: Zim \nZim is an alternate personal wiki tool, allows images to be inserted, using the attach option from the menu or toolbar.\n\n\nA: tomboy does not allow to insert images, but there is and add-in for inserting latex equations.

Sometimes, a graphical text editor like gedit or kate cannot be used (because you're in a virtual console for example). Luckily, there are text editors for the terminal. An easy one is nano, but I cannot understand how to work with it.\nIf I start nano by running nano, the bottom text is supposed to help me but all I see are things like ^G Get Help    ^O WriteOut.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I open text files for editing?\n\n*How can I save the file?\n\n*How can I quit the editor without saving the changes?\n\n*How to edit? I heard that you've to enter some commands to begin editing in vi, is this true for nano too?\n\n*Sometimes, if I manage to open a file, the text is unreadable due to its colors. How can I disable these colors? (see the image below)\n\n*In the some files, lines are truncated because those do not fit in the screen. How can I prevent that from happening? (see the image below)\n\n\n\n\nA: Ctrl + G will let you read the help. nano can do some pretty nice things so you might want to pootle around in there for a bit.\nWhen you see ^G (et al) it means Ctrl + G. In the help pages, M-H means Alt + H.\nHow can I open text files for editing?\nThis is the default in nano. Open and file and you're set to start editing:\nnano filename\n\nNote: you won't be able to save unless you have write permissions for that file.\nHow can I save the file?\nF3 will let you save without exiting. Otherwise, Ctrl + X will prompt you if you've made changes. Press Y when it asks, and Enter to confirm the filename.\nHow can I quit the editor without saving the changes?\nCtrl + X, then N when it asks if you want to save.\nHow to edit? I heard that you've to enter some commands to begin editing in vi, is this true for nano too?\nAs above, no. nano is simple. It drops you in edit mode as soon as it opens. You can use arrow keys, Page Up / Page Down and Home / End as in gedit. You cannot use the mouse for moving the cursor position.\nSometimes, if I manage to open a file, the text is unreadable due to its colors. How can I disable these colors?\nColours are loaded through the nanorc framework. These are files that are loaded when nano loads which basically spell out the syntax highlighting. To toggle syntax highlighting, press Alt + Y. To disable it permanently for certain file types, edit /etc/nanorc and put a hash mark (#) before include \"/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc\".\nIn the some files, lines are truncated because those do not fit in the screen. How can I prevent that from happening?\nWell I've been trying to find something but the best I could see was enabling soft-line-wrap with the funky key-combination of: Alt + $ (Alt + Shift + 4).\nTo enable soft line wrapping by default, add the below line to ~/.nanorc:\nset softwrap\n\nMore information about this configuration file can be found at man nanorc.\n\nA: In the bottom text the ^ stands for Ctrl and M- stands for Alt\nSo^G is Ctrl-G and M-Y is Alt-Y (that one toggles the colors). \nYou can toggle line truncation with M-$. See the help pages (^G) for more functions.\n\nA: The combination of ^ and a letter means you're supposed to press Ctrl and that letter. So when nano says ^X Exit that means you're gonna quit nano by pressing Ctrl+X.\n\n\n*\n\n*To open a file called /etc/nanorc you can start nano with:\nnano /etc/nanorc\n\nNote that /etc/groups is not writeable by regular users, therefore you need sudo:\nsudo nano /etc/nanorc\n\nIf you've already opened nano, you can press Ctrl+R to open a file.\n\n*On exit (Ctrl+X) nano will ask you whether to save the file. You can save it manually with F3.\n\n*Answer n for no in the Ctrl+X dialogue.\n\n*Basic editing is done by using the arrow keys to navigate and typing. Plain and simple.\n\n*Syntax highlighting is disabled in a hidden file called .nanorc in your home directory along with other options. Alt+Y toggles it.\n\n*In the aforementioned .nanorc you can add the line set fill 80 which will break long lines at 80 characters length. Alt+M toggles it.\n\n\nHere is a list of stettings you can configure in .nanorc.\n\nA: CtrlX: Exit the editor. If you've edited text without saving, you'll be prompted as to whether you really want to exit.\nCtrlO: Write (output) the current contents of the text buffer to a file. A filename prompt will appear; press CtrlT to open the file navigator shown above.\nCtrlR: Read a text file into the current editing session. At the filename prompt, hit CtrlT for the file navigator.\nCtrlK: Cut a line into the clipboard. You can press this repeatedly to copy multiple lines, which are then stored as one chunk.\nCtrlJ: Justify (fill out) a paragraph of text. By default, this reflows text to match the width of the editing window.\nCtrlU: Uncut text, or rather, paste it from the clipboard. Note that after a Justify operation, this turns into unjustify.\nCtrlT: Check spelling.\nCtrlW: Find a word or phrase. At the prompt, use the cursor keys to go through previous search terms, or hit CtrlR to move into replace mode. Alternatively you can hit CtrlT to go to a specific line.\nCtrlC: Show current line number and file information.\nCtrlG: Get help; this provides information on navigating through files and common keyboard commands.\n\nA: You are asking that question because you are used to modern text editors with Ctrl+x, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v, Ctrl+z, and marking using shift+arrows. You can quickly transform your ugly nano into a modern CLI editor.\nJust create the file ~/.nanorc with these key bindings:\nset atblanks            # don't cut words when doing line wrap\nset nohelp              # don't display help footer\nset softwrap            # don't break lines\nset suspend             # don't suspend the shell\nset tabsize 4           # tab stops every 4 spaces\nset tabstospaces        # convert tabs to spaces\nset constantshow        # show constants\nset linenumbers         # show line numbers Alt+N to toggle\nset casesensitive       # case sensitive\nset zap                 # zap to the end of the line\nset autoindent          # auto indent\nset indicator           # show the cursor position\nset minibar             # show the minibar\nset nonewlines          # don't insert newlines\n#set backup             # don't make backups\n#set backupdir \"/tmp\"   # where to put the backups\n\nbind ^X cut main        # CTRL+X - Cut\nbind ^C copy main       # CTRC+C - Copy\nbind ^V paste all       # CTRL+V - Past\nbind ^Q exit all        # CTRL+Q - Quit program\nbind ^S savefile main   # CTRL+S - Save\nbind ^Z undo all        # CTRL+Z - Undo\nbind ^Y redo all        # CTRL+Y - Redo\nbind ^H replace main    # CTRL+H - Replace\nbind ^F whereis main    # CTRL+F - Find\nbind F3 findnext main   # F3     - Find next\nbind ^/ comment main    # CTRL+/ - Comment\n\ninclude /usr/share/nano/*\n\nIt will become something really close to micro editor, but with a tiny footprint.\n", "Q: Use headphone+microphone ports for 2.1 sound I have a laptop with a headphone and microphone port based on the following sound card: 00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio [8086:3b56] (rev 05)\nRecently some 2.1 speakers found their way in to my possession, as these things do. I'm not using them for much at the moment but while we're moving house (we're going to be staying with friends for a week or two) I'd like to be able to have some decent sound, even if it's only 2.1.\nGiven that the laptop only has two ports and one of those is a microphone, I wondered if there's any way that I can re-purpose the microphone port and turn it into LFE port for the subwoofer. I'm sure I've seen this done before a while back (it was probably when I used Windows, all those years ago). I realise being able to do this is hardware specific.\nFailing that, does anybody know a nice (cheap!) USB sound card that Ubuntu will cope with being plugged in and unplugged while running, and will give me 2.1?\n\nA: You might be able to change the internal connections with HDA Analyzer, although it looks a bit daunting, and I couldn't find any good documentation for it. It has a \"Graph\" button which shows the circuitry, and you can hover and right click there, but finding out what you should connect to what looks like it's going to be a lot of trial and error.\nIt's also in a PPA, see http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.alsa.devel/85051/match=hda+analyzer.\n", "Q: Hardening my Ubuntu 10.04 OS against ungraceful shutdowns There's a system that a customer has that runs our software that is just going to be powered off at arbitrary times. UPS is not an option because the unit is moved from place to place. \nThink of it as a psuedo-embedded system. It's headless and has no internet/lan connections, meaning that until the customer followed our instructions to remotely debug, no one had so much as logged in for several boot cycles before the problem arose.\nThe system uses, among other things, USB to serial converters running FTDI drivers. Recently the system was working great, and as expected, was powered off, then came up using uhci_hcd drivers for USB to serial converters.\nClearly something went wrong on shutdown and left the filesystem in some sort of bad shape.\nIs there any way around this? I'm not concerned about guarantees for our software, I want to guarantee OS stability and consistency.\nDo we need to rethink Ubuntu 10.04?  I know it's a bit overkill if we don't even log in 99% of the time, but the driver support seems a little better and the installation is perhaps a little nicer than other distributions.\nDoes anyone have experience hardening a system in this manner? Things on my list would include automatically resolving file system checks with no user interaction, uninstalling unneeded packages that might cause configuration/timing issues, etc. \nTo be clear, data loss is NOT a concern -- always booting up into the same configuration is a top priority.\nAny good resources for reading up on this? I don't even know what I would search for exactly -- I haven't done a ton in the way of hard core sysadmin stuff in the past.\n\nA: Most embedded devices will split their storage into several sections.  You could mount the OS partition read-only with a read-write ramdisk overlay -- any changes are not written to disk, so nothing to corrupt, and no possibility of the state changing on boot up.  Add an additional partition for any data you need to write persistently, and use (if you're using ext3/4, data=journal will help ensure data consistency beyond the normal journaling.)\nNote: you'll need the ramdisk overlay as many applications write various state files into /tmp or /var.\n", "Q: I want to make every window as transparent with font as opaque (as gnome terminal capabality) I want to make every window ]transparent with opaque text.\nI have done some search on the internet and the answer I got is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Compiz Config Settings Manager.\n\n*Click on Opacity, Brightness and Saturation in the Accessibility section.\n\n*Under 'Window specific settings' click 'New'\n\n*Type '(type=any)' into the 'Windows' text box and set 'Window values' to 20.\n\n\nThis works but makes the content of the window transparent (including the text) as well as the background.\nAnd also there are provided options to increase and decrease opacity. On the same page I am successfully able to utilise that feature by configuring keyboard shortcuts as well as mouse shortcuts, but I was not able to add a shortcut that uses the scrolling of the middle mouse button.\nI think these two feature would help me as well as Ubuntu to a great extent.\nRight now I am using Ubuntu 11.04. In 11.10 I heard GNOME 3 will be used and this uses Mutter. What happens to Compiz?\nAs a summary I have 3 questions\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I give every window a transparent background while keeping opaque content?\n\n*How can I use the mouse wheel to increase and decrease opacity?\n\n*What will happen to Compiz in 11.10?\n\nA: *\n\n*This is possible in GNOME, XFCE and LXDE with librgba, but it can cause problems with many programs (so much so that I stopped using it for now and don't recommend it any more). It is also possible in KDE with a special version of Oxygen, but I also would not recommend this as it is currently unsupported and possibly buggy.\n\n*You need assign the shortcuts to buttons 5 and 4 or 5 and 6 (usually). Sometimes however it may be other buttons, so keep trying till you find the correct buttons.\n\n*In 11.10 Compiz will still be used as a requirement for Unity, and probably with GNOME Classic. Mutter is used in GNOME Shell and can optionally be used with GNOME Classic and similar desktop environments.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When asking questions please keep it down to a single question.\n\n", "Q: Opened programs in Unity I noticed a problem on Unity.

However if I press CAPS + f, then it should move a line down (CAPS was configured as the command key).\n\nA: Well, at the link you provided, Paul explain how did he made it.\nA slight modified way to do this would be like this:  \n1) Alt + F2 and type gnome-keyboard-properties.\nThen go to Layouts > Options > Caps Lock key Behavior > \"Make Caps Lock an additional Super\"  \n2) Install compizconfig settings manager and xdotool.  \n3) Open ccsm (Alt + F2 and type `ccsm).\nThen go to Commands and set these commands and these shortcuts:  \n\nCommand 1\nsleep 0.1 && xdotool key \"Left\"  \nShortcut 1\nSuper+h  \n\nCommand 2\nsleep 0.1 && xdotool key \"Down\"  \nShortcut 2\nSuper+j  \n\nCommand 3\nsleep 0.1 && xdotool key \"Up\"  \nShortcut 3\nSuper+k  \n\nCommand 4\nsleep 0.1 && xdotool key \"Right\"  \nShortcut 4\nSuper+l  \n\nHope you enjoy ;-)\n", "Q: How do I update an ISO with zsync? The context here is the Oneric development ISO. I don't want to have to re-download this every time something changes. I notice that there's a .zsync file in the download directory. From what I know, this should let me update only the chunks that have changed, saving a ton of bandwidth.\nThe only problem is, I don't have a clue what I'm doing :) Could somebody push me in the right direction to keep oneiric-desktop-amd64.iso up to date?\n\nA: Testing daily builds with bandwidth caps, I started trying to figure out how to go about this.

In short: before unplugging a USB modem, should I take any action to make the removal safe?\nI received a HUAWEI-367, it worked great the first day. The next morning the modem was very warm and had no internet connection. I tried to re-connect but it did not work, however it was blinking and Ubuntu did recognize I had a USB modem plugged. So I unplugged it and re-plugged it. However now it was as if the usb-device had died.\nUbuntu no longer recognized it and no modem-lights were showing. I also tried plugging it in on a Mac and nothing was mounted. It could be that the device was a faulty one and broke due to the heat. However I am afraid that it was me unplugging it without first somehow unloading the device properly which caused it to break (perhaps writing random data to the firmware or something). On the other hand, I previously had a different HUAWEI model which I frequently unplugged and replugged without any problems.\nNow I would like to unplug my modem but I am not sure how to do it and I would not like to break another one.\n\nA: Your modem most likely had an electrical defect. There is certainly no firmware writing going on over usb unless you invoke specific software to do that. However, you might want to check the voltage on your usb ports. If it exceeds 5 V by much, your PC's power supply or some voltage regulator on your motherboard might be faulty.\nGenerally only hdds take unkindly to unpluggin as the buffer can not be written (dataloss) or the writehaed hits the disk resulting in scrates.\n", "Q: How do I make apache run a cgi instead of showing the text? I'm trying to install bugzilla 4 on ubuntu 11.04\nI've added the following to my httpd.conf\n<Directory “/var/www/dev.spincentre/bugzilla”>\n   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi\n   Options +Indexes +ExecCGI\n   DirectoryIndex index.cgi\n   AllowOverride Limit\n</Directory>\n\nBut when I go to the URL, apache shows the text of index.cgi instead of executing the script. Any idea how to fix it?\n\nA: When installing Apache 2.4 I had a number of issues to solve and also had the same issue with text showing instead of running the cgi. The solution is not the same as above, which is the solution for Apache 2.2\nFirst, you need to download the 2.4 gz file and unpack. If you try to compile, it will complain the APR is not found, since it is no longer included. You need to download the apr and apr-util files from Apache and unpack them into the directory you are compiling Apache into the subdirectory called srclib, so your path would be ./httpd/srclib/apr and ./httpd/srclib/apr-util. You must also remove any version numbers from the directory name.\ncd to your /path/httpd directory and the compile with\n$ ./configure --with-included-apr\n\nYour config will default to PREFIX=/usr/local/apache2\n$ make\n\n$ make install\n\n$ vi PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf\n\nYou will need to edit your httpd.conf file to get your cgi's to run\nIn my case I did the following:\nchange Listen 80 to Listen 127.0.0.1:80\nactivate the line:\nLoadModule cgid_module modules/mod_cgid.so\n\nchanged SeverName to:\nServerName 127.0.0.1:80\n\nchanged the paths in DocumentRoot and <Directory> to suit my system\nchanged the path in ScriptAlias\nenabled the line Scriptsock cgisock\nchanged the path in <Directory> after the ScriptAlias to suit my system\nenabled the line AddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nsaved the changes and started Apache with:\n$ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k start\n\nHope this helps anyone struggling with this ;)\n\nA: Did you load the mod_cgi module? You can see if the directory /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ has a symlink cgi.load. If there is no such symlink, you can create it by running\nsudo a2enmod cgi\n\nand then restart Apache:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nYou can run man a2enmod to see what a2enmod does.\n\nA: if your perl module is successfully running apache2, but when you open the page \nhttp://localhost/perl/mysite/ instead of displaying your file instead of executing the script, you only need to add a line of code to the .htaccess or apache configuration file,\nThat is :\nDirectoryIndex: index.pl index.html index.php\n\n", "Q: Color-leveling a tiff image via command-line From a script, I'm trying to apply some color levels to a grayscale .tiff image, the same as I would do in GIMP.\nI've tried using ImageMagick's convert tool:\nconvert input.tiff -level 102,200,0.85 output.tiff\n\nand also\nconvert input.tiff -level 102,0.85,200 output.tiff\n\nbut all I get is a blank image.\nAny ideas?? Are there other ways around?\n\nA: The .tiff format is not well supported in ImageMagick according to the support documentation for the program so it is unlikely to work as expected, try any other supported image format and you should be able to achieve the results you want.\n\nThe TIFF format is the propriety format for PhotoShop.  However it is\n  so   bloated with features, and has been modified by just about every\n  application   that has cared to use it, that no program, not even\n  photoshop can handle ALL   its variations.  Photoshop however has the\n  best chance at reading it.\nI would steer clear of the TIFF image file format unless you are\n  specifically working with photoshop, or the application accepts no\n  other,   better defined, image file format.\nI don't use the TIFF image file format, or Photoshop. If you use\n  this format   with IM extensively, perhaps you would like to submit\n  your findings to me,   to include here.  That way you  can help your\n  fellow TIFF users.\nWhether a specific software package can read a TIFF, all you can do\n  is try   it and see.  That is the problem with this format.\n\n", "Q: Executing .bat file I have a setup.bat file which install some applications and i want to execute it.\nThis is content of .bat file :\n@echo off\ncls\nRip_7z.exe x Rip0.7z\ncls\ndel Rip0.7z\ncls\nRip_7z.exe x Rip1.7z\ncls\ndel Rip1.7z\n\nI think the Rip_7z.exe file extracts the Rip0.7z and Rip1.7z files and builds the app. \nHow can I do this in the Ubuntu 11.04 Terminal?\n\nA: You have to run it through cmd eg.:\nwine cmd /c setup.bat\n\nA: You can run DOS batch file through wineconsole:\n$ cat ~/.wine/drive_c/file.bat\n@echo off\necho Working\npause\n$ wineconsole 'C:\\file.bat'\n\nYou get a new windows similar to this\n\nAlso, you can enter an interactive DOS prompt with\nwineconsole cmd\n\nYou will get:\n\n\nA: Firstly, Wine won't touch batch files.\nWhy do you have to do it in a terminal?

When I add a PPA via Software Sources it normally would show up in the Ubuntu Software Center shortly after. But lately it seems that any PPA I add either won't show up, or takes days to. Does anyone know what could be wrong?\n\nA: If this is the same bug that's been around for as long as I can remember then you need to run sudo update-apt-xapian-index -f to get the Software Center to update your added repo's. On further research, there are bug reports for this issue not showing added repo's and also for continuing to display repo's that have been removed. Either way, running this code will work for both. As of 13.04 this issue still persists.\n\nA: This issue can be partially resolved by installing something from the PPA via terminal first.

I'd like to keep with 11.04 if possible until 11.10 is officially released.\n\nA: It might have something to do with the (nearly) fixed power regressions in the linux kernel. I'd suggest (for laptops that is) to go back to 10.04 or go to 11.10 --> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/  if you are spunky enough to try an alpha.

Since I don't use GNOME now and try wmii, the nm-applet is no longer available for me.I know there is nmcli for the control. What I'm really interested in is that can it really be a substitute for nm-applet.\nman nmcli, there are these words, which makes me confused:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is not meant as a replacement of nm-applet or other similar clients. \nWhat does other similar clients mean?\n\n*The use case comprise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Servers, headless machines:No GUI is available; then nmcli is used to talk directly to NetworkManager and control only system-wide connections.\n\n*User sessions: For this case, nmcli can talk to nm-applet to find user connections.It can still talk directly to NetworkManager for manipulating these connections.  As nmcli doesn't have direct access to user configuration data in GConf, nm-applet handles that itself.  That may, for example, cause the applet to pop up keyring dialogs when secrets are needed.\nAs nmcli can work directly without X, Why can't it work as well when secrets are needed?\nPS. Is there any alternate easy approach to control connections using command line?\n\nA: First of all let me say that nm-applet can be used in environments other than Gnome: I used it successfully in awesome and in openbox.\nnmcli do not provide the same functionalities of nm-applet, e.g. you cannot configure new connections.\nA valid alternative to connect to wired or wireless networks from command line is wicd-curses.\n\nA: similar clients mean applications that do similar things as nm-applet, but isn't nm-applet. Since Network Manager is driven by DBus, anyone is free to write clients to control it without interacting with Network Managers code in any way. It's sort of like how you can connect to a web server with different browsers without changing the server.\nHeadless servers doesn't need secrets the same way a laptop does.\nI don't think the manpage says you can't use secrets. It says that if you have nm-applet installed, then it can be reused to provide per-user network configurations and personal passwords. If it isn't available, then I assume you would have to provide the secrets yourself.\nI don't normally use Network Manager from the command line. But it uses DBus, so it would be relatively easy to write a curses-application for it, or something. Or you could just use dbus-end manually, but that might not be pleasant. \n\nA: You can use the command line to configure a connection. For example, this command will create a vpn connection:\nnmcli con add type vpn ifname '*' vpn-type libreswan\n\nIf you need a secret then you can edit the config files for a vpn directly.  These are located at \n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/[connection name]. \n\nOpen the file in your favorite editor and add the lines \n[vpn-secrets]\npassword=[my password]\n\n\nIf you give a man a command he can use linux for the day, if you teach a man to man, he will be a professional\n\nA: Yes, you can use nmcli to connect instead of nm-applet. you can totally control your network connection using command line. \n", "Q: GUI for editing Menu in Xubuntu I see that Xubuntu has package Gnome-menus, but I cannot find the command to run the editor it should contain.

I've got just a few questions.\nFirst off, does anyone know of any good tutorials, guides, or other documentation for learning their way around the terminal? I know the basics, but any sort of in-depth guide would be absolutely lovely. I know that it is possible to install a GUI, but I'd just honestly enjoy working with and learning the terminal more anyway, and I'm certain I'll have to learn it at some point in my life.\nSecondly, do any of you have links to videos or (preferably) written guides on how I can set it up so that others may access and view the pages and files I upload?\nFINAL THOUGHT: I am running Ubuntu Server in a Virtual Machine as all the spare computers in my home have fallen victim to my screwdriver. Would this give me any issues? I am aware that desktops are generally not built for long periods of activity.\nFINAL THOUGHT PS: Thank you all so much for any assistance that you can provide. It is incredibly appreciated. (｡◕‿◕｡)\n\nA: The Ubuntu documentation can probably get you most of the way.\n1. Using the terminal\nThis is a very open-ended issue. Tutorials like UsingTheTerminal will tell you some of the basics but I'm really not sure how much you think you need to know.\nStart there. If you run into any more issues, try Google, the search on this site and failing that, post a new question explaining what you're trying to do.\n2. Hosting a website\nIf you're just hosting simple html files (no dynamic languages), the easiest document to read through is the server guide for Apache (a web server).\nIf you want MySQL and PHP too, the LAMP page might do you better. It still uses Apache, so don't be afraid to read both as you'll get a better understanding of Apache from the server guide.\nNeither of these explain the underlying networking that you'll need to do too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Port forwarding on the router to allow people to access your computer's port 80 from the internet.\n\n*The DNS (eg DynDNS) so you can bind a domain name to a dynamic IP your ISP gives you.\n\n\nIf you're just hosting things on a local network, you can ignore those items.\n3.

Speaking as somebody whose desktop has been in near-enough constant use for two years (down for upgrades, rewiring, etc), I can say, as long as it's a good desktop, it'll make a perfectly serviceable server.\nYou're right, in essence. Server grade hardware is built with long service terms in mind but modern consumer hardware is (and has been for the past 5-10 years) very acceptable. I say that with the bias of somebody who tends to buy premium components... I'm not sure what budget hardware is like these days.\nWhat is the VM host? If it's also Ubuntu, why not just install Apache on that, and forgo the virtualisation?\nVirtualised systems are slower. They take up a chunk of overhead too (not too much in Ubuntu Server's case, but still 100+ megabytes of ram that you might not have spare). However, serving static files from Apache is a trivial task. It uses a pathetically small amount of CPU time, so performance really shouldn't be an issue at all.\n\nA: One advantage of using a VM for the server, is that you can place the VM files for the server on other media as a backup incase any thing does happen to the desktop and you can get back up and running pretty quick.\nYou can always install a desktop, I have. Even tho I know a thing or two about the command line I enjoy a GUI. That said, if you use say a light desktop it won't add much to the over all resources.\nAmahi is a great home server solution, however its a bit tricky getting to it from outside your network. \nThere are many howto's on Howtoforge here http://www.howtoforge.com/installing-apache2-with-php5-and-mysql-support-on-ubuntu-11.04-lamp\nLastly you can find some really good terminal commands and examples here.. \nhttp://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse\nUse what ever you are like, command line or gui..

I wanna know that is there's a way, by which we can generate a unique hardware hash of particular machine? The hash should be unique to the machine and hash should be different even two machines are of same configuration. Is it possible?\n\nA: You could use the MAC address of eth0 (assuming this exists on each machine). You can get that on its own (there may be a simpler way) with this:\nifconfig eth0 | grep HWaddr | awk '{ print $NF}' | sed 's/://g'\n\nThat will give you something like 6cf04954aaaa.\nThese are supposed to be unique but they're not always. If all your network hardware comes from the same manufacturer, you might find some crossover, so be careful with it.\n\nFailing that, you could generate your own unique string and store it in /etc/computer-id (or another path of your choosing).\nuuidgen -r\n\nWill generate something as random as possible eg: 52a85807-35fe-409e-8983-87eb58c02ece\nuuidgen -t\n\nUses time and eth0's MAC to make something like: eb8280dc-b5ec-11e0-90dd-6cf04954aaaa\nBoth are fairly unique but, as with anything random, there is always the possibility of a clash. Keep a central list to avoid problems like this.\n\nA: The simplest solution I could think of is:\nsudo dmidecode -s system-uuid\n\nAccording to the manual page of dmidecode, this data is retrieved from the Desktop Management Interface which has something to do with the BIOS. It cannot be changed.\nI tested this command on two machines with the same hardware and the result is different as expected from the name system-uuid, so it can actually be used as unique hardware hash.\n", "Q: Where is Firefox's auto-fill information stored? I need to retrieve one text-box text on an Ubuntu installation I can't boot anymore (thank you Fedora!) on one specific website.\nWhere is the form information stored and how can I retrieve it?\n\nA: The form history is saved in a SQLite database file named formhistory.sqlite (replace $HOME by your Ubuntu home directory, and XXXXXXXX.default by your Firefox profile name):\n$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXX.default/formhistory.sqlite\n\nInstead of reinstalling add-ons, bookmarks, etc., you can just copy your Firefox settings to your new system.

I love the pipe to feed long text output into less (or more) to make it more readable. It's only on Ubuntu that i observed a uncommon behavior: Sometimes in less keystrokes are not processed immediately. It's like i have to \"confirm\" them with <ENTER>. For example less opens, text is displayed, i hit <SPACE> (nothing happens), i hit <ENTER> (page scrolls down now). This is very annoying, as it makes less practically unusable because the  also messes up the terminal output. \nIt doesn't happen for all piped commands. One example is:\nphp --rc PDO | less\nI've never seen this happen on any other Linux distribution.\n\nA: I've been battling with this problem all afternoon and, after finding this question and reading several manpages, had a bit of a brainwave. It turns out that redirecting STDIN to /dev/null acts as a workaround and returns \"normal\" functionality to less:\nphp --rc PDO < /dev/null | less\n\nor\ncat /dev/null | php --rc PDO | less\n\nIt is, of course, a horrible kludge of a workaround, and I don't have nearly enough knowledge of pipes and stream redirection in Bash to really understand what causes the problem or why this fixes it, but I figured that posting this was better than leaving this question entirely unanswered. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than myself will be able to shed some light on this - ideally with a more realistic fix.\nMy only guess is that php is receiving STDIN instead of less when you type commands into less, but I'm baffled as to why this behaviour is only seen in Ubuntu (I have confirmed that php --rc PDO | less works fine in Sabayon, CentOS and Debian, while breaking on several different Ubuntu installs, including those updated to 11.10).\nUpdating to include some relevant search results I've found.

I want to set up a user account on my laptop to access the network of my office, and in order to do that i need to install applications using my office ubuntu repos, is it possible to create a sources list file to use only by 1 user account, and the rest to use the common sources?\n\nA: You can have separated sources lists, but that only means than each repo you add will be defined in a sources.list file which makes more easy to purge a problematic repos. I did that using ubuntu-tweak (there's an option to store each repo in a separated file in the softwar origins tab). But I don't think you can have diferent sources for diferents accounts, since the sources are system-wide and not account specific.\nThink about it, that would mean you would have diferent versions of the same program installed in the same system which would be a potential disaster. If an user install libreoffice 3 from the ubuntu repos but another install libreoffice 3.4 from the libreoffice external repos, the 3.4 would \"smash\" the 3 installation... not to talk about the potential dependency hell you will cause...\nThe only way I can think for having a diferent account with diferent repos is making a diferent partition in your laptop but that's having two diferents ubuntu installs in the same computer. Then you can use your \"normal\" ubuntu at home and your \"workplace\" ubuntu with the office repos. You can make the install so they share the same /home/user so you'll have the same configuration files, the same user, but diferent programs.\nOther solution is to install a virtual ubuntu inside your normal ubuntu trough virtualbox, and link that virtual-ubuntu to your office repos. If your laptop is not much old it can handle a virtual os inside the main os without problems for normal office applications like office and such.\nWish it helps, good luck.\n\nA: I believe only one user account is able to install software from any apt repository: root. You don't have to login as root, of course. You normally use sudo to direct the root user to perform these actions on your behalf, but it's still being run as root. Since only the root user can install software, it wouldn't make much sense to provide a sources.list per user. But if you want to separate the office repos from the other ones, then you might add the deb-line(s) in a new file and place it in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. \nYour question wasn't easy to understand, though, so perhaps I misunderstood?\n", "Q: how to change sources.list directory The default directory of sources.list is /etc/apt and when we call apt-get update system store package information in /var/lib/apt and synaptic or package manager read information from there. suppose i have some packages already downloaded in hard disk. so if read package info (sources.list) from desktop and add package information in another directory then i can use synaptic or apt to safely install packages and then restore again sources.list directory.\nProcedure will be like this :\n\n\n*\n\n*Have packages in desktop with sources.list information of packages directory (anywhere)\n\n*change default directory to desktop\n\n*synaptic or apt will read from desktop and save information in another place\n\n*install packages\n\n*restore back previous directory information\n\n\nA: With a command line like the following\nsudo apt-get -o Dir::Etc=/path/to/other/dir update\n\n\nA: Why exactly do you want to do this? Often, it's also possible to download individual packages from a repository and install them separately, and if they are a lot of packages, you might not want to do it as it might break your system (the fact that you want to remove the sources again hints at this).\nWhat you might do for now is to first backup your sources.list file, then edit the file, install the packages, and then restore the backup.\nHowever, I would strongly advise you to use the Software Sources application to add additional repositories. Then, when you want to disable those sources, you can just uncheck them, without losing track of where you installed applications from.\n", "Q: Is there any record of group membership changes?

So (from a root recovery console) you could do something like\ngrep <your_username> /var/backups/group.bak\n\nto list all groups you used to be in.\nEDIT: as Lekensteyn rightly pointed out, it would be better to use the /etc/group- backup file, not the /var/backups/group.bak one.\n\nA: To recover you will need to boot from a live CD.\nMount the root partition (/). \ne.g. if your root partition is on /dev/sda1\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nThen edit the /etc/group file and add the admin group to yourself\ncd /mnt/etc/\nsudo nano group\n\nfind the admin group and add your user-id e.g. for me it would look like\nadmin:x:121:fossfreedom\nSave and Reboot.

I have set up ACPI wakeup so my laptop wakes up at a certain time each morning. The timezone for this is UTC. I want to set up my crontabs also using UTC so they fit with the wakeup alarm. \nHow do you do it?\nI've tried editing /etc/default/cron to include:\nTZ=\"UTC\"\n\nbut it doesn't work. (I've also tried TZ=UTC and TZ=\"UTC/GMT\")\nAny ideas?\n\nA: OK, I took some time and figured out how to do this on Ubuntu Natty, and here's how I made it work.  There may be a more elegant way, but this way works.\nFirst, we need wrap the cron executable in a shell that sets the TZ variable.  Here's how:\ncd /usr/sbin\nmv cron cron.real\n\nThen, create a new /usr/sbin/cron file.  I used vim, but you can use any editor you want, just make the file look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport TZ=UTC\n/usr/sbin/cron.real\n\nMake the new cron file executable:\nchmod ugo+rx cron\n\nNow, restart the cron daemon:\nservice cron restart\n\nYour cron jobs will now run on a UTC-based schedule -- HOWEVER, even though the time they are executed will be UTC, when they run they will have the timezone set to whatever is defined for the system.  To change that, put this in your crontab before any commands:\nTZ=UTC\n\nSo your crontab will look something like this:\n# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.\n# \n# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line\n# indicating with different fields when the task will be run\n# and what command to run for the task\n# \n# To define the time you can provide concrete values for\n# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),\n# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# \n# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system\n# daemon's notion of time and timezones.\n# \n# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through\n# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).\n# \n# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts\n# at 5 a.m every week with:\n# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/\n# \n# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)\n# \n# m h  dom mon dow   command\nTZ=UTC\n00 19 * * * date > /tmp/date.log\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem on Trusty (14.04). Solved it by setting machine's timezone then restarting cron service\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata - follow the instructions to select Region/Country\n\n*sudo service cron restart\n\n*timedatectl - Verify your date settings\n\n\nA: *\n\n*See /etc/default/cron. You can set TZ here for -all- crontabs and it should be TZ=UTC iirc. So your method should have worked.\n\n*Have a look at fcron. You can set individual crontabs at different time-zones:\ntimezone-name 'time zone of the system'\nRun the job in the given time zone. timezone-name is a string which is valid for the environment variable TZ: see the documentation of your system for more details. For instance, \"Europe/Paris\" is valid on a Linux system. This option handles daylight saving time changes correctly. The TZ environ,ment variable is set to the value of timezone when a job defining this option is run.\nPlease note that if you give an erroneous timezone-name argument, it will be SILENTLY ignored, and the job will run in the time zone of the system.\n\nA: Please see my next post for an Ubuntu-specific solution\nI know this is an Ubuntu forum, but I believe the answer will be very similar to how you would do this on a Red Hat system.  I do not have an Ubuntu system handy to test this on, but I did test it on Red Hat.\nAll you need to do is add a line to your cron daemon init script.  Set and export the environment variable TZ, like this:\nexport TZ=UTC\n\nThen restart your cron daemon.  Make sure you put this export in the cron daemon start script AFTER any other variable setting and sourcing -- I think this may be why the original poster's edit of the /etc/default/cron script did not work for him.  Maybe he set it, but it then got reset by something else further down in the script.\nNote that this will only affect the cron daemon itself, and not the jobs you run via cron, so if you want a cron job to use UTC as its timezone, you'll have to set it in the job itself, too.\nYou probably can not copy this verbatim and have it work on an Ubuntu box, but here's the init script I used to test this on Red Hat.  You'll find the export right before the start() function:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# crond          Start/Stop the cron clock daemon.\n#\n# chkconfig: 2345 90 60\n# description: cron is a standard UNIX program that runs user-specified \\\n#              programs at periodic scheduled times. vixie cron adds a \\\n#              number of features to the basic UNIX cron, including better \\\n#              security and more powerful configuration options.\n\n### BEGIN INIT INFO\n# Provides: crond crontab\n# Required-Start: $local_fs $syslog\n# Required-Stop: $local_fs $syslog\n# Default-Start:  2345\n# Default-Stop: 90\n# Short-Description: run cron daemon\n# Description: cron is a standard UNIX program that runs user-specified \n#              programs at periodic scheduled times. vixie cron adds a \n#              number of features to the basic UNIX cron, including better \n#              security and more powerful configuration options.\n### END INIT INFO\n\n[ -f /etc/sysconfig/crond ] || { \n    [ \"$1\" = \"status\" ] && exit 4 || exit 6 \n}\n\nRETVAL=0\nprog=\"crond\"\nexec=/usr/sbin/crond\nlockfile=/var/lock/subsys/crond\nconfig=/etc/sysconfig/crond\n\n# Source function library.\n. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions\n\n[ -e /etc/sysconfig/$prog ] && . /etc/sysconfig/$prog\n\nexport TZ=UTC\nstart() {\n    if [ $UID -ne 0 ] ; then\n        echo \"User has insufficient privilege.\"\n        exit 4\n    fi\n    [ -x $exec ] || exit 5\n    [ -f $config ] || exit 6\n    echo -n $\"Starting $prog: \"\n    daemon $prog $CRONDARGS\n    retval=$?\n    echo\n    [ $retval -eq 0 ] && touch $lockfile\n}\n\nstop() {\n    if [ $UID -ne 0 ] ; then\n        echo \"User has insufficient privilege.\"\n        exit 4\n    fi\n    echo -n $\"Stopping $prog: \"\n    if [ -n \"`pidfileofproc $exec`\" ]; then\n        killproc $exec\n        RETVAL=3\n    else\n        failure $\"Stopping $prog\"\n    fi\n    retval=$?\n    echo\n    [ $retval -eq 0 ] && rm -f $lockfile\n}\n\nrestart() {\n    stop\n    start\n}\n\nreload() {\n    echo -n $\"Reloading $prog: \"\n    if [ -n \"`pidfileofproc $exec`\" ]; then\n        killproc $exec -HUP\n    else\n        failure $\"Reloading $prog\"\n    fi\n    retval=$?\n    echo\n}\n\nforce_reload() {\n    # new configuration takes effect after restart\n    restart\n}\n\nrh_status() {\n    # run checks to determine if the service is running or use generic status\n    status -p /var/run/crond.pid $prog\n}\n\nrh_status_q() {\n    rh_status >/dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        rh_status_q && exit 0\n        $1\n        ;;\n    stop)\n        rh_status_q || exit 0\n        $1\n        ;;\n    restart)\n        $1\n        ;;\n    reload)\n        rh_status_q || exit 7\n        $1\n        ;;\n    force-reload)\n        force_reload\n        ;;\n    status)\n        rh_status\n        ;;\n    condrestart|try-restart)\n        rh_status_q || exit 0\n        restart\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo $\"Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|restart|condrestart|try-restart|reload|force-reload}\"\n        exit 2\nesac\nexit $?\n\n\nA: You can also use timedatectl to find and set the timezone. (Ubuntu 18)\ntimedatectl list-timezones\ntimedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles\nservice cron restart\n\n\nA: There is no easy way of achieving this. cron uses the local time. /etc/default/cron and other TZ specifications in the crontab just specify what TZ should be used for the processes started by cron, it doesn't impact the start time.\nMost solutions I have seen involve a utility in the middle, so cron would kick off something that would then determine when to kick of in UTC (e.g. if you know you are only concerned about DST changes, kick it off 2 hours before, calculate the time difference, and kick it off then. Have a look at at. To do so, people often use perl or python or similar scripting languages).\nThere is a nasty way to hack it if you wanted. cron only reads the TZ info off the system at startup. So if this is an ever running server, you could just set TZ to UTC, reboot, and after boot set it to your local timezone. You could script this as well.\nAs an alternative approach, also have a look at the @reboot syntax of cron, which should execute scripts after booting, which sounds like what you might want.\n\nA: There is a file that controls system timezone..\nI just got the same issue, here is the solution:\nIf you haven't configure manually any timezone, running date should display UTC time.\n\n\n*\n\n*create a backup\nsudo cp /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.bkp\n\n\n*remove the file:\nsudo rm /etc/localtime\n\n\n*I live in Chicago, (you may need to change the path, using tab key helps) so:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime\n\n\n*Then reboot.\nWhen your system startup perform:\ndate\n\n*now your timezone should be there now, and cron will look at this.\nFYI: setting the TZ variable is a temporary solution, and might act as a \"mask\" sometimes.\n\nA: As of March 2017, I discovered that crond supports the CRON_TZ variable in each crontab.\n\nThe CRON_TZ variable specifies the time zone specific for the cron table.  The user should enter a time according to the specified time zone into the table.  The time used for writing into a log file is taken from the local time zone, where the daemon is running.\n\n— quote from crontab(5) manual page\nThis allowed me to specify the time to execute each cronjob in local time, that automatically accounted for DST, while the server remained in UTC.\nNote, this was in the CentOS 7 distro with cronie 1.4.\n\nA: Add\nTZ=\"Europe/Warsaw\"\nbut not in etc!:\nRun cron service editor\nsystemctl edit cron.service\n\nand then, after you add and save, as above, run\nservice cron restart\n\n\nA: Just figured this out on Ubuntu 14/16.

At the top of the script get the UTC hour from the date command.

I executed sudo dhclient wlan0 again, but still no error message or network connection.\nLater today, I tried to connect to a public wireless network. Still got the same error. But when I reboot my machine, no such problems.\nI am confused by the wired situations. Is there anything wrong with my network configuration? What should I do if I encounter similar problems in future? \n\nA: May I suggest that you run the command\ncat /etc/network/interfaces\n\nThis will show the contents of the interfaces file. It should read\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nIf there is anything else in this file then edit it out by this command\ngksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nThis will open the interfaces file in gedit with sudo permissions. So you can edit the file and save it. I had to do this once when I somehow got wlan0:avahi as the wireless connection and I could not remove it any other way. You may need to re-start and then Network manager will do its stuff.\nRegards.\n\nA: Usually when you are getting such an avahi interface either your router or your own network card is not ready (or even has a problem) for some reason.\nIn my case I solve this quickly with either:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0\nor\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\nps: this question is related.\n", "Q: How to remove startup program/service which starts during booting?

Random example of the lay-out of bum:\n\n\nA: From the man page for apt-get use \nsudo apt-get --purge remove package \nto also delete the configuration files associated with that package.\nYou can also take a look in System->Preferences->Startup Applications.\nOn the other hand, you can always know what processes are currently running on your machine using System->Administration->System Monitor, clicking on the Processes tab. If you find a process which name is related to EC2, then you can locate the binary (remember to sudo updatedb before using it).

Click \"create\" and that should be it. You can now connect to the wireless network from other computers and the wired connection should be shared with the wireless network you just created. :)\n", "Q: VLC for flash video Is it possible to play all flash videos using VLC? Because flash is consuming a lot of processing power. In addition, with VLC I will be able to record every stream for example Ustream etc.\nI am using Ubuntu 11.04. \n\nA: VLC can play any Flash video for which you have the .flv file. It can also record anything it is playing.\nHowever, you can't always just point it at a webpage and play Flash videos on that page and it can't 'play' .swf files (because they aren't videos). You need to somehow download the .flv file. There are tools that work for some sites such as cclive , get_iplayer  and youtube-dl  that download the .flv files.\nNot all sites are supported by such tools but there is a work around that allows you to download the video file so that you can watch it without using Flash for the actual watching although you do need the Flash plugin installed to do this. This workaround uses Chromium  but a similar method works with Firefox+Firebug. \nIn Chromium, press Ctrl+Shift+J to open the developer console and click on the 'Network' tab. \n\nThen, navigate to the page with the video on and start to play it. You can then look for the item in the list with a type starting with 'video/' and click on it. \n\nThis will give you a URL which you can copy and download using wget or a download manager.\n\nOnce you have copied the url, you can close the page which will stop Flash from running.\nThis works for any non-live Flash video as long as additional digital restrictions management methods (like RTMP used on BBC iPlayer) are not used.\nLive Flash streams such as Ustream are, as far as I know, not possible to play with VLC. However, some sites may give you a proper streaming URL like an mms or rtsp link which VLC can play.\n\nA: As stated in another answer, VLC will play the URL stream behind an embedded video.\nI prefer the solutions that involve the use of Firefox addons that normally direct an URL to a download manager or to another browser but that can be set to select VLC instead. When there is a link that can be clicked and that goes directly to the video stream, like in Youtube, I prefer something like the Openwith addon (see below). But sometimes there is no such link.\nTo find that URL, the other answer provides a solution, which appears along others as answers to a similar question here.\n(The selected answer there is by no means the best. The most voted one, which is similar to the one under here already mentioned, is good because it involves using just the Chrome browser. But it does not work with all streams, and neither does the Firebug addon for Firefox, as far as I can tell.)\nMaybe the more convenient solution is using VLC along the Firefox FlashGot addon\nhere\n\n\n*\n\n*add VLC to Flashgot list: FlashGot options, General tab, Add, give a name 'VLC' , - then go to the VLC executable and select it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*FlashGot options, FlashGot tab, choose VLC\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*playing the video in Firefox, a Flashgot button should appear (add that to the toolbar or the status bar). Right-click the button, Available formats, and left-click the video. VLC should  start playing the video stream.\n\n\n\nVLC + the Video DownloadHelper\nthe addon for Firefox - that I mentioned in my answer there, just install the addon, play the stream,  the DownloadHelper button should start rolling, click the drop-down menu, then put the mouse over the title of the video, and then choose 'Copy URL'. (The download option is there of course, but that's another issue.)\n\nOpen VLC, Ctrl-N and then paste and open the URL.\nSome troubleshooting:\nTesting such links with VLC I notice that in some cases the player cannot play them or even crashes. But this can be fixed as follows:\nThe last part of such URLs is sometimes like /video.flv?start=0. Changing that to /video.flv? might make it work. (But in many cases the stream is played very well without this change. Also, in many cases the link may look completely different anyway.)\n\nTo start youtube videos (and alike: dailymotion, etc) in external players I think that the best solution is to use the Firefox Openwith addon and just add vlc instead of/beside browsers.\nAnd it works perfectly \n\n\nA: Get FlashVideoReplacer. The extension automatically replaces embedded flash videos with the original mp4 or flv videos, allowing to watch flash streaming content with a less CPU intensive plugin or standalone external player.\nKeep in mind that although VLC is an excellent player, the plugin isn't. FVR won't work well with VLC plugin. The recommended plugin is gecko-mediaplayer.

I tried the USB way, tried turning the HDD back to IDE from AHCI, but no hope. I don't want to install inside windows because I want to be able to access Windows files from ubuntu. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: There's probably a small error in the partition table - if that is the case all seems to work but the partition editor refuses to touch it. \nI'd suggest you remove the new partition using the original program (hopefully there won't be any more errors), then firing up Ubuntu LiveCD and using GParted to make the new partition.\n\nA: This is caused by partition table corruption.

When I mount files via cryptkeeper and truecrypt they show up on the desktop of admin account but also guest and family accounts.\nHow can I stop mounted files and hard drives to appear and being accessed from family and guest accounts?\n\nA: You'll need to use UNIX-style permissions to restrict what accounts can read the file.  If you go to the folders in Nautilus, right click, select Properties, and go to the Permissions tab.  Remove any permissions other than Owner and click \"Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files\".  Then only the owner (should be you, if you mounted the filesystems) can read the files.\n", "Q: Is there a way to control speed internet access to wireless connections? I connect to the internet on my pc via ethernet and wireless with a laptop. I want to control the speed of laptop wireless connection so when both are running I still have enough speed on pc to work and who ever us using wireless connection has less speed.\nIs this possible?.\nI mean to control speed up/down for pc and for laptop. With wondershaper I can only control up/down speed general I need to set different speeds for both computers.\n\nA: This can control Upload and Download Speeds: sudo apt-get install wondershaper && wondershaper --help \n\nA: If your two machines connect to the Internet directly (the device at the other end of your ethernet wire and the one that the WiFi from your laptop connects to), then the only way you can create this imbalance is at that point where the two paths meet. \nThis means, you either configure your 'router' device or the WiFi access-point to limit laptop bandwidth. But, the real trick is in being able to give the laptop full bandwidth when the PC is not taking any. \nIf you want to bias towards your PC, one way is to make the PC route your laptop's access to Internet. This requires you the keep that PC between the Internet and the WiFi access-point. That is provided, you can really do such a physical placement. \nIf that can be done, you would just throttle the WiFi access-point bandwidth from your PC when you are using Internet from there. And, at other times, leave the throttle open. Again, a downside to this is, your PC would remain up when laptop wants to reach Internet -- unless, you do more trickery. \nExpected present wiring, \n\nPC == Internet-Device == WiFi Access Point == Laptop\n\nSuggested wiring,\n\nInternet-Device == PC == WiFi Access Point == Laptop\n\nI refer to the Internet-Device as 'router' in the above description.\nAnd, expect that it is physically different from your Wifi Access Point (WAP).\nIf that is not the case, you need to figure out if-and-how the combined Internet-Device can be configured to throttle the WiFi bandwidth.\n", "Q: Disk Usage Analyzer reports that the .ecryptfs file is taking up as much space as the home drive I selected \"encrypt home partition\"\n when I set up my netbook with Ubuntu.  The disk usage analyzer now reports that twice as much space is taken up than actually is used. I have seen this question asked a few times, but the response typically tends to be along the lines of \".ecrypts/.Private are your actual home drive, and is encrypted, and the one that shows up as the home drive is virtual, it's not actually taking up hard drive space,\" which perfectly identifies the problem but is not helpful in fixing it.  \nNow, regardless of whether the hard drive is actually full, the system is treating it as full.  I keep getting warnings that I have 10MB of space left; I can't update my dropbox folder; I can't move files around efficiently; the machine seems unhappy, etc.  Is the only way to fix this to do the risky decryption procedure that involves permanently removing the home folder from the machine and possibly not being able to decrypt the backup?  Or is there some way to fix the disk usage analyzer so that it doesn't count the virtual home folder along with the private folder? I would prefer to keep my data encrypted.\nThanks!\n\nA: If your home disk is encrypted analyses from root file system will be incorrect as it displays /home/.ecryptfs\nBut if you choose /home/<user>/ It will display the correct information\n\nA: This is a bug in the disk analyzer utility.  It is misrepresenting the amount of storage that's actually being used on your disk.\nThe files that are actually written to disk (if you're using Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory) are located in /home/.ecryptfs.  The files and directories you see in your $HOME are actually a virtual representation of your encrypted data.  It's a phantom view of your decrypted data that the Linux kernel presents to the rest of the operating system.  Rest assured that it's not taking up twice the disk space.\nFull disclosure: I am the author of Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory feature and one of the current maintainers of eCryptfs.\n\nA: First,  it is probably important to understand that disk usage analyzer is not a control system that sets limits on how much disk space is available within your hard disk itself. It is simply a tool that provides a view into your system. Thus, this tool does not really force limits on your disk.\nSecond, what is really needed is to try to determine what is the actual capacity of the drive, what is actually filling the drive space, what partitions exist, and how these are being utilised. \nFor simplicity sake, let's just try a very simple disk layout of the following on our fake netbook:\nDisk total size: 16 GB SSD Hard Drive\n/boot - 250 MB\nswap 2 GB \n/     5 GB\n/home everything else\n\nSo, we don't have a lot there really and we decide to choose .ecryptfs for the /home partition as stated. That means we have about 8.5 GB for the /home partition and if disk usage analyzer reports that as twice the amount available - that is 17 GB - which is more than the space available on the SSD Drive.\nEven in this scenario though, Disk Usage Analyzer will not prevent the use of the disk, or impact its usage in any way. What is more likely to do so are large numbers of temporary files or other files taking up space within the system or another partition being completely filled and normal operations being impacted in that manner.\nHave you checked that all other partitions are not filled and that the /home partition itself is not nearing capacity itself?\nWould advise checking that first as it can prove beneficial to locating the actual issue which is preventing the problem. You may want to check for a hidden directory taking up space (maybe you are saving more data to disk than you may know).\nHope that helps. Have a nice day.\n", "Q: SSL not working on eth0 All secure connections like https, ssh are not working when I connect through eth0.

When I do ssh I get an error \"Connection refused by remote computer\".\nOther normal connections work however.\nRegarding firewall, there is no rule, I just see all as accept.\nThe wireless connection, which goes through same gateway works fine though.\n\nA: From a networking side it could be related to the default gateway being bound to the wireless interface.\nWe would need to see the output for the following to confirm:\nifconfig\n\nand\nroute -n \n\nThe other possible reason is from an application layer.  These services may not be configured to listen on an IP associated with that interface.  The following command will show you what is listening and on what IP.\nnetstat -an | less\n\n\nA: Who's/What network is eth0 connected to? It could be that someone in control of one of the routers/machines your eth0 traffic goes through could be refusing to carry traffic that uses an encrypted protocol. If they are doing that, it is quite likely that they are hoping you will switch to an insecure protocol so they can listen in, possibly to get passwords or spy on you or block certain things.\nMy advice: if Firefox/Chromium complains about certificate errors, do not accept any new certificates! It could be whoever is messing with your eth0 connection trying to trick you into a man-in-the-middle attack. (That means that you are tricked into having an encrypted connection to the attacker, who connects to the end website and forwards your requests. Of course, he can read the connection when he does this.)\nIf the network is one you pay for access to, have technical support help you if possible. If the network is one you pay for access to and the person you're paying is doing this, threaten to buy service from someone else unless they stop it.\n", "Q: Creating a dedicated grub partition before installing ubuntu I have suffered from boot configuration a lot. If windows is installed above ubuntu, ubuntu doesn't boot. if ubuntu is installed above windows then windows goes away. \nOf course, reinstalling grub fixes these things, but I suppose having a dedicated grub partition is going to help me a lot.\nSo I have fresh windows installed. I am about to install ubuntu 11.04. But before I install Ubuntu, I want to create a dedicated boot partition first. \nI thought creating a separate partition of about 200 mb and mounting it as /boot was called dedicated   partition but it seems it is not.\nHow to create a dedicated boot partition during ubuntu installation?\n\nA: Another option is to make a dedicated Grub2 partition (as opposed to dedicated /boot partition you mount at boot), see herman's tutorial.\nAdvantage: you can remove/install OSes at will.\nDisadvantage: you need to edit the grub.cfg file manually. To avoid having to do that after every kernel update I recommend using the link to kernel images, not the kernel image itself, for example use something like\nlinux   /vmlinuz root=UUID=3e4xxxxx-027b-407c-ba1a-xxxxxxxx ro   quiet splash\n\nnot\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-28-generic root=UUID=3e4xxxxx-027b-407c-ba1a-xxxxxxxx ro   quiet splash \n\nFor more info on using symbolic links instead of full paths for kernel images look here.\nDisadvantage2 (thanks psusi): when installing a new OS make sure you do not install its Grub image to MBR. Install it without Grub and then manually edit the grub.cfg file to include the new OS.\n\nA: Only if we need the master boot record of a harddrive for something else we may install Grub to a partition. Otherwise it is not a good idea to do so.\nDuring boot-up a boot manager such as Grub is expected on the boot device. That usually is the MBR of the hard drive (which is different to a partition), e.g. /sda (not /sda1).\nDuring installation Grub2 will recognize other operating systems on all drives attached and adds them to the boot menu choice (this can also later be done with sudo update-grub). The Windows boot manager does not do so - that is why we are unable to boot into Ubuntu when having installed Windows later.\nThere are several guides on how to partition your drives for dual booting, e.g. linked to in answers to this question (or more).\nFor recommendations on a separate /boot partition see this question.\n", "Q: How to disable keys from the keyboard?

My distribution upgrade from natty to ocelot has been running on and off for quite some time. The speeds at which it downloads is really slow, and I was wondering if there was a way to use the apt-fast command to perform a distribution upgrade to ocelot ?\nI looked into the source of do-release-upgrade but it uses the Upgrade module in python, and I could not find a reference to apt-get or wget which I could have replaced with apt-fast or axel. \nMaybe if I could just perform an update via do-release-upgrade and then run apt-fast upgrade when it asks me to press ENTER after updating the software sources ?

I had Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 working in prefect harmony on a dual boot system, where Win7 was the default OS. This was until I let Ubuntu upgrade itself to 11.04. Ever since that, the default OS is now Ubuntu. I entered Startup Manager from Ubuntu and changed the default to Win7, but still - effectively whenever I reboot Ubuntu starts up. When I enter Startup Manager again it seems as if Win7 is the default...\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If possible, edit the /etc/default/grub Grub2 configuration file manually and change the value at the GRUB_DEFAULT setting.\nFor details see the Ubuntu Grub2 help page.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu at my laptop (having windows 7 already - dual boot) \nI want to install Ubuntu (11.04) at my laptop wich already has windows 7.\nThe laptop has one HDD which came with 3 partitions.One hidden for the recovery(ASUS) the one as the partition for the OS(150GB) and the other as DATA.I've shrunk the latter and created unallocated space of about 25GB for Ubuntu.\nNow the step to follow is to boot into Ubuntu live cd that I have and after that install ubuntu.\nHow to properly select the unallocated space to install it(and be sure that I am selecting that and not any data)?\nWhen I should install grub? Which grub? (2/Legacy)? And how should I do that?\nThank you for your time!\n\nA: I actually did the same just yesterday on my brother's laptop (clevo machine with a 300GB HDD):\n\n\n*\n\n*I first installed Windows 7 on an NTFS partition with 170GB of space.\nI also created a second NTFS partition as a backup with 100GB of\nspace, leaving 30GB totally unconfigured/unpartitioned for Ubuntu (170GB C:\\, 100GB\nD:\\, 30GB # future Ubuntu partition #)\n\n*I booted up from the Ubuntu CD and when the installation proceeded to the\npartitioning/drive space allocation options, i was presented with the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I just selected the first option Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7.\n\n\nWhen the setup completed, i just rebooted and everything was ok.\nGrub installed, dual boot working just fine ;-)\n\nIf you want to change the default O/S when booting, you can do one of the following:\nThe \"hard\" way: \nFrom a shell, type:\ncat /boot/grub/grub.cfg | grep menuentry\nYou will get a list of all the entries in your grub menu.\nCount them starting by zero (0), e.g. \nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.38-10-generic' ....  <-- #0\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.38-10-generic (recovery mode)' .... <-- #1\nmenuentry 'Windows 7' .... <-- #2 \nThen, edit /etc/default/grub and change the entry GRUB_DEFAULT=X to the number you want (like #2 above for Windows).\nSave the file and do a sudo update-grub in order to update grub.cfg.\nYou're all set.\nThe \"easy\" way:\nInstall StartUpManager by typing:\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager \nThis application provides a GUI in order to make all the changes you need.\nMore information can be found here\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu is very simple. When you want to install it onto your HD, the installer will prompt you asking where you want to install it. I believe that you should choose the \"Manual\" option or something similar.  There, you should see your unallocated space, and you can change it to ext4 (the default filesystem for Ubuntu).  \nOnce you've formatted that partition, you can choose the new partition as your install base, and continue from there.  \nGrub will install by default just fine. No need to worry about configuring it.\n\nA: So everything went smoothly with the installation!\nThe only thing I want to change with grub is its default option. Its current is Ubuntu, but I want it to be Windows.\n\nA: Well, I haven't tried changing the default OS option because I was formatting and restoring windows installation with all my programmes,settings,etc.\nThe problem now is that due to the format procedure grub was deleted.\nWhat can I do to restore it?\nI am using the EasyBCD at windows..There is an option \"Add Entry\" and then selecting the Linux/BSD tab.\nThere are the types: \n1) GRUB (Legacy) \n2) GRUB 2 \nand some other which I am sure that are not what I want.\nAdditionally, it asks for the device:\n1)Partition 1 (100MB - System Reserved) \n2)Partition 2 (OS Partition made by me - windows are there) \n3)Partition 3 (Data is there)\n4)Partition 4 (Linux - 25GB)\n5)Partition 5 (Swap - 4GB)\nWhich one should I choose?\nThank you!\nEDIT:\nI managed to do it selecting the 2nd option (Grub 2).\nNow the only thing that troubles me is that at first there is the windows bootloader and if I select Linux grub is loaded.\nAnyway to have only grub as a bootloader?\n", "Q: How to hide text on titlebar? I want to change the height of title-bar, but until now (as I know) there's only one way to do that : change the font-size of WINDOWS TITLE FONT (in Appearance preferences). So far so good except the BIG SIZE of the text. How could I disable(or hide) the text?\n\nA: You'll have to edit the theme, if you installed them through the Gnome Appearance window the themes are here: home/[yourusername]/.themes/nameIchose/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml. And if you installed the themes through sudo apt-get, they're here: /usr/share/theme, you'll need to be root to make edits to the files there (use gksu nautilus).\nLook for something like this:\n<frame_style name=...\n    <piece position=\"titlebar\" ...\n<piece position=\"title\" draw_ops=\"title-...\"/>`\n\nIt depends on the theme. Experiment and you'll get results.\n", "Q: HD 6450 Radeon problems with installation I bought a Asus Pundit P6 with an iCore5 and a Radeon HD 6450. Starting Ubuntu 11.04 from a Live-USB-stick doesen't make any troube, but after installing 11.04 (64bit and 32bit, subquestion: what's better?) PC starts from HDD... Ubuntu-logo shows flickering .. intro-music plays but the Logo doesn't go away.\nWhat to do (remember I'm no Linux-pro!)?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my HP p7-1080t, same proc, same card.  Had to install the AMD Radeon Linux driver And that solved my problem. [ubuntu 11.04 64-bit]\n\nA: You are asking two questions :\n\n\n*\n\n*For the first one should I install Ubuntu 32 or 64bit?\nThis depends on your processor. 32 and 64 correspond to the size of information that the processor deals with. So if your processor can deal with 64bit strings it should be faster using Ubuntu 64bit version.\nTo check the type of processor you have; type uname -m in a terminal. If the output is x86_64 use 64bit version, if not use the 32bit one. (you can do this from the live CD)\n\n*Installing AMD's proprietary driver should fix your booting problem.\nAs you don't have a graphical mode where you can do it we will have to do through the command line.\nTo get to the command line try typing ctrl alt F1 once the computer seems to have booted. (If this doesn't work try to get to the command line through the recovery mode (One of the boot options)).\nOnce you are in terminal login, then type sudo apt-get install module-assistant build-essential fakeroot dh-make debconf bzip2 wget\nNow you need to download the driver :wget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-11-7-x86.x86_64.run\nOnce the file finished downloading type chmod +x ati-driver-installer-11-7-x86.x86_64.run && sudo ./ati-driver-installer-11-7-x86.x86_64.run\nEnter your password and follow the instructions to install the driver.\nFinally type sudo aticonfig --initial -f to configure the driver.\nReboot (sudo reboot)and everything should be mended.\nPs. I haven't tried everything I just wrote, I have already successfully installed AMD's driver from a terminal, hope it will work for you, good luck.\n", "Q: How do I add another distribution to grub2?

I have two actually. I had to replace the main one (originally I had 1980x1200 resolution) with one with 1980x1080. I fixed the resolution in the xorg.conf with the nvidia settings tool. \nHowever unity/gnome doesn't seem to notice the resolution has changed?\nNow my unity sidebar is only partially visible on the screen. How can I move it so it is fully visible again? I have not found any settings for that? \nUpdate: Also on the login screen, the bar that would allow me to choose a non-unity classic session is not visible.\n\nA: This sounds like a hardware issue - but some preliminary checks should be made:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double check the maximum resolution of the monitor via the box it came in/manual\n\n*Check if using Nvidia graphics that both nvidia-settings and /etc/xorg.conf resolutions agree with the resolution you were expecting.\n\n*Any other graphics cards, have a look at the \"Monitor\" window - both the monitor should be recognised and the correct resolution displayed.\n\n*Double check cabling from the PC to the monitor - could be loose/faulty\n\n\nOnce you are satisfied with these checks - have a look at the Monitor itself.\nMost monitors have a button(s) that you can change the position of the screen vertically and horizontally as well as the width and height.\nFor sharpness issues - look for a setting that says \"Auto\" or \"Fine\".\n", "Q: Suspend and hibernate don't work on a hp pavilion dv6 I just installed kubuntu 11.04 on my laptop which a hp pavilion dv6, and suspend/hibernate don't seem to work.

I frequently need to login from my desktop into my laptop using FreeNX, I am able to redirect the audio from session running on the laptop by setting the pulse audio default server using the \"padevchooser\" applet, setting it to the IP of my desktop.\nIs there an easy way to achieve this from the freenx session login ? For example overriding the PA default server from the .bash_profile?\n\nA: Exporting the current pulseaudio server to a X-session root window can be done with\npax11publish -e -S <pa-server>\n\nThis will export the currently used source, sink, and configuration of <server-pa> to the X11-session window.\nSwitching back to default is done by\npax11publish -e -r\n\nWe have however no experience and can not test how FreeNX does this and if that command is applicable.\n\nA: It was easier than I expected, looking into the source code from padevchooser I found that the server can be set from an environment variable, PULSE_SERVER, the following code on my ~/.bash_profile did it:\nif [ -n \"$NXSESSIONID\" ]; then\n  export PULSE_SERVER=\"local_desktop_ip\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: How can I install Linux Kernel 3.0 in 11.04? Recently Linus Torvalds announced the launch of next generation of the Linux Kernel: Linux 3.0. However, I have no idea how to update to this kernel version.\n\nA: I would like to echo @CYREX comment - you are already beyond the standard Natty configuration with the unstable Gnome 3 PPA.  Adding v3 of the Kernel might make your system unusable.\nTo try a newer kernel download the following .deb files from the v3.0-oneiric mainline tree.\n\n\n*\n\n*headers_i386.deb or headers.amd64.deb depending if you are using 32bit or 64bit\n\n*headers_all.deb\n\n*image_i386.deb or image_amd64.deb depending if you are using 32bit or 64bit\n\n\nInstall via\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote the following from the kernel wiki - \n\nEach mainline build is named by the base upstream version suffixed with an Ubuntu release name. This tells us the upstream version which was built, and additionally which configuration was used to build it. This tells us which release is most compatible with the kernel as built. This does not prevent the kernel being used on other releases, though it is most likely to work correctly on the release it is build for, or earlier ones. The further away from your base kernel release you are the more likely that there will be an incompatible userspace interaction which will prevent them working for you\n\n\nA: There are a number of changes to underlying systems like the boot process which have changed with Oneric, and simply upgrading the kernel on Natty does not work smoothly for me on my Natty machine. You need the module-init-tools - see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/amd64/module-init-tools/3.13-1ubuntu1 and possibly new versions of other tools (see http://awhitcroft.blogspot.com/2011/06/oh-no-30.html) I'd say it's best to stay with an earlier kernel for now in Natty.

Of course I can restart apache2 by /etc/init.d/apache2\n\nA: The commands start, stop, restart, etc., are links for initctl, and only work for upstart jobs.\nCalling directly the script in /etc/init.d/ will give a warning for upstart jobs, for which the use of the script is allowed for convenience, through a wrapper symlinked common script.\nCalling the service command always works, both for upstart jobs and for traditional sysv init scripts, so it is the preferred way.\n\nA: You should be able to use service:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n", "Q: How to split a large mp3 into the different tracks (also in mp3) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I split a mp3 file? \n\nI've got this huge mp3 file of the recording of a concert and I want to split each music into it's track so that when I burn into a cd audio it can have each track with a different song.

So it really should be left to the package maintainer's discretion. If the GTK+ 3 version is deemed stable enough, then it would probably be a good idea to enable it. As far as I know, the goal is to have all applications in the default install ported to GTK+ 3 in time for the 12.04 LTS release.

Any windows. Just doing it from Ubuntu. How can this be done. The update the mention is for the firmware and new programs for the phone. I do not know much about Blackberries since am more of an android guy. At the end they want support for upgrade/update the Blackberry from within Linux and sync it to the PC (Backups, upload/download stuff to and from it).\nI have seen 2 types of projects working on this:\nLinberry (From Venezuela ;) ) - http://linberry.webcindario.com/\nBarry - http://www.netdirect.ca/software/packages/barry\nbut so far neither offers updating the firmware or downloading updates. Are there any Ubuntu blackberry projects I am not aware of.\n\nA: Firmware updates cannot be applied to BlackBerry devices from Ubuntu, so the answer to your first question is 'No, it cannot be done'.  \nRIM, makers of the BlackBerry, have decided to support Windows and Mac only.  They also just lost $125 million in three months, a CTO, and a co-CEO, so maybe they are looking for new ideas. Try a feature request via their contact page.\nSometimes updates can be applied to mobile handsets at the wireless carriers' stores.  \nThe answer to the second part of your question is also 'No'.

Am I able to use gnome version 3?\n\nA: You are using Ubuntu Classic (Gnome 2). This is standard as is the message that your hardware does not support Unity. This message is misleading. Your hardware is powerful enough for Unity when you have the proprietary driver installed. The message should say that you will need to activate the proprietary driver to use Unity.\nThe intention is to replace proprietary drivers with an open source driver. When that project is finished, then that message will mean what it says. Until then .....\nInstall the proprietary driver using the Additional Drivers utility: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I activate Unity?\nYou will get a message saying driver activated but not in use. Ignore this message. It is also faulty. The driver is in use.\nRe-start and at login click on your user name and select Ubuntu from the menu on the bottom panel. That will run the Unity GUI.\nGnome 3 will be in 11.10. It is already in the Alpha versions. I am testing it. So, I know.\n\nA: In order to use gnome 3 you will have to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the gnatty ubuntu remaster (search ubuntu forums for it) - stable enough for me but, since it is only supported by one man is probably not the safest choice.\n\n*use the not-even-in-beta-yet development version of 11.10 which is surprisingly stable for a development release but is still not ready yet - obviously - to be used if you don't want to spend time fixing it.\n\n*wait for October and the official release of 11.10 (or at least September when it will be stable enough), which is probably the best idea.\n\n*use the gnome-shell testing ppa if you don't care about unity. This one isn't stable yet either.\n\n\nAs for the error you get above, I got the same one today\nI don't know which one of these fixed it, but I did both of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall unity and nvidia-current\n\n*Force unity to start by changing the file at /etc/environment (gksudo gedit /etc/environment) by adding this\"UNITY_FORCE_START=1 at its end\n\n\nA: If you want to, you can install the package named 'unity-2d' from the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and switch to the Unity 2D desktop?\nIt aims to provide the same features as Unity, but without the need for graphics acceleration. \nOr you can wait until October and upgrade to 11.10 which quite possibly will enable you to use normal Unity, but also comes with Unity 2D as fallback by default. Of course, you might benefit from testing development versions of it and reporting bugs. \n", "Q: How can I join together multiple VOB files? When I ripped a DVD using dvd::rip, the main title was split into several 1GB VOB files. How can I join them to make a single VOB file that contains the whole title?\n\nA: The size of a .VOB container file is, by definition of the DVD specification, limited to 1 GByte (1048 MB). \nIf we need a file that contains a whole movie, then we need to convert these files to  another container (e.g. xvid, MKV, plain MPEG etc.), e.g. by using ffmpeg:\n\nffmpeg -i snatch_1.vob -f avi -vcodec mpeg4 -b 800k -g 300 -bf 2 -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k snatch.avi\n(from manpage)\n\nConcatenating video files can only be done with some formats (e.g. MPEG).\n\nA: Go to the video_ts folder with terminal.\nFor example /Videos/DVD/VIDEO_TS\ncat VTS_01_1.VOB VTS_01_2.VOB VTS_01_3.VOB > ../Your_Joined_File.VOB\nYour joined file is on folder /Videos/DVD\n", "Q: What is recommeded file system for a grub partition? What might be the recommendation file system for a grub partition, so that it will be accessed from most of linux or windows or osx systems.\n\nA: I'd stick to the defaults, an ext* filesystem. Personally I use ext2 because the journaling function of ext3/ext4 can make mounting the filesystem slower (observed on a flash memory stick). AFAIK journaling can be disabled for ext4, but since I was happy with ext2 I did not consider ext4 for read-only partitions like /boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacFUSE seems to work for accessing ext2/3 partitions (read+write)\n\n*Windows supports ext2 (and ext3 without journal) with the driver from http://www.fs-driver.org/ (see also The best choice of linux file system and software that can be accesed from Windows)\n\n\nAvoid filesystems that do not support Linux file permissions like NTFS and FAT*. Although all files are owned by root and most of them have permissions 644, lack of proper permissions support could set inappropriate default permissions for the files.\n", "Q: chown: changing ownership of `...': Operation not permitted I'm trying to install Wordpress using the following installations.

For more info, and how to get that capability, see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man7/capabilities.7.html  Unfortunately it doesn't yet seem to be possible for a process to gain specific capabilities like this based on attributes of an executable file.   Either the process would have to be configured this way by another privileged process, or the executable would have to be fully setuid, and then give itself the capability before dropping root priviliges as a normal safety precaution.\nA tip of the hat to Can't change owner (user or group) of directory which I have all rights on? - Super User\n", "Q: What's different between gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3 and gstreamer0.10-fluendo-plugins-mp3-partner?

The Fluendo Plugins are a set of plugins for\nGStreamer which implement support for various media formats and hardware.\nThese plugins give you an opportunity to quickly and easily add proprietary\nsupport to their GStreamer-based products.\n\nThis package contains an enhanced mp3 codec.\n\n\n*\n\n*gstreamer0.10-fluendo-plugins-mp3-partner replaces gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3. Most likely the last one will someday disappear or be replaced by the 1st one.\n\n*gstreamer0.10-fluendo-plugins-mp3-partner contains an enhanced mp3 codec. \n\n\nA: From what I could gather, the new -partner lib doesn't depend on liboil, which is GPL (or LGPL). The non suffixed lib does depend on that. Liboil is a library to handle optimizations (like using MMX, SSE or the like when it can).\nNot depending on a (L)GPL library allows Fluendo to distribute their library more easily.\nIt is explained in better detail here: http://www.fluendo.com/shop/product/fluendo-mp3-decoder/\nI quote:\n\"The fully licensed binary GStreamer plug-in\nFluendo has paid the license of Fraunhofer and Thomson to be able to distribute a binary MP3 decoder. This means that people who want MP3 support for the desktop music players can get a fully licensed plug-in directly from this site.\n\"\n\"Issues to be aware of\nIf you are living in a country where the MP3 patents don't apply, you are entitled to use the source code provided by Fluendo (or anyone else) to get legal MP3 support onto your Unix/GNU/Linux desktop.\nIn contrast, if you live in a country where patents do apply, or if you are a distribution maker working in countries where the patents apply, you need the licensed binary from Fluendo. If this is the case, please be aware that, even if our binary is made from MIT licensed source code, the resulting binary, combined with our license, is not free software, at least not GPL-compatible. This means that if you ship GStreamer with our binary MP3 plug-in, you need to be sure that you don't ship any GPL-licensed plug-ins that could end up being used together with the MP3 plug-in, as this would be a violation of the GPL. You also need to make sure you don't ship any GPL-licensed players which would use this plug-in.\n\"\n", "Q: What will be the future of Unity 2d? Does anybody know something about the future of Unity 2D?

Is this possible ?\nThanks in advance!!  \n\nA: I assume that you want each minimized window to get an own icon in the panel.\nAs far as my experience goes (and I greatly agree that this is a definite usability lack) unity itself is not capable of it. However another dock I used previously (avant-window-navigator) will do this for you and even display the pdf-preview images for each icon.\nWhenever I have such a task to do, I launch awn additionally. It also features auto-hiding and workspace seperation, so you can have all the open PDFs on one workspace.\nAnother feasible workaround for the specific instance would be to have tabs in the pdf-viewer, but until evince supports this (already requested), you would have to use a different viewer.\n\nA: They actually do get minimized one by one. The launcher just hides it. I have an idea for you. \n\n\n*\n\n*1) Do all your PDF work on one workspace. \n\n*2) Add a bottom gnome-panel with a window switcher. (The same one as we've used by default in earlier Ubuntus)\n\n*3) If possible, make the panel only appear on your pdf workspace, or just make a keyboard shortcut so you can show and hide it quickly. \n\n\nFor a good result, you should delete the default upper panel. You can do this using gconf-editor, or you can just log out, choose Ubuntu Classic session, delete the upper panel and log back into Ubuntu with Unity. You then make gnome-panel start with the session (you can do that in the startup applications dialog)\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu One store my Information? I would like to get 20gb on Ubuntu One, but I am not at ease with the idea of storing my account information for the purpose of automatic renewal.

How can I do the same under Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can browse through the virtual /proc/kcore file (the image of the RAM) and look for a string you typed.

The package manager keeps records about the files it installed. If the files are no longer there, or changed, then the package manager might refuse to continue working. Another problem might be when the package manager tries to upgrade the eclipse package, it might overwrite your files.\nI suggest you install your own eclipse to /opt, or ~/opt, or any other directory not maintained by the package manager. You can then place a symlink in ~/bin pointing to your-eclipse-dir/eclipse.\nExample:\n$ mkdir -p ~/opt\n$ cd ~/opt\n# download or copy the eclipse tarball here\n$ tar xzf eclipse-something.tar.gz\n$ cd eclipse\n$ ./eclipse # verify that eclipse works\n$ cd ~/bin\n$ ln -s ~/opt/eclipse/eclipse\n\nNow you can start eclipse by typing eclipse. The symlink in ~/bin should shadow the eclipse executable /usr/bin/eclipse. If not, make sure that ~/bin is in $PATH and located before /usr/bin.\nYou can check which eclipse you are executing by using which:\n$ which eclipse\n/home/lesmana/bin/eclipse\n\n", "Q: music sound quality is bad under heavy cpu load My music sound quality is bad under heavy cpu load.\nDoes somebody has the same problem or knows how i can solve this problem?\n\nA: Icrease priority\nWe are able to increase the priority of the pulseaudio server (at the cost of other applications) by editing /etc/pulse/daemon.conf to values like e.g.:\nhigh-priority = yes\nrlimit-nice = 31      # maximum 31\nnice-level = -11      # -11 by default\n\nrealtime-scheduling = yes \nrlimit-rtprio = 9     # range from 1 to 99 \nrealtime-priority = 9 # default  5\n\nBe careful with a priority set too high as this may render your system unresponsive.\n\nChange sampling method\nIt may already be sufficient to change the resampling method of pulseaudio in the daemon.conf:\nresample-method = speex-float-1\n\nto a value that consumes less CPU power (e.g. src-sinc-medium-quality, or different values for speex-float).\n\nA: This problem is most likely caused by your computer doing too many things at once to release enough cpu time for the decoding of audio from mp3, ogg, flac etc. (although I have seen similar which I diagnosed as a disk caching issue once)\nIt can happen on a highly specced machine or a netbook - just depends on loading the CPU heavily.\nYou haven't included any details as to what CPU, memory, type of encoding etc you are using, so specifics are tricky, but:\nYour simplest plan - don't load the CPU so much when listening to audio\nAlternatively - you could try and renice the player process so it gets a bigger slice of the cpu pie\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu One perform when renaming folders?

To update it the official way, you need Windows and Samsung Kies (an application that does the updating). The unofficial way lets you do it with a Linux-native application called Heimdell. To start things off, you need to put the phone in \"download mode\" which involves restarting the phone, holding the home and volume-down buttons while turning it on. I'm fine up to that point.\nThe problem comes when plugging it into Ubuntu. I plug it in, Heimdell doesn't see anything and can't continue.\nAdditionally, lsusb stalls for a very long time and then fails to show the Samsung. If I unplug the phone lsusb works just fine. The phone seems to be the problem, for some reason.\nI've tried this with an Ubuntu laptop (on 64bit 2.6.38 - just as the desktop) and it registers fine. lsusb works as expected but Heimdall has some other issues.\nI want to get this working on my desktop because then I can let VirtualBox take the USB device and I can flash it with Odin (another tool from Samsung).

But the problem is during application switch (ALT + TAB). In that, Chrome's icon is the app icon. For example, when I launch Gmail as a chrome app, the icon is the gmail icon. But that icon is in low-resolution so it kinda makes the view ugly. What I want is I just want to change that icon, but don't know how to do it.\nSorry for my poor English.\nThanks.\n\nA: Chrome uses a site's favicon for it's application icon.

I have a large file (8GB for Example). How can I split it into multiple parts, let's say 3 equal parts, and after that how do I integrate them later?\n\nA: Using split -b with the appropriate number, you can get three pieces.\nNumber could be: \nsize=$(wc -c <\"file name\")\none_third=$((size/3+1))\n\nTo reassemble, use cat\ncat \"file name\"* > \"file name\"\n\nManual pages will help fill the details.\n\nA: There are several ways to accomplish this. Let's start with the basic ones.\nUsing the split and cat commands:\nLets says I have an image and its too big (10MB). All I do is:\nsplit --bytes=1M /path/to/image/image.jpg /path/to/image/prefixForNewImagePieces\n\nand then to put it together I use cat:\ncat prefixFiles* > newimage.jpg\n\nFor example:\nAssuming am inside the folder where the image is:\nsplit --bytes=1M myimage.jpg new\n\nif the image is inside a directory called images you can also do this:\nsplit --bytes=1M images/myimage.jpg new\n\nIf the image is inside the directory /home/cyrex/images you can do this:\nsplit --bytes=1M /home/cyrex/images/myimage.jpg new\n\n(In all the cases above it will split myimage.jpg in 1MB pieces and prefix the name of the pieces with the word new. So they would look like newaa, newab, newac, newad...)\nIf you are splitting a Text file and want to split it by lines you can do this:\nsplit -l 1000 book.txt new\n\nWhich will split the text file in output files of 1000 lines each. This is another way to split a file and is mostly used for text files like logs, sql dumps, csv files, etc..\nThen I merge them\ncat new* > newimage.jpg\n\nThis is one way. You can even change the size of the splitted pieces. Just change the part that says --bytes=1M to --bytes=1K for 1 kilobyte or 1G for giga, or another number like --bytes=4K for 4KB pieces.\nUsing Nautilus\nAnother way is the compress option in the gui of Nautilus. It gives you an option to split the file or files you want to compress into smaller megabyte sizes. Its simple and easy.\nYet another way is using 7z\nAssuming you have an ISO image called ubuntu.iso you could do this:\n7z a -v5m -mx0 ubuntu.7z ubuntu.iso\n\nThis will create 5MB size files from the ubuntu.iso. The -v5m is the volume size so you can change it to 10, 12, 1, 3 and also the m can be changed to k for kilobytes, etc; the -mx0 switch tells 7-Zip to use no compression, that is, just to split data into parts.\nTo extract just do\n7z x ubuntu.7z.001\n\nthis way you extract the first file and 7z starts extracting from the following files in order. You can also do\n7z e ubuntu.7z.001\n\nwhich has the same effect here.\n\nA: Gnome split? http://gnome-split.org/\n\nGNOME Split is a tool that allows you to split files and merge them back. It is written in Java and uses a GTK+ user interface (thanks to the java-gnome project). The goal is to offer a native implementation of similar projects which can handle multiple file formats (e.g. Xtremsplit).\n\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/08/split-large-files-easily-in-ubuntu-with-gnome-split/\n\nA: HOZ - Hacha Open Zource v1.65 - http://hoz.sourceforge.net/\n\nFrom the developer:\n\nOZ is what you would call a 'file splitter'. Its file format is the\n  same as the one used by the 'Hacha' software, a well known splitter in\n  Spain and  Latinamerica. HOZ is an open-source and portable  C\n  implementation of an 'Hacha' compatible splitter.\nHOZ is smaller and faster than 'Hacha'.\nbtw, I used a 'Z' isntead of a 'S' in 'Zource' because 'hoz' is\n  'sickle' in spanish, and since 'hacha' is the spanish word for\n  'axe'...\n\nAfter installing, you can use the Hoz GUI by dropping ghoz in a terminal. The operation is so simple that needs no explanation but further information can be reached in the developer's site.\nGood luck!\n\nA: WoodCutter\nA free file split and merge utility developed in Java.\nIt is a small size application that allows a user to split any type of file in smaller sizes in KB, MB or GB.\nIt is available for Linux as well as Windows.\nWoodCutter offers 3 ways of merging back the original files. WoodCutter creates a merge file which can be processed by the WoodCutter application to join all the files back. In case the receiver of split files does not have WoodCutter installed, then also the original file can be obtained as WoodCutter also creates a batch file and a Shell script file to merge the files back. The batch file will be used in Windows platform and Shell script will be used in Linux platforms.\nhttp://java-puzzle.blogspot.com/2009/07/woodcutter.html\n\nA: split --number\nThis is a good option to generate N files with the same size, except for the last one which might be larger due to indivisibility.

It is however more convenient many times, since you don't have to do the size calculation yourself.\nEqual number of lines was asked at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2016894/how-to-split-a-large-text-file-into-smaller-files-with-equal-number-of-lines\nTested in split 2.28, Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nA: Sorry to pull the thread in year end of 2022 but there is a simpler way.\n7z can be installed in wine and used to split for Fat32 compatible sizes or any other desired size.

We have more than 500 machines running Ubuntu. I have noticed that many machines have IP address conflicts. Is it possible to identify IP address conflicts in Ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*See the output here.\n\n*What does it mean actually? I get same MAC address for all the IP addresses?\n\n\nA: You can find them with arp-scan:\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan\n\nsudo arp-scan -I eth0 -l will show IP addresses, MAC address and manufacturer of the NIC and the line in the output that is a duplicate also identifies itself with a (DUP: 2) (where 2 is the second time this IP address is found for eth0.\nSome possible options to make the search more specific:\n\n\n*\n\n*Specify a list of IP addresses as arguments: sudo arp-scan -I eth0 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3\n\n*Specify network/bits: sudo arp-scan -I eth0 192.168.1.0/24\n\n*Specify network:netmask: sudo arp-scan -I eth0 192.168.1.0:255.255.255.0\n\n*Specify address range: sudo arp-scan -I eth0 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.27\n\n*Read a list of IP addresses from a file: sudo arp-scan -I eth0 --file=ip-address-list.txt\n\n*sudo arp-fingerprint -o \"--interface=eth0 --numeric\" 192.168.1.111 displays the IP address, the binary fingerprint string, and a list of known systems that match this fingerprint: 192.168.1.111     01000100000     Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6\nYou can add |grep {part.of.ip.address} to limit the output (do not use wildcards but regular expressions if you need more exotic combinations).\n\nA: In addition to arp-scan, the daemon ipwatchd may be useful in some circumstances and is worth mentioning on this question for others coming here via search.\n\nIPwatchD  is  a simple daemon that analyses all incoming ARP packets in order to detect IP conflicts.\n\nIt can be configured to run a user script when conflicts are detected too.\narp-scan is able to detect conflict across an entire network. ipwatchd detects when the hosts's IP address is use elsewhere as well.\nAs an aside, ARP is useful for this task as uses broadcast traffic which is sent to all hosts, whereas much other traffic is routed only to intended recipients (at the MAC level.)\n\nA: Okay, this is quite far off the Ubuntu topic, but based on your paste I'd say you need to have a look at your network config.  I know on the Cisco platform you can implement HSRP to have redundant layer 3 interfaces.  Should one switch fail for a particular vlan the other will become the standin.  Seeing the same mac for more than two IP addresses does look odd, but very well may be a symptom of your network's implementation and configuration--regardless of whether the config is correct or not.

Is there any reason for this? \n\nA: The 32-bit version of Ubuntu will run on most modern computers, but 64-bit has more specific requirements.  There are a few things that won't run well with the 64-bit version (although these don't seem to be many), so the 32-bit version is recommended just to cover all the bases, I think.  However, if you have a 64-bit computer, odds are that everything you need will run on it and will do so very well.\nFor example, I was able to get the Linksys AE1000 wireless access point to work just fine with my 32-bit Ubuntu, but when I changed to the 64-bit version I could no longer get the AE1000 to work.  (Perhaps there's a fix but I was never able to find it.)  However, that wasn't a big deal for me, and overall the 64-bit version feels a bit faster and it really runs everything else I've tried.\nAnd although the 64-bit version is called AMD, it works as well on Intel 64-bit processors.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio not starting Well here's an embarrassing problem.

I assume everything has fallen back to ALSA.\nFurthermore I've tried to start PA from the command line. pulseaudio -D just errors out with nothing useful, just E: main.c: Daemon startup failed.\npulseaudio on its own raises a little more:\n$ pulseaudio\nE: main.c: Unknown command: !/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF\nE: main.c: Failed to initialise daemon.\n\nI can start it as root with --system but nothing can connect to it. That's not the right way to run PA, so I'd rather fix it than bodge around it.\n\nA: Well that was the weirdest thing. I opened up /etc/pulse/default.pa and noticed that the first line was:\n!/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF\n\nThat looks an awful lot like a #!/bin/bash style opening (I don't know the proper name for it, comments on a postcard) so I stuck a hash at the beginning like so:\n#!/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF\n\nAnd it works!\nNo idea how that got broken. I don't think I've ever purposefully edited that file before.\n", "Q: Does the iwlwifi Wifi driver for intel cards support AP mode? Ok from my research so far, there is a driver that intel works on for its newer cards called iwlwifi. there's also iwlagn and I am unsure if they are the same? Anyway, do any of them support AP mode and the cfg80211 architecture?\nIt seems like the brcm80211 still does not support AP mode so i am looking at alternatives. Atheros is a good option so far :)!\n\nA: Have you looked at something called hostapd? It is in the Ubuntu Software Centre with a link to the developer's website. There you will see this comment:\n\nNote! Host AP driver was added into the main kernel tree in Linux v2.6.14. The version in the kernel tree should be used instead of this external hostap-driver package. The external releases are only for older kernel versions and all the future development will be in the main kernel tree.\n\nI have also found this link\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/MasterMode\nRegards.\n", "Q: Unknown artist / unknown album in Banshee & Rhythmbox for all music I've been trying to import the music from my CDs into Banshee but for some reason the music doesn't have any information about the artist, album etc e.g. the year is given as 1, the names of the tracks are all track 1, track 2 etc and the artist name is unknown artist. \nI have also tried it with Rhythmbox but have encountered the same problems. The strange thing is on previous installs of Ubuntu Banshee has worked very well at importing music from the same CDs I am now having problems with (i.e. all of them).\nI have a few elementary project PPAs installed; could this be messing it up? Or is it something else?\n\nA: Banshee (and probably Rhythmbox) automatically gets metadata for CDs from MusicBrainz.org.  Some recent changes with MusicBrainz broke CD metadata lookup in Banshee.  Since then, Banshee has been fixed to work with the new MusicBrainz API, but unfortunately, no stable releases have been made since the fixes were committed.\nYou can get these updates by switching to the daily builds of Banshee, but unless you're interested in testing pre-beta-quality software and reporting bugs, you probably want to stay away from daily builds.  The next stable version of Banshee will be released in September.\nFor more information, see this answer.\n", "Q: No suspend with Virtualbox 4.1.0 Since I upgraded to VirtualBox 4.1.0 on my 11.04 I'm having a problem of suspending.

I'm running Ubuntu from a \"Try Ubuntu\" file that I downloaded to my USB stick and booted from. Can I mount that very USB stick and write to it while running Ubuntu from it? If so, how?\nEdit to clarify: It's not important that settings of applications and such are saved; I'm just looking to save some specific data.\nAnother edit: I restarted and booted again. This time the USB stick is found (/dev/sdb1) but it is already mounted (read-only) to /cdrom, so I can't mount it again. A file called \"README.diskdefines\" on the USB stick says that it's Ubuntu 10.10 i386.\n\nA: I have tried to write to my cdrom drive but it requires root permission, which is not really practical as every time I need to write to the folder its mounted to, I have to use sudo/gksu.\nAfter some researching to make the cdrom folder writeable, I realized that the problem here is simple. Data need to be easily shared (both read and write) on both Windows and Ubuntu. So I have changed my approach and use following technique.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use GParted to have following partition layout on my 8GB USB stick:\n\n\n*\n\n*[ Primary 4GB fat32 label Data flag lba ] \n\n*[ Logical 710MB fat32 label LiveUSB flag boot/lba ]\n\n*[ Logical 3.29GB ext4 label casper-rw ] ]\n\n\nAfter I created all partitions, I had to unplug and re-plug the stick so that Ubuntu would remount all partition. I am not sure about the lba flag but I keep it just to be in safer side. \n\n*Use usb-creator to put Live USB to 2nd partition which is labeled LiveUSB. I also followed the instructions here and added the word persistent after append in order for the stick to become a real Live USB device.\nAfter booting from the newly created Live USB stick, a mount point Data show up, and I can write to that easily. After booting Windows and putting in the USB stick, I also have a drive labeled Data for me to write to. This fitted my need.\n\nA: Yes. If you want to, you can make your USB-stick persistent when you create it, which allows you to save settings and save files within Ubuntu. If you are looking to be able to access the files you write to the stick, while NOT running from the stick, you'll need to partition the stick. \nMore information on both can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent\n\nA: You can remount in read-write mode the partition mounted on /cdrom with the following command:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /cdrom\n\n\nA: Persistent partitions on syslinux type bootable flash drives do not work since 14.04, (SDC, UNetbootin, Universal).\nPersistent partitions do work on grub2 type bootable flash drives,(mkusb, grub-n-iso).\n", "Q: transcend usb not auto mounting I have a 16 gb transcend pen drive.

In case all USB drives fail to mount we may check if this is the case (and to enable or disable auto-mounting) by opening gconf-editor from a terminal and browse to apps/nautilus/preferences:\n\nDefault settings shown here\nFrom there the key media_automount needs to be ticked in order to allow mounting an USB drive when plugged in.\n\nRarely after a failed partitioning with Gparted we may encounter a problem with a persistent policy key that was set up (but not removed) to prevent mounting of drives while partitioning. Restarting Gparted should solve this issue.\n\nMounting USB drives independent of Nautilus can also be done with usbmount \n\nA: Usb must be FAT32 to work correctly .. So after what you did, you shoud formating a new partition table too to msdos.. After this you can create a FAT partition. \nPay attention, this procedure will erase all files on your drive.\n", "Q: Error while installing termkit Here is an error I'm receiving while installing termkit:\nnpm ERR!

Will there be a way to eliminate Gnome 3 in 11.10 and install Gnome 2 on that sytem?\n\nA: GNOME 2 will not be available in 11.10 as the entire stack (including GTK) has been upgraded to 3.x.\nThough a new project has been made to reintroduce GNOME 2 to newer OSs called 'Mate' (Pronounced mah-te) and it's available now as an official distro...\n\nA: GDM is easy enough. Install it, open a terminal and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm. This will enable you to choose between LightDM and GDM. \nAs for Gnome 2 you can't get that in 11.10. They are incompatible systems. You'll have to install an earlier version of Ubuntu. Gnome 2 is dead and will never come back. \nI would like to add, though, that a lot of people have the impression that the desktop that was used in the Gnome 2-based versions of Ubuntu, no longer is available. That impression is false. That desktop is called Gnome Panel, but unfortunately, the sessions have been renamed to things like Gnome Classic and Ubuntu Classic -- the new name is Gnome Fallback. It's the same software, except that you have to press and hold the alt-key when you right-click the panels to add applets, move applets, etc.  \n\nA: Gnome 3.0's fallback mode (which looks and feels like GNOME 2.x), continues to be useful as an accessible desktop, on thin clients, on operating systems, platforms, virtual desktop environments, enterprise deployments or wherever else high bandwidth GPU rendering is neither available nor desirable.  Some fat-client X86 focused distros such as Ubuntu may decide to drop it but I think the dependency of gnome-shell on clutter which depends on opengl which (for all practical purposes) depends on a local GPU-- will prevent this from being a \"one size fits all\" desktop as the previous GNOME and most other desktop operating systems are.\n\nA: Well, turns out Gnome2 won't be shipped in the next version as a \"classical\" option.\nAnyways, though I'm not a ubuntu hacker, it's almost certain someone will find a way of doing it. :)\n\nA: Just in case you don't really mean Gnome2, but Gnome Panel (the bars at the top and bottom that we've had in Ubuntu before) then yes: \n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.22.1.2-0ubuntu3 |         hardy | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.22.2-0ubuntu1.1 | hardy-updates | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.30.0-0ubuntu1 |         lucid | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.30.2-0ubuntu0.2 | lucid-updates | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.30.2-1ubuntu3 |      maverick | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.32.1-0ubuntu6.3 |         natty | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:2.32.1-0ubuntu6.5 | natty-updates | source, amd64, i386\n\n*gnome-panel | 1:3.0.2-0ubuntu6 |       oneiric | source, amd64, i386\n\n\nAs you can see, Oneiric (11.10) has Gnome Panel 3.0.2. :) You can use the application \"rmadison\" to find that information. It's in the devscripts package. \n\nA: Not to be a shill, but if you're looking for a simple GUI interface (including an application menu similar to that of GNOME 2), you might want to consider installing Cairo Dock (cairo-doc from the software center) in 11.10, and then at the LightDM login screen, log in using the \"Cairo-Dock (with Gnome and effects)\" option.  Have a look here for a discussion of some of the features of Cairo Dock:\nHow to remove session entries from LightDM?\nNote:  My preference is to use Cairo Dock in conjunction with the latest GNOME Shell (gnome-shell from the software center).  Some use it with Unity.  Some as a standalone.

Is there a way I get the amazing Deja-dup to make me hourly backups in addition to daily, weekly, biweekly etc? If not, is there something else that I could use instead?\n\nA: Wanted to follow up on user103965's comment.  This appears to be because when started from Cron, the process doesn't know about your dconf settings.  From this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10374520/gsettings-with-cron I was able to create a script that can be called from cron.\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nsessionfile=`find \"${HOME}/.dbus/session-bus/\" -type f`\nexport `grep \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\" \"${sessionfile}\" | sed '/^#/d'`\n/usr/bin/deja-dup --backup --auto\n\nmy crontab:\n*/15 * * * *  /home/useracct/bin/cronBackup\n\n\nA: Install Scheduled Tasks:\n\nAdd a job to it with the following parameters (replace every minute with every hour or the schedule you want to use):\n\nYou can even hide the pop-up window by using deja-dup --backup --auto as the command or use X-Application: suppress outup in the default behavior drop box, it will hide the window while deja-dup runs.\n\nA: Although it seems like the Déjà Dup code could not be easily modified to accomodate an hourly option, backups can be manually initiated and this can easily be added as a cron job that runs on the hour.\nHere are the steps you need to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the following two commands in a terminal to enable local access to the X server:\nxhost +local:\nxhost\n\n\n*Now run this command:\ncrontab -e\n\n\n*If asked to select an editor, go with /bin/nano.\n\n*Go to the bottom of the file and add the following line (followed by a blank line):\n15 * * * * env DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/deja-dup --backup\n\n\n*If you selected nano in step 2, press Ctrl+O followed by Enter and Ctrl+X. (If not, then use the appropriate commands for your editor to save the file and exit.)\nYou're done! Your backups will now take place 15 minutes after the start of each hour (12:15, 1:15, etc.)\n\nA: you can write a simple script such as \n    for i in `seq 1000`\n    do\n        deja-dup --backup\n        sleep 20  # define the frequency of backup here\n    done\n\nthen run the script in background. You can use infinite loop if you want.\n", "Q: Compress and split files in the file explorer If you right click a file in Nautilus and select Compress, then you get a dialog where you can choose a compression format and a filename. If you click on Advanced, then there are settings to split and compress the file, but it's deactivated/insensitive. How come and how do I activate those features?\nEdit: In an answer below, it has been suggested that it has something to do with rar. But I have that installed, and I don't get the options to split.\n\nA: To activate the split option, select .rar from the file extension drop-down box.\n\n\nA: Only some archiving tools support splitting. One of them is RAR -- package rar (but it's shareware and you need to buy it after 40 days -- Shareware in Ubuntu repositories? (RAR)) and another is for example 7zip -- package p7zip-full. You need to install one of them (I suggest 7zip because it's completely free).\nYou can also create a sigle archive and then split it into parts using split command (or HJSplit for GUI).\n\nA: Try replacing rar by unrar-free or the other wise around. \nThis can be done by simply\nsudo apt-get install rar unrar-free\n\n\nA: Considering the specific case of multi-segment ZIP files,\nthis is a complementary answer to the main one. \nAs already stated in the main answer, only some archiving tools support splitting, and the main GUI doesn't seem able to create multi-segment archives in zip format. Alternative formats can be used though, namely rar and 7z.\nAlso, only some tools can extract from multi-segment-zip-files, such as the ones discussed here: on that, see the end-note to this answer.\nAs the question specifically addresses the issue of handling archiving from the context menu of the file manager, I looked into some commands that could achieve the given purpose even for zip files: such commands, if successful, could then be easily added to the file manager as context menu entries.\nConsidering the zip tool, multi-segment archives can be created directly with a command like zip my_archive.zip -r <file> -s 20971519 (more details under this question), but these are not at all useful because they are not ready to be extracted (need a supplementary zip -s 0 command to create a large 1-file extractable archive - as described here) and this limitation cannot be avoided. Sending a such multi-segment archive to somebody that doesn't know this is pointless.\nAs already suggested in the main answer, another way is to zip the file and then split the one-file archive with split (or the hjsplit GUI). (I have tested the GUI and I found it extremely slow, while for the context-menu purpose the GUI is not needed.)\nThe idea is to add to the context menu of the file manager an entry that, with just one click, would \n\n\n*\n\n*compress selected files as a single zip file,\n\n*split the zip-file  in parts of specified maximum size, and\n\n*remove it in order to keep only the multi-file archive.\n\n\nSo, I have tested with Thunar and a custom action with these three commands connected by &&:\nzip -j my_archive.zip %F && split -b 20m my_archive.zip split.zip && rm my_archive.zip\n\n(That is to be applied to one or more selected files, but not to directories; to apply to directories, the zip -r option is needed:\n zip -r -j my_archive.zip %F && split -b 20m my_archive.zip split.zip && rm my_archive.zip\n\n)\n\n\n*\n\n*-j stands for an option for zip to \"junk the path\": unlike a terminal command containing the full path of the to-be-archived file(s) , a context menu command that uses %F for selected files would add to the archive a folder-in-folder structure unless -j is used; (source: create zip - ignore directory structure);\n\n*my_archive.zip is the custom name of the not-yet-split archive; the split command will be applied to it and then the former will be removed with rm\n\n*%F can be used in a Thunar custom action in order to compress multiple files as zip; alternatively, %f is to be used for selection of just one file;\n\n*-b 20m stands for the size of the separate archive parts created by split as indicated here;\n\n*split.zip is a specification that is not needed; it is the custom name of the final multi-file archive, it \nwould give something like split.zipaa, split.zipab, split.zipac..., and without it the output will be named x followed by the aa fragment-suffixes: xaa, xab, xac..., etc; there is a split option -d to use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic, but that gives an error (because apparently the extractor expects a standard ZIP multi-segment archive when it sees a numeric suffix - as suggested in a private chat by Stephen Kitt;\n\n*rm applied to the my_archive.zip file will only leave us with the desired multi-segment archive.\n\nNote:\nIn order for the resulting multi-zip-archive to be extracted, a tool that supports aa segmentetd archives is needed, like file-roller in Linux and 7-Zip in Windows. \n\nA: Using p7zip-full, as Vojtech Trefny suggested, works, but didn't enable me to choose rar as compression method. Neither did unrar. However, installing the package \"rar\" does present that option, and if you open Advanced, all options are sensitive.\n", "Q: How to change the login screen background from terminal? I am in the process of customizing a live cd. I have changed the default ubuntu wallpaper in live cd, however the same got reflected in login screen.

The initial password prompt was from sudo and was asking for your current password.  If you entered that in correctly, it would then run the passwd command.\nIf you want to change your own password from the command line, just run passwd by itself with no arguments and not via sudo.\n\nA: The cursor doesn't move because people aren't supposed to easily see how long the password is. It is being stored anyway. \n", "Q: Wine 1.3.25 update broke sound, how do I go back? Last Friday's Wine update to 1.3.25 broke sound, how do I go back to the previous version of Wine?\n\nA: There are instructions here, on WineHQ. You need to uninstall and reinstall an earlier version. According to the FAQ, this won't uninstall your apps.\nIt's more likely to be a problem with your configuration or a sound driver, though. You should open up the Wine configuration to be sure.\nIf the problem is not fixed when you use an older version of Wine, try 1) changing your sound driver to each individual sound driver and no other, then 2) removing your .wine directory and reinstalling your apps.\n\nA: Here you can get older versions of Wine for Ubuntu(in .deb format): http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/binary/\n\nA: I see Kevin already got his earlier version but others might come to get answers so I'll post what worked for me :)  This doesn't help you to revert to an earlier version of Wine, but it might enable sound in the current version.

As per the above display, using iproute 2009 version I am getting IPv4 class A address holding class C or B netamsk and vice-versa. is it a valid configuration ?\nQuestion2. As per the above display, if iproute allow to add multiple default routes, then what would be the behavior of packet flow when packet need to be routed using only one default route (where many default routes exist) ? also how the iproute filter multiple default routes ? also, is it a valid feature that iproute should allow multiple default routes in a server setup ?\n\nA: Classes, netmasks, and /## are all about grouping addresses into blocks. I don't like to use classes because the concept is outdated--they insist on putting the border (of what part of the address can change and still be in the block) where one of the dots is when that restriction no longer exists because of CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing). I prefer /## format over netmasks even though the dictate the same thing because with the /## format is easier when the border is not on the boundary. \nIn your list above, you have three blocks. (You call them class A, B, and C). You could represent them in slash notation like this: 127.0.0.1/1, 128.0.0.1/2, and 192.0.0.1/2. The number after the slash simply specifies how many of the bits at the start of the address have to be the same for the address to be in the specified block. Each chunk of numbers between the dots is worth 8 bits. If you want to put the bondary of what can change somewhere between the dots, you have to convert the number between the dots to binary first. As a side note, most of these addresses are already assigned to someone and using them on a private network behind NAT could cause problems. You should only need to deal with routes for addresses like these if you are running some backbone router. Also, some addresses like 127.0.0.1/8 are reserved for special purposes and using them will also result in problems.\nRoutes tell your computer what to do with traffic depending on its destination. A route that says, for example, 198.168.0.1/16 dev eth0 it means send all traffic that has a destination address that starts with 192.168 out the interface eth0.  If the route says 198.168.0.1/16 dev eth0 via 10.2.3.45 it means send all traffic that has a destination address that starts with 192.168 to 10.2.3.45 (hoping that 10.2.3.45 will know what to do with it. A default route is what the computer uses when it has no specific rule for the traffic. A default route will say what computer to send it to. Your computer will send all traffic it doesn't have a routing rule for to the address specified in hopes that computer will know what to do with it.\nYour questions don't make a lot of sense to me, but hopefully you might be able to figure it out if you understand it. I'll try to do my best to answer the questions, but some of them are a little confusing.\nI think the answer to question 1 is that it is valid because of CIDR. CIDR pretty much does away with classes.\nAs far as question 2 & default routes, my computer only picks one of them to use. If it isn't correct (the rule doesn't point to a valid router), the traffic is lost. If you want to balance connections, then you need to use bonding.\n", "Q: \"Cogs\" startup problem When I try to run the game Cogs from the command line, the game spits out the following error and dies immediately:\nCouldn't set 800x600 OpenGL video mode: Couldn't find matching GLX visual\n\nWhat does this mean, and how can I fix this?\nEdit: I have an intel graphics card.\n\nA: This seems to have been reported as being fixed in nvidia v280 if you are using a nvidia card.

I've been running Oneiric Alpha on a laptop, since the ati drivers in natty aren't new enough for the hardware. In general it's worked well; naturally there are the occasional crashes and bug reports. The strange thing is that--on occation--packages will uninstall themselves when I do an update. T\nhe first major one was unity. LightDM didn't have anything in the sessions menu, so I couldn't log in. I looked at .xinit files, searched all over, and finally figured out that unity had completely removed itself, even though it was the primary session type.\nOn another occasion, lightdm-greeter-gtk removed itself. Again, I had to hunt around in the logs to find that there was suddenly no greeter, although it had been working flawlessly for weeks before the update.\nI'm not asking for stability--I know it's an Alpha. I'm just curious as to why packages decide to leave.\n\nA: Depends on how you update. Doing partial upgrades offered by the Update Manager usually gets you into trouble like that.\nIMO the safest way is to update via command line (using apt-get) and paying attention to what's about to happen.\n\nI'm just curious as to why packages decide to leave.\n\nBasically because you updated when dependencies were not satisfiable. The system then decides what needs to be done (removed) to create a consistent state.\n", "Q: Can I make do-release-upgrade only download packages for a later upgrade? I'm running lubuntu 10.10, and would like to upgrade to 11.04. I have a very temperamental internet connection, so I would like to download all the packages before running the install.\nAccording to this, there is no easy way to do this. The bug report mentioned in that thread is still open.\nMy question:\nIs there a way to hack do-release-upgrade to only download the packages, kind of like adding a \"-d\" to apt-get dist-upgrade?\nOr is doing it manually the only way to get the result I desire?\nIf I have to do it manually, are these the steps needed to do it, or am I missing something?\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable 3rd party repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n\n*Change repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list from maverick to natty\n\n*run sudo apt-get update\n\n*run sudo apt-get -d dist-upgrade to only download the packages.

(Luckily, my upgrade today was almost complete...)\n\nA: Your first four steps are correct, but step 5 should be sudo do-release-upgrade (instead of sudo apt-get dist-upgrade).  It should notice that all (or most) of the packages it was going to download are already present in /var/cache/apt/archives.\nIn some earlier versions of do-release-upgrade there was a bug where it would clean /var/cache/apt/archives before downloading the packages anew, but IIRC that bug's been fixed.\n\nA: I wrote a script to do this, for my own upgrade of multiple machines to Ubuntu 14.04 \"trusty\".  It is called 'apt-get-other-release'.  Simple use:\n$ sudo apt-get-other-release -t trusty\n  [ a long time passes as it downloads stuff ]\n$ sudo apt-get-other-release -U\n  [ it prepares the system for upgrade -- this is quick ]\n$ sudo do-release-upgrade   # or update-manager, whatever you're comfortable with\n  [ upgrading also takes a long time and may still download some additional stuff ]\n\nThe script is at:\nftp://www.lubkin.com/pub/user/filbo/apt-get-other-release\nand version 1.0 has sha1sum: 87a466b2bb2d1ac5b0a08509246a450b8d1c7617\nBehind the scenes it's basically running apt-get update; apt-get -d dist-upgrade with its own private set of sources.list files.  Results are stored in /var/cache/apt-$to_rel/archives, and the '-U' flag copies those into system-wide /var/cache/apt/archives so that they will be present during your upgrade.\nYou could also copy the upgrade archive from one local host to another, saving bandwidth.  I did this for an amd64 and an i386 upgrade, copying only those *.deb which didn't have \"amd64\" in their names; then ran another apt-get-other-release -t trusty on the i386 machine, which downloaded another large pile of packages since the two machines had different stuff installed on them.\nFeedback appreciated; email cc appreciated, as I don't know when I will next look at askubuntu.

Simply use the GUI interface and make sure you hit the Cancel button when bandwidth is not good or fails.  The cancel button \"should\" do all the cleanup for you.  I did not follow the steps above and only used one interface and no terminal.  I resumed after 3 or 4 fails the following morning.  I was still able to upgrade the current version before the full dist upgrade.  Disclaimer: I was successful, you might not be.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I've never done this before. It might be a horrible idea. It might break everything, empty your bank accounts and flee to the south of Spain. As with anything potentially dangerous, make a backup before you do anything.\n\nI'm not sure how much stuff you have installed, so this might be a flawed solution but you can upgrade from CD. Download the Alternate iso, mount it, and run the upgrade script.\nwget -c http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso\n\nBefore I go any further, you don't have to use wget to get the image. Bittorrent will work well as with a standard download manager. The important thing is you want something that will resume, so you can stop downloading and pick it up at another time. This is what wget's -c flag will do.\nOnce you have the ISO, the next step is fairly simple:\nsudo mount -o loop ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso /media/cdrom\nsudo sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\n\nThe flaw that I talked about is this will only upgrade things integral to Ubuntu that are included on the CD. It won't upgrade your other packages.\nIn theory this should be fine. You might find that some applications break, some might be forcibly removed by the updater, but the core OS should remain stable.\nIf my theory is right, this will then let you upgrade your other packages using as and when you want to through Synaptic or (if you install it) aptitude.\n", "Q: stuck in the busy box i have been using windows xp and ubuntu natty using dual boot. it has run perfectly until one day when i tried to boot ubuntu i am getting the busy box shell. i dont know what that is  :( when i try to restart,\n\n\n*\n\n*the following options come up.\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu 11.04\n\n*ubuntu recovery\n\n*mem test\n\n*another mem test\n\n*win xp pro\nwhen i try to open win xp it opens perfectly..\n\nA: Busybox shell fallback occurs during the boot cycle when the root partition cannot be located, fails to mount, and/or the /sbin/init binary cannot be located on it.\nSometimes this is due to hardware failure, a loose connection, or other corruption.

A typo or mistake on this like will kick you out to busybox.\n1) Make sure the /boot/vmlinuz-$version line on that file is correct.\n2) Use the 'blkid' command to check the disk UUIDs. Make sure the UUID matches the drive you want to boot from.\n", "Q: How to recover a file which was removed in nautilus when running as root?

I was fooling around trying to fix this problem, and I removed some important packages. When I realized that it was cleaning out more things that I had intended, I just rebooted, rather than try to find the forked process and stop it. Now I can see in aptitude that I have several broken packages, which do NOT show up in synaptic. Rather than try to install the missing packages (e.g., Python, YIKES!), the \"resolution\" is to remove 354 packages that are still installed which depend on what's missing. Is there a command to go through all the installed packages, and make sure that all of their dependencies are also installed? If I could just get a list, that would be useful, but, clearly, a command to just \"do it\" and install them would be better.\n\nA: Other than the installation and/or apt-get -f install suggestions mentioned in comments, you can tell aptitude to find a different resolution by using the , and . keys to navigate through the list of available resolutions in the examine view (entered with e). Sometimes the first suggested resolution involves uninstalling packages, whereas the next few will involve upgrade/downgrade/re-install operations.\nIn addition, you can \"accept\" or \"reject\" proposals regarding individual packages by selecting them in the list at the top and using a or r keys respectively.

I installed the hard drive in an enclosure, and then installed Ubuntu 11.04 on it. Partitioning was pretty straight-forward, as long as you know what your doing.\nAs for performance, I have seen no major impact on performance. Yes, it is a little slower than what it would be on an internal SATA hard drive, but it's definitely usable. It's a much better alternative to dual-booting, especially if the computer is a family computer, and the other family members don't want to me to fool around with dual-booting and possibly messing up the Windows partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*My boot time is under 1 minute.

If I compile something and want to send the binary to a friend or post it on the internet, \ndo I need to use some special GCC arguments? Does GCC optimize the binary for my specific CPU and will it run on CPUs that are a bit different or on an other Linux distribution? What else do I need to know?\n\nA: Generally just need to know the binary format (mac, pc or unix in 32 or 64 bit) and if any special libraries or driver are needed. Most desktop machines run a 64bit pc format. There are some rare formats though. Gcc's default options without optimisation should be fine. There are cross compilers that enable you to compile win binaries on unix.\n\nA: It really depends on what is target system architecture.\nSo if you are trying to run binary on arm or ppc architectures you need to have cross compile toolchains for arm or ppc respectively. \nHowever if you are trying to run it on another computer (which generally use pentium architecture), you can probably get away with 32 bit compatible binary as 32 bit can easily be run on 64 bit machines moreover unless you are using some proprietary technology you would be able to make it cross platform compatible.\nGood luck. \n", "Q: I just moved my HD from a Lenovo X201 to a Lenovo W520, and everything seems to work.

I don't need to do a clean installation?\nIn other words, is Ubuntu generally installed on a hard drive in a way that make it portable across different Thinkpad models and configurations?\n\nA: Yes, this is the normal outcome.

It turns out my user can't play sounds, though I can play any sound if I'm logged as root (via sudo su). \nHow do I add sound playing priviledges to my user?\n\nA: Use a text editor as root and manually edit the /etc/group file. Look for the line that says audio and add your username to the end.\nThis is how the line looked before I edited it:\naudio:x:29:\n\nThis is how the line looked after I edited it:\naudio:x:29:username\n\nSave the file and logout, then log back in and test sound. If it doesn't work try rebooting just to make sure changes are applied and test audio again.\nDon't forget to celebrate!\nIf you still can't hear audio, make sure your Master Volume is not muted. Install alsa-utils which will install alsamixer so you can control your soundcard (volume, mute, boost, choose card, etc.) Run alsamixer in a terminal by typing alsamixer and use your arrow keys to raise the volumes.\nYou can't run alsamixer as a normal user until you add yourself to the audio group. Even if you run alsamixer as root and your system was on mute and you raise the volume to the max, you still will not hear any audio until you've successfully added yourself to the audio group. The key to getting sound in a minimal install is adding yourself to the audio group.\nNote: I never installed pulseaudio to my system. Don't know if that changes things. If it does: try purging pulseaudio from your system first, then install alsa-utils and follow the instructions I gave at the top to add yourself to the audio group.\nGoing off on a tangent: This is the first minimal install I do so I'm learning a hell of a lot about how ubuntu works. I'll tell you this: I have a deeper appreciation for distros with gui's & desktop environments and the people who make them. It's a hell of a lot work to build a friendly system with all the essential tools and programs. Just wrapping your mind around some of these concepts will keep you up for days. That being said I have a sneaking suspicion there's a lot of other groups you may have to add yourself to to get things to work in a minimal install. \nFor example, I haven't tested out google voice yet but I may have to add myself to the voice group. We'll see. By default a user is not automatically added to a lot of groups in the minimal install. Hey we wanted to start from scratch and make all the decisions right. Well... here we go. \nHappy building!\n\nA: Add your user to the audio and pulse-access groups\nCommand-line\nsudo adduser <username> <groupname>\n\nThen log out and back in or reboot.\nSource.\n\nA: Please try the command alsamixer as your designated user and determine that no output-channel is muted.\n\nA: This solution might work for you guys I remove every package that are associated with pulseaudio or pavucontrol by trying sudo apt remove *pulseaudio* and sudo apt remove *pavucontrol* then I reboot my pc and I install alsa-utils by typing sudo apt install alsa-utils and insted of pulseaudio I install kmix sudo apt install kmix and reboot and I open youtube and Audio is WORKING but kmix is a not good as pulseaudio so I reinstall pulseaudio and it's WORK!\n", "Q: How to cancel software upgrade When I turned my computer on today, I opened a terminal and ran sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get upgrade. But I read on OMG! Ubuntu that the latest version of Wine, 1.3.25, \"breaks audio playback for Windows apps\". I obviously didn't want to break sound in my games, so I decided I had to keep the old 1.3.24 version until the problem was fixed. I didn't know how to stop the software upgrade, so I just pressed Ctrl+Z while it was downloading the new version. What should I do now?\n\nA: If depend that you have de ppa of wine, if you dont have dont worry Ubuntu only upgrade the stable version of Wine. \nIn case that you have the ppa of wine, you have desactive in origen of software. \n", "Q: Automatically kill a process if it exceeds a given amount of RAM I work on large-scale datasets. When testing new software, a script will sometimes sneak up on me, quickly grab all available RAM, and render my desktop unusable.  I'd like a way to set a RAM limit for a process so that if it exceeds that amount, it will be killed automatically. A language-specific solution probably won't work, as I use all sorts of different tools (R, Perl, Python, Bash, etc).  \nSo is there some sort of process-monitor that will let me set a threshold amount of RAM and automatically kill a process if it uses more?\n\nA: Try the prlimit tool, from the util-linux package. It runs a program with resource limits. It uses the prlimit system call to set up the limits, which are then enforced purely by the kernel.\nYou can configure 16 limits, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*maximum amount of CPU time in seconds\n\n*maximum number of user processes\n\n*maximum resident set size (\"used memory\")\n\n*maximum size a process may lock into memory\n\n*size of virtual memory\n\n*maximum number of open files\n\n*maximum number of file locks\n\n*maximum number of pending signals\n\n*maximum bytes in POSIX message queues\n\n\nA: This was too big to fit a comment. I modified Amey's original script to include a pgrep, so instead of having to manually enter the process id, you can just exclude by name. For example, ./killIf.sh chrome 4000 kills any chrome process that exceeds 4GB in memory usage. \n#!/bin/sh\n\n# $1 is process name\n# $2 is memory limit in MB\n\nif [ $# -ne 2 ];\nthen\n    echo \"Invalid number of arguments\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nwhile true;\ndo\n    pgrep \"$1\" | while read -r procId;\n    do\n        SIZE=$(pmap $procId | grep total | grep -o \"[0-9]*\")\n        SIZE=${SIZE%%K*}\n        SIZEMB=$((SIZE/1024))\n        echo \"Process id = $procId Size = $SIZEMB MB\"\n        if [ $SIZEMB -gt $2 ]; then\n            printf \"SIZE has exceeded.\\nKilling the process......\"\n            kill -9 \"$procId\"\n            echo \"Killed the process\"\n            exit 0\n        else\n            echo \"SIZE has not yet exceeding\"\n        fi\n    done\n\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nBe careful to select a narrow grep string and a big enough memory limit to not unnecessarily kill unintended processes.\n\nA: I would strongly advise not to do it. As suggested by @chrisamiller , setting ulimit will limit the RAM available with process.\nBut still if you are insisting then follow this procedure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the following script as killif.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ $# -ne 2 ];\nthen\n    echo \"Invalid number of arguments\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nwhile true;\ndo\n    SIZE=$(pmap $1|grep total|grep -o \"[0-9]*\")\n    SIZE=${SIZE%%K*}\n    SIZEMB=$((SIZE/1024))\n    echo \"Process id =$1 Size = $SIZEMB MB\"\n    if [ $SIZEMB -gt $2 ]; then\n        printf \"SIZE has exceeded.\\nKilling the process......\"\n        kill -9 \"$1\"\n        echo \"Killed the process\"\n        exit 0\n    else\n        echo \"SIZE has not yet exceeding\"\n    fi\n\n    sleep 10\ndone\n\n\n*Now make it executable.\nchmod +x killif.sh\n\n\n*Now run this script on terminal. Replace PROCID with actual process id and SIZE with size in MB.\n./killif.sh PROCID SIZE\n\nFor example: \n./killif.sh 132451 100\n\nIf SIZE is 100 then process will be killed if its RAM usage goes up beyond 100 MB. \nCaution: You know what are you trying to do. Killing process is not a good idea. If that process has any shutdown or stop command then edit the script and replace kill -9 command with that shutdown command.\n\nA: I hate to be the guy who answers his own question, but this morning I found an alternative method, wrapped into a nice little utility. It'll limit CPU time or memory consumption:\nhttps://github.com/pshved/timeout\nI'm giving this one a shot first but upvotes to Amey Jah for the nice answer.

I upgraded the RAM of my laptop to 4 GB by using two RAM chips with the following specification:\nStorage Capacity: 2 GB\nMemory Type: DRAM\nTechnology: DDR2 SDRAM\nForm Factor: SO DIMM 200-pin\nMemory Speed: 800 MHz (PC2-6400)\nData Integrity Check: Non-ECC\nRAM Features: Unbuffered\nSupply Voltage: 1.8 V\nCompatible Slots: 1 x memory - SO DIMM 200-pin\n\nSince I upgraded my RAM, Ubuntu freezes every once in a while. When Ubuntu freezes, I shutdown down my laptop and reboot using the Ubuntu live CD to check for file sytem errors. Then, I run the fsck program, and it discovers and fixes some file systems errors. Then, I run the badblock program. But, badblocks does not find any problems. I believe the fact that badblocks does not report any problems shows that my hard disk is healthy. And, the filesystem errors seem to be due to the forced shutdowns.\nI'm using 64 bits Ubuntu 10.04 lucid with kernel 2.6.32-33-generic.\nHow can I troubleshoot this problem? How can I find out why my Ubuntu freezes? What log files should I consult? What should I look for in the log files to find the cause of freezes?\n\nA: Well, if you suspect the problems started after you installed the new memory, then I would test that memory. You can do that from a live-cd or memory stick. I don't remember if it's available in the boot menu of an installed system. RAM can be bad and bad RAM can cause your system to freeze. If you're using the proprietary driver from ATI, then that's caused freezes here from time to time. But it's difficult to tell what the reason is without more information. \n\nA: If you still have the ram, swap it back out to the old stuff. Test it for a time to see if it freezes. Memtest86 is a wonderful tool, I would recommend letting it run all night long, let it do 3 or more passes. \nAlso check the hard drive SMART information. \nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda\n\nYou can see an overall status with -h rather then -a. \nHere is my output. \nLines to take note to are, Raw_Read_Error_Rate,Reallocated_Sector_Ct, Seek_Error_Rate.

If that is the case, it should be fairly easy to fix this. Open a handy terminal and try this on the main Ubuntu:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --recheck\n\nAs for getting Android to work, you might be able to install it without a bootloader. Then boot into the main Ubuntu and run \nsudo update-grub\n\nand see if that finds it.\n\nA: I believe this is adaptable for use on any Ubuntu distribution to dual boot with Android X86 without having to use separate partitions for each OS. This works thanks to the ability to use the same ext4 journaling file system for both operating systems. It took me a couple days to compile this. If your Ubuntu or Android X86 distribution are different, simply remember to make the appropriate terminal command changes (Android X86 4.4 to 5.1 would look like; initrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img} to initrd /android-5.1-r1/initrd.img}). Check system for 64 bit support before downloading .ISO files. If your system does not support 64 bit, use 32 bit, or 86 bit.\n\nHow to install dual boot of Android 4.4 x86 r3 and Ubuntu (on the same partition)\n(Works with other revisions and versions of Android X86)\nThings you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Non-partitioned HDD (formatted)\n\n*(x2) USB flash drives 2GB or larger\n\n*Secondary PC to flash .ISO files to USB flash drives\n\n\nBegin by downloading Unetbootin, and .ISO files for both Android x86, and Ubuntu.\nFlash the .ISO files to each of the USB flash drives.\nEnter BIOS on PC with formatted HDD and enable booting from USB/CD.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Ubuntu .ISO and complete a full install.\nReboot PC with USB flash drive inserted containing Android x86 4.4 r3 and begin install following these exceptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When prompted, select HDD sda1 and DO NOT format or select another file system.\n\n*When prompted, DO NOT install GRUB, or EFI GRUB 2.\n\n*When prompted, select as read and write.\n\n\nRemove all media and boot the PC (it will automatically load Ubuntu).\nOpen the terminal and type:\nsudo -i\nnano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nUsing the arrow keys, navigate the the line below the last current entry in the custom boot loader menu and make the following four entries:\nmenuentry \"Android-x86\" {\nset root='(hd0,1)'\nlinux /android-4.4-r3/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=generic_x86 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/android-4.4-r3\ninitrd /android-4.4-r3/initrd.img}\n\nPress and hold ctrl, x, then press y, and then press Enter\nType:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nImmediately after BIOS loads, press and hold the Shift key until GRUB loads.\nSelect which operating system you wish to use.\n\nRECOMMENDED! Load Ubuntu first, and create a disk image (.ISO file) of your new dual boot set-up and flash it to another USB flash drive and store it as a backup. You can do this after you apply any updates, or install any programs you wish.\n\nThe result should be a dual booted Ubuntu and Android X86 utilizing the default Ubuntu GRUB2 boot loader menu with the benefits of; no separate partition for OS's, shared Linux swap space, same file system (ext4), space for installation of Android applications limited ONLY to the space remaining on your HDD (not a weak 2Gb-??Gb partition), and the ability to file browse between Ubuntu and Android X86. Essentially you have installed Android X86 within Ubuntu.\nnote: Unetbootin now has a self contained application downloadable and compatible with Windows.\n", "Q: How to swap X-Server with Emacs org-mode? I'm quite impressed of emacs' org-mode. So I want to use it for note-taking during lectures. To use it \"distraction-free\" my idea is the following:\nI want to register a bash-command, which swaps the x-server session with tty2 and starts emacs with its org-mode. Is it possible to pass my credentials from the x-server session to tty2 (optional)?\n\nA: By default tty2 is occupied by init for getty. You can probably change this by removing /etc/init/tty2.conf, but that was too adventurous for me and the instructions here are for tty9 instead (which is by default unallocated).\nFirst, put these commands to ${HOME}/bin/orgmode.sh or other file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nTTY=/dev/tty9\nUSER=pschmidt\n\n/usr/bin/sudo chown ${USER}.tty ${TTY}\n/usr/bin/sudo chmod 620 ${TTY}\n( /usr/bin/sudo -u ${USER} /usr/bin/emacs -t ${TTY} -nw ) &\n/usr/bin/sudo chvt 9\n\n(Use a different value for USER as necessary.)\nThen, execute this bash command (not sure what you meant by register):\nsudo time getty -n -l \"${HOME}/bin/orgmode.sh\" tty9 230400\n\nSome caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*The time command (or a similar dummy) is needed to prevent sudo terminal rearrangements from placing emacs on your current terminal\n\n*The speed value of 230400 is there only because getty requires it, other values probably work also\n\n*If sudo needs to ask your password and that messes up things, you can first run sudo echo and then the above command.\n\n", "Q: Can Kubuntu simulate the Aero Desktop Peek functionality from Windows 7 Windows 7 has an Aero feature that allows you to make all windows on a workspace transparent to let you look at desktop.  \n\nI already have a shortcut setup for \"show desktop\" but that doesn't do so without minimizing all of the windows running on a given workspace.\nIs there any way to make all windows completely transparent by moving the mouse to one corner of the screen?\nThe reason why I don't want to minimize any windows because WINE has a slight glitch when running PokerStars - WINE will completely freeze if you minimize a running table window w/ PokerStars.\n\nA: In my experience, the closest for this case it would be the \"Opacify\" function inside of the CompizConfig Settings Manager, which will allow you to define which key binding you wish to activate it. When in use, the \"opacify\" function will decrease the opacity level of the active window in order to allow you to \"see\" the items below it. This behavior is also observed in the windows placed in lower places.\nThe next screenshot illustrates the options that can be configured via CompizConfig Settings Manager Opacify function:\n\nThe next screenshot shows the \"opacify\" function in action.\n\nWhen the mouse arrow goes far from the window size, the \"opacify\" function starts to work.\nHowever, the behavior of the transparent windows can be handled via de Commands section and its respective bindings, as shown for the Aero Snap function shown in this answer: Is there any Window Manager like the Windows 7's for Ubuntu? but I haven't tried that yet. I hope you find a better solution because of the commands/bindings may become a hard work.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You could run \"PokerStars\" on a different workspace. Then when you need to access your desktop you could always switch to a different workspace where the desktop is accessible.\nIt's not an answer to your question, but maybe a solution. \n", "Q: How can I install applications on secondary storage hard drive?

That file begins with this:\n# Changes:  in most of the cases you should not modify this\n#           file, but provide customizations in jail.local file,\n#           or separate .conf files under jail.d/ directory\n\nUsing ssh as an example, note the definition of a non-default port as well =)\n[ssh]\nenabled = true\nbanaction = ufw-ssh\nport = 2992\nfilter = sshd\nlogpath = /var/log/auth.log\nmaxretry = 3\n\nYou then configure fail2ban to use ufw in (one .conf file for each service)\n/etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-ssh.conf\n\nThe syntax is\n[Definition]\nactionstart =\nactionstop =\nactioncheck =\nactionban = ufw insert 1 deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH\nactionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH\n\nNote: You configure fail2ban to use ufw and to insert new rules FIRST using the \"insert 1\" syntax. The delete will find the rule regardless of order.\nThere is a nice blog post that goes into more detail here\nhttp://blog.vigilcode.com/2011/05/ufw-with-fail2ban-quick-secure-setup-part-ii/\n[EDIT] For ubuntu 16.04+\nby default a \"defaults-debian.conf\" in /etc/fail2ban/jail.d with content \n[sshd]\nenabled = true\n\nwill activated a the ssh protection of fail2ban.\nYou need to put it at false.\nThen create a jail.local like you would do in general, mine would be like this:\n[ssh-with-ufw] \nenabled = true \nport = 22 \nfilter = sshd \naction = ufw[application=\"OpenSSH\", blocktype=reject] \nlogpath = /var/log/auth.log \nmaxretry = 3\n\nThere is already a ufw.conf in the fail2ban default installation so no need to create one. \nThe only specific change for you jail.local would be at action line where you need to put the application concerned for the protection and what you want to get as result. \nufw tend to detect automatically a certain amount of app running using the network. To have the list just type sudo ufw app list. It's case-sensitive.\n reload fail2ban and you'll no longer see the fail2ban chain and if any IP get a block you'll see it in sudo ufw status\n\nA: I have been using fail2ban and ufw for years on couple of different computers, and never had any problems. To setup fail2ban:\nsudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\nsudo nano jail.local\n\nNow edit the file as you wish, for example if you want to block unauthorized ssh find the lines:\n[ssh]\nenabled  = true\nport     = ssh\nfilter   = sshd\nlogpath  = /var/log/auth.log\nmaxretry = 6\n\nif \"enabled\" is set to \"false\", change it to \"true\" as noted here.\nAfter you set the rules you need to restart the fail2ban process:\nsudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart\n\nIf you've opened the port 22 on your ufw firewall fail2ban will ban the clients that try to connect more than 6 times without success, it will not break your firewall.\n", "Q: Application Menu for RubyMine I noticed that there are some applications (e.g., RubyMine) that are not integrated with the Global Menu.\nFor LibreOffice I've seen that there already are fixes. \nHow do you make an app like RubyMine integrate well with the Global Menu?\nIf there is no current solution, what do you have to do to fix this (and give it back to the community)?\n\nA: The problem is with Java Applications and Unity. \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/+bug/768966\nOne option is to follow this:\nHow do I enable or disable the global application menu?\n\nA: There is a java library that tries force global menu in Java Swing applications.

If there's any doubt, you can email your plans to Canonical and you'll get a straight answer in writing. Here's the relevant extract:\n\nCommunity advocacy. Ubuntu is built by, and largely for, its community. We share access to the Trademarks with the entire community for the purposes of discussion, development and advocacy. We recognise that most of the open source discussion and development areas are for non-commercial purposes and will allow the use of the trademarks in this context, provided:\n\n*\n\n*the Trademark is used in a manner consistent with the Usage Guidelines below\n\n*there is no commercial intent behind the use\n\n*what you are referring to is in fact Ubuntu. If someone is confused into thinking that what isn't Ubuntu is in fact Ubuntu, you are probably doing something wrong\n\n*there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Ubuntu or its related projects unless it actually has been approved by and is accountable to the Ubuntu Community Council\n\n\nTo keep people at Canonical happiest, you could adhere to the branding guidelines here:\n\n*\n\n*http://design.canonical.com/brand/B.%20Complete%20Ubuntu%20brand%20guide%20-%20November%202010.pdf\nThey are design guidelines so aren't legal-issue-aimed but you'll find out the way Canonical wants things branded.

Streamtuner includes support for some of the largest directories and listings of internet radio stations and live broadcasts such as SHOUTcast, Live365, Xiph and basic.ch. With the help of an additional software package called streamripper, you can record your streams or live broadcasts and save them to your hard drive so you can listen to them at a later time.

That happen also with me when I upgraded from Vista till win7 that it created it self new NTFS partitions and having problems with one logical partition where it used to be the ubuntu(thanks god not my /home) \nAfter you manage to do your backup you can try out this commands in a terminal (I'm assuming that your ubuntu is in sda5)\nmount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\ncp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\nchroot /mnt\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sda\n\nand reboot your computer and it should load the ubuntu, after that you have to add your windows over the grub2 menu list, to do it so type in one terminal\nsudo update-grub\n\nI hope that you can solve your problem and you dosent need to reinstall everything again (including win). If you have to do it so I recommend to make you partitions physical and not logical how the windows does. There is many ways to create it partitions before installing the OS's. I recommend to have one HirensBoot always in hand. In this cd you can find all the kinds of tools that you might need to partitioned your HD and many, many others cool things \n", "Q: How can I remove packages using preseed? I'm setting up an automated \"no questions asked\" preseed system and using Dustin Kirkland's server preseed as an example. \nHe uses the following line to install three packages as part of the automated install: \nd-i pkgsel/include string byobu vim openssh-server\nI am looking  for the inverse of this, basically be able to remove packages as part of the automated install.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've checked the Installation Guide\n\n*I've checked this example preseed, but it's not clear if this is the canonical list of every single option available.\n\n\nI am thinking I need to to use d-i preseed/late_command string apt-remove packagename to clean up stuff I don't want when the install is done, but I am not sure\n\nA: There isn't an option to purge o delete a package in the preseed configuration script but you can use this command....\nd-i preseed/late_command\nThis command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is\nstill a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it\ndirectly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install\npackages and run commands in the target system.\n\"in-target\" means: chroot /target\nd-i preseed/late_command string [in-target] foo\n\nexample :\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\n            in-target apt-get remove packagename\n\nyou can also run a script :\nd-i preseed/late_command string \\\n        in-target wget http://........./postinst.sh -O /root/postinst.sh; \\\n        in-target /bin/bash /root/postinst.sh\n\nor install a group of DEB files :\nd-i preseed/late_command               string \\\n    for deb in /hd-media/*.deb; do cp $deb /target/tmp; \\\n    chroot /target dpkg -i /tmp/$(basename $deb); done\n\n\nA: The example pressed is just an example; it does not contain all possible d-i combinations, but just those more common.\nPersonally, I have never tried to remove packages from an install, so I am not sure there is a specific d-i command for it; it sounds like your d-i preseed late_command should work. A quick search on the d-i docs did not produce anything... But, of course, Colin would know ;-)\nAlternatively, you could start from a basic server, and then add whatever you want:\ntasksel tasksel/first   multiselect     Basic Ubuntu server\n...\nd-i preseed/late_command string apt-install whatever else\n\n", "Q: How can I ctrl-alt-f# to get to a TTY in a QEMU session? I'm doing an install via testdrive using QEMU/KVM and I would like to check the log files during the installation, however I can't figure out a way to send Ctrl-Alt-F1 and other F keys to the virtualized window (It instead goes to the TTY on the host machine).\nCtrl-Alt-1 through 4 send me to some kind of QEMU consoles (the installer is on one, then there are qemu consoles and one serial and one parallel, so I think I'm getting close.\n\nA: You can try using sticky keys: Press the first key three times to \"stick\" it to the \"virtualized window\" followed by the other keys e.g. CTRL+CTRL+CTRL+ALT+F1. \nThis should send the command to the virtual machine instead of the host machine \"hijacking\" it.\n\nA: sendkey can be used to send keys to the virtual system that your host intercepts at low level - such as Ctrl + Alt + F*.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ctrl + Alt + 2 to switch to the QEMU console.\n\n*Type sendkey ctrl-alt-f1 and press Enter.\n\n*Use Ctrl + Alt + 1 to switch back to the virtual system, which should now by at TTY1.\n\n\nOnce at a virtual terminal, you should be able to use the chvt command, e.g. sudo chvt 7 to go back to your X session.\n\nA: You can change tty in the guest os running on qemu with ALT + left or right arrows on the keypad.\n", "Q: Xsensors shows only one temperature I have been trying to find out the temperatures on my Laptop since I feel it has been overheating. the processor seems fine but the HDD is definitely on the fritz. \nProblem is that the applet is only showing one temperature. I do not know how to increase the displays. Can anyone help out please?\n\nA: First, install lm-sensors . which contains a program for detecting sensors on your machine. Next, open a terminal and run:\nsudo sensors-detect\n\nFollow the instructions (usually, pressing Enter to accept the defaults is enough):\n# sensors-detect revision 5861 (2010-09-21 17:21:05 +0200)\n# System: CLEVO CO. B7130 (laptop)\n\nThis program will help you determine which kernel modules you need\nto load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe\nand recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,\nunless you know what you're doing.\n\nSome south bridges, CPUs or memory controllers contain embedded sensors.\nDo you want to scan for them? This is totally safe. (YES/no):\n\nAfter a few questions, you've to press Enter once again to get a summary:\n....\nNext adapter: DPDDC-C (i2c-14)\nDo you want to scan it? (YES/no/selectively): \n\nNow follows a summary of the probes I have just done.\nJust press ENTER to continue: \n\nOn the last question if you'd like to add modules to /etc/modules, type yes and press Enter:\nDriver `coretemp':\n  * Chip `Intel digital thermal sensor' (confidence: 9)\n\nTo load everything that is needed, add this to /etc/modules:\n#----cut here----\n# Chip drivers\ncoretemp\n#----cut here----\nIf you have some drivers built into your kernel, the list above will\ncontain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones!\n\nDo you want to add these lines automatically to /etc/modules? (yes/NO)\n\nAfter exiting sensors-detect, the modules are unloaded again and won't be loaded automatically until the next boot, so load the modules manually using sudo modprobe module-name. I had a module named coretemp, so I ran the next command to get extra sensors:\nsudo modprobe coretemp\n\nIf you restart xsensors, the new sensor will become available. Another command from the lm-sensors package is sensors which shows its output in the terminal. Example output of sensors:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:       +44.0°C  (crit = +105.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:      +41.0°C  (high = +95.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0001\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 2:      +39.0°C  (high = +95.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\n\n", "Q: is there a way to specify the \"UbuntuOne\" folder in windows?

Then after I close that popup or menu and switch to a different application or workspace there is still an echo, a grey area where the popup or menu was. The only way to get rid of it is either to reproduce the graphical effect and hope it goes away properly this time or to close the owner of said popup or menu(so if Chrome made a popup and it leaves an echo it will only go away after closing all instance of Google Chrome). \nDoes anyone have a solution? I tried Googling but it's hard to Google for this sort of thing(that or my Google-fu is lacking). \nI use Ubuntu 10.10 and Gnome 2.32.0.\nEdit 29-07:\nI included a screenshot. The effect is in the lower right corner.\n\n\nA: I have two guesses. First, it might be that Compiz (the program in charge of graphical effects) is not refreshing the area where the animation occurred after the last frame. I have this happen all the time on my Desktop. What I do to get rid of it is to move the cube slightly (most any graphical effect the uses the whole screen should work). \nTo test this, you could login using the classic Ubuntu interface, and then run metacity --replace. If it doesn't happen any more, this could be it.\nAnother thing it could be would be some drag and drop bug. In this case, you might not be able to click anything behind the grey area. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what you could do about that other than seeing if you can reproduce it and then reporting it.\n", "Q: Unity doesn't look right when running in Parallels I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 on my 2010 13' macbook pro using Parallels Desktop 6.

Does anyone have an idea on how to fix this?\n\nA: Unchecking \"Enable 3D acceleration\" in Video Hardware settings will give you a working Ubuntu again, but without OpenGL.\nThe reason is Unity, the new Desktop Environment for Ubuntu.

Also, you might want to check how to enable 3D graphics capabilities as Unity needs that as well.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Installing MySQL 5.1 this question is surely a dupe of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632056/how-do-you-install-mysql-5-1-on-ubuntu-8-10\nSince I can't comment on that one...I am starting a new one.

I'm trying to implement a configuration mechanism that allows in a certain project to deploy through svn a cron configuration.\nI immediately thougt that what I should do is cerate symlinks from /etc/cron.d/ to my project's cron file (which in turn is controlled by a vcs), but that seems to not be working.\nI found some old forum messages referring that symlinks were not supported and other saying that they are. Which is it?\nIs there anything else or any other good way to achieve this?\n\nA: I'd check the cron manpage for your version of Ubuntu (I assume we're talking Ubuntu on this forum!):\n\nFiles  in  this directory have to be owned by root, do not need to be\n  executable (they are configuration files, just like /etc/crontab) and\n  must conform to the same naming convention as used by run-parts(8): they must consist solely of upper-  and  lower-case  letters,  digits,\n  underscores, and hyphens.  This  means  that they cannot contain any dots.\n\nAs Florian points out, if this file is writable by non-root users, it's a security hole because the jobs will be run by root (for whoever is named as the job owner in the file). Also note, therefore, that\n\nThis directory can contain any file defining tasks following the format used in /etc/crontab, i.e. unlike the user cron spool,\n  these files must provide the username to run the task as in the task definition.\n\ni.e. pop the username in before the command to run.\n\nA: According to man crond\n\nCAVEATS\nAll crontab files have to be regular files or symlinks  to  regular  files,  they must  not be executable or writable for anyone else but the owner.  This requirement can be overridden by using the -p option on the crond command line.  If inotify  support  is in use, changes in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically noticed by the cron daemon. The cron daemon  must  receive  a  SIGHUP  signal  to reload the crontabs.  This is a limitation of the inotify API.\nThe syslog output will be used instead of mail, when sendmail is not installed.\n\nIt annoyed the living crap out of me as well, In short yes you can use symlinks however, if not a regular file or a symlink to a regular file, it must use -p switch.\n\nA: This has security implications. The scripts in /etc/cron.d/ are run by root with root privileges. It's a bad idea to symlink scripts there that are owned and writable for non-root users, since your system could be compromised that way\n", "Q: No close button in GNOME 3 Well, I have done a new ubuntu 11.04 installation and also added the gnome3-team ppa and installed gnome3, which is running now.\nAll is perfect, except one very annoying issue:\nThe windows I open, have no close button at all!\nThis is not the usual issue that new users have when they find that the maximize and minimize buttons are gone - in my case the close button is gone too, the window bar only has the title of the window in it, nothing else. \nNevertheless I have tried adding those buttons min/max buttons to the :close entry in gconf settings (using gconf-editor or gnome-tweak-tool).

What I am looking for is a way to clone hard drives (mainly windows partitions) while staying inside of the Ubuntu OS.  I do not want to create a partition on the hard drive to boot off of and I am not wanting to use a boot cd.  The only thing I can even think of that is close is the 32bit version of ghost that can run from the desktop in windows.\nIt doesn't have to be clonezilla, but that is the only linux cloning software I have used and have almost used it exclusively since I discovered it.  If there is no way to use clonezilla from the desktop, then I will accept an alternative program.  The main thing is that it clones drives and runs from within Ubuntu.\nThank you for your time in advance\n\nA: Clonezilla uses dd behind the scenes.\nAbout disks and partitions\nA whole disk is a device like /dev/sda. This is the first disk, the second disk is /dev/sdb, the third /dev/sdc, etc. Older disks connected through an IDE cable are named like hda, hdb, ... A disk can have multiple partitions like /dev/sda1. The second partition on disk /dev/sda is /dev/sda2 and so on. An image (literal copy of bytes) can be made from both a partition and disk. Note that first 512 bytes of a disk contains the MBR (Master Boot Record).\nA partition should not be mounted when creating or restoring images, otherwise data loss may occur when reading from it (creating an image) or unexpected bahavior and data corruption if you're writing to it (restoring from a image).\nIn the below examples, /dev/sda1 is the partition from which an image should be created.\nPartitions and disk devices in /dev are only writable by the superuser (root) and users of the disk group. I dislike running everything as root, so for safety (in case you made a typo for example), I change the group temporary to myself, so I can read and write to it:\nsudo chgrp my_user_name /dev/sda1\n\nIf you skip the above command, you've to prefix the below dd commands with sudo.\nBasics\nThe basic command for creating an image from a partition is:\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=disk.img\n\nif means \"input file\", of means \"output file\". Everything in Linux is a file, even devices.\nTo restore such an image, run:\ndd if=disk.img of=/dev/sda1\n\nThe order does not matter, you could have written the above as dd of=/dev/sda1 if=disk.img too.\nCompressed images\nSince partitions are generally big, it's recommended to compress the data before writing it to the image:\ndd if=/dev/sda1 | gzip > disk.img.gz\n\nThis works because if of is omitted, the output is written to \"standard output\" which is the pipe to the compress program gzip. The output of that is written to disk.img.\nTo restore such a compressed image, run:\ngunzip -c disk.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sda1\n\nHere, gunzip is the reverse command of gzip. -c causes the output be written to standard output which is the pipe to the dd command. Because if is omitted on dd, the input is read from \"standard input\" which is the output of gunzip.\nReading from an image without restoring it\nUncompressed images can be mounted so you can read from it. Should you've compressed your partition images, uncompress them first (disk.img.gz will be removed, disk.img will be created. Be sure to have enough space!):\ngunzip disk.img.gz\n\nAlternatively, uncompress an image without touching the image itself:\ngunzip -c disk.img.gz > disk.img\n\nNow create a directory on which the disk can be mounted and mount the image read-only (ro):\nsudo mkdir /mnt/wind\nsudo mount -o ro disk.img /mnt/wind\n\nYou can now view your files in /mnt/wind. When done, unmount it and remove the obsolete mount point:\nsudo umount /mnt/wind\nsudo rmdir /mnt/wind\n\nLess size, more CPU usage, longer backup and restore duration\nIf time is not an issue and you don't have much storage space, you could use the bzip2 compression format. Simply replace gzip by bzip2 in the above. It's common to use the .bz2 extension for bzip2-compressed files, so do so.\n\nA: Do you want to clone one hard disk to other? There are several ways to do that. I generally prefer dd command. Please note that to use this command, you would need sudo access.\n\n\n*\n\n*To clone Hard disk 1 into Hard disk 2. Note that Hard disk 2 must be of greater size than hard disk 1. If your source hard disk is sda and target hard disk is sdb then you can copy all contents of sda to sdb using following command.\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\n\n*To clone whole hard disk 1 into an image, use following command. Note that ~/disk1.img should be residing on different disk\ndd if=/dev/sda of=~/disk1.img\n\n\n*To clone single partition into image, use following command. Note that image file should not reside on same partition.\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=~/drive1.img\n\n\n*To restore image, use following command.\ndd if=drive1.img of=/dev/sda1 - For Partition\ndd if=disk1.img of=/dev/sda   - For whole hard disk\n\n\n*You can also save space by compressing image file.\ngzip disk1.img  - This will generate disk1.img.gz\nbzip2 disk1.img - This will generate disk1.img.bz2\n\nCourtesy: Linux Backup: Hard Disk Clone with \"dd\"\n", "Q: Mikogo icon lancher? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I add applications to the launcher? \n\nI have convinced a few family members to switch to Ubuntu/Kubuntu, however they are half a country away (live in Canada) and I need to be able to guide them through things at some times.\nSo I had them install Mikogo so we can share desktops and I can have remote access, all easily using just meeting ID's after starting the application.\nThe only thing is that to launch it you have to go into the downloaded Mikogo file and double click there.

It uses integrated NVIDIA graphics (listed as a GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 by the NVIDIA X Server Settings utility) with the current proprietary driver as provided by the Additional Drivers utility, and has a VGA connection to a 1680x1050 Acer monitor.\nI used to get the (ugly-looking version of) Plymouth graphical boot screen while under 10.04. It didn't look that great, but I was fine with it. Now, it doesn't show on 11.04 at all during boot (I just get an error message in a moving gray box from the monitor saying \"Input Not Supported\"), and only rarely it will show on shutdown, all garbled up. I could not get GRUB to show during boot while holding down Shift, either (same error message), but pressing Enter while it should be up starts the system normally.\nA picture of the error message I was getting:\n\nOnce fully booted, the system still shows the login screen and desktop just fine.\nAny information on how to troubleshoot this would be appreciated.

In each case, it's displayed a little off-center to the left, with a thin black bar running down the right side of the monitor. The error pictured above no longer shows. I'd say this problem is about 2/3 solved now.\nUPDATE: After Natty started freezing up on me, I decided to dual-boot with Oneiric, which unfortunately shows the same problems. Rather than trying all these workarounds though, I decided to do what I should have done from the start and file a pair of bug reports.\nLAST UPDATE: Bug 850908 has been confirmed as a legitimate nouveaufb bug. I have overwritten my 11.04 partition with 12.04 LTS, and I can confirm at this time that the issue is present there, as well. I will now flag this question to be closed, yet I hope it was helpful for anyone who experienced similar issues; if you are still having the same problem as me, please go there and mark yourself as affected. Thanks!\n\nA: If grub is not displaying correctly, you can try modifying these settings in /etc/default/grub:\n# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024\n\nBy default, grub will try to use the \"preferred\" video resolution as returned by the video card via VBE.  If the mode specified here is not compatible with your monitor, you can try commenting out gfxmode entirely and running sudo update-grub to let it use the video card's default mode; you can set GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 to specify a mode that any VGA-connected monitor should support; or you can uncomment *GRUB_TERMINAL=console* to switch to a text-only mode that should display.\nOnce you're able to load grub, you can get a grub shell by hitting the 'c' key, and can then get information about available video modes with the 'vbeinfo' command; you could then try these one by one until you find the best mode that's compatible with your monitor.  Note that even if your video card supports the 1680x1050 resolution of the monitor, it may not be supported when in BIOS mode; this is what the vbeinfo command tells you.\nIt's also possible that you may need to adjust the settings on the monitor so it will be ok with handling the input you're trying to send it.\nOnce you're able to find a mode that's satisfactory for grub, you should be able to apply the same mode to the uvesafb framebuffer via the kernel commandline to get the same results for plymouth.\n\nA: Did you try setting GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"gfxpayload=true\"? Also set GRUB_GFXMODE and GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX to  both your system and grub supports.\nMaybe some this helps you as well:\nHow do I get my blacked out ttys back?\n\nA: As you are using the Nvidia proprietary driver, may I ask have you looked at the Nivida X Server Settings configuration for that external monitor? May be some adjustment there might make a difference. The Input Not Supported message is coming from the monitor. The signal is coming from the Graphic adapter. So, the issue could be down to incorrect settings in the Nvidia X Server.\n\nA: I have the same issue with my desktop (AMD x4 desktop running 11.04 and NVIDIA drivers) so the problem is with Plymouth not detecting your monitor type. \nPlymouth is an application that runs very early in the boot process (even before the root filesystem is mounted!) that provides a graphical boot animation while the boot process happens in the background.\nThere is a product called Plymouth Manager, and you can add it by going to the terminal and entering ...\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mefrio-g/plymouthmanager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install plymouth-manager\n\nIn that program it allows you to change the resolution at boot up and select the standard theme or a custom theme of your liking.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: you can try installing startup manager. i think the bootloader menu in your case is showing in a resolution of 640x480. i had a similar problem (i think) in which my monitor just shows 'out of range' and pressing enter does the trick (since i'm on dual boot too). there's an option in startup manager to change the resolution, max i think is 1280x1024 or 1900x1200.\n", "Q: Is there any Window Manager like the Windows 7's for Ubuntu? In Windows 7, if you drag a window to the top of the screen, it will maximize, and if you drag to the side, it will restore to half size of the screen on that side.\nIs there any window manager or plugin for Nautilus with this features?\n\nA: Kwin, the window manager that comes with KDE behaves almost exactly like Windows 7 in its newer versions.\n\nA: This worked for me in the past, give this a try and let's see if is yet working.\nIn CompizConfig Settings Manager, let's choose the option \"Commands\" and let's find the list of available commands.

To the right or left edge, it is maximized horizontally, taking up half the width of the screen. \nThere is also keyboard shortcuts: ctrl+alt+1,3,9,7 places the window in the corresponding corner, taking up half the height and half the width of the screen. c-a+4,6 maximizes horizontally and uses half the width of the screen (like dragging it to the left or right) c-a+0 maximizes the window. \nLots of other awesomeness as well :)\n\nA: Unity, the default desktop for 11.04, does the top-screen maximize and the left/right screen thing by default, however it is not available for 10.10.\n\nA: Gnome 3 comes with these features. Drag to the left or right and it fills that half of the screen, drag to the top and it maximizes, and drag a maximized window anywhere and it becomes normal size again. Unfortunately I can't seem to find a good link detailing this, but I'm using it right now.\nApparently GNOME 3 doesn't come with Ubuntu 11.04 by default, but there's a GNOME 3 PPA available according to this GNOME blog post.\nGNOME 3's interface is a lot different than Windows though, so you may not like it. You can always remove it if you don't though.\n", "Q: Install stuck on partitions formatting I'm just doing a base install of Ubuntu Server. The install goes fine until it reaches the Partitions Formatting section. It just goes to 33% and stays there. I have read on some sites that its still formatting even though it stays on 33% and that it will eventually format. But I left it alone for 12 hours and its still the same. The hard drive is 250GB. I don't think that it should take that long should it? I have tried CD, DVD and Unetbootin including versions 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, but they all do the same thing.\nI can install the Ubuntu desktop version quickly with no problems though.\n\nA: It should not take this long at all.  Do not rule out that there is something wrong with the drive.  It is even possible, though lately rare, for older hard drive firmware to cause general performance issues.  Check with the manufacturer.  However, my first instinct would be to suspect something is up with the drive.\nAlso, and you did not indicate, but I have some experience with this.  Mostly on real hardware RAID there is a config pushed to the drive.  The drive knows it's a member of a raid array.  The only way I currently know to reset it is to put the drive back onto a raid controller and let it clear the config.  And no doubt, there are probably many more ways to accomplish this.\nGoing back to my instinct, I would grab an Ubuntu 11.04 or 10.10 live disk.  One that you know is good.  Boot the box live, go to a terminal, and run a tool called:\npalimpset\n\nThis will show you the SMART data currently on the drive.  If there are high amounts of sector errors, it will be fairly quick to let you know.  It's pretty neat because you can get the total time the drive has ran, its current temperature, etc.  I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Resolvconf -u gives the error \"resolvconf: Error: /etc/resolv.conf must be a symlink\" I use resolvconf to have static DNS servers set in /etc/resolv.conf.

Problem solved I guess.\n\nA: I'm going to leave the link alone because I think it still has some valuable information.  And I'm going to assume you've done everything that you feel is related to your problem.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1684460\n\nWell hell Jeff, all of your query info shows that it should work.  Only thing I can think of is in the back of my mind maybe force the sli=on instead of auto.  I know auto is supposed to handle it and be the same but syntax can do crazy things.  Maybe just for s's and g's.\nOther than that I got nothing.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, but following the tutorial on the ubuntuforums that someone posted here sorted it all out. X.org was starting fine but it performed poorly and was highly unstable, but setting vmalloc to 256M in Grub fixed it completely. Hope this helps if you're still struggling with this.\n", "Q: What do \".\" and \"..\" mean when in a folder? when I used ls -a to view hidden files in folder there were 2 hidden files created by default what is the significance of this two files . and ..?\nls -a\n\nProduces\n.  ..\n\n\nA: Those are hardlinks to self (.) and parent (..) directories. They are created when you crate a directory. They can never be deleted (without deleting directory pointed by them).\nIf you create a directory:\nmkdir /tmp/foo\n\nyou can see, that there are actually 2 hardlink to /tmp/foo:\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 michal michal 4096 2011-08-07 18:40 /tmp/foo\n           ^---- two hardlinks\n\nfirst is from /tmp/ directory pointing to /tmp/foo, and the second is the '.' with in /tmp/foo/ pointing to it self.\n\nA: . is the current folder.\n.. is the folder above the current folder - the folder that contains the current folder.\nYou will sometimes see that single dot in use when someone wants to run a script from their home directory. For instance: ./install-app.sh. That means the file \"install-app.sh\" is in the current directory. It would be just as valid to do /home/username/directory/install-app.sh. The same way, you could also do ../install.app if the file is in the parent directory. The reason why it is this way, is not only for navigation, but also that it shouldn't be possible to accidentally hide system applications simply by misnaming a file in your home directory. \n\nA: Also, note that you can use ls -A (instead of ls -a) to list all files including hidden files, but excluding the . and .. directories.\n\nA: . currect folder\n.. parent folder\n", "Q: how do you mount network drives? When I access a network folder using nautilus it shows up in the Places sidebar, but not in any other application's save/open Places sidebar. Why the inconsistency, and how can I add a share so every application has access to it without having to edit fstab?\n\nA: By default network shares are mounted in the hidden directory ~/.gvfs in our home directory. You can browse there with any application provided you have enabled to display hidden folders.\nsmbnetfs\nWith this tool we are also able to mount network shares as a non-root user in any newly created folder in our home directories. For a short explanation on how to use it see this answer.\n\nA: You can mount network disk through terminal by command:\nmount -t cifs -o username=myusername,password=mysharepassword //myipaddress/mysharefolder /myPCdirfolder\n\nMake sure package cifs-utils is installed. After logout network disk will be dismounted.\n", "Q: unzip error \"End-of-central-directory signature not found\" I try to unzip a zip file, but got an error:\n$ unzip COCR2_100.zip \nArchive:  COCR2_100.zip\n  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not\n  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the\n  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on\n  the last disk(s) of this archive.\nnote:  COCR2_100.zip may be a plain executable, not an archive\nunzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of COCR2_100.zip or\n        COCR2_100.zip.zip, and cannot find COCR2_100.zip.ZIP, period.\n\nI googled but didn't find a solution. I was wondering why it is and how I should fix it? Thanks!\nThe zip file can be downloaded from COCR2_100. It is an application, and here is its website http://users.belgacom.net/chardic/cocr2.html.\nMy OS is 10.10.\n\nA: I had a similar issue today and had some success with dd and gunzip. Try this:\ndd if=corrupt.zip | gunzip -f > xx.csv\n\nIn my case I still got the \"gunzip: stdin: unexpected end of file\" error but at least I got some output to view.\n\nA: Error can be caused by mixing up archive types:\nI noticed that when using unzip, but on a gunzip (GNU) archive I would get this error, e.g.\n\nEnd-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is\n  not   a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.\n  In the   latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be\n  found on   the last disk(s) of this archive. unzip:  cannot find\n  zipfile directory in one of create_tables.sql.gz or\n          create_tables.sql.gz.zip, and cannot find create_tables.sql.gz.ZIP, period.\"\n\nUsing gunzip on this same archive performed without errors.  !!\n\nA: Unzipping with 7z worked for me:\n7z x COCR2_100.zip\n\n\nInstall via APT with apt install p7zip-full.\n\nA: The problem is exactly what it says. Unzip can't find the line of code that signals the end of the archive, so either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The archive is corrupt.\n\n*It is not a .zip archive.\n\n*There are more than 1 parts to the archive, but that doesn't seem possible to me.\nYou should try the other mirror too. It worked for me.\n\n\nP.S. Notice how the program is made for Windows. So you need Wine (from http://www.winehq.com or the Ubuntu Software Center) to run it.\n\nA: Try this excellent solution:\njar xvf COCR2_100.zip\n\nsteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*drag and drop file into terminal window.\n\n*use keyboard arrows to navigate to start of line in terminal\n\n*type jar xvf in front of your file name, remembering to leave space before the start of your file name.\n\n*grab a beer and watch terminal work its magic as it extracts files. \n\n\nThe location of where the new files go varies, but usually best trick to find them is click on your computer name in Finder which should display most recent activity at top of all files.\nIf the jar command is not available, you can install fastjar by pasting the following in terminal: \nsudo apt-get install fastjar\n\n\nA: I think the guys/gals that responded to you is on the right track it is very well a corrupted file. If that is the case then try another mirror to download the file. Your may try to install rar by opening terminal  sudo apt-get install rar  which for a true zip file rar is a little overkill. However it does add support for other formats and  allows you to extracts different file types.\n", "Q: Which Gmail Notifier do you use? There are plenty of them.\nWhich one would you recommend?\nIs there one which notifies about unread buzz posts?\n\nA: gm-notify : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gm-notify\nIt integrates best for notifying, but not for managing the e-mail straight from it (like checkgmail) or describing the content of the e-mail after the notification.\n\n\nA: This is the one I use and works perfect: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+source/gm-notify/\nThere is also this one which I tried and also works good (Include gmail, reader, etc..): http://sourceforge.net/projects/googsystray/\nSo you have a choice of a pop balloon like or a small icon in tray that notifies you.\n\nA: I use WebMail Notifier - it's a firefox extension. When new mail comes (and you have firefox turned on) - small message pops-up at the bottom rigth corner of the screen.

I was writing a script and needed a list of all currently supported versions of Ubuntu.\nIf any of you guys know of either a downloadable files which contains all versions with dates or a simple list of all currently supported versions. That would be great. Obviously they would have to be locations where Canonical keeps them up to date so the scripts continue to work into the future.\nAnd it should be something which works on older versions of Ubuntu, say any supported version (lucid+) etc.\n\nA: You can use the parse the output from ubuntu-support-status. That will list what software is unsupported, and how long the others are supported. For instance, LAMP services are supported for 5 years on an LTS desktop even if the desktop itself is only supported for three years. That command will reflect that. It will also show you that packages from universe, multiverse, etc, are not supported at all.  \nHere's an example:\nyou@ubuntu:~$ ubuntu-support-status\nSupport status summary of 'ubuntu':\n\nYou have 1873 packages (89.5%) supported until October 2014 (18m)\n\nYou have 14 packages (0.7%) that can not/no-longer be downloaded\nYou have 206 packages (9.8%) that are unsupported\n\nRun with --show-unsupported, --show-supported or --show-all to see more details\n\n\nA: To place all supported names in a list instead of printing them:\nfrom launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad\n\nlaunchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously('series-support-check')\nnames = [ s.name for s in launchpad.distributions[\"ubuntu\"].series if s.active ]\n\n\nA: You can use launchpadlib to do this. For example, in python:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad\n\nlp = Launchpad.login_anonymously('series-support-check')\nfor series in lp.projects['ubuntu'].series:\n    print series.name, series.supported\n\nFor more info about the launchpad API, check out the web services API help or the API reference.\n\nA: It is not hard to see the pattern in release dates. If you go to Wikipedia, you can see that the normal releases are supported for 1 1/2 years, while the LTS (Long Term Support, released in April of every other year) are supported for 3 years. As there is a release every 6 months (in April and October) it is easy to build a script from that information.\n", "Q: If I've signed the Canonical Contributors agreement, do I have to sign the new Harmony Agreement?

It's a GUI utility to assist in mounting NTFS drives automatically during bootup.\nStart a package manager, search for ntfs, install. You'll find the program in System tools.\n\nA: If some Microsoft computers can see your computer and others can't. That tells me that the configuration on your computer is ok.

Could you please give some details (about how to do)?\nThank you.\n\nA: There are at least three \"appropriate\" ways to do startup things in Ubuntu (presuming you don't merely want to mount it), listed here in decreasing order of preference:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/init/*.conf (Upstart)\n\n*/etc/init.d/* (sysvinit)\n\n*/etc/rc.local (runlevel change script)\n\n\nThere's also to possibility of using udev rules, but it will be convoluted.  I recommend against it.  The sysvinit script is overkill for such a small thing, so I'll focus on the other two options.  The runlevel change script is simplest (though least preferred), so I'll start there.\nThe /etc/rc.local file is simply executed by the /etc/init.d/rc.local sysvinit script, which is (by default) executed last upon switching to any normal \"on\" runlevel (e.g. when you boot normally, but not when you shut down or go to recovery mode).  To implement setting up the boot device, just add this at the end of /etc/rc.local, assuming that your file is called /srv/diskimage and you wish to use /dev/loop0 as the loop device:\nlosetup /dev/loop0 /srv/diskimage\n\nThat's really all there is to it.  Of course, replace the filenames with whatever works best on your setup.\nIf you want to be a bit more specific about it, you can create an Upstart job for it that sets it up once the filesystem holding it has been mounted.  An example would be the following, assuming that /srv was the mount point containing your diskimage file:\ndescription     \"Setup loop devices after filesystems are mounted\"\n\nstart on mounted MOUNTPOINT=/srv\ntask\nexec losetup /dev/loop0 /srv/diskimage\n\nThis should be simple enough to follow conceptually: The first line is just a comment for human readers, and it's instructions to Upstart to wait until the /srv filesystem is mounted, execute the losetup process, and consider yourself finished when the process exits successfully (a \"task\", as opposed to a service that is persistent).  Just put those contents in a file matching /etc/init/*.conf.  I would choose /etc/init/losetup.conf, myself.\nThe advantages of Upstart jobs over /etc/rc.local for such a simple thing are small but important.  First, /etc/rc.local is deprecated, and its use as just a \"messy sandbox to get things done\" is frowned upon by pretty much everyone these days.  Among other reasons for frowning upon its use, some programs that do use that file will simply overwrite the contents, and it's difficult to reconcile different scripts that need to go into the same file.  Second, Upstart actually handles the dependency checking for you (making sure the filesystem is mounted first), so if there's a problem mounting the filesystem it won't try to set up the loop device....but will once you've resolved and mounted it.  Third, Upstart is vastly more flexible: you can, for instance, have it be smart enough to find an unused loop device, and \"emit\" that loop device for use in other upstart jobs, similar to how we used the \"MOUNTPOINT\" variable in this example above.\n\nA: As @psusi pointed out, the easiest way is to add the following line into your /etc/fstab file\n/path/to/loop/device       /path/to/mount/point       auto       loop       0 0\n\nNow reboot or run mount -a as root. Then the device should be mounted. You can check that with lsblk.\n", "Q: setting up ufw for a website, I want to to disallow everything except ssh, e-mail, and http I have read the basic instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nI want to sudo ufw default deny and then\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nsudo ufw allow smtp\nsudo ufw allow www\nsudo ufw allow https\nsudo ufw allow imaps\n\nto allow the services I need, am I missing anything ? I assume allowing ssh will also allow scp ? (heck I will allow sftp as well anyway).\nHowever my problem is I am connecting remotely, so the only way I can do what I want is to actually do a sudo ufw default allow then use a list of the services provided by less /etc/services and deny each service individually? This seems a pain as if I turn on the firewall with default deny it will boot me out of my ssh connection?\n\nA: The easiest solution is to find your current IP, and first do the following:\n\nsudo ufw allow in from 192.168.1.100\n\nWhere 192.168.1.100 would be your current IP.  This way you don't block yourself out from the machine.\n\nA: This is an old question, but still valid, and the answers given aren't exactly complete, so for those stumbling across this...\nThe best way to use ufw is to close everything first, then re-open ports one by one as needed. The OP was correct in that you must be careful if you're doing this over SSH (although his solution is backwards): you don't want to lock yourself out, so execute these commands before enabling ufw. As an example:\n    sudo ufw default deny incoming\n    sudo ufw default allow outgoing\n    sudo ufw allow ssh\n    sudo ufw allow http\n        ...etc\n    sudo ufw enable\n\nIn summary, set the rules first, including allowing SSH, before enabling them.\n", "Q: I need Mercurial 1.8.x back I'm getting Mercurial from this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~mercurial-ppa/+archive/releases/+packages?field.name_filter=mercurial&field.status_filter=&field.series_filter=\nThe Eclipse plugin MercurialEclipse (former HgEclipse) doesn't work well with version 1.9.0.

For some reason I can't install Ubuntu from CD or USB, so that I had to installed Ubuntu via Wubi. But I install Ubuntu into partition 'D' and partition of Win 7 is 'C'. If I re-install win 7, how can I use pre-installed Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Don't uninstall Wubi - it will delete the virtual disk and completely remove your entire Ubuntu install. To safeguard this copy D:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk (and any other virtual disks) completely out of the D:\\ubuntu directory.\nYou have a couple of options:\n1.Reinstall Windows 7 and leave D: completely untouched. Then you'll have to use bcdedit or easyBCD to add back an entry for D:\\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr and also copy the D:\\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr file to C:\\\n2.\n Move the *.disk outside of the D:\\ubuntu folder before deleting D:\\ubuntu. Reinstall Windows 7 and also reinstall the same release of Ubuntu with Wubi again. Then before rebooting to complete the install, copy back the *.disk files back into the D:\\ubuntu\\disks folder. This works without any tweaking provided your partition numbering hasn't been altered (i.e. you haven't split C: or resized D: etc)\nIn that case, you'll need to manually tweak the grub menu entry to boot. That's a bit more painful but not too bad if you have someone helping.\nHowever, since you have a dedicated D: partition for Ubuntu, you could just migrate your Wubi install to it. Most likely you had a bad burn on the CD and a bad ISO on the USB if you couldn't install from CD/USB before.\nEdit: A bit more info to explain how a Wubi install boots\nWubi installs to the virtual disk - root.disk - and this is a fully contained bootable Ubuntu OS. But it needs to be jump started. So the windows bootloader calls wubildr.mbr (grub4dos) and this finds and transfers control to the first wubildr it finds in the root of any partition (C:\\wubildr). Wubildr contains enough of grub2 to locate the root.disk - on any partition provided it is in the /ubuntu/disks/ directory. So that's why adding wubildr.mbr to the windows bootloader, and copying wubildr to C:\\ works.\nWubildr will loopmount the root.disk and find it's /boot/grub/grub.cfg and present this as the grub menu. This is where the catch comes in. Up to this point, it doesn't matter which partition or drive anything has been on. The grub.cfg contains explicit drive/partition info and the UUID of the partition as well. If you've copied a root.disk from one partition to another it won't boot. If, as in your case, drive D: was unmodified, it will work fine. If e.g. you moved it to C: you'd need to make some changes.\ne.g. if D: is /dev/sda2 and C: is /dev/sda1, then you'd hit 'e' on the first entry of the grub menu and change:\nset root=(hd0,2) becomes set root=(hd0,1)\nDelete the line - search --no-floppy xxx (as this overrides the previous set root command using the old UUID)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-xxxx root=/dev/sda2 ... becomes linux /boot/vmlinuz-xxx root=/dev/sda1 ...\nThis is a one-time override - hit CTRL+x to boot, and make sure you run sudo update-grub after booting to fix the grub.cfg menu so it works the next time.\nPS there may be some variations. (hd0,2) could be (hd0, msdos2) or (/dev/sda, msdos2) depending on the version of Grub. Also root=/dev/sda2 may be root=UUID=xxxxx\n", "Q: How to cross-compile an existing deb package from 64bit to 32bit architecture I have rebuilt a deb package with a custom patch for my computer which is a 64bit machine. I did it using:\nsudo apt-get -b source [package name]\n\nNow my question is, how to do that in a similar manner to cross-compile the same package for 32bit machines?\nThanks, \nNicolay\n\nA: It is mostly not possible to cross-compile a 32bit package from a 64bit deb package if the package contains any source files or libraries.\nYou'll need to repackage using the 32bit libraries and recompile the source code.\nMy suggestion would be to split your compile and packaging - do your 32bit work in a separate 32bit Virtual Machine.\nPerhaps better, would be to set up a LaunchPad PPA and let Launchpad do the compiling for both 64bit and 32bit architectures automatically.\n\nA: You can use a cross-compile environment and/or some helper tools.\nPersonally I favour xdeb it have never failed me!\nThis guide: Using Xdeb will help you setup the Xdeb environment and how to use the tools.\n", "Q: How do I use a USB joystick to generate MIDI data to control audio apps?

Is it possible to add a user in ubuntu linux without useradd command I think its possible by adding the entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow but i don't know the exact steps to do it and the user should get its home directory and bash shell too.\n\nA: It's not recommended to manually modify /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group or /etc/gshadow because the risk of breakage. If you're looking for an alternative command that is easier to use, take a look at adduser(8). All you have to run is:\nsudo adduser user\n\nThe shell will be /bin/bash by default per /etc/adduser.conf.\nUsually, if you wish to add a user with the bash shell, thereby create a home directory /home/user and a user group, you would use:\nsudo useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash --user-group user\n\nThis command is basically determining a free User ID $UID and Group ID $GID and then executing the next commands:\necho \"user:x:$UID:$GID::/home/user:/bin/bash\" | sudo tee -a /etc/passwd\necho \"user:x:$GID:\" | sudo tee -a /etc/group\necho \"user:!:$DATE_OF_LAST_PASS_CHANGE:0:99999:7:::\" | sudo tee -a /etc/shadow\necho \"user:!::\" | sudo tee -a /etc/gshadow\n\n..and thereby possibly making a backup of the files.\nThe next manual pages about the file formats may be of interest to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*passwd(5)\n\n*group(5)\n\n*shadow(5)\n\n*gshadow(5)\n\nA: Although not usually necessary or recommended, the answer to the question of How to add user without useradd command is to use sudo vipw\nThis will launch your system-defined editor while locking the passwd file. Enter a line for a new user. (In vi, shift-G to get to the last line then yy p to duplicate it.) Edit the username and create a unique user ID number. \nAfter saving the file and exiting the editor, you'll be prompted to edit /etc/shadow. Use the same technique to create a new line and use \"*\" for the password hash. The new account is locked. Use passwd username to unlock it and set a password.\nIt's also necessary to create a home directory, copy files from the skeleton directory, set group permissions, etc. But vipw is your main resource.

However, a fix was committed in late 2013. This change didn't make it into Ubuntu 14.04, but it should be part of Ubuntu 14.10.\nAccording to the issue on Launchpad, you can have this feature today by enabling the Gnome-team PPA.

And, basically, Gnome Terminal doesn't quite cut it ..\nI have often used Windows-based SecureCRT and SecureFX (SFTP) on both XP and Win7, as well as on Ubuntu (under Wine), giving me a much better set of features, including: multi-windows and/or tabs, saved settings, login macros, by-session colorization, much customization, integrated SFTP, and even scripting ..  There were always minor glitches (with Wine, partic. with SFTP), and I often strayed back to Gnome Terminal for local tasks on Ubuntu.\nHowever, since early this year (in beta), I have had SecureCRT (native to Ubuntu).  Other than getting tighter integration with Nautilus (or something) for SFTP/SSH file transfer, this has nearly replaced my use of Gnome Terminal.\nEven new machine setup is better with hassle-free cut & paste, full session capture, and saved connection settings.  It has always had superior re-size, re-flow, and character-set handling even over most of the other terminal apps.\nI've not tried it, but it has also just been released for Mac OS X v1.5 (Intel), or v10.6+.\n", "Q: Enable HDMI audio for an Nvidia card I am using a GTX470 with an HDMI output, this card is able to handle the video and audio.

It allows to install/launch/uninstall multiple versions of Firefox using multiple profiles, directly from your default Firefox.\nKeep in mind that FoxTester is designed for testing multiple Firefox builds and not for managing profiles intended for long term usage. If you uninstall a Firefox build installed by FoxTester, it will remove all traces of it, including the profile.\nFoxTester install all FF versions and creates the corresponding profiles in the foxtester folder, inside the Firefox profile where FoxTester is installed.\nIf you want more control over your profiles, then use the standalone profile manager instead. But don't use it to manage FoxTester profiles.\n", "Q: Recommendations for a backup solution? I'm looking for a backup solution for a specific use case. If none exists, then I'm tempted to make one. \nI have a large and growing collection of video files. On my workstation I have a fairly large disk in RAID5, consisting of a few 2TB disks, which is easily expandable. These files are never changed. If I need to edit one, then I create a new file. I use hotswapable 2.5\" harddisks for backup, which so far I've done manually. It works, but I'm afraid of doing anything wrong. I might forget to copy a file, mislabel a disk, etc.\nI would like a solution that watches the video files on my workstation, automatically copies new files to the current backup disk and presents me with an overview of which backup disk contains which files, descriptions, dates and where those disks are physically stored. It would be nice if I could just insert an unformatted disk and it would be formatted, labeled and tracked automatically. When the free space of a backup disk reaches a certain level, I should be notified so that I can store it safely and replace it with a new one. Each backup disk should contain a copy of the current database and thumbnails for the videofiles contained on this disk.\nFor restore, I should be able to simply provide a root directory where the hierarchy should be recreated and it would then tell me to \"insert disk x\" -- like installing Windows 95 from floppies. \nDoes anyone know of a free backup solution that fits this profile, or should I go ahead and make one? \n\nA: I don't think there's an existing solution that offers exactly what you describe. You would have to write a couple of scripts, starting with something like fsniper  that watches for new files and then triggering the addition of this file to a text file tracking all files, copying the file to the harddisk, complaining if the disk is full etc. It is of course feasible, but involves a lot of work and has a lot of pitfalls that existing backup solutions take care of coping with (e.g. handling a crash during the copy of a file).\nAnother solution (that does not store plain files on the disk and does not allow any nice thumbnail preview) is using a powerful backup solution like bacula , that is built for enterprise grade backups and can cope with backing up to multiple tape drives. You can then adapt such a solution to use harddrives instead of tape drives, as explained here on the bacula wiki\nA software that might be useful for your current workflow (manual copying of new files) is “Virtual Volumes View” (short: VVV):\n\nVVV is an application that catalogs the content of removable\n  volumes like CD and DVD disks for off-line searching. Folders and\n  files can also be arranged in a single, virtual file system. Each\n  folder of this virtual file system can contain files from many disks\n  so you can arrange your data in a simple and logical way.\n\nUnfortunately it's not available in the repositories but has to be compiled from source.\n\nA: I'm using a simple script for rsync. It syncs my laptop with an external hard drive.\nIt keeps (a) some folders in external drive only [LTDS list folder for that], (b) others are synced with local drive [LTDD list folders for that], (c) also dot files are backed-up [last 4 lines of the script do that].\nMy external hard dirve is called box. And in a script it's hardcoded, as a distination path is: DEST=\"/media/box\".\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This script provides two types of backups\n# * LTDS (stands for 'list delete orig at source'): the one which delete files on the DEST, and\n# * LTDD (stands for 'list delete orig at destination'): the one which doesn't.\n# Note that starting DEST folders has to be before the sync.\n# Type in the lists the folders subject to the sync (all paths reletive to the $HOME):\n\n# for movies and soft (to keep them at the remote HDD only):\nLTDS=\"/Box/mixed/Movies/\"\n# for songs, books, documents (to keep them synced both: at HOME and at remote HDD):\nLTDD=\"/Box/sonic/ /Box/visual/ /Box/wordy/ /Documents/ /Downloads/ /Passed/ /Pictures/ /Study/ /Work/\"\n\nDEST=\"/media/box\"\n\nfor i in $LTDS; do\n    rsync -aq --progress $HOME$i $DEST$i\n    rm -rf $HOME$i*\ndone\n\nfor i in $LTDD; do\n    rsync -aq --delete-after --progress $HOME$i $DEST$i\ndone\n\n# the following back-ups all the dot files in your home dir.\ndotfiles=`ls -A | grep '\\.'`\nfor i in $dotfiles; do\n    rsync -aq --progress $HOME/$i $DEST/Misc/dotfiles\ndone\n\nI'm using that script for quite now. It works fine.\n\nA: You might want to look into rsync.  I know it's a bit scary b/c its a command line tool, but there is a GUI for it, grsync which you can find in synaptic or do \nsudo apt-get install grsync\n\nThere are a ton of options for the backup and the -i option gives you an itemized changes list.  It should fit the ticket. See the wikipedia page\n", "Q: ubuntu *sometimes* restarts when i try to shutdown (shutdown -P now, halt, init 0) I have had Ubuntu running fine from usb external hd.

Some further research on the web (http://blogs.kde.org/node/2270) gives me the impression that Linux file systems do not much fragment in the sense of splitting files into pieces, but they spread files in a random order over the disk (to avoid fragmentation).\nIs that true? \nIs there a way to force the system to place all boot files (or all files of one application etc.) in a linear order?\n\nA: This is probably not the answer you want to hear, but: buy a faster disk.  A SSD, if you can afford it (but do some research first; cheap SSDs used to be slower than HDDs).\nFailing that, getting more RAM so it can be used for the disk cache may be an option.  Especially if you have a laptop and use suspend instead of shutting down.  It won't help for the initial startup, but launching applications you've recently closed will be faster.  This assumes that your current speed problems are caused by lack of RAM; if you've got enough, it won't help at all.\n", "Q: How to setup Thunderbird to sign outgoing email messages with my GPG key?

I am trying to write an Juju formula for App::Alice, a web based IRC client.\nAccording to the the installation instructions I execute the following commands to snag Alice and all of it's dependencies from CPAN:\ncurl -L http://xrl.us/cpanm | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus\ncpanm --sudo --installdeps App::Alice\n\nI wrote the formula to do this so when it launches an EC2 instance it installs the entire thing, here's my install hook:\n#!/bin/bash\nDEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libnet-ssleay-perl\nset -eux # -x for verbose logging to juj debug-log\ncurl -L http://xrl.us/cpanm | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus\ncpanm --sudo --installdeps App::Alice\n\nThe problem is that it took about 10 minutes on an m1.small to snag and build everything from CPAN. This is too long to wait, especially if I'm going to pay for 10 minutes of computing time every time I want to run Alice! So I was thinking if I could install the CPAN modules that already exist as packages and add it to the apt-get line that this would save a bunch of time. \nRight away I got an error when using Alice that it needed SSL, so I added the libnet-ssleay-perl package to the right line.\nMy problem is that I don't want to run the install and manually determine which modules it needs, search for it in the archive, and then add it.\nIs there a tool or method that will just enable me to figure out which modules Alice needs that are packaged so I can install those from the archive or do I need to go search for each one?\n\nA: I looked in Makefile.PL and found this:\nall_from 'lib/Alice.pm';\nrequires 'List::MoreUtils' => '0';\nrequires 'Any::Moose' => '0';\nrequires 'Try::Tiny' => '0';\nrequires 'EV' => '0';\nrequires 'AnyEvent' => '5.2';\nrequires 'AnyEvent::AIO' => '0';\nrequires 'AnyEvent::IRC' => '0.95';\nrequires 'AnyEvent::HTTP' => '0';\nrequires 'Twiggy' => '0';\nrequires 'Plack' => '0';\nrequires 'Plack::Session' => '0';\nrequires 'DBD::SQLite' => '0';\nrequires 'SQL::Abstract' => '0';\nrequires 'AnyEvent::DBI' => '0';\nrequires 'IRC::Formatting::HTML' => '0.28';\nrequires 'Text::MicroTemplate' => '0.09';\nrequires 'JSON' => '2.12';\nrequires 'File::ShareDir' => '0.01';\nrequires 'File::Copy' => '0';\nrequires 'Net::SSLeay' => '0';\ntest_requires 'Test::More' => '0.86';\ntest_requires 'Test::TCP' => '0';\ninstall_share 'share';\ninstall_script 'bin/alice';\n\nThis enabled me to search for each individual package.

What is the current level of support for Intel Light Peak connection devices in Linux? Has anyone seen any of these in a Linux system?\nhttp://www.intel.com/technology/io/thunderbolt/index.htm\n\nA: The best information I've been able to find so far was this proposal for a talk at the upcoming Linux Plumbers Conference by a member of Intel’s LAN Access Division (LAD):\n\nWhile there is no real immediate need for added software, LAD will be supplying initial software for peer-to-peer use in Linux and other OSes. LAD will also be working on enablement code for Open Source OSes so that others will be able to use that code. LAD may also supply other use case but initially only peer-to-peer will be done. LAD has not come up with all the use cases that the Open Source community and other are going to come up with for this technology.\n\nThe conference is scheduled for September 9th and I'm sure whatever he presents will be covered by typical Linux media, so I guess we'll know then.\n\nA: please also see this thread, where there is some updated information\nIs the Intel Thunderbolt interface supported in Ubuntu Linux?\nas of today, there is still no \"real\" tunderbolt support in ubuntu, sadly :(\n\nA: a real Thunderbolt support is currently in kernel 3.12.

I have a folder which has appeared called u1conflict.  The original file is totally blank.  I can't open the document in its original formatting from the u1conflict file, and I'm feeling a little mistrustful of ubuntu one now since I'm trying to complete my Masters dissertation!\nHow do I open the original document in LibreOffice?\nHow do I stop this from happening again?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can simply make a copy of the .u1conflict file and rename it. If there are more of them, then you might want to open them and see which is which. Nothing is lost. That's what the .u1conflict files are for. \nThis can happen if you're working directly in a synced folder with an application that automatically saves, like LibreOffice Writer. I think what happens is that while you're uploading the previous changes, LibreOffice changes your local file. That means that the file you are uploading is not the same as the local file and not the same as the file on Ubuntu One. It's not perfect, but the internet does not work in absolute time, and syncing is very difficult. I think Ubuntu One does the right thing. All collaborative tools must have a way of handling conflicts. Whether you're syncing contacts between mobile phones or working on source code in a version control system, conflicts will happen from time to time and it really needs to be handled by a human being. You really don't want the computer to judge which version of your document has the best content.  \nThe only time I have experienced this was when working on a LO Writer document directly on a synced folder. I've stopped doing that, and now instead work on an unsynced folder and then copy the file to a synced folder. I believe you can prevent it from happening by reducing the autosave frequency or deactivating it, but I haven't tried that myself. In my case, LibreOffice Writer autosaved every two minutes, and because of bad connection, it took three minutes to upload the file. Then it makes sense that there will be lots of conflicts. \nBut as I said, the conflict files are plain copies of your files, so nothing is lost. \n", "Q: Samsung SCX-3201 MFP scanner not working I have a Samsung SCX-3201 MFP multifunction printer and after plugging it into the computer it recognises the printer part, but the scanner is not detected. \nSince that I've fresh installed and did not try it again. The built-in scan application nor SANE detects it.\nI did try Samsung's proprietary software.Neither did it detect it\n\nA: Not Supported\nHaving checked the stable version of the SANE libraries that is included in Ubuntu from the sane-project website, the scanner in question is not yet supported.\nTo double check this you'll need your USB identifier that you can obtain using lsusb.\nThe SCX range of scanners use the sane-xerox_mfp back-end.\nChecking the unstable version (the version you will need to compile from GIT source) again your scanner is not supported.\nPossible solution\nPossibly you can add your model if it is similar to one of the listed models in the above links.  This involves adding the USB ID to /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf together with similar information to the SANE rules in /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules\nObviously change the values to match your scanner.\nTo give you an example add the following text to /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf:\n#Samsung CLX-3185FW\nusb 0x04e8 0x343d\n\nand /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules by adding\n# Samsung CLX-3185FW\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"04e8\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"343d\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\n\nMake sure you install the following package:\nsudo apt-get install acl\n\nsource\nIf the above does not work, try also adding your user account to groups lp and scanner by:\nsudo usermod -a -G lp [username]\nsudo usermod -a -G scanner [username]\n\n", "Q: Should I mix Kubuntu PPAs? If i am using the ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports ppa and the ppa:kubuntu-ppa, will there be any interference between the two? So in essence should i disable the ppa:kubuntu-ppa ppa?\nThanks\n\nA: The Kubuntu PPA contains point releases for KDE software - i.e. slightly newer packages that are intended to go into Ubuntu Updates eventually.\nThe Backports PPA contains very new packages that are often not extensively tested.  Be prepared for breakages and other stuff that may not work correctly.  However, its an excellent PPA to test the latest cutting edge software - at the time of writing this, it contains KDE 4.7 whilst the default Natty configuration is KDE 4.6.\nThe packages in the Backports PPA will be higher in number, so will take precedence over any similarly named packages in the Kubuntu PPA or in the standard repositories.

I used grub-customizer to remove some old entries, but I made a mistake and now there's only Windows left in GRUB.\nI tried booting into ubuntu through grub's command line but I don't know how to do anything there. Just booting once would be enough, or, if possible, fixing the listing right there in the command line.\n\nA: Whilst the question is not identical, the answer is the same as this AU Question\nIn summary - boot from a LiveCD and recreate your Grub as per both these linked answers.\n\nA: Your Grub is still there. You want to boot into Ubuntu and then run Grub Customizer and mark at least one kernel to appear in the Grub menu.\nMay I suggest that you do indeed run a live CD and browse the file system to boot/grub/grub.cfg? You do not need to edit this file. But find the part of the file that Grub uses to boot Ubuntu. Copy it down and use some of it as commands at the Grub command prompt to load into that kernel image. The key line would be the line that begins linux /boot/vmlinuz ... You may need to run each of the lines in that part of the menu entry one at a time in the order that they are listed.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Suspending Ubuntu Session when Laptop lid is Closed... I'm using a Toshiba satellite L305 running Ubuntu. One issue, the laptop usually suspends itself when the lid closed, however Ubuntu only does this half of the time, the other half it keeps the system running. Very inconvenient, because when I put my laptop in my briefcase, if it's not suspended, it's just blowing hot air, can't be good for the computer.\nI don't think it's a hardware issue, because when I was running Windows on this machine I never had this problem.\n\nA: I would like to suggest first (unless you have done already)  that you hit the unity button in the corner or win/super key and type Power Management. \nHere you should be able to select what action happens when you shut the laptop lid ie suspend/blank screen. It usually works on my laptop but more often than not. \n\nApologies if you have done this already but for some people it is an easier method\nLet us know how you get on.\n\nA: search for ACPI fixes, my asus wouldn't suspend, but a few lines of code in a wiki fixed it.\n", "Q: How does Software Center determine what is a \"technical item\" and what isn't? I'm a total newb to packaging, but I managed to get a PPA set up and working. But when I look for my software in Ubuntu Software Center, it will only show up after clicking \"Show _ technical items\". My software is not a technical item. How do I convey this information to the Software Center so it can appropriately categorize it?\nI ship a .desktop file and it shows up in the menu perfectly. Software Center even lists the path to the menu entry after I install it (\"Find it in the menu: ...\").\nEDIT: I spent some time on various Ubuntu IRC channels, and from conversations with a couple different people, the consensus seems to be that there is no way to fix this issue (and a couple others, such as showing an icon) for PPA packages. The way things are now, packages have to be in the main repos to fully integrate with Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: Technical packages are ones that don't show up in the user menus.  That is, if you package ships a .desktop file, it will be considered non-technical.\n", "Q: makeinitramfs and grub-update for compiled Ubuntu Linux Kernel I'm modifying the Ubuntu Kernel and I've noticed: Whenever I install Kernel updates from the main repos initramfs and grub are updated automatically. However, in compiled kernels these steps are completed outside of the install of the newly created kernel.\nI'm loosely following the directions from: Ubuntu KerenelTeam Wiki: Git Kernel Building\nHow can I produce the same effect for my version of the kernel packages? Would this require a third package that depends on the image/header produced which then runs the final setup scripts?\n\nA: I recommend using what is documented in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile instead of the make-kpkg way. This way you'll actually build the package exactly the same way it is built in the archive.\n", "Q: What are the different Ubuntu Kernel git tags for? Going through the Ubuntu Kernel git source there are several tags, the meaning of which I'm uncertain of.\nHow can I find out which tag is the one currently in the repos for each version of Ubuntu? Is it okay to compile the latest tagged versions of the kernel?\n\nA: In each Ubuntu Kernel Team git repository the Ubuntu-* tags represent the git commit which was used to build the official source package for any particular upload.  For instance in the ubuntu-precice git the tag Ubuntu-3.2.0-23.36 represents the 3.2.0-23.36 source upload.  Some tags have an additional -lts- component indicating they are the official LTS backport for the containing release, in the ubuntu-lucid git repository the tag Ubuntu-lts-3.0.0-18.31 represents the 3.0.0-18.31 oneiric LTS backport for lucid.  \nYou can use the Launchpad versions page for the linux package to determine the current versions uploaded into each pocket of each release:\nhttps://www.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux\n\nAll recent tags should be signed by the committer to prevent modification.  You should be safe to build any official tag and expect to get a substantially similar result to the uploaded binary packages for that release.\n", "Q: Error during device I/O when using USB scanner I have a Canon LIDE 100 scanner that doesn't properly initialize on first scan attempt. When I trigger a scan, it seems to start (you hear the scanner beginning to engage), but then my scanning application (gscan2pdf) echoes back: \"Error during device I/O.\" If I close the application, and restart another scan, there is no error and it scans properly.\nI get the same behavior if I use Simple Scan or XSane.\nThere are many other reports of this behavior, and others have suggested that my system has put the USB port to sleep (at least partially) to save power. It seems to not properly wake up. I'm using 10.10 and it has been suggested that I may be able to tell my system to not autosuspend the USB port, but am not sure how to do that.\nAny input on this is appreciated.\n\nA: Autosuspend of a USB port is possible through the laptop-mode-tools package.\nThe kernel could also play a part.\nlaptop-mode-tools\nIf you have this installed then there should be a file called /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/usb-autosuspend.conf.\nAssuming you have this file, examine the file.\nTwo possible settings you might want to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*CONTROL_USB_AUTOSUSPEND=\"auto\" - if you set this to 0 then auto-suspend is switched off for all USB devices.\n\n*Perhaps better - you can blacklist certain devices such as your scanner by adding its USB-ID to AUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST.  You can find your scanner id by running lsusb.  For example - AUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST=\"046d:c025\"\nKernel Boot option\nYou can force autosuspend to be switched off through the grub-boot option usbcore.autosuspend\nAdd usbcore.autosuspend=-1 to the value GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in the file /etc/default/grub.  Dont forget to run sudo update-grub afterwards.\n\nA: I was getting the same grief with a Canon MP260 for scanning on an HP Pavilion dm1 running Debian wheezy. Same error report in xsane and gscan2pdf. I had the scanner and some other devices connected via a small USB hub and thence to a USB port on the computer. All the grief disappeared when I moved the printer to connect directly to the computer.

I had been looking for a solution for some time! \nTwo things though (probably since that post is old from 2013):\n1) The same \"scanbuttond\" package file (scanbuttond_0.2.3.cvs20090713-14_i386.deb) is available now in the repositories, probably after installing the cited ppa:rolfbensch/sane-git, so there's no need to download it from the pkgs.com website, just type \"sudo apt-get install scanbuttond\".\n2) The actual button on the scanner does nothing when pressed so I'm not sure what the purpose of the \"scanbuttond\" software actually is, so probably it is not needed anyway if you don't mind missing this functionality. If the purpose of the software is just to have this physical button work then it doesn't though, at least in my case. I scanned through Easyscan, Xsane and gscan2pdf and all worked perfectly. I would recommend doing the \"Scanner config\" and \"Permissions\" sections in the reference article and checking if it works, if it doesn't then go to \"Install dependencies\" through the PPA and check again. At last I would install the scanbuttond and configure it.\nBy the way I got it running in a Panasonic Let’s note laptop and there where no usb port power saving issues here. I hope it helps.

This is especially true if you want your application to end up in the App-store.  A good explanation is given on another stackoverflow site here which ties together your Objective-C question and writing for the IPad.\nApple, unusually perhaps, have an excellent IDE and development tools which they give away for free.\nI would either buy a used Mac, or (if you have a license) - install a virtualised OS-X in VMWare etc.\nKDevelop does have some Objective C patches - but it doesnt look like it is actively supported.\n\nA: I do agree with @fossfreedom .

Is MeeGo more tuned for this kind of ultra-portable device, ie. cpu and battery life? My computing needs are modest, I usually run a terminal, text editor, and browser at the same time for web development, maybe some music playing as well.\nThe portability of this computer is attractive to me, but if I can't work on it, then it doesn't help me.\n\nA: Having used both I am sure that you will more than fine. You could always try the meego installation for a little first and then if you do not like it download Ubuntu and try that perhaps from a pen drive and see what you prefer.\nI have used both and they are both brilliant on a netbook. Ask perhaps yourself what you like about the Meego installation and then try the Ubuntu from a pen drive and see if there is any difference. \nMeego can have some issues with wifi and graphics cards just like Ubuntu but as it is preinstalled it will be fine but you may need to be aware of them prior to any upgrades you do as that can get tricksy afterwards if your wifi or graphics card drivers need updating too. That said that can also be the same in Ubuntu. You can look both on here\nMeego Netbook Forum\nand perhaps have a look at other sites and blogs to see what trouble and solutions people have with the hardware that is in this new Meego device. I did a Meego blog (check my profile for details) of common things I had to do.\nI have to say I was pleased to see a netbook release of meego on hardware and this looks like a nice model. \nI have no doubt that you will enjoy it and if you do not ...stick Ubuntu on. :)\n", "Q: Twitter app that supports real time updating Hi everyone i need a twitter client that fully integrates with the unity shell and is capable of providing real time updates for my mentions, direct messages etc when minimised    \n\nA: From your specifications, I recommend you to use Gwibber, which is default in 11.04. \n\nIntegration in Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Integrates with Message Indicator\n\n*Quicklists in the launcher.\n\n*Real time updating.  How*?   \n\nReal time updating?\nNot by seconds, the minimum is 5 minutes to refresh for tweets and mentions and replies, but seriously do you need it to be faster?It will bring headache:).  \nAnd tick show notifications for all messages.\nGo to edit ---> preferences ---> set the minimum to 5 minutes.\n\n\nNote: If you really need real time updating; you can use Tweetdeck for desktop, but you need first to install Adobe Air. But it lacks integration with Unity and Ubuntu in general.\n", "Q: Tesseract and OCRopus \n*\n\n*I was wondering what relations are between Tesseract and OCRopus?\nIs OCRopus a wrapper of Tesseract? Or are they now developing\nindependently?\n\n*What are some advantages of one over the other?\n\n\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: The only intra-relationship between the two OCR tools was that prior to v0.4 of OCRopus, it used Tesseract as its character recognition tool via a plugin.\nOCRopus has since replaced Tesseract with its own engine primarily for future capabilities such as additional languages and handwriting tools.  However you still have the option of using Tesseract.\nOCRopus is a full GUI based application.\nTesseract itself is a backend-engine - various front-end GUIs use Tesseracts' capabilities.  Thus you cannot directly compare the two.\nThe last major release of OCRopus was March 2010 - but it does have major plans for a future v0.5.  \nIn terms of activity - Google are reporting high developer activity for Tesseract whereas OCRopus is slower with a medium rating.\n", "Q: Unable to change preferences in Acroread v9.4.2 I can view the preferences but the selection boxes are all locked, as well as the Cancel and OK buttons.  The only option is to close it.\nHave tried uninstall/re-install acroread but situation persists.\nIs there some system settings that I need to change to unlock preferences?\n\nA: It seems it can be done, if you know how to use the keyboard. It's just the mouse that does not work in the Preferences window. For those who don't, you use tab to move between the sections, spacebar to select or deselect the checkboxes, and press enter a couple of times with the OK button selected. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: shortcuts to select text in terminal I was wondering if there are shortcuts for selecting some text in terminal, just similar to holding shift and type arrow key in editing a text file in a text editor. Thanks!\n\nA: A bit late for the party but yes there is a way.\n\n*\n\n*Replace the rodent with number pad navigation.\nSettings -> Universal Access -> Pointing & Clicking ->\nEnable Mouse Keys\nYou can now use the 4 to go left, 8 to go up, 5 to click etc. (make sure NumLock is OFF).\nNOTE: For this to work you need a NumberPad.\n\n\n*Moving the mouse with the number pad is going to be dog slow so lets fix that next. See man page for xkbset for details.\nsudo apt-get install xkbset\nxkbset ma 60 10 10 5 2\nNow you should be able to use the NumberPad to move your cursor at a reasonable speed, so move it to the terminal where you want to select the text.\n\n\n*To select the text in the terminal to the right of the pointer:\nCtrl+Shift+5+6\nThis is equivalent to mouse click=5, go right=6\nTo select to the right of the cursor:\nCtrl+Shift+5+4\n\nA: I'm assuming you are referring to Gnome Terminal.\nNo - there isnt a Copy and Paste mechanism using just the keyboard - you can use various short-cuts to paste (depending upon your Ubuntu version) i.e. CTRL+ Shift + Ins , Shift + Ins or CTRL+ Shift + V to paste text in the clipboard.\nHowever, if you type screen you enter the terminal emulator which allows you to select, copy and paste text using just the keyboard.\nTo select (copy): \nPress Ctrl + A together followed by Escape.  This puts you into Copy mode.\nUsing the cursor keys move to the beginning of the text you want to copy.  Press Enter.  Now move to the end of the text to be copied.  Press Enter.\nTo Paste:\nPress Ctrl + A together followed by ].\n\nA: In gnome-terminal running bash as default shell, you can hit c-x twice (c- same as ctrl-) to select the last typed text.\nRefer to bash reference for more.\n", "Q: What to do with extra video drivers? I have 11.04 installed, and was poking around and saw that I had more than my Intel Video Drivers installed. \nDo I need them?\nWhat is the best way to \"trim the fat\"? \n\nA: If you're referring to display drivers that come with xorg, for example\nxserver-xorg-video-apm\nxserver-xorg-video-ark\nxserver-xorg-video-ati\nxserver-xorg-video-ati-dbg\nxserver-xorg-video-chips\nxserver-xorg-video-cirrus\nxserver-xorg-video-displaylink\nxserver-xorg-video-dummy\nxserver-xorg-video-fbdev\n...\n\nYou can remove some of them with apt-get remove <driver_name> if you want to but I'd advise against it. They are there in case you happen to change your display adapter and they don't take up very much space.\nRemoving one of them also removes xserver-xorg-video-all which is the metapackage containing all the display drivers that come with xorg. This shouldn't cause any problems, but I'd still play it safe and leave it alone.\n", "Q: How to solve gtk-warning on using gedit? I'm new in using ubuntu. I got the following error for several lines after changed 'grub' in /etc/default\n(gedit:2996): Gtk-WARNING **: Attempting to store changes into `/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed: Failed to create file '/root/.local/share/recently-used.xbel.NXBRZV': No such file or directory\nDuring installation, I created 2 disk partition for ubuntu. One is swapspace. Another is for '/'.\nIs this a big issue? How to solve? Thx in advance\n\nA: Right. You're running gedit as root, and root has its home in /root. But since root isn't a normal user, it doesn't have the normal directories like /home/user/.local/share/. In your case, it means that it can't store the list of recently edited files for gedit. \nIt is of absolutely no importance. But if you want that warning to go away, you can type \"sudo mkdir /root/.local/share/\". That will also let you open files that root has recently edited in gedit. But everything is fine :)\n", "Q: keyboard layout switching on restart I have two keyboard layouts that I use, My default keyboard is an USA layout, with a secondary Slovenian layout. I use the Slovenian layout only when I need some special characters when writing emails and such.\nBut my problem is this: \nEvery time I reboot my computer, the layout indicator shows I am on the USA layout, but the actual keyboard layout is Slovenian. Then I normally have to switch from USA to Slovenian and back, to get the layout I want. \nIs there anything I can do about this? I don't restart my computer often, but when I do I forget about that, and typing the passwords like that doesn't work. \n\nA: Log out then before log back in select the Slovenian keyboard.\nNow you can reboot safely ;-)\n", "Q: Wacom Bamboo Pen scaling issues I recently purchased a Wacom Bamboo Pen. It worked out of the box with Ubuntu Natty Narwhal, but I'm annoyed with the fact that the tablet is proportional to the screen. This makes a little line on the tablet show up as a large line on my screen (I'm using xournal). Is there a way to make it so that there is no scaling between my screen and the tablet?\n\nA: To answer your question for future readers:\nYou want to use the xsetwacom program and place it in your .xinitrc file in your home folder. The setting you want to use is called 'stylus' and the value should be set to 'Area'. Like so:\nxsetwacom set stylus Area 0 0 1024 768\nxsetwacom set eraser Area 0 0 1024 768\n\nFor example will set the area that the stylus device works in to be within those co-ordinates. You may also be interested in the non absolute setting which allows a different way of working with the pen.\n\nA: Not sure whether you really want mouse mode, or perhaps pressure sensitive settings are what you are looking for.  Whatever the case, hope https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wacom helps.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Why does a command work from shell, but not from the applications menu? I'm trying to add a command to my applications menu:\n\nBut when I select it from the applications menu, it doesn't do anything.\nWhen I run that same command from the shell, however, it runs fine. Why?\n(Also, why does pycharm need sudo priviledges?)\n\nA: You should always use gksudo when you run graphical applications. Not only does it provide you with a prompt so you can enter your password, but it also uses some variables that are important. \nI have no idea why or if PyCharm requires root privileges. It's easier to provide a good answer if you provide more details. \n", "Q: Can you set the default remote desktop app to let your computer be viewed off your network? The remote desktop app when enabled doesn't work with computers outside your network.  Can you set it to let you do such?  If so how?  Is there a separate app that will let me do such a thing?\n\nA: That has nothing to do with the application. You have forward a port on the router to make the computer accessible from the internet. That aside, allowing VNC access outside the local network is a bad idea security wise.\n\nA: Assuming you have already installed vnc-viewer (e.g. from tightvncviewer ) you can connect to a remote outside your local network via an SSH connection by using the option -via\nvncviewer -via user@remote localhost:0\n\nThe display at localhost:<display<> depends on your local settings (usually 0).\nOf course you need to know the IP of the remote machine you want to connect to. If you have no static IP you need to use a dynamic DNS service (e.g. DynDNS) and run a client on the remote side that provides the IP to the service, e.g. in the router (recommended) or by running ddclient . \nAlso an SSH server needs to run on the remote machine (install openssh-server  on the remote machine).\n\nA: I think the easiest way to do this is teamviewer ( http://www.teamviewer.com/ ). This is what I started to use.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the \"bootstrapping instance\" in Juju? So I've recently played around with Juju, and I see quite a bit of potential. But there are a few things I don't exactly understand. Most notably, I'm not sure of the purpose of the \"bootstrapping instance\" (aka \"bootstrapping node\" or machine “0”).\nUsing the example from the user tutorial:\n$ bin/juju status\nmachines:\n  0: {dns-name: ec2-50-16-61-111.compute-1.amazonaws.com, instance-id: i-2a702745}\n  1: {dns-name: ec2-50-16-117-185.compute-1.amazonaws.com, instance-id: i-227e294d}\n  2: {dns-name: ec2-184-72-156-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com, instance-id: i-9c7e29f3}\nservices:\n  mysql:\n    formula: local:mysql-11\n    relations: {}\n    units:\n      mysql/0:\n        machine: 1\n        relations: {}\n        state: started\n  wordpress:\n    formula: local:wordpress-29\n    relations: {}\n    units:\n      wordpress/0:\n        machine: 2\n        relations: {}\n        state: started\n\nMachine 1 is the mysql instance, and machine 2 is the wordpress instance. What exactly is machine 0 up to?\n\nA: The bootstrap instance runs two critical pieces of the infrastructure: Zookeeper and the provisioning agent. Here is the architecture overview:\n\nRight now this is actually a single point of failure.. though that will be solved in the near term by expanding the \"bootstrap\" service to 2 units either on demand, or in response to deploying a second machine. Luckily, Zookeeper is designed for high availability and the provision agent will use Zookeeper for coordination so its not a complex problem to solve, just one that needs to be solved before Juju is ready for real production usage.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop and restart a Juju deployment? I would have thought that juju shutdown would move the instances in the deployment from \"running\" to \"stopped.\" Instead it actually terminates all instances. Are juju deployments inherently ephemeral? Is there any way to stop and restart an juju deployment?\n\nA: The short answers are, \"no\" and \"no\".\nThe shutdown command has always made me a little nervous, because of the finality of these terminations. The default AMI's used are for EBS instances, so you can at least snapshot all the instances before the shutdown, but I don't think there's an easy way to then start new instances with these EBS volumes just yet. I do think that it would be useful to have the ability to stop / start services or the whole deployment.\nWe've talked about having various options for saving and restoring the data before/after shutdown, which is related to your question. I'd suggest renewing this discussion on the Juju mailing list, which is more appropriate for development discussions:\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/juju\n", "Q: How to change partitioning - may involve conversion of a partition from primary to extended I am having trouble thinking through how I can achieve my partitioning goals.\nNow my partitions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 (winA) (primary)\n\n*sda2 (winB) (primary)\n\n*sda3 (/ for ubuntu) (primary)\n\n\nWhat I want to migrate into is (obviously partition numbers need not be exactly like that)\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 (winA) (primary)\n\n*sda2 (winB) (primary)\n\n*sda3 (/boot) (primary)\n\n*sda4 - extended which will contain\n\n*\n\n*sda5 (/home)\n\n*sda6 (/ for ubuntu)\n\n*sda7 (swap)\n\n\n\nI know I may be asking too much, but what would a way to do it?\nOne way I have thought is\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new primary partition for /boot and split it from the root partition into the new one. It shouldn't be too hard. Then the disk will have 4 primary partitions.\n\n*Somehow convert the root ubuntu partition from primary to extended.\n\n*Split that last partition in 3 extended partitions (root, /home, swap) and split the contents there.\n\n\nI am obviously stuck on the 2nd part.\nAnother way could be (maybe easier):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an extended partition (or two)\n\n*Split /home there\n\n*Somehow move everything except /boot to the extended partition. This way /boot will stay on the primary partition that exists now, and will be shrunk as needed, and everything else will end up to the extended partitions.\n\n\nThis may sound better, but I'm not too sure how to do the 3rd part.\nSome details:\nThe disk is almost empty, so I have space to move things around in it, shrink the ubuntu partition etc.\nI don't want to touch the windows partitions in any way. \nReinstallation is not an option. \nAlso using a different partitioning scheme with fewer partitions is not an option (for example not having a separate /boot)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: OP has solved the problem and posted as a comment,\n\nI have solved the issue already, using the second method I described\n  in my question. Everything went fine\n\n\nA: You cannot have more than 3 primary partitions on a hard disk.  It is not very clear why you will move the boot partition? Do you want install a dual boot?  You can download Gpartd Cd - and do the things you want to do. You find an excellent documentation here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition .\n", "Q: Change remote desktop permissions from the command line (remotely?) I can ssh into my desktop at work and work at the command line, but I would like to use a remote desktop protocol to check on some of the programs that I left open and running.\nI have not set up permission to use a remote desktop client (e.g. tsclient) on the desktop, so my requests to connect are refused (see picture).\n\nThe instructions given in a previous question suggest that the following should work:\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true\n/usr/lib/vino/vino-server\n\nBut I get this:\n(30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Autoprobing TCP port in (all) network interface\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Listening IPv6://[::]:5900\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Listening IPv4://0.0.0.0:5900\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Autoprobing selected port 5900\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Advertising security type: 'TLS' (18)\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Advertising authentication type: 'No Authentication' (1)\n30/07/2011 11:25:35 PM Advertising security type: 'No Authentication' (1)\n\nAm I doing something incorrectly?\nIs it possible to ssh in and give myself the required permissions to use tsclient?\n\nA: Provided you have setup your ssh server and client to accept X-forwarding we can start the Vino Preferences Manager by the following command:\nssh -X <remote>\nuser@remote:~$ vino-preferences\n\nBy this we can enable the vino server, and change settings including VNC password.\n\nA: You're not doing anything wrong, but you're doing it using the wrong software. Quite understandable. What was called \"remote desktop\" in Ubuntu was never intended to be a remote desktop solution. It was intended to be a way to share your running desktop with someone else. I filed a bug and it seems to have been fixed because it's now been renamed to \"Desktop sharing\", which is a far better description. \nBut even if it was possible, it would not be recommendable. VNC is a very slow protocol and there are far better alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*XRDP is a remote desktop protocol server for X. It is poorly documented and it's somewhat complicated to configure. The benefit is that you can then use the remote desktop client in Windows to connect to it, as well as the tsclient that is installed by default in Ubuntu. http://www.xrdp.org/\n\n*Nomachine NX. This is a very efficient and easy to use remote desktop system. It is closed source, built on their own open source NX libraries. They provide a server you can use free of charge if only two users should be allowed to connect and it's limited to two connections at a time. They do sell other services without these limitations. Their client is free of charge and available for several operating systems. They also have a java plugin so you can launch sessions from a web browser. There is an open source client called OpenNX that is compatible with their server, but I haven't tried it myself. Nomachine: http://www.nomachine.com/ OpenNX: http://opennx.net/\n\n*FreeNX aims to be a direct replacement of Nomachine NX Server, based on the open source NX libraries. It is compatible with their client and the OpenNX client. It's easy to install and use. http://freenx.berlios.de/\n\n*X2Go. This is my favorite. It is based on Nomachines NX libraries and their server is open source. They have a plugin for Firefox that enables you to run a session directly in the browser. They also have support for PulseAudio, which the others do not. Their client is very good and can be used as a display manager. http://www.x2go.org/\nThey're all very good solutions, but I would recommend that you try them in the reverse order and stop when you find one that works well. That is, x2go first, then freenx, etc. \n\nA: You can also install x11vnx and run it after logging in via ssh. \nBut I will first try solution proposed by Takkat. In most cases it will work out of the box.\n", "Q: Eclipse PDT plugin gives me trouble Editor of PDT plugin jumbles the code and doesn't take responses in. I tried many things but didn't help at all.

Gnome-screenshot 3.1.2 uses filenames like this one \n\nScreenshot at 2011-07-31 12:13:04.png\n\nmaking it rather easy to see when it was taken.\nThe problem is that it uses the colon ( : ) character - making it impossible to access such an image from Windows.\nConsidering I take most of my screenshots so I can send them to Windows users this has caused some problems.\nIs there any way to change the default name that is used by the screenshot tool to replace the \":\" with \".\" or \",\" ?\n\nA: There is a simple and dirty way to rename all the screenshot taken immediately after the creation, but you will need to install inotify-tools  ( apt-get install inotify-tools ) and then you could run this command:\nwhile true; do inotifywait -e CREATE ~/Pictures && rename 's/\\:/\\./g' Pictures/Screenshot*.png; done;\n\nWhile this command will run, every time you save a new screenshot in Pictures/, the script will rename every file containing :, substituting : with .\n(Maybe you want change the directory, I don't know which directory Gnome 3 uses)\nIf you really like it, you can start this command in a script every time gnome starts.\n\nA: Instead of installing additional software and writing this code in the screenshot tool, here's a workaround to rename the files afterwards.\nAll you need to do is to navigate to the directory and run the following command\nrename 's/\\:/\\-/g' *.png\n\nThis will replace all colons with dashes in all file names ending in .png of the ones present in the current directory.\n\nA: Shutter is another application for taking screenshots which allows you to customize the file name: you can install it from Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: It is not actually possible change it easily, maybe you can help with this bug report.\n(for the curious, check the source code. Currently, relevant line is 134)\nUpdate: The bug was fixed upstream on 2015-01-28, replacing colons with dashes, which helps.  But they didn't take the space out unfortunately.\n\nA: \ngnome-screenshot doesn't allow setting a global default for the screenshot filenames, but you can use the -f option to specify a filename on the commandline.\nWe can use that to write a small bash script that will take the place of the original gnome-screenshot binary and will execute the original with the correct filename parameter.\nNote that you will have to have root privileges for the following operations, so prefix each command with sudo or open a root shell with sudo -i.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the original gnome-screenshot binary out of the way:\ndpkg-divert --add --rename --divert /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot.real /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot\n\n\n*Open /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot in an editor (you should see a new empty file):\neditor /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot\n\n\n*Paste the following two lines into the editor:\n#!/bin/bash  \ngnome-screenshot.real -f \"$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots/$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S).png\" $@\n\nYou can insert any path you like after the -f; just make sure to enclose it in quotation marks and to keep the $@ after it.\nIn this example, the screenshots will be stored with filenames like /home/yourusername/Pictures/Screenshots/2011-07-31_12-13-04.png. See man date for details on the date +%… syntax.\n\n*Save the file and close the editor (e.g. using Ctrl + X in Nano or :wq in Vim).\n\n*Make the newly created script executable:\nchmod a+x /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot\n\n\nA: If:\n\n\n*\n\n*you are familiar with binary editing tools such as bless(see ubuntu package for example or github),\n\n*and you know C string format modifiers,\n\n*and you know the difference between 0x0 and \"0\",\n\n*and you do not mind messing around with binary files installed by your Linux distribution of choice,\n\n\nthen you can modify the file name that is used by gnome-screenshot.\nWhen binary editing gnome-screenshot, you will find two format strings:\n\n\n*\n\n*%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S followed by a null byte,\n\n*and Screenshot from %s.%s followed by a null byte.\n\n\nIn the second format string, the first %s is the date, the second %s is the file extension.\nFrom here, you can, for example, overwrite %Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S with %F-%H%M%S followed by a null byte and Screenshot from %s.%s by shot %s.%s followed by a null byte: screenshots will then be named \"shot 2018-05-05_174857.png\" for example.\nAdapt to your preferences.\nThere are two constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*the new date format and the new file name format must not be longer than the original ones,\n\n*your customizations will be destroyed if you install a new version of gnome-screenshot, for example when updating your system.\n\n\nWarnings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, your mileage may vary.\n\n*This is a hack, not a clean way of modifying the default name generated by gnome-screenshot: make a backup before proceeding.\n\n*Posted without any warranty of any kind.\n\n\nA: In Debian 8.6 KDE → System settings → Custom shortcuts, I have set Trigger → PrtScn, and Action → \ngnome-screenshot -p -f \"$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S)_D.png\"\n\nand it works fine.\n\nA: Here's mine.  I expanded on n.st's answer.  \nCreate a shell script to call gnome-screenshot\nSave this to the file: /usr/bin/area_screenshot\nYou may need to use sudo.  So use vi to create it. \nsudo vi /usr/bin/area_screenshot\nCopy the code below into it.  \n#!/bin/bash\n\nscreenshot_dir=\"$HOME/Documents/screenshot\"\ncurrent_year_dir=\"$screenshot_dir/$(date +%Y)\"\ncurrent_month_dir=\"$current_year_dir/$(date +%Y_%m)\"\nfileout=\"$current_month_dir/$(date +%Y_%m%d_%H%M%S).png\"\n\n# Step 1: Check for screenshot directory \n[ -d \"$screenshot_dir\" ] || mkdir \"$screenshot_dir\"\n\n# Step 2: Check year and month directory\n[ -d \"$current_year_dir\" ] || mkdir \"$current_year_dir\"\n[ -d \"$current_month_dir\" ] || mkdir \"$current_month_dir\"\n\n# Step 3: Take area screenshot, and save to the current month \n[ -d \"$current_month_dir\" ] && /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot -a -f \"$fileout\" $@\n\nThen, mark the file as executable. \nchmod ugo+x /usr/bin/area_screenshot\nThen, in your keyboard shortcuts, set area_screenshot to the Printscreen button.  You will need to create a custom shortcut for this (maybe someone else can link an example to do this).  \nWhat does this do? \nIt will create a screenshot at HOME/Documents/YEAR/YEAR_MONTH/filex.png.  \nWhere filex.png is in the format YYYY_MMDD_HHMMSS.png.  So for example, 2019_1220_121314.png.  \nHow is this helpful?\nI find this technique is quite useful to take screenshots of comments and articles.  Over time, I capture a lot, so it's very convenient to get it automatically categorized into subfolders.  Then over the years, they keep accumulating, and the year subfolder keeps it nicely organized.  I tend to put the current month in my favorites link (in Windows), and manually update it every month, as I usually only need to look at the current month.   \nIt would be great if Ubuntu, Fedora, etc., made something like this as the standard on Linux.  Please take my code example, and make it so!  It would help everyone by keeping their screenshots nicely organized.  \n\nA: To expand on this answer that applies to Debian, this pertains to Ubuntu 20.04 \"Focal Fossa\":\nI set a custom keyboard shortcut to be:\ngnome-screenshot [--flags] --file=file:///home/User/Pictures/Screenshots/$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S).jpg\n\n(If you are copying this, replace User with your own username.)\n--flags could be any of the options. You can learn more about gnome-screenshot from this guide.\nI set the shortcut to be triggered with the PRINT SCR button and it works like a charm for me now.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete every hidden folder in the home directory? My $HOME (otherwise known as '~') directory has lots of hidden configuration folders.\nIs it safe to delete all of them?\nTo be specific\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the OS break if I do so?\n\n*Will my ethernet/printer/sound/graphics drivers stop working?\n\n*I don't care about superficial things like: Gnome themes, Key shortcuts, Font settings, etc\n\n\nA: It is NOT safe to delete them. I want to give you an idea why so I did a quick check on my home folder and here are a some reasons why for me it would not be safe (And make me cry a river really):\n\n\n*\n\n*They contain configuration files. It is known that some of them can recreate themselves but if you changed or customized an application, the change will be gone.\n\n*For the .local and .cache folder, you are talking about multiple configuration and downloaded cache packages. This involves having to download several megabytes if not gigabytes of information again  or having to reinstall some apps again (if they manage to give an error about not reading the configuration file)\n\n*For very big apps like WINE which happens to hide itself in .wine in the home folder, killing it, well, that is like formatting your whole windows drive. You have just removed everything about wine and any windows app you happened to install. In my case we are talking about 6 apps that come to 23GB of information. Imagine if somebody installed 10 games, microsoft office, photoshop and some other apps and then deleted all of that. Heart attack approaching.\n\n*If you have the XBMC folder in there which is .xbmc. I know several people including me will cry over the fact that they have to download ALL the content again for the movies and video series. That is about 12 hours worth of work assuming the internet connection does not drop.\n\n*The .mozilla folder is there. Your configuration and addon information will be lost.\n\n*Do you use several SSH sites. Well not anymore. You need to configure them again. This could be read as a security problem if you do this on a company.\n\n*Were you pimping you gimp with better addons. Not anymore, the config got deleted.\n\n*Did yo happen to have a personalized Terminal window (like the bash and profile hidden files). Nope, you did not, since your configuration file got deleted.\n\n*Not all hidden elements are folder. There are several hidden file that are used very often like the bash and profile files, the history file and logs.\nAnd to top it off, apart from the obvious Reboot you have to do, there is not 100% way to be sure that everything will come back working correctly. Maybe for a just installed system, but for somebody that for example has had those hidden folders and files since 4 Ubuntu versions ago, one problem can become big very quickly.\nNow for you question, will drivers stop working. No they will not. they will still work after cleaning up.\nWill the OS break. It depends. If a running service has a configuration in there, you might get a problem there. If a RC customized file has a file in there, you will have a problem. For a common user that just installed the system, there will be no problem at all, but give it a year with several programs installed and customized stuff. you might regret having to delete all of that.\n\nA: The short answer is yes, it can be dangerous and it will have detrimental effect on your use of the system, even if the system itself won't be affected. That is to say, other users will continue as if nothing had happened, even if your user account will be useless.\nSome of the dotfiles are created when the user account is first created, meaning that it will not be recreated automatically. Lots and lots of applications depend on them, meaning that those applications will not work properly. Many applications are totally dependent on configurations. If they aren't available and cannot be created, then the application will be useless and may crash or refuse to run. \nIt would be similar to deleting the registry in Windows, but worse since dotfiles in Ubuntu not only holds configuration, but also holds personal data. Your databases are stored in ~/.local/share/desktop-couch/ for instance. If you are synced with Ubuntu One, then deleting that folder might also delete those databases from all other computers, including the web. \nIf you had provided more details about why you would want to do this, then it would be easier to give an exact answer. But if for some reason you really do want to do this, then I think this is the way you should do it: (please be sure you want to)\nOnly perform these steps if your home directory is not encrypted. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary user named \"tempuser\" for instance. \n\n*Add that user to the admin group just in case. \n\n*Log out of all desktop sessions\n\n*Switch to another console by pressing alt+ctrl+f1\n\n*Log in with the temporary user\n\n*Rename your old home directory (something like mv /home/bob /home/bob.bak)\n\n*Create a new home directory for yourself\n\n*Set the right permissions on it. \n\n\nNow you have a clean system for your user, just as when you logged in for the first time. You can start to copy files from the old home directory into the new one. Don't \"cut\" or move. That way you'll have the old home directory as backup if something goes wrong. Please pay attention to what you're doing. If you're logged into Ubuntu One, for instance and you replace the files that contain information about synchronized files and folders, then Ubuntu One will notice that those files are no longer available. To it, that means you have deleted them and it will synchronize those deletions across your network, meaning it will delete all those files from all your computers and on the web. \nSo make sure you know what every file is and what every file does. And in any case, do make a backup. There are good chances you will do something you didn't intend to do, or that something you intended to do had side-effects you didn't know about.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your reasons are valid\n\n*Take a backup first (I'm not joking)\n\n*Pay close attention to what you're doing\n\n*Write down everything you do so you can learn from your potential mistakes.\n\n\nA: I've just tested it and removed everything in my /home/test directory. I was then able to login through terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and graphically too.\nWhy would you want to do that is another question. If you want to remove a user account, do it from Users and Groups or similar settings manager. \n\nA: I checked out (Ubuntu 12.04 only): In a fresh user or superuser account there are only three configuration files:\n.bashrc\n.profile\n.bash_logout\n\nSo, the account should behave like a new one, if all hidden files are deleted except these three.\n(Of course, all documents, local programs or local configurations saved in the hidden folders will be lost then. And the deletion should be done after logout from another superuser account. For further details, see the other answers.)\n\nA: You should be relatively safe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Surely your OS won't break, dot files in home directory are mostly configuration files, if they're not there any app will just use the defaults.\n\n*Device drivers (as ethernet,video,sound,...) should be configured systemwide, so you should be safe.\n\n*Those are the things will \"break\" as all your preferences/customizations will get lost, but you don't care ;)\n\n\nIn fact if you add another user to the system his home directory will be mostly empty, apart from some default files which are put inside by default. But those defaults are distro-specific and surely not mandatory.\nSo yes, you should be quite safe deleting everything under home.\nJust in case, play safe and move them to another directory and check everything is ok before deleting them.\n", "Q: Can anyone recommend Apache2 indicator for gnome panel I just re-install my Ubuntu and forgot name of Apache2 service indicator, it's a green button at start and red at stop..\n\nA: Perhaps you're referring to apache-switch?\nIt's quite easy though to do it by hand:  \nsudo service apache2 (start|stop|restart)\n", "Q: How do I stop the unity side bar from apearing when I try to drag & drop?

I just bought a Lenovo x121e (E-350 version).\nI was able to successfully install ubuntu 11.04 and everything is running fine (for the system to boot an efi partition seems to be necessary however). \nThe laptop has a Seagate Disk with a physical sector size of 4096 bytes. \nAfter ubuntu is installed Disk Utility reports that my partitions are not properly aligned:\n\nI have tried both fully automatic install wiping the disk (as shown on the screenshot) and setting the partions manually during install. Both variants show misaligned partitions. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this this a bug when creating the partitions or is Disk utility giving wrong information?\n\n*If the alignment is wrong and negatively affecting performance, how can I correct it (either now or with a fresh install)?\n\n\nA: I own the TP X121e (AMD E 350), too and ran into the same results that you reported.\nI found a workaround. It requires a fresh install, although there might be alternatives that don't require this -- well, I haven't tried anything, but at least the following works:\nA useful prerequisite was the article http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-4kb-sector-disks/ and especially the first comment posted by JLockard on 19 November 2010.\nMy TP X121e has a 320GB Seagate Harddrive that uses a physical sector size of 4096byte and a logical sector size of 512byte and that's where the misalignment comes from (see mentioned article).\nI haven't found any way to correctly align partitions to the 4096byte scheme neither with disk utility nor with gparted (there's an \"align to MiB\" option in gparted but that resulted in misaligned partitions, too).\nSo I reverted to the command line and used parted (that's the solution the commenter JLockard mentions, see above). And that's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I booted from my ubuntu-live-usb-flashdrive and used gparted to set up a gpt partition table (that should be possible from command line with parted, too, but I didn't want to dive any deeper in the man pages).\n\n*Then I switched to command line and set up the partitions with parted: parted -a optimal /dev/sda\nThe -a optimal option stands for optimal alignment and that's the thing we need. The command starts an interactive mode where you can just type in the following commands:u MiBUnits to align to should be Mebibytespshowed me that the harddrive is 305245MiBs largemkpart primary 1 20 Later on, that will be my efi boot partition (an efi partition is required to boot into ubuntu at all, as you correctly pointed out) later on (roughly 20MB, as the automatic ubuntu installation suggested in my earlier installation attempts).mkpart primary 20 25020That will be a 25000MiB / partition.mkpart logical 25020 297245 will be my 272225MiB /home partition. The rest of available space will be my swap partition (roughly 8GB -> 8GB RAM):mkpart logical 297245 100%Before proceeding, one can check if alignment is correct with align-check optimal N where N is the partition number.\n\n*Then I started the Ubuntu installer again and chose the \"something different\"/manual install option. Now I assigned the filesystems and mount points to the previously created partitions (1=efi-boot, 2=ext4 /, 3=ext4 /home, 4=swap). Disc utility shows a 1MB free space before the first partition and a ~375KB free space behind swap. That's due to the optimal alignment. \n\n*Installation went on... and: Nicely --or better: optimally-- aligned partitions! I don't know if that really made any difference but at least my system \"feels\" a little snappier.\nAny suggestions for improvement appreciated.\nMy suggestion for Ubuntu: The disc utility of the installer should get a gui option that sets the optimal alignment for 4096byte-drives. That would be the easiest solution.\n", "Q: Lenovo Thinkpad W520 cpufreq frequency scaling not working For some reason my processor always seems to run on full speed even if I don't do anything.

Why is that? I have a 64 bit processor on my Thinkpad W520, but I just installed the 32-bit Ubuntu (Natty). I'm afraid that if I don't go along with the  \"recommended\" 32-bit version, I'll have hardware driver problems. Am I just being paranoid?\n\nA: It appears that the recommendation is to install the safest and most compatible version.  There are some programs and even some hardware that work best - or even only - with the 32-bit version, although these are few and becoming fewer.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu for the first time a few months ago, I followed the recommendation, too, and so got the 32-bit version.  After awhile I got to wondering if I could have installed the 64-bit version, so I downloaded and installed it.  I found the 64-bit version to be just a bit faster and everything ran on it, so I've stayed with it.\nHowever, I also found that one piece of hardware, the Linksys AE1000 access point, did not have a 64-bit driver and the 32-bit driver would not work with it.  For me it was no problem, as I had an ethernet connection on my desktop and didn't need the wireless access point (I had installed it with the 32-bit version just to see if I could get it to work).  But if I had been using a laptop that needed that particular hardware, I would've had to go back to the 32-bit Ubuntu.  So I would suggest trying the 64-bit Ubuntu, but don't delete the 32-bit version until you're sure the 64-bit works.\n\nA: That has nothing to do with paranoia. You can use the 32bit version on a 64bit computer, but you cannot use the 64bit version on a 32bit computer. That makes 32bit a \"safer\" choice and unless you have more than 4GB RAM, the 32bit version will be fine. In the past, the 32bit version would also provide better Flash and some other things, but I don't think that's currently an issue. \nIt is very unlikely that you will have any driver issues with the 64bit version, although it is theoretically possible if you are dependent on weird, proprietary drivers.\n", "Q: Why is kauth gone from heimdal-clients, and is there something to replace it with?

I took another stab at this and finally found the solution, which is quite ridiculous: kauth is now more or less replaced by kinit, one can now auth with kinit. \n", "Q: Which is the correct GnuPG executable to use to configure Enigmail?

In February last year, I built a new PC from parts.  Fast foward 16 months, and I'm repeatedly cleaning malware infections from Windows 7.  I decided to try Ubuntu on my PC.\nMy PC has hardware raid.  The hardware raid has two 500 GB disks set up with RAID-1 mirroring.  I have a 100GB partition with Windows 7 and a 400GB unformatted partition.\nHowever, when I try to install Ubuntu 11.04, on the \"Allocate drive space\" screen, it shows only the 100GB partition with Windows 7.  It's as if the 400GB partition doesn't exist.  BTW, the Windows 7 partition is labelled /dev/sda.  The logical drives for Windows 7 are /dev/mapper/pdc_bbifbfdfdi and /dev/mapper/pdc_bbifbfdfdi2\nWhat do I need to do in order to install Ubuntu on my 400GB partition?\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu onto a RAID device it may not work as expected or at all when using the standard installation.\nYou will have to download the alternate ubuntu installation iso and burn that iso to an actual cd/dvd disc.\nI tried installing it through a USB onto a RAID0(stripe) but it didn't work for some reason; it got to the end and just died... So it seems to only work if booting from an actual cd/dvd disc.\nScroll to the bottom and you will find links to both 32(i386) and 64(amd64) bit installations.

I am pretty much just a newbie,so please help me out.\n\nA: Instead of adding /dev/sda10/ubuntu /home ext4 nodev,nosuid 0 2 to your /etc/fstab you can add these two lines:\n/dev/sda10 /all-homes ext4 nodev,nosuid 0 2\n/all-homes  /home none bind 0 0\n\nYou need to make the directory with sudo mkdir /all-homes and be sure that there is no other fstab entry that mounts in /home\nThe bind type in fstab (and as an mount option) makes the kernel \"mirror\" one folder in to an other and it seems to me that what just what you wanted (btw this approach should work on all modern linux's, as far as I remember from kernel version 2.6 and forward..)\n", "Q: php not working under directory of mod_userdir (~/user) My php code not working under directory of mod_userdir (~/user) but working fine at /var/www/ , how I can dealing with this problems ? when I open  a php file under ~/user my browser prompt to download\n\nA: Please look in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf, it has this comment:\n# To re-enable php in user directories comment the following lines\n# (from <IfModule ...> to </IfModule>.)

I'm trying to install Alacarte and the dependencies are huge, basically all of GNOME. I know that they are unnecessary. Is there an option in Synaptic or an apt-get flag for this? \n\nA: The key option to add to apt-get is --no-install-recommends\nSo for alacarte - \nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends alacarte\n\nGiven that alacarte is default in standard Ubuntu, can I ask what variant of Ubuntu are you installing alacarte for?\nIf you are using Xubuntu or Lubuntu - can I recommend an alternative menu editor from the answer to this question.  I've found that alacarte doesnt work with both Lubuntu and Xubuntu.\n\nA: You can download the .deb package (apt-get download foo) and install it via dpkg using the --force-depends option.\n\nA: There are two kinds of dependencies for alacarte: “depends” and “recommends”.\nAlacarte depends on Python and various Python libraries (which in turn pull in some libraries); the “depends” level says that alacarte won't work without these. APT-based tools won't let you install alacarte without those dependencies. You can ignore all dependencies with dpkg --force-depends, however this will confuse APT when alacarte is involved in a dependency calculation later (for example when a newer version of the package appears), hence doing this is not recommended. Furthermore it's unlikely that you'll get any use of the package without these dependencies.\nAlacarte depends on gnome-panel (which in turns depends on many other parts of Gnome) at the “recommends” level. This indicates that alacarte is rarely useful without gnome-panel, but can be in some circumstances. Here, alacarte is indeed useful without gnome-panel if you have a different Freedesktop-compliant menu application.\nBy default, apt-get install installs all dependencies at the “depends” or “recommends” level. Pass the --no-install-recommends option to tell it not to install “recommends”-level dependencies. You can make this the default setting by adding APT::Install-Recommends \"false\"; to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/zzz_mpmcfarlane.\nWith aptitude on the command line, pass -R or --without-recommends to avoid installing “recommends”-level dependencies. In the Aptitude full-screen UI, marking alacarte for installation also selects gnome-panel, but you can unmark it before proceeding with the installation. The APT preference also influences aptitude.\nIn Synaptic, marking alacarte for installation also selects gnome-panel. However you can go and unmark gnome-panel before applying the changes. There is a preference (in the “General” tab) to “Consider recommended packages as dependencies”.\n", "Q: Master volume versus application volume I just got Ubuntu 10.10 a few days ago on a new desktop and for the first few days the volume worked as expected.  However, now the master volume seems to impact nothing.  When I am playing Rhythmbox, for example, I have to open up the sound preferences in order to change the sound for an individual application.\nIs there any way to get the master volume setting back to where it was, able to control all the applications instead of them ignoring it?\n\nA: Perhaps you have more than one audio device? It isn't uncommon for the VGA to have HDMI audio output, for instance and I have experienced situations where the master volume control is set to control another device. \nIn the preferences dialog, there is a page called Output. If the correct device is selected, try to select another one and then back to the one you want to use and see if that helps. \n\nA: I have tried that, with every possible permutation of options, eventually I just updated to 11.04 and now the problem is gone, so I can only assume that I had a bad update.\n", "Q: How safe is it to use the \"ubuntu+1\"? How safe is it to have a system like that - always on \"ubuntu+1\" (or Debian sid, for that matter)?\n\nA: That's a bad idea unless the main goal is to work on developing Ubuntu -- in which case it is a very good idea. I installed Oneiric on my desktop a couple of days ago, and I was unable to get a login screen. I was able to get the desktop up in failsafe X (800x600) once, but not twice. What is safe about using Ubuntu alphas, is betting that it will break. \nThis cycle has been particularly bumpy though, because of fairly massive changes in the underlying technologies. But I suspect it will begin to settle soon. For me, alpha 3 has been an interesting time to start testing, but it all depends on what kind of breakages you're comfortable with. Obviously, there is nothing wrong with running it in parallel for a while so you can see for yourself. Once you get a good feeling for it, you can make an informed decision about how early you want to upgrade. \n\nA: I have tested Alpha/Beta releases since 10.04 and I have to tell you that, even though 12.10 is still in Beta (Today Beta 2 will come out), I am really amazed at the fact that, even in Beta stage, it works perfect. There are minor details and apport will pop up to tell you about them but all in general, it feels like everything is in place.\nI should mention this is the first time for me that a Beta release has worked great. I still have nightmares over 11.10 or below. Even Beta versions of 12.04 had very bad problems, but right now, after testing it in 3 PCs I don't even notice the fact that it is still Beta because it works great.\nBut aside from my experience, since this IS a Beta version, it would depend on your hardware and how you will use Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it it be for a production system (VERY bad idea to use a Beta)\n\n*will it be for your home system (Remember to backup everything you charish)\n\n*will it be for testing it (By all means do it).\n\n\nSo it depends on your usage as an end user and not so much for the features it brings (Even though they are eye candy to see, kernel panics are not if you get one)\nWhat I recommend is to wait for the final release. IF you still want to try it out, then there is the ISO/Torrent image to download and use it as a LiveCD/LiveUSB. That way you will have an idea of how it will behave on your PC.\n\nA: Well first I recommend doing an sudo apt-get update followed by a sudo apt-get upgrade of the 12.10 version. That should take care of having the system up to date.\nThen do the command you mention in your question and yes, update manager will appear saying:\nHey dude! Ubuntu 13.04 is available. Would you like to take the blue pill or the red pill\n\nIf you upgrade to 13.04, it will download around 700 MB and upgrade/remove/install a lot of stuff. After a reboot you should have 13.04 running on your system. For the question whether it is safe or not we need to remember this is an Development version, which means is not ready yet. I am testing it right now since in Google Plus I was following a couple of Ubuntu developers and one of them was testing it saying it was working perfectly. I got curious and went ahead.\nI have to say, this is the first version I have tried where, if I get an error, it goes back to 12.10 so I can correct the problem (In my case it was the Nvidia drivers). That was the only problem. After that, I am writing to you right now from 13.04 which is running much better than even the stable 12.10. Note that this is NOT FOR PRODUCTION, nor it should substitute the STABLE VERSION. If you upgrade to it, you are just simply testing the 13.04 which your current hardware and checking how the progress is doing.\nI upgraded 2 of my PCs with no problems at all. I even went psycho on 13.04 and added the PPA for Xorg Edge and other very bleeding edge PPAs (I have latest xorg with latest nvidia card.. and am scared!!). Nothing apart from the repositories going wild has happened.\nSo.. is it safe?. Depends totally on your hardware and what package errors you get on the upgrade process (Only 1 in my case as I said before). If you know how to use the terminal and several commands of Ubuntu and you are not a beginner with Ubuntu, then by all means, take it for a test drive. If not, hold on and wait for the final 13.04 release.\n\nA: \nIf you do not care about being unable to boot to desktop, if you\n  aren't afraid of being forced to manually fix the X server, if you do\n  not have any data you cannot easily restore in case it was totally\n  erased, if you feel adventurous enough to be affected by tons of bugs\n  still present in Quantal, if you can stand serious crashes from time to\n  time, then do upgrade to ubuntu+1.\n\n(well, seriously, some people, including me, enjoy the above.)\nIf you want to contribute and write some code to help working on, for example, Unity, then do upgrade.\nRemember - alpha and beta software is by its nature will contain bugs.  Only upgrade if you are content with helping out finding and reporting bugs.\nAlso remember that downgrading back to a stable release isn't trivial:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version?\nOtherwise stick with the official release schedule and install when the stable release is available.\n\nA: I'm a bit of a rebel and I installed Ubuntu 12.04 Alpha 1 and I have not had any issues with the stability from day 1, so my guess is that Beta 1 is going to be a rock... \nBut honestly, living on the edge if you have critical data on your computer is not the best idea in the world.  \nI'd say install the stable release of Ubuntu 11.10, and just wait for 6 weeks for the stable release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS \n\nA: It all depends when you upgrade.  Alpha 1 is often highly unstable and I'm told not many developers run it on their main machines.  Beta 1 is pretty usable if you're prepared to work on some bugs.  After the final beta, it's very nearly as stable as the final release.\n", "Q: Creating synaptics entry in xorg.conf cases X to not start Ubuntu 11.04 doesn't seem to have an entry for my Synaptics Touchpad xorg.conf file by default.\nAs soon as I create\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier  \"Synaptics Touchpad\"\n    Driver  \"synaptics\"\nEndSection\n\nthen GDM fails to start at all.\nWhat is the propery way for me to enter an option for my Synaptics touchpad in xorg.conf?\n\nA: Actually, a Related Questions link answered my question:\nxorg.conf in ubuntu Natty 11.04\nI just added the settings I wanted to the existing file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf, and it worked. :)\n", "Q: Can I run Gnome 3 in Classic Desktop and still switch to default Unity?

The line that got added in the fstab file is this\nUUID=xxx     /      ext4    errors=remount-ro    0    1\n\nShouldn't there be a 'defaults' in there?\nI've bumped into this while trying to move the home folder to a different partition. I've done it, and everything is working fine. I've added only errors=remount-ro in the fstab line for /home.\nNow I'm in the process of 'securing' it, and choosing those options more wisely (like adding nodev and nosuid). So, do I need to add 'defaults' or not? Why is it not added?\nWhich specific options are the 'defaults' anyway in Natty Narwhal?\nDo I need to add\nUUID=xxx /home ext4 nodev,nosuid,errors=remount-ro 0 2\n\nor\nUUID=xxx /home ext4 defaults,nodev,nosuid,error=remount-ro 0 2\n\nor something else? \nAlso, I've seen that relatime is in the defaults for Natty Narwhal. But are the defaults running if there is no mention of the defaults keyword in fstab and the 'mount' output?\n\nA: As per man mount (if you use the option defaults):\n   defaults\n          Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.\n\nWhen you use contradicting options (like defaults,noexec), the later will take precedence.\nIf you don't state any options, the default options in Ubuntu are rw,relatime.\n", "Q: How to setup a cdrom drive in Wine Okay, so I installed Wine, and installed the first StarCraft, but when I try to run it, it tells me that the cd isn't in the cdrom drive (but it's already in there) and asks me to insert it.\nSo, I did some searching, and I found out that I need to setup a cdrom drive in Wine, but when I autodetect for drives, it doesn't find the cdrom drive (it does show drive D, but it doesn't say that it's a cdrom drive). So, does anyone know how I can find/setup a cdrom drive? Thanks!\n\nA: Set wine to see /media/wincd as its cd drive then with the iso file in you home folder run in terminal:\nsudo mkdir /media/wincd\nsudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 $HOME/mygame.iso /media/wincd\nsudo ln -s $HOME/mygame.iso $HOME/.wine/dosdevices/d::\n\nThe mkdir command ensures the /media/wincd folder is present to mount the iso.\nChange mygame.iso to the name of your iso file.\nChange d:: at the end of the second command to a different letter with two colons if the cd is not drive d.\n\nA: I just solved this myself (installed StarCraft under Wine) and I ran into the same issue.  Here are my notes for how to install and run StarCraft (from a legitimate original CD-ROM) on Ubuntu 20.04 under Wine.\nFirst, I dislike relying on the CD-ROM itself, as it may get scratched or damaged, so the first step I took was to copy the CD-ROM into an ISO file.  (Saves wear and tear; the CD-ROM itself stays on my shelf now.)\nsudo cat /dev/sr0 > ~/starcraft.iso\n\nOnce this command completes (which takes a while), the CD-ROM can be removed.  Next, create a mountpoint and mount the ISO file.  I did this with the following in /etc/fstab:\n/usr/local/games/disks/starcraft.iso /usr/local/games/mnt/StarCraft iso9660 loop,ro 0 0\n\nFollowed by sudo mount /usr/local/games/mnt/StarCraft.\nAt this point is when I ran the setup.exe file in that directory, which allowed me to install StarCraft (using the code on the original CD-ROM case).  That worked fine, but then clicking \"Play StarCraft\" showed the error:\n\nStarcraft is unable to read a required file. Your Starcraft CD may not be in the CDROM drive. Please ensure that the Starcraft disc is in the CDROM drive and press OK. To leave the program, press Exit.\n\nI found an ars technica thread which gave the solution, which I'm quoting here in case of link rot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run 'winecfg'.\n\n*Click on the 'Drives' tab.\nThe existing drives are 'C:' ('~/.wine/') and 'Z:' (the Linux root -- '/').\n\n*Click the 'Add' button to add a new drive.\n(The new drive will be called 'D:' since it is after 'C:'.)\n\n*In the 'Path:' field, enter the mountpoint of your CDROM drive, where the Starcraft CD will be mounted. Typically, this would be '/cdrom/'.\n\n*Click 'OK' to exit winecfg.\n\n*Mount your Starcraft CD at '/cdrom/' if you have not already done so.\n\n*Run Starcraft.\n\n\n(In my case, in step 4, I entered /usr/local/games/mnt/StarCraft.)\n", "Q: Sound not working and on-board audio seems to not be present I have built a computer with a Gigabyte P67A-UD3-B3 motherboard.

These machines depend on a small directory of MATLAB scripts in /usr/local/MATLAB/... in order to properly read data from a serial device.\nI would like to be able to maintain this bit of code on Launchpad so that I could easily package this MATLAB script directory into a PPA and thus, easily maintain all of the computers in the lab...\nSo, I guess this could also be a Debain/Launchpad question, but -shrugs-.\nI'm ready to upload the code to Launchpad and setup a ./debian directory... My question would be, what is the best way to package this simple directory of scripts so that it can work with Launchpad's auto-package system? Seems like there are a number of ways to do this? What's the best way to handle the debian directory? What's the best way to skin the cat?\nI have experience doing this with other source code, and have maintained other projects through Launchpad. But never done anything as simple as \"just put this directory into '/usr/local/MATLAB'. I also realize that I would not be able to put MATLAB as a dependence of this package of custom scripts.\nDoes this make sense?\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: You can follow the documentation in Debian New Maintainer's Guide: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html (chapter 4).\nAlso, take a look at the package anarchism for insight:\napt-get source anarchism\n\nwhose ./debian directory contents should very closely follow what your project needs. Making necessary changes or rolling your own control, copyright, changelog and rules is sufficient for building a debian package (issue dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot).\n\nA: You could run a local repo and when you update the package on your PPA etc it will be marked as an update on your servers, downloaded and installed\n", "Q: xmodmap periodic resets on Xubuntu I'm running Xubuntu 11.04 and i'm using a KeyOvation mac compatible Gold Touch keyboard.

This works well by installing it using apt:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-source\n\nFirst, get the JDK, then install the JDK sources (for some reason they are not included in the JDK). This worked for 11.04 and 10.04 LTS... maybe it's possible for you to give OpenJDK a try - it's the future anyway.\n\nA: Not sure what's wrong with the installer, but I've always installed the sun jvm by hand. It's not too hard, really .\nThe jvm (or jvms, there can be multiple ones on your system, especially after upgrades) on ubuntu end up in /usr/lib/jvm. Usually the actual jvm lives in a folder in /usr/lib/jvm, your java & javac executables are softlinks from something like /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/java/somejdk.version.blah.blah.blah. \nSo: \n\n\n*\n\n*download the correct jvm for your hardware, expand it and put it in /usr/lib/jvm (e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.026)\n\n*softlink /usr/lib/jvm/jdk -> /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.026 (that way, if you want to swap jvm's later, this is the only link you have to change.\n\n*point the links your os is using for java (/usr/bin/java) ->to /usr/lib/jvm/jdk/bin/java\n\n*if you've got any environment variables floating around to JAVA_HOME make sure they point to the jdk directory.\nmostly you'll just need java & javac, but there's a fair number of other binaries probably linked in /etc/alternatives that are not used to much, (jhat, jmap, ... ) that's probably better to clean. \n\nA: I use the latest sun jdk to install in ubuntu. I don't know where it went wrong in your installation process above. If you want you can install it manually as i did in my case. I have written blog for that which i myself consult whenever i forget.I think it might help you.\nThe link is : http://manoharbhattarai.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/install-java-manually-in-ubuntu-linux/\n", "Q: How do I log in and access Ubuntu One? I know it sounds like a dumb question, and problems should be addressed in the FAQ or the forum. But Ubuntu One seems to resist all attempts to actually log in and access its services.\nRecap of what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created an Ubuntu One account a long time ago, and I'd like to be able to access it.\n\n*If I go the sign in or sign up link at the ubuntu one page, a blank page loads. Nothing happens.\n\n*I re-installed Ubuntu 10.04 a short while ago. My choice of desktop environment is KDE. I did find this page online. But when I follow the instructions, my installation of apt can't find the repository.\n\n*I found a page for another client, KDE client for Ubuntu One, \nbut this product seems to be in early alpha, and it was released a long time ago.\n\n*I fired up nautilus, but poking around, I can't seem to find a way to connect to an Ubuntu-One account.\n\n*I fired up gnome-panel, and opened up the preferences for Ubuntu One.  When I click on manage account, I get a blank page. \n\n*Looking at Ubuntu One's FAQ, I see that there is an article addressing problems logging in via the Gnome Ubuntu One Preferences Manager, so I tried to follow the instuctions. It instructs to open the 'password and encryption keys' manager from the gnome panel, and make changes to Ubuntu One settings. The entry I'm supposed to change is absent.\nSo, how do I actually access my account? Preferrably from KDE?\n\nA: The best way to use Ubuntu One from KDE at this point, is probably to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu One control panel is now based on Qt.\n\n*The code is split up a bit better, and should be installable without requiring most of GNOME as it did before.\n\n*The programs have had many performance improvements, as well as bug fixes.\n\n\nThe new ubuntu-sso-client used by Ubuntu One now, should work with the new KWallet API in newer versions of KDE as well. It uses the Freedesktop Secrets API to talk to the keyring. However, if KWallet doesn't support everything that ubuntu-sso-client uses yet, then gnome-keyring will still be required. You can install that package, and ensure that gnome-keyring-daemon is getting started when you log in, and the environment variables it sets, are exported to the applications in KDE. You can check that by running env | grep GNOME_KEYRING inside a terminal.\nOnce that's set up, you should be able to launch ubuntuone-control-panel-qt, and click the Sign me in with an existing account button to log in with your current account.\nHowever, if you simply get a blank page when logging in on the web site, you may want to file a support request at https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ so that the support team can check your account is not having issues.\n", "Q: How do I add a slider to an AppIndicator?

How to do it? /home is in a seperate parition with '/home` folders of other distros as well? I need to backup them all before i do anything else.\n\nA: If you boot an Ubuntu live session, then the home partition will be shown in Nautilus, so you can just click to mount it. Then you can copy the folders elsewhere like you do with any other folder.\n", "Q: What file is the package description in? I am wanting to fix a typo in a package description, however I don't know how to access this information. I can see it using the apt-cache show  command, but where does the package manager actually get this info? I have scoured the source thinking it might pick it up from a config, or man but no dice.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The package description is taken from the file debian/control in the source package, which contains various metadata about the package including name, version and description. For example, if you wanted to access the description for the coreutils package, you could do:\n$ apt-get source coreutils\n\nto download the source package into the current directory (and unpack it), then:\n$ vi coreutils-8.5/debian/control\n\nto view and edit the package control file.\n", "Q: How can I tell which driver my system is using?

It refers to the kernel, which is a very small, but highly important part of Ubuntu. When you install a new kernel upgrade, the old one is not removed. The reason for this is that the kernel is a critical component, and if something goes wrong with it, you might not be able to boot and fix any problems. Considering the vast amount of different hardware out there, it is not impossible that something might break with a new kernel, and if it does, you will be able to simply choose \"previous linux\" and boot the Linux that didn't have any problems. \nLinux itself doesn't use much diskspace, only a few megabytes, so I wouldn't worry about it. \n\nA: If you want to get rid of unnecessarily files, you'll need to install from scratch. It's really the only way. The bootloader entry isn't actually an issue as jo-erlend describes.\n", "Q: How to install Gnome3 in future versions of Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install and use the latest version of GNOME 3? \n\nIn Natty you can install Gnome 3 via a PPA.\nFor future versions such as Ubuntu 11.10, how would I install Gnome 3?\n\nA: \"Gnome 3\" is often confused with \"gnome-shell\".  \nTrying to simplify, Gnome 3 is basically the \n\n\n*\n\n*Graphical User Interface (GUI) called gnome-shell \n\n*a number of key applications and \n\n*an extensive set of underlying libraries of code for the above.  \n\n\nFuture versions of Ubuntu will use many of the key applications and the vast majority of underlying libraries of code. The remaining \"Gnome 3\" applications from above can be installed via Software Center.\nThus, this just leaves the GUI from the list above.  From Ubuntu 11.10 onwards, the default GUIs available will be Unity-3D and Unity-2D.  Assuming you need the GUI \"gnome-shell\", this is available to be installed through the Repositories as well.  \nThere is a package in Software Center (or synaptic manager - if installed) called gnome-shell.  \nInstall that and it will be available in your sessions menu to be selected when you next logon.\nAt the time of writing, 11.10 (oneiric) is in alpha.  A number of issues relating to integrating gnome-shell exists.

After reboot shows error, something like \"error on line 1 on symbol 1\" or kind of that. With open-source drivers everything were fine, but with catalyst external monitor works only in mirror mode. \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: If you're using a Radeon HD5xxx or newer, then I would suggest you use the open driver. AMD has people working full time on it and in my experience, it's already much faster and more stable than the proprietary one. So without knowing why you installed the proprietary driver in the first place, I would say the answer is to uninstall Catalyst. \nOnly AMD can fix problems with the proprietary drivers.

I am very new to Ubuntu and I still don't understand a lot of basic concepts so please bear with me.\nI successfully installed XAMPP 1.7.4  in my ubuntu 11.04. The XAMPP is installed in /opt/lampp. I know how to write php file in /opt/lampp/htdocs using the bash terminal command sudo gedit /opt/lampp/htdocs/myphpfile.php but what if I already have an existing php file inside a folder? Of course I don't want to write it again using sudo command. All I want to do is copy that folder that contains the php files inside htdocs like I always do in Windows WAMP. Is there a command in which I could set the /opt folder to writeable? Please help me.\n\nA: You can also use open nautilus (file browser) as root and type \ngksudo nautilus /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\nThis will open your file explorer.  You can then go to the folder you want to copy the php files from and paste it into the htdocs folder. \nHope this helps! :)\n\nA: You could always open up the file-browser (nautilus) as Arvind said by gksudo nautilus /opt/lampp/htdocs\nTo expand on Will's answer (you can chmod)\nThis will change the ownership of the /opt/lampp/htdocs/ to you:\nsudo chown username:groupname /opt/lampp/htdocs\nExample : (My username is nits and my group name is also nits)\nsudo chown nits:nits /opt/lampp htdocs\n\nThis will change the folder's permissions to be read, write and executed by you ONLY:\nsudo chmod 700 /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\n\nA: Linux has tighter permission system, /opt folder is really an admin only area, and that's why it asked you password all the time. where windows just \"assume\" you are admin\nTo copy paste without sudo, you will need to use the chmod to change the permission.\nI would recommend you type man chmod to read the manual there. try avoid 777.\nBeside You better make regular backup as there is no \"re-cycle bin\" in Linux. if you somehow overwrite a critical file with empty one, it's most likely gone forever.\n\nA: You do not want to change ownership of /opt or even /opt/lampp. These directories are owned by root for a reason:  security . If you go down the path of changing ownership of directories away from root, you are making your system less safe and may open yourself up to serious problems.\nThe best way to do what you're trying to do is to use a solution similar to what someone here already suggested: use the gksudo command. However, because it's tedious to constantly open a terminal to type the full command, create a shell (.sh) file instead.\n1) Open a text editor (something like gedit, leafpad, kate, etc.) and type in the following:\ngksudo nautilus /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\n2) Save the file on your Desktop as htdocs_open.sh\n3) Open the terminal and type the following (this will change directories to the Desktop, where the above file, htdocs_open.sh, is saved.):\ncd Desktop\n\n4) The type in the following (this will make your .sh file executable):\nchmod +x htdocs_open.sh\n\n5) Close your terminal and then look for your file, htdocs_open.sh, on your desktop. Double click on it. A window will pop-up asking for your password. When you type it in the xampp htdocs folder will open along with root privileges. \nAdditional note! Since you are using Xampp on Linux, it might be convienient for you to also repeat the above steps using these codes:\nTo start Xampp:\ngksudo /opt/lampp lampp start\n\nTo stop Xampp:\ngksudo /opt/lampp lampp stop\n\nTo open a text editor (gedit is used here) as root. This will allow you to save to the htdocs folder because opening gedit as root means you can save into the htdocs folder as root.\ngksudo gedit\n\nRemember! You will need to make the .sh file executable by running the chmod +x command.\n\nA: I was having this problem myself, and then I realized I can do just one thing and everything will be flowers and roses every time from now on.\nI opened nautilus. Then browsed to /opt/lampp/htdocs.\nThen I changed the owner and group to myself, and then I provided the read and write privileges to everyone. However when I tried to do it for the files somehow it was returning back to - instead of Read and write however. This worked. And now I can modify the files stored in htdocs.\n\nA: I used this:\nsudo chown username:groupname /opt/lampp/htdocs\nsudo chown username:groupname /opt/lampp/htdocs/*\nsudo chown username:groupname /opt/lampp/htdocs/*/*\nsudo chown username:groupname /opt/lampp/htdocs/*/*/*\n...\n\nBut owner of every new created file/folder will be root.\n", "Q: Changed files are not recognised on mounted drive I have ubuntu 11 server installed as a virual machine using vmware fusion.

The grep command works, but I don't know how to use it for every directory (I can only do it for my current directory). I tried reading man grep, but it didn't yield any help.\n\nA: It would be better to use \ngrep -rl \"string\" /path\n\nwhere \n\n\n*\n\n*-r (or --recursive) option is used to traverse also all sub-directories of /path, whereas \n\n*-l (or --files-with-matches) option is used to only print filenames of matching files, and not the matching lines (this could also improve the speed, given that grep stop reading a file at first match with this option).\n\n\nA: The command rgrep is dedicated for such need\nIf not available, you can get it like this\nmkdir -p ~/bin\ncd ~/bin\nwget http://sdjf.esmartdesign.com/files/rgrep\nchmod +x rgrep\n\nYou can directly set into your default grep options as described above.\nI personnaly use\n[[  ${#args} -lt 5 && \"${args//[[:space:]]/}\" == \"-i\" ]] && args=\"-Hin\"\nargs=\"${args:--Hns} --color=auto\"\n\nrelated topic : how to always use rgrep with color\n\nA: grep (GNU or BSD)\nYou can use grep tool to search recursively the current folder with -r parameter, like:\ngrep -r \"pattern\" .\n\nNote: -r - Recursively search subdirectories.\nTo search within specific files, you can use a globbing syntax such as:\ngrep \"class foo\" **/*.c\n\nNote: By using globbing option (**), it scans all the files recursively with specific extension or pattern. To enable this syntax, run: shopt -s globstar. You may also use **/*.* for all files (excluding hidden and without extension) or any other pattern.\nIf you've the error that your argument is too long, consider narrowing down your search, or use find syntax instead such as:\nfind . -name \"*.php\" -execdir grep -nH --color=auto foo {} ';'\n\nAlternatively use ripgrep.\nripgrep\nIf you're working on larger projects or big files, you should use ripgrep instead, like:\nrg \"pattern\" .\n\nCheckout the docs, installation steps or source code on the GitHub project page.\nIt's much quicker than any other tool like GNU/BSD grep, ucg, ag, sift, ack, pt or similar, since it is built on top of Rust's regex engine which uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal optimizations to make searching very fast.\nIt supports ignore patterns specified in .gitignore files, so a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns simultaneously.\n\nYou can use the common parameters such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*-i - Insensitive searching.\n\n*-I - Ignore the binary files.\n\n*-w - Search for the whole words (in opposite of partial word matching).\n\n*-n - Show the line of your match.\n\n*-C/--context (e.g. -C5) - Increases context, so you see the surrounding code .\n\n*--color=auto - Mark up the matching text.\n\n*-H - Displays filename where the text is found.\n\n*-c - Displays count of matching lines. Can be combined with -H.\n\n\nA: I believe you can use something like this:\nfind /path -type f -exec grep -l \"string\" {} \\;\n\nExplanation from comments\nfind is a command that lets you find files and other objects like directories and links in subdirectories of a given path. If you don't specify a mask that filesnames should meet, it enumerates all directory objects.\n\n\n*\n\n*-type f specifies that it should process only files, not directories etc. \n\n*-exec grep specifies that for every found file, it should run the grep command, passing its filename as an argument to it, by replacing {} with the filename\n\n\nA: My default command is\ngrep -Rin string *\n\nI use a capitol 'R' because ls uses it for recursive. Since grep accepts both, no reason to not use it.\nEDIT: per HVNSweeting, apparently -R will follow symlinks where as -r will not.\n\nA: If you're looking for lines matching in files, my favorite command is:\ngrep -Hrn 'search term' path/to/files\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-H causes the filename to be printed (implied when multiple files are searched)\n\n*-r does a recursive search\n\n*-n causes the line number to be printed\n\n\npath/to/files can be . to search in the current directory\nFurther options that I find very useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*-I ignore binary files (complement: -a treat all files as text)\n\n*-F treat search term as a literal, not a regular expression\n\n*-i do a case-insensitive search\n\n*--color=always to force colors even when piping through less. To make less support colors, you need to use the -r option:\ngrep -Hrn search . | less -r\n\n\n*--exclude-dir=dir useful for excluding directories like .svn and .git.\n\n\n\n\nA: I do this using xargs, a very underrated command\nfind ./ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep 'string_you_are_looking_for'\n\nfind ./ gives you a recursive list of all the files in a current folder\nthen you pipe it to xargs that executes the grep command on each one of those files\n\nA: Update 2:\nThis line of commands using find and grep fixes the problem:\n$ find path_to_search_in -type f -exec grep -in searchString {} 2> /dev/null +\n\n--color=<always or auto> for colored output:\n$ find path_to_search_in -type f \\\n            -exec grep --color=always -in searchString {} 2>/dev/null +\n\nExample:\n$ find /tmp/test/ -type f -exec grep --color=auto -in \"Search string\" {} 2>/dev/null +\n\nAn example run in the snapshot below:\n\n\nUpdate 1:\nYou can try following code; as a function in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases or in a script:\n\nwherein () \n{ \n    for i in $(find \"$1\" -type f 2> /dev/null);\n    do\n        if grep --color=auto -i \"$2\" \"$i\" 2> /dev/null; then\n            echo -e \"\\033[0;32mFound in: $i \\033[0m\\n\";\n        fi;\n    done\n}\n\n\nUsage: wherein /path/to/search/in/ searchkeyword\nexample:\n$ wherein ~/Documents/ \"hello world\"\n\n(Note: As suggested in the comments below by @enzotib, this doesn't work with file/directories including spaces in their names.)\n\nOriginal post\nTo search for the string and output just that line with the search string: \n$ for i in $(find /path/of/target/directory -type f); do \\\n    grep -i \"the string to look for\" \"$i\"; done\n\ne.g.:\n$ for i in $(find /usr/share/applications -type f); \\\n    do grep -i \"web browser\" \"$i\"; done\n\nTo display filename containing the search string:\n$ for i in $(find /path/of/target/directory -type f); do \\\n    if grep -i \"the string to look for\" \"$i\" > /dev/null; then echo \"$i\"; fi; done;\n\ne.g.:\n$ for i in $(find /usr/share/applications -type f); \\\n    do if grep -i \"web browser\" \"$i\" > /dev/null; then echo \"$i\"; \\\n    fi; done;\n\n\nA: If you’re willing to try something new, give ack a shot.

For example you can find files 1 MB large and containing something:\nfind . -type f -exec grep --quiet string_to_look_for {} ';' -size 1M -print\n\nFor multiple requirements you probably want to use the optimizer flag -O that exists in GNU grep.\n\nA: A script (find-in-code) to search in C, CPP code:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nfind . \\( -iname \"*.c\" -o -iname \"*.cpp\" -o -iname \"*.h\" \\) -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep --color -n \"$1\"\n\nUse:\nfind-in-code \"search string\"\n\n\nA: There is a very fast alternative to grep called the Platinum Searcher.

After that, I realized it was a big mistake. I'm also running Ubuntu along side windows7 (dual boot). Since I changed those permissions, I had to re install Ubuntu because I was not able to use sudoers. Is my windows 7 OS affected by the command I executed?\n\nA: Windows 7 is not affected by any changes you make on a Linux filesystem. In fact, Windows doesn't even know they exist. \n\nA: Windows 7 and Ubuntu are generally installed in a dual boot configuration as separate individual partitions.  When you are working on Windows 7, the linux files are not affected.  Subsequently, using Linux will not affect Windows 7.  Even if Windows 7 were mounted in teh Linux environment, it would not be affected in the least because it was not in the /etc folder which you modified.  Read my comment to your original question for important info, though, because you shouldn't be modifying global permissions in /etc like you did.\n\nA: In any case, I will always say that whatever you do about reinstalling Ubuntu or fixing an OS, the first thing to do is a full backup or all your data on all partitions, even if you know that you will not touch Windows partitions. Better safe than sorry.\nInstalling Ubuntu over an existing Ubuntu installation will not hurt Windows a bit. Linux is a multi-boot-friendly operating system and installing it will only redo its own partition and rewrite the boot sector to include all operating systems found on the disk, be it Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, etc. Windows will not even notice that Linux was changed or reinstalled. \nThe same thing cannot be said if you reinstall Windows. Windows, when re-installed will only \"scan\" for existing Windows XX installations and will include those under the NT boot menu. This will override the boot sector, and all Linux partitions will be unavailable, although untouched. There are well-documented pages on how to restore Linux booting.\n", "Q: How I can get Unity interface on MS Windows system? I have Ubuntu installed as primary system on my computer. So, I'm pretty used to the Unity, mainly indicators and dash, launcher is set on always visible in Compiz settings, and I'm waiting till somebody figures out how to get it to bottom of the screen as I would prefer it this way, but I'm fine with how it is now, I think the gobal menu should be selectable feature, and through Other tip I had changed the position of window buttons. It also has significant eye-candy. However, I'm forced to have Windows XP and 7 system installed alongside, as Wine API isn't advanced enough to run some applications without open-source alternative, and, mainly, games my relatives play, at the time of asking (11/8). So, when I have to use Windows, I'm quite lost. However, if I had Unity also on both Windows system, it would improve consistency, and I could use what I know from Ubuntu as my primary system! My relatives also admire Unity, so, it would definitively help me. Thanks!\n\nA: It isn't possible. Appindicators are platform independent, though, so you could implement a panel for Windows that supported them, and then applications using them would just work. But that is a fair amount of work. \nPerhaps it might be possible to port Unity-2D to Windows, but I don't think there's any proposal or will to do that. \n", "Q: Upgrade ATI Catalyst Control Center Twice now an upgrade of the proprietary ATI Catalyst driver has been a major pain, even with the help of excellent guides.\nThese commands all run successfully (as in $? -eq 0):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev* \\\nxorg-driver-fglrx\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper \\\ndebconf libstdc++6 dkms libqtgui4 wget execstack libelfg0 \\\ndh-modaliases # Already installed\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs # Ditto\nsudo sh ./ati-driver-installer-11-7-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/natty\nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\n\nAfter a restart it crashed during the graphical boot phase.

Where can I find the changelog between versions of the kernel released for Ubuntu 10.04?  Note that I need to find the changelog for 10.04 from an 11.04 system, so if I have to, I can run a VM for this purpose.\n\"Why do  I need the kernel changelog?\" you may ask.  I need it because I'm going to package a custom build of the kernel for myself onto a PPA I own, and I need the changelog to show my changes to the kernel in addition to all previous changes done by the Ubuntu developers.\n\nA: You could also add the relevant repos for lucid (it will not harm your system, given that the packages have older version number, so are ignored in dist-upgrade), update the cache and use the command\napt-get changelog linux-image-$version\n\n\nA: The latest version of the kernel for Ubuntu can be seen on Launchpad. See all current changelogs here: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux/\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+changelog\nThat should tell you what changed in each release.\nGiven that your main aim is to build your own kernel packages though, you might be better off following these guides:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\n\nA: I find http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges to be more human readable for each Major Kernel change (2.6.31, 2.6.32... 2.6.39)\nFor individual kernel versions i normally go here: \nhttp://kernelnewbies.org/Linux26Changes\nWhich shows in a more human readable way what is new, improved or fixed in each kernel version release.\nNOTE: Not related to specific Ubuntu kernel releases but as help for kernel news for future Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: @enzotib's answer didn't work for me, but one of the packages which include the kernel version is bound to get the correct report.\nYou can use this to figure out which one works:\n$ dpkg -l | awk \"\\$2 ~ /$(uname -r)/ { print \\$2 }\" | xargs -n1 -t apt changelog \n\nAnd in my case all except linux-image-${version}-generic worked.\n$ dpkg -l | awk \"\\$2 ~ /$(uname -r)/ { print \\$2 }\" \nlinux-headers-5.0.0-23-generic\nlinux-image-5.0.0-23-generic\nlinux-modules-5.0.0-23-generic\nlinux-modules-extra-5.0.0-23-generic\n\nE.g., apt changelog linux-headers-5.0.0-23-generic.\n", "Q: how to restore windows bootloader that doesn't let windows boot after ubuntu 11.04 installation? I installed Ubuntu 10.10 and chose the option of installation \"alongside windows\". Then I chose a drive where Windows 7, 64 bit was already installed. This drive had a capacity of 150GB. Ubuntu divided it into 100+50. I went along with that and installed Ubuntu 10.10 successfully. While booting windows 7 loader shows in the boot screen, but it does not boot after selecting the option and pressing enter. No error message is given, the screen just gets black and goes back to the operating system choice menu. Now i upgraded Ubuntu to 11.04.\nI have Windows 7, 64 bit and Wiindows 7, 32 bit in two separate drives of mine. Windows 7, 64 bit is on the primary partition, while the 32 bit version is installed on an extended partition.\nI want to keep all the three operating systems. Please suggest me the best way to keep tem.\nI have already tried Windows 7's start up repair. But no gain. I also rebuild boot using testdisk.\n\nA: Try this-\nFollow the solution here. Once you get that working, you can boot into a ubuntu livecd and reinstall grub.\n\nA: May guess is, that you corrupted Windows' bootloader. When you told Ubuntu to use the 150GB partition in chunks of 100GB and 50GB it might be that the disk was formated. \n", "Q: Ubuntu One Music Store Match service? Does the Ubuntu One team plan to incorporate a service like iTunes Match into the Ubuntu One Music Store?\n\nA: There's actually no need. \nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/services/music/\nStream your music, just ask them to make a web app and I think that'd be it! I don't think Canonical could afford the licences in which Apple can afford for the match service anyway.\n", "Q: How to copy themes? I tried to do something similar to this:\nHow can I install 10.10's Light Themes in 10.04?\nI installed the updated .deb, and then I took the /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/* from a 11.04 machine and put it in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance-Natty/* on my 10.04 machine.\nFor some reason the copying changed a bunch of permissions, and even changed the file name index.theme to Ambiance.desktop or something.

This hasn't happened for me with earlier versions of Ubuntu. It's pretty annoying, because this often causes the package list reloading to take quite some time.\nWhen reloading the packages with aptitude, the situation is similar: There, it doesn't \"fail\", but it prints [IGNORED] for each of them.\nThere's no special \"Translations\" entry in my /etc/apt/sources.list.\nScreenshot:\n\nMy /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates main restricted\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty universe\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates universe\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty multiverse\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty multiverse\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates multiverse\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates multiverse\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security main restricted\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security universe\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security multiverse\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-security multiverse\n\ndeb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu natty partner\ndeb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu natty partner\n\ndeb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu natty main\ndeb-src http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu natty main\n\n\nA: I think this is normal, as it happened to me every time I update the package lists.

Nautilus properties offer the choices Never, Local files only and Always for generating previews for files. \nHow does it decide what is a local file, and what is not?\nWhat I'm trying to do is get more detailed control over what folders get thumbnails/previews generated. Is there some config file I can change to get more detailed control over this?\n\nA: Local files are the files actually on your discs.\nNautilus can also show files from filesystems available through the GVFS system. This includes (but is probably not limited to):\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP sites\n\n*(Windows) Samba shares\n\n*OBEX protocol (Cellphones)\n\n*HTTP servers \n\n*WebDAV servers \n\n*SFTP servers\n\n\nThose are all not local files since the files them self reside on someone else's system. \nChanging if preview should be shown for specific files is done on an extension or mine type based method through the command gsettings. \n\ndisable all thumbnails\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.thumbnailers disable-all true\n\n\nDisable PDFs\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.thumbnailers disable \"['application/pdf']\"\n\n(in early versions of Ubuntu when gsettings was introduced Nautilus did not abide these though). The manual method of turning thumbnails off would then be rm -r ~/.thumbnails && ln -s /dev/null .thumbnails \nJust in case you are interested (but side stepping the answer): there is someone that made Gloobus Preview and it seems to have a bit more options. \n\nGloobus preview is an quick file previewer which supports many formats and preview them instantly. Currently it works better with nautilus and also with marlin file browser but many people don't use other file manager except nautilus.\n\nIt uses (/can use) gnome-sushi for thumbnails and this seems to generate them quicker than the how Nautilus does. Gnome-sushi seems to be installable seperate too (see the link).\n(I did not test either of these programs though)\n", "Q: Combine cabal and checkinstall Suppose I have a program which I can install via cabal, for example\ncabal install pandoc\n\nIs it possible to use checkinstall to make a .deb package out of this and install it in a second step via dpkg?\n\nA: There seems to be a program called \"cabal-debian\" that converts a cabal file into a debian package (ala checkinstall) and allows you to install it via apt/dpkg. It's provided by the package \"haskell-debian-utils\". The manpage & description for it can be found at http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/cabal-debian.1.html.\nLooks like running \"cabal-debian --debianize --ghc\", then \"dpkg -i\" whatever debs come out will achieve what you want.\n", "Q: will using xubuntu decrease my power usage? I am battling with the absurd power usage of ubuntu 11.04. On windows 7 (which came preinstalled) I can get around 4:30 hours turning everything off (wifi, bluetooth, lowest brightness for screen) with same settings I get 2 hours with ubuntu. I was wondering if I install xubuntu will that help me reduce my power usage?\n\nA: Yes, but not on that scale.\nTo change your kernel to something that will increase your batter life, you need to use the kernel that is in the Proposed updates repository. For more on how to enable that, look here.\n\nA: Yes, but almost definitely it wouldn't increase AC work hours by two times. Xubuntu has less tools and apps, and more optimized to be used in older, less powerful computers.\n\nA: I don't think this is Ubuntu's fault. Battery life on a computer decreases over time. Ubuntu isn't going to steal two hours of battery life, I know this because I have a netbook which gets the same battery life as it did when it was running Windows XP. It is currently running Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I set up the permissions on an automounted USB drive in 11.04 Under 10.04 it was possible to use the gconf-editor system/storage setting to specify the default permissions for vfat and ntfs file systems when a USB drive was mounted. That seems to be missing in 11.04 in gconf-editor and dconf-editor. The automount gives no permissions to other users and groups to access the files and programs such as MediaTomb can not access files on a USB drive unless I format it in ext3. \nHow can I change the permissions at or after mounting - any change does not seem to be sticky on a ntfs or fat32 USB drive.\n\nA: NTFS and FAT do not store permissions, so they are faked, making it look like you ( the person logged into the console ) own and can access the files, but not other users.  If you add an entry to /etc/fstab, you can specify the umask option and set whatever permissions you want.\n\nA: you should edit the /etc/fstab file and create a specific line for the device you want, more info can be found here: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html\n", "Q: Error in a gconf .entries file breaks my package manager I probably was out of my mind , i tried editing the \n\n/usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries\n\nfile by hand , i messed up and finally whenever i try to install/remove anything i am getting a huge error msg like this one Please help i swear i won't do it again \nReading package lists...

Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nEDIT :  I tried re-installing gnome-panel-data as suggested by Lekensteyn but  the error is still there ,probably the file is not the culprit  what is going on here ? \n\nA: Reinstalling the package would do in most cases.\nFirst, determine the package which is responsible for that file:\ndpkg -S /usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries\n\nOutputs:\ngnome-panel-data: /usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries\n\nTo reinstall it:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-panel-data\n\nAs for \"i swear i won't do it again\", we're not your parents nor your boss, so you can surely do it again ;) Be sure not to break it then.\nIf installation failed, try extracting the file manually:\napt-get download gnome-panel-data\ndpkg -x gnome-panel-data_*.deb gnome_panel_data_fs\nsudo tee /usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries > /dev/null < gnome_panel_data_fs/usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries\n\nAnd fix apt:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nA: Could be wrong (if so, let me know), but I think that --reinstall is equal to remove and then install.\nRemove would produce a package status of \"rc\" meaning:  \n\npackage removed but config files still saved\n\ntherefore, install would not touch them.\nSo, here's my two cents:\n1) You could try to rename the 'bad' file (05_panel-default-setup.entries) first e.g.:  \nsudo mv 05_panel-default-setup.entries 05_panel-default-setup.entries.bad \nand then do a:  \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-panel-data\n2) Go with a:  \nsudo apt-get purge gnome-panel-data (in order to delete configuration files also)  \nand then a:  \nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel-data\n", "Q: Is the command line structure the same for Linux and Ubuntu? I'm new to the Linux world. I'm curious to know if the command line syntax is the same between Linux and Ubuntu?\n\nA: In Ubuntu the command line is managed by bash, the Bourne Again SHell, unless you change the default.\nIts syntax is the same on every linux box, apart from version differences.\nIt is different if we talk about the system tools, that can have some little or big differences, for example in the field of package management.\n\nA: Just to clarify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux is the kernel that Ubuntu and many other distributions use.\n\n*Linux is not an operating system.\n\n*A Linux distribution is a set of software that includes an operating system as well as other utilities that make the operating system useful. (ie gnome)\n\n*Because they are different things, a distribution and a kernel are not comparable items.\n\n\nUbuntu is a Linux distribution that uses the Linux kernel, the standard GNU toolkit and a whole lot of other free software stacked on top.\nThe command-line utilities are not provided by Linux. Most core utilities are provided by the GNU project. Some are specific to the distribution (eg apt-get is specific to Debian-based distros). The rest come from any number of other independent sources. \nDepending on your definition of 'command-line structure', every GNU distribution uses the same 'command-link structure'. I would consider android, for instance, a Linux distribution but not an GNU distribution. Most Linux distributions adhere to the Linux Standard Base. This sets out the rules for where files go, and how things are structured (amongst other things). \nOn the other hand, you could also say that 'command-line structure' changes based on the shell that you use.\n\nA: The simple answer is yes, the command line structure of Linux is the same as the command line structure of Ubuntu. \"Linux\" is often used, loosely, to refer to operating systems as a whole which are built around the Linux kernel; more accurate descriptions are more wordy.\nCurrently, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution for personal computers. A default installation of Ubuntu includes all the commonly used command line tools for Linux-based operating systems, including the BASH shell and the full suite of GNU tools. If someone says, \"Do this in Linux\", it will almost certainly be something you can do in Ubuntu, and there's a good chance that Ubuntu was what they had in mind when they said \"Linux\".\n", "Q: 11.04 boot takes over 4 minutes I did a fresh install of Xubuntu 11.04 on a clean disk. CPU Athlon 64 X2 3600+, 1 GiB of RAM. The machine is about 5 years old and works like a charm normally.\nBuuut: The normal boot takes about 4 minutes with XU 11.04, including a 3 minute pause time where the machine does nothing (see bootchart 1, kern.log (see lines around 742). If I add \"noapic nolapic acpi=off\" the boot time is reduced a lot, but there's still a pause of approximately half a minute (see second bootchart image in above link). I also tried disabling legacy USB support in BIOS (didn't change anything).\nEspecially since there's still a lot of pause in the second boot I'm wondering if there's anything else to help it.\nSecondly the first bootchart is making me wonder how the times in there are given. It states the boot process finished after less than a minute which obviously is wrong if you look in the kern.log. Is there something that makes the system like completely frozen in that period of time where it does nothing so bootchart can't even account the time?\nRegards,\nChris\n\nA: Seems like blacklisting the sound module did the trick.

So, I'm using Ubuntu for the first time, and I like it in general. I've got this problem with the launcher, though: I can't drag and drop ANYTHING on to the desktop, only make shortcuts and folders from a menu. If I drag and drop a file into the Desktop folder from the file system, I can then see it on the desktop. I've seen other people discussing this, so I guess it's a known issue -- and responses range from \"here's a workaround\" to \"just use GNOME\". I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how the team could decide to make Unity the default UI on a distro made for simplicity and ease of use when it's still missing such an incredibly basic feature. Am I just missing something here? Is there an easy way to make this happen? If not, does anyone know... well... why?\n\nA: Why Unity was made default in 11.04 despite of obvious short-comings? Easy, although I'm not a representative of either Canonical or anything like that. \nIn April, Ubuntu 12.04LTS will be released. It'll be supported on the desktop for 3 years. Gnome2 is deprecated and we needed something new. Supporting the old desktop until 2015 was not a real option. It was decided that Unity is the way forward and because of the extra importance of 12.04LTS, it was important to speed up development -- exactly because Unity isn't ready for the masses. The easiest way of doing that, is to get it into the wild as soon as possible, expose it to a large audience and get lots of feedback and bugreports. That way, it can be made rock solid and polished by the release of 12.04LTS -- which is when Ubuntu will hit the fa... masses. \n10.04LTS has been quite nice since the day it was released and I'd say it's perfect for most users. However, it is not very appealing. Even if it's a modern operating system, it looks somewhat dated. And that matters to a lot of users. When 12.04LTS is released, it will be just as stable, user friendly and efficient -- but it will be much more appealing. Unity is a lot more efficient to work with too, which is very important to heavy desktop users. \nBut this was already a difficult cycle because of other changes in the \"ecosystem\", such as the transition to Gnome3. If the introduction of Unity was to be pushed into the 11.10-cycle, then that would leave absolutely no margin for error when it comes to 12.04LTS, which after all is much more important. If you gamble that nothing goes wrong, then I will take your bet. \nSo in essence, you might say 11.04 is something like a beta for 12.04LTS and the LTS-es have to have significantly higher priority. That's what most end-users will stick to, and that's what nearly all businesses will use. That's what third-party software developers will develop for, what computer manufacturers will bundle, etc. But even if non-LTS versions get a lower priority, that doesn't mean they shouldn't be of high quality. Going from 10.04LTS to 12.04LTS is likely to be much, much harder than from 12.04LTS to 14.04LTS, so even if 11.04 isn't quite as rock solid as we would like, I'm confident that it is an exception. \nAll things considered, I'm really impressed by how well Unity works. It's come a very long way in a very short time.\nAs you can see, I picked one of your questions and answered it. As to the other ones, I didn't really understand them. But the launcher is for applications, not for files, folders or other things. You have the files and folders lense for that.\n\nA: With Unity, Desktop shortcuts are a thing of the past.\nYou now have the Favorites Launcher.\nThe suggestion to \"just use GNOME\" is technically correct.\nYou want desktop shortcuts? Use GNOME 2.3x\n\nA: You can create a link and just move it to the desktop, but I don't recommend it, just for the sake of cleanness. Personally I store the most frequently used apps to the left. All other apps are launched through the Search in Dash.\n\nA: I have the same problem as you. In my case, I have several applications that I run from my home directory, which I downloaded as tar.gz, so they do not add shortcuts to the menu that you can find with Dash or Synapse or anything.\nThe following gave me the solution: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/11/create-desktop-shortcuts-icons-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot/\nBasically, it says to do:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\n(You may have this installed already).\nThen run the following for each new shortcut you want to create:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nIt opens the shortcut dialog that you know and love and allows you to edit the settings, and saves it in the given directory (~/Desktop in this example).\n", "Q: \"Could not determine the upgrade\" while trying to update from 10.10 to 11.04 The error message I get on trying to upgrade is\n\nCould not determine the upgrade\n\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade:\n\nE:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be\n  caused by held packages.\nThis can be caused by:  * Upgrading to a pre-release version of\n  Ubuntu  * Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu  *\n  Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu\nIf none of this applies, then please report this bug against the\n  'update-manager' package and include the files in\n  /var/log/dist-upgrade/ in the bug report.\n\nFollowing the advice in another forum posting I have already tried sudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau but this has not helped.

(  T _ T )  Thank you for your help~\n\nA: Connecting to ethernet does not ensure that your Internet is connected. Successful establishment of Auto eth 0 connection tells us that modem and ethernet port are now connected, but there is no information about whether modem is connected to internet or not. So the problem is with your modem, either reboot your modem, or ask the ISP that you are not able to connect to internet through modem.

Moreover, it is the standard used by Ubuntu, so I recommend staying with it.\n\nA: Ubuntu Manpage for rsyslogd says this \n\n... First  of  all there has been a systematic attempt to\n         insure that rsyslogd follows its default,  standard  BSD  behavior...\n  rsyslogd should be able to use  a\n         standard  syslog.conf  and  act  like  the orginal syslogd. However, an\n         original syslogd  will  not  work  correctly  with  a  rsyslog-enhanced\n         configuration file. At best, it will generate funny looking file names. \n  The second important concept to note is that this version  of  rsyslogd\n         interacts  transparently  with  the  version  of  syslog  found  in the\n         standard  libraries.   If  a  binary  linked  to  the  standard  shared\n         libraries  fails  to function correctly we would like an example of the\n         anomalous behavior.\n\nSo rsyslogd is not very much different from syslogd. Then why do we need rsyslogd?\nThis page provides a comparison chart rsyslogd vs. syslogd-ng\nThis blog post explains why a second syslogd?. Excerpts from it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*.. So one reason the world needs another syslogd is that it needs another major player in the *nix space. I honestly believe there is none except syslog-ng..\n  \n*.. have you noticed that syslog-ng has become dual-licensed? There is the great GPLed open source release and the even greater \"Premium Edition\", which cost money. Only the premium edition offers features like native database and SSL support or queued syslog sending..\n  \n*..\"Stop\", I hear some say, \"syslog-ng is GPLed, so we can take that source and implement the missing features\". Of course you can. But do you think Balabit will actually include your patches? I guess we can agree on \"nope\". So you have just forked from syslog-ng ... and proved my argument that the world needs another syslogd..\n  \n*.. So - why does the world need another syslogd?             It needs one that aims to be a real major player, being installed on a lot of systems. That will help to get the best out of syslog technology (and in the long term the best of logging at all). Either in its project itself of by driving competitors to be better than it. A new major player will prevent monocultures and provide a rich freedom of choice. That's why the world needs it. \n\n", "Q: NVIDIA Nouveau Driver: No more 3D acceleration? After playing around with my drivers, my Nouveau driver no longer seems to support 3D acceleration: Compiz effects are gone, as are 3D gaming capabilities.\nNouveau is still doing something correctly in 2D (e.g. the 1600x900 resolution is still correct, as compared to no NVIDIA driver at all, when it's 1280x768 instead).\nHow do I fix this without reinstall Ubuntu for the billionth time?\n\nxorg.conf's that I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*(empty)\n\n*This (which was the original):\nSection \"Device\"\n       Identifier      \"Default Device\"\n       Driver  \"nouveau\"\nEndSection\n\nOther things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*modprobe nouveau\n\n*sudo apt-get purge xserver-xorg-video-nouveau --remove\n\n*sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau --reinstall\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling through Additional Drivers\n\nA: Fixed...\n(But I'm not sure why!)\nI followed these instructions to reinstall the drivers, and rebooted.\nNothing changed.\nThen I went into Additional Drivers and enabled Nouveau (which I'd already enabled and disabled numerous times, and which should have been enabled here)... and then I got 3D after I rebooted.\n", "Q: How do I create panes within a Nautilus window? This morning my cat discovered a Nautilus feature I wasn't aware of. By sitting on my keyboard she split the Nautilus window into two panes.

Can I install a GUI on my server via SFTP? Can someone tell me the procedure to run Nomachines?\nIf someone has a different service they'd wanna recommend me to connect to my vps then feel free, I just wanna get the job done.\nthis Is precisely what I want to do : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgfuOYEmCJs&feature=related\nthank you.\n\nA: To install a gui on your server, you're best following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerGUI. That will get a GUI on your system.\nThe next step is to get remote desktop software. NoMachines looks like a proprietary implementation of NX technology (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_technology). There is an open source implementationm called FreeNX which works on Ubuntu and the Wiki has a tutorial for setting it up: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX. There is also a free implementation created by Google, but it seems less feature complete at the moment.\nThere are also a couple of other Remote Desktop protocols that you could have a look at such as VNC. I've used it in the past for this style of thing and it's worked well. There's more info about it on the Wiki (search it for VNC, I can only post 2 links per comment here).\n\nA: If you have SSH access to the server and you have administrator privileges, the following steps should work to get NoMachine up and running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit http://www.nomachine.com/download.php\n\n*Click \"NX Free Edition for Linux\"\n\n*Click \"NX Free Edition for Linux DEB i386\" (or amd64, if it's a 64-bit VPS)\n\n*Download all three packages (client, node, server). That'll give you 3 .deb files.\n\n*Upload these .deb files to your server with sftp\n\n*Connect to your server over SSH, e.g. with PuTTY on Windows\n\n*Run the following commands in your SSH session:\nsudo dpkg -i nxclient_3.5.0-7_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i nxnode_3.5.0-3_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i nxserver_3.5.0-4_i386.deb\n\n(assuming those are the names of the .deps you uploaded)\n\n*Now try connecting to the server with nxclient from your local machine.\n\n\nA: I would have a look at X2Go. It's also based on Nomachines NX libraries, like FreeNX, NeatX and Nomachines own NX Server. But unlike the other products, the server and clients are not compatible. They've made quite a few changes. The most important one, in my opinion, is that they use PulseAudio for audio integration. This means you can use VoIP over the network, which is not possible with FreeNX, NeatX or Nomachine NX Server.\n", "Q: After upgrade to 11.04, my laptop randomly turns off the external display I recently upgraded from Maverick to Natty and this problem has appeared after the upgrade - it never happened while I was on Maverick.\nI'll try to explain this as well as I can.\nOn Maverick when I plugged/unplugged the external display to my laptop I had to manually enable/disable the external display from the Monitors dialog.\nBut on Natty, when I plug/unplug the monitor this is automatically detected and the display is enabled/disabled, without me needing to go that Monitors dialog and do anything. I think that the OS does some polling of the external display port to see if something is plugged.\nMy problem is, when I have already plugged an external monitor and am using it, sometimes it becomes disabled by the OS, as if I had went to the Monitors dialog and disabled it manually, only I didn't do anything, I am watching a movie and I'm not near the computer at all. I think that this autodetect feature disables it. It seems that it thinks that I have unplugged the cable, even though I haven't. I think that the VGA cable doesn't make good contact with the pins in the laptop's VGA port so it might be disconnecting for a fraction of the second, but this wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't this autodetect feature.\n\nA: Try Caffeine to keep your monitor on, use these command in Terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nCaffeine is used to supress any power saving mode from being turned on; e.g. When you're watching a film and the screen goes into idle mode.\nI use Caffeine myself and think it's brilliant.\n", "Q: Removed python from my install, how do I get it back? I just typed \nsudo apt-get remove python2.6\n\nI didn't realized that this command will uninstall the whole packages from my computer. Is it possible to uninstall the ubuntu without CD.

This is because gnome-terminal cannot distinguish between these keys and sends and EOF in both the cases. Is there a ways I can configure this and tell gnome-terminal to differentiate these keys.\nThe reason I am asking for this is because I use tmux in gnome-terminal and I'd like to bind tmux actions to C-S-z, C-S-d etc., but doing so renders the non-shift variants of those keys to the same tmux bindings. In other words, I want C-S-d to do a tmux action that I bind, but C-d to send an EOF. Currently, both these key combinations do the same thing, whatever it may be.\nSomeone on IRC freenode.net#tmux suggested that gnome-terminal might be sending the same key codes for both these key combinations and so tmux is unable to distinguish between them. I also learnt that xterm and rxvt can be configured to do this, but I'd like to know if gnome-terminal can do it.\nAny ideas ont hsi appreciated :)\n\nA: If you don't need C-d at all (you can close a terminal with exit, after all), you could try to remove its association with EOF, and associate EOF with another unuseful sequence, C-j for example:\nstty eof ^J\n\nI cannot say if it also will free the use of C-S-d.\nIf it works, that command should be set in ~/.bashrc, for example.\n", "Q: Trac Setup Error I'm trying to setup the trac, this is the commands that I used:\nsudo apt-get install trac python-setuptools libapache2-mod-python enscript\n\nsudo mkdir /var/www/trac\nsudo trac-admin /var/www/trac/repos initenv\n\nbut I'm getting the following error:\nFile \"/usr/local/bin/trac-admin\", line 5, in <module>\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 2659, in <module>\n    parse_requirements(__requires__), Environment()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 546, in resolve\n    raise DistributionNotFound(req)\npkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: Trac==0.12.2\n\n\nA: Obviously trac-admin requires Trac==0.12.2.

Then on your server, set up UFW (Uncomplicated FireWall) to Drop (the GUI for UFW, called GUFW, calls this DENY) traffic from your LAN. Of course, make an exception for the host. This should block traffic to your VM from your LAN except pings. If you want to block pings, you may have to tweak some of UFW built in rules. (I could add more about this if you need it).\nThe other option is to set up a shared interface between the host and VM. Then on the host make an /etc/network/interfaces with a static address. You would do the same on the VM (except with a different address). Then you would login to your router for your LAN and add a route to the address block you used for your VM/Host shared interface using the host computer as the gateway. (You will probably want to have the host connect to the router with a static address so that you don't have to change the route all the time). You'll want to edit /etc/sysctl.conf as root and set ip.forward to =1. You would then set up UFW on the Host to Drop packet from the LAN destined for your server. (I'll expand+add details to this second option if you decide you want to do it this way and ask).\n\nA: Another possibility is to use NAT networking and forward port 80 to your VM.\nThat way your server should be able to access everything (internet and LAN), your server will not be visible to your lan. Connections to the port 80 of your real computer will actually connect to port 80 in your virtualised server.\nYou can check your web server from your host (real computer) pointing a browser to localhost.\nYou configuration should look like this:\n\nNote that you don't need to fill the IP field.\n", "Q: Install/upgrade to Apache ant 1.8.2 How to install/upgrade Apache Ant 1.8.2 with apt-get on Ubuntu natty. I tried sudo apt-get upgrade ant and sudo apt-get install ant(after removing the already installed version ie.,1.8.1) but nothing works. Every time it installs Ant 1.8.1 only.\n\nA: As you have found - you cannot \"upgrade\" this way.

The -d flag tells apt-get to only download the package and not install it.

How can I add in the regular expressions for an additional syntax language?\n\nA: I assume you are talking about gedit (labeled as \"text editor\" in the ubuntu menu).\nGedit is using GtkSourceView for syntax highlighting. You have to create a language definition for GtkSourceView.\nHere is a tutorial: https://developer.gnome.org/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html\nupdate 2021: link dead. now here: https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html\ni do not know why it is \"developer-old\" now. maybe deprecated. i was not able to find a new tutorial. but i did not search much.\nhere is the new gnome developer tutorials: https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials.html\ni did not find a gedit syntax highlight tutorial there.\n\nA: Gedit (the default text editor) using GTKSourceView for it's syntax highlighting. It uses XML files to define how to highlight different syntax.\nThere is a tutorial and a reference document on the GTKSourceView site. Finished source file definitions are stored in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ or /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/, you might want to check them out to learn by example.\nThere is also a less in depth tutorial on the Gedit site.\nAfter you create your new language spec, restart gedit and it will automatically add it to its list of languages.\n", "Q: Command line: create file with new filename if the filename already exists I was wondering if it was possible have a command that creates one file, but every time the command is executed, it wouldn't overwrite the file created in the previous execution.\nFor example: touch test1.txt would create 1 file called test1.txt. But the next time I execute it, I would like the new file to be called test2.txt, or something like that. So without overwriting the already existing file. In a way it could be executed multiple times without problems.\nDon't misunderstand me, I'm not trying to create multiple files with one command.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The easiest solution would be to add a timestamp to the filename and not use a single digit.\nThe easiest method to create an empty file would be touch test$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) and that would result in a file named test20110802-170410. A 2nd time test* will get a newer timestamp so it will result in 2 files.\n\nA: I doubt a general command exist to do that, but you can think of something like this:\ncreate() {\n  read prefix number suffix < <(sed -r 's/(.*)([0-9]+)\\.(.*)$/\\1 \\2 \\3/' <<<\"$1\")\n  while true; do\n    file=\"$prefix$number.$suffix\"\n    if [[ -e \"$file\" ]]; then\n      ((number++))\n    else\n      touch \"$file\"\n      break\n    fi\n  done\n}\n\nThe input parameter to the function is split in prefix, number, suffix, then until the file exists, the number is incremented.

I have replicated the issue on my home wireless access point.\nNot sure whether this has anything to do with the issue, but when I run iwlist wlan0 scan there are a number of results with ESSID:\"\\x00\".\nI'm going to see whether I can get the MAC address of the router to see which one is a match.\nThe output from lspci | grep -i Network\n02:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43225 802.11b/g/n (rev 01)\n\nAny suggestions (aside from renaming the SSID) most welcome!\n\nA: SSIDs are limited to upper and lower case letters and numbers and a maximum length of 32 characters. Even though it's not technically legit, you could try doubling the underscores when you enter the name, per Launchpad bug 685588 in case it's the accelerator bug you are hitting.\n", "Q: Closing the terminal where \"compiz --replace\" is run, causes compiz to crash again So every once in a while compiz will crash, sometimes randomly, more often when I'm messing with the compiz settings. \nI can restart compiz with compiz --replace, and it fixes the window decoration, etc., but that command never finishes in the terminal. If I close the terminal or ctrl-C, it causes compiz to crash all over. So the only thing I can do is just leave that terminal running (not a great solution).\n\nA: This is the normal expected behaviour. If you hit CTRL+C compiz will stop. If you want to detach some command from the terminal (so it will not terminate with the terminal, and it will allow you to continue to use it) you can use nohup, like this:\nnohup compiz --replace\n\nThere is much more info in this question.\n\nA: You can also use the Compiz Fusion Icon, which can easily be installed by dropping in a terminal the next:\nsudo apt-get install fusion-icon\n\nAnd after providing your password the fusion icon will be installed and a shortcut can be reached inside of the \"System Tools\" menu in the majority of the cases, if not, in a terminal drop the next: \nfusion-icon\n\nand in the Fusion Icon menu (right click), choose \"Reload window manager\" in order to force Compiz to reload, after which all your compiz features will get enabled and should not break after closing the Fusion Icon (even from Terminal).\n\nGood Luck!\n\nA: You can use this as an alternative to nohup: compiz --replace &\n", "Q: How do I decide which manpage to use on the Ubuntu Manuals site? I've found the Ubuntu Manuals site (http://manpages.ubuntu.com) very useful for looking up manpages when I'm not at a computer with Ubuntu on it. However, I've found that sometimes the search results table links to multiple manpages with the same name. \nFor example, performing this search for grep results in two links for each distribution, both labeled grep(1): one to grep.1posix.html and one to grep.1.html.\nI've heard of Ubuntu being \"POSIX-compliant\", so how do I know which manpage will be most applicable to a typical Ubuntu install? (Or, how do I know which manpage shows up when I use the man command?)\n\nA: As the man manual page says:\nA section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.\nThe default action is to search in all of the available sections, following a \npre-defined order and to show only the first  page  found,  even  if\npage exists in several sections.\n\nIn the config file /etc/manpath.config you find the actual order used:\n1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 5 4 9 6 7\n\nAlso, man -a $command will show all pages found in all sections, and -S $section-list option override default order.\nA last note: you probably will find man 1posix grep will not work on your system, because the package manpages-posix is not installed by default.\n", "Q: Why only home directory? I want to save my Ubuntu-One folder in my secondary HD, just like my Dropbox folder. I know that saving data in a secondary disk is \"the old way\", but i bring this habit from my kid days using windows. Is it going to be always this way, or will I be able to share other folders outside /home in the future??\n\nA: I suppose the reason might be that it's more difficult to sync files on removable devices. How should Ubuntu One react when you disconnect the device? If you remove a file, then Ubuntu One will delete it from all your devices and from your online storage. This could be overcome for removable devices, of course, but it is a special case and I don't think it has high priority. \nI don't know how Ubuntu One decides not to sync files outside your home directory. It may be possible to mount the partition in your home. But it is also possible that if you unmount it, Ubuntu One will delete those files from synced devices. So be cautious if you try this. \n\nA: What you're saying makes sense. But I was not talking about removable devices. In this particular case is an internal SATA HDD that I use to store only data.\nI do not know if it does make any difference if it is removable or not because it need to be mounted anyway. \nThe thing is that I have my dropbox directory in that device and it syncs perfectly.\nMaybe because dropbox syncs only with the dropbox directory, and you can sync as many directories as you want with Ubuntu One (always inside /~). It seem like two different approaches. But at the end is the same, with dropbox you only sync what is inside of /dropbox, with Ubuntu One you only sync what is inside of /home.\nI will take a look further in time, either when I change my storing philosophy or if Ubuntu One changes theirs. The first one feels more probable.\nThank you very much for your reply.\n", "Q: How do I turn off WLAN automatically when LAN is connected? I use my Thinkpad laptop with a docking station. The docking station is connected to my router via LAN. When I walk around the house I use my laptop with WLAN.\nIs it possible (and how) to manage these devices with a script or something to work like this:\nIf a LAN-Connection is up, the OS should turn off Wifi and if LAN-Connection gets lost (undocking) Wifi should turn on automatically.\nI use Ubuntu 11.04 64bit with Gnome 2. The system works on an Lenovo ThinkPad R500 with.\nWLAN-Device: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN [Shiloh]\nLAN-Device: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5787M Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express (rev 02)\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: I think you might be making this harder than it has to be. I have the same situation with my laptop (except it's a normal ethernet port instead of a dock). When I plug in the wired network, it automatically takes precedence over the wireless and everything goes over the (faster) ethernet cord. The wireless was connected all along, but unused. When I unplug the cable it falls back to using the wireless connection. \nSo, have you tried to see if this does what you want already? I'm using nothing more than the standard network applet that comes with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I'm also happily using a ThinkPad with a dock, but for me @Azendale's answer was not the case: after removing the laptop from the dock, internet connection would go down and required to reconnect WiFi to make it work.\nSo i googled up this solution and it works: https://superuser.com/a/367472/200497\nAs this question appears high in Google search results, i decided to share the link here.\n\nA: If you are already using tlp for power management, it has a feature to do this.\nYou have to modify your conf file (/etc/default/tlp)\n# Radio devices to enable/disable when docked.\n#DEVICES_TO_ENABLE_ON_DOCK=\"\"\nDEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_DOCK=\"wifi wwan\"\n\n# Radio devices to enable/disable when undocked.\nDEVICES_TO_ENABLE_ON_UNDOCK=\"wifi\"\n#DEVICES_TO_DISABLE_ON_UNDOCK=\"\"\n\n\nA: In my Toshiba Portege z935 ultrabook, there is a setting in the BIOS that controls how the LAN and WLAN work together. One setting allows it to disable WLAN when the LAN cable is plugged in.\nIt may be worth it to peruse your BIOS settings and possibly update your BIOS in case it has been added as a feature. I would update BIOS as a last resort since it can result in making your system inoperable if the flashing of the updated version fails.\n", "Q: Gnome-Panel missing I am using Ubuntu 11.10. I removed the new mac look to make ubuntu look like classic ubuntu of previous versions. After that only desktop is there. Rest everything is missing including panels. But from login menu in GDM I can choose Classic ubuntu and login to get all details. Otherwise in normal Ubuntu login it is not possible. How can I get back that panel.\nEven Alt+f2 not working\n\nA: If you want the old Windows 95-look (to use your kind of language), then you should consider switching to Xfce, or at least xfce4-panel, which is similar to gnome-panel. It even supports gnome-panel applets.  Gnome2 as you've been used to, is deprecated and not developed anymore. I don't think it's even possible to run it properly with 11.10. Xfce is actively developed though, and is a very suitable replacement for the more conservative. \nThere is something called gnome-panel 3, but that's completely different.\n", "Q: How to avoid opening duplicate files in new windows in gedit? Having already opened several text files with each in one tab in a window, \nnow open another text file, \n\n\n*\n\n*gedit sometimes creates another window instead of a session under\nthe current window. I wonder if it is possible to control whether to\nopen the next file under the current window, or in a new one?\n\n*if the text file has already been opened, gedit sometimes open it\nagain in another window, and ask me if I want to edit or not. I was\nwondering how to make gedit not to open a file already opened?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: If you open the file from gedit (Ctrl+O, or use the big 'Open' button shown) it will open the new file in a new tab. If you open new files from Nautilus (or another file manager), it may or may not. Also, as @harisibrahimkv points out, files with different permissions/users will be handled differently.  \n\n\nA: This sometimes happen if you are trying to open files with different permissions. As in, if you open a file with sudo while gedit is already open, it might open in another window.\n", "Q: Dual boot and sleep/hibernate issues? I set up a dual boot before, but I've never thought about how or if putting a laptop to sleep or hibernate will affect grub or the OSes.\nFor example, if I dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu, then use windows and put it to either sleep or hibernate, will something go horribly wrong if I select ubuntu at the grub menu?\n\nA: From a similar question on Super User:\nGenerally speaking, you can hibernate one operating system and boot the other. Each system's state is saved in its own swap space, so you must not share the swap space between the two operating systems.\nThere's one thing you must pay attention to: while a partition is mounted in a hibernated operating system, you must not access it from other operating systems. With most filesystems, this is likely to destroy your data. (This doesn't apply to network filesystems mounted from another machine, these are designed to be mounted from multiple places at once.) Exception: if the shared partition is NTFS and it's not the Windows boot partition, it's safe to share at the filesystem level (but you'd better not keep a file open in a hibernated application, so it's better to unmount the shared partition before hibernating anyway).\n\nA: No, the ram state is stored into the swap file or swap partition.\nSince you use different swap spaces for ubuntu and windows 7, you should be able to..\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernate on windows\n\n*Boot into linux and then hibernate\n\n*Boot into windows and resume session.. Hibernate again.\n\n*Boot into linux and resume linux session.\n\n\nNow, if you use two operating systems that are sharing the same swap space.. I have no idea what will happen. I dual boot two linux distros that use the same swap partition, so I have to careful of this. (well, I would be if I ever used hibernate =p)\n", "Q: Newbie questions for ubuntu server setup?

When I run this, I get the error \"Unable to locate package svn\".  Why is this?  How do I fix it?\n\nA: apt-get is an amazing package manager, but often the names of packages aren't exactly named the way you would expect. (Obviously not the fault of apt-get) for example, downloading java isn't apt-get install java.\nas for your issue,  the name of the svn package in apt-get is subversion.\napt-get install subversion\nhave fun with your subversion needs!\n\nA: The package is called subversion  (abbreviated svn). You've to install it by running:\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\nThis package contains the svnserve daemon too (not started by default). If you want to host a subversion server over HTTP, you must install apache2 and configure it accordingly.\n\nA: There is no package with the name of SVN .\nYou may type this command on terminal.\nsudo apt-get install subversion \n\nThen you can check it using svn command \nsvn co \"type here your checkout URL without double quotes\"\n\nsvn status \n\nsvn commit ...........your file name \n\n", "Q: Run the same browser on two different desktop instances? With my two-video-card setup I'm currently forced to run two non-Xinerama desktops side-by-side, each with their own gnome-panels. (When I move my mouse off the edge of one, input focus changes to the next one.) Additionally, sometimes I remote login to a desktop computer and I have two desktops running: one on the console and one connected to the remote terminal.\nIn both cases, I have not found a web browser that execute on both desktops at the same time. You may have exactly one instance per user per profile, and that instance runs on exactly one desktop -- not two or more. The only workaround is to run different browser profiles on each desktop (i.e. \"firefox -profile $path-of-second-profile\") and these separate profiles of course never share any data with each other.\nI find this multiple-instance restriction with Opera, Firefox, Chrome, Midori, and Konquerer and at this point I've given up. In contrast, tools like Gnome-panel, Gnome-terminal, Nautilus, Thunar, Gedit, and Okular are happy to run multiple instances on different desktops simultaneously.\nIs there a browser out there that supports what I want, and fully supports JavaScript, Java, and Flash?\n\nA: This might not really be the answer that you are looking for, but since I can't comment (weird restrictions :| ), here goes:\nA solution to your problem could be that you sync your userdata between the two browsers. I know that at least Opera (Link), Firefox and Chrome (both Sync) offer it. You connect your user data to an email adress and it is synced automatically. This also works across devices (In Chrome it's located at Preferences -> Personal Stuff -> Set up sync)\n\nA: Go to the workspace you need a separate window opened and middle-click on the browser.

The only way I want to be able to access it is remotely via SSH. But, sometimes, say after a power loss, when the server restarts, it will get stuck on the Grub boot menu, and it won't count down. It will just hang there waiting for me to choose the first boot entry. This means I have to go there and plug in a monitor and keyboard.\nBut I can't do that remotely. How can I force it to continue booting to boot entry 1 (default) regardless of power loss or whatever? \n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.04, a more straightforward, but nevertheless undocumented, solution is to use /etc/default/grub to override the recordfail timeout:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT\n\nThen run sudo update-grub to apply the changes.\n\nThe fact that such option is completely undocumented is just too bad.\nActually, the support for GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT was added in the middle of the 12.04 cycle, starting from version 1.99-21ubuntu3.3:\n  grub2 (1.99-21ubuntu3.3) precise-proposed; urgency=low\n\n[ Ben Howard ]\n* Parameterization of recordfail setting.

I'm looking for a PPA for Ruby 1.9.2 for Lucid Lynx, and I've noticed that there's a couple of them. Is it possible to determine which one is more commonly used, and therefore more likely to be error-free?\n\nA: The important thing to remember is that anyone can register a PPA. The main question you need to ask yourself is do you trust the PPA's owner. The level of trust needed depends on the package and what you hope to do with it. I might trust a PPA for an indicator based on the recommendation of a blog that I follow, but I'd want to know a lot more about the PPA owner if I were looking to upgrade X on my desktop or Ruby on a production server.\nYou should look at the PPA's owner on Launchpad. Is it team maintainer? What else is the owner involved with? Is the owner involved with the software upstream? Is the owner an Ubuntu developer?\nRemember when you add a PPA to your sources, the main concern isn't the installation of a single package, it's that you are more or less giving the PPA root access to your machine through the ability to push updates.\nThough it works the other way as well. Is the owner still actively providing security updates? foo 1.0 in Lucid might be a bit old, but at least it is still receiving security updates. foo 1.2 from Joe Bob's PPA might be more recent, but if a security bug is found to affect both version is he going to provide an update? Check their Lauchpad profile to make sure they are at least active.\nHere's a scary story. I was investigating a PPA to possibly recommend to you for getting Ruby 1.9.2 on Lucid. Unfortunately one seeming popular one I came across is run by an \"open\" team. Team membership confers upload right to the team's PPA. As it now stands, someone could potentially join the team and upload a compromised version of the software in the PPA at anytime.\n\nA: First you check what is available in the official repositories.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and perform a search for ruby. In the search options, try lucid, lucid-updates (only of Ruby had a security update) and lucid-backports (only for newer versions that have been packaged back for lucid).\n\n\nI performed the search and found that there is only one version of Ruby available (in lucid), and it is version 4.2. When you mention version 1.9.2, do you refer to the ruby package or some companion package?\n\nA: There are unofficial ones that people compile code to and stick up for anyone (brave enough) to use but the official and (probably better tested) version is the one in  http://packages.ubuntu.com/  - which you can access via synaptic. I wouldn't touch the other PPAs for production systems.\nThe short answer seems to be that the only supported version of Ruby at the moment on Ubuntu is 1.8. Don;t touch 1.9.1 with a barge-poll if you're using Rails - there's even a message on the Rails homepage to that effect.\n", "Q: Problem upgrading Ubuntu 9.10 I've been trying to upgrade my version on Ubuntu from 9.10 to 10.04 (and eventually to the latest), but I'm having trouble with broken packages.\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update\n\n*apt-get upgrade\n\n*apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n*dpkg --configure -a (not sure why)\n\n\nI'm not sure what's relevant, so I'm going to dump what I've got:\nOutput from upgrade attempt:\n$ sudo do-release-upgrade\nChecking for a new ubuntu release\nDone Upgrade tool signature\nDone Upgrade tool\nDone downloading            \nextracting 'lucid.tar.gz'\nauthenticate 'lucid.tar.gz' against 'lucid.tar.gz.gpg' \ntar: Removing leading `/' from member names\n\nReading cache\n\nChecking package manager\nReading package lists: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\nDone downloading            \nReading package lists: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\n\nUpdating repository information\nWARNING: Failed to read mirror file\nDone downloading            \n\nChecking package manager\nReading package lists: Donelucid-security/multiverse Packages: 96   gutsy/restricted Packages: 02  \nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\n\nCalculating the changes\n\nCalculating the changes\n\nCould not calculate the upgrade \n\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade: \nE:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. \n\nThis can be caused by: \n* Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu \n* Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu \n* Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu \n\nIf none of this applies, then please report this bug against the \n'update-manager' package and include the files in \n/var/log/dist-upgrade/ in the bug report. \n\n\nRestoring original system state\n\nAborting\nReading package lists: Donekarmic-security/multiverse Packages: 95   utsy/restricted Packages: 02  \nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\nReading state information: Done\n\n/etc/apt/sources.list (with most of the comments stripped)\n$ cat sources.list\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 9.10 _Karmic Koala_ -

Release i386 (20071016)]/ gutsy main restricted\n\n\nA: I think the clue is in the error message -\nits complaining about Gutsy being present.  In your sources.list file you have the CDROM as deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Server 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release i386 (20071016)]/ gutsy main restricted\nd\nUsing the Software Sources window - untick the CDROM.  Alternatively, just add a # against this line in your sources.list file.\n\nA: More than likely, your problem is due to the presence of PPA packages installed on your machine. Since the PPA has newer packages than the official repositories, the upgrade doesn't know how to replace them. Luckily, this is an easy fix with ppa-purge. Check out the article below, or just Google ppa-purge for more info.\nhttp://bigbrovar.aoizora.org/index.php/2010/01/10/how-to-safely-remove-ppa-repository-from-ubuntu/\n\nA: If you have aptitude sudo aptitude search ~b will give you the list of broken packages. You'll most likely recognise which ppa/packages you should remove.\nYou can remove them by installing older version once you remove PPA, (apt-get install package=version) or you can force remove it with dpkg force remove. \nSince it didn't fix the problem you can do it more Debian way. Replace you sources.list content with ubuntu 10.04 sources.list and perform aptitude dist-upgrade. You might end up with several broken packages, but you'll be easily able to fix it by reinstalling them (if you don't have anything important configured manually you can purge those packages and install them). \nIf it did not work there is another option (but it's ugly):\nI had an accident with an upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 (broken packages, upgrade stopped in the middle) and the solution I used to recover was to remove everything but ubuntu-minimal (and a few related things, mainly wifi drivers, you can do this easily in ncurses ui for aptitude, simply type sudo aptitude without any params) and install ubuntu-desktop after switching to new sources.list and upgrading the system via dist-upgrade. \nIt will work, since it's very easy to upgrade minimal system and it will keep your configuration for most of stuff.\nBut at this point, if you have your /home/ dir on a separate partition and you don't have anything important configured by hand (especially /etc/ dir) it would be much easier to install a fresh copy of whatever new Ubuntu you like.\n", "Q: Accessing other partition from the command-line immediately on startup My other hard drive partition (i.e., the Windows partition) is located in /media/OS.\nHowever, I don't seem to be able to access it from the command line when my\nmachine starts up in Ubuntu.\nI have to first open Nautilus and then click on the drive.\nOnly then can I access the drive from the command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a simple way to ensure that the partition is always accessible from the command-line?\n\n\nI thought perhaps there might be some simple command that I could add to the list of \"startup applications\".\n\nA: This is because your Windows partition is not mounted automatically when you started your Ubuntu. It is only mounted when you clicked on that drive in Nautilus. Trying this guide -> AutomaticallyMountPartitions | Ubuntu Community Help Wiki to mount your Windows partition during startup.\n\nA: From commandline you can do\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdx1 /media/OS\n\ninstead of going to nautilus. Replace /dev/sdx1 with your the windows partition. \nEasy setup of auto mounting NTFS partitions taken from Here: \nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\nsudo ./ntfs-config\n\n\nA: Edit /etc/fstab. If you not sure What to put there, mount it first in nautilus, and see output of mount command.\n", "Q: Prevent files from losing focus in Nautilus? One of my pet peeves in Ubuntu:\nI open up a folder with ~50 files in it. I start typing in the file name, and it matches something. I notice that the file I want is right beside it. I press the right arrow... nothing happens. I press it again, thinking it was a mis-press... still nothing happens. Nothing happens until I press Escape, and then select the file -- because the incremental search box has grabbed the focus.\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Hit tab to restore focus to the file list. Then you should be able to navigate with the arrow keys.\n", "Q: How to use Unity Dash in Gnome classic? I am wondering if there is a way to use Unity Dashboard in Gnome-classic? If yes, what are the dependency packages need to be installed? \nUPDATE:\nOr is there any app could do that?\n\nA: There's Currently no way to use the Dash without Unity being active so here's an alternative.\nelementary's Slingshot.\n\nSlingshot launcher is developed by the Elementary team. Here is how to install Slingshot launcher in Ubuntu Natty from elementary team ppa.\n\nAdd the PPA ppa:elementaryart/elementary-dev and install slingshot-launcher from the software center.\nTo use it you simply have to create a launcher in the Gnome Panel with the command slingshot, the same goes for AWN.\n\nSource.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04, there is a way to get the Dash. However, this includes also enabling launcher.\nStart unity-2d-shell as described here: Ubuntu 12.04 Gnome Classic and Unity Launcher\nYou will get the unity launcher, from which you can open the dash. Or use the super/windows key.\nFor autohiding the launcher in 12.04 see this question: Autohide Unity Launcher in Gnome Classic.\n\nA: I don't know exactly what you're trying to accomplish, but it is possible to run gnome-panel and Unity at the same time. Just don't use the upper gnome-panel, because that will create conflicts with the Unity panel. So just delete the upper panel and add gnome-panel to your startup applications, and you will have both.\n", "Q: How to startx with \"-logverbose 6\" arguments? How do I pass the -logverbose 6 arguments to startx? It is necessary for submitting a bug report to Nvidia Support.\n\nA: I like fossfreedom's answer but it isn't what I have done in the past. It might work but I'm not sure keeping the old X instance around is a good thing. Here's what I would do:\nAfter Ubuntu loads to a graphical desktop, drop back to a TTY, log in and run:\nsudo stop gdm   # lightdm instead of gdm on 11.10\nsudo startx -logverbose 6\n\nIt's practically the same, you're just cleaning up the old instance of X before you run the debug instance.\n\nA: Choose a TTY to login i.e. CTRL + ALT + F1\nLogin as yourself\nThen type\nsudo -i\n\nto login as root.\nI imagine nvidia asked you to run nvidia-bug-report.sh\nthen you can startx\nstartx -- -logverbose 6 :2\n\ni.e. this will attempt to start a new X display on TTY 2.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I kept hitting it via Google.  If you're using a newer Ubuntu that uses lightdm, you can edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add this line under [SeatDefaults]:\n\nxserver-command=X -logverbose 6\n\n(Presumably other display managers have similar facilities to control how they start X, you'd want to check their documentation.)\nWhen you reboot, your normal X log file will now have verbose data.  You can add any other command line arguments you need there, as well.\nSource: zless /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz via Is there a list of all the possible configuration options for lightdm?\n", "Q: Can't browse the internet nor ping a host, but dig works I am not able to browse any websites.

Restart your machine, modem and all network affected devices.\n(Otherwise, can you ping Google by IP: 74.125.236.50 ?)\n\nA: You've masked off your IP address as 172.29.XX.YY, but since your subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, you need to make sure that the third octect (the xx, not the yy), is the same as your default router.  If not, then you'll only see PCs on the same subnet as you (172.29.xx).  If your DNS server is on the same subnet as yours, this would explain why nothing, except it, is working.\n\nA: One way to rule out the browser being the problem would be to run:\ntelnet google.com 80\nfrom a Terminal prompt.

I am new to ubuntu, and I would need you guys help.\nI installed Ubuntu Server 10.04 64-bit, and I would like to know:\nWhat are the commands to add an additional file system and make sure it mount at the boot time. Lets say I want to make it on /newContent directory?\nAnd on the root disk, I would like to create 2 additional directories called /myBackup and /myDatabases?\n\nA: Creating the Directories\nTo create the toplevel directories run:\nsudo mkdir /myBackup /myDatabases\n\nYou may also want to make yourself the owner of these folders:\nsudo chown -R ubuntuka:ubuntuka /myBackup /myDatabases\n\n(replace ubuntuka with your user name)\nChoosing a Partition\nYou can list the available partitions using this command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nEach partition will have a location like /dev/sda1. Choose the partition you want to automount and remember this location.\nFinding Partition Information\nYou now need to find the UUID (unique identification) of the partition and the filesystem type. To do this, use the udisks command. I can't remember if this is installed by default but if it isn't, run:\nsudo apt-get install udisks\n\nto install it.\nFinding the UUID\nTo get the UUID (of /dev/sda1 in this example), run:\nudisks --show-info /dev/sda1 | grep uuid\n\nYou will get output like:\n    by-id:                     /dev/disk/by-uuid/228EF188-BDEE-11E0-8F41-F5A84824019B\n uuid:                        228EF188-BDEE-11E0-8F41-F5A84824019B\n   uuid:                      \n\nwhere 228EF188-BDEE-11E0-8F41-F5A84824019B is the UUID.\nFinding the Filesystem Type\nTo get the filesystem type of the partition (/dev/sda1 in the example), run:\nudisks --show-info /dev/sda1 | grep type\n\nYou will get output like:\n  type:                        ext4\n    type:                      0x83\n\nwhere ext4 is the filesystem type.\nBacking up fstab\nTo get partitions to mount on boot, you need to edit /etc/fstab. This file is pretty vital for the use of your computer so you should back up the current version whenever you make a change.\nTo do this, you can run:\nsudo cp -v \"/etc/fstab\" \"/etc/fstab-$(date +%s)\"\n\nYou will get output like this:\n`/etc/fstab' -> `/etc/fstab-1312389815'\n\nFor this example, to restore the old settings run:    \nsudo cp -v \"/etc/fstab\" \"/etc/fstab-$(date +%s)\" && sudo cp -v /etc/fstab-1312389815 /etc/fstab \n\nEditing fstab\nTo edit /etc/fstab, run:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nTo add an automounted partition, add a line like this:\nUUID=228EF188-BDEE-11E0-8F41-F5A84824019B /myBackup ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nand press Ctrl+O to save. This example would automount /dev/sda1 to /myBackup. You will need to replace 228EF188-BDEE-11E0-8F41-F5A84824019B, /myBackup and ext4 with the respective UUID, mountpoint and filesystem type of the partition.\nTesting\nYou don't need to reboot to test this out. Instead, run:\nsudo mount -a\n\nYou should then test to see if the contents of the directories are as you expected.\n\nA: install ntfs-config \nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nIt will help to add additional filesystem in fstab. Don't forget to check internal and external write option.\nNote: if you are using 11.04 then run ntfs-config in terminal. it will show an error : some directory does not found.

Anything specific to some applications (GIMP, etc.)? Will the now-typical scanner buttons to directly scan a PDF document work on some printers and not on others? Etc.\n\nA: I have jet to find a scanner, that Ubuntu has no drivers for. Most scanners use a  standardised USB interface similar to other hid devices such as keyboards, mice etc. If you want to be on the safe side choose a scanner mentioned in the SANE project's supported devices list.\nAs for applications: SANE handles scanners in Ubuntu. They all revert to SANE. You'll be fine.\n\nA: I have had good luck with HP printer/scanners. My current one, HP Photosmart C4750, works well in Ubuntu. It is connected through WIFI and scans to PDF using hplip. I have used HP flatbed USB with success, also. Follow this link hplip for additional information. You can install the hplip and hplip-gui through Synaptic. The one odd thing is the hplip-gui is not linked in the application menu but in  System > Preference.

Direct support under Ubuntu is no longer available from NVIDIA - only through their legacy 173 driver.\nYou will struggle to play HD videos under Ubuntu - the fundamental issue is the lack of VDPAU support for your graphics card in the NVIDIA driver.  VDPAU support is the ability for Ubuntu to offload graphics processing to the graphics card itself - without it your PC is doing much of this work.  It would be useful to add the specs of your PC into your question.\nTips\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if you have vsync support (Sync to VBlank) in your nvidia-settings (opengl/xvideo)-   Turning this on can help.  \n\n*If you are feeling brave - look at overclocking your FX5500 to maximise the framerate possible - search for \"nvclock\" in Software Center.  I've managed to overclock my Geforce 6 by an extra 10% which improves framerate slightly.\n\n*Compiz - this can slow down framerates - look at viewing your video under \"Ubuntu Classic (No Effects)\" if you are using Natty.  If lucid of maverick - look at using Compiz Fusion to do something similar.  Compiz, whilst not significant, if you are looking for the extra 2-5% performance boost could perhaps make a just that little bit of a difference to a slight lag issue.\n\n*You may have more luck with updated X-system.

I can even click the install button then and the font is copied over to my personal ./fonts directory and from there on visible to my apps. But it is not picked up from the system directory.\nHow do I get these fonts available system-wide for all users?\n\nA: Argh, by coincidence I just found the solution. There was a file called ~/.fonts.conf in my home directory that seems to come from Fontmatrix and had a list of rejected fonts, among them the ones I found missing. Simply deleting this file solved the problem. I\nremember that I had played around with Fontmatrix but I'm not sure what caused it to create this file. Anyway, problem solved.\n\nA: I found out, after having similar problems, that in my folder (/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts) there was a file, saying that my licens failed - it gave me a command to use in the terminal to get prompted another licens agreement, which this time made it work.\nNetflix Desktop worked like a charm after that!

If there is already a Nautilus window open, I would rather it open up in a new tab in the existing window (as if I had done Ctrl + T and browsed to the new location). How can I make this happen?\n\nA: I believe it is not possible as\n1) It is a suggested idea at Ubuntu Brainstorm that wasn't implemented yet,\n2) And supposedly after analyzing the source code Shiki didn't find a way to pass this call to nautilus.\n\nA: I wrote a bash script and a launcher for that. \n\n\n*\n\n*First, create the file:\nmkdir ~/bin && gedit ~/bin/nautilus-ctrl-t.sh\n\n\n*Then paste the following, and save:\nif [ \"$(wmctrl -xl | grep \"nautilus\\.Nautilus\")\" == \"\" ]; then\n    nautilus \"$1\" &\nelse  \n    #Save old clipboard value\n    oldclip=\"$(xclip -o -sel clip)\"\n\n    echo -n \"$1\" | xclip -i -sel clip\n    #wmctrl -xF -R nautilus.Nautilus && xdotool key \"ctrl+t\" \"ctrl+l\" && xdotool type \"${1}\" && xdotool key Return\n    wmctrl -xF -R nautilus.Nautilus && xdotool key ctrl+t ctrl+l ctrl+v Return\n\n    #Restore old clipboard value\n    echo -n \"$oldclip\" | xclip -i -sel clip\nfi\n\n\n*Then run the command:\nsudo chmod u+x ~/bin/nautilus-ctrl-t.sh\n\n\n*Now, to create the launcher file, run this command:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/Nautilus-Ctrl-t.desktop\n\n\n*Paste the following, and save:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Nautilus-Ctrl-t\nComment=Launches Nautilus if not yet, otherwise opens a new tab in it\nCategories=FileManager;GNOME;\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/apps/system-file-manager.png\nExec=/bin/bash -c ~/bin/nautilus-ctrl-t.sh\nTerminal=false\n\n\n*Log out, or restart to update the application list and you're done.\nTry that. Hope it helps.\nUPDATE\nAdded a location as a script parameter\nUPDATE 2\nReplaced xdotool type with  xclip\nUPDATE 3\nCleaned up the process by adding numbers. Added mkdir command. Updated the first \"if statement\" because if nautilus is managing the desktop, it will have a pid, but no active window, so better to use wmctrl. Added quotes around the first argument in case there are spaces. Changed the icon for nautilus to be system default in the .desktop file.\n\nA: This is fixable very easily in CentOS 6.2 by going into the Nautilus preferences, on the \"Behavior\" tab and clicking the box called \"Always open in browser windows\".\nYou will know it worked because from that point on, in your folder browsing window, you will see a left hand nav on the window which is the method that Nautilus uses to \"re-use\" the explorer window.\nSo, basically, all you need to figure out is \"how to enable the left-hand navigation menu in a Nautilus browser window\".\n\nA: Whatever desgua said is somewhat right.\nOne option you have is to press Ctrl + T to open a new tab in the same window.\nOr press F3 in Nautilus for split view.\n\nA: Using the bash script above as a starting (thank you!), I created a one-window per workspace script, ThunarTab, specifically for Thunar in XFCE.

What should I do to increase space? Can I allocate more space to Ubuntu from vista?\n\nA: You've installed on a FAT32 partition most likely - which has a single file size limit of 4GB. So Wubi splits the install into separate virtual disks of 4GB. You have one for /, /home and /usr\nOne of these (/) is running out of space (root.disk). There's no way to fix this really - maybe you can clean out your package cache (sudo apt-get clean).\nIt's better to install Wubi on an NTFS partition as then you'll get a single 14GB (or up to 30GB) virtual disk and so you won't have this problem. Or if your FAT32 partition is just for Ubuntu (which it appears it is), then install direct to it (not with Wubi).\n", "Q: My music seems to be in \"unknown artist\" in everywhere but banshee recently Banshee has decided to change my ogg files to \"unknown artist\" everywhere else but Banshee.\nI don't know what's wrong with them but Ubuntu One and Android Music player can't read the artist tag anymore.

It's even working on Ubuntu 11.10!\nThe clearing the cache, suggested here would make the login screen appear (I assume any user saved information was being cleared), however logging in again would cause it to crash.\n\nA: You can debug it with strace and check what is happening just before the segfault : \nstrace -e open spotify\n\n\nA: I have run into the same problem and it seems to be a problem with the facebook connection module in newer versions of the Spotify for Linux binary. \nI don't yet know what causes it, but a workaround until Spotify corrects this bug is to log out facebook from your Spotify account using a Windows or Mac computer, or perhaps using wine in Linux, but this I've not tried myself.

Several of my parents' photos in F-Spot have gone missing.  I can't seem to figure out the location of the photo file that F-Spot expects to find.

Something like Banshee's \"Open Containing Folder\"? I thought previously you could right-click a photo and choose \"Copy File Location\", but I'm not seeing that option in F-Spot 0.8.\n\nA: You could interrogate the f-spot database itself to search for the filename in question.  Once found, the file-location that f-spot was expecting will be available.  This method would be particularly useful if you've got lots of pictures to search for.\nInstall sqlite3:\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\nNow dump the f-spot database:\nsqlite3 ~/.config/f-spot/photos.db .dump > ~/filelocations.csv\n\nUsing LibreOffice Calc - open the file filelocations.csv and search using the filename with the missing picture.  The filename should exist in two rows - one or both of which should display your missing file location.\nfor example\n\n\nA: All the photos are stored in Photos folder in Pictures folder in your home. And each photo is stored according to the date the photo is taken like this \"Pictures/Photos/Year/Month/date\".\nFor example if your photo is taken on 2011-10-20. It is stored in \nPictures/Photos/2011/10/20 path.\n\nA: I found a (slightly complicated) solution.

Normally in windows OS, after install apache, I go to web browser, point to 127.0.0.1, and the webpage will display \"it works\". How do I test my ubuntu server web apache?\n\nA: If you want to test your Apache setup from the host machine, you will need to configure your networking in VirtualBox. There is a great tutorial on that here. Then you would point the browser in your host machine to whatever IP address is assigned to the guest.\n\nA: Either install a text mode browser like w3m or lynx on your server and use that to connect to localhost, or connect from the outside world to your VirtualBox\n\nA: According to the VirtualBox documentation, you have up to 6 networking modes to choose from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not attached - No connection in Guest OS\n\n*Network Address Translation (NAT) - Default selection mode, allowing guest connection to access internet\n\n*Bridged networking - Allow your Guest OS to connect to the network just like another device in the network. (What I normally use)\n\n*Internal networking - Not clear.\n\n*Host-only networking - Allow connection between host and guests only.\n\n*Generic networking - Not clear.\n\n\nSo if you want to test your Ubuntu Server 10.04 in your VirtualBox, you can choose either Bridged Networking or Host-only Networking.\nIf you are using the Bridged Networking which I have tested, you will have to find out your Guest OS IP address. In desktop mode, it is as simple as clicking (or right-click) the Network Manager -> Connection Information.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One uploads unchanged data frequently I ran into the following issue: I'm using Ubuntu One to sync my files (across multiple computers), for what it's intended.\nBut due to some mysterious reason it promts to me, that there will be some files uploaded. And this again and again and so on.\nPlus, when I want to shut down my computer and dismiss the desktop session, I'm notified, that Ubuntu One is currently running or hung up unexpected.\n\nA: As far as I could figure this one out, U1 uploads the smallest files first to shrink the queue of pending files as fast as possible. You can monitor this using a terminal and type:\nwhile true; do u1sdtool --waiting|wc -l; sleep 20;done\n\nThat will give you a neat integer with number of files left. \nThe \"ubuntu notification\" you get in the top right corner, which says that the same file is being uploaded is just presenting the first file on the list - and since your list might contain several large files - then that largest file may be the same number one on the list for quite some time.\nIf the number of files does not reduce itself then i'd recommend make an assessment: If your files are very large then compute the expected time (filesize/bandwidth), and if you think that this has passed hours ago, then restart the sync service using:\nu1sdtool --disconnect; u1sdtool --connect\n\nThen rerun the code (top) to monitor whether the number of files are reducing.\n", "Q: Is there a graphical way of installing fonts in 11.10/Gnome 3 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install fonts? \n\nWhen testing 11.10, I wanted to install some fonts.

For keys for other GPG Keyservers, you'll need to find the locations of those keys in their respective keyserver, then use addgpg-apt with the --keyserver flag for each:  \naddgpg-apt --keyserver <keyserver> <keyid>\n\nThat will then take the keys and place them into your APT keyring.\nThe addgpg-apt program is available via PPA\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do you use them?\nIf the first command fails, try this one:\nsudo apt-get update | grep \"NO_PUBKEY\" | awk '{ print $21) }' | xargs addgpg-apt\n\nThis will perform the same action as above, only operates differently.\nGetting the Keys, Part 2\nI recommend checking the site(s) for the other non-Ubuntu and non-Launchpad repositories for the PGP keys, as they more than likely are listed there.

It is probably not RAM but I would test that first anyway to prove it isn't a problem.\nNext I would move onto the hard drive. You could try the diagnostics on the Ultimate Boot CD. There is a tool for most brands of hard drive. The other thing I would recommend is to try a different hard drive in your machine. Also changing USB cables if this is a desktop machine.\nHopefully at some point during this process you isolated the problem. If not then I think it is probably a software issue not hardware.\n", "Q: \"df -h\" command puts line breaks in output. How do I fix?

When I'm on the battery power the mouse cuts in and out, I have full battery power so it's not because of low power. It never does this in Windows, and in the past when I ran Karmic it never did this either, only when I reinstalled Ubuntu with Natty. As soon as I plug in the power it works perfectly fine.\n\nA: This behaviour is caused by laptop-mode-tools. While it's true that removing it completely solves the \"problem\", you may still want to keep the package on your system.\nIn order to disable the usb autosuspend feature of laptop-mode-tools for your mouse, you can insert your mouse's USBID (obtainable through lsusb) in\n/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/usb-autosuspend.conf\n\non the line\nAUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST=\"your-usb-id\"\n\nwhere your-usb-id is of the format 093a:2510 (this is my mouse).\nIf AUTOSUSPEND_USBID_BLACKLIST is already there, simply add the necessary USBID (note this will work only if AUTOSUSPEND_USE_WHITELIST is set to 0).\nFinally, reload laptop-mode-tools by executing\n# service laptop-mode reload\n\nor\n$ sudo service laptop-mode reload\n\n\nA: Make sure you don't have the laptop-mode-tools or powertop packages installed. If you do, uninstall them by running \nsudo apt-get remove --purge laptop-mode-tools powertop && apt-get autoremove\n\nThis solved the issue for me on Mint 13 on an Alienware M14x R2.\n\nA: I should note that after 11.10 that problem no longer existed for me. So the answer to this problem is just update! :D\n\nA: It seems like your computer is set to disable USB when iddle as a power saving measure.\nThis is usually suggested by powertop, but it's a very bad idea if you are using a USB mouse. This command fixes it temporally:\necho -1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/devices/yourmouse/../power/autosuspend\n\nYou need to substitute yourmouse for your mouse bus and device number, you can usually find it with:\nlsusb\n\nUnluckily this will work only until whatever the program that have changed the setting kicks on again: either at boot time, when you disconnect your computer from electricity, or whatever. You need to discover what package is changing it to resolve the issue.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and I solved it by disabling pm-powersave with\n    # pm-powersave false\n\nThen I rebooted my laptop and everything was just fine.

The reserve would be nice as well, but the first is more important.\n\nA: Not much of an answer but that answer there might still be valid. Personally, I make use of the disper indicator which makes it easy enough, plus allows me to manually disable the second monitor before playing games that don't support it or deal with it properly.\n", "Q: How to permanently hide Unity dock? I like unity, and the way it organizes applications but I don't like the dock. I would like to use Docky instead. \nIf it's possible, I don't even want to see the dock when I hit the super key. I don't even wanna see it when I open Unity launcher.\nWhile I wish this was all possible, I know this is probably impossible but it's worth a shot.\n\nA: I don't believe there is a way to replace the Unity launcher with Docky, but you can always auto-hide it and just ignore it. That seems quite annoying though.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I configure Unity?\n^That should help you with auto-hiding the launcher.\nAlternatively, you can always log into the Ubuntu Classic session, delete the bottom panel, and run Docky at startup. If you need further help with that, feel free to ask.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install advanced Compiz settings manager (type ccsm in Software Center). \n\n*Run it and find Unity plugin under Desktop category. \n\n*Customize it any way you want. To solve your problem you should set the Reveal Mode to None and Hide Launcher to Autohide. You can also disable the Key to show the launcher and install Gnome Do instead, which many find much better. \n\n\nUsing this manager you're able to customize your Ubuntu very deeply, not just the Unity behaviour. I think you'll be amazed with what you can do with it.\nI confirm that this solution still works on 11.10.\n", "Q: How to select display to record in RecordMyDesktop I have a dual monitor setup and wish to only record the 1st monitor with recordmydesktop, but I am unsure of the settings to do this via the command line.

Record My Desktop has an option to \"Select Window\" before you start to record. Maximize the Record My Desktop Window on the monitor you wish to record, click the \"Select Window\" It will grab the whole screen. Then simply minimize Record My Desktop window used for selecting that monitor You can then move the Record My Desktop Window to the other monitor if you like it out of your recording and click \"Record\" you will be on your way! \n\nA: I have 3 monitors 1,2,0 - aka(2,3,1)\nFor my system its:      \nrecordmydesktop --display=0 --width=1920 height=1080 --fps=15 --no-sound --delay=10\nrecordmydesktop --display=1 --width=1920 height=1080 --fps=15 --no-sound --delay=10\nrecordmydesktop --display=2 --width=1920 height=1080 --fps=15 --no-sound --delay=10\n\nI use display 2 - aka(monitor 3 middle)\n", "Q: Game crashes half the times I try to run it Thanks to the help of the Community I was able to install Descent:Freespace using Wine.\nNow when I try to run it, most of the times the screen turns black and the system becomes completely unresponsive. Sometimes the game loads, but the top and bottom of the game screen are covered by the Ubuntu desktop menu bars, and I can't move the mouse to the edges of the screen.\nHow do I go about fixing this?\n\nA: The best way to fix it is to ask for help from people who know Wine well. Not many users on AskUbuntu will be able to help you, so if I were you I would go to http://www.winehq.org/help/ and request help on a Wine-related site - you are much more likely find someone competent there than here.\n\nA: Firstly, Wine project has an \"application compatibility database\" and it appears that Descent:Freespace has quite good ratings there - Gold or Platinum, which means your chances of making it work are not that bad: http://www.winehq.org/search?cx=partner-pub-0971840239976722%3Aw9sqbcsxtyf&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&q=freespace&siteurl=appdb.winehq.org%2F#1030\nSecondly, when you run a command in a terminal, I bet you're getting some kind of error message there when the program crashes. Most likely you need to install some library and the error message may give you some indications of which lib is missing.\nOnce you have some ideas what is missing, there is a program called winetricks which helps you to install stuff (mfc runtime, directx etc.) - it installs original windows libs instead of their wine re-implementations - which may make things better or worse, you don't know until you try :)\nDon't be afraid to break things - all your Wine files are stored in .wine directory so if everything stop working completely you'll be able to delete this directory and wine will reset to default settings.\n", "Q: How to add a playlist onto ipod using clementine?

I want to globally move all new installations and users to the other hard drive (so instead of using the default drive, it uses another drive to load from).\nOS updates (and drivers?) can still goto the SSD. I just want this to last as long as possible.\n\nA: I think what you want is to move your /home folder to the 1Tb drive, while keeping the system files (including applications) on the fast SSD drive. \nYou can achieve that by moving the contents of your /home folder to the other drive and then adding a line to /etc/fstab which will tell the system to mount it at /home\nSo, as root, in terminal (I would do that while booted in the \"rescue mode\" or from a live cd), you need to do something like\nmv /home/* /media/disk/\nnano /etc/fstab\n\n(replace /media/disk by the path where your 1Tb drive is mounted at)\nAnd then add a line similar to\n/dev/sdb1       /home       ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro      0       1\n\n(replace /dev/sdb1 by the name of your 1Tb drive - you can see it by doing 'cat /etc/mtab', for example) \nThen you can test if it works by mounting/unmounting the /home and checking if it works:\nmount /home\nls /home # see if the contents appeared\numount /home\n\nthen reboot and enjoy\n", "Q: Where would I find the Purchased Music folder on my system?

I wanted to play media files on Banshee but it seems there is a huge problem in it. All the music gets loaded but when I select a song and press play button nothing happens. More than that when I try to play some MP3 on Movie player error pops up saying - \"Could not determine type of stream.\"\nI have already installed the updates needed to run MP3 files and other stuff. My MK5 videos are playing perfectly. Banshee gives no such errors but fails to run. What will solve my problem. Reinstalling Banshee after uninstalling or reinstalling the system updates?\nI checked whether is was something wrong with Unity. But it wasn't. Even this happens in y Gnome. Is this some kind of a bug? \n\nA: As noted in Ubuntu Community Documentation, by default, Ubuntu tries to only include completely free software means that proprietary media formats are not configured 'out of the box'. However, extra packages can be installed to play those proprietary media format.\nTo play the proprietary media format, install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package.\nYou can do it by doing one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clicking on this link.\n\n*Start the Ubuntu Software Centre, search for 'ubuntu-restricted-extras', and click on the install button.\n\n*Execute the command sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras in Terminal. \n\n", "Q: How can I get a PXE install to ask for the hostname I use a pxe install for a lab of machines, one problem I have is that the hostname is always set to 'ubuntu'. This is wrong, it should instead ask during the install what hostname should be used.\nOne hack was to set the hostname file at the end of the preseed, in the script section. But this still doesn't ask the installer.\n\nA: In your preseed file,\n# Any hostname and domain names assigned by dhcp take precedence\n# over values set here. However, setting them prevent the questions\n# from being shown\n\nd-i     netcfg/get_hostname     string hostname\nd-i     netcfg/get_domain       string domain\n\n\nA: I let the preseed go fetch the hostname from a webserver. Usually its just \"newbox-xxx\" where xxx is a random number. The PHP script on the webserver decides. This helps in automation because I can install cluster nodes easily if I know they are about to come online. Then the whole preseed comes to life if its a specialty box. For instance, I don't do much on a box named newbox-xxx but if its called hc4-xxx (hadoop cluster #4 - node xxx) then I know to allow the preseed to do customizations and then register itself with the cloudera manager.\n", "Q: Braid downloaded from humble bundle 3 is not running on 11.04 Hello fellow brothers in Linux I run Ubuntu 11.04 32bit and I need your help.

On desktop machines, the Update Manager application is able to show the details of a package upgrade in the section called \"Description of update\" in the bottom half of the screen.

So a .iso is currently downloading onto my flash drive. After that, what do I do? I'm just scared of deleting Windows 7 and all my files.\n\nA: Go to ubuntu dowload page and follow their, very clear, instructions (There is a big red button there, ``show me how''). If you want to do something a little bit more exotic tell us what you want to do.\n\nA: You're doing it a bit wrong. You shouldn't copy the ISO file to the flash drive - you need to use some program to \"burn\" that iso file to a CD or to a flash drive. Burning a CD seems to be a bit easier than preparing a flash drive - for the latter you'll need to somehow \"open\" the ISO image and extract usb-creator.exe program from there, so you'll need some software to work with ISO images anyway.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#From Windows\nThen you'll need to reboot your machine, enter BIOS setup and choose your flash drive/CD as the first boot device. Then you reboot with the usb drive/CD inserted and you get to the \"live\" ubuntu environment, from where you will be able to start the installation process. The installation process should be easy even for an inexperienced person - there are just 6 or so questions. And it won't erase your files unless you explicitly tell it to remove the Windows partition.\nHaving a backup of your important files is a good idea in any case, even if you weren't installing Ubuntu.\nAnother thing to mention - you could install VirtualBox and practice installing Ubuntu inside a virtual machine first.\nAlso, you could order a CD from ubuntu.com if you still having trouble with preparing a usb drive\n", "Q: Open irc:// links in XChat from Firefox and Chromium I want to open channels in servers specified in irc:// links in XChat, but directly pointing to XChat binary (in Firefox) did not work - the window to choose servers appears as usual. I don't know how to associate irc:// links with XChat in Chromium.\n\nA: One possible solution is to make a little script to open the irc chanel in an existing xchat, and pass that to Firefox. \nFor example - make a file in /usr/bin called xchat-firefox and put in it:\n#!/bin/bash\nxchat --existing --url=$@\n\nAdd executable permission to the script:\nsudo chmod +x xchat-firefox\n\nNow using the menu option Edit-Preferences-Applications Tab in Firefox select \"xchat-firefox\" for the \"irc\" content-type.\nsource 1 & source 2\n\nA: Fossfreedom's method works great, but it is a per-app solution. Granted, firefox/chromium is the most common use case, but it is easy to make a system-wide solution so it would automatically works for all apps automatically, with no need to configure each one.\nThe solution is to create an alternative .desktop file associating xchat with the irc:// uri scheme. This will automatically make the whole desktop (and any app) see XChat as an IRC handler.\nCopy xchat launcher so we can edit it:\ncp /usr/share/applications/xchat.desktop ./xchat-irc-handler.desktop\n\nEdit its contents, adding MimeType and NoDisplay, and replacing Exec to match this:\nExec=xchat --existing --url=%u\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/irc;\nNoDisplay=true\n\nNow install the file. This can be done for your current user only or for all users (just prepend the command with sudo):\nxdg-desktop-menu install --novendor ./xchat-irc-handler.desktop\n\nAnd that's it! You can try results immediately, in Firefox, Chromium, or any application.

Or would the best approach be to have a virtual machine that I can reset?\n\nA: I ended up going with a virtual machine and saving/restoring the state. It's works very well for my purposes at least. It's a bit slower when building a lot of stuff, but you can have multiple \"startpoints\" depending on what part of the script you're tweaking...\n\nA: One way of doing it would be to clone / backup your existing installation.

I played around with <LocalLanAccess> and <PPPExclusion> as mentioned in the Documentation (PDF)  without any mentionable success.\nOverriding /etc/resolv.conf with an appropriate config for lan and vpn lets vpanagentd consume all cpu.

They are not even installer files, just a type of archive file like .zip files.\nSoftware, normally as source code is often distributed this way though but the file should contain information telling you how to install. Look for a README or INSTALL file in the archive and follow the instructions you are given.\n\nA: Did you mean network-manager-applet-0.8.3.998.tar.bz2? That is a source package which needs to be extracted and compiled. Unless you really, really need the latest version, I recommend you installing the network-manager-gnome from the package manager. It integrates better and will be updated automatically.\nTo extract the package, you need to open a terminal and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the directory to the directory containing the .tar.bz file: cd /path/to/dir\n\n*Extract the bzip2-compressed tarball: tar xjf Manager-0.8.3.998.tar.bz2\n\n*Change the directory to the newly created directory (use ls to get the directory listing). cd network-manager-applet-0.8.3.998\n\n*Run ./configure.

Just place the shared stuff under the Ubuntu-One directory. \nIf you have different things being backed up and their sum fits within your Ubuntu-One storage limit, make two different subdirectories under the Ubuntu-One dir and use the correct one from each machine.\nDoes that cover your question? or, are you asking something different?\n\nA: You can have several different folders synchronized, independent of the Ubuntu One-folder.

Sorry to not have a fix for you. Just wanted to say you are not alone.\nI'll just wait till all the kinks are worked out.\n\nA: Each installation of Ubuntu will create its own Grub2 menu which will be put in the MBR overwriting the Grub2 menus of the other Ubuntus in their partitions.\nSo, decide which Ubuntu will be your standard, working Ubuntu and only run sudo update-grub2 on that installation. Have Grub Customizer installed on your standard, working Ubuntu and use the File menu, Install to MBR option.\nKernel updates on the other Ubuntus will generate a new Grub2 menu. So, do your standard, working Ubuntu kernel update last and use Grub Customizer to restore your modified Grub menu back into the MBR. It works for me.\nRegards.\n\nA: I am unsure with Ubuntu Studio, but with Ubuntu you need to edit the default config file:\n\n/etc/default/grub\n\nThis file then updates /boot/grub/grub.cfg when you run:\n\nupdate-grub\n\n", "Q: How do I re-install Network Manager without an internet connection? I have only wireless connection, one computer with a connection and 4gb usb . \nMy second computer has no network connection, because I have deleted it from the software center. However, now I want to re-install it. How can I do that?\n\nA: In case you only removed just Network Manager with the Software Center it is quite easy to reinstall by downloading only 2 packages from another machine connected to the internet:\n\n*\n\n*Use packages.ubuntu.com, download the network-manager package from a software mirror close to you. Take care to choose the appropriate architecture (amd64 for 64-bit, i386 for 32-bit), and release version of your installed OS.\n\n*Download network-manager-gnome package likewise (amd64 or i386).\n\n*Copy both files on your spare USB drive and take it to the broken machine.\n(e.g. network-manager-gnome_0.8xxx.deb and network-manager_0.8xxx.deb)\n\n*Install network-manager and network-manager-gnome simply by double-clicking on these two .deb files. This opens the Ubuntu Software Center or Gdebi for reinstallation.\n\n*After a rebooting (or just logging out and logging back in) the network manager will run and use your previous settings as before.\n\nNote: This was not tested for the case when network-manager was removed in other ways, and if other applications were removed that may have deleted additional dependencies.\n\nA: The following describes how to establish a wireless network connection via command line utilities.\nI think this is a better option because it gives you the useful ability to interface with relevant command line utilities. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use ifconfig -a to identify your wireless card. From hence forward, I will assume it's eth1.\n\n*sudo ifconfig eth1 up\n\n*iwlist eth1 scan to find available networks. iwlist eth1 scan | less if it's a long list.\n\n*sudo iwconfig eth1 essid [network] [key [pass]] Also, read man iwconfig to figure out how the wifi password is entered. You might also need to configure the channel and stuff.\n\n*\n\n*If you use WPA, wpa_supplicant will be necessary. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263136\n\n\n*sudo dhclient eth1\n\nA: I had the same problem. I was on one and only computer - off-line and could not re-install Network manager. However, booting up in the root screen allowed an internet connection. I still could not install the network manager, but I was able to apt-get install wicd. \nAfter doing that, I booted up again, this time to the GNOME window GUI and wicd was there in the applications. It sets up internet connection as does NetworkManager. But to be extra safe, I then installed network manager again since I was back online and able to do so. I have both now and feel more secure. \nThe first time a power line crash removed network manger and left me offline, I had to do a complete new installation as I did not know about wicd. I'm glad to have learned of it this time, and glad it is easy to install from the root directory.\n\nA: I have never done it, but my understanding is that you can enable the cd as a repository from in the software centre\n\n\n", "Q: External USB HDD Unreadable After Formatting I am using a Western Digital 160GB External USB drive.\nIt was working fine earlier but for some reasons I formatted it using the 'Disk Utility' in my Ubuntu 11.04\nI chose 'Dont Partition' while formatting it.

I also used 'Master Boot' formatting after that but to no avail.\nNow I can still see it being detected in my 'Disk Utility' but its not being readable.\nI am using an aspire acer one netbook.\nPlease help.\n\nA: By formatting a drive, you are essentially erasing all data boundaries (\"partritions\") on the drive, which in turn causes your data to no longer be usable.\nIn all likelihood, you erased the drive's partitions (and thus its data in the most rudimentary sense), but did not create storage space on the drive in the form of a partition.\nOpen up gparted.  (If it doesn't exist on your system, install it with sudo apt-get install gparted.)  Find the drive in the devices dropdown in gparted, and see it says \"Free Space\" or \"Unpartitioned Space\".  You will need to create a partition there.  If that is the case, make sure that you create a partition that is readable on both systems (i.e. if one system is Windows and your netbook is Linux, then make an NTFS partition).\nThen after that is complete, try using the drive on the other system, and see if it is readable.\n", "Q: KVM does not recognize restart call from guest OS I am installing Windows XP directly using KVM:\nkvm -m 256 -hda XP.img -cdrom XP\\ DISK\\ IMAGE.iso -boot d -smp 1\n\nAfter formatting and initial round of copying files, it remains in the screen saying it's restarting.

I have to physically unplug and re-plug the mouse in order for it to work again.\n\nA: That might be because of the port you are using. I heard that some ports are supposed to be reserved for keyboard/mouse. If you use a different port, like the one at the back instead of the front), this may help. I know that Windows has issues if I change the mouse to another port while it runs. and if I change to another port, it may not be detected at all as Windows starts, although Ubuntu will detect it no problem.\nBTW: Try to avoid hubs for keyboard and mouse. \n\nA: On motherboards Asus M2N I've found that this problem is corrected on BIOS by turning usb to auto mode, by default it is enabled. Anyway, some usb HDD attached on PC, may make this way your PC takes too much time (some seconds more) during bootup of system.\n\nA: I found another solution other than replugging the USB mouse. At boot enter your BIOS setup and look for an Integrated Peripherals section. It's counter intuitive, but worked for me. I disabled the USB mouse support entry.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a PPA that's designed for your version of Ubuntu, versus using a \"normal\" package, but one designed for a different version of Ubuntu?\nBackground: We'll soon be installing Lucid Lynx, and Lucid's Ruby1.9.1 package is based on Ruby 1.9.1-376. There are PPAs that have Ruby 1.9.2 and are designed for Lucid. And later releases of Ubuntu have packages that are based on Ruby 1.9.2  (but the package is still called Ruby 1.9.1 for perfectly logical reasons). What factors should I consider in deciding whether to use a PPA, or a package designed for a different Ubuntu version?\n(I'm not anticipating using RVM or installing from source, because we want admin to be as risk-free as possible)\n\nA: \"(I'm not anticipating using RVM or installing from source, because we want admin to be as risk-free as possible)\"\nFirst off, whenever you use a package from a different version of ubuntu.. or a PPA version, you risk severely complicating your dpkg database because it's dependencies may require upgrades as well (according to dpkg, at least)\nThe PPA is a much safer approach because it's made for lucid and therefore should be built on dependencies available in lucid.\nInstalling from source or RVM is actually an even safer approach because it allows you to install outside of your dpkg database. This is what I've preferred doing in the past.\nI am not sure what risk you think comes with installing from source, but from my experience.. there isn't any. The only problem is that it's not managed by a package manager and will not automatically update or uninstall. But this is actually what we want in this case.\nEDIT: I guess the risk is that someone might be incompetent and forget to document what they installed, etc. Just make sure you do the following-\n\n\n*\n\n*Document what you installed.\n\n*Keep the source files in a directory in case you wish to do a make uninstall\nI usually just keep a \"installed\" directory with all the source trees I have compiled and installed. That's enough documentation for me.\n", "Q: Totem (movie player) quits on suspend When I have a active window of movie player and suspend, then movie player quits.\nHere is the setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*the window is seen on my screen.\n\n*it doesn't matter if the video is or isn't playing.\n\n*it's not a specific video or format.\n\n\nHow can I make movie player stop quitting? \nMy laptop is an Asus 1201n\nThis is what happend when I played a movie, suspended, and when it woke up (10 seconds after) the laptop froze. That's why I had to take a picture with my iPhone instead of a screenshot.\n\n\nA: From what your application is telling you (and from your hardware), it is probably that Totem/gstreamer runs out of memory when the system resumes from sleep (that is, it hits a point where it uses too much memory and is closed). I have experienced this problem with another netbook myself, and the reason behind it is simply that certain applications require large amounts of memory, but cannot get enough from the netbook's mediocre hardware without interfering with the stability of the system, and thus the applications are closed.\nYou would be surprised to know that games work just fine (you know this already as you have said), because of how they use the hardware. Instead of keeping a hold of large amounts of memory at a time, games often unload what they don't need to display at the time, and it is just that they do it \"fast enough\" that you don't notice lag.\nVideo players however (especially those without hardware acceleration) will run into problems as they not only dig through CPU cycles, but memory, which is required for seeking etc. Totem usually does a good job with video, but because of the way it uses memory, (gstreamer's fault) it doesn't do too well in situations where the memory is limited.\nYou can use the option to remember the video position in Totem, or try using VLC and enabling hardware acceleration :). Either way, it is not a good practice to suspend with a video player loaded, as it will take a lot of power to keep all of that memory fresh while you are on battery power and moving a system. Heavy consistent loads like that can actually shorten battery life (I killed a battery like that :).\n/rant off, and I hope that answers your questions :).\n", "Q: Does the GN-WS50G-RH wireless card work in Ubuntu?

Or find another employer. ;-)\n\nA: I'd personally recommend nvidia cards for their Twinview but you're extremely limited in what you can buy for AGP. The 6800 GT is probably the best card you can get fulfilling your requirements. Helpfully it's also supported by the current driver. I can't say how long it'll be until Nvidia stops supporting it but it's probably quite soon.\nJust to make things even more annoying, AGP Nvidia cards are at that point in their life cycle where they're becoming more expensive than they should be, just because they're so rare. Damn you, market forces!\nIt seems odd to say it but binning the old computers is probably the best long-term plan in terms of price, performance and support rather than spending £50 per card for technology that is 8 generations old and might not be supported in the future.\nIf you need to evaluate it, you need to evaluate it. Buy one, chuck it in one of your machines and give it a spin. If it doesn't work, you've only lost £50 and the 20 minutes or so it takes to throw it in and test.\nAlternatively there are devices like the Matrox DualHead2Go and TripleHead2Go that combine two screens into something the system sees as one monitor.

Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm still a newb, tried Ubuntu last year), but I made a fresh install of Natty. Is there an Ubuntu site where it has the *.deb files of restricted plugins? i.e. gstreamer, freepats, and the like for a specific Ubuntu distro. My net speed sucks most of the time, just for backups or something.\n\nA: Basically most of the retricted packages are on ubuntu repository. Just search for your package on http://packages.ubuntu.com/. There are some additional media packages not found in main repository here: http://medibuntu.org/. As for backup, the installed packages that were installed with apt stay on /var/cache/apt/archives You may backup that on any external device or somewhere else so that you can reuse it later.  \n\nA: Yes, http://packages.ubuntu.com . Choose your Ubuntu version, search the package, then on the right choose your download.\n\nA: Probably in the launchpad repository: http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty .\nJust search the package you would like to install and download it.\nIf you would like to use gstreamer, I advice you to add this medibuntu repository, please see here : http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/medibuntu . To easely install repository and application, install ubuntutweak : http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-tweak  .\n\nA: The apt is not the only tool which store installed (actually downloaded) debs in /var/cache/apt/archives, but also  synaptic and Software-Center. Just a clarification. \nBut if you want to install these packages later, you should setup a local-repository, so that you do not need to download these debs again. \nYou can get details about creating a personal repository here. \nIt is fine, if you do not stay connected to the Internet. But the problem with this method is  - it is not trusted. So if you want to install a package which resides both on your untrusted 'personal repository' and also on a trusted repository on the Internet, the package manager(apt or synaptic) will try to download the packages from trusted one (from Internet). So you may want to setup a local trusted repository. You can create a trusted repository by following this guide. \nIf it seems to you a clumsy method, you can force to install from your untrusted local repository by using --allow-unauthenticated switch to apt-get or change the preference of synaptic.\napt-get method\nsudo apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install your_package_name\nsynaptic method\nwhen you check some package to install and click on Apply button, synaptic will warn you that the packages are not authenticated and ask 'are you want to continue?'. just say OK to this answer. \n", "Q: How can I get video working properly on my Shuttle ss30g2?

On the keyboard it has a numberpad on some of the letters which you press the Fn button to use. The system is acting like I have the Fn key pressed and I get numbers shown when it should be letters. If I press the Fn key the numbers go to letters. The Fn key is not stuck down. Is there a way to reset keyboard settings or a known fix. The operating system is Ubuntu 11.04 Natty.\n\nA: On samsung laptop, there are \"Fn Lock\" button on right-top of the keyboard so that it fixed.\n\nA: The Fn key is generally handled via the ACPI BIOS rather than directly by the operating system, so there is unlikely to be anything that Ubuntu itself can do.\nOne possibility is that you've turned on the NumLock, which might cause those keys to default to numbers instead of letters.  Hitting the key (or key combo: on my laptop Number Lock is toggled by the Fn+ScrLk key combo) again should set things back to normal.\nIf that doesn't work, restarting the system will probably return it to the default state.\n\nA: Had the same issue with DELL Inspiron 15 5000 Series :\nSolution is to press Fn+Esc.\n\nA: On Asus Zen Book the magic key combination is FN+Insert.\n\nA: For me, I had only to press Fn with F11. This combination enable/disable the num lock in notebook keyboard!\nOtherwise you can try another combination in your keyboard to enable/disable num lock.\n\nA: I found that the Num Lock is the issue here. I had the same issue, and I turned off num lock and it worked fine for me after. It's because that's what registers as a normal number pad, and instead of hitting Fn, num lock automatically replaces the Fn key. \nIts a derp, but fixable easily. \n\nA: I was having trouble with this.. Turns out there was a Fn-lock-button on my keyboard up by F12... silly me missed it.\n\nA: I just found out that there is \"Fn Lock\" key on my samsung laptop. And I pushed this key by mistake and it was react exactly like you described.\nSo, if you have this key, just press on it one more time and it will be fixed.\n\nA: My laptop (Asus EEE 10\") had this exact problem; pressing the numlock key (which required the fn key in this case) fixed it.\nThe interesting thing though, is that before I figured it out, the problem persisted after reboots, but only happened in her user. So apparently Ubuntu saves the numlock state (per user) across reboots. It's an old version (10.04) so I don't know if this is still the case. \n\nA: I had this issue to on my laptop. It seems that pressing Fn+Num Lk on my keyboard locks the Fn key as pressed (pressing it makes it act as unpressed). I was probably hitting Fn+Num Lk accidentally due to the ackward keyboard layout of the laptop.\n", "Q: How to share an Internet connection over Bluetooth from the Phone to the PC I am on vacation and have a phone (N900) with an Internet connection. I have no Internet connection for my laptop. I'd like to connect the phone and laptop over Bluetooth (second choice: per USB cable) and share the connection with the laptop. I seem to remember that I was offered such a sharing the first time I connected the devices, but now I unpaired and paired them again and can't get this window to show again. Any ideas how to set it up? Google only shows hits for the other way round (the Ubuntu PC has the Internet). \nSorry if the question has been asked before, the search function does not work with the phone. \n\nA: It turned out that the connection sharing has to be enabled on the phone. I installed an app on the phone which shares the connection (for the N900, it is called bluetooth-dun) and on the new pairing, Ubuntu automatically offered to use the phone's Internet connection.

Quoting from the HOWTO.hooks file in pm-utils:\n\nHow to write a pm-utils hook:\nPARAMETERS\nA pm-utils hook is simply an executable file that accepts at least one \n  parameter. \nFor hooks in power.d, the potential values of that parameter are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*true -- the hook MUST perform whatever action is appropriate when the system \n      transitions TO battery power.\n  \n*false -- The hook MUST perform whatever action is appropriate when the system\n      transitions FROM battery power.\n  \n\nYou might also want to read some of the existing power hooks in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d for ideas about how to structure your script.\nNote that if you use the pm-utils interface, you'll be told whether you're on AC power or not through the first argument: if $1 is true, then you're switching to battery power, and if it is false then you're switching back to mains power.\n\nA: I achieve the similar goal by using acpi.\nuse /usr/bin/acpi_listen to catch the acpi event you want, on my lapttop, the event that fire when switch to battery is \"ac_adapter ACPI0003:00 00000080 00000000\".\nso I create a new event : /etc/acpi/events/switch-to-battery, below is the content:\nevent=ac_adapter ACPI0003:00 00000080 00000000\naction=/etc/acpi/switch-to-battery.sh\n\nJust do whatever you want in ac_adapter.sh.

Or rather, it stops all the time. The pattern goes like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy really fast for like 2 seconds\n\n*Stop for approximately 18 seconds with no bits transferred (this is what I want to get rid of)\n\n*Repeat from 1.\n\n\nIt is not the server: I can access NFS quickly from several other machines in the network.\nIt is not the network: See above. The one problematic machine is connected with a cable, so it's all good.\nIt is not the hardware in the problematic machine: I had Ubuntu 11.04 x86 installed, and then NFS worked well. The problem has appeared after I installed Ubuntu 11.04 x86-64. (I don't know what causes it, but as I say; it worked before. Now it doesn't)\nIt is not the mount options: I copied the relevant line in fstab from the x86-installation. I have also tried altering the mount options to no avail.\nI can't see anything relevant-looking in dmesg or syslog.\nI don't really know how to continue debugging this. What can cause nfs to behave like this? What tools can I use to determine what is causing the lock/stop? Help? :)\n\nA: It was the network after all. I had stretched and bent the freaking network cable in such a way that the autonegotiation made the network speed 10Mb/s, half duplex. This I discovered with ethtool eth0.\nThe apparent stops I think must have been due to some buffering somewhere. When I looked closer it appeard that the copying was just really slow. I looked closer by enabling nfs logging to syslog with sudo sysctl -w sunrpc.nfs_debug=1023.\nHow about that?\n", "Q: Can you mount SMB shares in Kubuntu like in Ubuntu? I have just installed Kubuntu, and I notice that Dolphin tries to access SMB shares using libsmbclient instead of mounting an SMB location like I am used to in Nautilus. Unfortunately, the performance is horrendous, and for some reason, I am unable to access shares that I could access in Nautilus (it gives me authorization issues which I didn't have in the SMB mounts).\nIs there a way to mount SMB shares in Kubuntu as in Ubuntu?\n(Note: I am accessing the share over a VPN, in case that makes a difference, but I don't see why it should, and in Nautilus the performance was completely accetable).\n\nA: Try using command line tools like smbmount. This will mount the dir, KDE or Gnome , you will always be able to mount. Eventually you can put it into /etc/fstab, but when starting up without network or connected to another network the mount will not succeed. \n\nA: Possible solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create /media/MOUNTPOINT\n\n*Install cifs-tools package\n\n*Add to fstab the line:\n//IP_SAMBA_SERVER/SHARE /media/MOUNTPOUNT cifs user,noauto,user=smb_username,password=smbpasswd 0 0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After that, it will appear a new icon in Dolphin with MOUNTPOINT name. By clicking on it, it will mount the SMB share.\n\n*NOTE: For security reasons, may be better to use the option \"credentials\" instead user & password. Check man mount.cifs to learn how to use it.\n\n\n\nA: The Dolphin, and Konqueror file manager/browsers both support cifs.  Just input smb://my_windows_server/my_share_name/  or smb://myuser@my_windows_server/my_share_name/ in the url field.  With dolphin the bar is hidden, but you can open it by clicking on network in the side bar or clicking after the icon for your current location.\nPS - Smbmount is not really used in modern linux systems.  If you want to mount the filesystem the example using cifs tools is more likely to work.\n\nA: This question is old but the problem still applies to users who have the same problem with the current kUbuntu 14.04 LTS.\nYou can use Smb4k\n\nI did the following in a fresh install of kUbuntu 14.04.4 LTS\nsudo apt-get install smb4k\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to application launcher and type smb4k, then click or enter to run.\n\n*Click on the tab at the bottom left that says “Network Neighborhood”\n\n*Browse for your network shares (Windows, smb/samba, etc).

After getting Ubuntu setup on my Macbook Pro with Gnome Shell, there is one little thing irritating me:\nI have an external monitor connected which is set as primary in the Nvidia control panel. I'd like that if the lid of the Macbook is closed, the internal display is disabled completely, if it's opened, it enables twinview.\nI've found the configuration settings for lid closing in Gnome Tweak Tool, but the best I can make it do is blank the screen, but that still means my desktop extends onto the Macbook. \n\nA: Not sure if your problem is Macbook specific. If it isn't, you can just go to power settings, and specify the Do nothing option when the lid is closed.\nThen you can open Displays, and turn your laptop screen off. See below:\n\n\nA: I had this same problem on my 6.2 MBP. It has an nVidia card. If your using an ATI model then I am not sure. \nFirst reset your NVRAM and SMC just to make sure your not having issues left from installing or setting from OS X, or anything like that. Keep in mind that neither of those should be done too often, but once in a while doesn't hurt, and because linux doesn't \"store\" any of it's configuration there it should be fine. Remember OS X will have some settings reset. \nNext make sure you install nvidia-experimental-304 or better. Earlier versions did not detect monitor hot plugs over the display port (for me).\nRemember that all the \"Mac\" rules still apply. You can not close your lid on battery and have the laptop stay on, no matter what you do. \nNow for configuration.  Go to System Setting then power management and make sure to disable suspend when lid is closed and on power. Might as well leave it active on battery as nothing is going to stop that. \nNow make sure you have a keyboard attached and close your lid. Your laptop screen will go black as will your external monitor. Press a button and your monitor will go on (this is a hardware feature OS X does this as well).\n\nA: Just go to your \"Dash Home,\" type in \"Displays\", click on \"Displays\" icon , then select the display which you want to use.

Having just upgraded from 10.04 to 11.04, I'm getting used to the Unity interface.\nBack in Gnome, I managed to create a \"common\" menu accessible from the start button to which I could simply add *.desktop files to get all my common things in there?\nIs there a way to do this in Unity? What I'm looking for is a single icon in the launcher which, when clicked, gives me a menu which can start my most common applications like:\n\n\n*\n\n*firefox.\n\n*thunderbird.\n\n*a couple of different VMWare images.\n\n*a couple of common directories (nautilus file manager).\n\n*a maximised terminal.\n\n*my backup script.\n\n*brasero, gcalctool, eclipse and others.\n\n\nThe idea of putting all my apps in the launcher is not too appealing to me since it may expand beyond the screen height, even with my reduced icon size.\nBy judicious use of the desktop files (some standard, some self-made), I managed to get all this going in Gnome but I'm having troubles figuring out the new setup.\nIn addition, the icons for all my VMWare images are identical in the Unity launcher whereas Gnome allowed textual descriptions. Can this be changed at the top level or, preferably, in the sub-menu I'm looking for?\n\nA: It's fairly easy to add entries to the right-click menu for launcher tiles and I know it's been answered here somewhere, but I couldn't find it. But these are the basic steps: \nLook for a string similar to this one in a desktop-file for the tile you wish to edit: \nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow;\nIf you can't find it, create it. For each shortcut, add the following: \n[pick_a_name Shortcut Group]\nName=pick_a_name\nExec=command to execute\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nAdd each group you add to the X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts string, separated by semicolons. For instance, if you want to add web shortcuts to the Firefox icon (you should already have the NewWindow group defined, and it's a long entry so I'm omitting it):\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow;Xkcd;Google;AskUbuntu;\n\n[xkcd Shortcut Group]\nName=xkcd\nExec=firefox --new-tab http://www.xkcd.com\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Google Shortcut Group]\nName=Google\nExec=firefox --new-tab http://www.google.com\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[AskUbuntu Shortcut Group]\nName=AskUbuntu\nExec=firefox --new-tab \"http://www.askubuntu.com\"\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nI don't remember if you have to log out and back in for the changes to work.

If I put a second 320GB hard drive into the computer, can I make the second drive mirror the first using Linux software RAID1 or something similar? I tried adding a new RAID array in the Gnome Disk Utility, but it only gave me the option of creating an array with two empty partitions.\n\nA: Firstly, you should backup your data just in case.\nAlso, make sure you read the steps carefully and know exactly what you're doing. I have never done this before, I just extracted the steps from some forum posts.\n\n\n*\n\n*With fdisk, create a new partition of type fd on your new drive, sdb.\n\n*Create a degraded RAID1 array: mdadm -C /dev/md0 --force --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 missing\n\n*Create a file system on /dev/md0: mkfs -t ext4 /dev/md0\n\n*Now, /dev/md0 is currently a degraded raid1 with two drives, but one is missing.\n\n*do a full copy from sda1 to md0, dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/md0\n\n*Mount /dev/md0 and inspect.\n\n\nOk, at this point you should have a raid1 with all the correct information.

Now, get the system up and running with md0 alone. \nOnce you have the computer fully operational without drive0 connected, turn it off again, and reattach sda.\n\n\n*\n\n*With fdisk, repartition /dev/sda with a partition of type fd.\n\n*Add /dev/sda1 to your existing RAID1 array: mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda1\n\n*Done!.

To mirror an existing lv on a new drive using lvm2:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the new drive and create lvm2 partition(s) (at least the same size as your existing drive's lvm partition(s), or those you want to mirror in any case) (use parted /dev/newdrive or use sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb assuming sdb is your new drive)\n\n*initialise new partition(s) as lvm2 pv(s) (pvcreate /dev/newpartition)\n\n*extend your existing lvm2 vg(s) to the new partition(s) (vgextend /dev/myvg /dev/newpartition) and then first check and confirm that the number of extents on the new drive is the same or more (pvdisplay) Free PE on new drive should be more than Total PE of the old drive.\n\n*for each lv that you want to mirror on the new partition:\nlvconvert -m1 /dev/myvg/existinglv /dev/newpartition\n\n(ie, convert my existing (linear) lv to a raid1 mirrored lv with 1 additional mirror leg, and allocate the new PEs required for the mirror leg on the given new pv/partition)\n\n*note that you will need some additional space on the existing and new lv, because lvm2 raid1 mirror segments (the default) store their logs on the same pv/segment as the mirror leg (you will need an additional 1 PE per mirror leg on both the existing and new pv).\nIf you get an error like 1 extents needed, but only 0 available then it might indicate a problem creating the log, and you might need to create some free space on the existing pv, possibly by shrinking the relevant lv to allow room (lvreduce).  If you do this, you might need to resize the underlying filesystem beforehand (resize2fs)).\n\nA: I achieved this by backing up all of my data onto an external drive, reinstalling Ubuntu onto a raid array, and then restoring my backup in the new file system. In particular, I followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup data using instructions at this forum thread using command\nsudo tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=backup.tgz --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/dev --exclude=/etc/fstab --exclude=/etc/mtab --exclude=/boot --exclude=/media /\n\nreplacing backup.tgz in both cases with the location of the backup\n\n*Turn computer off and install two hard drives with the smaller one being at least the size of the raid array (possibly including the original hard drive)\n\n*Boot into install disk and run the installer.\n\n*Using manual partitioning, make a partition in each hard drive for each partition in the final file system. For example, if you want your /home partition to be 100 GB, make a 100GB partition in each hard drive. Set all partitions that will be part of a RAID array to RAID autodetect (0xfd).\n\n*Choose to make raid arrays, and put each partition into a raid array with the corresponding partition on the other disk.\n\n*Finish the installation as normal and reboot into the fresh Ubuntu installation.\n\n*Mount the external drive if it is not already mounted and restore the backup as described in the forum thread above using the command\nsudo tar xvpfz backup.tgz -C /\n\n\n*Run sudo update-grub and then reboot. The new operating system should now be exactly like the original.\nI prefer this method for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making file system level copies instead of disk level copies seems preferable in general\n\n*It does not depend on keeping the partition structure the same\n\n*Once I figured out how to do it, the entire process took less time than the disk level copy took\n\n*It allows the installer to create the correct entries for boot devices and mounted devices, which need to change because raid partitions are referred to differently than regular partitions are.\n", "Q: unable to create new launcher I cannot create a new launcher anywhere (either in the normal GNOME desktop or Unity). \nNo action when I right-click the desktop and select Create Launcher....\nAt last I tried to create launcher, and I got the following error message:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/alacarte/Alacarte/MainWindow.py\", line 312, in on_new_item_button_clicked\n    process = subprocess.Popen(['gnome-desktop-item-edit', file_path], env=os.environ)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py\", line 672, in __init__\n    errread, errwrite)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py\", line 1213, in _execute_child\n    raise child_exception\nOSError: [Errno 2] Directory or file does not exist.\n\nWhat is wrong?\n\nA: As you yourself stated in a comment, the solution is to install gnome-panel\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel should do the trick.\n", "Q: How could i add an Applications Option to the left Nautilus pane like Finder on OSX or PCMANFM?

Is the Google Music Manager Beta for Linux considered an open source program?\n\nA: Just using common sense and 2 minutes of googling, you can infer the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google doesn't even let you download the software before you've signed up. You have to go looking for it on filehosting services, or know about the direct link (here). If it were open source, everyone would be free to distribute it, and you would likely see many more mirrors just from googling 'Google Music deb'.\n\n*So I downloaded the files, both the Linux and Windows version, and tried to crack open whatever files I could, but I couldn't find any license files in plaintext. What I could find was a list of third-party software that Google had to declare they used. It's all Apache/MIT/BSD/LGPL-ed; no copylefted stuff. Coincidence? Hm ...\n\n*Google is already toeing the line with this project, as record labels never like the thought of blanket license agreements. Google knows well what a trouble Youtube is (have you ever tried accessing music videos from, say, Germany?), and there's a reason it's limited to the US for now. It's not because Google managers are nationalists, I can tell you that much. At any rate, this is a case where they might think that security by obscurity is a way to at least keep people from reverse-engineering and causing legal trouble.\n\n*(Edit: Afterthought) The libre-software enthusiast that I am, I have to concede that Google would gain very little by releasing the source in this case. In fact, the service may rely on some storage-and-search systems that they would rather keep to themselves, and that may matter more than the couple community contributions that may or may not come in.\nBut then I found this blog post by a guy who published the EULA. That should clear things up.\n", "Q: FULL install Ubuntu on 4GB USB drive Is there a way to full install Ubuntu 11.04 in a 4gb USB drive?\nIt says that I need at least a 4.6 GB drive. I want the full install, not the live persistent installation. I think that it don't need to use 4.6 GB, I just want a basic installation that is not like a live CD/persistent\n\nA: Do the installation using the 'Alternate' version of Ubuntu and not the 'LiveCD'. Installation from a LiveCD really does require about 4.6Gb of space to do the installation, even though a fresh installation of Ubuntu does take up less than 4Gb.\nThe text-based Alternate installer will do it all in something like 3.5Gb so there'll be no disk space issues during the installation. I've done this a few times before with 4Gb flash drives so can verify that it works fine this way. You'll need to download an Ubuntu Alternate .iso image from here : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download\nThe text-based installer can be a bit daunting the first time, so check this guide to get an idea of what you're in for : http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/minimal\n\nA: OK, this is what i did to run Xubuntu From a SD card it applies to USB sticks too it's really simple actually , though i used only (x)Ubuntu, i'm prety sure it works for other Distro's, not so sure if it will work using Windows.\nFirst we need 2 USB sticks, one for the liveCD's and the other to install the OS.\nSince you want multiple OS's in it, you should use a 16 or 32 GB USB stick, if possible use a USB 3.0 because transfer rates from a 2.0 device are quite slow, eg. i used a 8GB class 2 SD card to install Xubuntu, and it while it wasn't crawling, it didn't fly, though SD cards are slower than USB, for the livecd you can use a 1 or 2 GB drive.\nOk, now make a liveUSB bootable drive, i recommend you to use UNetbootiN, to do this, pick the iso and create the liveUSB.\nNow, that you have the bootable USB, reboot your PC and start the liveUSB, once you're in there start the live session.\nOnce you're in connect the second USB to the PC and format it to EXT4, then simply point the installer to the USB drive and that's it ( i went a little on the extreme side, and disconnected all of my Hard drives to avoid grub being insalled on them or messing the existing installations).\nAdding more distro's is just a matter of creating more partitions, though i don't know if USB's just as Regular Hard Drives , can only hold up to a certain number of Extended partitions, though you can share the /home, swap, i don't really know if /boot can be shared too or if it's safe to do so.\nAs to adding Windows to the USB device, maybe JUST maybe, if you create an NTFS partition and install \n\nA: Also, be aware that you'll need to do a lot of regular 'house cleaning' to keep the drive from filling up. The package cache alone can grow to several GB if left alone. It would be worth your time to install BleachBit and regularly clean out what isn't needed, for both the user and root account. I've imaged almost 150 linux drives this year for students and running out of space is one of the most common issues.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible, I was trying to do it on Ubuntu 13.10. At first it wrote, that I need more than 5.9 GB of free space. And until you do not have enough space, installation do not allow you to continue.\nSolution :\nInsert one more USB key which is bigger or (size of this temporary USB and your first USB)>than installation requires. So, installation will allow you to continue, and choose, manual partitioning, and simply do not use your second (temp) USB. With this solution I get Ubuntu 13.10 to 4GB SD card. And it works pretty well.\n\nA: NO 4GB is a bit too small.When you start installation on first step UBUNTU will tell you that at least 5GB required. So, minimum is 8GB. \nI did it with 8GB then it fits in. 4GB for base,3GB\nfor home and rest to SWAP. You can make partitions using GPARTED. which is included in\nLIVECD. \nAfter doing this if you chk with windows.my computer screen see your pendrive blue..\nDont worry .Start installation and keep in mind. USB 2.0 is a bit slow.\nI suggest you to use USB 3.0 fast pendrive if your PC has it than it is fast.\n", "Q: OpenSource Driver with ATI HD 6770 Im currently using fglrx from AMD and wanna try other driver to see if I can get better performance with compiz (I'm getting flickering). Everything I've tried dont works(Radeon, RadeonHD), I think that 6770 is too new; But wait! 6770 is almost identical to 5770! Any idea? I have ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: Go to CCSM (compiz Configuration Settings Manager) then go to the OpenGL plug in and then uncheck Sync to Vblank. Then go back and on the Composite plug in uncheck Detect Refresh Rate \n\nA: It is unlikely you will get better performance with the open-source driver. Fglrx is much more efficient, so it will result in smoother graphics, more FPS in games etc. There are some exceptions, though, the open-source driver supports KMS while fglrx not, so with fglrx you will not get a pretty ubuntu logo while booting-up your system.\n\nA: The open driver has improved significantly over a very short time. If you want to get a feel of how it's progressing, then you might want to fire up Oneiric Alpha 3 and run it live. My experience is that the driver in Oneiric is much better than the one in Natty. Other issues with Oneiric forced me back to Natty, but the improvements in graphics alone makes me want to upgrade as early as I can. \n", "Q: Running services Is there a way to get precise list of services with \"is running\"/\"is not running\" statuses specified.\nservice --status-all\n\noutputs more than 30 ? services.\nWhy is that output is so not informative?

I've read on some other question that it is possible that -llua has some other name and that I should fix it. But the problem is that I can't seem to find the lua.o or whatever it is called.\n\nA: gcc … -llua looks for a file called liblua.so if you're linking dynamically (the default) or liblua.a if you're linking statically.\nYou can look for the package(s) containing a file by a certain name with apt-file . You can also make this search online on packages.ubuntu.com (“Search the contents of package”, be sure to select your distribution and architecture). But…\n$ apt-file search liblua.so\n$\n\nWhat's going on is that Ubuntu ships multiple versions of the Lua libraries, and they aren't binary compatible, i.e. you need to select the one you want at build time.\n$ apt-file --regexp search '/liblua.*\\.so$'\n<lots of hits>\n\nAs of natty, the preferred version of Lua is 5.1, with 5.0 and 4.0 also available. The corresponding lua libraries for linking are liblua5.1.so, liblua50.so and liblua40.so (you can list the files in a package with dpkg -L liblua5.1-0-dev or apt-file list liblua5.1-0-dev).

I've looked at the ini (ignore_default) file, and checked the files names to make sure that they don't match.\n\n*Files/Directories disappearing ... could be connected to the conflict problem but whole directory trees just disappear! I have now started to keep a local copy of everything in the U1 directory, 'just in case'.

I would like this and I want it to work, but I've ignored it for now as it's Beta.  I have tried it but all these problems occurred without the Windows client involved. Ultimately a working reliable Windows client is a must-have but I know that this is a 'Work in Progress' and 'don't run before you can walk' applies.\nAny advice or thoughts about my problems would be gratefully received.\nAs a normal user I would have thought that DropBox users are a target audience for U1 and I, for one, would love to stop using DropBox.

There is no point in burying our heads in the sand and repeating the Mantra 'UbuntuOne is great', if it isn't. \nAs an example some people I know, new to this file syncing, just don't trust it and don't use it -- bring out the old USB stick is their response.  Having had this negative attitude now, it will take a lot to bring them around.

If you are in 11.04 and are seeing these issues, please file a bug because we'd love to look into it more (and this isn't the place to do debugging).\nThe \"files disappearing\" thing should never happen, so please do let us know if you're seeing that.\n\nA: I've used Ubuntu One filesync daily for a few months and I've never had any unreasonable conflicts. When I work in LibreOffice on files stored in a synced folder, then I've gotten some conflicts, and I've come to understand that's because of LOs auto-save feature. So I've stopped doing that and instead work in an unsynced folder and just copy. It isn't perfect, but it's quite reliable. I don't know enough about syncs to understand how this could be fixed. I mean, if the local file is changed while the previous save is being uploaded, then the uploaded file will not be the same as either the local or the remote file. How should this be handled? Well, a better tool for handling conflicts are necessary. But I don't think those conflicts itself can be avoided. \nSo I've had no reason to question Ubuntu One filesyncs robustness. Sync of DesktopCouch is not at all robust or stable -- except that it's been reliably unavailable for months.\n", "Q: What to use to quickly cut Audio/Video If just need to crop Audio/Video from a longer track, what can I use? I tried OpenShot, but I find the export video slow, perhaps its compling all the \"layers\" into a new movie? Perhaps I just need a simple \"crop\" tool for audio/video will surfice? \n\nA: I'm using ffmpeg CLI interface for that. It's very easy and fast:\n\n\n*\n\n*to cut video:\nffmpeg -i InputFile -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:32 OutPutFile\n\n\n*to cut audio:\nffmpeg -i InputFile  -vn -acodec copy -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:32 OutPutFile\n\nIn both of these -ss is the start point, while -t is the duration of the piece.\nYou can calculate duration e.g. using LibreOffice Calc or python's dateutil package, or you can use the -to option which accepts the end time directly.\n\nA: My preference for easy video clipping has always been avidemux.\n\nJust set the video and audio encoding to Copy and choose the container format you want, within reason.\nInstallation:\nentry at apps.ubuntu.com \nsudo apt-get install avidemux\n\n\nA: With new version from ubuntu avconv\navconv -i srcFileName -c:a copy -c:v copy -ss 00:03:40 -t 00:01:12 targetFileName\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First argument time is from time\n\n*Second argument is duration (not end time) duration may be either in seconds or in \"hh:mm:ss[.xxx]\" form.\n\n\nTo specify end time instead, use the option -to [end time].\nPlease refer to ffmpeg documentation for more informations\n\nA: Try Avidemux \nsudo apt-get install avidemux\n\nor LiVES \nsudo apt-get install lives\n\n\nA: There is also WinFF that is avconv graphic interface. It works great. I installed it from Ubuntu Software Center.\nHere is the screenshot:\n\n\nA: kdenlive is (in my experience) the easiest software which will allow you to perform that task in a few steps and without problems. Even so, the OpenShot Video Editor project is also useful but it yet needs lots of hard work to get closer to the kdenlive.\nHere are a screenshot of the kdenlive and openshot respectively:\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: LosslessCut is focused entirely on clipping/cutting, is simple to use and does not re-encode, meaning exporting is fast.\n\nTo ensure audio remains synced with image, use the keyframe cut option.\nGithub repo.\n\nA: I like kdenlive for finishing up as well or clipping out small chunks...but if he wants to split a LARGE lecture into smaller pieces he could try:  \nffmpeg -i input.mpg -ss 00:00:10 -t 00:00:30 out1.mpg -ss 00:00:35 -t 00:00:30 out2.mpg\n\ndiscussion of the command is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=480343\n\nA: *\n\n*Avidemux (From PPA) - http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/\n\n*OpenShot (From PPA) - https://launchpad.net/openshot/ http://www.openshot.org/ppa/\n\n*Pitivi (From PPA) - http://www.pitivi.org/?go=download\nI was going to mention commands like ffmpeg or avconv (The new one) which can OBVIOUSLY split files into groups.

You need workout some 20-min tutorial to survive the interface, but then it appears to be unexpectedly pleasant to use.\n\nA: OpenShot Video Editor looks promising. Have you checked it?. Checkout the features: http://www.openshot.org/features/\nThe official installation method is via AppImage available at https://www.openshot.org/download/\nTo install it just open a terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonoomph/openshot-edge\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openshot openshot-doc\n\nJust give a try.\n\n\nA: I use Kdenlive, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could even slice video this way in PiTiVi:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new project with your full lecture.\n\n*Set your start and end points for the first \"manageable chunk\" in the clip monitor.\n\n*Drag from the video in the clip monitor down to your timeline. It will be just the chunk you chose.\n\n*Set new start and end points in the clip monitor and repeat as needed.\n\n\nA: In PiTiVi 0.13.5 (Ubuntu 10.10) I was able to simply select a clip and go to Timeline > Split (or just press \"S\").\n\nA: For quickly cutting I have used MythTV. I recorded some show, let it automatically search for the commercial breaks and fine-tuned the found markers. After this I started the Myth archiving function and burned all to DVD, without the commercials.\nI have to admit, it worked gread from about 2006 or such. Somewhere in 2008 or 2009 some update ruined it all, my markers where somehow shifted.\nRight now, I'm in the progress of re-installing this myth stuff, just to see if I can get the trimmer/editor and archiver working.\n\nA: Yesterday I just found that I can do it online,\nWith a youtube account:) If you are in a hurry, and do not have\nenough time to try which ubuntu software works for you,\nthen do it online.\nGo to youtube account, upload your video, then\nselect\nVideo Manager,\nthere is a Enhancement option,\nat the bottom right corner there lies Trim option\nWatch this 1 minute tutorial if you still can not find it\n\n\nA: If you want a GUI application you can use dmMediaConverter, a ffmpeg frontend, which has a split function, without reencoding, fast. Just add the split points and press Run. Also, it can do a lot of other stuff.\nhttp://dmsimpleapps.blogspot.ro/2014/04/dmmediaconverter.html\n\n\nA: vidcutter is a very useful tool for cutting, trimming and merging videos in ubuntu:\nInstall vidcutter:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ozmartian/apps\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install vidcutter\n\nworks in ubuntu 17.10\n\nA: Use this\n\nI've written it to cut out ads from recorded TV videos. Using the included remuxer you do not even to have to recode it. There is nothing fancy about it. Just fast.\n\nA: To just crop without trans-coding\n(copying instead), I suggest a yad script to be run from a desktop file launcher.\nI have found the script here.\nI have modified it a bit to include video formats and to avoid transcoding.\nIt looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nINPUT=$(yad --width=600 --height=400 --file-selection --file-filter='*.mp3 *.mp4 *.avi *.m4a *.ogg *.flac *.aac *.opus')\n\neval $(yad --width=400 --form --field=start --field=end --field=output:SFL \"00:00:00\" \"00:00:00\" \"${INPUT/%.*}-out.${INPUT##*.}\" | awk -F'|' '{printf \"START=%s\\nEND=%s\\nOUTPUT=\\\"%s\\\"\\n\", $1, $2, $3}')\n[[ -z $START || -z $END || -z $OUTPUT ]] && exit 1\n\nDIFF=$(($(date +%s --date=\"$END\")-$(date +%s --date=\"$START\")))\nOFFSET=\"\"$(($DIFF / 3600)):$(($DIFF / 60 % 60)):$(($DIFF % 60))\n\nffmpeg -ss \"$START\" -t \"$OFFSET\" -i \"$INPUT\" -c copy -map 0 \"$OUTPUT\"\n\nSo, install yad, save the script as cut_audio-video.sh and make it executable.\nThan create the file ~/.local/share/applications/cut-audio-video.desktop similar to:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Cut audio & video\nExec=/PATH/TO/cut_audio-video.sh\nIcon=/SOME/AUDIO/ICON/Audio-icon.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;HardwareSettings;X-GNOME-Settings-Panel;System;\n\nChange Exec and Icon lines.\nThen it can be run with an app launcher like Synapse:\n\nSelect the file, then enter the time for start and end of the cut/crop\n\n\nA: I wrote a helper for ffmpeg that mimics substr() syntax.\nUsage\nffslice infile [start [duration [outfile [ffmpeg-args]]]]\nExamples\n# Get the last 5 minutes of an MP3\nffslice input.mp3 -5:00\n\n# Get the first 30 seconds of a webm\nffslice input.webm 0 30\n\n# Get 5 minutes of video starting at 2 minutes in\nffslice input.mp4 2:00 5:00\n\nCode\n#!/bin/bash\n# substr() for MPEG-encoded files\n\ninfile=\"$1\"; shift\nstart=\"$1\"; shift\nend=\"$1\"; shift\noutfile=\"$1\"; shift\nargs=()\n\n# Convert time to seconds\n# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/412868/bash-reverse-an-array\ntimetosec() {\n  rev=\"$(<<< \"$1\" tr ':' '\\n' | sed 's/^0\\+\\([0-9]+\\)/$1/' | tac | tr '\\n' ' ')\"\n  IFS=' ' read -a times <<< \"$rev\"\n  let secs=\"${times[0]:-0} + (${times[1]:-0} * 60) + (${times[2]:-0} * 3600)\"\n  printf '%i' \"$secs\"\n}\n\n# Input file requred\nif [ -z \"$infile\" ]; then\n  echo \"Usage: $(basename -- \"$0\") infile [start [end [outfile [ffmpeg-args]]]]\" >&2\n  echo \"Example: $(basename -- \"$0\") input.mp3 -5:00\" >&2\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Start (negative starts from the end)\nif [ \"${start:0:1}\" = \"-\" ]; then args+=('-sseof' \"$start\")\nelif [ -n \"$start\" ]; then args+=('-ss' \"$start\")\nfi\n\n# Input\nargs+=('-i' \"$infile\")\n\n# End (use + or - to specify relative to the starting point)\nif [ \"${end:0:1}\" = \"+\" ]; then args+=('-to' \"$end\")\nelif [ \"${end:0:1}\" = \"-\" ]; then args+=('-sseof' \"$end\")\nelif [ -n \"$end\" ]; then\n  let dur=\"$(timetosec \"$end\") - $(timetosec \"$start\")\"\n  args+=('-to' \"$dur\")\nfi\n\n# Default output filename\nfilename=$(basename -- \"$infile\")\nextension=\"${filename##*.}\"\nfilename=\"${filename%.*}\"\ndefaultOutfile=\"${filename}-${start}-${end}.${extension}\"\nif [ -z \"$outfile\" ]; then\n  outfile=\"$defaultOutfile\"\nelif [ -d \"$outfile\" ]; then\n  outfile=\"${outfile}/${defaultOutfile}\"\nfi\n\n# Cannot have colon in the filename with ffmpeg\n# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/412519/ffmpeg-protocol-not-found-for-normal-file-name\noutfile=\"$(printf '%s' \"$outfile\" | sed 's/:/./g')\"\n\n# Slice audio\nffmpeg \"${args[@]}\" -c copy \"$@\" \"$outfile\" 1>&2\n\n# Output the final location\nprintf '%s' \"$(readlink -f \"$outfile\")\"\n\nCaveat\nNote that ffmpeg will only split on keyframes. This usually works well enough for most cases, but if you need precise video segments, see How to extract time-accurate video segments with ffmpeg?. You can force all the needed keyframes before segmenting.\n\nA: I always use Kdenlive.\nJust import the video, drag it onto the timeline, click on the spot where you want to split it, right-click it, and choose cut. Then remove the part you don't need.\n\nA: I've struggled with this same issue, having a large video file that I want to cut and save as separate scenes.  After trying to do this in the usual suspects all listed by others here I ended up using Kino.  \nYou will have to import the file as Kino needs it in dv format (whatever that is) and you can then specify start and end point for each clip on the Edit tab, then export each clip individually on the Export tab.  Works great and is fast, the slowest part is the initial import of the video file.  You can even add effects like titles to each clip.\nI found that it is hard to find the exact spot to cut the scene in Kino and when I play the vid in the built in player there is no sound (there is when exported) and it plays too fast so I play the video in avidemux, find the time or frame number where I want to cut it, then use this info in Kino. \nI do find it crashes a fair bit (I use Ubuntu 15.04 Kino v1.3.4) but it will recover where you were upon restart.\n\nUpdate on the Kino webpage:\n\nKino is a dead project\n  ( 05.08.2013 14:15 )\n  Kino has not been actively maintained since 2009. We encourage you to try other Linux video editors such as Shotcut, Kdenlive, Flowblade, OpenShot, PiTiVi, LiVES, and LightWorks.\n\n", "Q: what is the yakuake alternative for unity desktop? is there any alternate for yakuake for the unity desktop, when i log in unless i'm in KDE, i cant open yakuake.\nsudo apt-get install yakuake\n\nreturns nothing on unity, while on KDE it installed perfectly.\n\nA: I used yakuake but changed it for guake.

One option is to use IBus with the Amharic - sera layout. Try this: System > Prererences > Keyboard Input Methods. If this is the first time you use it, it will likely ask whether the ibus system should be started (asked twice for me), you should do that.\nThe \"IBus Preferences\" dialog should show up (if it doesn't, try the menu option once more). From the dialog, choose Input Method tab, and select Amharic - sera (m17n) and click on Add to make it available.\nTry if it works in your applications, by switching between normal and IBus with Ctrl + Space, for example in LibreOffice: Ctrl + Space, \"selam\", Space, Ctrl + Space, \"hello\" should input first the correct fidäl and then English (assuming that is your default keyboard layout).\n\nA: You also need to install the ibus-m17n  package or you won't find Amharic Sera as an option in the menu.\n", "Q: How to ensure full package install after removing a meta-package?

The HID button might work in Linux without a driver but it won't be connected up to any known event.  If it does automatically work, it should have registered a device in /dev/input/. If that's a case, it's fairly simple to hook an event around it.\nIf there isn't a device registered automatically, it might be a very non-standard USB device that needs a custom driver for itself.

My hardware was blocked via a hardware switch(fn+f8) which doesn't work in ubuntu(works with windows, but uninstalled windows). rfkill showed 0: phy0: Wireless Lan as Hard Blocked.\n\nA: On my Lenovo E530, the wireless didnt work, and rfkill showed it as blocked by hardware. It turned out the wireless LAN radio was turned off in the BIOS. Turning it on solved the problem.\n\nA: Got the same problem spent lot of time trying different solutions (hard/soft) then just reset bios to factory default and it worked!!\nas always if a solution exists has to be simple.....\n\nA: I had a similar problem on an HP 635. It was solved by simply connecting the laptop to an ethernet cable. This automatically unblocked the wireless switch, and the wireless started working.\n\nA: Some laptops have switches that are BARELY noticeable. I have a DELL laptop where the switch is on the right side of the laptop. I accidentally turned it off once (didn't even know it was there) and then accidentally turned it back on and that's how I found out about it.

I have /home on a separate partition. I want to reinstall Ubuntu.\nI don't want to lose my personal files in /home (I already have a backup but I would like to avoid the hassle of restoring the backup). I know how to reinstall Ubuntu using an existing /home partition without formatting it, but I don't want any configuration from previous Ubuntu to be in the new install.\nIn other words, I would like a new and fresh install of Ubuntu, with my previous personal files in /home but WITHOUT any configuration file from the previous Ubuntu install. Is this possible? How could I accomplish that?\nI was thinking about manually deleting all hidden configuration files in /home (those starting with a \"dot\") from the Live CD before starting the installer, but I'm not sure if the file permissions will allow me to delete those files. I'm also not sure if that will be enough to not bring any configuration settings from the previous install. I thought it would be good to ask here before trying to do that, for \"safety\" reasons ;)\n\nA: I always have a /home partition separate from the / so when i'm on a fresh install/upgrade, when i get to the \"set up partitions\" step, I select one for / (formatted) and another for /home (not formatted) but with the same file system as the previous one (or compatible).\nThen, when creating users, I make sure to use the same user names as the previous installation so /home/user gets to the same place.\nWhat is great about this is that it doesn't overwrite the user's directory.\nThus if I had /home/mike, after my upgrade I'll have a mount on /home again and create the user mike so it gets all the files and config files from the previous version on /home/mike.\nThe only thing missing here are the /etc config files that need a backup/restore.\n\nA: This is what I always do:\nOn the livecd I mount the /home partition and use the command\nsudo chown -hR  ubuntu /path/to/home/drive\n\nThe ubuntu gives ownership to the username ubuntu (the live cd's username is ubuntu) andfolder  the path is whatever the drive is mounted to. On the live cd this is usually in /media/ and the name is made up of many numbers a letters.\nNow delete all the config files (files and folders beginning with a dot), but I do leave a few (such as .minecraft for my game saves).\nIts not just folders but also files beginning with a dot.\nDuring the installer. Go to the custom partition manager. Set your partition as mount point /home (by clicking on it and selecting edit or change, or whatever they call it now), and leave it so it is not formatted, (in the F column of the drives list check marks mean it will be formatted) and set your OS partition (one with system files) as mount point / and DO format that one.\nHOWEVER\nAfter you finish the install and login your home drive will be useless since its ownership is still on ubuntu. to change it again run\nsudo chown -hR YourUsernameHere ~/\n\n\nA: I've done this quite often now - almost every time I did upgrade my system or (especially) if I switched to another distro.\nI normally log out, go to a console and log in as root directly (or depending on system configuration, as another user and switch to root), cd to /home folder and simply change my user's home folder name e.g. to \"myUserName.bak\".\ne.g.:\nsudo mv /home/myUserName /home/myUserName.bak\n\nAfter installation I can safely move all data needed to the newly created home folder for my user. (That's also a good point for thinking whether you e.g. really need that folder of big files you never touched the last 2 years ;) )\nedit as suggested by comments:\nbefore you can access the files and folders from your renamed home folder you have to\nsudo chown -R newUser.newUsersGroup /home/myUserName.bak\n\n\nA: I have done this by moving the hidden files and folders into a separate directory (but I guess deleting them would work too) and then shutting down and installing from the live CD exactly as suggested by grahammechanical in his answer. \nI can confirm that it works (or at least it did for me). \nIf you keep the hidden files and folders instead of deleting them you can use them to selectively restore any configurations that you may decide you want to keep after all.\n\nA: You might be the first person to try what you are wanting to do. So, you can tell us if it works.\nI would suggest that you delete those hidden files/folders beginning with a dot (or, if you are nervous - rename them to .somethingold) then shutdown and boot into the live CD and reinstall without marking /home to be formatted.\nPrograms that are installed afresh will create new dot files/folders. \n", "Q: How can I get both of my monitors working with Ubuntu? I have two W2252TQ Flatron screens, both were working in windows 7 prior to installing Ubuntu 10.04. The active monitor is connected via DVI with the VGA one dark. If I disconnect the DVI one then the VGA monitor becomes the active one. I would like both of them to work.\nAdditionally if I check the monitors settings it says \"Monitory: unknown\" with the refresh rate at 50hz. However the monitor seem to be working fine at the right resolution.\nI have activated the additional drivers for my NVIDIA graphics card although it says \"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system.\"\nWhat can I do to make Ubuntu handle the second monitor?\n\n.\n\nA: I recently had something similar happen to me.\nTo resolve it I selected \"NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version 173)\"\nAfter it downloads and installs the driver, you're supposed to restart your computer. I'm fairly certain you won't receive any indications about this.\nAfter your restart your computer, both monitors should display your desktop without your intervention. Will then be up to you to configure.\nCheers!\n\nA: I would suggest you to use the propietary nVidia Settings GUI for that purpose with sudo by dropping the sudo nvidia-settings in a terminal, this way you will be able, (the same as normal way) to set your monitor preferences, in which you can enable both TwinView and Separate X-Screen.\nThe difference between using sudo in this case is that you may experience an issue when trying to save your preferences to your current X Configuration file, task that can be achieved by hitting the \"Save to X Configuration file\" in your X Server Display Configuration screen, a screenshot is placed here for your convenience with the Twinview Configuration in action, which in the case of some nVidias may result in an extended desktop instead of a screen clone. (as in my Spakle 9400GT) \nGood luck!\n\n\nA: Once I used this \"trick\" in a friend's computer and it worked, so it's maybe worth trying.\nCopy the Bus ID from your graphic card and input it into your xorg.conf\nlspic | grep VGA\n\nThe output will be something like that \n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 0df4 (rev a1)\n\nSo, copy the Bus ID from your graphic card, in this sample 00:02.0 \nBack to the console type:\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nGo to the section \"Devices\" and add the line below, but in the Bus ID you have to replace the last dot \".\" for a \":\"\nBusid \"PCI:00:02:0\"\n\nRemeber, 00:02:0 and not 00:02.0 ;-)\nI hope it helps.\n\nA: I could not get twinview working after initial install either. I switched from Nvidia (Recommended) to Post Release driver with no luck, even after running sudo nvidia-xconfig, sudo nvidia-settings.\nThen I switched back to Nvidia Recommended driver, Reboot. In terminal: sudo nvidia-xconfig, then sudo nvidia-settings. Chose 2nd monitor for twinview and setup both monitors accordingly. Now it got weird as the monitor came on, but I lost all frames and keyboard controls. So at this point I did a manual reboot from reset button on my tower, crossed my fingers just for luck and whala !! everything is fine... at least for now it seems.\nOh also before switching drivers back I had also deleted the new xorg.conf file that was created and renamed the orig file back before creating another new one. (hope that makes sense)\n", "Q: Is there a way to programmatically move and resize gnome windows? I'd like to get some of the functional of xmonad in gnome. Is it possible to write a shell script that will resize and position the windows that are open on the Gnome desktop?\n\nA: You can do scripts using xdotool.  \n\"What is xdotool?\nThis tool lets you simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.\"\n\nA: Another option is wmctrl, that works with any EWMH/NetWM compatible window manager\n", "Q: Screen issues (image shifted to the right) with AMD Radeon HD 6850 Since I installed my graphics card - a AMD Radeon HD 6850 - I couldn't get Ubuntu to work. I've just installed Ubuntu again but still no success to run it properly. I've installed using updates and MP3 codecs.\nWhen I start Ubuntu, I see the monitor is slipped right. How can I solve this issue?\n\nA: I had the very same problem with the very same HD6850. Here's what to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from LiveCD.\n\n*Mount your hard drive by clicking it from Home folder for example.\n\n*In a terminal, run:\nsudo gedit /media/hddUUIDcode/etc/default/grub\n\n(where hddUUIDcode - unique code of hard drive where Ubuntu installed).

The only thing I have changed in terms of users is to add my user to the group www-data.\nSomeone here who knows how this can be fixed?\n\nA: Run ecryptfs-mount-private. It should be doing this automatically but until you can work out why it isn't, that should unlock your home, once you have logged in.\nAs for the actual issue, I've no idea why it's only running intermittently.\n", "Q: Corrupted Partition Table in Ubuntu Natty I messed around with my partition table a few weeks ago, now I can't start up Ubuntu, except recovery mode.\nIt gives me an error message in the beginning like /device/sda1 is not ready or not present then it FREEZES.\nIs there a way to restore it?\n\nA: It's hard to know precisely what's happened. I suggest that perhaps the UUID (unique identifier) of the partition has changed with your playing around but it might be broken more than that.\nWhatever happens, you'll need an Ubuntu CD. It doesn't have to be the same version as what you currently have installed, but it might help. Burn that to CD/USB and then boot to it.\nThe next bit is fairly simple. Install boot-repair by opening a terminal in the live environment and firing this off:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair-ubuntu\n\nThen run it from the applications menu. For more help using boot-repair, follow this guide but it's pretty simple.\n\nIf that doesn't help, something is more screwed up than any of us would like. There could be partition damage so check to see if you can access it (again, from the LiveCD). If that works, I'd be tempted to rescue any data I might need and reinstall Ubuntu. It's probably faster and cleaner than trying to bodge it back into life.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Install Failing- Hard Drive Trying to dual-boot UBuntu and Windows 7 on the same 1TB Sata hard drive, but the Ubuntu installer won't recognize the drive- the live CD will, though, and can see it under GParted, etc.\nAlready tried going into BIOS and changing away from IDE. No luck.\n\nThis is OP- I think I was mistaken about what was going wrong. I meant that the installer itself won't recognize the hard drive, but when I use Ubuntu from the live CD, I'm able to see the hard drive, edit it with GParted, even open files from the windows partition.\nBut, when the installer gets to the step \"Allocate Drive Space\", it has nothing there- no devices, no partitions, nothing.\n\nA: Boot up into your LiveCD as normal. Before running the installer open up a terminal and type in the following command :\nsudo apt-get remove dmraid\n\nDmraid is known to stop some hard drives being detected in the installer. Removing (uninstalling) it solves the problem.\nTo open terminal on Ubuntu 12.04: ctr + alt + T.\n\nA: open desktop with liveCD. open terminal, write these command and post the output\nsudo -i\nfdisk -l\n\nEDITED:\nYour partition health is not good [hard disk is ok]. Ubuntu does not recognize your partitions but should detect hard disk. \"Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary\" here is one problem in windows partition. I think you partitioned your new hard disk with window 7 [never do this].\nsafe solution is, delete all your partition and create new with gparted live or partition magic or windows xp or ubuntu. Always remember, keep 1st partition for windows.\notherwise windows will not be installed.\nalternative solution is, try to install ubuntu as 'inside windows' . install ubuntu in windows as a software . [google ubuntu inside windows].\nNote: If you do partition with windows xp or ubuntu then need not install full os. when create partition complete just restart on half way. For dual boot, install windows first then ubuntu.\n\nA: Make sure you do not have the disc mounted before trying to install. If you have the disc mounted (able to see/open files) then you will not be able to install Ubuntu to that disc as the installer will not be able to write changes to it. \n\nA: Have you tried booting into the LiveCD, checking if the drive is available (mount it and then unmount it) and then run the installer from the LiveCD itself (the Install Ubuntu Shortcut on the Desktop)?\n", "Q: How to set up ssh connection (acessible over internet, not LAN) using MTS MBLaze modem?

Problem I Faced\n\n*\n\n*I installed something that crashed my Wifi drivers that I compiled earlier.\n\n*Un-installing the same package doesn't helped.\n\n*Finally, I re-compiled my wifi drivers and things are good.\n\nMy Question\nBut, is there anything like System Restore or System Rollback in Ubuntu/LinuxMint?\n\n*\n\n*Is there anything that can undo an apt-get install package command?\n\n\nA: The complement of apt-get install package is apt-get remove package. To remove all associated settings too, you need to run apt-get purge package.\nNote that these commands rely on the uninstallation scripts provided with the package. All packages in the main repository I know of do their job of uninstalling very well. This may not be the case for third-party packages.\nAs for your driver issue, there are a few possibilities why installing a package broke your wireless driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*The driver has a post-installation hook which is executed when a condition is met, e.g. kernel updates\n\n*The package overwrote a file that the wireless driver depended on\n\n*The package in question was a kernel update but the driver does not have a post-installation hook for recompiling the driver (most likely)\n\n\nAs for the \"System rollback\" / \"System Restore\" features, the closest feature you'll get is a system image using software like Clonezilla. Unfortunately, this cannot be done within a running system and must be performed from a Live CD.\n\nA: There is no such feature in Ubuntu like \"Restore to previous state\" in Windows. You should have taken backup, to restore the machine to an earlier stage. Seriously I am also missing this feature. There are many tools but none of them work like Windows Restore point nor Macs Time Machine.  Let's see if things get better in backup in Linux.\n\nA: There is a software for Linux called Timeshift exactly for this purpose. Using Timeshift you can take snapshots of your Linux system regularly and restore them whenever you need.\nThis software brings System Restore feature of Windows to your Linux distribution.\nA short description from its official website:\n\nTimeShift for Linux is a application that provides functionality similar to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine tool in Mac OS. TimeShift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots can be restored later to bring your system to the exact state it was in at the time when the snapshot was taken. \nSnapshots are taken using rsync and hard-links. Common files are shared between snapshots which saves disk space. Each snapshot is a full system backup that can be browsed with a file manager.\n\n\nA: Actually, there are few things in Ubuntu et al. that will allow you to roll-back changes.  Brief below:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/backups/dpkg.status.*: this directory keeps a set of log of the last system state prior to an install as follows; /var/backups/dpkg.status.0 is the most recent log prior to a state change (e.g. package install/remove/update ...etc); /var/backups/dpkg.status.?.gz are compressed, archived versions of the logs at various points in time, rotated monthly.\n\n*/var/lib/dpkg/status: this is the current state of installed packages.  Manually backing this up, or providing a logrotate script in /etc/logrotate.d will ensure schedule snapshots of your system state to your liking.\n\n*Roll-back: the corner stone is your previous state /var/backups/dpkg.status.0.  Here is a brief step-wise procedure to restore previous package state (note brief and not exhaustive).\na.  cp /var/backups/dpkg.status /var/lib/dpkg/status (will revert back the package state one version back).\nb. dpkg -l | grep ii (will give you a list of supposedly installed packages based on the rolled-back /var/lib/dpkg/status file achieved in step a. above).\nc.  dpkg -l | grep ii | awk '{print \"apt-get --reinstall -y install\", $2}' > /tmp/reinstall && sh /tmp/reinstall (will create a simple one-liner shell script and runs that to reinstall packages determined to have been on the system prior to an apt-get operation)\nd. apt-get --reinstall install ucf (will take care of sanitising /etc config files et. al)\ne. Repeat step c. if/as necessary\n\nWith a minimal bit of luck, you should be OK.\n\nA: btrfs has/will have some nifty snapshot features that should be able to handle this sort of stuff. Just keep your data in one filesystem and your system in another, and use periodic (daily? weekly?) snapshots, then roll back whenever problems arise.\n\nA: Apart from Timeshift and the /var logs mentioned, you can also use etckeeper to guard against ruining config files in your /etc directory and not having backups to restore to. It uses a VCS. \n", "Q: How to move my Trash into /tmp or automatically empty trash on reboot? I rarely use Trash. (I use Shift+Delete) But recently, I found I often remove some important files by mistake. So I want to use Trash now.\nBut as we all know, my limited disk space will be filled with files in Trash if I don't clear the Trash by myself.\nSo I have an idea. I want to move my Trash into /tmp , so that I won't have to clear it myself.\nI wrote some code into ~/.bash_profile like this:\nmkdir /tmp/my-trash\n\nI made a symbol link pointing to /tmp/my-trash. I removed the directory ~/.local/share/Trash/files, and moved my symbol link into ~/.local/share/Trash, and renamed it into files.\nBut it doesn't work! I put some files into /tmp/my-trash, clicked the Trash icon in the lower right corner. But there is nothing. I chose a file and pressed Delete , but it said that it cannot move the file into Trash and asked me to permanent remove the file. \n\nA: Why don't you use another approach:\nCrontab combined with command line client for trash\n\n\n*\n\n*Install trash-cli  / sudo apt-get install trash-cli, which will allow you to control your trash folder from shell.\n\n*Open your crontab with crontab -e in shell (will open your default shell editor chosen by select-editor)\n\n*Add an entry like\n# In your crontab\n@reboot    empty-trash > /dev/null\n\nNow on every reboot your trash will be emptied. You can specify other times to empty trash. Just look at a crontab tutorial to learn how.\n\nOf course you can use your link approach from above just as well. The problem with your approach was that you copied the link. Most likely that broke the link. Also your newly created folder /tmp/my-trash/ didn't have the proper directory structure of a trash folder specified by the free desktop standard. That can be remedied in the following way: (FIRST empty the trash manually) \nmv -r ~/.local/share/Trash/ ~/.trashcopy\ncp -r ~/.trashcopy /tmp/.trashcopy\nln -s /tmp/.trashcopy ~/.local/share/Trash\n\nTo make that change persistent, you have to include the following line in your user's crontab with crontab -e or just the part without @reboot in your ~/.bashrc.\n@reboot  rm -r ~/,local/share/Trash; cp -r ~/.trashcopy /tmp/.trashcopy; ln -s /tmp/.trashcopy ~/.local/share/Trash\n\n", "Q: Wireless network not connecting in Kubuntu 11.04 I've got a fairly fresh install (a month old) of Kubuntu without much modification done to it and I'm having massive issues connecting to any wireless network.

I am now using dual monitors. I am wondering whether I could use three monitors on my system?\nThanks\nAnand\n\nA: You would need to have an additional graphics card.\nGive us details as to what graphics cards (+model) you already have in case it requires special instructions. \n\nA: You could buy something like Matrox's TripleHead2Go.\nIt's essentially a box that you plug all your screens into and then plug that into your graphics card. The box appears as one monitor so negates having to fight with drivers and whatnot.\nThe downside is Ubuntu doesn't know that it's a dual/tri-screen setup so won't know how to maximise things properly (they'll split over the two screens) and dialogue placement might be over the two screens. \nThe other downside is it's expensive. Really expensive... As expensive as a graphics card that can support 3+ monitors on a desktop.\n\nA: You may be able to use a monitor connected to a USB docking station in addition to your existing monitor.  It appears some have Linux drivers.\n\nA: I was trying to do the same thing, and went down the external USB video card route and never got it to work.

(Is there a SANDBOX ?) I did an X.org update on Ubuntu, and that landed me with some graphics problem and ultimately into shell.\nIs there something like SANDBOX on which you could try out something and rollback if not liked ?\nPlease help.. !\n\nA: If you hold left-shift immediately after BIOS you should see a menu asking you what you want to boot to. This is the grub bootloader which usually just selects the latest kernel.\nIf you then select the latest \"recovery mode\", that should present you with another menu which should allow you to pick faisafeX which again, presents another menu which lets you use the most bog-standard drivers possible. This might let you temporarily get back into a graphical setting. There are also options for resetting configurations in this deepest menu which might also be worth a go.\nIf that doesn't hail any success, the update that broke things may have been a new kernel version. In grub try selecting the second non-recovery item. If that boots through, you might just need to select this manually each boot, and of course, file a bug report on Launchpad against the Linux project so people know there's an issue.\nEither way, actually, what you're doing needs to end in a bug report or nothing is going to get fixed.\n\nAs for protecting yourself against these issues in the future the only viable methods for major system things (like graphics) is to keep some sort of backup from before you update. This either means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Taking a full disk image with a tool like Clonezilla, or\n\n*Using a filesystem like btrfs (which is now fairly stable) that will let you take live snapshots of the system, and roll back to the old system.\n\n\nI freely admit that neither is a convenient solution. The first requires booting into a live-CD environment before you can take the image and the second requires reinstallation and reformatting the disk to btrfs (I don't think there is a nice conversion tool) besides having to learn the process for taking and restoring snapshots.\n\nA: It's rare that system updates breaks your graphics because of the testing done before. Should such an update break your system, you should definitively report it as bug. A sandbox for playing can be set up using VirtualBox.\nvirtualbox \nVirtualBox is virtualization software. Your physical machine is the host, a VirtualBox instance (a virtual machine) is a the guest.\nYou can install your OS (Ubuntu) in that virtual machine and create snapshots. Should you want to try new software or want to mess with your configuration, you have not to worry about having a broken system after it because you can restore snapshots should anything go wrong.\n", "Q: Are wine-based and mono-based programs started differently?

And if I leave my laptop alone for 15 minutes, the screen does go black (and lock itself). \nHow can I actually change these settings? I would also want to stop it from locking itself every time it went inactive -- just blank the screen.\n\nA: Workaround\nCaffeine is a program that does what you want power management to-do.\nYou can install caffeine by adding the ppa. you can do that in \nSystem --> administration --> Update manager --> settings --> then tap the \"other sources\" tab --> add\nppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\n\nAnd now press the reload button.\nor you can do it in a terminal: \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install caffeine by typing in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nPower mangament\nBut you could also try to set the Power management settings as system default by pressing \"make default\", that worked for me in 11.04 and 10.04.1. \n\n\nA: You said after \"15 minutes the screen does go black,\" so it sounds to me like you're looking for the screen settings:\n\nTo get there, go to System Settings and click on Screen.  That's where you can change whether your monitor dims, and whether the screen turns off after a given duration.\n", "Q: Why unity will not find my folder?

Also, if I select to search \"Folders\" instead of \"All Files\" it still finds nothing.\nWhy it doesn't work? Is it only with me?\n\nA: If you want to search for existing files, then you should do that in Nautilus. If you want quick access to files you've used, then the Files and Folders lens is great tool. Perhaps in the future, there will be another lens for it, but at least for now, the lens searches the Zeitgeist log for file events. I think that's a good thing, because it means the system learns from my actions instead of just providing a \"dumb\" search. \nBut I do think, from a usability point of view, that both types of searches should be available from the same place.

I reported it as a bug and it's been fixed in 11.10. \"Remote Desktop\" in Ubuntu is not the same thing as in Windows. It's intended to share your running desktop with someone else. In 11.10, it's been renamed to \"Desktop Sharing\" to better reflect that. It also uses another protocol, VNC, so if you want to connect to your shared desktop from Windows, you'll need to install a VNC viewer.

On the command line date is OK as well...\nTurns out it's in the widget settings itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rightclick on clock widget and select 'Digital Clock Settings'\n\n*Choose 'Time Zone': both UTC and your local timezone (Amsterdam in my case) should be selected... but here's the crunch:\n\n*Below 'Clock default to' was set to UTC; changed this to my timezone and applied.\n\n\nVoila!\n\nA: I've finally found the solution. I had to edit my ~/.profile and replace TZ='America/Chicago' with my own timezone. After making the change, logging out and logging back in, the time displayed is now correct.\n\nA: You can use the GUI in the time and date preferences to set your timezone and then be sure to run this command in the terminal:\nsudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nThis will ensure that your machine polls the ubuntu server to get the right time and date for your timezone.\nTo verify, type\ndate    \n\nin the terminal.\n\nA: Under Xubuntu, you may need to remove the clock widget or clock 'element', then put it back.\nThis solved my problem of clock displaying UTC time instead of local time.\n", "Q: How can I recover Endpoint Encryption bootloader? I have a bit of a problem. I have a Win 7 partition encrypted with Mcafee Endpoint Encryption. I used to boot with MEE, but GRUB replaced that bootloader. I made the huge mistake of not making a backup of the mbr :(. Now I can load Ubuntu, but when I try to load the Win7 partition the following message is shown: \"Missing Operating System...\"\nIs there any way to recover my encrypted partition data(I have the username and password)? Or is there a way to recover the MEE bootloader?\n\nA: I have done some checking for you in relation to this and it looks like bad news to be honest. \nWithout access to the Wintech CD (The MEE recovery software) or the Safetech FD (Pre version 5) it is almost and I say almost impossible to recover the files.\nI don't know if you can download an ISO of the Wintech Cd and use your .SDB file (Assuming you created one when you set-up the encryption.\nThere are companies that specialise in recovering data from Hard drives and this sort of error and I know my company deal with this kind of issue on a much lesser scale so it may be worth thinking about that option however as you have now installed Ubuntu I am daring to make the assumption losing this HDD for a while is not an option.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: My solution was to get a recovery ISO built by a support tech who had access to my machine's encryption XML file.  Third item you need is McAfee's daily recovery code.  After fully decrypting the Win7 partition, I was able to boot without issue.\nMy scenario I had was a dual boot Xubuntu / Win7 setup.  GRUB gave access to either OS flawlessly.  Afterwards, encrypted the Win7 partition using McAfee's WDE via my company's management server (ePO).  \nA month after encrypting, I received a GRUB update and this caused an issue with the Windows loader.  When I selected Win7 it gave me the same error.\n", "Q: Unity hotkey for minimizing current window?

From my experience, I've found that with Cent OS, I don't feel constrained with the configurations, compared to XAMPP which seems to be more of a \"hand holding\" quick deploy & test kit.\nWith Ubuntu however as I'm running the Desktop version (mainly because I've had bad experiences running the Ubuntu web server edition) I'm not sure if I should use XAMPP for my test server, or if I could install everything natively so I maintain more control.\nThanks very much in advance for any insights,\n\nA: I'd definitely choose for the packages provided by Ubuntu (if that's what you mean by \"native\"). LAMPP is more bloated in my opinion since it includes everything you do not need. It was designed to work on most Linux distributions and therefore might not be that optimized as the native ones. On windows, you had no package manager which took care of updating your software so XAMPP would be the most logical solution if you do not want to spend some time on configuring Apache, MySQL and PHP.\nAn advantage of using Ubuntu packages is that you do not have to wait for the XAMPP developers to deploy a new package if one of the components is outdated. Simply open your package manager and update your packages, add/ remove individual component, restart the webserver and you're done.\n", "Q: Wired Network Does not Connect on first Boot I am having a problem with one of my desktop computers not connecting to the wired network when I first turn it on in the morning.

Just a thought...\nDo you switch on your Internet connection just before switching on your computer?

On a single user machine with full disk encryption, is there a security advantage to using Thunderbird's Master Password, or is it safe to leave it disabled?\nWithout enabling the Master Password, could something like surfing the web potentially reveal the passwords for the e-mail accounts in Thunderbird? or is Master Password intended more as a protection for accounts on a multi-user computer?\n\nA: Once you boot other people with physical access to the computer or hackers making use of any vulnerabilities in the system could get access to your saved passwords. So it makes sense to encrypt them via master password anyway.\n\nA: I think none of your hypoteses is correct. Master Password is only a convenience to not to enter several password if you have configured several account on Thunderbird: with a Master Password you only need to enter a unique password to unlock all accounts.\nMoreover, you can get a reduced security with Master Password, because Thunderbird need to save all of your password somewhere.

Unfortunately, when I run it from 2D, I wind up with 3D running, plus the 2D panel and launcher. Both are on the screen simultaneously. I suspect that the 2D processes I'm killing are getting re-spawned somehow.

So, it works for my most common use case, but the fact that it fails the other way around suggests to me that I'm doing something wrong.\n\nA: When you run metacity --replace, I would expect it to end the Compiz session for you. Hence, perhaps it would help if you did not call stop_3d, but just start_2d. It might be the case that you now manually kill 3D, which triggers a restart of Compiz, however, before it is restarted, 2D will launch but think 3D isn't running and, hence, not end it properly (without triggering a restart).\nJust a hunch, but you never know.\n", "Q: Where are the MySQL InnoDB log files stored?

To put it simply, I do not want LibreOffice.\nHow can I remove LibreOffice and install OpenOffice. I have tried installing the .deb packages from the OpenOffice download but nothing visibly happens.\nThe menus aren't updated and I can't browse for openoffice in the search.\nAny help please?\n\nA: Starting with Ubuntu 11.04, openoffice.org packages are \"transitional\" packages facilitating migration from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice. That is, they are packages that provide no actual files, but which have the corresponding LibreOffice packages as dependencies, so that LibreOffice gets automatically and smoothly installed.\nTherefore, if you want to continue running OpenOffice.org instead of LibreOffice in Ubuntu 11.04 (or higher), installing Ubuntu's openoffice.org packages will not accomplish this. You will have to install OpenOffice.org from the packages provided at the official OpenOffice.org website. Before doing so, you should remove all the openoffice.org and libreoffice packages currently installed on your system, along with their global configuration files. The easiest way to do this is probably in the Synaptic Package Manager (as suggested by Uri Herrera). Mark these packages for complete removal. These packages' names are listed at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org and https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice (the lists overlap only partially, so check both).\nBefore you replace LibreOffice with OpenOffice.org, you should be aware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice is currently a very close fork of OpenOffice.org. So any functional changes (including new bugs) you are seeing from the version of OpenOffice.org in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or Ubuntu 10.10 to the version of LibreOffice in Ubuntu 11.04 are likely also to be present in the newer version of OpenOffice.org.\n\n*Once you install the upstream version of OpenOffice.org by running the installer obtained from the official OpenOffice.org website, OpenOffice.org will no longer be updated when you update the rest of your Ubuntu system in the Update Manager. Therefore, you will have to make sure it receives updates, and perhaps update it manually. It does have an automated mechanism for checking for updates, however.

I might be biased, but I honestly believe this is great software.\n\nA: Are you after a full IDE (ie, code editor, runtime environment, UI layout tools), or just a utility to create the UI?\nIf it's a full programming environment you're after, have a look at the Quickly toolset.\nIf you're just looking to design interfaces, you can use the 'glade' designer to lay-out your interface using GTK widgets, then load that UI definition into any python program. There's a GTK+ and Glade3 GUI Programming Tutorial (with both Python and C examples).\n\nA: SharpDevelop\n\nSharpDevelop is for developing application based on .Net Framework. It does support IronPython and has GUI designer for WinForm, Silverlight, WPF Application. While Visual Studio also has various GUI designer for IronPython, however it doesn't have GUI for WinForm. \n\nA: Eric IDE \nTry with Eric IDE. I think its the best IDE both for Python and Qt4.\n\n\nA: Glade \nIf you want a wysiwyg GUI designer, Glade is your best bet:\n\n\n*\n\n*first, install glade from the software centre\n\n*create your GUI, save it as, say, myapp.glade\n\n\n*Go to the signals tab and set up your callback, such as on_window1_destroy\n\n*In your python program, tell GTK to load the UI definitions\nimport gtk\n\n\nclass MyApp (object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.builder = gtk.Builder()\n        self.builder.add_from_file(\"myapp.glade\")\n        self.builder.connect_signals(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.builder.get_object(\"window1\").show_all()\n        gtk.main()\n\n    def on_window1_destroy(self, *args):\n        gtk.main_quit()\n\n\nMyApp().run()\n\nAfter getting everything set up, you can dive straight into the Glade tutorial (as Jeremy Kerr mentioned in his answer). Start by learning about the different lay–out options and signals.\n\nQuickly \nWhen you feel comfortable with glade, you can start using it via Quickly, which is a set of programs to make the common tasks in developing software very easy. It takes care of translations, storing configuration, packaging, launchpad integration including PPAs, and lots more:\nsudo apt-get install quickly\nquickly create ubuntu-application hello-world\ncd hello-world/\n\nQuickly now creates a huge project with everything you need already set up. A gui, the translation files, configuration via desktopcouch, and so on.\nYou'll see quickly sets up a few windows (the main App, configuration, and an about dialogue) for you. To start editing your GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*run quickly design\n\n\n*To get to the app's code, run quickly edit\n\n*Go to the HelloWorldWindow.py file\n\n*Now start adding signal handlers and logic.\nFinally, to run your application, type quickly run.\nAt this point, you can get into the PyGTK documentation in order to learn about the signals, their handlers' signatures, the different widgets' methods and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n* PyGTK 2.0 Reference Manual\n\n* PyGObject Reference Manual\n\n*Quickly Widgets (not required)\n\nSee also, some related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What IDE to use for Python?\n\n*Best Visual-Studio Like tool for Linux Development\n\n*Creating GUI with Python in Linux\n\n*What is a good text editor for developing code on?\n\nA: no one has mentioned tool that has quite a lot of use in other languages, and could be be known by starting user - Eclipse has perspective for python called PyDev.\n\nA: Check out PyForms, it is based on PyQt. \nIt can be used with the Qt Designer but it is also quite easy to design GUIs directly in the Python script..  \nhttps://github.com/UmSenhorQualquer/pyforms/\n\nA: Best Python IDE ever is PyCharm.

How can I set screen so it runs automatically any time a user logs in using a CLI interface? If there is already a screen session running for that user, I would like any new logins to attach to that screen session. It would be really nice if on attaching to the screen session a new window is created for each new login.\n\nA: First, for the users you are going to do this for, make sure their ~/.screenrc has the line\nshell /bin/bash\n\n(or whatever other shell your user currently uses). If you do not have this setting set and you change their shell like we will, the user will not be able to login. You might also consider making the screen startup message go away with this line\nstartup_message off\n\nOk, now lets make a runnable script that attaches to the first already running screen session if it exits, and it none is already running it starts one. Run in a terminal\nsudo nano /bin/screenlogin.sh\n\nPut in the two following lines:\n#!/bin/bash\nscreen -x -r || screen\n\nPress Ctrl x and then y to save the file. Run\nsudo chmod 755 /bin/screenlogin.sh\n\nFinally, run chsh on the target user and put in /bin/screenlogin.sh for the shell when asked.\n\nA: Running screen -xR will do basically the same as running screen -xr || screen.\nThe problem is that as far as I know, you can't pass flags to a login shell. Also, having something non-shell like screen as your login shell would probably break things like SFTP.\nSo, what we'll do is set bash as our login shell. Then we will add to the end of .bashrc (a file bash runs when you start it) code that runs screen. Screen will then run whatever shell is specified in .screenrc.\nWe will make it so that this command will run only under a special condition: Only if the current running copy bash has not been started (possibly indirectly) by another copy of bash. This will make it so that if you user wants bash as their shell, and screen starts bash inside of it, the user won't get a Russian dolls explosion of bash inside of screen inside of bash inside of screen inside of bash until the computer runs out of memory.\nFirst, change the shell to /bin/bash, by running chsh, then entering your password, then typing in /bin/bash and pressing enter.\nNext edit the hidden .bashrc file in your home folder, adding the following to the end:\nif [ ${SHLVL} -eq 1 ]; then\n    ((SHLVL+=1)); export SHLVL\n    exec screen -xR\nfi\n\nNow, edit (create if it doesn't exit) the hidden file .screenrc in the home folder. Add or edit the following settings:\nshell /bin/zsh\nstartup_message off\n\n(Of course, if you want some other shell than Zsh, go ahead and put that in instead. It should even work with bash.)\n", "Q: ATI 6XXX Hybrid Graphics w/open source drivers You can turn on/off the dedicated graphics card via OpenSource drivers (acpi_call, vgaswitcheroo, come to mind).

There was this other question asking what directories can be excluded, based on their necessity.\nHowever, I think what I am asking is different enough to merit a separate question.\nI use the Spideroak backup service, and they have some kind of system that keeps historical copies of saved files.\nMy intention was to simply backup my whole home directory, which is somewhere around 70GB in size.\nHowever, it seems some directories contain cache files or other things that are updated or replaced frequently. Because Spideroak is saving every copy with every change, the space I am using on my Spideroak account is rapidly increasing and in danger of maxing out.\nOne solution is to white list only the directories I am sure I want to keep.

I want to back up my bookmarks, but not things like the cache, and with all the sub-directories it's hard to know where to draw the line.\nSo, which directories should I definitely avoid, as they are just frequently updated cache and system files which will unnecessarily bloat my backup?\n\nA: You'll definitely want to exclude the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*/proc \n\n*/lost+found \n\n*/sys \n\n*/mnt \n\n*/media \n\n*/dev\n\n\nand everything they contain \n\nA: An extension like this that exports your bookmarks regularly solves the \"what mozilla files to backup\" problem.\nIf you use git (or any other versioning system) you might want to exclude all .git folders if the repository isn't something you need. I use git as a backup system rather than developer tool for some directories, so the repository isn't crucial if I have another backup of the most recent file(s).\n\nA: User related cache files should be in ~/.cache directory but some software like Firefox don't use that directory like Firefox which use /home/nyamiou/.mozilla/firefox/{profile}/Cache, so you may have to check for all of your software if they do not put cache files somewhere else. Also there is files like .xsession-errors that you don't want to save because they will change very often and you don't really want to save this (it's an error log).\nI'm sorry, I can't provide you a list but you probably should watch the problem the other way around and see what you really want to save instead of what you can exclude.\n", "Q: How to disable S.M.A.R.T. check for single drive?

You can leave it running in a terminal multiplexor (like Byobu) to run it in the background on your server.\nWhen your application crashes again, you can use this command to visualise CPU usage and resident set size of the application.\nprocpath plot -d firefox.sqlite -f firefox.svg -q cpu -q rss --formatter=integer\n\n\n", "Q: What are the options for a very simple launcher? I'm not overly impressed with the new Unity launcher following my upgrade to 11.04. Ubuntu 10.04 with Gnome wasn't too bad once you'd sorted out all your *.desktop files and I'd been running with this for quite a while, but the number of problems I (and others) seem to be having with Unity is considerable.\nAnd, while I may be happy spending the next few weeks trying to nut things out, my major client base (i.e., the wife) is none too happy.\nWhat are the options for a very simple launcher, with the following specs?\n\n\n*\n\n*Small icon which will bring up a text menu. Perhaps in the top area near the power button and network indicator and so forth.\n\n*This icon should be always on top so I can get to it regardless of what's on the screen.\n\n*This icon should be on every workspace so that I can start programs from anywhere.\n\n*A simple text configuration file that I can edit with vi, containing just the menu name and the command to run.\n\n*The menu should come up fast. I don't want to wait two seconds while it reads the configuration file just on the off chance I've changed something (it changes very rarely and, when it does, I'll restart it myself).\n\n\nI don't really want to go back to classic Gnome since I will eventually figure out Unity, so I don't consider that an option. I'm hoping there's a simple solution to this problem that will suffice until my Unity-fu is stronger.\n\nA: I don't really understand what you want. You say you don't want to replace Unity, but you want to add a menu that can be easily edited with a text editor and is fast to use? You can do that with any or all of the icons on the launcher. I think that's the best suggestion. There are lots of readily available menus of that kind which you can use as a template to add your own. It's just a four easy lines, containing a name, a command and, etc. Have a look at these:\nWhat Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\n\nA: Okay, finally found a way to do it that requires zero extra configuration.\nThe trick is to run gnome-panel itself, which is the old task bar application pre-Unity.\nFirst of all, run the System Setting program from your shutdown icon (the power switch in the top right corner of the screen). From there, select Startup Applications.\nAdd a  new application with the name GnomePanel and the command gnome-panel. This will run the old panel on startup.\nThen reboot and voila! All your old settings are there, still controlled by the old methods.\nI also disabled all the key bindings for Unity except for the Super key itself since gnome-panel uses some of these, and set the launcher hide policy to Auto-hide.\nThese last few steps are done in ccsm under Desktop, Ubuntu Unity plug-in.\n", "Q: How can I spin down external hard drive? I want to spin down external hard drive from the terminal before unmounting.\nIt is an sata drive connected through usb.\nRunning hdparm gives this\n ry@G62x:/media$ hdparm -S10 937b2299-48ff-4a9c-8228-67ed4453e8fb/\n\n 937b2299-48ff-4a9c-8228-67ed4453e8fb/:\n setting standby to 10 (50 seconds)\n HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(setidle) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device\n\n\nA: This answer is based on a lot of assumptions, as I do not remember the source of it. But here it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA is actually hot-pluggable, but most of controllers do not support it, while SATA drives should. \n\n*Based on point above: If a drive is unmounted, it is safe to unplug it. Base reason for that is point #3.\n\n*Modern drives have enough power to remove drive heads from the platters in case of emergency power off that is detected.\n\n\nAt least this is what I do. And also, from time to time I do a long S.M.A.R.T. test on the disk, to see if the health of the drive is OK.\n\nA: If it is 2.5\" drive you should be able to hear your drive make click sound about 15 seconds after unmout. That is when drive parked reading/writing heads aside and you can safely remove it. If it is 3.5\" drive then there is no way to make removing safer by spinning the drive down.\n\nA: You can safely unmount and spin-down an external hard disk from the terminal most easily by using the command-line functionality of udisks, which does not require the use of sudo if your system is set up correctly. (To list your device names, enter mount in the terminal first.)\nWhen you have found your external drive, use the following commands. You must first unmount the partition (use sdb1 or whatever mount showed as the location):\nudisks --unmount /dev/sdb1\n\nThen to safely remove (i.e. spindown- you will hear it click and spin-down), use only sdb, for example: \nudisks --detach /dev/sdb\n\nNOTE: It is of crucial importance here that you use sdb or sdc without a partition number when using the detach option; i.e. sdb1 or sdc1 will not work. The partition must be unmounted first and then the disk itself spun down as the examples show.\nThe udisks commands work successfully for all my pata and sata external hard disks.\n\nA: For external USB disks, use\nsg_start --stop /dev/sdb\n\nInstall using \nsudo apt-get install sg3-utils\n\nWorks for my WD My Book Essential Disks.\n\nA: The udisk option did not work in my case but the following did:\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\nsudo hdparm -y /dev/sdb\n\nI make use of these commands when remotely shutting down a headless Linux server with an external USB drive. Security is not a concern in my case, so the server password is in the script.\nFor a Ubuntu server and Windows client the following batch file, assuming PuTTY is installed:\nC:\\\"Program Files (x86)\\PuTTY\\plink.exe\" -ssh -t -l SERVERUSERNAME -pw PASSWORD -noagent 192.168.2.22 \"echo PASSWORD | sudo umount /dev/sdb1 ; sudo -S hdparm -y /dev/sdb; sudo -S halt -i now\"\n\nFor a Debian server, replace sudo halt -i now with shutdown -h -P; in both cases the network card stays awake, so it can be awaken later.\n\nA: If you right-click the drive's icon and select Safely Remove Drive, that should do it (as already stated, it takes 15 seconds or so).\nIf you don't have that option, right-click and unmount the drive. Then start Disk Utility; select the drive in the left panel; select Safe Removal in the right panel. Again, wait 15 seconds or so. (Alternatively, you can Unmount Volume from Disk Utility before Safe Removal if that is easier for you.)\n\nA: It worked in xfce4 on Fedora 17 for powering down external hard disk:\nudisks --detach /dev/sdc\nPalimpsest used to have power off option in Fedora 14, but not in Fedora 17.\nUseful features go out with OS upgrade in both Windows and Linux.\n", "Q: ACPI 30k+ interrupts per second My computer is currently doing something like 30k+ interrupts per second.

It didn't have this issue before (though I had a tonne of headaches with Linux on my computer in general..)\n\nA: The reason apparently lies with the BIOS. Something has changed the BIOS... which caused this problem. Fixed via a reflash of the latest BIOS image from the Lenovo's support site under Windows. \nI noticed when Windows had the same issue of interrupts taking a lot of CPU, which happened to originate from ACPI.sys\nThe only thing I installed prior to this happening was the fglrx 11.7 update...

For the former you can kill all running processes with sudo killall -9 apache2; however, for the latter you'll simple need to wait for them to go away. In the event it's Apache not wanting to stop nicely, what you'll really want to do is investigate what's going on. Finding out exactly what's going on can be difficult though.\nAn interactive strace of the process id may lend a clue as to what site(s) are acting up and causing issues. From your above ps -A you can check the first process with\nstrace -p 1663\n\nThis will attach to the running processes stack trace providing live output of what is going on. At any time you can Ctrl+C\nAn additional resource is the main error log for Apache this can be found in /var/log/apache2/error.log You'll want to get a decent chunk of the log and skim it for details. If the problem is an ongoing issue running\ntail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log\n\nThis similar to the strace will run in realtime. For the last N lines replace -f with -# where the # is a positive number like 50, 100, 282, etc.\n\nA: The command systemctl stop apache2 worked for me.\n\nA: Processes can be asked (by sending a signal to them) to stop. The kill command is a way to do that. If you know the process ID (PID) of the process, it can be asked nicely by running the command below in a terminal:\nkill PID_OF_YOUR_PROCESS\n\nThe above example sends the PID the default TERM signal (code 15). You can look up the signal codes in the man page of kill (man kill).\nWhen the program disregards the TERM signal sent to them, it is still possible to apply a bit more pressure by sending the KILL signal (code 9). This signal is used as a last resort, because the process might not save any unsaved data.\nSpecifying a -SIGNAL_CODE as the first parameter before the process ID will send the process the specific signal. Another useful feature of the kill command is that you can specify more PIDs as in the following example:\nkill -9 PID1 PID2 PID3 PID4\n\nTry to terminate the Apache processes by using the kill -9 line. They should stop unless something blocks them from doing so.\n\nA: I had the same problem but you can't just do one service apache2 stop command - you have to do one PER process. Then, you MAY want to add a sudo in front just in case you're logged into some odd account that needs it so if you see 9 processes running, do 9 sudo service apache2 stop\nWorked great for me.\n\nA: After installing nginx my apache stopped working properly.\nSeems to in some cases apache confusing with nginx.\nJust remove nginx\nsudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n", "Q: How do I download torrents? What is a Torrent, and how do I use them on Ubuntu?\n\nA: The BitTorrent protocol is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol used for distributing large amounts of data. The big file is broken down into smaller parts and it automatically fetches parts from multiple hosts at once. It also shares the parts you've already downloaded with others, so that everybody shares and benefits. \nThe technology itself is perfectly legal, but it has been debated if its implementation in connection with copyrighted material or otherwise illegal material makes the issuer of the bittorrent file, as opposed to the copyrighted material itself, liable as an accomplice or infringer.\nIt is a good way to download Ubuntu iso releases, especially when the regular release sites are slow, since it actually gets faster when there are lots of users downloading and sharing at once.\nHere is how you can use BitTorrent in Ubuntu, starting in 10.04 (the instructions might change slightly in each release, but the basic idea is the same). \nFor this example, I'll be using the Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop ISO - but anything that has a .torrent extension will work following these instructions. \nOpen up a Web Browser (For more on what Web browsers are available for Ubuntu, take a look at this question,\nThen, you'll need to download your .torrent file and save it to disk.\n\nIf this is your first time running Transmission (the default BitTorrent client in Ubuntu) then you'll be confronted with the following box - think long and hard if you agree to it\n\nThen you'll need to click the \"Open\" button and navigate to your .torrent\n\nSit back and relax while the torrent downloads.\n\nAfter the download completes, it is often considered good etiquette to continue to seed the file until you reach a 1.00 ratio. Please be aware that if you have a monthly quota many ISPs count uploads against your total bandwidth. \n\nA: A recent Federal Court of Australia judgement I read had a fantastic explanation of BitTorrent.  \nContent removed due to copyright issues. See the link above: Part B, paragraphs 56-77\n", "Q: How to disable Unity keyboard shortcut for Spread mode I got a very weird problem. My developer laptop runs Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity. As a Java developer I'm using eclipse which whose shortcuts conflicts with the shortcuts of Unity. \nThe problem shortcuts is the one for the Spread mode. It is set to Super + W (in my case Windows + W) what is ok for me so far. The real problem is that Spread mode is also triggered when pressing Shift + Alt + Up. Unfortunately this shortcut is already used by eclipse but is somehow overwritten by Unity. \nI've already read a lot about how to disable and change the shortcuts for unity using the CompizConfig Settings Manager. But I couldn't manage to disable the Shift + Alt + Up combo. \nAny suggestions? \n\nA: This is set in the \"Scale\" plugin in the CompizConfig Settings Manager. \nGo to the settings for \"Scale\" under \"Window Management,\" and you'll see an option for \"Initiate Window Picker\" under bindings.  Just click on the edit icon for that and disable it.\n\nA: The accepted answer above does not seem to work on Ubuntu 11.10 - at least I could not find the CompizConfig. Instead I install gconf-editor and found the following option:\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/scale/screen0/options/initiate_key\n\n", "Q: Cannot boot from live cd I have a Hcl notebook P38 PDC, the hard disk is completely blank.

Can someone please tell me what wrong am I doing or what else needs to be done. I am using a Toshiba pen drive 4Gb. I tried booting from the rescue mode but again had the same problem. Would be great if someone helps me out ASAP.\nThank you( for reading as well as for helping).\n\nA: Since you're able to get to the grub screen (to select failsafe), it sounds like you are booting to USB correctly. \nTry the alternative CD, and see if you have any luck. \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download\n\nA: It's likely that you are having issue seeing the drive.  This may be an AHCI issue or an issue with the way your BIOS is handling your hard drive mode.  Go into your bios and see what your hard drive mode is.  If you can change the mode to IDE you may have more luck.\nI will warn you however that if AHCI mode isn't enabled it reduces hot swap ability.  It being a laptop I don't forsee this as much of an issue, but thought I would let you know.\n\nA: \"I tried installing Ubuntu 11.04 as a .iso image from a cd but it did not boot.\"\nAre you copying the .iso image to the CD or simply burn the CD with the .iso image? If you are simply copying, it would not work. However, if you are burning the data of the image to your CD, it will work. Also check your BIOS setup.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with UBUNTU 13.04- my laptop would not boot from the live cd AT ALL...\nI found out that you have to burn the downloaded ISO image file to the cd/dvd as an image and not just as a normal file.\nThe boot up will then mount the image and boot up from it and ask if you want to try UBUNTU or INSTALL it. With the try option, UBUNTU will run from the live cd without affecting anything on you current system.\n", "Q: How do I reset GNOME to the defaults?

I have some play/pause, stop, next etc. keys on my Dell Vostro 1510. These interact with Banshee but don't with Amarok. How can I bind the latter to those keys?\n\nA: I also had to switch off the shortcut below so that the amarok global shortcut works.\nSystem Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Sound and Media > Play / Pause\n(it may differ a bit, I'm running a non-English system)\n\nA: Amarok is set up to use the X keycode \"Media play\" as a global shortcut for play/pause. Sometimes, however, your keyboard configuration may not be properly recognized for whatever reason - in which case, you can specify it manually. To do this, follow the instructions below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Amarok\n\n*Select Settings from the menu and choose the Configure shortcuts submenu.\n\n*Type \"play\" in the filter box. This will filter display all possible shortcuts that has the word \"play\" in it.\n\n\nYou will see a few items named something with \"play\", and one of them will be Play/pause. \n\nYou will also see three columns: Shortcut, Alternate and Global. The two first are valid only when Amarok is in focus - that means whenever you are inside Amarok and fiddling around. The Global keyboard shortcut, however, will work regardless of whether Amarok is minimized, in the notification area or you have it open.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the little triangle in the Global column for the play/pause entry. This may already have the words Media play shown (this is the current shortcut for this action - if you have a proper media keyboard, the play button will usually trigger this action in Amarok).\n\n*With the entry now expanded, click the button after \"Custom\" that says \"None\". When you have clicked it, it is in \"recording\" mode, so press the key you want to be assigned to this function. When it is released, it should show up on the button you just clicked, next to the text \"Custom\".

Now I want Rhythmbox to forget everything that I've imported.\n\nA: Close Rhythmbox and delete the Rhythmbox database in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml.\nIf you also want Rhythmbox to forget your library paths (the directories where it automatically looks for music), then you need to delete them from dconf:\ngsettings set org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb locations \"['file:///dev/null']\"\n\nYou can then set new paths in the Rhythmbox GUI, under Edit -> Preferences -> Music. \n(Note that\ngsettings reset org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb locations\n\ndoes not work correctly, since then Rhythmbox tries to be \"smart\" and uses your home directory as a default value.  Using /dev/null above prevents this; alternatively you could directly set the library paths using gsettings set).\n", "Q: Minitube not playing nor downloading: is it an Ubuntu-specific issue?

I'm currently using LUKS device encryption to secure several machines running Ubuntu. The security and integration is nice, but the performance is considerably less impressive than TrueCrypt, and I'd like to test drive it in real life. The only problem is: I've only seen TrueCrypt used for storage in an already-running OS, I haven't seen it configured for / partition. \nHas anyone done this or seen a tutorial I could check out on it?\n\nA: It's not possible, only Windows is supported by Truecrypts system encryption.\n", "Q: How to create a soft or symbolic link? I am installing p4v in /opt, but /usr/bin is on my path.  Is it possible to create a soft or symbolic link for p4v from /opt to /usr/bin, so I can just type \"p4v\" since /usr/bin is in my path?\n\nA: See man ln.\nTo create a symlink at /usr/bin/bar which references the original file /opt/foo, use:\nln -s /opt/foo /usr/bin/bar\n\nYou would need to apply the above command as root (i.e. with sudo).\n\nA: Check the software location by this. \nwhich application-name #replace for the application you are looking for\n\nfor example \nwhich skype\n\noutput will be this. \n/usr/bin/skype \n\nTo create the soft link. for example you want to create the soft link for skype on your desktop\nln -s /usr/bin/skype ~/Desktop/\n\nFor more information about ln. \nman ln\n\nor \nln --help\n\n\nA: The error is that you are writing the command wrong. The correct way is\nln -s /<full>/<path>/<to>/<file> /usr/local/bin\n\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2001697\n\nA: This template was more helpful for me than the above answers.  Probably not more correct, just less obfuscated:\nln -s <path/to/real/file-or-folder> <symlink path>\n\nJust replace the parts in <>'s\n\nA: ln -s -n ./TargetDirectory ./Nickname\n\n\nNote, this works if you both nodes are below you in the same tree. You can use relative notation\n\n\n*\n\n*-s command makes it a symbolic link\n\n*-n makes it possible de create a folder-type symlink\n\n\nA: If the 'p4v' executable is at /opt/bin/p4v, you can simply run:\nsudo ln -s /opt/bin/p4v /usr/bin/p4v\nsudo chmod ugo+x /usr/bin/p4v\n\nIt would be better to add /opt/bin (or wherever the executable is) to your path:\necho \"export PATH=\\$PATH:/opt/bin\" >> ~/.profile\nreset\n\n\nA: If it is saying target is not a folder, it means there are spaces in your folder names eg: New Folder has a space\nYou need to edit the path and add a backslash \\ after every space in the paths\neg: \nln -s /opt/bin /usr/var/New\\ Folder\n\n\nA: I have found that it is easier to go to where you want the link to be and then create the link using sudo ln -s /path/to/source/file, than doing ln -s target source. \nSo in your case I would do cd /usr/bin then sudo ln -s /opt/bin/pv4.

For normal\n  day to day\n         package management there are several frontends available, such\n  as apti‐\n         tude(8)  for  the  command line or synaptic(8) for the X Window\n  System.\n         Some options are only implemented in apt-get(8) though.\nSEE ALSO\n         apt-cache(8),  apt-get(8),  apt.conf(5),  sources.list(5), \n  apt_prefer‐\n         ences(5), apt-secure(8)\nDIAGNOSTICS\n         apt returns zero on normal operation, decimal 100 on error.\nBUGS\n         This manpage isn't even started.\n   See  <http://bugs.debian.org/apt>.  If you wish to report a bug\n\nin apt,\n         please see /usr/share/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt or the \n  reportbug(1)\n         command.\nAUTHOR\n         apt was written by the APT team .\nDebian GNU/Linux                 16 June 1998\n  apt(8)\n\nSo basically, if you have the man pages for apt-cache, apt-get, apt.conf, sources.list, apt-prefer-ences and apt-secure, you have the documentation.\nSee also : online man page\n\nA: The binaries provided by the apt package are apt-config, apt-key, apt-get, apt-cdrom, apt-cache, and apt-mark. Each command has its own manpage that you can get for example with man apt-get. In addition, further man pages describe archive authentification (man apt-secure) and the preferences (man apt_preferences). \nThe package apt-doc only provides the user guide in several languages (which you can find in /usr/share/doc/apt-doc), it does not offer much information for advanced usage.\n", "Q: How to move $HOME to an encrypted partition? I have an unencrypted $HOME (I used the very basic installation with no further partitioning and no encryption at all). Now I want to move my $HOME to an encrypted partition on an external drive (or move it there first and encrypt it later, doesn't matter).\nWhat are the steps I have to do assuming I have an unpartitioned drive? What I think is the main problem here for me: how do I mount the encrypted $HOME on login or startup?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT: This blog post is about the ecryptfs-migrate-home command. But now there is the problem: will it work for a user's home directory on an external drive mounted in /home?\n\nA: There are two popular options to encrypt the data in your home folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*using an encrypted block device between the physical disk and your filesystem: This method is known as encrypted partition, (full) disk encryption, LUKS or dm-crypt.\nThe filesystem /home, /home/user or /path/to/sensitive/data will be stored in the encrypted block device. Before mounting the filesystem, typically early in the boot process, the system will ask for the password.\nThis method typically requires to change the partition layout and is often used with LVM. If you want to go this route, I recommend finding a good tutorial (up-to-date with your Ubuntu version).\n\n*using an encrypted filesystem on top of your normal filesystem. This method is known as ecryptfs or \"Private\" directory.\nFor this setup, the existing partition table and filesystems are left untouched. The data, which should be encrypted, will be routed through the ecryptfs filesystem driver.\nYour system should already feature a Private directory, which works like this.\nTypically, your login password is used to generate the encryption password. In this case, you only have to type in the password once at the normal login prompt. The encryption \"just works\" transparently.\nYou can use ecryptfs for your whole home directory. It's straightforward if you create a new user at the command line.\nadduser --encrypt-home newusername\n\ncreates an encrypted home directory for newusername.\nThe wiki provides more information on this method.\nAs @dAnjou realized, there exists a script to enable ecryptfs for an existing user.\nSince ecryptfs works upon a filesystem, it does not matter, where the data is physically stored. Depending on the Ubuntu version or setup procedure, some ecryptfs meta data resides in /var/lib/ecryptfs. Mounting /home on external storage is possible and compatible with ecryptfs.\n\nA: If you have a fresh install it will make this easier for you. A good question is do you want encrypt your personal home folder or the whole home folder? You can mount the drive as the whole home or /home/user. I personally would set it up as a home/user. Use this video to set up the drive encryption. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4JYkZxnhJw One thing I noted in the video is the encryption is created when the partition is created. So any data is lost on that partition.\nYou can also encrypt the partiton following the information here. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\n", "Q: How do I update Ubuntu? How do I keep my Ubuntu install up-to-date with the latest versions of software?\n\nA: To keep your Ubuntu install up-to-date, run update-manager fairly frequently (read: weekly at the least).\nFor those of you who like the command line, the following will update your system.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade - that command will update the repositories (the software list) and then install the latest updates.\n\nA: Just to play pedant, I don't think James' quite covers the actual question (even though it's his!)\nThe question asks to update software to their latest versions but updating from the standard repositories will only get you the latest version in Ubuntu. And that assumes the software is repository controlled (eg not manually installed - eg a game from the Humble Indie Bundle).\nOnce a major version of Ubuntu is released, the applications in repositories usually only get updates if they have major problems (including serious regressions and most commonly security vulnerabilities). You can read all about this on the Stable Release Updates page. In short, if you're on a released version of Ubuntu, quite a lot of your software won't be the latest version - you'll have what has been processed and deemed important/stable enough for you to have by the Ubuntu maintainers.  \nIf you want to keep everything at its bleeding-edge, latest version, you need to find an alternate repo that has everything packaged up for you. Bleeding-edge software will cut you at some point so it's not really recommended and I don't think there are any projects that aim to keep everything brand-spanking-new for Ubuntu.\nIf you do need the latest everything, there are other distributions like Arch and Gentoo that form \"rolling releases\". Packages are updated as soon as people consider them stable. This equates to less testing and more frequent breakage... But that's what you asked for :)\n\nA: Load Update Manager. Click on Settings, enter your password, and select the Updates tab. Under Automatic Updates tick the box Check for updates and in the menu make your selection from Daily, Every two days, Weekly, Every fortnight.\nWhen there are updates available, Update Manager will make an appearance, usually a just a few minutes after starting the operating system, and you can choose to run the updates or to delay until later.\n\nA: If you're using an up-to-date version of Ubuntu, and haven't told things not to update themselves, the answer is pretty nice:\nYou're doing it already.\nJust hit the buttons that it tells you to hit when it tells you to hit them, and you'll always be up to date for ever and ever.\nHowever, if you'd like to manually update your system, you can do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*run update-manager fairly frequently (read: weekly at the least).\n\n*For those of you who like the command line, the following will update your system.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nthat command will update the repositories (the software list) and then install the latest updates.\n\nA: There is a manual method that is only for the experienced and fearless.\nOpen software sources, and change all entries to point to the incoming release.\nThen, manually apply the upgrade, or allow the system to update automatically.\nAgain I stress, this is not for the faint of heart or inexperienced.\n", "Q: Does dmcrypt/LUKS full disk encryption in kernel 3.0 have multi-core/multi-thread support? I've read a lot about how fast TrueCrypt 7.0 is with it's support for AES hardware acceleration and multi-core/multi-thread support. Will dmcrypt/LUKS offer the same performance enhancing features on a full disk encryption setup on Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: Yes!\ndmcrypt/LUKS does benefit from Intel AES hardware acceleration.\nSee this article for some benchmarks showing the advantages of AES-NI hardware acceleration.\n\nA: The answer is NO.\nThere is only 1 core being used. So a fancy 8 core or 4 core system won't be showing its full potential. And this post is 3 years old. And still no improvement on that.\n", "Q: How to host a video conference with VLVC? I just found out that you can use VLC and VLVC to hold video conferences between 2-10 people, and that sounds amazing, hopefully removing the heavy lean on Skype.\nCan anyone tell me how to set up VLVC for video conferencing? I can't seem to figure it out right now. I am sure it is easy, but I just seem to be stuck at the moment.\n\nA: This project is still in Beta. You got to http://sourceforge.net/projects/vlvc/ and install the plugin in vlc. When you run the plugin you can attach to the IP hosting the conference, or host one yourself. You will need to put yourself in the DMZ of your router so that you can host a conference or forward the chosen ports.\n", "Q: Toolbar And Unity in games I've searched the internet a few times now and can't find a answer that helps me.\nWhen I play games such as Dawn Of War, the toolbar on the top half of my screen won't go in the background and neither will Unity. \nSo I'm just hoping there's a way around this. \nI've just started using Ubuntu (11.04) and on all other fronts I'm very pleased with it. \nSo I'm hoping someone out there can help me. This little tweak to Ubuntu would make it make it an all around fantastic experience for a newbie like me.\n\nA: I usually encounter this while playing some games in fullscreen via wine.\nYou can try Alt+Tab or Win+Tab to switch some windows, and then return to the game.\nAlso, you can try playing in emulated virtual desktop (check Graphics tab in winecfg). Works best with the same size of your screen and unchecked \"Allow window manager to decorate the windows\" option.\nAlso, check Wine HQ for possible bugs/solutions in your version of Dawn Of War.\n", "Q: Can I create workspace-dependent command triggers?

That's a coordinate system which counts in positive numbers down and right , where 0,0 would be your top left workspace.\nBy knowing that, we can have a simple script that gets current coordinates, tests them, and executes appropriate command. The script bellow does that.\n#!/bin/bash\n  \nget_viewport()\n{\n  xprop -root -notype _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT  | \\\n      awk -F '=' '{ gsub(/\\ /,\"\");print $2 }'\n}\n\nget_viewport\n\ncase \"$(get_viewport)\" in \n\n   \"0,0\") notify-send 'You are in the top left viewport'\n            ;;\n   \"2732,768\") notify-send 'You are in the bottom right viewport'\n            ;;\n\nesac\n\nReplace notify-send commands with whichever action you want. Use nohup COMMAND  2>/dev/null &  to avoid commands  hanging the script (notify-send is an exception, hence did not add it there).\nUse the xprop -root -notype _NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT  to determine coordinates of each of your viewports.\nFinally, there should be no spaces in the case statement options, e.g. \"0,0\" works but \"0, 0\" will not.\n\nPython Version\nIntroduction\nThis version of the script performs the same function, but doesn't contain command line arguments or GUI elements for the sake of simplicity and usability.

S3TC is a patented graphics mechanism for compressing textures. It's so widely patented that distributions (Ubuntu included) does not ship it with its free drivers. Closed-source drivers have this enabled because the companies (AMD/Nvidia) pay the patent royalties and assume the liability.\nBut I'm currently using an Intel graphics chipset. Specifically, the i915. The drivers are completely free and open source. While I believe the hardware can handle S3TC, the drivers are those that shipped with Ubuntu (or through the updates) so S3TC is turned off.\nFrom what I read (fairly old posts) turning S3TC on requires getting the source for mesa, patching in S3TC, reconfiguring it and then recompiling it all. In short, it sounds like a mess.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this still the case?\n\n*Has somebody out there been nice and created a PPA with S3TC turned on?\n\n\nA: Install driconf and when you type driconf, a dialog box will appear. Use that dialog box to enable S3TC. That is what I did and my intel graphic card is able to now play some games with wine.\n\nA: As of 12.10, libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 is installed by default, providing this functionality.\n\nMesa does not require a rebuild to enable S3TC support, and hasn't for some time.  There are two options for S3TC\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting force_s3tc_enable=true in the environment to advertise S3TC support.  In this case, S3TC textures will be passed through to the hardware.  Mesa will not support compression of textures using S3TC, which is required by the GL extension spec, so things may misbehave.\n\n*Using the external libtxc-dxtn library for S3TC compression.  Mesa will attempt to load it if it exists, and provide full S3TC support.  This is available in xorg-edgers, at least. \n\nA: Maybe you are missing installing the correct libraries. If it is the libraries do the following:\nsudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n\n", "Q: What happened to the classic calendar applet? You know, the one that was in 10.04 and before, before Unity. The new one is missing so many nice features such as showing the location on a map, showing the night on said map and having an overall much nicer presentation of the various locations entered. I am traveling a lot and also communicating to people from other parts of the globe and I miss that overall presentation which was very neat and easy to read. The new one is cramped and dull. And there is no automatic sorting of places depending of time. And I like seeing the time differences (CST+6) so I can compute other times.\nAlso I now time and weather are two different things but having the local weather shown next to the location name was very nice.\nSo my question is:\nIs this the definitive look of the applet or are improvements planned for the following releases?\nand a sub-question:\nWhy change something that works?\n\nA: I can't speak for the future but for your secondary question it changed because it's essentially a different application. Ubuntu Classic (and by that I mean older versions of Ubuntu too) uses a gnome-panel applet and unity uses its own built-in clock widget.\nI've had a look through the filed bugs for Unity but can't seem to find anybody reporting this feature omission. If you want it back, you should probably start by filing a bug. The Unity maintainers can then consider the issue and interact with you accordingly.\n\nOn a sideways note, this isn't just a case of pulling some code across because Canonical makes things harder for themselves. Canonical likes to keep their projects' code covered by a contributor agreement, essentially allowing them to release their projects under any license (closed, public domain, etc) at their whim.\nThis means in order to pull features in from existing code (if that worked techically), they'd either taint the codebase with non-CCA-covered-code (arresting their ability to re-license) or they'd have to do a dark-room port (have somebody who hasn't seen the original gnome-panel applet's code, develop it from scratch).\n<plug> I had a rant about this on my blog quite recently. </plug>\n", "Q: How do I find out if there is a better driver for my WiFI card?

I created a 32-bit LiveUSB and booted it up after some fiddling with the BIOS, but I'm not sure how the partitioning should proceed.\nHere's a screenshot of the netbook's current unmodified partitions, via GParted:\n\nI have found this related question on AskUbuntu which talks about some of these partitions. I figure /dev/sda1 is where Windows resides, and /dev/sda2 is the recovery partition. /dev/sda3 seems to be the Windows D:\\ drive, which AFAIK doesn't contain anything important, and /dev/sda4 is, according to the other question, needed for the BIOS's \"Boot Booster\" option giving faster boot times.\nI'm still somewhat of a newbie when it comes to Linux partitioning, but here's my question: could I format /dev/sda3 and turn it into an extended partition, then manually set up an ext4 filesystem partition and a linux-swap partition in there using GParted, prior to continuing with a normal install through the installer? Would this be safe (or smart) to do, or would there be some better partitioning scheme you could recommend? I do know that there can only be a maximum of 4 primary partitions on one disk, so something would have to go. As it stands now, the installer only allows me to wipe the whole disk to be used by Ubuntu or specify partitions manually, which is a bit different from what I'm used to.\n\nA: I hope this is an answer to your question. What I would do is the following. It's based on an installation of ubuntu 11.04, but I think that the installation of ubuntu 10.04 will be much alike.\nAfter backuping your data, format /dev/sda3 using Gparted on the Live-USB and keep it unallocated. After the job is complete, exit Gparted and start the installation of ubuntu 10.04. The ubuntu 10.04-installer will recognise the unallocated disk space, and you will have an option to install it just there. Do this. Ubuntu itself will make this ext4 and will divide your free space in partitions like 'filesystem', 'swap', etcetera.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Backing up files from specific folders in rsync How can I specify specific files to include/exclude in grsync/rsync? \nCurrently, I use different operations to backup files from only specified folders. I want to do it now in 1 pass. I think I should be looking at the include/exclude options? \nSuppose I have a folder structure like\n/\n  /inc1\n    /inc1.1\n    /...\n  /inc2\n    /...\n  /exc1\n  files in root here ... \n\nI want to only backup files/folders from inc1 & inc2 how can I do it?\n\nA: You can use --include and --exclude options or for a backup process you may want to use --include-from so you can list the folders you want to back up in a file.\nFor example your file may be called includes.txt and save in your home directory.\nIt would contain\n  inc1/\n  inc2/\n\nAnd the rsync command to back up folders inc1 and inc2 in your home directory would be\nrsync $HOME --include-from=~/includes.txt /home/backup/\n\nrsync is very flexible, you are best off consulting the man page first and if you get stuck asking a more specific question.\n\nA: To include only specific directories, include them and their contents, then exclude *. If the directories aren't at the root, you need to include every directory leading to them. For example, to include only /source/inc1, /source/inc2 and /source/also/included:\nrsync -a --include='/inc1/***' --include='/inc2/***' \\\n         --include='/also' --include='/also/included/***' \\\n         --exclude='*' /source /target\n\nSee also a quick guide to common rsync filters.\n\nA: Maybe I'm missing something, but you can just specify those folders to rsync:\nrsync -Pav /inc1 /inc2 /path/to/backup/folder/\n\nThis will create:\n/path/to/backup/folder/inc1/\n/path/to/backup/folder/inc1/inc1.1/\n/path/to/backup/folder/inc1/...\n/path/to/backup/folder/inc2/\n/path/to/backup/folder/inc2/...\n\n", "Q: Key icon in system tray; what does it mean?

I like the look of Unity and I also like to use keyboard shortcuts. However, my impression is that in Ubuntu 11.04 it takes longer time for a program to start than compared to Ubuntu 10.10. \nFor example, if I hold Super and then press 1 then I expect the file manager to pop up almost immediately, but instead it takes a few seconds. Not much, but irritating. The hardware should not be the problem since my computer was new and state of the art one year ago (Sony VAIO with NVIDIA graphics driver).\nIs there any way to get a faster program start in Unity of Ubuntu 11.04? Or will this be taken care of in Ubuntu 11.10?\nAddition:\nMy computer has a Intel Core i5 processor (2.4 GHz), 4 GB memory, and NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics card. In my opinion, it is fair to say that this was state of the art one year ago and it is still a powerful computer. (The script \"/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\" gives a definitive yes that Unity is supported.)\nThe computer runs a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 and I have not activated any extra fancy stuff. \nMy question is if Unity 3D in Ubuntu 11.04 can be tweaked to run faster.\n\nA: Have you considered installing Preload?\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nPreload is a daemon that monitors the programs you often run and partially loads them into memory. It particularly helps me with heavy programs such as Inkscape.\n\nA: In my experience it depends on what program you are launching, and in all honesty the perceived difference in start up time is likely just in your head. For example, Midori starts immediately for me, and Nautilus takes sometimes a full minute!\nIt would help you to run the applications that take a long time to start from the terminal and see what they are outputting, as often times the program does some other things before you see the application window pop up. If the program is taking a while to start from the terminal, and outputs a lot of information, then you would know that it is just doing something extra.\nAlso keep in mind that it might be a change in the way the filesystem works that causes the delay.\n", "Q: Installing Trac with Subversion i am installing trac with subversion while installing i have error, i am following this link \"http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/Ubuntu-11.04-Subversion\"....when i give the database string it gives the following error , could anybody please help....??\nDatabase connection string [sqlite:db/trac.db]> mysql://trac:yourpassword@localhost/trac\n\nCreating and Initializing Project\nInitenv for '/var/tracprojects/YourProject' failed. \nFailed to create environment.\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/tracprojects/YourProject'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Trac-0.12-py2.7.egg/trac/admin/console.py\", line 413, in do_initenv\n    options=options)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Trac-0.12-py2.7.egg/trac/env.py\", line 221, in __init__\n    self.create(options)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Trac-0.12-py2.7.egg/trac/env.py\", line 382, in create\n    os.mkdir(self.path)\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/tracprojects/YourProject'\n\n\nA: Is /var/tracprojects/YourProject the directory name you passed to trac-admin?\nAccording to the instructions on the page you posted, you are meant to create that directory before calling trac-admin (the two commands before hand create the directory and set its permissions).

Has anybody got any idea what would be needed to have a working external GPU system (eGPU) under Linux? I've just seen this post of a DIY eGPU system:\nhttp://forum.tabletpcreview.com/hardware/40268-diy-egpu-tablet-pcs-experiences-benchmarks-setup-ect.html\nI found this mentioned which I think is also relevant:\n\nMy system has switchable graphics. Can I still do a eGPU?\nYes you can. Setup 1.x's (Video card->Hybrid Graphics.dedicated=off)\n  allows the dedicated graphics component to be completely disabled on\n  Series-5 or older chipsets, freeing up 32-bit resources to host the\n  desktop eGPU. If your primary video card is a Intel 4500MHD, HD or\n  HD3000 then can even do a x1.Opt NVIDIA setup.\n\n\nA: I can confirm that it works in 12.04. Tested with PE4H + EC2C on a Thinkpad X220, using an Nvidia GTX 560 Ti. The tricky part was getting a working xorg.conf.\nI needed the Nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nYou need to find the correct PCI bus for the graphic card.\nlspci gave me:\n05:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF110 [GeForce GTX 560 Ti] (rev a1)\n\nSo in the \"Device\" section of xorg.conf, I set:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    BusId          \"PCI:5:0:0\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\nEndSection\n\nThen use nvidia-settings after a reboot or an Xorg restart to configure the monitor(s) resolution(s).\nIt should be noted that it works much better in Windows than Linux and I had to disable Compiz because it lagged so much. I will update if I can get both cards (HD3000 + Nvidia) at the same time.\n\nA: It's an interesting idea and I can't see why it wouldn't work on a technical level because Linux does support ExpressCard devices (as PCIE) so the riser on the other end should work and it should detect the graphics card too. From there it's just a case of using the nvidia drivers.\nHowever there are some things that might give you grief:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might need to manually add the module for ExpressCard:\nsudo modprobe pciehp pciehp_force=1\n\nYou can do this automatically too.\n\n*Assuming the built-in graphics card isn't Nvidia, you might have a battle of drivers and configurations. Nvidia drivers still require a fairly static Xorg.conf file so you're going to need to manually set up two configurations, one for the onboard (so it knows what to do if there's no external card) and a layout for when it is present.\nI'm over-simplifying this - it could be a real headache to get X behaving.\n\n*You won't be able to hotplug this configuration. You'll need to restart X (and all the applications it has loaded) in order to switch graphics cards.\n\n*I don't think you'll be able to render things through the external card onto the built-in screen; aka you'll need an external monitor. The page you link to has it displaying on the laptop's screen but I don't see how it could be without some sort of extra hardware hack. Edit: I see from that post that it uses Optimus. This part won't work in Linux; you'll need an external monitor.\nI wouldn't spend too much money on this if you're not sure it'll work.\nIf you've got $130 that you won't mind losing (or trying to recoup on ebay) start with the ExpressCard riser and a dirt-cheap, lowest-end Nvidia card. If it's low-end enough, you might be able to get by without a proper ATX PSU. See if it works... If it does, buy a proper PSU and a nice graphics card and rock on.\nAnd if you do get it working, please document it somewhere!\n\nA: External GPU on older laptop with Ubuntu 18.04.1 and Windows 10 Pro 1909\nMany older laptops still have an acceptable CPU, but are lacking in the\nGPU/graphics area. Hardware is available to allow a desktop GPU to be easily\nattached to the laptop, at a much lower price than a new laptop. Most\nexternal GPU hardware connects with USBc/Thunderbolt, which is not available\non most older laptops. Other options, like an M2 or an expresscard connection\nare available, and will provide the desired graphics upgrade.  \nThe EXP GDC Beast adapter converts from a laptop's expresscard slot to an\nexternal PCIe slot, allowing plugin of a desktop GPU. Other versions are\navailable using an M2 adapter, but to attach those, the latop case needs to be\nopened. Older issues reported with the adapter have been fixed with current\nLinux kernels and Windows releases. Setup for an external GT 640 GPU (1GB\nvideo memory) was trivial: In the BIOS/UEFI settings, turn off the discrete\ngraphics and ensure that the expresscard slot is enabled.\nHardware\nThe laptop used was a Lenovo W520, with Nvidia 1000M Quadro graphics and an\nexpresscard slot. This is a 2011 64 bit UEFI machine, pre secure boot, dual\nbooting 64 bit Ubuntu 18.04.1 (kernel 4.15) and 64 bit Windows 10 Pro 1909\nbuild 18363.628. The adapter was a Semoic Express Card Mini PCI-E version\nExpresscard V8.0 EXP GDC Beast PCIe PCI-E PCI laptop external independent\nvideo card dock ($40.00 on sale). The power supply was a Dell D220P-01 power\nsupply P/N:MK394 ($20.00). The GPU was a 1GB video memory GT 640. Consider\ngetting/making a case to keep fingers/cables out of the GPU fan.\nUbuntu Setup\nShutdown the Ubuntu 18.04 running on the internal Nvidia Quadro using the 390\ndriver. On the laptop, plug in the expresscard on the adapter cable. On the\nadapter, plug in the GPU, and the 6 pin power supply cable. The cable to\nsupply additional power to the GPU from the adapter was not used. Plug in the\npower supply, whose light stays yellow until the laptop is powered, then it\nturns green. Start the laptop and select the BIOS/UEFI settings. Ensure the\ngraphics mode is set to internal (not discrete or automatic). Ensure that the\nexpresscard slot is enabled. Save and exit. Start the laptop, it will find the\nnew hardware, and use the existing Nvidia 390 driver (the latest one offered\nfrom the standard repositories) on the laptop's display. No additional modules\nneeded to be loaded, no xorg.conf was needed, and no kernel options like\npci=nocrs were used.\nIf a monitor is attached to the external GPU, it will display a screen\npositioned to the right of the laptop's display. Adjust the screen positions\nin the Settings/Display section. Now run Software and Updates, select the\nAdditional Drivers tab, and update the Nvidia drivers to the now offered 345\nversion. Reboot, and Ubuntu should be using the 345 drivers for the GT 640\nGPU.  Shutting down the laptop will depower the GPU, and put the power supply\ninto standby (yellow light).\nWindows Setup\nReview the setup video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0YMBvNFgyE The most\nvaluable part is warning of the long wait with no progress bar on the\nautomatic Windows Nvidia device install). (Plug everything in), boot Windows,\nlet it find the new device, and let it update, drivers. There is no progress\nbar, so be patient and let it finish. Reboot, and the new device should be\nseen and used. The laptop screen will be used and if a monitor is attached to\nthe GPU, it will display a second screen to the right of the laptop's display.\nNo errors were encountered in either setup. Note that the internal Quadro\n1000M is a 2GB card, so GPUs up to 2GB probably will not have any problems on\nthis W520. GPUs with larger video memories might have issues. Machines\noriginally released with 32 bit OSes (like the Lenovo W520), might have\nproblems with the PCI buffering at the top of the lower 4G of memory.\nSolutions are available on support sites like\nhttps://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/fix-dsdt-override-to-correct-error-12/\n", "Q: How to automount a gvfs file system on logon I configured a remote folder in nautilus. I always need this remote folder, so I created a symbolic link to it in my home folder: ln -s ~/.gvfs/remote_folder ~/remote_folder.\nThough, when I first boot the computer this folder is not mounted, and I have to access it through nautilus in order to have it available in ~/remote_folder.\nWhat should I do to have this folder mounted on log on?\n\nA: First install gvfs-bin package:\nsudo apt-get install gvfs-bin\n\nthen mount URI you need. For example:\ngvfs-mount 'archive://file%253A%252F%252F%252Ftmp%252Ftest.tar/'\n\nto test it:\nls -la ~/.gvfs/test.tar/\n\nto unmount it, just call:\ngvfs-mount -u 'archive://file%253A%252F%252F%252Ftmp%252Ftest.tar/'\n\nNote, that there is no man pages. for this package. To learn more, list available binaries via:\ndpkg -L gvfs-bin\n\nand then use --help option, for example:\ngvfs-mount --help\n\n\nA: I usually do permanent mounts through fstab. You have to enter something like \n//servername/folder HOME/remote_server cifs username=XXXX,password=YYYY 0 0\n\nin your /etc/fstab. Since you haven't said anything about what kind of remote partition I gave an example of samba share\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*MountWindowsSharesPermanently\n\n*fstab\nThe second option may be using autofs, see the Ubuntu help wiki page for help.\nEDIT: Thank you @con-f-use for reminding me this one. You can add bookmarks from nautilus only. Go to File > Connect to Server... on nautilus and you will be presented with dialogue window where you have the option to add a bookmark of desired name. Just check the add bookmark option and enter the bookmark name. But I think it starts the mounting only after you click the bookmark unlike gigolo.\n\n\nA: If you do not want to use /etc/fstab (e.g. bad on multi-user PCs, no root access) or don't want to save your user password to a text file in your home folder (e.g. no encrypted file system) using gvfs-mount smb://$SERVERIP/$SHARE < ~/.smbcredentials_gvfs,\nrun this shell script on startup (or whenever you want):\n#!/bin/bash\nUSERID=`id -u $USER`; # Needed in 14.04\nSHARE=exampleshare # Example\nSERVERIP=192.168.2.101 # Example\nnautilus smb://$SERVERIP/$SHARE & # Mount the share using nautilus. You need to have your password saved permanently\nrm ~/network_$SHARE # prepare symbolic link (Example)\nln -sf /run/user/$USERID/gvfs/smb-share\\:server\\=$SERVERIP\\,share\\=$SHARE ~/network_$SHARE # Directory in Ubuntu 14.04\nsleep 2 # Nautilus needs some time to mount. Killing nautilus without waiting time does not mount the share\npkill nautilus\n\nThis mounts the shares you want and uses the nautilus (or Ubuntu) password saving mechanism (does not work in SSH though).\n\nA: Shell\nYou could use the mount command in a start up script and put that in the Startup Application Preferences. mount is perfectly capable of mounting remote file systems (if you provided it with the right options and all necessary packages installed).\nAn alternative to mount in your startup script is gvfs-mount . You can mount nautilus-type URIs with that - just like nautilus does. It is installed by default on most Ubuntu systems.\nExample usage:\ngvfs-mount 'ftp://user@www.your-server.com/folder'\n\nAdding the -u option unmounts the argument, -l lists all mounted file systems, --help gives you more options.\nFinally the file /etc/fstab is usually used to mount file systems statically. If your remote server is reliable you might want to take a look at fstab. It will slow down your boot time drastically if the server is slow or offline, but it has the advantage of making the file system available quite soon (before gnome or X are even loaded, e.g. for use in scripts). For more information you can type man fstab.\nGUI way\nCheck out Gigolo . It has the capability of auto-mounting a bookmark, whenever the bookmarked filesystem is present.\nsudo apt-get install gigolo   # or use the install link above\n\nRun gigolo. There is an option in the preferences that puts it into autostart and another to activate the tray icon. Check both. Then add your bookmark.\n\n", "Q: can't ping from virtualbox ubuntu server --nat connection i set up an ubuntu server in virtual box following these and these instructions.My connection worked,also ssh .\n Then, i signed up in dyndns.com ,i configured the router ,but in the port forward i changed the 2222 port to 80 because it couldn’t forward from 2222.My port is open and accepting connections but i don’t have any more connection from the server in the virtual box. \nFrom virtual box settings->network->port forwarding , i use:\n Host IP :127.0.0.1 , Host port :80 , Guest Port :22 ,Guest IP : its empty.\nI am not sure if i am using right the address in /etc/network/interfaces , i use 192.168.0.2 and also this address i use for the firewall rules in the router.\nAlso,in the server /etc/resolv.conf i put that address and in  /etc/mysql/my.cnf.\nI can ping that address but nothing more.(of course neither ssh works)\nThank you\n\nA: I would change your network connection settings (\"Devices\" -> \"Network Adapters...\") from NAT to \"Bridged Adapter\". You will want your virtual box to get an IP Address from your router and not a separate one from the host machine.\n\nThis should allow you to use only the router's configuration to poke a port directly to your virtual box on the network.\n\nA: You mentioned that you changed your forwarding port from 2222 to 80.  According to VirtualBox in their description of NAT Limitations that won't work:\n(https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged)\n\nForwarding host ports < 1024 impossible:\nOn Unix-based hosts (e.g. Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X) it is not possible\n  to bind to ports below 1024 from applications that are not run by\n  root.

It then warned me that I should increase the partition size within the guest VM.\nLooking at the disk usage analyzer inside of Ubuntu, it only currently sees the original 20 GB.  How do I increase this to the 40 I allocated?\n\nA: As it says, you need to increase the partition. Resizing the virtual disk, just changes how big partitions can be. You can't resize an active filesystem so the easiest way to do this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the VM to a LiveCD ISO of Ubuntu (what you installed from should do but a later/earlier ISO will work too)\n\n*When asked click Try Ubuntu\n\n*Load gparted aka Gnome Partition Editor.

The solution for this problem was to call xterm from the gnome-terminal, and then start alsamixer in the xterm. xterm worked great for alsa mixer.\n\n*Somehow, I experimented a lot in alsa mixer. I think that the final solution was to change the capture device from digital to analog microphone. In other words, I changed everything that said \"digital\" to analog.

Stupid of me not to check. I currently run 32 bit Ubuntu 10.04. The issue is that I wish now to migrate to Natty 11.04 64 bit. I know that I will have to uninstall and reinstall.\nCan someone list down the steps also how do I do a seamless migration where all the applications which I have so painstakingly installed get retained also what about the little customizations I may have done. Fundamental question what will I gain with 64 bit or is it wise to stick to 32 bit with PAE. I have 8GB RAM on my machine..\n\nA: There is a way to do it using apt and dpkg (there was a debian tutorial which can be adapted), but it's isn't worth it (it's mostly for very advanced users and there is a lot of risk involved).\nIf your /home/ is on another partition just reinstall the system and use home directory to keep all your settings. If it isn't - backup your settings and install 64bit version.\nAs for the programs you have. The combination of:\ndpkg --get-selections > /backup/installed-software.log\nand on your new system:\ndpkg --set-selections < /backup/installed-software.log\n(with a few minor modifications for 32bit libs) will do.\nIs it worth it? Yes it is, not because it's faster, but because in a few years 32bit version will become outdated, deprecated and ultimately - abandoned. Let's face it - having 4-8 GB RAM isn't that much nowadays, I'm writing this using 16GB RAM computer, which wasn't all that expensive. Netbooks are suddenly capable of using 64bit distro and the market of 32bit-only intel/amd processors is shrinking.\n\nA: I would suggest you to take in consideration the comment of @djeikyb and perform some research before switching. The information provided over the net and answers like those documented in this question: Should I install 64-bit Ubuntu if my hardware supports it? should be also considered.\nI haven't noticed a major benefit when switching to a 64 bit version, for the Desktop usage (home and office), there are probably some benefits for multitask and gaming but in my needs and experience using both 32 and 64 bit versions, the difference is not such a major prize.

I've a Samsung Galaxy mini with Android 2.2. Kies, the software provided by Samsung to manage my phone, doesn't run on linux,. I've tried to run it on wine, but it doesn't work at all.\nIs there any way i can get this running on wine?\n\nA: Yeah it's a major pain in the arse (speaking as somebody who has tried everything). Wine doesn't work reliably with things that need hardware connections. If you're trying to upgrade your phone's firmware, it's just plain not worth the risk.\nVirtualBox (with Windows installed within, and the USB plugin installed) would normally be a viable option but for some reason VBox really hates my Galaxy S2. If you can get this to work, that's great.\nFor upgrading firmware I turned to Heimdall. This is essentially an open source replacement for Samsung's Odin tool (that isn't officially available to the public). I had success with this but I'm not sure it supports your phone.\nFailing that, borrow a friends Windows laptop and install Keis. I tried this after VirtualBox failed but Samsung's 64bit drivers are awful. Plain wouldn't work. I think they've updated them since but it was too late for me. If you have easy access to a proper install of Windows you should probably try this first. \n\nA: I got Kies to work on my new Galaxy Note N7000 (still Gingerbread) with my Dell Dimension using Ubuntu 12.04 using Chromium, but only one way ie using the desktop as master and GN as slave, not the reverse.

The browser loaded Kies which gave access to the mobile SD card for upload and download. \nMy destop is an older model and doesnt have wifi capability. seems to work OK although access.)  It's not full desktop-mobile integration or syncing, but it's better than nothing and simpler than transferring single files with Bluetooth.  \nWine refused to install the Kies executable on the desktop and complained that the package was faulty. \n\nA: It works fine for my Galaxy S2 through Chrome OS.

In order to view a page that uses O3D, it looks like I need some sort of plugin for Chrome/Chromium/Firefox. However, it seems like the only way to even get the plugin running in Chrom(ium) is to build the whole thing myself.\nIs there any way to get my hands on a precompiled binary?\nAnd how come the version of Firefox that ships with Ubuntu does not have native support for O3D content when the Windows version of Firefox ships with it out of the box?\n\nA: After spending a considerable amount of time puzzling over this, I decided to just go ahead and compile it anyway. To make it easier for those who should want to try this in the future, I have prepared a small (yeah, right!) Bash script to automate the entire process.\n\nShort version: if you just want me to give you a command to run, then here it is:\nwget http://files.quickmediasolutions.com/install_o3d ; chmod 755 install_o3d ; ./install_o3d\n\nNote: you will be prompted for your root password in order to install some packages.\nThe script may take a few minutes to run (or even up to an hour) but in the end you should end up with a package (or two) in /tmp/o3d/o3d_root/o3d/build/out/Debug/. This can then be installed for O3D support.\n\nLong version: Google doesn't seem to provide precompiled binaries (that I could find at least) so I visited this page and got the instructions for building it and began constructing a Bash script to perform the actions.\nFirst the script makes sure that you have the right packages on your system. It also checks to see if you provided a path as a parameter which is used to store the repositories (/tmp/o3d is used if no parameter is specified). Then it checks out Google's depot_tools and adds it to PATH (not permanently though). Then the script uses gclient to fetch all of the code from different repositories (believe me, it downloads a lot - like over 500MB of stuff). Unfortunately the DEPS file in the o3d_root/o3d folder seems to have the wrong revision number for breakpad so my script patches it on the fly and re-syncs.\nThen the long and tedious process of building the plugin begins. Depending on the speed of your system this can take anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes.\nWhen the process is done, you will find the packages in o3d_root/o3d/build/out/Debug/. Note that the build process may report an error and stop. But as far as I can tell, the error can be ignored because the packages are already built at that point.

I'm flying to China soon for a long time, so I'd like to know how to configure my Ubuntu 11.04 so I can access forbidden websites (like Facebook)\nI've heard about VPN and Proxy, but I don't know how to work with those. What would be a good solution for me?\n\nA: Another solution that may work well, download Tor with Vidalia, when you install it you can install a Tor button in Firefox, which allows you to use Firefox through the Tor proxy. The only thing to keep in mind is most of the Tor proxies seem to be in Germany, so when you open web pages you'll have to change the language to English, or whatever your language of choice is, which would be somewhere on the web page.\nI say Tor because it's a GREAT proxy, and it very purpose is to provide Internet freedom to countries like China, Iran, etc., it changes your proxy IP every couple minutes, it's a really good service, and really easy to use.\nOne thing to keep in mind, with the latest versions of Ubuntu it seems that when you start Vidalia it will say it fails to connect to the Tor network, but it's because Ubuntu seems to start Tor on system start when it's installed, so if Vidalia says it can not connect, this is probably why, in which case you will not even need to start Vidalia, just start Firefox and make sure the Tor button is ON so that you connect through the proxy. If Vidalia says it successfully connects to the Tor network, then that means your Ubuntu is not making it start automatically, and you will need to start Vidalia every time you use it.\nI hope this helps, and I hope it's not too confusing.\n\nA: I am a native Chinese，and there are many ways to access Facebook. Unfortunately, lots of the documentation is in Chinese.\n\n\n*\n\n*I use wallproxy — a plugin — to access Facebook. It's free and fast.  \n\n*freegate (自由门), 逍遥游 and so on. They're free, but not fast, and sometimes not available.\n\n*firefox+tor. tor is can securely browse the internet, but is slow.\n\n*VPN. VPN costs, but is fast.\n\n\nA: If you have a home server running an ssh server, or maybe a friend's (nothing fancy needed) then you can connect to that, and use it as your own proxy:\nssh -fND :8000 your.ip.address\n\nThen configure firefox to use a socks proxy on 127.0.0.1:8000.\nOf course, it's only as fast as your broadband upload speed, but it's free and unlikely to be on any blacklist.\n\nA: Configuring a VPN is pretty simple. Open up the Network Connections dialogue and hit the VPN tab, as below:\n\nThat leaves two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need a VPN to connect to. These are widely available but cost money. Note that some if not all of these might be blocked by China (for obvious reasons). You might need to rent your own server (eg from a company like Linode) and install your own VPN server. You could just use a Socks proxy over SSH if that's what you end up doing - Much easier and should work for most things.\n\n*Is this legal in China? I personally don't care how many of China's laws we break on Ask Ubuntu because we're not in China. I think their firewall is a horrible incursion on people's natural right to free uncensored information and that China use it to suppress their citizens. In short, I think this question is fine on here.\nBut do be conscious that if you're breaking laws in China, and they find out (which they might), they might take legal action. And given China's record for open and fair judicial process, this could result in a 10 minute hearing followed by 10 years of wondering what you'd be doing if you didn't need to check Facebook.\nI'm not dropping the super-downer to put you off - just be careful.\n\nA: Try to use Tor Browser.

To reduce bandwidth consumption, I'm going through a local apt-cacher proxy, but it's possible that someone may have tampered with the packages cached on that proxy server. Or there may even be a transparent apt proxy along the line somewhere. Will I get a warning if the packages are not the correct ones? How does updating my apt cache (sudo aptitude update) affect this?\n\nA: You might need to consider the following situation when it comes to apt repository security. You will find your answer below.\nYou are adding an untrusted repository\nSince anyone can create a private-public key pair, so just validating the downloaded contents or apt-index with the public key won't solve the problem when the author of the repository and the owner of the key puts malicious software in the repository.\nHe would create a key pair. Sign the contents with his private key, then upload the contents to the repository and then upload his public key\nThen you add the repository, download his public key and then try to check. Apt would verify it without issuing warning messages. You might feel you are secure, but you are not. Are you sure you believe the person who has uploaded the content?\nYou added a repository which has content uploaded by a person you know\nThis might seem safe. You know the person's name and see that he has signed the repository contents and also the index. In this case too you are insecure. Anyone can impersonate the name. \nIn this case you need to verify the public key. You should be knowing that person's public key and should be sure about it. If you know the person and see that the repository needs a different public key for validating the contents then you should not trust that repository. \nYou should know the Person's name and his public key pair together to validate the authenticity of the repository. If any of them is wrong, don't trust the repository.\nThis is the reason why geek and hacker circles have key-signing parties where they meet in person, shoe each other valid identity proof and then establish trust\nYou know the person, have the correct public key, but apt shows warnings\nThis might be the case when you are trying to add the repository, but your computer is not getting the correct apt URL. This might be the situation where your DNS is not working properly and someone is trying to trick you into adding the wrong repository by DNS cache poisoning. \nIf you get a apt warning even when you have the correct public key, then ABORT. Don't go forward. This third case is usually very rare and you should not be worried about encountering this situation.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n*\n\n*When you want to add a repository and you want to be very sure you\nare adding the correct repository, you need to know the person who\nhas uploaded the content and should be sure about his public key.\n\n*Validate the repository only against his public key and not the one\nwhich repository owner asks you to verify against. This is the\nsafest mechanism. As mentioned above, it is NOT safe even if apt\ndoesn't give warnings when adding a repository. The contents might\nbe malicious. \n\n*Even if you are using a well known repository and then\napt complains, then it means that you are not adding the correct\nrepository. You are NOT SAFE.\n", "Q: Flash video gets stuck often I use Ubuntu 11.04, the flash videos gets stuck frequently.

However, when I installed it, it wouldn't work. I logged in using Ubuntu Classic, and installed the proprietary graphics driver, hoping this would make it work, but it didn't.\nChoosing \"ubuntu\" or \"ubuntu classic\" from the login screen yields to the same thing: gnome2 without unity.\nHow do I enable Unity?\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with an integrated video driver. When you use another driver for your computer it is recommended to remove the native drivers. \nMake sure you have installed the driver of your video card. (If it is an NVidia card, you must have the Xserver installed too). \nThen, you can remove the native driver of Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nThis worked for me. Tell me if you have any problems.\n", "Q: e4300 Mouse Click/Paste While Typing I have a Dell e4300 that is having some irregular mouse driver issues with a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04 x64.  I have used other versions of Ubuntu without issue.   Windows works fine, so it appears the hardware is working properly.  This leads me to believe a driver issue, however I am in need of some direction.\nKeep in mind that all this is with a fresh install.  No Docking Station, Only a USB Microsoft Intellimouse.  These issues occur with/without the mouse connected.\nIssue Scenario 1:\nWhen I am typing my password to login to the box, if I place the mouse cursor at a location on the left side of the password window, I can type the password normally until I type to the right of the mouse.  At that point, every keypress moves the cursor to the mouse location, then inputs the key.  If I move the mouse outside of the text box, the focus is removed from the text field after each keypress.  This allows one character to be entered at a time. I can login successfully if the mouse is moved to the very right of the text field.\nIssue Scenario 2:\nOnce logged in, I will often be required to press a key on the keyboard to be able to click on something/anything within Gnome.  The keyboard press does not seem to actually input anything, just allows the mouse to click. \nIssue Scenario 3:\nWhen I attempt to highlight a group of text, the OS automatically will copy the text.  When I attempt to type,  the mouse would take the cursor focus (similar to Scenario 1), and also copy that previous text.  If I attempt to type multiple characters, it will paste the information at the mouses location within the text field multiple times.\nI have tried:\nto Reinstall.\nUpdated all patches\nload various drives through the software\nI can get around Linux/Terminal, so I do not consider myself new.  However I am certainly not a pro.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: Just as an follow-up close this issue, it appears that there was failing hardware - Ubuntu was just more sensitive.  Windows eventually exhibited issues as well, although different.  \nAlthough the issue appeared to be with the track pad, ultimately it was the replacement of the keyboard/pointer stick mouse that resolved the issue.  The keyboard does connect into the track pad assembly on this model prior to connecting to the laptops motherboard.\nThanks.\n", "Q: How can I have inertia scrolling for my touchpad? I'd like to have inertia scrolling for my touchpad, how can I do this, thanks!\n\nA: Well. First you have to know that inertial scrolling is patented by Apple. So it is almost impossible to have the same software installed. Then, as far as I know. The touchpad of an Apple laptop uses another technology than other brand laptops. The Apple touchpad's laptops can identify multitouch.\n\nA: I believe the closest we have in Ubuntu is the 'Natural Scrolling' by Chalarampos. Natural Scrolling allows the direction of scrolling to be toggled.\n\nNatural Scrolling has the following dependencies: (Click on the link to install)\ncouch-db python-desktopcouch-application gawk\nThen download the .deb file and install it.\ndl.dropbox.com/u/1111373/NaturalScrolling/naturalscrolling_0.2.4_all.deb\n"]
