["Q: Is it just me or anyone think Ubuntu 14.10 is... \"very inconvenient, difficult\" to use :| In my case, the new Gedit version has no outline border (like a plain white piece of paper) and it bugs my eyes.\nThe Nautilus file manager, for some unknown reasons? My left click can no longer create a \"new txt file\" at that location so I end up using Gedit to write the some text first then link it to a location to save instead of the \"old way left click\".\nIn some situations, after typing something in Gedit and minimize the program Windows, I cannot click at the Desktop icons anymore. It just like the desktop is frozen!\nIn general, the update well I don't know much about the differences but the Gedit and Nautilus file manager are disasters in this version (14.10) @_@\n\nA: maybe you can try XFCE4 desktop (Xubuntu). it's lightweight, uses mousepad, and Thunar file manager which is the best file manage I've used so far. you can install the Xubuntu desktop from software center.\n\nA: Install Sublime Text and you will never look back at Gedit again!\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sublime-text\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Won't turn swap on at boot I'm using ubuntu as a hypervisor with my production OSes running in VMware.\nSince I installed everything onto an SSD, I placed the swap file off on a data HDD during install. Once I got everything setup, I needed to move the swapfile to a different section of a different physical HDD.\nBeing honest, I know enough about linux to get it to boot. I'm a windows power user who is completely flummexed trying to get this to work. I had no problems getting my virtual XP & 8 machines to use pagefiles I setup on HDDs even though their virtual machine files are stored on the SSD.\nHow do I get the swap space to turn on at boot. I have 14gb's of RAM, but VMware wants a swap file anyways. With terabytes of HDD space, I have no problem allocating a partition for this use, and without any other ideas, I used teh standard windows practice of as much swap space as you have ram.\nSorry for the long winded question.\n\nA: Add the following line to your /etc/fstab to activate the swap partition at boot.  \n/dev/sdx  none    swap    sw     0       0\n\n\nA: You can use swapfile or swap partition - your choice.\nIf not much use  - I think swapfile will be enough.\nAnyway - you have to create one of whatever size you need.\nSay - 1GB, just for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*create the empty file of 1GB size:\n\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576\n\n\n*The best change permissions to allow only root to use it:\n\n\nchown root:root /swapfile\nchmdo 600 /swapfile\n\n\n*make it swap\nmkswap /swapfile\n\n*also add it to /etc/fstab if you want it mounted automatically:\n/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0\n\n*enable swap on that file\nswapon /swapfile\nOf course you can locate it somewhere else, not necessarily in the root filesystem, and reflect it in the commands above.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Windows Dual boot on the same drive problem Here's what I did\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an SSD and regular hard drive\n\n*I installed Ubuntu 13.10 on SSD and Windows on the regular hard drive\neverything is in harmony\n\n*Then created another partition on the SSD and installed Windows on that partition\n(because Windows on the regular hard drive is giving me horrible performance)\n\n*Now my Thinkpad T430 will boot directly into Windows\nMy questions are \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I still boot into my Ubuntu? because I need to retrieve important files.\n\n*If the above is not doable, then Can I still boot into the Windows on the regular hard drive? I made a backup of ubuntu there. I should still retrieve files from that backup. \nAny help, feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated\nthanks so much\nShawn\n\nA: Your Windows installation overwrote MBR with its own data - hence it boots directly to Windows.\nYou have to reinstall grub in MBR and then add your Windows to the menu in it, the best.\nIn order to do that you can use rescue/live cd to boot into Linux.\nIn case you only want to retrieve your data from Linux partition you also can use LiveCD or basically do that in your Windows, using some tools to read Linux filesystem(s) - I guess it would be ext2/3/4.\n", "Q: Routing Problem OpenVPN / KVM I've set up a rented root server with KVM and OpenVPN.

Packages do their best to either be backwards compatible or migrate user's settings so that everything continues to work seamlessly after an upgrade. However this can be hard to test and so a frequent source of bugs.\nTo confirm this, create a new user and log back in as that user. If the problem is gone you know it's one of your regular user's settings that's doing it.\nAlternatively if you're familiar with command line you can test with same user:\n- log out + log back in using the console (Ctrl-Alt-F1)\n- rename your home folder and create a new one\n- log back in and see if you can replicate the issue\nIf that's the case first backup your home directory then you can either:\n\n\n*\n\n*start putting your config files back (the .files in your home dir, ls -d ~/.??* )\nand see which one is triggering it (do a binary search if there's a lot).

I tried to install ubuntu landscape openstack in virtual machine for test purposes and to undrestand how does it work, but it does not work.\nI followed the official ubuntu tutorial\nBuild OpenStack with conjure-up | Download | Ubuntu.com\nFirstly, i choosed the Landscape option, I waited for 3 hours and it was blocked in \"Creating KVM for juju state server\" step. So i cancelled the installation and relaunched a new install but i choosed option \"Single\" instead of landscape.\nWith single option, it was blocked in \"Initializing Environnement\" step.\n\nWhat's wrong in what i did ?\nI use Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS\n\nA: I noticed you are using Virtualbox for your tests and unfortunately I can't comment to the success of using that software for testing the Openstack installer. However, you could accomplish this easily with virt-manager and KVM.\nWith that said, the installer uses a combination of KVM/LXC when doing its deployment. If running this within an existing virtual environment you'll want to make sure nested KVM is enabled:\n $ cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested \n\nIf not you can enable with\n $ echo “options kvm-intel nested=1″ | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf\n\nThis is assuming you have Intel/VMX but the same can be accomplished with AMD/SVM (though I've not tested this thoroughly).\nIf you need further assistance please come chat with us at #ubuntu-solutions on irc.freenode.net.\n\nA: VirtualBox does not pass VT-X/AMD-V to the guest operating system, hence KVM cannot work inside VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 + Windows 7, cannot boot into Windows I have spent a day trying every suggestion I can find and using the ArchWiki tutorial. No luck. Here's the situation:\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on /dev/sdb (installed first). I have Windows 7 installed onto /dev/sda (installed 2nd from a USB stick). /dev/sda1 contains the \"SYSTEM_RESERVED\" 100mb partition. /dev/sda2 contains Windows.

Choose \"Windows on /dev/sda\" and you boot into Windows.\n\n*Once in Windows, I installed Easy BCD 2.2, which allowed me to install an EFI boot menu to replace the standard Windows manager. I added \"Ubuntu x64\" from the menu.

Recently I've switched from Windows to Ubuntu. I really love it, but one thing is a real pain: my wifi (Dell Vostro V131 notebook, Centrino Wireless-N 1030) isn't working most of the time with different routers. I've spend many hours to fix this problem, but it still doesn't work.

I've disabled IPv6 and turn off WPA2-security (used a mac-filter instead) and disabled N-mode (Network Issues since Trusty). I've disabled power management and changed many different settings in my router. And I've changed my country code (https://askubuntu.com/a/171398/297583). And I'm sure I forgot 23231 other things I did.\n\n*I've tried many different routers/access points: D-Link DIR-636L, TP-Link TL-WR1043ND, TL-Link TL-WDR3600, ZyXel P-2812HNU-F1 and many others. They all had problems.\n\n*There are many connections that don't have any problems at all. On many other networks, like public hotspots (i.e. in public transport or eduroam at my university) there is no problem.\n\n*When I connect my phone to my notebook with USB (and connect the phone with wifi) it works.\n\n*With an USB dongle (TP-Link TL-WN722N) it works perfectly.\n\n*I haven't got problems in Windows \n\n\nWhat else can I try?\nIf there is no simple solution, maybe it's better to replace the wifi card by another one.

Change the last line to read:\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.

Please see this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1361809 I suggest you install the patched kernel as desribed here: Weak WiFi signal\nIf this does not fix your issue, then I haven't any other suggestions.\n\nA: I have a HP Pavilion DM4 laptop with an intel wireless N 1030 card. A while back, the wifi stopped working. In short, all indications in device manager and elsewhere were normal, it was just that the wifi and bluetooth could not be turned on. I ended up rolling back the bios from F.0C to F.0B, which didn't fix things, but then reinstalled the current F.0C bios software, and everything now works fine. So the hardware was all serviceable, it was just the logic that wasn't telling it to turn on, from what I can see, hope that is of some help.\n", "Q: Install pepper flash player for Chromium on an offline PC?

I am running Ubuntu 14.10\n\nA: I am having the same issue with ru servers.\nThere is a bug on LaunchPad: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bug/1394494\nCurrent workaround is to switch to the main server:\n\n\nA: This is probably just a race condition while the mirror is updated. It's also possible that you're behind a transparent proxy, maybe even without you knowing it.\nAnyway, just wait a couple of hours or overnight, and try again.\nIf the error persists, you can change to another repository (ex. ...us.archive.ubuntu.com...) or remove previously downloaded index files in /var/lib/apt/lists directory.\n\nA: Either you have a problem with your internet or the server is temporarely down. You can try again some other time.\nYou can check if you can reach the server with wget:\nwget http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/\n\n\nA: UPDATE: if anyone else runs into this issue, I fixed mine by replacing the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list with the following:\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid main\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ vivid-updates main\n\n... then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\nA: I tested US servers as some say and it didn't work.

Now it works.\nsudo update-manager\n\nand then select tab Ubuntu Software -> Downloaded from -> other -> Select Best server\nNow it does work\n\n", "Q: Create a script that takes a word as an argument from the user echo \"Enter your string\"  \nread str;\n\nHow can I put in a check to make sure the user passed in a word, displaying\na usage statement if a word was not passed as an argument.\n\nA: [ \"$str\" ] || { echo \"This is my usage statement\"; exit 1; }\n\nThis uses test, denoted by [...]. In its simplest form, as used here, it merely tests if the string is non-empty (returning success/true) or empty (returning fail/false).  The control operator, ||, executes the statement which follows only if the preceding statement returned false.\nI assumed that, if the user failed to enter a non-empty str, that you would want to exit with a failure code after issuing the usage statement.  If not, remove the exit 1.\nIf you have something more complex to do, then use a more formal if statement:\nif [ \"$str\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"This is my usage statement\"\n    # do other stuff....\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nThe above should work on any POSIX shell including dash (/bin/sh) and bash.\nOther Tests\nHere are two related tests (both require bash):\n[ \"${str//[^[:digit:]]/}\" ] || { echo \"You entered no numbers\"; exit 1; }\n\nAnd,\n[ \"${str//[^[:alpha:]]/}\" ] || { echo \"You entered no letters\"; exit 1; }\n\n\nA: In case you'd like to force the user to enter a string, not a numeric value, and keep asking until the input fullfills the requirement, I'd definitely use a test in a while loop, like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true; \ndo\n  echo \"Enter your string\"\n  read str;\n  echo \"${str}\" | grep -q '[0-9]'\n  if [ $? != 0 ] && [ \"$str\" != \"\" ] ; then\n    break\n  else \n    echo 'Invalid input' \n  fi\ndone\n# use the input for further processing\necho $str\n\n(using the test from this post)\n\nA: You could try use string$, and enter in the terminal this:\necho \"enter you name\" ; string$\n   read string$\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Burg theme not working I have successfully installed burg in order to replace that ugly grub since I have a dual boot.

It will prompt you for your MAAS server ip along with the apikey of your MAAS admin user.\nOnce this is set it'll bootstrap juju onto your existing MAAS deployment and provide you with the ability to manually place your Openstack services or automatically apply services to your existing machines with sensible defaults for quickly getting you up and running with Openstack.\n\nA: make sure you don't have any dhcp server on eth0, either by disabling the dhcp, or configuring in an isolated network environment before you pick an interface to deploy maas on with dhcp enabled\n", "Q: How to change the \"Index of ..\" template?

I've set IndexStyleSheet to one specific location so it also will operate from the same file for all local domains.\nIndexStyleSheet \"http://localhost/autoindex.css\"\n\nBut this is just one part of the answer for my question, I also wonder how I should modify the HTML.

It uses Bootswatch templates based on the well known Bootstrap framework.\nIt is fully responsive, with multiple templates and very easy to set up.\nThe source code is available on GitHub so you can fork it and tweak it.\nIt uses Jekyll (GitHub Pages) to generate distribution files.\n\nA: There is a way thanks to Gunnar Hjalmarsson!\nTo change style\nUse the IndexStyleSheet directive. For example:\nIndexStyleSheet \"/css/style.css\"\n\nThe /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/your_site.conf file should looks like:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n        ServerName something.com\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/\n        IndexStyleSheet \"/css/style.css\"\n        ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAnd the /var/www/css/style.css stylesheet:\nbody { color: red; }\n\nResult:\n\n\nAnother more flexible solution..\nPlace an index.html file on the / directory with your own design and list directory functionality :-)\n\nA: I think you want to study the mod_autoindex section in the Apache documentation.\n", "Q: Weird IP cpnnections on default install I install 14.04 in a VM.

The dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.\nSo no, you won't upgrade to 14.10 by using it.\nOTOH, from my experience, most times when packages are kept back like that the reason is that their dependencies are not (yet) available in the repository. So if you wait a few hours, you should be able to upgrade using the ususal apt-get upgrade.\n\nA: Have you try with apt-get install {list of held back packages}, that worked for me several times.\n\"dist-upgrade will install all pending updates, with their new dependencies.

I right clicked on the /dev/sda2 and click resize but it doesn't move. Any ideas? Thanks a lot. \n\nThis post is similar but I don't have a swap in my situation: how to extend main partition with gparted live cd\nIf this doesn't work I'll use SystemRescueCd and try again.\n\nA: It appears that the partition is already at the maximum size.  /dev/sda (entire disk) is 931 GiB, and that is about the same size as the extended partition.\nIf you want to resize just the /boot partition, you would need to decrypt it first, or use some tool from the encryption software.\nEDIT:  \nI believe you have a fairly complicated procedure, but my experience with encrypted partitions is zero.  I avoid procedures such as that, and would much rather encrypt a directory or file, if I needed it, than an entire partition; I think you can see why.\nI think you need to decrypt the partition, then shrink it to make room to enlarge your /boot partition.  Furthermore, you need to copy the entire partition because you need to delete the beginning of the partition in order to shrink it toward the end to make room for /boot, which is at the beginning.  \nThere is information here, but it is complicated by mixing in instructions for both LVM and ext3; I'm not certain what you have.  The links you provided are not applicable, really; your task would be very simple, although time-consuming, if you didn't have the encrypted partition.  But the partitioning programs like gparted see the partition as empty, I believe.\nFor more information, you need to search for \"how to shrink LUKS partition\".\n", "Q: Lost Ubuntu upon re-installing windows 7 After re-installing Windows 7 I can't boot to Ubuntu anymore.\nI keep getting message: \ncan't find `\\Ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\n\nPrior to the re-install there was no problem.\n\nA: If you used the built-in restore function for Windows, it goes back to a \"pristine\" factory original install.

The pulseaudio-module-raop in Ubuntu used to support my 2nd-gen Airport Express, but it no longer appears in my list of pulseaudio sinks.  It's been 6 months since I used it, with a lot changing on my system, including a successful upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04.  Somewhere along the line I assume something got misconfigured or maybe a prefs file deleted.  \nI've enabled \"Make discoverable Airplay AirTunes\" sound devices locally.

Pulse seems to work fine except it doesn't \"see\" my Airplay devices.\nAs an experiment, I built the experimental RAOP2 version of pulse.  It sees my devices and can send audio to them, but it has to be be manually launched and I'd rather be using something from a ppa for updates, etc.  I know it used to work so I want to get it (not the experimental raop2 - I already have that working) going again.\nNot sure where to look next.\n\nA: From the RAOP2 site here's the guide to get RAOP2 working:\nFirst set up your build system.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential paprefs git pulseaudio-module-raop intltool libjack0\nsudo apt-get build-dep pulseaudio\n\nNow get the code and build the software\ngit clone https://github.com/hfujita/pulseaudio-raop2.git\ncd pulseaudio-raop2\n./autogen.sh\nCFLAGS=\"-ggdb3 -O0\" LDFLAGS=\"-ggdb3\" ./configure --prefix=$HOME --enable-x11 --disable-hal-compat\nmake\n\nNow before you can run your new pulseaudio, you need to make some settings and kill the original pulseaudio.\nRun paprefs and check the option to make AirTunes devices available.\nPrevent pulseaudio from starting automatically:\nmkdir ~/.pulse\necho \"autospawn=no\" >> ~/.pulse/client.conf\n\nOn Ubuntu 14.10 and earlier you need to copy over the alsa configuration:\ncp /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/extra-hdmi.conf src/modules/alsa/mixer/profile-sets/\n\nNow to every time you want to use an AirPlay speaker you need to run your new pulseaudio by doing these two things: kill all existing instances of pulseaudio and run the new one (from the pulseaudio-raop2 directory):\npkill pulseaudio\n./src/pulseaudio -n -F src/default.pa -p $(pwd)/src/ --log-time=1 -vvvv 2>&1 | tee pulse.log\n\nThis also creates a log file while running, which should help to identify problems.\nTo stop the RAOP2 version of pulseaudio, press ctrl+c and start the original one with pulseaudio -D\n", "Q: Which image-viewers in linux support the `webp` image format?

I just upgraded to utopic and the indicator for cpufreq-utils just show two cpu frequency options: Power save and Performance.\nBefore in trusty:\n\nNow in utopic:\n\nRegards.\n\nA: If you've got a newer Intel Processor it's because Ubuntu uses a new cpufreq driver called P-State. There are only two governors available for this driver, which are Performance and Powersave.\nThere are no frequencies listed because you can't actually clock the processor to a specific frequency with newer Core processors. Even if you set it to a specific frequency with the old ACPI cpufreq driver the CPU itself it what sets the frequency on this hardware based on voltage and temperature values.\nIf you really want to disable this and go back to ACPI cpufeq (older, slower) you need to edit your GRUB config like in this link, only adding intel_pstate=disable instead of intel_pstate=enable.\nRun\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\nand change the line that says GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_pstate=disable\".\nPress Ctrl + X and then Y to save.\nthen run sudo update-grub and reboot the machine to see the change take effect.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.10 by default uses intel_pstate for frequency control, which has only performance and powersave for governor options.  Should you wish to use the acpi frquency control, you will need to boot with the kernel parameter intel_pstate=disable.\nTo do this, you will need to edit your grub file\nIn a terminal (press ctrl+alt+t):\ncd /etc/default\nsudo cp grub grub.backup\nsudo nano grub\n\nFind the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\nAppend the words intel_pstate=disable to this line, before the final quote\nPress ctrl+o to write the file, and ctrl+x to exit.\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nDespite all of this, I have started using intel_pstate to manage my computer, and find it to perform quite well.\n", "Q: BleachBit reduces space for no reason I ran the bleachbit program and ran the 'Free Disk Space'.

I think the problem may be that you perhaps did not remove the old wine packages / dependencies before attempting to install the new version, or did not run the wine update as an upgrade perhaps?  Also you may want the wine repository as a source.  I can tell you the approach I used:  \nFirst run following command in terminal(Ctrl+Alt+T),\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\nThen update APT package information by running\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudp apt-get check\nsudo-apt-get build-dep wine1.6\n\nmay you can also try sudo apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install wine1.6\n\n", "Q: dpkg returns to error code one I had a proble with dpkg before and I corrected it using this answer.

There is Java class, but I'm not looking for files with .class extension and there is nothing similar to XML. If I select everything on the list, then I get java and XML files but with all other files, which I don't need. How can I specify in photorec that it should look only for .java and .xml files?\n\nA: Both, .java, and .html files are plain text files which will be recovered as such. Because PhotorRec only recovers file content but not file names (or extensions) we can not further narrow the recovery down.\nIt would be possible to add a custom file type to the recoverable files from PhotoRec which then will be given an approptiate extension on recovery but this needs files with a special signature (which usually is not the case for plain text files). Only if your source files had an own unique signature you may be able to do so.\nDepending if your broken drive still allows this you may get better results in recovering files or directories from TestDisk because then filenames will be recovered too.\n", "Q: Can't find MySQL Workbench 6.1 32-bit setup for Ubuntu I am using Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit, but I can't find MySQL Workbench 6.1 32-bit setup for Ubuntu.

ANY IDEAS?\n\nA: Copy the file over to a directory that is in everyone's $PATH. You can check the path with echo $PATH. This should be a default path: \necho $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nMy suggestion would be the bin directory in local. So that would be\n/usr/local/bin/\n\nAvoid general bin directories like /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin and /usr/sbin. Keep those directories clean so you know where your system files and your personal files are.\n\nI would also advice something else: if possible (ie. those users are similar in permissions) you can also add both users to the same group. That way permisssions for one also apply to the other.\n\nA: Move everything from /home/crs/bin to /usr/local/bin.\nBe aware, you need to be root to do that.\n", "Q: Is there a way to increase upload speed in Ubuntu? I don't know why my upload speed is so poor. I use adsl connection, and I measured the speed using cable, not wireless.

I also tried this http://www.ubuntumanual.org/posts/10/how-to-increase-internet-speed-in-ubuntu\nBut I get the message \"command not found\". Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The internet is composed of a chain of computers between you and the host server that contains the file you are downloading. Your upload speed is the slowest of all these links. Some sites are always slow, and some sites just get slow during local peak hours. \nEither find another site that's faster, or just be patient. Also, for many ISPs, the upload speed is much slower than download, as uploads are not done as often as downloads. When you buy an ISP connection, they advertise the faster, download speed, as that is what matters to most people. Call your ISP to see what your actual upload speed should be. \n", "Q: Full screen issue with flash player I have an issue regarding flash player, in some cases it works perfectly fine (Youtube), but when trying to use the full screen feature on Facebook or Twitch.tv it succeeds the first time, however if i Hit ESC to leave the full screen and try to enter it again afterwards, the video will freeze.

When invoked by pdcp, it is not\n  possible for ssh to prompt for confirmation if a host key  changes, \n  prompt  for passwords  if RSA keys are not configured properly, etc..\n\nA solution would be to connect to all hosts in all_hosts once before and to accept their host keys or to disable (!)

You can use the PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND environment variable to pass these options to the underlying process.\nPDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND=\"-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\" pdcp -R ssh -w ^all_hosts hadoop-2.5.1.tar.gz /opt\n\nThis environment variable works for straight pdsh as well.\n", "Q: Sopcast on Ubunutu no sound and vlc problem I installed sopcast on ubunutu.

I thought it was running fine but in Additional Drivers it was I'm using the proprietary driver but none is selected in the list. Trying to run steam gives me the error: \"OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display\". I have nvidia-config but not nvidia-settings. Nvidia x server icon is in settings but if I click it it says something like \"you have to close X then run sudo nvidia-xconfig to install this\" which I do with sudo system lightdm stop, but it doesn't change anything. glxinfo gives me the same 'everything missing' output as this guy. I then tried sudo apt-get install nvidia-current which looks like it went fine... but now I can't boot into xubuntu - it gets to the point where you'd expect the splashscreen and just sits at a blinking cursor.\nVery frustrated. Thought after all the ballache of getting the 340.46 driver installed it was all working but evidently not. Now I can't get into my primary boot, but have my SATA drive 14.04 xubuntu, my primary is my new SSD 14.10 xubuntu. I can't see my SSD from my SATA, it seems, so I don't know how I'd go about (e.g.) deleting xorg.conf or whatever might need to be done. Nightmare. Why is video driver install this complicated?\nDoes anyone know how I can dig myself out of this hole? Thanks!\np.s. as a generality I assume it's best if I can get the latest nvidia driver working for my card since it'll support the most.. stuff? But does that tend to result in a whirlwind of bugs and thus would I be better doing something else? Cheers.\nEdit1: Looks like I should boot into failsafe and restore a safe xorg.conf file? Looking on my 14.04 install, I don't seem to have an xorg.conf file, in /etc/x11 or /usr/x11 or /usr/lib. This might be because I believe I'm running a successful nvidia driver install on this OS?\nEdit2: xorg.conf is absent in my secondary OS (which doesn't matter cos it works anyway) but present in the right place in my primary so I booted into root/terminal as per the comment on here then moved/renamed my xorg.conf to see if any of the 3 backups, or no xorg.conf, meant I could boot. They didn't. Logging into my secondary, for some reason the permissions have changed for sudo so not only can I not restart or shutdown, but none of the core features work e.g. gparted. Given that I'd since found that changing xorg.conf on the primary didn't help I guess this was moot but changing the permissions of /usr/bin/sudo, usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so, /etc/sudoers, /etc/sudoers.d one by one from the secondary OS's recovery root/terminal, only half allowed things to work (would have needed to do the same for /etc/sudoers.d/README and /var/lib/sudo). Gparted could then see the SSD but by then like I say, I've already worked out how to edit stuff in the primary from the recovery root/terminal.\nMy final, possibly key, startup error message is \"init: Error while reading from descriptor: Broken pipe\", launchpad bug here. Notwithstanding that my secondary OS permissions are all over the place and massively corrupted, surely there must be a way to 'start from fresh' with the display driver which is assumedly causing all this woe?\nEdit3: Tried purging & reinstalling xserver-xorg as per this and then this post, no change. Will look further at the broken pipe error which continues to be displayed after doing the xserver stuff.\nEdit4: tried jmiserez's comment on Oli's answer from here, which didn't work. Oli's answer revealed I have nvidia-304, nvidia-331-updates, xserver-xorg-video-nouveau, nvidia-304-updates and nvidia-331 drivers; nvidia-current is already the latest version.\nEdit5: trying this solution failed because I don't seem to have networking enabled from the recovery terminal. If I hit \"enable networking\" from the recovery mode options it lists all the drives, saying clean, then recovering journal, then stops at a blinking cursor and doesn't accept any input. Wonderful.\nEdit 6: fixed networking per this. Retried above solution, sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates fails with unmet dependencies of nvidia-304-updates. Trying to install that fails with unmet dependencies libcuda1-304-updates, nvidia-opencl-icd-304-updates, and conflicts with xorg-driver-binary. Bashing head against this for a few days now. Best option possibly to purge all nvidia drivers and revert to a clean xorg/nouveau, but I don't know how to do that. Will search around I guess.\nEdit7: trying to purge nvidia drivers with this solution fails because python-qgis-common (mapping software) depends libqgis-customwidgets2.7.0 but it is not installed. Tried to install it & that failed: errors were encountered when processing the deb, /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1). Honestly don't see why linux cares that one package dependency is unmet when trying to fix something completely unrelated. Since I have the nouveau driver I'll try force loading that and leave the nvidia drivers alone.\nEdit 8: sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf and echo 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules did something at least - I saw the ubuntu 14.10 megabasic 4 dots splash screen then a page of text before the blank screen. It's a list of services getting started, last item is \"GNUstep distributed object mapper disabled, see /etc/default/gdomap\nsaned disabled; edit /etc/default/saned\". So I guess that's the next lead to follow...\nEdit 9: possibly I can access a terminal once I'm at the blank screen section. But I rebooted and it didn't get there again. Rebooted back into recovery terminal and checked xorg.conf was still absent & the nouveau line was still in modules, both true, so not aware of what's changed. Great.\nEdit 10: changed nothing and it booted to black this time; didn't get the saned line but did get the GNUstep one. Crtl+Alt+F1/2/3 do nothing. I don't have an F4 key, it broke off. Same problem for this guy, never got an answer, and it looks like he also posted here, where other people have tried the same suggestion I tried and it also bricked their system. Sounds like GDOmap night even be a red herring since it apparently can be turned off...maybe it's not causing a problem it just has an error which doesn't matter, then the boot sequence carries on past it to the display driver & startx and then it goes black. Dead end here, circling back to previous clues, looks like i'll have to debug my mapping program in the terminal. Joy.\nTLDR: installing nvidia-current means xubuntu won't boot - stops at blinking text entry bar - possibly implicating broken pipe error. (if this IS the problem) How can I reset my display settings?\n\nA: Manually installing those drivers from package is considered a very bad thing by communities of any repository. And for good reason. Never do it without a good reason. \nIf I remember right, you could run this driver installer with --uninstall key to remove the driver (mostly). Then, see if it created a file /etc/X11/xorg/conf and remove it, then in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d remove the file created by this installer but do not remove anything else. Then \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current\n\nShould work. \n\nA: I had the same issue /with Ubuntu 14.04/,\nTried everything with nvidia drivers tough...\nNOTHING only black screen\nthen\nI changed the newest kernel, downloaded and manually installed\nthe 3.16 fro here\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/08/install-upgrade-linux-kernel-3-16/\nAfter reboot nvidia latest, tested driver 331.38 working\nMay it helps on xubuntu to change the kernel.\nHave fun..\n", "Q: No \"startup applications\" menu in Ubuntu 14.10?

Shouldn't there be an instance of Wine?\n\nA: That is the normal behaviour for about as long as I have used Wine (~4 years). Wine does not do anything by itself, it is always used for running something else:\n$ wine\nUsage: wine PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]   Run the specified program\n       wine --help                   Display this help and exit\n       wine --version                Output version information and exit\n\nPrograms installed in Wine usually get their own launchers.\n", "Q: Directory using more space than expected I have a directory on Ubuntu that contains 262144 files.  Each file is a 25x25 png image.  On average these files are approximately 1.14kb and no file is larger than 2kb.  Yet this directory is using up 3.1GB of disk space.  How is this possible?  By my calculations this directory should be using 262144 * 1140 = 298844160 bytes, which is only 0.298844 GB.  \nHere are the steps I followed to get this information.\nI ran ls -1 -f | wc -l to count the number of files in the directory.  This returns 262146 (i.e., 262144 + 1 + 1 for . and ..).\nNext I ran find . -size +2k and the result was just ..  \nFinally I ran du -sh culprit_directory and the result shows 3.1G culprit_directory.\nThere are two things that I imagine could be happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu needs extra space to store a directory that contains a very large number of very small files.  Possible, but a whole order of magnitude?\n\n*I am making a mistake in my calculations and this is the expected size for the directory.  Also possible, but I am unable to see where I made this mistake.\n\n\nIf anyone with more experience with Ubuntu's internal file storage could advise me I would greatly appreciate it.\nEDIT:\nI have added one of the png files.  This one is 591 bytes in size.\n\nEDIT:\nThanks to muru's helpful comments below, I have determined that each file is actually using 12KB on disk, even if it only consists of a few hundred bytes.  Using the new numbers, we get 262144 * 12000 = 3145728000, which gives us 3.145728GB.\nI guess my new question would be how to avoid each file using so much space?\n\nA: Answering the follow-up question, probably the easiest thing to do in these cases is to create a small ad-hoc filesystem and loop-mount it. Something like this:\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=imgdisk.img bs=1M count=512\n512+0 records in\n512+0 records out\n536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 0.425628 s, 1.3 GB/s\n$ du -h imgdisk.img \n513M    imgdisk.img\n$ mkfs.ext4 -b 2048 imgdisk.img \nmke2fs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)\nDiscarding device blocks: done                            \nCreating filesystem with 262144 2k blocks and 32768 inodes\nFilesystem UUID: 8837a733-6b75-4326-bb72-9372538653ad\nSuperblock backups stored on blocks: \n        16384, 49152, 81920, 114688, 147456\n\nAllocating group tables: done                            \nWriting inode tables: done                            \nCreating journal (8192 blocks): done\nWriting superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done \n\n$ mkdir imgmount\n$ sudo mount imgdisk.img imgmount -o loop\n$ ls imgmount/\nlost+found\n\ncopy the images in there (sized as it is it might be just too small for your files; make the 512 a 513 if so), umount the loop filesystem, mount it over the directory with all the images. If that works, umount it from there, delete the original images, edit /etc/fstab so it mounts the loopback filesystem in the right place, mount -a and you're set.\nEdit: you can use -b 1024 instead of 2048, also.\n\nA: Different pieces of software report different disk space usage statistics in 2 ways. Files can have a size that is the number of bytes in a file, and a \"physical size\" which is the sum of the cluster sizes used by that file. The physical size, or \"cluster size\" is the minimum chunk the OS keeps track of when referring to space used on a disk.  So if you have one file containing 1 byte, and your cluster size is 8 kilobytes, the file uses a minimum of 1 cluster, or 8kb. \nWasted disk space really isn't normally a problem, even as disk sizes increase and clusters sizes increase to 32kb or 64kb. \n guess my new question would be how to avoid each file using so much space?\n\nPut files that are used less into an archive file, like a .zip file. \nThe OS has a limit on how many clusters it can keep track of. \nMaybe someone else can explain the limit on cluster sizes for several OSs. \n", "Q: Launcher icon doesn't start MySQL workbench I recently upgraded from 14.04 to 14.10 and faced an issue with running queries on MySQL workbench but this answer on SOF solved it.

How to install or compile avconv with libfdk_aac on Ubuntu 14.04 ? I am also ok with comparable aac codecs e.g. http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Fraunhofer_FDK_AAC\nCurrently I am trying this but with avconv: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu\nI let you know how it works out.\n\nA: Or if you want to use the inferiour aac:\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools\n\nThen instead of using the Fraunhofer use these switches:\n-acodec aac -strict experimental or -acodec libvo_aacenc\n\nAudio quality may vary.\n\nA: Here's how I do it. But I must warn you, this requires a little courage as you must build libav (This will give you the avconv executable among other tools) yourself. But have no fear, I have done it many times and I'll show you how to to build and install everything without messing your system up. If you don't want your custom libav build anymore, all you have to do is delete a directory.\nPrerequisites\nFirst I remove the avconv installed buy default with:\napt-get remove --purge libav-tools\n\nThen make sure you have the required tools for building software in general:\napt-get install build-essential\n\nTo get the fastest avconv possible you'll need an assembly compiler. That's easy:\napt-get install yasm\n\nNow get into a scrap directory to build in, I'll do:\nmkdir ~/src\ncd ~/src\n\nNow clone the libav git repo (you'll need git installed for this):\ngit clone git://git.libav.org/libav.git\n\nThis will give you the the latest and greatest libav source, I have found the bleeding edge code stable enough for my needs and haven't run into any code related bugs during building.\nLet the repo clone and then install libfdk-aac through the package manager:\napt-get install libfdk-aac-dev\n\nTo make things simple lets just install the libx264 library for avconv to use:\napt-get install libx264-dev\n\nCreate a home for the binaries and other files that will be built in a moment\n(This will make things easy to uninstall as well):\nmkdir ~/apps    \n\nOnce installed, the avconv executable will be located in ~/apps/bin/\nTo run avconv from the command line simply add ~/apps/bin to you $PATH\nInstallation\nNow you, need to configure the libav source to use your newly install fdk-aac library.\nSimply enter this in the command line:\n./configure \\\n--prefix=~/apps \\\n--enable-nonfree \\\n--enable-gpl \\\n--disable-shared \\\n--enable-static \\\n--enable-libx264 \\\n--enable-libfdk-aac\n\nThis command will give you all of libav default encoding and decoding libraries plus\nlibx264 and libfdk_aac\nNote: should you want more encoding functionality try ./configure --help to see all the external libraries you can enable.\nNow all thats left to do is build the thing!\nThis should only take a few minutes on a decent machine.\nmake && make install\n\nIf you added ~/apps/bin to you $PATH you should be able to run 'avconv' now. \nTo update your custom libav build, just run:\ngit pull origin\n\nIn ~/src/libav/ up pull the latest code. Then reconifgure with the command above, make and make install.\nShould you every want to get rid of you custom build and reinstall ubuntu's default libav-tools packages run:\nrm -rf ~/apps/\napt-get install libav-tools\n\nAnd remove ~/apps/bin from your $PATH\nSorry if the task you want to achieve seems daunting, but it makes me proud to use a custom built, bleeding edge version of avconv :) I think the extra work pays off. Hope this helps :)\nVerification\nVerify it is installed correctly with:\navconv -codecs | grep aac\n\nYou want to see:\nAAC (Advanced Audio Coding) (decoders: aac libfdk_aac ) (encoders: aac libfdk_aac )\n\nUsage\navconv -f alsa -i default -c:a libfdk_aac -b:a 256k filename.aac\n\nPlease note that the infamous experimental flag is now not necessary nor recommended anymore. \nYou want to see:\n  Metadata:\n  encoder         : Lavc58.12.1 libfdk_aac\n\n", "Q: How to install Moto drivers for ADB As stated above, I want to install moto drivers on my laptop thats running ubuntu 14.04.

(It also keeps it from reading any more lines after finding a match, but that doesn't make a difference here as there is only one line of input.)\nIt's tempting to shorten the if construct to something like grep -q @ <<<\"$REPLY\" && echo pass || echo fail, but I have deliberately avoided doing so:\n\n\n*\n\n*In this case, that's probably okay, since the only way the wrong word prints is if pass was supposed to be printed and echo failed to print it. Then, presumably, echo would fail to print fail as well.\n\n*While short-circuit && and || are often themselves appropriate (and I frequently use them to abbreviate an if without an else clause), using them together as though they were a ternary if operator is not really a good habit. While some commands cannot fail, echo can.\n\n*If the user redirects your script's output to an unwritable file or device, or uses it in a broken pipeline, echo and other commands that output text can return failure, causing the && expression to fail and the right side of the || expression to execute.\n\n*You can test the behavior of a script in the presence of an unwritable output device by running it with >/dev/full.\n\n\nThat script uses a few bash features:\n\n\n*\n\n*-e enables GNU readline, so the user can move the cursor left and right with the arrow keys to edit their input while entering it.\n\n*In bash, read automatically puts the user's input in the REPLY variable if no variable was given.\n\n*A here string with <<< is a convenient way to pass the user's input to grep.\n\n*Bash and some other Bourne-style shells such as dash accept -p. But POSIX-compatible shells need only understand -r. And in some, like ksh, -p has a different meaning.\n(Thanks to geirha for pointing out both that -p is sometimes absent and that it doesn't always mean \"prompt.\")\n\n\nIf you want a script that's portable to on other OSes that might not have bash installed, you can use:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nprintf '> '\nread -r line\n\nif printf '%s' \"$line\" | grep -q @; then\n    echo pass\nelse\n    echo fail\nfi\n\nIf you like, you can skip storing the user's input in a variable by reading it with head instead of read:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nprintf '> '\nif head -1 | grep -q @; then\n    echo pass\nelse\n    echo fail\nfi\n\nAs geirha mentioned, head -n 1 might be considered better syntax as head -1 is officially obsolete (though current sed implementations, or at least GNU sed, support -1 in their latest versions, while some very old sed implementations do not support -n 1).\nAs the head documentation says, you can use sed instead for maximum portability.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nprintf '> '\nif sed 1q | grep -q @; then\n    echo pass\nelse\n    echo fail\nfi\n\n\nA: This bash code reads input and signals \"Pass\" if the input contains an @ symbol:\nread -p \"Input: \" var\n[ \"${var//[^@]/}\" ] && echo Pass || echo Fail\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*[ \"$var\" ] is a bash test.  It returns true if the string $var is non-empty.  \n\n*One of bash's features is pattern substitution.  It looks like ${var//pattern/string}.  It replaces every occurrence of pattern in var with string.  In our case, pattern is [^@] which is a regular expression which matches every character except @.  Thus ${var//[^@]/} returns an empty string unless var contains at least one @.\n\n*We combine the above two:\n[ \"${var//[^@]/}\" ]\n\nThis test succeeds only if ${var//[^@]/} is non-empty and ${var//[^@]/} is non-empty only if var contains at least one @.\nUsing an explicit if-then-else:\nread -p \"Input: \" var\nif [ \"${var//[^@]/}\" ]\nthen\n    echo Pass\nelse\n    echo Fail\nfi\n\nPOSIX Shell\nThe following works under dash (/bin/sh) and should work under any POSIX shell:\nprintf \"Input: \"\nread var\ncase \"$var\" in\n    *@*) echo Pass\n        ;;\n    *) echo Fail\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThe POSIX shell does not support the -p option to read.  So, a combination of printf and read are used instead.  Also, lacking advanced variable expansion features of bash, the case statement can be used for glob matching.\nAndroid Shell\nUsing the default shell on my android, the following works:\necho -n \"Input: \"; read var\nif ! [ \"${var//@/}\" = \"$var\" ]\nthen\n    echo Pass\nelse\n    echo Fail\n\n\nA: The preferred way in bash is to use the pattern matching feature of [[ ... ]].\n#bash\nread -rp \"Input: \" input\nif [[ $input = *@* ]]; then\n    printf '<%s> contains @\\n' \"$input\"\nfi\n\nFor sh scripts you can use case instead.\n#sh\nprintf 'Input: '\nread -r input\ncase $input in\n    *@*) printf '<%s> contains @\\n' \"$input\" ;;\nesac\n\nSee also the Tests and Conditionals chapter of the Bash Guide.\n\nA: In newer versions of bash, you should be able to use a regular expression match via the =~ extended test operator:\n$ read -p \"input: \" input\ninput: quertyuiop \n$ if [[ $input =~ \\@ ]]; then echo \"match\"; else echo \"no match\"; fi\nno match\n$ \n$ read -p \"input: \" input\ninput: qwerty@uiop\n$ if [[ $input =~ \\@ ]]; then echo \"match\"; else echo \"no match\"; fi\nmatch\n\nAn alternative that should work in any POSIX compliant system is to use expr e.g. in the dash shell:\n$ read input\nqwertyuiop\n$ if expr \"$input\" : '.*@.*' > /dev/null; then echo 'match'; else echo 'no match'; fi\nno match\n$ \n$ read input\nqwerty@uiop\n$ if expr \"$input\" : '.*@.*' > /dev/null; then echo 'match'; else echo 'no match'; fi\nmatch\n$ \n\n", "Q: Failed update 14.04 server version 3.13.0-39 I tried to upgrade my 14.04 server using dist-upgrade.

If you have not installed a dedicated graphics card from NVIDIA,you cannot use the NVIDIA driver!  The 2 drivers that you have installed will fight each other. In other words, you have to remove the NVIDIA driver completly using one of these commands in a terminal [sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current] or [sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current-updates] or [sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*] depending on what kind of machine you are using, laptop, desktop,ect., you can copy and paste these commands into a terminal, BUT do not copy the symbol [ or ] in the command line I only used them for seperation. After removing everything to do with NVIDIA, shut down and reboot system. when you restart, your system will be operating using only the INTEL driver:-) If you do have a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card installed, the above commands should still be used, so that you can do a fresh install of NVIDIA driver through (software & updates--additional drivers box) , the UBUNTU recomended driver is not always the driver that will work best, case in point, I am using UBUNTU 14.10 and UBUNTU 15.04 and the driver they recomend is version 340.46, but I have to use version 331.104 for everything to work correctly :-)  If at any time you change driver being used, you need to follow above commands and purge all remains of previous driver, and then install your new driver, once new driver is installed, shutdown and restart. Most but not all systems disables intel driver automaticly when a dedicated graphics card is installed so you might check your BIOS at startup and make sure it is disabled if you are running a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card.

I stepped away from Linux for quite a few years because time did not permit me to learn two systems. I recently became disabled and now have nothing but time. I decided to try Linux again as I heard it had come a long way with accessibility. I am blind but thought I would try it out. I have been able to get most things up and running fairly well.\nThis is where I am having problems. I installed Ubuntu-gnome as I have found gnome to be more accessible than Unity. It is installed on my laptop in an encrypted volume. My problems are from the login. With some sited assistance I have figured out how to get to the login screen, but have problems logging in. From what I am told, it appears to be a command line login. I installed speakup to try to access it but could not get it to work. It will start speaking but just reads off a few lines and stops. It says something about trying to connect to pulse audio and then tries to connect to a few other similar things before it stops speaking. I think it is just because speakup needs to be configured, but I can not figure out how to do that.\nI guess the heart of my question is this:\nA. What would be the easiest way to setup an accessible login to Ubuntu-GNOME?\nB. If it is speakup, how do I set that up?\nAny help with this would be appreciated.\n\nA: OK. After a few days of research I found the answer. I enabled the screen reader for the install from the live DVD. It did not, however, enable all the accessibility features like a normal ubuntu install does. It was starting GDM but just wasn't talking to me.

I want to install Ubuntu, but keep my Windows 7 partition.\nDo you have any ideas?\nYou can look at my screenshot:\n\n\nA: I know a very simple and time saving trick for this. You will need a small amazing os called puppy linux for this operation. It's a small os about 200mb designed to run from cd's only. With this method you'll save several minutes and alot of energy. First install the Ubuntu using the something else method. After that, you're pc will boot straight into ubuntu without detecting windows at all. The remove the Ubuntu bootable cd and put in the precise puppy cd. When puppy boots, go to the menu and look for grub dos or something like that name. I don't remember the exact name but usually there's two grub one with dos name and the other with legacy name, so choose the one with dos. Use the grub software to set up a dual boot menu. It automatically detects all the operating systems that you have in your hard drives, takes a few seconds or minutes to do that and after installing the dual boot, you can customize it by editing the menu via the text. Just copy paste the text of the oses where you want each to arrange. For example if you want the windows to be the first one, when you start grub installer select single menu list and then after it open the menu text, just copy the text for windows and paste it at the first line before the other os. This is a very simple process. I hope you understand my english. I'm not good english dude.\n", "Q: lxc-create hangs and finally fails I was trying to place some juju charms on linux containers and the containers failed to start.

If too much dust assembles over time, the internal fans aren't able to keep enough cool air streaming through the computer case to keep the hardware temperature at acceptable levels. This can cause performance throttling (to decrease power consumption and heat exhaustion) or (most often temporary) random hardware failures that result in system freezes or crashes.\nSolution\nTry to clean out the dust from your computer.\n", "Q: Printing footers using enscript I have a working bash script which converts text files to postscript using enscript 1.6.5.90-2 on Kubuntu 14.04.\nIt does several other things to make the output look better like setting margins, wrapping lines, etc. (which is why I need enscript instead of other simpler printing tools.)\nThe script currently prints a title in the page header, but now I need a footer too.\nCan anybody show me a current working example using enscript to produce footer lines?\nI see --footer=FOOTER in the man page, but I also see that the default footer height is zero points. I have tried a number of ways to get footers to print. None of them produce any error messages, but they don't print footers either.\nI don't have room for everything I want to see in the header alone so I need to put some of it in the footer.\n\nA: I believe that, if you want footers, you have to write a custom hdr file and then select it with the --fancy-header option.  I have written one (below) that may work for you.\nThere is a nine-year-old bug report on this problem.  The approach in that bug report attempts a more comprehensive solution and requires re-compiling enscript.  My approach is not as comprehensive but eliminates the need for a re-compile.\nThis header file is based on simple.hdr.  To use it, copy and paste it into a file called, say, simple2.hdr, and, for system-wide use, place it in the directory /usr/share/enscript.  For personal use, it can be placed in the ~/.enscript/ directory:\n% -- code follows this line --\n%Format: fmodstr    $D{%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y}\n%Format: pagenumstr $V$%\n\n%HeaderHeight: 38\n%FooterHeight: 15\n\n/do_header {   % print default simple header\n\n  % Footer\n  gsave\n    d_footer_x d_footer_y HFpt_h 3 div add translate\n    HF setfont\n\n    user_footer_p {\n      d_footer_x  d_footer_y moveto user_footer_left_str show\n\n      d_footer_w user_footer_center_str stringwidth pop sub 2 div\n      0 moveto user_footer_center_str show\n\n      d_footer_x d_footer_w add user_footer_right_str stringwidth pop sub\n      d_footer_y moveto user_footer_right_str show\n    } if\n  grestore\n\n  % Header\n  gsave\n    d_header_x d_header_y HFpt_h 3 div add translate\n    HF setfont\n\n    user_header_p {\n      5 0 moveto user_header_left_str show\n\n      d_header_w user_header_center_str stringwidth pop sub 2 div\n      0 moveto user_header_center_str show\n\n      d_header_w user_header_right_str stringwidth pop sub 5 sub\n      0 moveto user_header_right_str show\n    } {\n      5 0 moveto fname show\n      45 0 rmoveto fmodstr show\n      45 0 rmoveto pagenumstr show\n    } ifelse\n  grestore\n\n} def\n\nUsage is quite simple.  You can then invoke it with something like:\nenscript --fancy-header=simple2 --header=\"HEADER\" --footer=\"LEFT|CTR|RIGHT\"\n\nNote that, although enscript supports many character sets, it does not support UTF-8.  Files that are not in a natively supported character set can be filtered through iconv first before passing them to enscript.\n", "Q: How can I choose Ubuntu on my window 8.1 dual boot computer I installed successfully Ubuntu 14.10 on my window 8.1 as dual boot but I can't choose which OS will boot at the startup.

Step 3, Shut down and restart system normally and you should have a GRUB screen appear that will be showing all your different operating systems, using arrow keys, move to OS that you would like to use and hit ENTER, it will take you to the OS that you have picked. Be AWARE that you have only about 15 to 20 seconds to chose or it will automaticly take you to the first OS from the top, if this happens just restart and choose again. I can't for the life of me tell you how many times I have gotten sidetracked and had to restart:-(, because I was not paying attention:-)(-: Until you get used to it I would recommend as soon as the screen appears click your down arrow key one time and it will put the GRUB screen on hold and let you get a chance to see the different things you have to chose from.

My PC have 4 GB of ram and 2.23 GHz dual core processor... after installing Ubuntu its running slow.. should I switch to 32 bit or are there any other options?\n\nA: You probably don't have 3D acceleration, which Ubuntu needs. If 3D acceleration is not found, Ubuntu uses the CPU instead of the GPU to let appear some image on your screen. That's very CPU-intensive, so that's probably why your computer is so slow.\nAlso, the hardware architecture (64 bit vs 32 bit) won't matter.\nYou can try installing the proprietairy driver.

All pings to the FQDN time out.\nAt a minimum, for the initial step, how do I make pc1, the computer with the FQDN for its hostname, accessible so that it at least responds to pings? \nI'm only interested in using Glassfish, but could install Apache2 webserver, or Tomcat, if required for troubleshooting.\nsee also:\nhttps://java.net/projects/glassfish/lists/users/archive/2014-11/message/2\n\nA: So, First of all, this has nothing to do with glassfish. If you can browse to the ip address, glassfish is working fine. This is a purely DNS problem.\nWhy doesn't it work?\nYour router is using NAT. This means that if PC1 wants to connect to askubuntu.com, it uses the router public IP and a random port: IP_ADDRESS:PORT. Askubuntu.com thinks that your router is requesting a webpage from IP_ADDRESS:PORT. Askubuntu.com sends the webpage to your router(IP_ADDRESS:PORT). Your router then forwards this to your PC1. Your router knows it has to forward it to your PC1 and not PC2, because your PC1 started the connection. PC1 requested the webpage.\nIn the case of your server, you want people on the internet to connect to your server. So the connection will not start from PC1 but from the internet. The FQDN points to your router. Your router will get a request for a webpage on IP_ADDRESS:80. Because the connection was started from the internet and not from PC1, the router does not know it has to forward the traffic to PC1. Your router will drop the traffic.\nWhat can you do to fix it?\nYou have to configure a static port forward on your router, so your router knows that he has to forward all the traffic he receives on PUBLIC_IP:80 to PC1_PRIVATE_IP:80.\nHow you can configure port forwarding on a specific router is described here: http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/\nEven after you configure this port forward, you will not be able to ping the FQDN of PC1, because ping uses another port. HTTP (browsing) uses port 80, PING uses port 1.\n", "Q: why is piping pgrep output into kill is not working I am playing around with pipes to learn how to use them.\nI am trying this command to kill a process by name: pgrep <some_process> | kill \nbut the output I am getting is the usage instruction for kill, like it didn't receive any input.  \nof course I know there are easier way to accomplish the same task like pkill or killall, but I want to know why is this not working.\nThank you\n\nA: kill is not reading anything from stdin but expects some command line args and throws an error if it doesn't get them.\nPiping only works if the program on the right side of the pipe is actually reading from the pipe. Not all programs do.\n\nA: As Florian explained, kill expects command line inputs. \nTo go around the problem you can use \n\n\n*\n\n*xargs to build command line arguments for a command, e.g., pgrep vivaldi | xargs kill or better yet pgrep vivaldi | awk 'BEGIN{ORS=\" \"} 1' | xargs kill\n\n*shell's substitution:  kill $(pgrep vivaldi)\n\n*killall which does pretty much the same job as pgrep and kill combined , e.g., killall vivaldi\n\n*pkill , another utility to kill based on name, e.g., pkill vivaldi\n\nA: For killing a program by its name, if you actually know the process' name, you could just use the command skill <your process name>;\nNow for pipes, a good way to understand them is playing around with tools like echo, more, less, tail, head, etc. There are many programs that can actually read from a pipe... one I have always used is grep.\n", "Q: How To Transfer Files Between Two Ubuntu Machines Connected Via RJ45?

Two 64GB exfat SD-Cards did not trigger the usual pop-up from the device notifier when inserted into the card reader.\nThe card reader did work before the upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10 with exactly the same cards.\nI put one of the cards back into the camera where I originally did use them. It was mounted and all photos where still present.\nSo, the card still works too.\nThen I connected the camera via USB and failed too, with an error message I didn't spend any time at all investigating.\nI popped the card back into the card reader and looked at dmesg.

I am trying to convert some aac files to flac files, because aac is not supported by another device I use.\nAfter some multiple attempts to find a solution, searching the Internet, I finally read that ffmpeg was replaced with avconv and that avconv is a fork of ffmpeg. So I searched for how to convert to flac using avconv and found this line:\navconv -i (input file) -f flac (output file path)\n\nThis works well, however, I don't see any flac compression level in that command and I need to have a compression level of 2 or lower, because of cpu resources on the target device. I checked the man-page for avconv, but it doesn't seem to mention flac compression levels at all.\nSo my question is: How do I specify the flac compression level when converting from any input format to flac using avconv?\n\nA: There is a -compression_level attribute. Man page gives its format as\n-compression_level[:stream_specifier] integer (output,audio,video)\n\nYou will likely not need to specify the stream, since you have only a single one in the file, so -compression_level 2 is your friend.\nIn the future you may want to check man page for the tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal.\n\n*Type man (name of program). For example man avconv.\n\n*To search the manual, press '/' and enter the string to search for. In this case i've done '/compression', this was the second thing that was found.\n\n\nA: The option is -compression_level and can be set with either avconv or FFmpeg:\nffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n\nInterestingly enough the commandline flac encoder offers compression levels of 0-8 but FFmpeg / avconv offers 0-12. The documentation can be seen in 3 places:\n1. Source code:\nThe options for flac compression can be seen in flacenc.c:\n/* set compression option defaults based on avctx->compression_level */\nif (avctx->compression_level < 0)         <-------------\n    s->options.compression_level = 5;     <-------------\nelse\n    s->options.compression_level = avctx->compression_level;\n\nlevel = s->options.compression_level;\nif (level > 12) {                         <-------------\n    av_log(avctx, AV_LOG_ERROR, \"invalid compression level: %d\\n\",\n           s->options.compression_level);\n    return AVERROR(EINVAL);\n}\n\nI have 'arrowed' in the relevant sections!\n2. Man pages:\nThe compression options can also be seen in man ffmpeg-all rather than man ffmpeg :). This man page shows:\ncompression_level\nSets the compression level, which chooses defaults for many other options\nif they are not set explicitly. Valid values are from 0 to 12, 5 is the default.\n\nA little confusing with multiple man pages now available for FFmpeg!\n3. Online documentation:\nAs 'Miso Soup' pointed out there is also some documentation available online for the deeper options of flac encoding, including the compression options:\ncompression_level\nSets the compression level, which chooses defaults for many\nother options if they are not set explicitly. Valid values\nare from 0 to 12, 5 is the default.\n\nSame as the man pages but perhaps a little easier for some to find and read!\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg git: flacenc.c\n\n*FFmpeg codecs documentation: flac\n", "Q: Getting \"Ambiguous input redirect.\" when using diff I'm relatively new to linux so be tender.\ndiff shiftingV1.0 < inputTest.in shiftingV1.2 < inputTest.in\n\nBasically I want to check if there's any difference between the output of those two (written in C) for a given input, I can write the output of each code to a txt and then compare but I think this is a better solution, but it's not really working.\nThanks.\n\nA: If shiftingV1.0 and shiftingV1.2 are commands that produce their output on the standard output stream, then you can use bash's process substitution feature, e.g.\ndiff <(command1) <(command2)\n\nor in your case, assuming your commands read from the file inputTest.in via standard input\ndiff <(shiftingV1.0 < inputTest.in) <(shiftingV1.2 < inputTest.in)\n\n", "Q: Graphical Diff viewer that supports LXDE (Lubuntu) I've installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu on my netbook for the purpose of development \"on-the-go\".

The following five topics are useful things to know about how to solve a blank screen problem that occurred after installing the AMD graphics driver in Ubuntu 14.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*To bring up a text-only console use the keyboard combination Ctrl+Alt+F3 and then you will get a text-only console which shows you a login prompt. Two other useful things to know about the console are: the keyboard combination Ctrl+Alt+F7 to move away from the console and the command sudo reboot to reboot the computer.\n\n*To uninstall the proprietary graphics driver (if it was downloaded from the official AMD website) from a text-only console, login and run the command: sudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh and reboot the computer. Removing Catalyst/fglrx says if fglrx-uninstall.sh doesn't exist use: sudo apt-get purge fglrx* and reboot to uninstall the graphics driver from the AMD website manually. The same command sudo apt-get purge fglrx* is also used to uninstall the proprietary AMD graphics driver if it was installed from the Ubuntu repositories.\n\n*To start the Additional Drivers utility from the desktop environment search for Additional Drivers in the Dash and click the Additional Drivers icon.\n\n*There is also a text-only terminal program to show the available graphics driver packages. From the terminal or from the console run: ubuntu-drivers devices. This command will often also identify the recommended proprietary graphics driver for your system. Wait for at least a minute after entering the command for the operating system to scan your hardware.\n\n*AMD Catalyst Drivers 14.9 needs kernel-headers on 14.10, although it is missing a version for Utopic. This is another reason to choose a proprietary graphics driver from the Ubuntu repositories instead of downloading it from the official AMD website.\nHopefully some of these tips will help you to get this issue sorted out. In Ubuntu everything you need to do to install, uninstall or get information about a graphics driver can be done from a terminal or from a text-only console, so if you make a mistake you can fix it, even if you can't login to your graphical desktop environment.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK. error: \"Kit autocreation for error is not supported\" I am using ubuntu sdk, and I am trying to create Kit for my device.

This actually has to do with differences in disk partitioning between the two modes -- MBR vs GPT partitioning. Ubuntu is booted in EFI mode and so it looks for a GPT table and GPT partitions which don't exist due to Windows using the MBR partitioning scheme.\n\n*To be able to see Windows, change the boot priority to Legacy/BIOS first, then UEFI to get Ubuntu to boot in BIOS (purple screen) mode.\n\n*Or, use the kernel option 'noefi' when booting the installer (note: I haven't actually tested this)\n\n\nA: I have a similar problem, will try to make Ubuntu installer see windows. Two years have passed, but maybe it will be useful for somebody: \nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2236762 there the problem also has been discussed, and is written how to make installed Ubuntu see win 7.\n\"Fixed it.

I've tried (^/) but that seems to exclude everything.\nHelp appreciated.\n\nA: Since the --exclude option only acts on filenames, there's no direct way to do it. You could try round-about ways like using find to print the name of all directories:\ninotifywait --exclude \"echo -n (;$(find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -printf '%P|');echo )\" .\n\nNote that I didn't specify -r, since that will cause newly created subdirectories to be watched too.\nThis might break with some special characters.\n\nYou could also try:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -printf '@%P\\n' > list_of_directories\ninotifywait --fromfile list_of_directories .\n\ninotifywait will exclude any files or folders in list_of_directories which begin with @ (all of them do).\n\nIf you're using inotifywait with the recursive option, let find list all nested subdirectories as well by removing the -maxdepth restriction (also applies to the first command):\nfind . -mindepth 1 -type d -printf '@%P\\n' > list_of_directories\ninotifywait --fromfile list_of_directories . -r\n\nThe -mindepth is retained to prevent find from matching ., and thus excluding the current directory as well.\n\nA: Just use --exclude '/\\..+'. This ignores all files that start with a dot.\n(The .+ part is so that it does not exclude your base folder).\n\nA: inotifywait only checks subdirectories because of the parameter -r.\nCall it without that parameter and it won't watch subdirectories.\n\nA: Try this way:\n/usr/bin/inotifywait -mrq --format  '%Xe %w%f' -e modify,create,delete,attrib,close_write,move --exclude '^./workspace' ./ | while read file; do\n   # do something\ndone \n\nReplace the workspace to your directory name.\n\nA: I can confirm, that --exclude 'node_modules' does the job for me, also if node_modules is a subfolder.\nwhile inotifywait -rqq -e close_write --exclude 'node_modules' \"$1\"; do $2;$3;$4; done\n\nalso tested in this:\ninotifywait --recursive --monitor --format \"%e %w%f\" \\\n  --event modify,move,create,delete  --exclude 'node_modules'  ./ |\n  while read changed; do\n    sleep .2 && ./devrun\n  done\n\n", "Q: No sound on Ubuntu 12.04 after using headphones I have a Hewlett Packard laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 installed.

Author has provided a link in the comments with a forum post where it has been solved, but for completeness, if somebody else runs into this post, here is a solution. \nThe problem with unmuting is that pressing the button unmutes only the master channel but not Pulsaudio channels. To correct this one has to modify the keybinding for XF86AudioMute button which on Lubuntu is defined in file ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.

Also the \"Headphone\\ Jack\" grep string in the HEADPHONES_PLUGGED definition might need to be something else.\nTo hook into the toggle button you should make the above script available through your ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml configuration file.\n<keybind key=\"XF86AudioMute\">\n    <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <!--command>amixer -q sset Master toggle</command-->\n        <command>/usr/local/bin/amixer-toggle.sh</command>\n    </action>\n</keybind>\n\n", "Q: Team Fortress 2 fails to launch with primus/optirun Few days ago I installed Steam, TF2, bumblebee and the newest nvidia drivers.

So, I picked sda6 (my Ubuntu partition) so that it would merge with my existing grub.

My computer default boots to Windows (that is, if I don't do anything when I press the power button, it'll boot to Windows). I want to keep this functionality. Normally, I would go and select the boot device, and then grub would come up and I could boot Ubuntu. So, I want to also be able to select ElementaryOS instead of Ubuntu. However, when I select the boot device that used to give me grub, it says error: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found and shows me the grub rescue prompt (an image is below).

Upon champion selection it crashes and won't connect to game.\n\nA: The easiest way to run LoL on Ubuntu is PlayOnLinux since they do all the fiddly config settings for you.  For example, I'm not sure if this is still the case, but originally with vanilla wine1.7 the game would crash on opening the shop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux, e.g.: sudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\n*Open PlayOnLinux and click the \"Install\" button\n\n*Make sure the \"Testing\" box is checked\n\n*Search for \"League of Legends\"\n\n*Select it and click \"Install\"\n\n\nA: This was an issue in Wine 1.6, which is the current stable version of Wine. According to the Wine AppDB, LoL has a Gold rating when using Wine 1.7. Wine 1.7 is the current development branch, but I've been using it for a while and haven't had any issues with it.

I made a simple bash script that pack a file and then upload it, if everything is fine I am getting some http:// links to my stuff as output I want to know how can I copy those links automaticaly to a file or variable? Also I am getting some lines which are not starting with http:// but with # for instance how can I delete them and add blank lines in this spot?\n\nA: To capture script output to a file, use:\nscript.sh >file.txt\n\nTo remove comments (lines starting with #) but leave the blank in their place, use:\nscript.sh | sed 's/^#.*//' >file.txt\n\nTo do all of the above while also displaying the information on the terminal, use:\nscript.sh | sed 's/^#.*//' | tee file.txt\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*> is the shell's symbol for redirection.  It tells the shell to take whatever was going to stdout and redirect to the named file instead.\n\n*sed is a line-by-line editing utility.  Here we use the sed substitute command which looks like s/old/new/ where old is any regular expression.  In our case, old is ^#.* where ^ matches at the beginning of a line, # matches the hash symbol, and .* is a wildcard to match anything that follows.  In our case, new is empty.  Thus,  sed 's/^#.*//' replaces lines that begin with # with a blank line.\n\n*tee is a utility used to make a copy of stdout.   tee file.txt will take whatever it finds on stdin and (a) save it to file file.txt while at the same time (b) send it to stdout.  If want to append to file.txt instead of overwrite it, we can use tee -a file.txt where the -a option tells tee to append.\nRefinements\nAdding text from another .txt file at the start of this file.txt\nTo place the contents of first.txt at the start of file.txt:\n{ cat first.txt; script.sh; } >file.txt\n\nCopy only lines starting with http://\nFor selecting lines according to some pattern without modifying them, grep is the right tool:\nscript.sh | grep '^http' >file.txt\n\nCopying from first line with http://*\nsed allows one to select a range of lines.  Here, we use the range /^http/,$ where /^http/ is the first line encountered that starts with http and $ is sed's symbol for the last line in the input.  p tells sed to print lines that match that range:\nscript.sh | sed -n '/^http/,$ p'\n\nCombine Adding text from another file and copying from first line with http://*\n{ cat first.txt; script.sh; } | sed -n '/^http/,$ p' >file.txt\n\nAdd a blank line after every line starting with http\nHere we use sed again.  When we find a line that starts with http, we add a newline \\n to the end of that line:\nscript.sh | sed  's/^http.*/&\\n/'\n\n", "Q: Efax-gtk using Trendnet TFM-561U modem I am running Ubuntu 14.0.4 using and external modem.

In Windows, Windows Key + P changes how an attached monitor is attached. I primarilly used it to swap between mirrored and extended views.\nIs there a similar hotkey in Ubuntu 14.04?\nTo clarify, I'm often in the situation where my built-in display is blank after being plugged into HDMI and suspendend. I think it just needs to be told to switch to a different display mode. I can't do this with a command, as I can't see what I'm typing.\nI've googled, and my google fu doesn't appear to be working well\n\nA: If you don't find a simple built-in shortcut, you can do what I do on Xubuntu and use xrandr to switch the display output. All of this might seem like a pain in the ass, but I've found it to be rock solid reliable over the years (especially compared to relying on display auto-switching).\n$ sudo apt-get install xrandr\n\nSo on my setup, this command switches to mirrored output:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output VIRTUAL1 --off \\\n--output DP1 --off --output eDP1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 2040x0 --rotate normal \\\n--same-as HDMI1 --output VGA1 --off\n\nAnd this one switches to extended desktop:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output VIRTUAL1 --off \\\n--output DP1 --off --output eDP1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 2040x0 --rotate normal \\\n--output VGA1 --off\n\nObviously, these commands are too long to be typing in, so I save them to scripts called display_TV_mirror.sh and display_TV_extend.sh, and then I bind a shortcut key to each script. In regular Ubuntu, I think you can set the shortcuts in  System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts. I use to separate scripts with two separate shortcut keys, but you could easily combine them into one switch with some toggle logic. \nNote: To find out the exact command you want to use for xrandr, it is probably easier to use arandr at first, which is basically a gui interface to xrandr. \n$ sudo apt-get install arandr\n$ arandr\n\nThen you can set up your desired config, save it to a file somewhere, then look at that file to find out what xrandr command is needed to get the setup you want. \n\nA: At least on my setup, I can switch monitor mirroring on with this command:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --same-as DP1\n\nTo turn off monitor mirroring, I use this command:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --pos 1920x0\n\nIn other words, I don't need to re-specify settings such as \"--mode 1920x1080\" and \"--rotate normal\". Simply changing between \"--same-as\" and \"--pos\" has been sufficient, at least in my case.\nThese commands have been handy for me when viewing my workplace screens from a remote laptop. My workplace screens are on a dual-monitor setup running Linux Mint, so I need an easy way to temporarily switch to mirror mode during my remote session. I can also switch mirroring on and off using the \"Super-p\" (Windows-p) Cinnamon keyboard shortcut (\"Re-detect display devices\"), but the keyboard approach sometimes crashes my VNC.\n", "Q: cannot install from terminal I cannot install things from terminal.

I could not\n  understand why it could not just use the existing pulseaudio instance,\n  without trying to spawn a new one.\nI understood thanks to this post.\nMPD could not find the already-running pulseaudio instance because the\n  environment variable XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was not set, and thet’s where\n  pulseaudio stores its files (the socket, the process pid, etc).\n\nI tried his solution:\n\ncreating a new file /etc/systemd/system/mpd.service.d/fixenv.conf\n  containing:\n[Service] Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 \n(Replace 1000 by the UNIX id of your user.)\n\nI rebooted and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was set correctly, and pulse put its pid file in the /run/user/1000/pulse/ directory (my user id is 1000), but I still get the same error from mpd:\n\npulse_output: Failed to enable \"ROCKI\" [pulse]: pa_context_connect() has failed: Connection refused\n\nI'm learning more about linux every day, but sockets, process pids, systemd (isn't Ubuntu supposed to use upstart? systemd seems to be running and launching things), etc. are all above my pay grade right now - I'm lost in the woods.\n\nA: Finally, better than pulseaudio daemon mode, the best solution is there:  it is about running mpd as yourself (and not mpd user) so you have no problem to use your own session pulseaudio.\nA  different answer , but  tested and  also working:\nconfigure pulseaudio to run as \"daemon mode\" instead of the standard \"user mode\" \n\n\n*\n\n*in a terminal, run\nsudo  gedit /etc/init/pulseaudio.conf\nthen uncomment line 20 removing # to get:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nsave and quit gedit.\n\n*Run this 2 commands in a terminal:\nsudo usermod -aG pulse,pulse-access mpd\nsudo usermod -aG pulse,pulse-access your-login\nIn the 2nd command, replace \"your-login\"   \n\n\nNow reboot: hopefully , it will work.   \nNote: For info, this page lists reasons why you must avoid pulseaudio daemon mode, but i find it ok on a single user pc (especially I see no more cpu/memory usage than user mode).\n\nA: The XDG_RUNTIME_DIR solution worked for me, but there is no need to create a file in /etc/systemd/system.  Just add this line in /etc/init.d/mpd:\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000\n\nI already have specified mpd to run as my own user and \"audio\" group in /etc/mpd.conf.\n\nA: You can try to specify   pulseaudio sink in  MPD config file:\nTo display pulseaudio sinks, run this command in a terminal:\npactl list short sinks \nIt will output something like:\n0   alsa_output.pci-0000_00_03.0.hdmi-stereo    module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz   IDLE\n1   alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo  module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz   RUNNING\n\nChoose your main sink (the 2nd one in my case because i have no HDMI sound) and copy its name in mpd.conf audio_output :\naudio_output {\n    type                    \"pulse\"\n    name                    \"MPD PulseAudio Output\"\n   sink                    \"alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\"\n\n}\n", "Q: Do I need to upgrade only the RAM for making Ubuntu's virtual machine quick and smooth as OS X at the same time?

Two answers in this question state that screen is unmaintained. However, the GNU repository of screen shows an upload this year after 6 years, and 14.04 has two newer versions than the earlier Ubuntu releases (one in the main release, and one in backports, from 14.10). Unmaintained software get dropped from Ubuntu, but screen remained even after a six-year period of inactivity. So what is the status of screen in general, and in Ubuntu?

When I first installed Ubuntu, it was using the Nouveau open-source drivers by default.

After doing so, I noticed that certain programs didn't window correctly when putting them in fullscreen, as well as the fans working harder and the laptop getting hotter than it used to.\nWhich driver should I use? Should I get the Nvidia driver directly from their website instead of the Ubuntu \"Software & Updates\" tool?\nAlso, does the system switch between using the Intel and Nvidia card depending on power settings?\nSorry for all the questions, I'm still new to Ubuntu/Linux but so far I've been enjoying it :)\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: My (older) Dell Precision m4300 runs on the hot side.

I recently did a fresh install of ubuntu on a system with an old ubuntu install. I have a separate hard-drive which used to have a single ext4 partition, but during the install I accidentally selected \"use this partition as ext3\", but did not check \"format\".\nWhen I mounted the drive, I only saw the lost+found directory (which was empty). I tried using testdisk to recover, but it only shows the lost+found, since it is a perfectly valid partition.\nI ran strings on the block device, and see tons of file names, which is why I believe the journal data is still there somewhere.\nI saw this question, which seems like exactly my situation, but didn't have enough information to help me: File recovery after reformattig ext3/4 partition -- extract old journal/superblock?\nMy current situation is that the drive still has a single ext3 partition, and I haven't written anything to it. I've been reading about ext4magic, but I'm in a bit over my head. It seems like it expects the drive to already be formatted to ext4, so should I \"upgrade\" it to ext4? I'm nervous about writing anything to it without fully understanding what I'm doing.\nThe drive contains a lot of media I'd really like to save, but nothing I can't live without. I'm really only interested in recovery if I get file names as well, it's not worth listening to thousands of songs to try to identify and name them, and everything on the drive was well organized. I also don't have enough empty space to image the entire drive (it was 2TB, probably ~0.75TB full), but if that is required, I could talk myself into buying another drive for the purpose.\nThanks in advance for reading, and even if you can point me towards some documentation I can read, that would be really helpful!

The filenames would be lost. Still the data can be recovered. If you have another big enough hard disk, create an image of this partition using dd and run photorec on the image. This would be safer. As you have created a new file system, I seriously doubt that the old journals would be still available. The backup entries might have got overwritten as well with the new journal entries. There are other data recovery tools available as well. But photorec is really easy to use and effective. \n", "Q: Installing Asus USB-N53 WiFi adapter failing I tried to install the Asus USB-N53 WiFi adapter using the instructions from the \"How do I

But of course you can setup a Linux server as a firewall or to do routing for example so in these cases you want to keep tagged packets so the switches know where to send the traffic coming out of your Linux server.\nUbuntu needs a device and drivers that are vlan, 802.1q aware.\nYou need to install the userspace tool vlan to be able to enable the configuration that your interface(s).\nsudo apt-get install vlan\n\nYou then need to load the module:\nsudo modprobe 8021q\n\nYou then need to add your physical interface to a vlan interface (which will create a new sub interface to the vlan):\nsudo vconfig add eth1 10\n\nThen finally create an ip address for the sub interface:\nsudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth1.10\n\nIf you want to make this permanent:\nAdd the module to the kernel on boot:\nsudo su -c 'echo \"8021q\" >> /etc/modules'\n\nThen create a stanza in /etc/networking/interfaces:\nauto eth1.10\niface eth1.10 inet static\n    address 10.0.0.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    vlan-raw-device eth1\n\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/vlan\n", "Q: How change display resolution settings using xrandr ubuntu 14.04 How can I change my netbook screen resolution permanently ?.\nIt is what sreen after xrandr  command\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 600, maximum 4096 x 4096\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS-0 connected primary 1024x600+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 222mm x 125mm\n   1024x600       60.0*+\n   960x600        60.0  \n   960x540        60.0  \n   800x600        60.0     60.3     56.2  \n   840x525        60.0     59.9  \n   800x512        60.2  \n   700x525        60.0  \n   640x512        60.0  \n   720x450        59.9  \n   640x480        60.0     59.9  \n   680x384        59.8     60.0  \n   576x432        60.1  \n   512x384        60.0  \n   400x300        60.3     56.3  \n   320x240        60.1  \nDVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDisplayPort-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n  1024x768_60.00 (0x19c)   63.5MHz\n        h: width  1024 start 1072 end 1176 total 1328 skew    0 clock   47.8KHz\n        v: height  768 start  771 end  775 total  798           clock   59.9Hz\n\n\nA: just type xrandr, this will list all available monitors and possible modes/resolutions that you can use.\nyou will see a star (*) on the current used mode.\nFor instance:\n>xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 2720 x 1024, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA-0 connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 340mm x 270mm\n   1280x1024     60.02 +  75.02* \n   1024x768      75.08    70.07    60.00  \n   800x600       75.00    60.32  \n   640x480       75.00    60.00  \n   720x400       70.08  \nHDMI-0 connected primary 1440x900+1280+124 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm\n   1920x1080     60.00 +\n   1280x1024     60.02  \n   1440x900      59.90* \n   1280x800      59.91  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1024x768      70.07    60.00  \n   800x600       60.32    56.25  \n   640x480       66.67    60.00  \n   720x400       70.08 \n\nTo change it, just type:\nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 1920x900\nthis will change my second monitor (connected via HDMI port) to a new resolution.\nthere are more parameters you can set, like frequency, etc.\nchenk more details with xrandr --help\n\nA: Use this command:\ngksudo -k gedit /etc/gdm/Init/Default\n\nto add the following script to the display manager default initialization configuration file:\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1600x900\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1600x900\n\nThe mode details can be found from the cvt command\ncvt -v 1440 900\n\nwhere 1440 is the screen width and 900 is the screen height.

I do most of my work in Ubuntu, but there are some Windows programs that have no good Linux equivalents and don't work in Wine, so I run those in a VirtualBox virtual machine running Windows 7.  Unfortunately, when I'm in a Linux program there is no quick way that I know of to switch to the virtual machine.  Currently the fastest way is to Alt+Tab to the two VirtualBox windows, keep holding Alt to see the both the VirtualBox Manager and the virtual machine, and then Alt+Tab once more to select the virtual machine.\nDoes anyone know how to program a hot key that will jump straight to the virtual machine?\n\nA: Sure, this is what you should do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Startup your virtual machine, write down exactly the window name as it appears in the title bar. Mine is for example:\nWindows 7 [Draaiend] - Oracle VM VirtualBox\n\n\n*The command to bring the VM's window to the front is then:\nwmctrl <window_name>\n\nNB: if name of the window contains spaces, use quotes around the name\nso in my case it would be:\nwmctrl -a \"Windows 7 [Draaiend] - Oracle VM VirtualBox\"\n\n\n*Test the command running it in a terminal window\n\n*Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcust\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". \nClick the \"+\" and add the command:\nwmctrl -a \"Windows 7 [Draaiend] - Oracle VM VirtualBox\"\n\nto a key combinbation of your choice.\nFrom man wmctrl:\n   -a <WIN>\n          Switch to the desktop containing the  window  <WIN>,  raise  the\n          window, and give it focus.\n\nIn case you run the machine from different snapshots\nor in any other case when the window name might be extended by other strings, as mentioned by OP in a comment: copy the script below into an empty file, save it as run_vm.py. Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/run_vm.py <machine_name>\n\nwhere, like in the first example, you have to put the machine name in quotes if it contains spaces.\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nmachine = sys.argv[1]\ncommand = \"wmctrl -l\"\nwlist = [(\" \").join(line.split(\" \")[4:]) for line in subprocess.check_output(\n    [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]\n    ).decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\") if machine in line][0]\ncommand2 = \"wmctrl -a \"+\"'\"+wlist+\"'\"\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command2])\n\n\nA: There is absolutely no need to run VirtualBox Manager to start a Virtual Box virtual machine. Each VM can also be started in it's own window on the command line\nVBoxManage startvm 'name of the machine'\n\nor by defining a .desktop file that can be started with a custom shortcut, from the desktop, the dash, or from the launcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add Virtualbox Shortcut in Unity Launcher to boot to a VM\nThis virtual machine windows can then conveniently be contolled by Alt + Tab.\nWe could even go a step further and seamlessly integrate a running Windows application to the Ubuntu desktop (however there may be some interference with Unity when doing so):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch an application in Windows from the Ubuntu desktop\n", "Q: How to build a deb package of a project on github?

I am developing a software using Quickly.

I have even checked the .desktop file, which points to the new icon.\nHow to change the icon from Unity's memory?\nI, however, am not sure whether this is Unity only.\n\nA: Usually, when the Icon= line is changed in a .desktop file, it should be visible in the launcher after log out/log in. When an application is re- installed its icon should change as well, there is no \"Unity memory\" as you mention it.\nPriority of .desktop files\nAnother thing is that a local version of a .desktop file (in ~/.local/share/applications) has priority over the global one in /usr/share/applications.

What if I remove the corresponding snapshot?\n\n*Any way to prevent grub from adding the root snapshot found on /bck-snapshots ?\nI have to reboot the system in order for the updates to be active, but first I have to know the answer to these questions.\n\nA: It looks like grub-mount is trying to edit a read only file system and has hung.\nIt should be safe to send a signal with kill to ask it to give up (send 15, and if needed after a few seconds 2, and if needed after a few seconds 1, if it's still running use -9 and report it to the maintainer) (if the pid number changes start with 15 again )\nIt's likely to exit non-zero which may effect scripts waiting on it, but the only thing you can do about that is file a bug report and ask the maintainer to have it skip read only file systems.\nNote that there are some related bugs they are working on.\n\nA: Just kill that leftover grub-mount process. This happened to me as well, and there was no apparent negative side-effect to the killing, because the relevant update-grub process had already abandoned it - you can easily verify that by seeing how it the leftover grub-mount process no longer has a parent.\n", "Q: Kill SSHFS at shutdown?

Ubuntu 14.10 + fglrx 14.201 + AMD A10-7700K = no OpenCL.\nTrue? Hopefully someone out there knows the answer.\n\nA: Ubuntu dropped support for the old fglrx drivers in 14.04.04 recent patches (they USED to work but Ubuntu changed something that BROKE the support, so you pretty much have to stick with 14.04.03 or earlier).\nAMD has NEVER offered any \"official\" support for OpenCL on the A10 series in their ROCm or AMDGPU-PRO series drivers that DO work with more recent Ubuntu versions, and it appears they plan to NEVER DO SO even though they DO support discrete GPUs that are OLDER than many of the A10 series APUs.\nThe ROCm stack will SOMETIMES work with the GCN-based A10 APUs (A10-6xxx I think, and definitely the A10-7xxx and later), but that's very hit-or-miss on if it will work or not on a given installation - and is NOT officially supported, so forget getting any SUPPORT out of AMD on such a setup.\nAlso, if you are going to use fglrx at all, it would be better to use the final release version 14.302 instead of the older .201 version\nCorresponds to AMD driver version 15.12 (.201 I believe was 15.07 or so).\n", "Q: To recover my Ubuntu data In my system i have install noth windows and Ubuntu.

A solution is mentioned in this question. Adding a GPG key is easy. You need the ID of the pubkey that's missing, and it's displayed in the error message you get. In your case, the ID is 78414460095F1873.

I want to use emacs and console tools instead of Ubuntu SDK to edit and debug my projects.\nWhere can I learn about doing that?\n\nA: You certainly can! The SDK is meant to make it a bit easier, but nothing prevents you from doing it yourself (and perhaps making it a step in your CI environment). Michael Zanetti wrote up a blog post about it here.\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu from a Flash Drive I need to run Ubuntu 14.04 on a notebook to test certain remote services but I don't want that OS permanently installed on that computer. So I have figured out I could run an Ubuntu installation from a flash drive.\nI have downloaded Ubuntu ISO file, made the Live CD, booted up, inserted second flash drive and installed Ubuntu on it. At the beginning of installation I had \n/dev/sda1 with Windows OS, /dev/cdrom - my first flash drive with Ubuntu Live CD and /dev/sdc with my second flash drive. I have created Ext4 partition on /dev/sdc and got /dev/sdc1. I chose /dev/sdc1 for installation of Ubuntu and the same /dev/sdc1 for GRUB location. I didn't do a swap as I considered it will use the flash drive heavily and will not be good for the speed sake and also for the flash drive itself.\nThe installation went through fine.\nNow I can choose in my BIOS what drive to boot from. I can boot from the hard drive and get Windows running as it was before. But if I choose to boot from that second flash drive I have installed Ubuntu on I get black screen with a cursor flashing.\nIs there something wrong with the Grub settings on that second flash drive? And if so how can I edit that Grub without having a possibility to boot up?\n\nA: how much time do you stay in that black screen until you quit?\nTake in account that the USB connection is slower than sata and it will take some time to boot.\nI cannot be 100% sure that is not an installation problem, so you can try to edit the files into the flash drive with some software for reading ext4 file system from windows.\nFew year ago I install ubuntu in a external drive by USB connection and had no problem with the installation neither working with the system. May be you can try to install Ubuntu again.\n", "Q: Synaptics drives is not working correctly When I start up Ubuntu, in the Mouse & Touchpad settings, the Touchpad is not shown. And the double-finger scroll as well as other gestures provided by synaptics driver will not work.\nAfter execute:\n\nsudo rmmod psmouse\nsudo insmod /lib/modules/3.13.0-39-generic/kernel/drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.ko\n\nThe option will show up.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nI find that the psmouse module is loaded after boot (but not correctly, I will explain later). I have to run sudo modprobe -r psmouse and sudo modprobe psmouse to make the touchpad work in the right way.\nI find that the original content of /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf is options psmouse proto=imps, and I that proto=imps option is not right for me. I am saying so because when I comment out that line and run  sudo modprobe psmouse, my touchpad will be all right, and if I don't, the touchpad option will not appear.\nMy guess is that at boot time, Ubuntu load the psmouse module with the proto=imps option for me. I wonder how to change that behavior?\n\nI added the following lines to /etc/rc.local\nsudo rmmod psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\nAnd it's OK now, but I believe that this is not the best way. I still want to know why the module is not loaded right by the OS.\n\nA: I added the following lines to /etc/rc.local\nsudo rmmod psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\nAnd it's OK now, but I believe that this is not the best way. \n", "Q: SSH allow windows AD groups(with Special charactors) I have join my linux to windows domain succesfully, and now everyone in the domain is able to log in to the server by using ssh.\nBut we only want to allow certain users from a group to log in.\nExample of current two groups:\n#it_admin\n\nDomain Admin\n\n\nA: You can do this in two ways. One is to let the SSH configuration filter, and the other is to use pam_access.\nUsing SSH configuration\nTo /etc/ssh/sshd_config, add a AllowGroups line:\nAllowGroups Domain Admin\n\nFrom the manpage:\nAllowGroups\n    This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns,\n    separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only for\n    users whose primary group or supplementary group list matches one\n    of the patterns.\n\nDomain Admin here doesn't match Domain Admin the group name, but two separate groups Domain and Admin. You'll have to use something like Domain*Admin and *it_admin, since neither  (space) nor (#) are usually valid characters in Linux groups. To be on the safer side, use ? instead of *: Domain?Admin and ?it_admin, so that only one character is allowed by the wildcard. You can also add a pattern-based DenyGroups section. See the PATTERNS section in man ssh_config.\nUsing pam_access\nAdd lines to /etc/security/access.conf of the form:\n- : ALL EXCEPT (Domain) (Admin) : ALL\n\nThere are plenty of comments in that file which document how to use it. man pam_access is quite bare, so most information would come from those comments. pam_access is more powerful in that it can control non-SSH logins as well (TTYs, GUI, etc.). This particular line, for example, should deny any user who does not have Domain or Admin as a group from logging in at all (unless other lines allow them).\nBoth approaches are pretty flexible, and I don't know the pros and cons, so no recommendations.\n", "Q: Ubuntu file sharing server (with samba) using external hard drive I'm trying to configure a file sharing server using Ubuntu server (with samba). I want the shared files to be saved on an external hard drive (2TB) because the space on the desktop's (which is a new one by the way) hard drive may not be sufficient.\nMy question is: On installation, how do i partition such that i have the OS on the computer's hard drive and the file server on the external hard drive? OR is there a better way of doing this? A \"How to\" guide will be appreciated. \n\nA: After lots of research i've found an answer. Decided to answer incase anyone else ever needs this:\nSo the best way to do this (i think) is to install ubuntu on the computer's hard drive and then use the external drive for file shares.\nAfter installing ubuntu on the internal drive, format the external drive to ext4 (ext3 if you wish). You can do this from the command line. Create only one primary partition since this will be used for only file storage. Check out this link for how to format a drive from command line: http://www.ehow.com/how_5853059_format-linux-disk.html\nOnce you've done that, you need to mount the drive. Create a new folder in /media For example, we can call it \"ext\". Run \"mkdir /media/ext\". You're going to mount the drive to this folder.\nRun \"fdisk -l\" to get the /dev/xxx name of the partition on the external hard drive. Lets say it's /dev/sdb1. Then, run \"mount /dev/sdb1 /media/external\" to mount the drive to the /media/external folder.\nThat's it. The drive has been partitioned.\nThen, you can create your folders for your samba shares in the /media/ext folder and this will create them on the external drive. For example, If you run \"mkdir /media/ext/Public\", this would create a folder called Public on the drive. It could then point to /media/external/Public in the samba configuration file (path = /media/external/Public).\nHope it helps\n", "Q: invoke a script on fail of a bash script I want to run a script  that create and host a website with apache server.\nif anything went wrong I have to rollback all the changes I made, like delete the created folder etc.\nI know set -e exits the script while detecting an error.\nBut what I need is run a script, say rollback.sh, while detecting an error instead exiting\n\nA: Within the script, you can use trap:\nerr_handler () {\n   /path/to/error/handling/script.sh\n   exit\n}\n\ntrap err_handler ERR\n\nSince ERR is trapped, if any command exits with an non-zero exit code, err_handler function will be run.\nYou can think of set -e as doing this:\ntrap 'exit $?'

Problem persists.\n\nThe only working solution I have found is to unbind and bind the device driver using the following commands:\nsudo bash -c ' \\\n  echo -n \"0000:00:14.0\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind && \\\n  echo -n \"0000:00:14.0\" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/bind;'\n\nI must do this every time between connecting a USB 3.0 storage device and suspending the computer but it works consistently.\nIt should be noted that the xhci_hcd component of the path is only valid for USB 3.0 devices. This part of the path will need to be varied depending on the type of bus that needs to be reset, and might be one of uhci_hcd, sdhci-pci or ehci-pci for other types of storage device.\n\nA: Sorry for adding an answer but I don't have enough reputation to add comments...\n(Which is why I'm looking at your problem!) ;-) :P\nHave you tried resetting the USB bus the disk was just disconnected from before suspending?\nIf you don't know how, could you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the machine\n\n*Unplug all USB devices\n\n*Remove all power cables, UPSes, batteries, ...\n\n*Power on the machine (yes: without power cables!)\n\n*Put back all power removed in step 3\n\n*Boot the machine\n\n*Do a: lsusb --verbose > /tmp/good-bus.txt 2>&1\n\n*Plug in the disk\n\n*Do a: lsusb --verbose > /tmp/bad-bus.txt 2>&1\n\n*Unmount the disk\n\n*Eject the disk\n\n*Remove the disk\n\n*Do a: lsusb --verbose > /tmp/worse-bus.txt 2>&1\n\n*Do a: diff --text /tmp/good-bus.txt /tmp/bad-bus.txt > /tmp/test-g-b.txt\n\n*Do a: diff --text /tmp/good-bus.txt /tmp/worse-bus.txt > /tmp/test-g-w.txt\nAnd then report back here with the output of /tmp/test-g-b.txt and /tmp/test-g-w.txt\n", "Q: Is it possible to embed a pdf reader in QupZilla browser?

I don't know why this doesn't work (ie. it doesn't work!). Since the kparts plugin is loaded I suspect it must be a error in the kparts plugin configuration.\nUntil now I've just translated and copied the relevant stuff from what others said.

Is there any way to solve this problem? \n\nA: Your folders need to have x bit set. So set your permissions as 775 (or 755) as you see fit to all folders. You can do a chmod -R 755 ~/Music, that will change permissions recursively on all files inside too. An explanation of how permission bits are treated differently for directories can be found here; in our case:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*The execute bit allows the affected user to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside.\n  \n\n", "Q: Trendnet TFM-561U modem permissions How do I give myself permission to use my modem in my machine?

These can be found in /dev like this:\n$ ls -l /dev/ttyS*\ncrw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Nov  3 09:37 /dev/ttyS0\n[...]\n\nNotice the permissions set to root and the dialout group for the example listed. To be able to read/write to the device as a regular user, just make sure you're a member of this group. Several options to do this exist: through the user management in system settings or command line like this:\nsudo adduser username dialout\n\nThen log out of your Ubuntu session and log back in (or simply reboot) to make this change effective.\nIn case of trouble, check with id whether you're indeed a member and verify with ls -l on the device what permissions you need. In the unlikely case your modem driver doesn't use the regular ACM/serial driver interfacing, edit your question to include these details (we don't have this specific modem).\n", "Q: cannot boot windows 8.1 after installing ubuntu 14.04 (for dual boot) yesterday I installed ubuntu 14.04 in my windows 8.1(preinstalled) lenovo 14R willing to dual boot it with windows 8.1.I created a different partition and a 2gb partition for swap.

Foram ignorados ou os antigos foram usados em seu lugar.\n\n\nA: It looks like you still don't authenticate properly.\nThere may be a number of reasons for that - like special characters in your password, where it may be better to replace them by their code, I think.\nIf you have windows proxy server - cntlm might help.\nI think actually that if you use package manager and give credentials there in the config - it might also work. Or in System config - and try to update in the gui, to see if it works.\n\nA: I solved my problem with this program: microsoft-isa-proxy-authentication\nMicrosoft ISA Proxy authentication in Ubuntu\nHow to solve \"407 Proxy Authentication Required\" error in Ubuntu ?\nThis was one question I was behind from last few days. Use CNTLM, that's the best answer I got.\nCNTLM will make your Ubuntu server act as a proxy server and in behind authenticates with your actual proxy server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the package file from the CNTLM website. While writing this, version 0.92.3 is the latest.\n\n*Install .deb file, e. g.:\nsudo dpkg -i cntlm_0.92.3_i386.deb\n\n\n*The CNTLM configuration file is located at /etc/cntlm.conf. Open it using your preferred text editor in edit mode. If you use gedit, type sudo gedit /etc/cntlm.conf.\n\n*In cntlm.conf edit the following fields:\nUsername   YOUR_USERNAME_HERE\nDomain     YOUR_ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN\nPassword YOUR_PASSWORD\nProxy  YOUR_PROXY_SERVER_IP_WITH_PORT\nNoProxy LIST_ALL_IP_WITH_NO_PROXY_REQUIREMENT\nListen SOME_PORT\n\nSample config here:\nUsername   0906895\nDomain     ABC\nPassword   rndmpasswd@123\nProxy  10.18.200.203:8080\nProxy  10.18.200.204:8080\nNoProxy  localhost, 127.0.0.*, 10.*\nListen  8080\n\n\n*After changes in configuration files, restart the CNTLM service:\nsudo service cntlm restart\n\n\n*Now CNTLM started working and your Ubuntu server is acting as another proxy server. So add localhost as the system proxy server:\nGo to System -> Preference -> Network Proxy. In the Network Proxy Preference window, set manual proxy configuration, proxy server as localhost and port as the port number you specified in Listen SOME_PORT.\n", "Q: Fullscreen Video Tearing on Ubuntu 14.10 (Haswell Graphics) Over the past few weeks, I have noticed that I've had video tearing issues in Google Chrome on YouTube (and such other sites) with the video tearing when I put it on fullscreen. It might be an issue with HTML5 players, but I'm not sure. I can't remember if this problem was present in Ubuntu 14.04 or not.\n\nA: This problem was happening on Ubuntu 16.04 on my Macbook Pro. I solved it with these steps:\n sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager \n\nThen go to General -> Composite and uncheck \"Unredirect Fullscreen Windows\". Best of luck!\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 not working after kernel update how can I save my ubuntu system? ubuntu 14.04 not working after kernel update how can I save my ubuntu system?\nyesterday , when I updated the ubuntu 14.04 and its kernel core , it  asked me for a reboot! and then I cant access to my ubuntu , but it shows grub page corectly and after enter to it I see just a black page\nhow can I save my system?\n\nA: Most probably the new kernel doesn't have the modules that comes with your proprietary driver and fails to use your configuration files. If you still have the boot menu that comes with a default Ubuntu installation then you can choose \"Recovery mode\". In the next menu choose to boot into safe mode, and if Ubuntu asks if you want to create a new configuration file just allow it to do so. There should be other ways to generate new configuration (like deleting some dot files) but I just know this way.\nThen when everything is OK reinstall the graphic driver.\nEdit: to boot into recovery mode see the question How do I prevent GRUB from using/starting any graphical UI?\n", "Q: How to edit tags in AAC files? In the old days, there used to be an EasyTag extension specifically for this purpose. Today there does not seem to be one and EasyTag does not list AAC files in its GUI. Rythmbox issues an error editing AAC files.\nIs there any other way of doing it?\n\nA: You should try EasyTAG harder, as its webpage says:\n\nEasyTAG is a simple application for viewing and editing tags in audio files. It supports MP3, MP2, MP4/AAC, FLAC, Ogg Opus, Ogg Speex, Ogg Vorbis, MusePack, Monkey's Audio, and WavPack files\n\n\nA: Trusty Tahr 14.04 ships with EasyTag 2.1.10 and this release incorporates an important change dealing with m4a/aac tagging. Taken from the Ubuntu Changelog:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Switch to TagLib for MP4 tag editing and drop libmp4v2 support\n  \n\nThis change was introduced for Easytag 2.1.8-1 and gets around the licensing issues which made it difficult for Debian / Ubuntu to have a version of Easytag in the repository that could edit aac files. \nSo from Trusty Tahr onward there is no need for installing extensions, recompiling, adding PPAs, searching for other applications; to edit the metadata in m4a / aac files you simply need:\nsudo apt-get install easytag\n\nHappy tagging :)\n\nA: A workaround would be to rename you files from *.aac to *.m4a.\nThen EasyTag will be able to see the files and edit the tags normally, that's what I just did.\nIf you really want to keep the file extension, you can always rename them back to *.aac afterwards.\n\nA: I don't have an AAC file at hand, but I believe that kid3 does it.\nInstall it using the software center or get the latest version here: http://kid3.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Monitor PPPOE connection with vnstat I've try\nvahid@DEMON:~$ ifconfig \neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  \n...\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n...\n\nppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  \n...\n\nvboxnet0  Link encap:Ethernet  \n...\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  \n...\n\nThen\nvahid@DEMON:~$ vnstat -i ppp0\n\nand got this error:Error: Unable to read database \"/var/lib/vnstat/ppp0\".\nThen\nvahid@DEMON:~$ vnstat -u  -i ppp0\n\nAnd got these error: Error: Unable to read database \"/var/lib/vnstat/ppp0\".\nError: Unable to write database \"/var/lib/vnstat/ppp0\".\nCould you please help me?\n\nA: When you run vnstat -u you will need to use sudo \nso do the below command with sudo \n sudo vnstat -u  -i ppp0\n\nIf all goes ok it should create a database.\nNow configure /etc/vnstat.conf to monitor ppp0 interface \nInterface \"ppp0\"\n\nand then restart vnstat \n/etc/init.d/vnstat restart\n\n", "Q: How can I remove Ubuntu without using live-cd/usb I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my notebook.

The easiest way to install the Rcmdr package is to run R as root and issue the command install.packages(\"Rcmdr\") at the R prompt.  R will ask you to select a CRAN mirror; pick the first, \"0-Cloud\" mirror, or a mirror site near you.\nOn Ubutu systems, in particular, the following procedure should work (slightly modified from a suggestion by Ista Zahn):\n\n\n*\n\n*to Ubuntu (see http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/)\nfor ubuntu bionic      \necho \"deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install base R and the R dev package: \nsudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev\n\n\n*Start R from the Ubuntu command line as root so you can install packages system-wide: \nsudo R\n\n\n*From the R command prompt, install Rcmdr:  \ninstall.packages(\"Rcmdr\")\n\n\n\n*\n\n*R will ask you to select a CRAN mirror\n\n*pick the first, \"0-Cloud\" mirror, or a mirror site near you.\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to install R and R packages from the Ubuntu package respository but these are almost always out of date.\nWhen you first load the Rcmdr package with the command library(Rcmdr), it will offer to download and install missing dependencies; allow it to do so.\n\nA: ensure that you have the R interpreter installed. open the R interpreter (from the command line: R) and run install.package(\"Rcmdr\") in the interpreter.\nOnce this finishes, then run library(Rcmdr).

I don't want gnome-keyring to get in the way of my git commits, partially because it locks the entire screen while asking for a password, even on KDE (though I have now switched to GNOME). While I do appreciate the convenience of not having to put my SSH passphrase in each time, having to jump from window to window cancels that out personally. It's just a comfort thing :/\nI tried git config --global --unset credential.helper and git config --system --unset credential.helper, but they seem to have no effect. As I'm now using GNOME, I'd rather not remove gnome-keyring. Is there any other option I can do? I'm presently on Ubuntu 14.10, having done this both with Kubuntu and with Ubuntu GNOME. Thanks.\nUPDATE 17 November 2014\nThis apparently affects all of SSH. I tried doing\nsudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\nbut that did not work. I CAN do\ngnome-keyring-daemon --replace -c pkcs11,secrets,gpg\n\nonce each session, but I would like to keep that permanent. Still looking...\n\nA: I can't speak for Ubuntu releases other than Trusty — and GNOME is such a constant moving target that you can guarantee that every release will be different — but this is what I've found to most reliably work:\nmkdir -p ~/.config/autostart\ncp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop ~/.config/autostart/\necho \"X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\" >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\nSession start up under Unity, at least, and quite probably GNOME3, too, is weird: it will run Upstart scripts out of /usr/share/upstart/sessions/ and then runs all the autostart desktop entries under /etc/xdg/autostart and gnome-keyring, and many other things are in both (and it probably runs things in /usr/share/upstart/xdg/autostart, too; I didn't test that). \nThe gnome-keyring-ssh upstart entry will check for that X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false line in either the system or user local .desktop entry and back out, then the standard ssh-agent session will run. The system-wide gnome-keyring-ssh will then start up out of /etc/xdg/autostart unless you have a matching entry in your user local autostart, in which case that will be run instead. \nIt used to be enough just to have that enable=false line in the local autostart, but sometime recently (as in, since May 2016, over two years into Trusty's LTS period) that behaviour changed and you need something resembling a full entry. I'm still investigating the precise set of keys necessary, and the offending package update responsible.\nWhy the GNOME people didn't just proxy through to the OpenSSH key agent is anyone's guess. You might like to suggest they adopt a more sensible behaviour in this Bugzilla entry.\n\nA: I always end up uninstalling gnome-keyring \nsudo apt-get remove gnome-keyring\n\nTurns out, if you use many keys (more than three) you can't really log in to hosts that limits attempts to three... Also, gnome-keyring names the keys differently than when using ssh-add, so I don't know what passphrase to use.\nUninstalling gnome-keyring might break a lot of stuff on GNOME, I wouldn't know as I use Kubuntu. On Kubuntu all that disappears in addition are python-ubuntu-sso-client and ubuntu-sso-client.\n\nA: Nice, clean way to disable only the ssh-agent component of gnome-kerying:\ngconftool-2 --set --type bool /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false\n\n\nA: Just copy the relevant .desktop file from /etc/xdg/autostart to ~/.config/autostart and add Hidden=true to it:\n(cat /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop; echo Hidden=true) > ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\nthen reload gnome-shell (press Alt + F2, then type r and press Enter).\nThis is the only user-friendly solution that has worked for me (ie not having to softlink the .desktop file to /dev/null or chmod 0 the gnome-keyring-daemon). In fact, softlinking to /dev/null stopped working for me in GNOME 3.16.\nCredit goes to nus.\n\nA: Solution: Disable gnome-keyring using dpkg-divert\nsudo dpkg-divert --local --rename /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon \n\nNext time you log in, it'll be gone. That one line is all you need, but read on for an explanation and warnings.\nShort Explanation\nThis solution renames the program to gnome-keyring-daemon.distrib so it cannot be found.\nWhen you log in, instead of gnome-keyring trying to handle ssh integration, password requests will go directly to ssh-agent. You can unlock your ssh key for git commits using the usual ssh-add command.\nCaveats and remorse\nGnome Keyring is deeply intertwangled with the Gnome Desktop. Without it, some things may stop functioning until a replacement is installed.\nTo re-enable Gnome Keyring\nsudo dpkg-divert --remove --rename /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon \n\nYou might be using Gnome Keyring and not know it\nMany applications that can save your passwords, such as Chromium and Evolution, encrypt them using a master key stored in Gnome Keyring. Disabling Gnome Keyring prevents access to all those stored passwords. It is a good idea before disabling Gnome Keyring to backup the saved passwords.\nBacking up the Gnome Keyring\nYou can backup your keys by copying the files in ~/.local/share/keyrings/. The secrets are encrypted so, depending upon your security stance, you may wish to back them up as plain text. To do so, use the \"Passwords and Keys\" program (aka \"Seahorse\") to temporarily set an empty password for the Login Keyring. (Tip: Seahorse hides the change password option in the right-click context menu.)\nWarning: Passwords may stored in plaintext\nChromium and Google Chrome rely on a daemon called \"Secret Service\" to get an encryption key for saved passwords. If Secret Service is missing, which it will be once you disable Gnome Keyring, they will save your passwords unencrypted. Unlike Firefox, chromium based browsers do not currently provide a way to manually set a Primary Password.\nFreedesktop.org's Secret Service Integration\nGnome Keyring is only one of the programs which can act as the Secret Service daemon. To ensure that saved passwords are encrypted in Chromium and Evolution, you can install keepassxc and enable Secret Service in the settings.\nFurther explanation\nWhy not just use chmod or mv?\nChanges via chmod or mv will revert when the system is updated. By using dpkg, this solution will persist through anything, even an upgrade to a new release of Ubuntu.\nIs there a less drastic way?\nAt the time of writing, it does not appear to be possible to tell Gnome Keyring to continue providing Secret Service Integration and stop messing with ssh-agent. For many people that would be ideal, so hopefully Gnome will add that option in the future.\nWhy other methods don't work\nOver the years, many different solutions have been proposed only to be broken in the next release. Here's a short summary of why not.\nConfiguring Gnome Keyring\nThe ideal solution would be to configure Gnome Keyring to do the right thing. There actually is a command line option --components which almost works. It allows one to specify which components to initialize:\ngnome-keyring-daemon --components secrets,ssh,pkcs11\n\nOne could omit ssh from the list and, theoretically, it would not muck up ssh authentication. Unfortunately, that was not my experience. Perhaps the problem was that gnome-keyring was getting launched from multiple locations (see below), but the short of it is: there is no way to tell Gnome Keyring to never load the ssh component, only to say not now.\napt remove gnome-keyring\nThe obvious solution of removing the gnome-keyring package also uninstalls all the packages which depend on it, including gnome-core. While there are ways around it, it is easy to accidentally end up uninstalling the entire GNOME Desktop environment.\nMultiple vectors of attack\nOne of the things that makes gnome-keyring-daemon so hard to kill is that it is launched via (at least) four different methods at login, each of which must be disabled in a particular way.\n\n*\n\n*PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) in /etc/pam.d/gdm-password\n\n*systemd user service and socket\n\n*systemd user session.slice in /usr/share/dbus-1/services/\n\n*XDG autostart in /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-*.desktop\n\n\nA: I confirm that the script\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport gnomekeyring\ngnomekeyring.unlock_sync(None,\"mypassword\");\n\nresolves the issue in 16.04, amd64. The script may be saved as ukr.py, then chmod +x ukr.py, then add ukr.py as a startup application in gnome-session-properties. The (additional) module gnomekeyring is installed via\nsudo apt-get install python-gnomekeyring\n\n\nA: The easiest way is just to replace existing gnome-keyring-daemon session using command:\ngnome-keyring-daemon --replace --daemonize --components=pkcs11,secrets,gpg\n\nYou can see my full answer on this thread https://askubuntu.com/a/786722/556814\n\nA: For me, this worked great:\n$ unset GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL\n\nI saw this solution here\n", "Q: How do I install ec2-api-tools in 14.10 utopic? $ sudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools\nReading package lists...

In the system settings Ubuntu says \"Gallium 0.4 on AMD PALM\". The system is on a 100Gb partition.\nWhat can be the problem with it?\n\nA: Your Acer Aspire One 722 netbook has no discrete graphics processor, so your AMD C60 dual-core 1.333GHz processor has to do all the graphics processing using the integrated AMD Radeon HD 6290 graphics processor. Ubuntu's Unity desktop is too heavy for your CPU and it's slowing your operating system down. You would get better performance if you installed an Ubuntu flavor with a lightweight desktop environment, either Xubuntu or Lubuntu. Lubuntu looks clunky like Windows XP, but it is even more lightweight than Xubuntu in case Xubuntu is also too slow.  \nBecause the choice is down to Xubuntu vs. Lubuntu, hopefully someone who has had experience with a similar processor to yours will be able answer the question of whether Xubuntu would run OK on your netbook.\n", "Q: How can I make a two-finger tap on touch pad take me to my desktop?

Assuming I understood it right, it's because applesmc uses /dev/input/js0 for the MacBook Pro's motion sensors (I think they're the ones used to detect if it's on a level surface). How important are the motion sensors in system use? Is it safe to get rid of /dev/input/js0? If so, how to do it safely?\n\nBackground to the input problem I'm having is with Skyrim on Wine. If I'm running in any direction during a lag spike, my character gets stuck running in that direction regardless of other directional input or whether character is on auto-run. What fixed it for most people were disabling gamepad/joystick settings. I've disabled it through the game's settings and .ini files, yet the problem persists which led me to look into whether or not it's js0-related.\n\nA: You have to blacklist it with udev. I went here first:\nhttps://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist\nI wanted to add a Rumblepad.

I have been trying to reach the Edubuntu website for about three days now.  I keep gettign a 404 error \"You don't have permission to access this site.\"  Is there something I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: The site was running Drupal 7. A cached version of one of their pages confirms:\n<meta name=\"Generator\" content=\"Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)\" />\n\nThere was recently a vulnerability published for Drupal 7. The disclosure was somewhat bungled and attack code ended up in the wild within ~7 hours of the disclosure. It's thought that millions of sites were exploited before they could be patched.\nWhen an exploit of this ilk arrives, it can very quickly be plugged into existing botnets and the internet is scanned quickly by bad people. Same happened with Heartbleed and Shellshock.\nI can't speak for the Edubuntu team, but when your site has a possibility of having been hacked, and you have no method to prove otherwise, or you know you were hacked, you need to audit the site offline to make sure it wasn't exploited, reverse any damage and  update it. This can often mean rebuilding a site with a clean codebase.\n", "Q: Unchecking all desktop effects in Kubuntu 14.10 Plasma 4 I use Kubuntu 14.10 Plasma 4. Is there any way to uncheck all desktop effects at once, or do I have to do it one by one?\n\n\nA: No, there is not. \n\n\n*\n\n*The list is not big\n\n*People who want it are rather rare. \n\n\nYou can totally disable compostion manager with (by default) the Ctrl+Alt+F12 key combo. But it is not the same as disabling all effects.\nIf you wanted it for some sort of script, you could do it with manual config editing. Ask separate question for it. \n", "Q: Anchor htop to one specific process? I have a long list of processes displayed in htop, but I am only interested in one of them. As old processes terminate and new processes are spawned, htop keeps updating the displayed list of processes, which means that the one process I am interested in keeps jumping up and down the list.\nIs it possible to disable this behavior somehow?\nThat is, I would like to anchor the scroll to this particular process. How can I do this?\n\nA: You can't anchor a given process line to the top but htop can follow a process if you press Shift+F. From the man page:\n\n   F    \"Follow\" process: if the sort order causes the currently  selected\n        process  to  move  in  the list, make the selection bar follow it.\n        This is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep  a\n        process  always  visible  on  screen. When a movement key is used,\n        \"follow\" loses effect.\n\n\nHere I'm following my Firefox process:\n\nNote that if you're only interested in one particular process, the -p <pid> will do what you want (12352 is the pid of Firefox on my system):\n$ htop -p 12352\n\n\n\nA: You can do a filter using F3 and type a part of the command into the input field for the filter. This will at least narrow down your list of processes to stop other unrelated commands from pushing those your interested in down or up the page.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 High DPI Intel HD Graphics Not Supported On my Lenovo t540p running Ubuntu 14.10, the animations associated with expo, window spread, minimize, and workspace switch are choppy when the resolution is set above 1920x1080.

I have a >2GB file to transfer from PC1 to PC2 and I got a timeout message by using the usual way, i.e. using the menu of gnome-classic (network, windows icon, etc). Therefore I did this in my home directory:  \nsudo mount -t cifs //PC2/PARTAGE/ Windows/ -o  username=USERNAME,rw,user,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777\n\nAnd that works ! The directory ${HOME}/Windows of PC1 is mounted on //PC2/PARTAGE (partage = share in English, it is the name of my shared folder)\nBUT the transfer rate is about 14MBytes/s, instead of 50-70MBytes/s as usual (PC1 and PC2 are related to each other by a gigabit switch, I never reach 100MBytes/s probably because of the ethernet cables).\nWhy is this method slower ? It is my question. What is wrong in this method ? \n\nA: This issue may be that you are mounting it as a filesystems etc, which is more complicated - using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) would be ideal for this, as it just transferring a file. To use it you first need to install a server (probably easiest on the Ubuntu machine)  - you can do that with: \nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\nYou then need to edit the security settings so not anyone can log in - you can do this by running sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf, and replacing anonymous_enable=YES with anonymous_enable=NO. You may also want to set the write_enable entry,  depending on whether you want to allow files to be created over FTP or not. You can then save (Ctrl+O) and exit (Ctrl+X).\nYou then need to restart vsftpd (I think this is the right command...)\nsudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart \n\nYou then need a FTP client (on the Windows machine) to access the FTP server - for Windows FileZilla is good, but is hosted on Sourceforge, which now sadly has many ad fake download links, and now has adware installers for some of the more popular apps12 (I don't think the version FileZilla_3.9.0.6_win32-setup.exe here has this issue (though it did - looks fine under Wine anyway)) - basically don't use the installer if it looks like this:\n\nYou can then enter the IP address and login details of the Ubuntu machine, and transfer the files.\nNOTE: Note if you want something potentially more secure you can use SFTP - this can be done by using a SSH server on the Linux machine (using the openssh packages), and sftp in Filezilla.\n\nA: Install sftp package on Ubuntu machine:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\nNow it's working fine.\n", "Q: Displaying more than 10 recently used applications in Kubuntu 14.10 Plasma 4 with Kickoff Application Launcher Is there any way to display more than 10 recently used applications in Kubuntu 14.10 Plasma 4 with the (Kickoff Application Launcher)?\nUsing the GUI settings I am limited to 10:\n\n\nA: I could not find the answer for you.

I have been trying to install Xunbuntu 12.04 from CD image on an ACER TravelMate 2350. I got as far as creating a user account only for the system only for it to crash out.  I restarted the install again, got past the user account creation this time and the install had started but this time got the following:\n\nInstallation Failed [Errno 5] Input/Output error:\n  '/rofs/usr/share/ubiquity-slideshow' This is often due to a faulty\n  CD/DVD disk or drive.

Where would I raise this bug report?\nI'm new to Linux so any help that can be given would be much appreciated.\n\nA: That sounds frustrating.  When you say you used a CD image, I presume that you downloaded an .iso file and are installing from a flash drive.  If you downloaded the file manually then I'd say you should download it again, and check the MD5 or SHA1 hash to verify that the file is byte-for-byte correct.\nIf you're unfamiliar with MD5 and SHA1, they are mathematical algorithms used to test a file, with the result being a very large number, called a \"hash\", expressed in hexidecimal, such as \"79044a88855c51c82ce8725130436794631d5e0a\".  Changing even one bit of the file results in a completely different number.  (They are also used in cryptography because it is very difficult to create a file that will result in a given hash.)\nYou can download free programs to compute MD5 or SHA1 hashes for Windows or any other modern OS.

In the top right corner you would see the network icon. Make sure \"Enable networking\" is selected. Then either edit or create your wireless connection.\nHoping your router has DHCP on you would want ipv4 and ipv6 on automatic. That would leave ethernet. Assuming your hardware is functional and detected you would have the option to select a mac address for it (eth0 if there are no other network devices).\nThen if that doesn't do it i would validate the router and the firewall. Assuming you have a network cable i would plug the computer directly to the modem. Repeat the directives above for a cabled connection. Then validate your firewall is not causing trouble by disabling it shortly and just testing a random google search.\nThe log you posted leads me to think your wi-fi device is detected and working but needs to be configured correctly.\n\nA: I recommend strongly that you upgrade this kernel before.

We would need to know brand/make/model of that pendrive to be able to tell you if it has one (edit it into your question). Example with a random pendrive (see the \"lock\" on the side):\n\n\n\n\n\n*You need to mount the pendrive writable. How is the pendrive mounted? If it is automatic when inserting option 1 is probably true. If you manually mount it please provide the mount command; probably it has a \"ro\" option where you need a \"rw\".\n\n\nA: In Gparted, use \"Create new partition table\" option in menu, while having your pendrive chosen. The proper one is msdos (read: MBR).  Then apply. \nIf this does not work, your pendrive is blocked at hardware level. \n\nA: The first guess about the \"write protect\" switch on the usb device is a pretty good one. If you rule that out, the problem probably is in the file system that sits underneath the partitions on it.\nYou should use fdisk to obliterate the partition and create a new file system on the device. Don't just repartition or make new folders.  Make a partition with, say, ext4. If you open a terminal and run\nsudo /sbin/fdisk -l\n\nIf you don't have GPT partition table (the new kind), this should show drives like \"/dev/sda\" and so forth.  \nDevice         Start        End    Sectors   Size Type\n/dev/sda1       2048  450562047  450560000 214.9G Linux filesystem\n/dev/sda2  450562048 1578741759 1128179712   538G Linux filesystem\n\nWhen you do that, what does it say about your USB drive?  What is the Type column?\nFigure out which is your removable drive, it is likely to be /dev/sdc or such\nsudo /sbin/fdisk /dev/sdc\n\nThat opens a text based interface, run \"p\" to see what partitions there are (probably only one now). Type \"d\" to delete that. THen \"n\" to start process of creating new partition table.  It is not unusual to allow one partition to consume whole USB stick.\nI recognize that most of the time, USB are formatted with a lowest common denominator file system like FAT32 because people to back and forth to Windows or other systems, you can try that.\n", "Q: Diablo 3 adding commands Okey so I got the battle.net launcher to work and even Diablo 3 to launch.

When I logged in using Windows 7 and the official Cisco client it prompted me not once but TWICE for an RSA passcode. The second time I was specifically prompted for the NEXT passcode. Short term work-around then is to log in once from a Windows box at the remote side each time you change your Windows password.

The user interface usually stays set to English and I switch the spell-check to the appropriate language. To this end, I went to \"Language Support\" in Ubuntu's system settings and installed all the required languages.\nThis works great, except for one annoyance. Every single variant of the languages I chose appear in the list when I want to switch languages! For instance, there are like half a dozen English variants: Australia, Canada, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States. The same is true for Dutch, French or German, and Spanish is even worse. This seems to happen everywhere I can choose a language for spell-check: Firefox, gedit, Libre Office, etc. Kind of cumbersome when I have to scroll through that LONG list several times a day!\nHow could I possibly limit the number of language variants in those lists? I usually only need one variant for each language: United States for English, Flemish for Dutch, Belgian for French, Spain for Spanish, etc.\nThanks for your input.\n\nA: This is not a solution, but an attempt to bring some light on the topic.\nThere does not exist as many dictionaries for spellchecking as the number of options showed. If you for example run the command\nls /usr/share/hunspell\n\nyou see that the folder includes quite a few symlinks. Those symlinks have been installed by the various packages which install the dictionaries, and I suppose the reason is that the applications should be able to find a suitable dictionary based on the current locale (the value of the LANG variable).\nIt would be possible to limit the number of variants by deleting symlinks in the just mentioned folder and some other related folders. But it's indeed not a good idea, since they will be reinstalled next time respective package is updated.\nI don't think there is an easy solution to this issue.\n", "Q: I can't make Ubuntu ask for a password anymore!

And I also can't make Google Chrome stop asking my login keyring. Can someone help me?\n\nA: To stop Google Chrome asking for password do as follows:\nI think the simplest way is to set the password for the keyring to an empty password -- you will not be prompted for a password then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications -> Accessories -> Password and Encryption Keys\n\n*Right-click on the \"login\" keyring.

Open System Settings. click on User Accounts. click on Unlock(on top-right corner). Then toggle auto-login option. Then log-out and login again. See whether this is working according to auto-login option you set.\n", "Q: package manager odd behavior after ubuntu failed update wich included an nginx update So, yesterday I updated ubuntu and that included an nginx update, the process warned about diffs/changes to the default file under sites-available, I reviewed the changes and prepared a new file which included the updates and my personal settings, I noticed the default directory to store projects was now /var/www/html/ instead of /usr/share/nginx/html/ and I actually had been thinking about making that very same change myself so I agreed and included that change in my new default configuration file, which I saved to ~/Desktop temporarily, so I wouldn't interfere with the update process.\nAfter I was finished editing my new file I agreed to replace the existing one as asked by the update prompt/process.\nThe updating process continued only to state a failure a few seconds later, the error stated something about failed to decompress package, I thought it would be fixed by attempting to update the system again so I tried but the update manager stated \"there are no updates to install\" (needless to say I got a bit suspicious but well, I just restarted the OS as asked).\nAfter rebooting I backed up and replaced the default file with my newly created one and moved all contents of /usr/share/nginx/html/ to /var/www/html/\nOddly enough, going to localhost didn't work but going to any other project stored on subdirectories worked fine, so I didn't care too much for the moment.\nHere's where it gets interesting (well a bit interesting, at least).\nToday I installed a non related package and suddenly the package manager tried to include some nginx changes in the process by executing a script and failed to do so.\n\nNOTE: Here's a pastebin of the terminal's output (before and after the fix):\nhttp://pastebin.com/pYv7yKrz\n\nA: I noticed this line:\ncp: cannot stat `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html': No such file or directory`\nSo I figured maybe just adding the previous index.html file (located now on /var/www/html/) to the old path (/usr/share/nginx/html/) would help the script execute without throwing an exception, and it did work.\n\nhttp://localhost is working fine now.\n\n", "Q: How do I resolve the \"Diskfilter writes are not supported\" error?

This may be probably is a newbie question, but I've used Ubuntu before and haven't had issues.\nToday, I decided to put a linux OS on my HP Pavilion G6 laptop (Win8). Since I tried Ubuntu before, I decided to check out a new flavor and got myself Debian Wheezy, put it on a live DVD, made necessary changes to windows (partitioning, turned off fast-boot, turned on legacy), tried it, installed, and all worked pretty well. Determined that I want to stick with Ubuntu for now (sucker for eye candy), grabbed 14.10, made a DVD, and rebooted into the installer. I took the Debian partition, shrunk it, and told Ubuntu to do its thing. Installation seemed to be fine, and I allowed it to do updates from the web. Pressed the \"restart now\" button and...I can't find Ubuntu.\nIt's not in Grub that installed with Debian (although I saw ubuntu doing something with Grub during the install), and it's not obviously available through the default loader (just boots HP, no obvious questions/opportunity to switch OS's). Should I reinstall? All the files seem to be where I expected them to be, when I look for them in Debian. \nBoth Debian and Win8 still are booting and running happily.\nThe following are available under Grub (with Debian logo in background) after esc -> f9 -> notebook harddisk:\nDebian GNU Linux, Linux 3.2.0-4-AMD64\nDebian GNU Linux, Linux 3.2.0-4-AMD64 recovery mode\n4 different Memory Tests\nWindows Vista Loader <- This one gives an error and won't boot into win8\nWindows Vista Loader <- haven't tried this one yet [and why does it say vista?]\n\nTo get to Windows, I just don't touch anything and it boots happily. Haven't tried to load it from Grub.\nSystem Specs:\nHP Pavilion G6\nAMD A6 Vision\nWindows 8\nDebian Wheezy AMD 64 (latest stable)\nUbuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn AMD 64 (Just got it today, so should be latest)\n\nIs there (another) Grub somewhere that I'm missing? Can I manually add Ubuntu to the Grub loader that is running for Debian?\n\nA: GRUB is made up of two parts, a small bootloader that goes into the boot loader (probably MBR, but don't know for sure with your system), and another section with the menu that goes into the system's /boot/grub directory.  The bootloader must know where the other section is located.\nSo, you have two grub menus:  one in your Debian installation (which is the one being used), and one in the Ubuntu installation, which is not being used.\nYou need to tell the bootloader which one to use, and most likely when you installed Ubuntu, you told it to load the bootloader into the Ubuntu partition rather than the MBR.  But there is a way to fix it.  update-grub won't do it; all that does is to update the menu in /boot/grub to configure any changes made to configuration files.  What you need to run is grub-install. The easiest way to do this is to boot from any system other than Ubuntu that uses the same version of GRUB, such as the Ubuntu installation CD/USB, then mount the Ubuntu partition.\nFor example, say you mount the disk to the directory /mnt (assume /dev/sda for this example... sudo mount /mnt /dev/sda???, where ??? is the partition containing Ubuntu).  Once you do this, the command would be: \nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nYou should not need to run update-grub, as the menu should be OK once it's actually read.  \nEdit after comment\nIt may be that the option --root-directory has been made obsolescent; I'm pretty sure I've used it with this version, but it is not listed in the man pages anymore.  [This article]((http://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/grub-reinstall.htm) shows its usage with a lot more details.\nI believe the current syntax may be sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda, but I haven't tried this myself; an example is shown if you use info grub-install.  The \"--boot-directory\" option specifies the full path to the boot directory, which is actually more clear; the old version assumed that you would use a directory named \"boot\" in the specified root directory, which is the default, but not necessarily what is wanted.\nDo you have a directory /media/ubuntu/long_hashed_looking_string/boot/grub/i386-pc?  That's where modinfo.sh is on my system.  The \"--boot-directory\" option actually is specifying where the grub.cfg file resides, which is what the grub bootloader looks for to display the menu.\nI actually meant to mount using the mount command, such as sudo mount dev dir, eg sudo mount /dev/sda?? /mnt.  It's quick and easy to find, although it will hide any other files under /mnt, so I usually have something like /mnt/temp for things like this.\n", "Q: Do you need to verify torrented ISO? I torrented the ISO and was wondering whether or not I needed to verify the ISO, for security purposes. \nHow secure are torrent downloads, in relation to file integrity?\nI'm using rTorrent if that matters.\n\nA: Yes, you do need to check the ISO using a checksum that is verified by the GPG file. \nThe torrented ISO is most likely the file the torrent was intended for you to download.

My question is this: will this profile also protect evince-gtk?\n\nA: The evince-gtk package installs its executable as /usr/bin/evince, so assuming the AppArmor profile is written conventionally, I think the answer you're looking for is yes.\nJust to be clear, though, AppArmor isn't protecting evince.

Is there any terminal application that can draw over a section of the terminal/take up some space, and show an editable notes section?\nI don't want to run screen in screen :-p\n\nA: Maybe not what you're looking for exactly, but I have a script to add a string to the beginning of the bash prompt.

Now the window just reads installing for i386-pc platform, and the orange bar just keeps going back and forth. It really seems like there is no progress whatsoever. I'm going to let it run for more time, but I was wondering what I could do to fix this problem and finally install my windows.iso onto my flash drive using Winsub. \n\nA: This is strange. I suggest you apply the 512 error fix. Maybe you have an UEFI PC and GRUB is struggling to determine what kind of bootloader to install on USB. Adding the target argument will force the installation of a MBR bootloader.\n\n512 error fix\nYou must edit the winusb script which is located probably in /usr/bin (I don't have it installed so I can't tell). Open it with any text editor with root permissions (e.g. gksu gedit /usr/bin/winusb). Now search for grub-install in that file (it may be on line 401) and change that line so it looks like this:\ngrub-install --target=i386-pc --boot-directory=\"$partitionMountPath/boot\" \"$device\"\n\nSave the script.

In fact the answer is yes in both cases. During install: see this question, if you'd like to partition prior to running the installer, take a look at a live CD/USB stick like SystemRescueCD.\nRegarding the data partition: since Windows can't (by default) read Linux Ext4 partitions, it's better to use NTFS (or FAT32) for it.

I'd advise to move away from that distro since you have such low specs and move toward Lubuntu or Xubuntu. The problem occurs because you have such low RAM and Unity is a RAM hog. I don't think your problem will be solved if you move to a 32-bit version. You can change this from your current image by using instructions provided on this older post or you can re-install Ubuntu if don't have anything worth saving on that partition.\nHere is a page which shows the memory usage of the different Linux Desktop environments.\n\nJust tell me what the \"lightest\" desktop environment is!\n  OK, for those of you who just want the final answer, with none of the explaination, here it is:\n| Desktop Environment  | Memory Used |\n| Enlightenment 0.18.8 |    83.8 MiB |\n| LXDE 0.5.5           |    87.0 MiB |\n| XFCE 4.10.2          |   110.0 MiB |\n| LXQt 0.7.0           |   113.0 MiB |\n| MATE 1.8.1           |   123.0 MiB |\n| Cinnamon 2.2.13      |   176.3 MiB |\n| GNOME3 3.12.2        |   245.3 MiB |\n| KDE 4.13.1           |   302.6 MiB |\n| Unity 7.2.0.14       |   312.5 MiB |\n\n\nA: Installing Lubuntu (http://lubuntu.net/) or Xubuntu (http://xubuntu.org/) instead of Ubuntu will reduce the amount of memory consumed. Neither of them use as much RAM as the Unity desktop which comes w/ \"regular\" Ubuntu.\nIf you can install more RAM I would do that, as well.\n\nA: The short answer to your question : changing to 32-bit version of Ubuntu should not make any difference in performance, because Ubuntu overall (32 or 64 bit) is perhaps one of the most resource-demanding Linux distros; it's just build that way, but there are methods to improve its performance.\nMy Experience\nI'm also running 64 bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 on a laptop with 6GB of RAM and single-core CPU, and on average I've got 2 GB to 3.3 GB of RAM usage (which I regularly check with htop and free -h commands), and that's with either Cinnamon or Unity desktops, and with various tune-ups on the software side done. Is there anything special I do? Nope; in a typical everyday session I have just couple firefox tabs and terminal open - that's all. On another laptop (2 GB RAM, two-core CPU) I have Linux Mint 17 (Qiana),also 64-bit ; and it also uses up 2 GB of RAM on average, plus swap memory ( which is kind of \"borrowed\" from hard-drive space, and hard drive isn't that fast).  As you may know, Linux Mint is derived from Ubuntu and \"under the hood\" they're not that different. So you can see that Ubuntu's memory usage is quite large. I'm going to share with you what I've learned so far and what I've done so far to tune the performance.\nThe Hardware Side of the Issue\nThe best improvement to any computer and any OS is in the hardware - more RAM, better CPU, and switching to a solid-state drive(ssd) are always good ways to improve performance. You might not realize it, but everything you do on a computer is read-write operation, whether it's in RAM or your drive, and with read/write operations speed solid state drives win a lot. Plus considering that their price is going down now, its a worthwhile investment. I've experimented with a chromebook (which as you may know has 16 GB SSD in the cheapest version). The speed was quite decent, considering that I was using 32 bit version of the OS and on a such crammed-down hard-drive, and nope, that wasn't Ubuntu in crouton, that was an install to the ssd itself.\nWell known performance boosters\nMany of these are found everywhere online, in fact I've first learned them form howtogeek.com article.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove unnecessary start-up applications. First , show all hidden applications. To do that type in terminal sudo sed -i ‘s/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g’ /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop. Now,type in dash Startup and open Startup Applications app. No printer or scanner ? Get rid of those on startup. No bluetooth ? Get rid of that,too. Chat can be disabled safely. I keep Files disabled,too (I use different file manager anyway). Don't need Onboard (on-screen keyboard) ? Well, you get the idea . . . .\n\n*Disable services with BootUp-Manager (sudo apt-get install bum). Becareful though - it's a serious tool, not a toy.\n\n*If you go to Windows only rarely, and want to boot into Ubuntu first thing in the morning, you want to change GRUB_TIMEOUT line in /etc/default/grub file to be GRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\n*Change how aggressively Ubuntu sends stuff into swap (borrowed) memory, by changing swappiness value. Simply add vm.swappiness = 5 line to /etc/sysctl.conf file.\n\n*Try using lighter desktop, like LXDE or XFCE.\n\n\nTune the Graphics\nThe big improvement to your experience with Ubuntu will come from tuning down the graphic effects. Many people suggest switching to lighter desktop environment, like Enlightenment , LXDE , or XFCE (and by the way, instructions for installing them you can find at What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?) . But if you like the default desktop environment, you may want to download CompizConfig Settings Manager (available through Software Center or by typing in terminal sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager). Once you got it, uncheck \"copy to texture\", choose fast texture filter under OpenGL, and uncheck all effects. See the screenshots of my ccsm configuration bellow. Try experimenting with the settings, of course, but remember that this is a serious tool - you can break something with it, so use caution. IMHO, this is the best tool you can use to improve your experience with Ubuntu's default Unity desktop environment if your RAM or graphics card isn't that great.\n\n\n\nTweak the /etc/fstab file\nRemember I've mentioned that everything is a read-write operation as far as a computer is concerned ? Linux updates information about when a file was accessed, even if a file was accessed only for reading; that means the system makes an unnecessary write to disk. What if you'd want to minimize unnecessary writes ? Sounds like a reasonable thing, especially in SSD - the less writes, the longer it lives. \nTo do that, add noatime,reatime words to your /etc/fstab file, in the line with configuration for your hard drive. Example is bellow (Note that in SSD drive, only noatime is needed,for more info read Arch Wiki):\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n# / was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=blahblahblahblah-blablah /               ext4    relatime,noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1 \n\nThere's another hack to /etc/fstab file that I understand somewhat less, but in a nut shell is supposed to improve shared memory (and improving memory is a good thing, always). I've found it on CyberCiti blog. Basically, you'd add a line none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,size=5G 0 0 and execute mount -o remount /dev/shm . Now , 5G is perhaps too much. On average my shared memory doesn't rise beyond 1M , so I'd say make it 1G or 500M. \nRemove some unnecessary init scripts\nUbuntu at boot runs a set of scripts, that start services like network manager or bluetooth.  This whole idea of init scripts may be a bit technica, but in a nutshell there's /etc/init and bunch of /etc/rc*.d folders, where * is a number. Almost all the time, ubuntu session uses stuff in '/etc/init' and  /etc/rc2.d folders. \nYou might not want to start some services/scripts at all. For instance, bluetooth, or brltty, which is an accessibility feature for visually impaired. What I did is to comment out the start on command in /etc/init/bluetooth.conf like so\n# bluez - bluetooth daemon\n\ndescription     \"bluetooth daemon\"\n\n# start on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\n\nenv UART_CONF=/etc/bluetooth/uart\nenv RFCOMM_CONF=/etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf\n\nWith brltty.conf, I believe i completely removed any traces of that program and the config file. How about scanner script (S20saned) in /etc/rc2.d/ ? Well, you can rename it by using mv /etc/rc2.d/S20saned  /etc/rc2.d/K20saned  . \nIn fact, that's the same thing that can be done through BootUp-Manager or Startup applications, only in command line.\nLimit number of processes for a user\nI've actually learned this off CyberCiti's article on \"fork bomb\".\nBasic idea is to prevent a user from running to many processes, thus limiting the amount of memory a session eats-up.\nSimply edit /etc/security/limits.conf file as such\nsomeuser hard nproc 500\n\nThe article doesn't say what number would be reasonable, so its up to you to figure this out.\nOther small ideas\n\n\n*\n\n*tweak configurations and appearance with Unity Tweak Tool\n\n*Use dconf and gconf editors to alter system settings. \n\n*Removing unnecessary apps to free up disk space (self explanatory, right ?)\n\n*Try switching to HTML 5 rather than flash. On my laptop, in full screen youtube is painfully glitchy. Sure, my graphics card ain't that good, but hey, it works with HTML 5 so much much better, lag is much rare-er.\n\n*Clean cache regularly; Use BleachBit to clean everything up.\n\n*Get laptop enough air-flow by raising it, or using higher battery, or cooling stands (pretty cheap on amazon). Basically, avoid overheating\n\n*Get faster network adapter\n\n*avoid gaphically demanding apps. These days I'm writing much stuff in nano command line text editor - rarely go to OpenOffice.\n\n*check if your laptop is detecting all CPU cores, by using lscpu commands, and reading line Core(s) per socket. If it gives something other than what you supposed to have, you have a problem. There are patches for that, amd-microcode and for intel-microcode\n\n*read logs from /var/log folder, specifically dmesg and syslog. \n\n*try different desktop manager, like gdm\n\n*investigate running services with 'initctl list'\n\n*investigate which processes take lost of memory by using htop, ps aux, and top.\n\n\nConclusion \nI've tried listing some of the tweaks I've done with my Ubuntu, but as I tend to do, I probably forgot something and might return to add details. Let me know if any of this is too technical and I'll try to explain in more simple terms. To other users - please let me know if I should add something or edit something. Cheerios!\n\nA: You have the required amount of memory for Ubuntu; it's not clear what RubyMine requires - it says 2 GB, but is that system memory or additional?  If it were system memory, it should specify the amount for each system, so it may be that this hog requires 2 GB in addition to the system memory.  \nHave you checked your memory (at the GRUB menu is a good place; let it run at least one full cycle). Since you're having a few other problems, there could be a problem with your memory.  FWIW, I have had crashes with Chrome on multiple systems, which is the one of the reasons I use Firefox.\nRubyMine is not supported here on AskUbuntu, but I've seen references to increasing memory doing a Google search.  Doesn't it have a indicator telling you how much memory it's using vs how much is available?  If that is marginal, it would be a problem; otherwise, it should not be.\n\nA: I can recommend you installing Linux from Windows OS with \"YUMI for Ubuntu Linux\".\nIf you have USB you can make it bootable and install from Multiboot USB Creator.\nThere you have many distros available e.g lubuntu if you need lightweight distribution.\nThere are even small distros that take up less than 150MB.\nIt is good also to check on what distros RubyMine can work. On Ubuntu it should be compatible with no problems installing.\n", "Q: Can not update or install package ubuntu While trying to install any update from update manager or Terminal OR install package from software center or Terminal I get this error.

So I figured my first step in trying to fix this would be figuring out my mail server :D any other suggestions are welcome.\nI searched over google but have came up empty and its about time I tried this site.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can see which packages are installed on your system using the dpkg -l command. If you combine it with the grep tool to search for specific words (e.g. mail) you can find out which packages with mail in their name are installed. Look for lines that start with i (for \"installed\"). For example:\n$ dpkg -l |grep mail\nii  bsd-mailx       8.1.2-0.20131005cvs-1       amd64        simple mail user agent\nii  libmail-sml     0.79.16-1                   all          Send email from a perl script\nii  libphp-phi      5.1-1                       all          full featured email transfer class for PHP\nii  lockfile-g      0.1.17                      amd64        Programs for locking and unlocking files and mailboxes\nii  mime-supp       3.54ubuntu1                 all          MIME files 'mime.types' & 'mailcap', and support programs\nii  postfix         2.11.0-1                    amd64        High-performance mail transport agent\n\nshows that I have the PostFix mail server installed.

My HDD is 1TB Gigabyte F2A55M-DS2. How can I partition my hard drive in a better way. \n\nA: The best way to prepare hard drive for dual boot is to have one partition for Windows and one partition for Ubuntu. Forget about obsolete advices of having separate /home partition, separate D: partition for data etc. Such approach causes more trouble than benefit.\nIn your setup, the easiest and most fault-proof method would be to do fresh installation of Windows 7 on whole drive and then install Ubuntu and let the installer shrink the Windows 7 partition. Ubuntu installer have option of install alongside Windows 7 and does it pretty well.\nIf You need more details, please read Dual Boot Partitions article in official Ubuntu documentation.\nPS\nKeep in mind, that Windows 7 by default also creates hidden, small (100MB) partition in the beginning of the drive. Ubuntu will also need additional partition for swap area. This is nothing to worry about. Just install Windows 7 on whole drive, and then let Ubuntu installer automatically do the rest.\n", "Q: Rezising Linux Partition which contains the ubuntu OS in 14.04 LTS I was trying to extend my / partition using ubuntu live cd after installation done before 6 months. For installing a software i needed 9GB more space in my root partition. The size of the root partition was 24gb only. To find a safe solution i used my virtual box OS, and after booting from ubuntu installation disk and extending the root partition using GParted worked like a charm. So I chosen to take the risk for my ubuntu 14.04 LTS version which is my host. After booting to a live ubuntu 14.04 cd I was able to delete an ntfs partition which was above my / partition for ubuntu. the resizing of my 24gb space to 61gb also didnt gave any error. But when i rebooted it ended up with a grub rescue menu. I tried to find a solution but nothing worked at all. \nI did this one also: \nsudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt\nsudo mount -o bind /dev/ /mnt/dev\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\n# Now within the chroot\nsudo update-grub\nexit\n\n# Now outside chroot\nThis also didnt helped. Pls help. \n\n\n\n\nA: You should realize that partitions can be safely expanded only to the right side (i.e bottom part). Any attempt to resize it to the left firstly should have consumed a lot of time and secondly and inevitably destroy the grub. Instead of chrooting and installing the grub, i can suggest you a simpler method.\nLive boot and open you /dev/sda7 partition in the file manager. Then, close it and open terminal and type the command.\nsudo /media/ubuntu/disk-uuid/usr/sbin/grub-install /dev/sda --boot-directory=/media/ubuntu/disk-uuid/boot/\n\nYou don't need to do update-grub as your grub config files are already in the boot directory.\nP.S- Note that you need to hit the tab key to get the uuid and then continue. I hope you know the right use of tab key before you proceed.\n", "Q: What's the difference between OptionSelector and ItemSelector? When writing an app for Ubuntu, it seems I can interchangeably use the ItemSelector or OptionSelector components.\nIn which situation should I use each one of those? What's their main difference that grants for two separate components?\n\nA: After having a chat with designers and SDK developers, it seems that the plan moving forward is to deprecate OptionSelector, and in general embedding UbuntuShapes in controls. \nI understand that there is no particular reason for having both components, as they have overlapping functionality. So the recommendation is to use ItemSelector for now.\n", "Q: Ubuntu crash - how to read log files A few days ago the laptop decided to close without no relevant reason.

However, at some point, a core went over 98°C, so I stopped the process. I tried to run clamscan again in verbose mode to see if there was an error with specific files. At some point, a core temperature goes over 90°C, but this time the desktop goes off and then the computer stops. Also, I wasn't able to restart it for a while (until it is cooled down again I think).\nSo, I think the problem is related with high cores temperature. Surely, clamscan freezes my laptop 3 times on 4 (and the only one it doesn't freeze it's because I manually force the process stop).\nFor the previous crashes, maybe some process at a certain point starts to warm the cores; however, I don't know what process.\nFWIW, these are the log files filtered for the time of the event crash.\nsyslog kern.log\nThe strange pattern happened again.\nAny suggest? \n\nA: Try:\n$ sudo service whoopsie restart\n\nIf it doesn't work, search error with:\nsystemctl | grep -i whoopsie\n\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep -i error (or failure)\n\nand show us what's appears.\nOr remove the whoopsie package completely:\n$ sudo apt-get purge whoopsie\n\nThe whoopsie package will now be removed from the system.\n", "Q: Which version of GIMP should I install?

So you type partial of commands and by hitting Tab we get a auto completion of commands.\nInstallation\nStep 1: Install bash-completion\n$ sudo apt-get install bash-completion\n\nAnd some times it works if we re-installed it by the follwing command:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall bash-completion\n\nStep 2: Enable bash-completion in your .bashrc file\nOpen your gedit ~/.bashrc and if these content doesn't exist there, add them at the end of it and save it.\n# enable bash completion in interactive shells\nif ! shopt -oq posix; then\n  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then\n    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\n  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then\n    . /etc/bash_completion\n  fi\nfi\n\nImportant: After changing the file you need to source your  ~/.bashrc with source ~/.bashrc or reopen your Terminal. It should be fixed now.\n\nA: You may also be in a shell that doesn't support auto complete (ex: Bourne Shell | SH). If you want BASH auto complete you need to switch shells, say to BASH (Bourne Again SHell) instead with the command \nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nSource: Ubuntu Wiki - Changing Shells\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.014 not detecting my ASUS Zenfone 5 I want to connect my ASUS Zenfone 5 to an Ubuntu OS but the system is not detecting it.

And now on boot up there's a wolf on the screen and says 'Ubuntu Kylin' and my touchpad doesn't work. How do I fix these issues?\nI upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 just an hour ago. I configured the update manager to show only LTS updates. Then I did \"sudo apt-get install update-manager-core\" followed by \"sudo do-release-upgrade -d\".

I am used to storing the OS and drivers on C: and Data and Programms on D: from windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I sort of combine them and mount them both under the system root?\n\n*How can I tell a package to install to dev/sdb not dev/sda using \nthe PackageStore, Synaptic or apt-get?\n\n*Is there a way to tell the system to use both devices acording to the required volume with a higher priority on the SSD without the need to manually mount them?\n\n\nThank you! :)\n\nA: Packages are being installed rather in proper directories/paths, not on disks as such - better to leave Windows thinking style aside. \nWhat counts here is the directory tree - starting from / - aka root filesystem, and then, for example:\n/boot\n/bin\n/sbin\n/home\n/var\n/tmp\n/root\netc.\nThose can be just directories or mountpoints - where other disks can be mounted to.\nFrom logical point of view then you'll see for example still the same /home, but instead of your SSD disk, it can be located on HDD disk.\nYou can install system on SSD disk and use the other, disk mounted under some mountpoint in your directory tree - for example /storage - to keep your stuff there. Whatever you prefer.\nIt doesn't even need to be the whole disk under /storage - depends on how you want to partition your disk.\nAgain - for example: /dev/sdb1 (first partition of your HDD disk, let's say) may be /storage, and /dev/sdb2 (the other partition - of whatever side) can be i.e. /home\nIf you have something on your hdd disk, that you'd like to keep - you, most likely, don't even need to format it - just specify the proper filesystem type in mount command.\nMight be worth also to have a look at /etc/fstab if you want to mount the other disk automatically on startup.\nJust anyway be sure also that you don't use as a mountpoint a folder with some stuff in it - after you mount another partition/disk to it, whatever was in the mountpoint directory will be inaccessible - until you unmount the disk again.\nIt may look a bit twisted, but it's not that difficult after all. But the topic is anyway a bit more complex than one could expect.\nAll depends on what you would exactly like to do.\n", "Q: Bash Files - /etc/profile vs ~/.bash_profile file Does anyone know what the difference between the /etc/profile and the ~/.bash_profile file is? Which one is executed first?\n\nA:    When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-inter‐\n   active  shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes com‐\n   mands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.   After  reading\n   that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,\n   in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one  that\n   exists  and  is  readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the\n   shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\n\nThis was taken verbatim from man bash. Man is your friend :)\n", "Q: Office 2007 problems I just installed Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit on a desktop pc. \nHowever, I HATE libreoffice and had trouble with open office. I want to install Office 2007 enterprise. Every time I try to install it, Wine says that it encountered a serious error and needs to close. So, I put in a 32-bit wineprefix. Then, it kept saying \"EnterpriserWWW/osetup.dll does not validate or is not present\". So, I tried Playonlinux, and I kept getting the same error. How to I install office 2007 on my computer without these errors. I have wine 1.6.\nI know it will work in some way because there are people who have done it, and I flawlessly installed it on a 32-bit Ubuntu pc.\n\nA: According to Wine MS Office 2007 was tested for installation only - you may check there to see if there's something you're missing on that installation.  I note also that office 2010 and 2013 do not perform well under wine.\nTwo alternatives would be to use the online versions of office (which would be the 2013 version, but not Office 365) or to install Windows in a virtual machine, and run Office 2007 from there.\n\nA: You might try WPS Office (http://www.wps.com) which has a UI similar to MS Office.  They have a Linux version; it is currently in alpha, but it seems to be quite polished.\n", "Q: How to permanently change floppy rights? I installed Lubuntu 14.04 on an old computer, and I'm trying to use its floppy drive, since it's the fastest way to move small files from it to my other computers.\nI'm having troubles, though, since apparently only root has the rights to work with it; with my normal user rights I can only see the files, not edit them, as you see in this screenshot:\n\nOf course I can copy files on the floppy from the terminal, by writing things like sudo cp -file's directory- /media/floppy0, but that's a pain.\nSo my plan is to become, at least temporarily, owner of the floppy drive, so that I can change, hopefully definitively, the rights. I looked for solutions all over the web, here and on other websites, without success. \nFor example I tried to write sudo chown alex:alex /media/floppy0, but it says I don't have the permission for that. I tried sudo chown -R alex:alex /media/floppy0, which worked only one time, and just temporarily (since it all returned as it was before after I mounted the floppy again); now it says I don't have permission for that anymore.\nI also modified some files, without success too. Here they are.\nIn /etc/fstab I've added the last two lines. The last one now has a # before it, because I was experimenting with it, without success of course. I read that I had to do this on an other website. I'm not sure I can link it.\nalex@Ermac:~$ cat /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Here I added the last line, as I read on the same website as before. I tried by writing both \"floppy\" and \"floppy0\". Neither of these solutions worked.\nalex@Ermac:~$ cat /etc/modules\n# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.\n#\n# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded\n# at boot time, one per line.

Those two 0s where 1s:\nalex@Ermac:~$ cat /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules\n...\n# PC floppy drives\n#\nKERNEL==\"fd*\", ENV{ID_DRIVE_FLOPPY}=\"0\"\n\n# USB floppy drives\n#\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{bInterfaceClass}==\"08\", ATTRS{bInterfaceSubClass}==\"04\", ENV{ID_DRIVE_FLOPPY}=\"0\"\n...\n\nSo... any other idea? :\\\n\nA: So this was solved thanks to Rmano: I had to add uid=<my user id> to the list of options in /etc/fstab. So, the final line becomes:\n/dev/fd0 /media/floppy0 auto rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8,uid=<my user id> 0 0\n\n", "Q: FTP refuses any and all connections (vsftpd) Even on localhost using the ftp command, through the web server on WordPress, on my personal computer through FileZilla, in short, I need my FTP server but it refuses to let anyone connect.\nUsing SFTP works perfectly, but even when I enable SSL on vsftpd which I think is the same thing, it still doesn't work.\nI've followed many tutorials on how to set it up, tried wiping my server multiple times, nothing works.\nUsing netstat -tlpn returns this result, it seems the process is running but is not listening, even though in the config file listen is set to YES.\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      9563/mysqld     \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      972/sshd        \ntcp6       0      0 :::58623                :::*                    LISTEN      25429/java      \ntcp6       0      0 :::49505                :::*                    LISTEN      25429/java      \ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      22955/apache2   \ntcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      25429/java      \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      972/sshd\n\n\nA: The vsftpd service is not running and hence is not listening on port 21 or any preconfigured port. As a result you are getting the connect: connection refused error message every time while using an FTP client to connect to the server. I think you should check the setup procedure and configuration files for sorting out the issues. This and this might be a very good place to start.\n\nA: This actually turned out to be that SSH SFTP was somehow running on 21 instead of 22. So, if anyone is having the same issue, trying connecting through an SFTP client instead of plain old FTP, still using port 21\n\nA: Check your vsftpd.conf file for duplicate entries.\nIf there's two times the same thing, it would simply not start correctly.\nCheck:\n/etc/vsftpd.conf\n\nfor lines that are properties entries that are duplicated.\n", "Q: I can't install it from flash drive I made a working flash drive to boot ubuntu from ( I've used it in another computer and it worked) and I can't install it on my laptop.\nWhen I restart de laptop with the flash drive in, I just get a beep from the laptop and I can't select any option from the ubuntu installation menu that appears.\nIs it some mistake in my hard drive? how can I solve it?\nThanks\n\nA: Check your laptop BIOS to make sure it will allow you to boot from a flash drive.

When upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 14.10 via wifi (this is not a mistake, some modern computers come only with wifi), the connection was interrupted and reconnected within 1 second after downloading ca. 2.2 of 2.5 GB. \nThe release upgrader shows a dialog that says something like \"Updates could not be downloaded. The system upgrade was aborted\". I am again connected to the internet. The dialog has a \"close\" button which will delete all downloaded files.\nHow do I resume the downloading of the upgrade packages where it stopped, or when starting from scratch, how do I preserve the already downloaded files? \n(Note: This is the second time this happens at exactly the same progress step.)\n\nA: The problem was based on a misunderstanding. A previous upgrade failed because it predicted the not enough diskspace, and ubuntu-release-upgrader nudged me to do sudo apt-get clean which to make free space, which basically cleared all downloaded upgrade files.\nI now found out that ubuntu-release-upgrader preserves downloaded packages. It is only confusing that the user has to close and restart the upgrader application and watch how it downloads again package lists (or something like that). After that, it continues downloading only the missing packages (like for me packages #2000–2550).\n", "Q: Can't find \"Background\" in System Settings Recently I upgraded to 14.10 and afterwards I experienced some problems but slowly I managed to solve most of them.

Both of these apps will allow you to set desktop wallpaper settings like scale, center, stretch, etc, and will override the settings in System Settings > Appearance. \nubuntu-tweak, as suggested by tigerjack89, is also a viable option (and makes managing other aspects like theme, login settings, etc, much easier with its GUI). \nI do understand the concern of the Appearance section not even being listed, but unfortunately dont have an answer (never switched out for Gnome).

Otherwise, the closer to the end you clicked, the slower it'd go, trying to run in 5 seconds a smaller distance.\nThe y option was changed to the pelicanSprite.y instead of simply y, too, making it work properly.\n", "Q: How can I log in to the GUI to start deploying services? I installed Juju agent locally and installed the juju gui as well locally.\nI'm trying to see where can I log in to the GUI from but it doesn't say...\nHow can I log in to the GUI to start deploying services?\n\nA: To find the ip/hostname of the GUI you first must run juju status in the command line and it will output the list of services which have been deployed to the active environment. Visit this path and then the GUI will tell you where to look for the password. \nIf you do this on a remote cloud you will need to run juju expose juju-gui to first expose it to the world. This is not required when deploying to your local machine.\nIf you deployed it locally the password will likely be available by running head ~/.juju/environments/local.env\nYou should also take a look at the juju-quickstart plugin which can handle setting up the environment, deploying the GUI, and then opening up the browser and logging you in.\n\nA: You should be able to point your browser to http://IP juju-gui/. To figure out the IP just run juju status juju-gui and remember to open the port where juju-gui is running with juju expose juju-gui\nYou can find more details at https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/controllers-gui\n", "Q: note application that willsync with a android client ubuntu 14.10 hi just installed ubuntu 14.10 and very happy with it\ngot everything setup nicely but disappointed again everpad or nixnote wont work\nive tried the following that might have sync function \neverpad\nnixnote\nboth fail with authentication\ntomboy \nneeds webdav\ni also tried springseed which looks great and syns with dropbox but no android client \nall the sync clients look like they need ubuntu one which of course has gone\nive tried nixnote 2 beta which i can do a force to intall because it wont install because of libpoppler requirements and it runs but then package manger realises it is broke and keeps removing it! \nany solutions available apart from using the evernote webclient ...\n\nA: You can use Google Keep - it can be used to write notes, do lists and take photos.\nIt has a App for android, which can be used offline, and  includes a widget:\n  \nYou can then access it from Ubuntu and other computer using your Google Account:\n  \nIt also has a Google Chrome/Chromium app, which like the android app is usable offline, and syncs when online.\n  \n", "Q: How can I encrypt Deja-Dup backups with a GPG public key?

I was super pleased with how fast it ran so I decided to install it on my 8 year old netbook (I don't plan on dual booting with this, however). At first I accidentally used the x64 version and installed it on the 32 bit netbook. It was very slow then I realized I installed the wrong version. So, I downloaded the i386 iso 14.10 yesterday, burned it to a disk, tried to install it and the computer doesn't recognize the disk as bootable so it skips it and boots from the harddrive. I looked at the files in the x64 and they are pretty much the same except the i386 is missing the \"EFI\" folder and some things in the boot folder. I don't know if that makes a difference. If anyone knows what I'm doing wrong with the i386 version, please reply.\nThanks\n\nA: You can't install the 64-bit version on a 32-bit machine. It won't boot. If you did manage to install it, then the machine is 64-bit. However, as it's 8 years old, as you say, and a netbook, it will probably be quite slow, especially depending on how much RAM it has, and what graphics chipset it uses. If it's just slow due to the RAM, you may be able to use Xubuntu on it to get a faster system, as it is a lighter weight variation of Ubuntu, with a slightly different interface.\n", "Q: HDMI stops working with my new Acer aspire E3-112 I bourght a new Acer Aspire E3-112.

If you are the only administrator of this computer and you have not created this user, then it is likely someone else has gained control of your computer and is using it for nefarious purposes.\nAt the least disconnect the computer from the Internet. If it is connected by an Ethernet cable, unplug it.

The ctrl key is functionally most paired with the cmd key, even though in physical keyboard layout the cmd key will bind to super.\nSo my first step was simply swapping cmd and ctrl by editing xkb since that restores 70% of the functionality I'm missing.\nThat mostly leaves begin/end/delete and related Mac-\"control\" functionality, but I don't know a good way to split the functionality or move some super obscure key over to ctrl to achieve this.

In a comment here I've been told that unnecessarily using sudo should be avoided. While it wasn't needed in that particular case, I don't see any harm in using it.\nI think that when executing trivial programs like cat as root using sudo, the overall risk of hitting a bug that would somehow compromise system security is very low.\nSo can someone please point out the possible implications, besides typing 4 more characters and a space?\n\nA: Using sudo excessively is the Linux equivalent of the old Windows habit of running everything under the Administrator account. That one has been discussed and criticized to hell and back, so you can read everything that talks about why a person should not be running their Windows computer as an Administrator, and every single point will apply to habitual use of sudo on Linux.\n\nA: The risk of a typo is more than the risk of a bug.\nThe risk of gaining a habit of \"it doesn't work, stick sudo on it!\" is much higher than the risk of a bug.\nAs a sysadmin who's seen people execute all sorts of random commands with sudo that didn't need them, I always caution against superfluous usage of sudo.\nWhile cat isn't harmful, the habit that this encourages is.\n\nA: well, it's just cause you might accidentally mess with sensitive parts of your file system, causing much much trouble to yourself\nBeing careful is never enough, so better not to expose yourself to unnecessary dangers\n\nA: I think there is another issue not yet mentioned: sudo status is cached for the shell with a default of 15 minutes. This means you don't have to provide your password in the next 15 minutes in order to execute a potentially dangerous command.\nI think we all can think of more or less likely security issues that could result from that: Unknown software bugs that exploit this or forgetting to lock the screen with random people or co-workers around come to mind.\nThis is indeed my primary reason for not using sudo when I don't have to and even if I have to, for frequently closing shells after I'm done with sudo work.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with unnecessarily using Sudo. Sudo (in it's default configuration/purpose on Ubuntu) provides fully elevated privilidges. If a user has been granted those privilidges, they are his to exercise as he wishes (including unnecessarily!). However, using Sudo when it isn't needed raises the stakes. It's an unnecessary risk. A simple typo can become disasterous, and that is why most people avoid using elevated permissions when they aren't needed. However, just because it is common practice to avoid unnecessary Sudo usage, doesn't mean it's wrong to go a different way. \nSudo to your heart's content!\nWithin the context of AskUbuntu, I'm not at all surprised that you were instructed to avoid unnecessary Sudo usage. The purpose of this site is to allow experts to ask questions and get expert responses, but in reality there are lots of novice users on here, who know just enough to get themselves into trouble. It's common for posters to try and protect these users from themselves. Sudo abuse is common among novice users, because they don't really understand what is or does, nore take the time to learn. Also, this site prides itself on producing quality content. Unnecessary commands are inefficient, and therefore reduce the quality of a post. \n\nA: When you do anything with Sudo, it means you give full rights to it, that's root access which is sometimes become very risky, if inadvertently, an app, which is running with root permission could do something wrong, results in a system crash to the corruption of the OS. Anyhow, for Cat, it's fine with root.\n", "Q: Convert SVG to PDF on several sheets I have a SVG file created in Inkscape. I want to print it on multiple sheets to finally form a big poster.

For instance (typed on a terminal): \nconvert askUbuntu.pdf -crop 100%x50% +repage askUbuntuSplit.pdf\n\nYou can then split it into individual pdf files using:\npdftk filename.pdf burst\n\nI presume imagemagick and pdftk are already installed.\n\nA: Have you tried the pdfposter package?

This will happen regardless of the application I am in, and in a bad spell will occur every 30 seconds or so.  Through some research and suggestions from friends, I have tried to diagnose this as a driver issue.  I have an Nvidia GeForce 755m graphics card, which works fine with my Windows 8.1 configuration.  I have tried to download the proper drivers for my graphics card and there is always an error when I run the file. Here is the link for the driver I tried to download: http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/78469/en-us\nIs Nvidia supported in linux? Please let me know what I am doing wrong.\nThank you!\n\nA: nVidia Geforce 755m is a mobile chipset with nVidia Optimus technology. It is very well supported in Ubuntu. \nI have had some issues using the generic Nouveau drivers. I faced similar issues as you(i used to get black screen and that used to log me out forcefully. I would then login and just pray to install the nvidia drivers before the blackout occurs again. I was too naive to press ctrl+alt+f1 and install the drivers from the terminal). So i installed the Nvidia proprietary drivers from Ubuntu Repository and that resolved the black screen issues. \nInstead of downloading drivers from nvidia website you can do what i did. If you are on unity, go to unity dash and search for additional drivers. This will then list out the supported drivers for your card. You can then activate the proprietary and tested nvidia drivers. This should resolve your issue.\nThis would install a nVidia control panel from where you can switch between nVidia or intel chipset for graphics processing. There is also an ongoing Bumblebee Project which will allow you to dynamically switch between the chipsets. But this is a bit advanced tech for me. So i will leave it upto you to decide if you want to try out bumblebee or simply install the proprietary nVidia drivers.\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu from Ext SSD? I have downloaded Ubuntu (most recen version), and used image burner on .iso file to create another .iso file in my hard drive, but when I try and boot from my hard drive, it wont let me? \n\nA: Just copying over a .iso file to the external SSD wont work. Your external drive needs to be prepared for booting. By 'prepared' i mean, there are several things which happen behind the scenes to enable the drive to be used as a bootable device. First the contents are copied over to drive and then a bootloder is written to the MBR of the drive. We need not do all these things manually. There are several tools available to accomplish this task. For ex: Unetbootin or pendrive linux.\nBefore using these tools, just ensure to backup the data of your SDD as it might get erased.\n", "Q: Is there a PDF viewer that supports password protected files (username and password)? I need a pdf viewer that supports password protected files, I don't want to crack the files or anything like that I have the required information. The thing is that Document Viewer asks for a password when I try to open these files but does not ask for a username which is required to view the file, so even if I type the password the file won't open. When at work I can open the file using Adobe Reader but the Ubutnu version (Adobe REader 9) says that I need a plugin to use such functions.\nThanks\n\nA: I've been searching around a bit and I'm not finding that Adobe supports this type of encryption/password.\nAdobe's site says there are two levels of protection, both with just a password:\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/securing-pdfs-passwords.html\nWhat software is your company using to create these PDFs?  This might give us a lead on how they are doing it.  My guess is that it's not actually a PDF file but some sort of wrapper that encases the PDF file and then integrates with your company's active directory?\nEdit:  It looks like this company makes an Adobe supported plugin that is doing what you are describing:\nhttp://plugin.fileopen.com/faq.aspx\nIf it's not this company, it's likely someone similar.  Given that, you're going to have to find out if the company making this plugin you're using has a client app for Ubuntu/Linux.  The plugin (at least how these people have designed it) is interfacing to a server on your network (active directory?) and retrieving credentials.  It's a pretty custom solution; it's not likely a PDF reader is going to support this natively.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 Light Locker Password Not Working I was trying to install epsxe psx emulator for my desktop.

I finally decided to dual boot (I need windows for ONE program: ArcGIS). Everything was going fine until I took my laptop to class and realized my battery power was draining like crazy (1.5 hours remaining at the start of a 3 hour lecture). \nDue to this predicament, I decided to try out tlp. I followed a guide online on how to install tlp through the terminal and my Wifi stopped working.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: To disable wifi powersave in TLP permanently on battery you don't have to fiddle with iwconfig or rc.local (won't work reliable anyway). \nChange the following line in TLP's configuration instead:\nWIFI_PWR_ON_BAT=N \n\n\nA: There are several ways to permanently disable power management. The easiest is:\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Right above exit 0, add a new line:\niwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. If this is ineffective, for some reason, we'll try something else.\n\nA: I faced the same problem,\nI fixed my problem by\n\nUninstalling TLP and Installing Wireless Drivers\n\nCommand: (to remove tlp) (sorry I have OCD)\nsudo apt-get purge tlp\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get clean all\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nCommand: (to install 802.11 drivers) (I am on Kali rolling and using Wicd network manager)\nsudo apt-get install firmware-brcm80211 firmware-b43-installer firmware-b43legacy-installer broadcom-sta-dkms\n\nif you don't know the repository of Kali: ( Paste this in /etc/apt/souces.list and save )\ndeb http://repo.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free\n\nI also noticed, while installing tlp, the package arping was replaced by iputils-arping.

Try a DVD instead and make sure the file is the right size which I belive its 981MB so almost a GB. Then burn the DVD and try the process again. It is very similar to burn the DVD as it is with a CD. Any blank DVD's will work and doesn't cost that much at Walmart or Office Depot. Hope this helps you out \n", "Q: Ubuntu Screen shot File format Why the screenshots taken in UBUNTU systems cant be seen in windows systems ?\n ( I only tried in windows 7 )\nThe screenshot file format is .png\n\nA: The Screenshots are saved with a default name consisting of the current Date and Time. That String contains \":\" as a seperator for the timestamp, e.g. \"12:02:45\". \nUnfortunately, due to the technical limitations of windows, this conflicts with the use of things like C:\\ as a drive label. Therefore, any file name on Windows is not allowed to contain \":\", as well as several other characters (\"A filename cannot contain any of the following characters:\n\\ / : * ? \" < > |\" - Microsoft). Linux does not have any problems with this character though, which is why it is being used in the timestamp formatting.\nSo, if you rename your Screenshots to NOT include any of the characters mentioned above, you will be able to open/edit those on Windows too.\nUnfortunately, this default behavior of the screenshot utility is hardcoded, so you either have to enter a valid filename when saving (Being descriptive with filenames never hurts) or rename them afterwards (this can easily be scripted) if you need to access them from Windows.\n", "Q: Transferring data from one pc to another pc without using USB drive I have a desktop and a laptop computer and both have UBUNTU 14.04. I have bought the laptop a month ago. All of my data like movies, songs etc stored in the desktop. I want to move all of these data in my laptop without using any USB drive. Is there any way to do it by connecting them together??\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to transfer data between ubuntu laptops and desktops without USB. \n1) Install SSH in both laptop and desktop. \nsudo apt-get install ssh\n2)Connect to the network by navigating through network-manager applet on the top panel and choose “connection information”\n3) Connect to the target machine and move the folder. (Folder should have read and write permission). \n\nA: I assume you have Linux on both machines, with:\n\n\n*\n\n*identically named accounts\n\n*sshd running on the laptop\n\n*you are logged on to the desktop\n\n*all the files you want are in your home directory.\n\n*both machines connected via network\n\n\nTo transfer all the data, you can use rsync as mentioned by ApolloLV or just use a tar pipe to transfer your complete home dir:\ncd ~\ntar cf - . |ssh <IP_of_laptop> 'tar xvf -'\n\nWhen you log on to your laptop the next time, you should have all the data. (I would check to make sure before you dump the old machine, though. ;-))\n\nA: I suppose they're both connected to networks (wireless or wired) so just create a shared directory on target machine, map it from source machine and transfer your data.\nCheers,\nSilvia\n\nA: The utility you are looking for is called rsync. \nrsync is a file copying program that is able to do so over the internet, that can sync two PCs by just transferring file differences and that is able to continue aborted/failed file copying runs (if run with the correct flag). It is so useful I even use it when copying large amounts of data on one machine!\nIt uses a SSH connection, so you will have to setup this type of connection on both PCs. SSH is pretty easy to use if you stick with username/password security, but be aware that misconfiguration may pose a big security risk. If you don't plan to use that feature in the future (it really comes in handy when doing remote configuration), I would suggest disabling it afterwards.\n", "Q: password not accepted on ubuntu login page I am using a hp chromebook 14. When I go to the login page of ubuntu I correctly spell my user and password but it says incorrect login.  \nThis was working fine yesterday when I installed it but now I can't log in. I'm not sure how to change the password in chrome os terminal because I cant reach the terminal in ubuntu.  \nPlease send me the code I would need to type in chrome os terminal to solve this issue.  \n\nA: Just press Ctrl+Alt+F2 and try to login with no X.  You should login with root account. Then you could change the user password with command like this:\npasswd \nPress  Ctrl+Alt+F7 or something to get graphic back.\n\nA: restart and go to recovery mode for your os, see whether an option named root is there, if so choose it by navigating to root and press enter. then type passwd and enter. this will ask for your new UNIX password. for changing password of a specific user, you have to do passwd uid,where uid should be replaced with your username.\n", "Q: Printing Comment pages only with Acrobat How to print only the comment pages only in acrobat professional 7?\nI have found a suggestion in one of the web pages\nto use javascript to extract the comment pages only, \nbut I am unable to complete the script.\n- Use a JavaScript to scan the PDF \"this.syncAnnotScan\"\n- Then make a variable (i.e. \"a\" ) equal to zero and then increment it one for every page in the doent.\n- Make another variable (i.e. \"b\") equal to \"this.getAnnots\" using the first variable ( \"a\" ) as the \"nPage:\" value.\n- Set an \"IF\" statement checking if the second value ( \"b\") is not NULL then use \"this.print\" using the first variable ( \"a\") as both the \"nStart:\" and \"nEnd\" parameters.\n- Make sure that you have the preference set to print comments in the Acrobat Preferences.\n\nI have tried but unable to complete the script.\nKindly help me.\n\nA: I was looking for a solution of the same problem (printing only PDF pages with annotations) and I'm sharing the script here so others may benefit.\nSimply save the following as printAnnotatedPages.js and put it into the Javascript subfolder of the Adobe Acrobat installation:\n// Print only pages with annotations in them\nfunction printAnnotatedPages() {\n\n    // Sync document annotations\n    this.syncAnnotScan();\n\n    // Check if printRange is available (Acrobat 11 or newer)\n    var pagesRange = null;\n    if (typeof app.formsVersion != \"undefined\" && app.formsVersion >= 11.0)\n    {\n        // Enable printRange\n        pagesRange = [];\n    }\n\n    // Scan pages for annotations\n    var startPage = -1;\n    var new_set = false;\n    for (var page = 0; page < this.numPages; page++)\n    {\n        // Check whether the current page has annotations\n        var hasComments = this.getAnnots({nPage: page});\n        if (hasComments != null) {\n            // This page has annotations\n            // Check whether this is a new set\n            if (!new_set) {\n                // Start new set of pages\n                startPage = page;\n                new_set = true\n            }\n        } else {\n            // This page hasn't annotations\n            // Print the set of pages (if any)\n            if (new_set) {\n                new_set = false;\n                if (pagesRange != null) {\n                    // Add set of pages to print list\n                    pagesRange.push([startPage, (page-1)]);\n                } else {\n                    // Print this set (displays Print UI)\n                    this.print({nStart: startPage, nEnd: (page-1)});\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Final check\n    if (pagesRange != null) {\n        // Print the last set of pages (if any)\n        if (new_set) {\n            // Add the last set of pages to print list\n            new_set = false;\n            pagesRange.push([startPage, (page-1)]);\n        }\n\n        // Print using the range function\n        if (pagesRange.length > 0) {\n            var pp = this.getPrintParams();\n            pp.interactive = pp.constants.interactionLevel.full;\n            pp.printRange=pagesRange;\n            this.print(pp); \n        } else {\n            // No pages with annotations\n            app.alert({nIcon: 1, cTitle: \"Print annotated pages\",\n                cMsg: \"There are no annotated pages in this document.\"});\n        }   \n    } else {\n        // Print the last set (displays Print UI)\n        if (new_set) {\n            new_set = false;\n            this.print({nStart: startPage, nEnd: (page-1)});\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Add menu item to the File menu\napp.addMenuItem({ cName:\"PrintAnnotatedPages\", cUser:\"Print pages with annotations...\", cParent:\"File\",\n          cExec:\"printAnnotatedPages();\", cEnable: \"event.rc = (event.target != null);\", nPos: 16 });\n\nThis adds a new menu Print pages with annotations... under File in Acrobat when there is a document opened; I've tested it and works with v9 and DC successfully. With versions before 11 - due to missing API - you must confirm the print dialog before each group of pages, though.\n\nA: with Acrobat Reader XI, this creates the list with extra spaces, which subsequently does not print properly. That is, for the following:\n9 , 17 - 21 , 23 , 25 - 26 , 29 - 30 , 33 - 36 , 40 - 41 , 45 - 47 , 49 , 52 - 54 , 56 - 59 , 64 - 68 , 70 - 73 , 76 - 78 , 83 - 90 , 92 - 93 , 95 - 96 , 99 , 104 , 107 - 108 , 113 , 117 - 120 , 123 - 124 , 163 - 165 , 194 - 196 , 223 - 224 , 226 , 230 , 233 , 237 , 239 - 240\nOnly the first page prints.\nIf I manually remove the extra spaces:\n9, 17-21,\nIt works fine. Is it possible to adjust the script to remove the spaces? I think the ones directly after the comma are fine.\n", "Q: Firefox does not connect outside proxy while other browsers do Little background: I am behind a proxy, where we use \"automatic proxy config URL\" on http://webproxy.mycompany.com:8080\nDuring typing of this question I also tried Chromium browser which seems to be working.

I have UBUNTU 14.04 installed.\nWhat will happen if I install Windows 8.1 on a different partition?\nIs there any difference between installing WIN8.1 on a computer that has UBUNTU already installed and installing UBUNTU on a machine that has WIN8.1 already installed?\n\nA: Yes, definitely. \nRule of thumb: first Windows, then Linux.\nWindows installers take (almost) no care of existing operating systems on your machine. If you installed Ubuntu first and then ran the Windows 8.1 installer, its routines would just overwrite any boot manager (The one where you choose which OS to boot). Then you can choose to use Win8 on startup, but probably not Ubuntu. This is very difficult to fix, so don't try to do it that way!\nUbuntu on the other hand is very well aware of the fact that it is often just installed as a secondary OS, which is why it will even offer you to install it alongside windows during installation. This will setup your boot manager (grub in this case) to include any existing OSes even if you choose to do some manual partitioning. \nUsually this breaks the windows starter, but fixing that is easy: get the installation medium, boot it up, hit \"repair\" and you have a working dualboot environment.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Live: Disable Keyboard Shortcut Overlay on first boot I am working on an Ubuntu 14.04 Live system.\nOn every boot it displays the same \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" overlay that is shown when you press the Super key for two seconds.\n\nThis is a nice feature for a normal install, but I would like to disable it for the live system.\nI have tried running this in the chroot (used for creating the live system) and on startup (using /etc/rc.local) but it doesn't help.\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/shortcut-overlay false\n\nHow can I disable this overlay?\n\nA: After a lot of trying I figured out a way.\nMy final solution is adding the file /etc/profile.d/overlay.sh.

I cannot afford restarting all containers all the time when I add another one.\nIMO The most proper way of solving it is to redesign the /etc/init/lxc-net.conf upstart job, so it doesn't handle both lxc bridge and dnsmasq. \nThe problem would be fairly simple if dnsmasq was compatible with upstart in a sense that it could work with either expect daemon, expect fork or without any expect stanza.\ndnsmasq provides a way of giving the pid of its process - if only there was a way to forward this information to upstart...\nFor the record, the init script for the dnsmasq package itself is not ported to upstart yet.\n\nA: You can use the Upstart job and shell scripts in this repository: https://github.com/CameronNemo/lxc-net.\nTo restart dnsmasq without tearing down the bridge, simply use the restart command (do not use stop then start, that will tear down the bridge).\nNote that you will need to migrate your configs from /etc/default/lxc-net to /etc/lxc-net.\n", "Q: Gedit and Filezilla Input Problem I upgraded 14.04 to 14.10.

The external speakers output sound just fine but the headphones do not. Interestingly enough, they do play a bit of static when I plug them in. That's about all that I can tell you except that I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 off of a flash drive (dual booting Windows) and I have a Dell machine. \nI've tried the solutions listed here:\nHeadphone jack not working?\nand a few from other random sources around the internet. I've made sure to completely shut down my machine after each attempted fix. I made sure to unplug and replug the headphones after Ubuntu booted up. \nShould I just try and update Ubuntu? \nI'm a bit new to Linux in general so I'm sorry for being such a noob. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\nA: Have you tried checking Pulse Audio Control? You can sometimes track down problems in the settings there. In case it's not already installed:\n$ sudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n$ pavucontrol\n\nClick on the Configuration tab, and check that the Profile is set to something sensible (e.g. \"Analog Stereo Duplex\"). Then go to the Output Devices tab, and check you can see your headphones listed in the dropdown box (and check that they are not muted). \nYou have my sympathies -- headphone problems can be a nightmare to track down sometimes. \n\nA: I had recently  the same problem on a pc (headphone jack bad, internal speaker ok):\nTo have headphone jack working, I  have now to activate \"loopback\" switch in Alsamixer :  \n\n\n*\n\n*In a maximized terminal, launch alsamixer. \n\n*If you see only one fader ( HDMI soundcard, ), press F6 , select the second device ( use arrow keys to highlight the 2nd device then press enter key) .  \n\n*If main sound card is selected, you see many faders: scroll to extreme right searching \"loopback\" switch, enable it with \"up\" arrow key:\nOn my pc , headphone works again.\n\n\nNote: this looks like a bug as \"loopback\" switch goal is to record the playing source instead of mic/line input. \n", "Q: Regarding software installation How can i install multisim ,proteus application used by Electrical and communication Department in Ubuntu 14.04Lts.\nplease send me some link how to install in command based or solution .,\nplease respond if it can be installed or any other softwares where i can make the work done of the same softwares mentioned above.\n\nA: There are some related questions here on AskUbuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alternative of Multisim or PSpice\n\n*Are there any alternative programs to Proteus available?\nSuggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run these Windows programs on Ubuntu with wine.

You can check the remove command in simulation mode, for example: \napt-get -s purge ubuntu-desktop whatever more\n\n...but in my experience you end deleting too much. BTW, trying to remove ubuntu-desktop does nothing because it is just a meta-package; you should remove its dependencies--- you can check them by:\n[romano:~] % apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop\nubuntu-desktop\n  Depends: alsa-base\n  Depends: alsa-utils\n    alsa-utils:i386\n  Depends: anacron\n {...awfully lot of lines removed...]\n\nand as you can see the dependents are for example the sound system or anacron, which I do not know if you really want to remove... so the only way is going through that list manually and remove what you want (again, simulate before!). \nTo have a text-only minimal installation I would either:\n\n\n*\n\n*install a server version of Ubuntu --- I think it comes without graphic interface  by default; \n\n*switch to a distribution more tailored to minimal installation and control (like for example Arch Linux). \n...but are you sure is worthwhile? Hard disk is cheap nowadays and you'll going to gain at most a couple of GiB...\n\nA: I would remove all the GUI libs, X, pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get purge \"^libgtk.*\" \"^libqt.*\" xserver-xorg-core \"^pulseaudio.*\"\n\nThen do an autoremove to remove left over dependencies:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nI am using purge to remove config files as well.\nCheck the list of packages to be removed, sometimes you get unexpected dependencies for CLI tools. \n", "Q: playing wav files on the iso disc Can I play audio files off of windows7 while I am trying out Ubuntu with just the iso disk without installing it.  Is it possible to access windows files while in Ubuntu?\n\nA: \nCan I play audio files off of windows7 while I am trying out Ubuntu with just the iso disk without installing it.\n\nYes, you can. There is probably not audio software installed during the live dvd session so you need to load it in to memory with Ubuntu Software Center. You can also use the command line tool called \"aplay\" to play sounds (it supports a multitude of formats). \n\nIs it possible to access windows files while in Ubuntu?\n\nYes. Ubuntu will mount them by itself during boot unless you tell it not to. \n\nA: You should be able to mount your windows partition in ubuntu and access the files from there. Be careful not to delete anything important from the windows partition while you are browsing it though. \nFirstly, you could try opening the nautilus file browser and see if your windows disk is listed in the left hand pane. If you see a disk icon that looks like it might be your windows disk, give it a click and browse the files to see. \nIf that doesn't work, you can mount it from the command line. So open a terminal, and use fdisk to find your partition:\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\n    Device    Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n    /dev/sda1               1   976773167   488386583+  ee  GPT\n    /dev/sdb1               1   976773167   46905263    ee  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nWe want the partition which has NTFS listed under System. In this example, it's /dev/sdb1, so lets try to mount it. Don't just use sdb1 in the following command though; make sure you use the /dev/sdXX name from your own fdisk -l output.\n$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/win\n$ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt/win\n\nYou should be able to browse the files in the folder /mnt/win. Hopefully that should help. \n", "Q: How to update Intel microcode properly?

I like dark colors for my desktop theme. The only dark theme I see installed by default is \"Elegance\". When I select this theme, the default colors for text areas is light text on a dark background. This is just fine when both get set, but some places don't seem to use the dark background. For example, text fields in Firefox are mostly still white background, but the system light foreground is being used. AskUbuntu itself suffers this, in the \"Tags\" field as I type this question. Buttons and text areas on some of the system menus and dialogs likewise become unreadable. See screenshot for an example, trying to add a widget to the bottom panel (see the upper left corner).\n\nIs there a way to correct this color? I don't see any method in the System Settings->Workspace Appearance->Desktop Theme dialog to customize any of the colors.\nI found a post with the same problem ( https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=106925 ), and it's marked \"solved\", but it looked like the solution was \"stop using the Elegance theme\".\n\nA: You can manually change the colors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open $HOME/.kde/share/apps/desktoptheme/Elegance/colors in your favorite editor (vim, Kate, Sublime, ...)\n\n*Locate the [Colors:Button] section\n\n*Change ForegroundActive and ForegroundNormal to some darker color\n\n\n*\n\n*Colors are written as R,G,B values. You can use some color picker to get the values for the color you want.\n\n\n*Save the file and logout/login (changing theme to something else and the back to Elegance also works)\n\n\nJust as an example, here are the colors I used (still needs to be a bit darker I guess):\nForegroundNormal=86,85,84\nForegroundActive=86,85,84\n\nand this is the result:\n\n", "Q: Strange font rendering after installing Dolphin After installing and testing KDE's Dolphin for a while the font rendering (or maybe anti-aliasing?) in non-GTK (e.g. Chrome and Thunderbird) programs looks strange.

I don't want it and don't use it, but it is part of the base package, so I'm pretty sure it will just re-install on upgrades if I try uninstalling it, plus somebody else on the computer may use it at some point.\n\nA: You should uninstall kde-telepathy-desktop-applets package:\nsudo apt-get remove kde-telepathy-desktop-applets\n\nIt should not get installed normally on upgrades.\nThen re-logout into your KDE session. To apply changes to your taskbar immediately without re-logout restart plasmashell process:\npkill plasmashell; plasmashell &\n\nStill if you want to make sure this package won't get installed (I've seen it installed automatically when upgrading 17.10 to 18.04) eventually you can blacklist it (see https://askubuntu.com/a/249447 for details) by creating /etc/apt/preferences.d/kde-telepathy-desktop-applets_blacklist file with the following content:\n# Prevent this plasmoid from being installed.\n# See https://askubuntu.com/a/995094 for details.\nPackage: kde-telepathy-desktop-applets\nPin: release *\nPin-Priority: -1\n\n\nA: If chat is starting at login, you can open the settings window from the contacts list, go to the \"General\" section, and uncheck \"Restore last presence on login\".\nThat doesn't disable the instant messaging icon in the panel (it just shows \"offline\" when it's not running).  To get rid of the icon, right-click an empty space in the system tray (e.g. between icons) and choose \"System Tray Settings\".  Go to the \"Display\" section and uncheck \"Instant Messaging Presence\".\n\nA: It might be a little late but I just found out an easier method, in case anyone ever wonders in the future.\nGo to \"System Settings -> Startup and Shutdown -> Background Services\".\nIn the lower box which is labeled \"Startup Services\" you will be able to check and uncheck services in the \"Use\" column.\nUncheck \"Accounts\" if you want to disable the Instant Messenger on startup which will also disable the tray icon.\nLog out and in again to see the change.\nBy the way, I am using Kubuntu 15.10.\n", "Q: How to install d3dx9_43?

When I unplug my external monitor (I'm on a laptop so this happens often) the mouse gets a second pointer just below the normal one but rotated 90° counter-clockwise.  I think the rotation is due to the external monitor also being rotated 90° counter-clockwise.  The double mouse pointer sometimes goes away if I restart gnome-shell, but often stays.\nHere's a photo of the result (a screenshot wouldn't capture the pointer): http://imgur.com/Qt71709\n\nA: Not an answer as such although I did inadvertently get rid of the second cursor!\nI am getting the same issue - intermittently - since I upgraded from 14.04 as well.\nInterestingly, the \"solution\" was to mouse over the image you posted! I opened it to see if it was the same issue as mine and just as I was noticing the top pointer appears to be the \"active\" pointer in that it changes icons as the context changes - the second pointer vanished as I moved it out of the image window!\nIt hasn't reoccured even though I've moved it from window to window (one of my screens is also rotated 90 degrees) and I've swapped windows. Yet to reproduce the problem but I'm bookmarking this issue to see if mousing over and then out of the image window works again!\n\nA: It's a Xserver-Xorg-Video-Intel Package BUG.

In any case there is a specific error when credentials are wrong and I'm getting a generic one. \"Connection failed\".\nMy current theory, which I want to test, is that it's a bad update. I want to revert all updates back to 20 days ago and then step forward so I can find out exactly which version or series of updates is causing trouble. How can I do this?\n\nA: So what I found was some behavior I think is not supported by the Linux clients.  I loaded a Windows 7 VM and the stock Cisco VPN client. When I ran it from Windows, I was prompted for all the usual but afterwards there was an additional prompt for \"The Next\" RSA key after the one that I had used. So what I think happened is that this behavior was triggered by a Windows password change and it is not supported in the Linux clients. \nWork around: When you change your Windows password, immediately log in to the VPN from any Windows machine to eliminate the behavior.  \n", "Q: Unable to mount MatshitaDVD-RAM UJ-850 on Toshiba Satellite A205-S5843.

Unfortunately, you need i386 binaries for all the dependencies.  There's quite a list of these, and you even need to install the GTK+2 binaries, which are generally bad.  As well, the Linux launcher has a crash issue and crashes every time you try and use it, on 14.04.  This renders it unusable.\nHowever, I had found another option.

It has the Pentium M CPU so, I had to forcepae in order for it to install. Now that it's installed I'm noticing the ui is extremely slow. When a window fades out it refreshes once every 2 seconds or so. It seems the computer itself is pretty fast, just the window animations seem to make it unbearably slow. Is there anything I may be doing wrong? I think it may be a video card driver issue but, I don't know how to find the driver and install it.  \n\nA: Ubuntu's default desktop, Unity, is likely too much for your computer to handle.\nIf you want to use an Ubuntu flavor that may perform better, I recommend Lubuntu. It has a more lightweight desktop that uses less resources. Hopefully you have upgraded the amount of RAM in your Latitude; a quick search shows that it came with 128MB, which is too low, even for Lubuntu.\nIf Lubuntu does not perform well, then you should try some other distros. Distrowatch is a good resource for discovering new distros. A few I would look into would be Puppy Linux and Dam Small Linux just from my memory.\n\nA: I don't think the problems with the intel chipset.  The problem is, like you initially suspected, the video; specifically the Radeon 9000 chipset with 32MB of memory. If you had the ATi driver installed when you upgraded, it almost assuredly won't work correctly, according to some random forum posters - along with personal experience. The open source Radeon driver should have been fine, though.  According to the link that was posted earlier, you should be OK with the RV250 driver.  You can confirm this with\nless /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nLook for something like (II) LoadModule: \"radeon\" or \"RV250\" or \"rv250\" - something like that.  \nI'm a little mystified by booting with forcepae - ah, I see that older Pentium M's (Banias) didn't advertise their PAE capability. Newer Pentium M's (Dothan) did advertise their PAE capability. \nThat page did recommend ToriOS (super light weight distro), nOS (12.04 rolling release distro until 2017), and Bohdi Linux (also 2017), along with Xubuntu 12.04.

CPUZ (windows app) also shows stock frequency under the CPU info, but there is another section that shows the actual frequency that the CPU is running at. Any way to access that info in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, you can install i7z using\nsudo apt-get install i7z\n\nand then run it with sudo i7z, stress your cpu using something like handbrake, and during encoding, clock speeds will be shown accurately.

After a few more minutes it will auto-mount again and the process repeats.\nIs my drive bad or is there any hope that I can get this to work?\n\nA: There have been some people using Mac OSX that have had similar problems (see here and here).\nThe solution that works for many of them (including me) was to just reformat the drive. Since your drive only stays mounted for a short time you will have to do the reformatting quickly.\nYou can do this with a tool such as gparted, but be careful you can lose data if you don't know what you are doing.\nEDIT:\nThis worked for about a week. I have since taken the bare hard drive out of the case and placed it in this new enclosure. Things seem to be working so hopefully it was just a problem with the case.\n\nA: This happened to me when I plugged my external Seagate drive into what appeared to be a USB 3.0 port on the front of my case.  Despite having a blue connector, apparently it was not actually a USB 3.0 port.  I seem to have fixed the problem by plugging the drive into one of the real USB 3.0 ports on the back of my computer.\n\nA: Probably, this is related to USB Power Management Problems: not enough power on the USB.

Hyper-V provides data from a named pipe into the VM as a COM port, as you show above.  Hyper-V, rather unhelpfully, does not connect that named pipe to the host's COM port, which is what you would need to pass the data through to your VM.\nI just wrote a Windows program that runs on the host OS and provides a link between the host COM port and the named pipe, allowing you to use the host COM port from your Ubuntu VM.\nYou need to run this as an admin user.\nhttps://github.com/tdhoward/COMpipe\n", "Q: Unable to open windows disks in ubuntu 14.04 I have done a manual dual boot of linux 14.04 lts windows 8.1.\ni created 3 drives mainly swap, home and another normal ext 4 drive.all the 3 drives together occupied 80 gb or so.\nhowever after installation i am unable to open the my normal windows drives through ubuntu like local disk c etc...\nthe following error message appears...\nUnable to access “New Volume”\nError mounting /dev/sda5 at /media/murali/New Volume: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda5\" \"/media/murali/New Volume\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda5': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

It's a work in progress and they've just recently came out with version 3.0.  Using this service, you can store your music in a directory (and multilevel directory) and direct Ampache to catalog that directory with your music.  Ampache takes it from there, store the paths and information in a MySQL database, and streams directly to your web interface.\nHere's a bit of a dated guide to it, but was the only one I could find:\nStep-by-step guide\nTo get Ampache running you need to have a LAMP stack running (which is step on in the guide, if you don't know how to setup the stack.

Sync is not backup. For example, if you sync a local folder to a remote folder and delete a file in the local folder, it will get deleted from the remote when the folders sync. Then you won't have that file in either of the folders and there will be no way to get it back.\nThe default backup software, Déjà Dup included with Ubuntu should be able to backup to the remote ssh server. It allows encryption as well.  Search here for related questions.\nIf you want a sync, look into lsyncd. It is in the Ubuntu repository.

For example I have two folders on the server one I can read and write to and one I cannot write to but can read.\nGetfacl lists their properties like this:\n\njohn@Server:~$ getfacl /exports/Stuff\ngetfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names\nfile: exports/Stuff\nowner: root\ngroup: root\nuser::rwx\ngroup::r-x\nother::r-x\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:user:john:rw-\ndefault:user:wife:rw-\ndefault:user:daughter:rw-\ndefault:group::r-x\ndefault:group:users:r--\ndefault:mask::rwx\ndefault:other::r-x\njohn@Server:~$ getfacl /exports/Photos\ngetfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names\nfile: exports/Photos\nowner: john\ngroup: root\nuser::rwx\ngroup::r-x\nother::r-x\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:user:john:rw-\ndefault:user:wife:rw-\ndefault:group::r-x\ndefault:group:users:r--\ndefault:mask::rwx\ndefault:other::r-x\n\nNow I see that I am the owner of Photos and root is the owner of folder Stuff an that seems to be the largest difference between them. \nAnother user on the network also using Ubuntu Gnome can access the Photos folder but cannot write, this is the behavior I wanted and I imagine Samba is controlling this as she is not listed in the ACL’s but is listed in Samba security.\nWould the best approach be to delete the file system acls with setfacl and then just use samba to control user access or should I set them to both match?\nAm I going about this in the right way? What is the best practice to handle something like this? All clients are on Linux so If you had shares that some would view and never write to, while others would read and write, how would you control access? \n\nA: Webmin is outdated and has security problems and should not be used. \nI had the same problem on 14.04. Many people answered my question and said Samba was not so screwed up on previous versions of Ubuntu. But this is a function and alias I add to my $HOME/.bashrc. \n####################\n# $1 is parameter for function\nfunction fAdduser\n{\nif [ -z $1 ]; then\n    echo \"ERROR: No user given.\";\n    echo \"Usage: cradduser USER\";\n    echo \"Sets permissions and groups for home dir of user.\";\n    echo \"Also sets up samba for user.\";\n    echo \" \";\n    return;\nfi\n\n# Add new user $1 and add to group 'users'.\n# -m = make home dir\n# -G GROUP = assign to group\nsudo useradd -m -G users $1 || { echo \"Error in useradd\"; return 1; };\nsudo usermod -p $1 $1;\necho \"fAdduser: Their password is now the same as their username.\"\nsudo passwd -u $1;\necho \"fAdduser: Now enter their password.\";\nsudo passwd $1; \n\n# Now add to samba users. This linux user uses this password for Samba.\n# The user is the same, the Samba password is not. \n# -a = add user\n# -e = enable user\nsudo smbpasswd -ae $1;\n\n# Now change permissions for Samba on their home dir.\nTDIR=/home/$1;\necho \"Changing permissions and group on $TDIR files for Samba...\";\nsudo chmod a+rw $TDIR;\nsudo chmod -R a+rw $TDIR/*;\nsudo chgrp users $TDIR;\nsudo chgrp -R users $TDIR/*;\necho \"These are the users in group 'users'\";\ngetent group users;\necho \"Added user $1\";\n}\n\n\nalias myadduser='fAdduser'\nalias mysambareset='sudo restart smbd; sudo restart nmbd; sudo service smbd restart'\n\nEdit and save your .bashrc, then do this: source $HOME/.bashrc to make the changes into effect. The function fAdduser adds a new user and sets them up for Samba. Review the steps here and see if you did them all.\nTo set up a Samba user do this: myadduser USERNAME. \nIf you change your Samba config file, save it and do this: mysambareset.\nAfter much conflicting advice, and much trial and error, this is what works for me. \n", "Q: installing pd-extended in 14.04 says requires installation of untrusted packages and crashes software center I followed the instructions from http://puredata.info/docs/faq/debian\nFor Pd-extended releases, use the apt.puredata.info repository.

I read a lot of posts and tried lots of ways but still cannot make it.\nLet me explain what I want.\nI have a ubuntu 12.04. I need to run a daemon script whenever I reboot the machine. After reboot, I do a sudo su, type in my password then do a perl /usr/local/xxxxx/xxxxx.pl to start it. However, this script(not written by me) has so many dependency under root, so if I do sudo perl /usr/local/xxxxx/xxxxx.pl directly, it won't start because it cannot find some link and modules.\nI tried to add perl /usr/local/xxxxx/xxxxx.pl or sudo perl /usr/local/xxxxx/xxxxx.pl to rc.local, none of them works.\nI tried write a script to simulate my step to sudo su then run it, but the script stops after sudo su.\nAlso tried many other ways like modify visudo, but no lucky.\nupdate:\nI didn't changed  ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile, here I paste them:\n~/.bashrc:\n# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.\n# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)\n# for examples\n\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\n# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.\n# See bash(1) for more options\nHISTCONTROL=ignoreboth\n\n# append to the history file, don't overwrite it\nshopt -s histappend\n\n# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\n# check the window size after each command and, if necessary,\n# update the values of LINES and COLUMNS.\nshopt -s checkwinsize\n\n# If set, the pattern \"**\" used in a pathname expansion context will\n# match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.\n#shopt -s globstar\n\n# make less more friendly for non-text input files, see lesspipe(1)\n[ -x /usr/bin/lesspipe ] && eval \"$(SHELL=/bin/sh lesspipe)\"\n\n# set variable identifying the chroot you work in (used in the prompt below)\nif [ -z \"$debian_chroot\" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then\n    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)\nfi\n\n# set a fancy prompt (non-color, unless we know we \"want\" color)\ncase \"$TERM\" in\n    xterm-color) color_prompt=yes;;\nesac\n\n# uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned\n# off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window\n# should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt\n#force_color_prompt=yes\n\nif [ -n \"$force_color_prompt\" ]; then\n    if [ -x /usr/bin/tput ] && tput setaf 1 >&/dev/null; then\n    # We have color support; assume it's compliant with Ecma-48\n    # (ISO/IEC-6429).

One of them can talk to internet (say Machine1) and the other can not due to network restrictions (say Machine2).\nMachine 2 needs some specific software to be installed, for example I may need to install google-chrome (just as an example) on this machine.\nWhat I tried is to create a /localrepo/amd64 diretory on Machine 1. Downloaded the stable .deb package and put it in this /localrepo/amd64 directory. \nThis directory has a link symbolic link at /var/www/html, so the machine at least over local network can access this directory.\nI ran dpkg-scanpackages amd64 | gzip -9c > amd64/Packages.gz that generated a Packages.gz file.\nOn the Machine1 I edit the sources.list file to add \nhttp://Machine2FQDN/localrepo amd64/\n\nI comment out all other lines that were trying to point to various ubuntu repos.\nI do an apt-get update and then try to install the package, I got a dependency issue.\nNow, my question is if I want all the dependencies for the .deb file to be downloaded at Machine1 localrepo diractory what is the way for it.\nI have seen answers like run the apt-get install -f, which does not work in my case, I can not allow Machine 2 to talk to ubuntu repos directly and resolve dependencies via apt-get. I do not need every single package in cache to be copied to this local repo, I need only the specific associated dependency packages to get downloaded (not installed) when I download a package through a single command.\nDo we have a solution for that?\nPlease let me know if you need any further information.\nNote: I know running apt-cache depends google-chrome-stable lists the dependencies, but I need those dependencies to be downloaded to my own custom folder /localrepo/\n\nA: The problem lies in here \n\nI comment out all other lines that were trying to point to various ubuntu repos. \n\nIf you comment out all the repo lines from the disconnected machine, How will it get other necessary .deb files to satisfy request if your local repository cannot provide that file? \nFor example, If Google chrome requires a.deb and b.deb and You installed a.deb in your connected machine in some point in time. Later you downloaded b.deb for google chrome and put only b.deb in the local repository, missing the a.deb file in your local repo. In this case, the disconnected machine, which can only request to the Local repo cannot not get a.deb file and it will generate a dependency error message.\n Permanent solution \nIf you really want this type of settings, then you should make sure that both of the PC are in the same state regarding packages installed. And anytime you install something in connected machine, you should backup the .deb files and put theme in the Local repo for disconnected machines.\n Temporary solution \nAnother solution  could be, running a Live system in the connected machine and download or install the required package in there. In this way, You can get all the required packages for a new Ubuntu installation. Which would be sufficient for the disconnected machine. Grab the .deb files, put them in Local repo and install from other machine.\nHope this will help.\n\nA: If machine1 and machine2 were identical to each other, you could do this on machine 1:\n sudo apt-get install -dy your-package\n scp /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb machine2:/somewhere\n # create your local repo with all those .debs\n\nNow, if you start installing software in machine1, this won't work, because then a package which is already installed and satisfies a dependency will not be downloaded again and thus will not be in /var/cache/apt/archives. This is also an issue if the machines were installed from essentially different Ubuntu versions/flavors (say, if machine1 is 14.04 desktop and machine2 is 12.04 server).\nI wrote a tool called dpkg-offline which may help, you basically tell it which ISO you installed machine2 from (you need to have a local copy of the ISO) and which packages you wish to download, it will produce a tar.gz with all the dependencies needed to install those packages on a system that was cleanly installed from that reference ISO.\ndpkg-offline doesn't work so well with 12.04 server (and older server versions), but if your machine2 is Ubuntu Desktop (any version since 10.04) or Ubuntu Server 12.10 or newer, it may just help.\nhttps://launchpad.net/dpkg-offline/\nto use it, install bzr and then bzr branch lp:dpkg-offline.

check what Ubuntu version are you running via \nuname -a\n\nIf you have the 32bit version (i386) you have to install the 64bit version (x86_64) to let your computer address more that 4GiB (Gibibytes) of RAM.\nThis is due to tecnhnical limitations of the 32bit width, as explained at the beginning of this very nice Wikipedia page.\nPlease note that similar limitations apply also for 64bit-wide architecture. Indeed, you cannot address more than 16 EiB (Exbibytes) of information.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 on Dell Latitude D600 WiFi I just recently installed lubuntu 14.04 LTS on my Dell Latitude D600. I had to forcepae in order for it to install. Once installed, I cannot get the WiFi driver to work. First, I plugged it into Ethernet and tried to install the driver with the Additional Drivers window. It looked like it worked then, once it rebooted, the driver wouldn't show up nor any wireless networks. The Additional Drivers window doesn't show it either. So, I googled it and tried with the tutorials here and here with no luck. I need the WiFi to work because I'm not going to be using it within Ethernet reach.\nAlso, this is what comes up in \n$ lspci -nn | grep 0280\n02:03.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller [14e4:4320] (rev02)\n\n\nA: Looks like I got it working by purging linux-firmware-nonfree for some reason.\n", "Q: Why do we have to call `sudo apt-get update` more than once for Ubuntu? I sometimes see update commands for Ubuntu which make it twice as this sample\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI wonder why do we have to call it twice like that? Why not just once?\n\nA: Those are two different commands. This one:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nSays to update the package index file. If there is a newer version of a package available, replace it in the index.\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSays to compare all the packages installed on the system to the updated package index and offer all upgrades available.\n", "Q: How do I make an entire directory executable? I have an entire folder dedicated to python scripts.\nI'm tired of doing chmod on every new python script that I write.\nIs there a way to make every file inside my folder executable if it is a python script?\nIt would be nice to have a script that checks whenever a new .py script is created and if there is a new .py script make it executable right there on the spot.\n\n\n*\n\n*I use Vim.\n\n\nA: Another good option is Incron. It works on inotify with specifiable conditions for a given location.\nSo I can say watch this folder, when you see a file created, run a command.\nJust as a sample incrontab...\n/path/to/scripts IN_CREATE chmod +x $@$#  # <--- this arcane bit is path ($@) + file ($#)\n\nOne could similarly use the path/file as arguments to a bash script to allow it to filter by .py extensions if needed.\n\nA: chmod +x /path/to/python/scripts/dir/*.py \n\nWill make executable all current .py files in directory /path/to/python/scripts/dir.\nI'm not aware of an auto-tool as you describe. It might be possible to have a macro in your editor that could do this, but not with the editor I use. ;-)\n\nA: As a first step, you could try this in your ~/.vimrc:\nautocmd BufWritePost *.py silent execute \"! chmod +x %\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This runs chmod +x on the filename for all .py files when you write to them. Looking at the list of events (:h events), I can't find an event where a new file is created, so I had to settle for running each time it is written to.\n\n*The first time the chmod is applied, the file gets changed, and vim will alert you to that:\n\"test.py\" [New] 0L, 0C written\nW16: Warning: Mode of file \"test.py\" has changed since editing started\nSee \":help W16\" for more info.\n[O]K, (L)oad File:\n\nI tried a couple of tricks to make it autoread just for this change, but no luck. So you'll have to press Enter twice.\n\nA: When initiated, the script below automatically changes the permissions of all files of a given type (extension) in a directory (one time). After that, the script checks the directory every 5 seconds for newly added files, and changes the permissions if the file is of the given type (in this case a .py file)\nIt has a few options: in this case, it makes the newly added files executable, but other actions are possible too, as defined in the line: command = \"chmod +x\". Additionally, you can define (change) on what kind of files (language extensions) the action should be performed.\nHow to use\nCopy the script below into an empty file. Save it as change_permission.py and run it in the background by the command:\npython3 <script> <folder_to_watch>\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\ncommand = \"chmod +x\"; check_interval = 5; extensions = (\".py\")\n\ndef current_files():\n    read = subprocess.check_output([\"ls\", directory]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    return [item for item in read.split(\"\\n\") if item[item.rfind(\".\"):] in extensions]\n\ninitial_files = current_files()\nfor file in initial_files:\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command+\" \"+directory+\"/\"+file])\n\nwhile True:\n    update = current_files()\n    for file in update:\n        if not file in initial_files:\n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command+\" \"+directory+\"/\"+file])  \n    initial_files = update\n    time.sleep(check_interval)\n\n*Note: if you need sudo privileges, simply run the script with sudo\n\nA: Here is some info with a few commands that might help, check out http://ss64.com/bash/syntax-permissions.html\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 775 # change all file permissions in current directory\n\nfind . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755 # change directory permissions\n\nYou could use the following header script. Place mkscript.sh in your $PATH. Execute mkscript.sh from the working directory where the python scripts are stored. The script creates some useful header info, titles the script and makes it executable, and then opens the chosen editor; in your case VIM. \nI modified mkscript.sh, it will produce scripts with the python extension *.py \nThe variable ${PYTHON_VERSION} is called, so PYTHON_VERSION=\"/usr/bin/python --version\" has been added to  the /etc/environment file.\nHave a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\n#!/bin/bash -       \n#title           :mkscript.sh\n#description     :This script will make a header for a PYTHON script.\n#author      :bgw\n#date            :20111101\n#version         :0.4    \n#usage       :bash mkscript.sh\n#notes           :Install Vim and Emacs to use this script.\n#bash_version    :4.1.5(1)-release\n#==============================================================================\n\ntoday=$(date +%Y%m%d)\ndiv=======================================\n\n/usr/bin/clear\n\n_select_title(){\n\n    # Get the user input.\n    printf \"Enter a title: \" ; read -r title\n\n    # Remove the spaces from the title if necessary.\n    title=${title// /_}\n\n    # Convert uppercase to lowercase.\n    title=${title,,}\n\n    # Add .sh to the end of the title if it is not there already.\n    [ \"${title: -3}\" != '.py' ] && title=${title}.py\n\n    # Check to see if the file exists already.\n    if [ -e $title ] ; then \n        printf \"\\n%s\\n%s\\n\\n\" \"The script \\\"$title\\\" already exists.\" \\\n        \"Please select another title.\"\n        _select_title\n    fi\n\n}\n\n_select_title\n\nprintf \"Enter a description: \" ; read -r dscrpt\nprintf \"Enter your name: \" ; read -r name\nprintf \"Enter the version number: \" ; read -r vnum\n\n# Format the output and write it to a file.\nprintf \"%-16s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%-16s%-8s\\n\\\n%s\\n\\n\\n\" '#!/usr/bin/python -' '#title' \":$title\" '#description' \\\n\":${dscrpt}\" '#author' \":$name\" '#date' \":$today\" '#version' \\\n\":$vnum\" '#usage' \":./$title\" '#notes' ':' '#python_version' \\\n\":${PYTHON_VERSION}\" \\#$div${div} > $title\n\n# Make the file executable.\nchmod +x $title\n\n/usr/bin/clear\n\n_select_editor(){\n\n    # Select between Vim or Emacs.\n    printf \"%s\\n%s\\n%s\\n\\n\" \"Select an editor.\" \"1 for Vim.\" \"2 for Emacs.\"\n    read -r editor\n\n    # Open the file with the cursor on the twelth line.\n    case $editor in\n        1) vim +12 $title\n            ;;\n        2) emacs +12 $title &\n            ;;\n        *) /usr/bin/clear\n           printf \"%s\\n%s\\n\\n\" \"I did not understand your selection.\" \\\n               \"Press <Ctrl-c> to quit.\"\n           _select_editor\n            ;;\n    esac\n\n}\n\n_select_editor\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04.1 Freezes Using Firefox Using an eMachines ET1331G-03w.

I am seeing an extended screen, however audio will not transition over to the TV. I've gone into sound settings, selected \"HDMI/Display Port 2\" however testing audio does not fire. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Amd driver is not recogmended even for gaming, it's a workstation driver created for workstation graphical purposes. Uninstall it and stick to using the Opensource driver. Open a terminal and type\nsudo amdconfig --uninstall\nif the driver is installed on the distribution files rather than xorg, it will give you another command like \"dpkg -r amdcccle\" and you take that command and use it with sudo.

Earlier when I used to gedit in Unity environment, when I opens a text file with gedit (considering one file is already opened in gedit), then it opens in new tab in already opened window.\nAfter installing xubuntu-desktop, Now I am using mousepad (default text-editor in Xubuntu) in Xubuntu. But when I opens text-file (considering one is already opened window) it opens in separate window instead of in new tab in opened window.\nThus, How do I get another text-file opened in new-tab instead of separate window?\nNote: If I open files using File>Open in mousepad or selecting multiple files and openwith mousepad then it opens in multiple tabs but this is different case.\n\nTo understand difference quickly try following commands and see difference:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit & gedit :- gedit opens with two tabs\n\n*mousepad & mousepad :- mousepad opens with two separate windows\n\n\nA: Looks like it isn't possible: https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11196 and https://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?id=9129\nIt should be said that using gedit in Xubuntu is not an issue.  Both use gtk, which makes gedit a native application to Xubuntu, in a sense.  \nSo forget about trying to get mousepad to work like gedit.

There's now an option in the preferences to open files in new tabs under Preferences > Window > Notebook tabs\n\n\nA: How ever Mousepad doesn't behaves like gedit and it opens new file in new window; you can use menu option : File -> Open option from Mousepad.\nAlternatively you can drag a text file to the already open Mousepad window to open the dragged file in a new tab!. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Kubuntu login problem 2 recently I installed Ubuntu on my laptop. that is something I know. then It started to update. after updated I could see now I have more versions of Linux like kubuntu. so excited i tried to log into kubuntu. but every time I entered my password it says its wrong. then I changed the version into Ubuntu and entered the password boom! it work!\nnow I need to know do they have default password to log into that version or is there anything else i do not know.

I've since wiped the disk, changed the disk type to GPT and clean installed Windows 8.1 from ISO, leaving space at the end of the partition to install Linux.\nI tried many thing and read many posts, including the excellent rodsbooks.com website.  I've tried Mint 17 and now Kubuntu 14.10.  \nI installed Kubuntu (Mint previously) and at the end of the install I received an error message about Grub.  I tried boot-repair but that also didn't work.  \nAfter reading the EFI boot loaders section on rodsbooks I decided to install rEFInd on a USB flash drive.  This worked and I could successfully boot into Kubuntu from this boot loader.  I then installed rEFInd using apt-get.  I thought I was almost there.\nI tried renaming my grubx64.efi to bootmgfw.efi in all the folders mentioned on the rodsbooks here but still I can't get my machine to start the rEFInd at boot up.  If I don't press escape during the boot process I always get Windows.\nI have never seen the Grub menu whatever I have done.\n\nA: Simply renaming both bootx64.efi in the EFI/Boot folder and bootmgfw.efi in EFI/Microsoft/Boot (adding a .bak extension for example) so that the firmware could not find either of its default options caused it to use grubx64.efi which is the rEFInd bootloader on this machine.\n", "Q: open markdown files in vim: only a few lines shown I'm facing the problem while displaying the markdown file content.\nWhen i opens the .md file in vim , it just displays few lines\nand there is s bottom bar which display line info,rest of the lines of the files are not visible.\n\nI have this in .vimrc\nau BufRead,BufNewFile *.md set filetype=markdown\n\nAny idea what is the problem here ?\n\nA: It seems that the file is folded; in that case moving on the line 2 and pressing za (or zA for recursively opening folds) should work. \nIf this is the case, there are tips here to set-up vim in order to decide how to fold files. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Command-line edit /etc/fstab I just recover my /etc/fstab file using THIS\nBut after reboot it says:\nMount failed press S to skip and M to mount manually.\non S it skip all services and just start with mount only default drive\non this system /etc/fstab looks like this. which i generated now.\nUUID=e8008245-01d3-4df3-b409-8036ad7cd0d0 / ext4  default    0     2\nUUID=ff122186-e22b-4ba6-a8fc-36ef76150bea / ext4  default    0     2\nUUID=81aa6aad-9d95-4f48-aa68-cf2b4a23f4aa / ext4  default    0     2\nUUID=7f83f0bf-31b0-4977-97ed-a40d6c8c0c9a / ext4  default    0     2\nUUID=4e8e58d8-ef0b-4ebd-8403-8fc81d3121f1 swap \n\nwhat mistake i am doing in above file?

At the moment the computer has a single hard drive, containing the whole install. What I would like to do, is to move the existing installation to the SSD (/ mount), excluding the /home folder, which I would like to keep on the current hard drive. The reason for this is, that the home folder would not fit on the SSD.\nIs there a way that I could just copy everything except the /home folder to the SSD and then mount the current hard drive's home folder to /home (of course deleting all that stuff, that was copied on the SSD). Has anyone tried this? Do you think it's possible? \nI would not like to make a new installation, as it will take a long time to reconfigure everything.    \n\nA: Not tested, but I would do it in this way if the SSD is at least the same size or bigger than HDD:\nLet's name the SSD as /dev/sda and the HDD as /dev/sdb for simplicity.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the SSD and the HDD and boot a live Ubuntu from a bootable media (CD-ROM, pendrive)\n\n\n*issue this command in a terminal: sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\n\n*when finished, mount /dev/sda and edit on it the /etc/fstab file by adding:\n/dev/sdb1 /home           ext4     noatime,nodiratime,defaults        0       2\n\n\n*Enter the /home directory of mounted /dev/sda and erase everything there.\n\n\n*Now comes the hard part: mount /dev/sdb1 and erase everything except /home directory.\n\n\n*When cleaned, enter /home and move out the directories to the root of mounted /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*Erase the empty /home directory from /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*If /dev/sda was bigger than /dev/sdb, use gparted to resize the partition to fit the disk.\n\n\n*Reboot from /dev/sda\n\n\n*Enjoy.\n\nA: The following link is a very good answer on having /home on a separate partition, it also works for having /home on a separate drive. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nSo I would do  a fresh install on the SSD, then using the link above, tell it to use /home on the HDD. You will have to reinstall your programmes but they will pick up the settings from /home. \n\nA: first, you should partition your ssd using the existing system (fdisd)\nDo not create filesystems on the newly created partitions, just use dd to copy the existing partitions to the partitions on the ssd. for example:\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=dev/sdb1\n\nFstab should be updated as wel to point to the new partitions.\nand I would suggest to keep /var on your hdd if possible as it is frequently written to.\n", "Q: How can Partition directory changes every reboot?

At first I thought it was specific applications but now im starting to think its something in ubuntu if both application are having the exact same issue. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions? could it be a package preinstalled on ubuntu? Im at a loss. Thanks\n\nA: It sounds like you are maxing out your network.  Your Torrent client should have a setting to limit the number of concurrent IP connections.  You also will need to specify different working ports for each client if you are using more than 1 since you are saying Daemons it leads me to believe you have multiple clients running each needs its own port that is port forwarded if behind the router for it to function.  Then if behind a router you would need to also specify the port range [as files download the client uses different ports for the different connections and again these need to be port forwarded as well.  I suggest you use the 10,000 area ports [I usually set like 10100 - 10102 for the different ports the client uses for the torrent networks and then set something like 10110-10140 for the range all set as both tcp and udp for the min - max port range for file downloads (I use qBittorrent which has the port range setting [newer version] some clients may lack the port range in advanced for magnet link *.tor file downloads and file downloads and if this is the case your client will run it just may not be as fast all the time as one you can specify).\nSpecifying at least 2 - 3 ports for each client instance you run should get you going and not having them conflict with each other (each one after the 1st you open will crash cause it can not use the same port already in use by the previous client instance), but specifying a different settings file for each one [if needed do a manual install installing multiple copies to different directories if the client does not already support custom settings file].\nThat should help get you running...\n", "Q: I can not start my computer after instaling ubuntu After i succesfully instal ubuntu 14 and reboot i can not start anything niether Ubuntu or windows.\nMessage which apear is \nReboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press any key.\nCan you help me what to do ? \n\nA: Check your first boot device in BIOS, If pendrive or other useb media in firstboot device, the insert boot media option will appear\n", "Q: Why `apt-get dist-upgrade` in EC2 image does not update the kernel? I've built a system running Ubuntu 14.04 on EC2, using the AMI from Ubuntu's cloud-images repository. The AMI includes kernel 3.13.0-37, but 3.13.0-39 is available as an update. \nAfter running apt-get dist-upgrade the new linux-image packages are downloaded and installed, but rebooting leaves me back in the old kernel.\nI understand there was once need to get a special \"ec2 kernel\", but that is no longer available. How can I upgrade my EC2 VM's kernel?\n\nA: This is a problem only on \"pv\" (Para-virtualized) EC2 virtual machines. In such systems, the kernel has to be patched to be able to run on the default Xen DomU setup (which is PV). Hence \"ec2 kernels\", which you can't replace on a PV machine because that would break your system.\nAWS have moved since to prefer HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine, which is the Xen term for virtualizing access to hardware devices using a hardware IOMMU, allowing native drivers in the virtual machine direct access to the hardware), so they stopped working hard on getting up to date EC2 specific kernels, and you should be able to use any kernel on an HVM virtual machine.\n", "Q: Php Obfuscator on Ubuntu 14 I am looking for PHP obfuscator without any server side plugin required.

B) - this should be done from inside Windows, while Windows is running.  You can use Windows disk management tools to do this.\nStep 2: Secondly, you will need a liveUSB of Ubuntu to change the Ubuntu partitions, as these partitions cannot be modified while they are being accessed by Ubuntu.  Because of the way your disk is arranged, this will be a two step process, at least.\nStep 2a)  Incorporate the free space into the extended partition /dev/sda4:  Booting from the LiveUSB, run the program gparted and use this program to add the extra space into /dev/sda4.  You may need to move partition /dev/sda3, depending upon how Windows handles shrinking that partition.\nStep 2b)  Using gparted, add the unused space now in /dev/sda4 to your Ubuntu partition, /dev/sda5.

A bit simplified, it is a randomized address that isn't allowed to pass routers, at all.  IPv4 private addresses can be routed through routers. They can pass hubs and switches though.\nYour machine has no global address at all, but one IPv4 link local address and one IPv6 link local address.\nIPv4 Link Local Addresses\nIf the two computers you want to communicate between are using IPv4 link local addresses, you can use them to communicate between them for example with ping(8). The link local address range is 169.254.0.0/16; see rfc3927.  Notice that link local addresses have nothing to do with global addresses or private addresses in IPv4.  Private addresses are some of these nets 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16; see rfc1918.\nSo if the computers have IPv4 addresses which are prefixed with 196.254 and are located on the same link, they can use those to communicat between them, with ping(8) or any other tool if you like.  Notice that the address usually are the same, but can change between reboots and networks.\nIPv6 Link Local Addresses\nIf the two computers are located on the same link and uses IPv6, you can use their link local adresses. All devices that support IPv6 must have a link local addresses.  The address ranges of IPv6 are found in rfc4291 and is in net fe80::/64.\nSo any IPv6 address with the prefix fe80:: are a link local address and are uniq to the link.  So you can use those addresses to reach other computers on the same link, but you must add the interface you uses as a suffix to the address (or tell the application which interface to use.) That suffix starts with a % character followed by the interface id.\n\nping6 ffe8::54c7:ef39:a57a:1802%11\n\nNotice the %11 in the end of the address.\nGlobal IPv6 addresses usually is in the net 2000::/3, starts with a 2 or 3, but are always (nearly) divided in '/64'-net on lan. But look up the rfc:s to learn more about this.\n\nA: try ping6\nman 8 ping6\n\nyou are running a class B subnet and both machines appear to be on the same subnet.

I know this question has been asked (and answered) before, but it seems my situation is unique, because I cannot have any of the solution to work.\nRunning, I need to rename all my photos from *.JPG to *.jpg.\nLet's say I don't need recursive, just all the pictures in the same folder.\nThe problem I meet is this one:\nmv: ‘P1010521.JPG’ and ‘p1010521.jpg’ are the same file\n\nSame problem using rename, with that kind of command:\nrename 's/\\.JPG$/.jpg/' *.JPG\nP1020558.JPG not renamed: P1020558.jpg already exists\n\n\nA: If αғsнιη is right in his comment, and I think he is, OP's problem is that a similarly named file already exists. If that is the case, the script will have to check if the targeted file name (lowercase) already exists, and (only) if so, rename the original file additionally (not only lowercase extension) to prevent the name error, e.g.\nimage1.JPG\n\nto\nrenamed_image1.jpg\n\nsince image1.jpg would raise an error\nIf so, a python solution to rename could be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\ndirectory = sys.argv[1]\nfor file in [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith(\".JPG\")]:\n        newname = file[:file.rfind(\".\")]+\".jpg\"\n        if os.path.exists(directory+\"/\"+newname):\n                newname = \"renamed_\"+newname\n        shutil.move(directory+\"/\"+file, directory+\"/\"+newname)\n\nThe script renames:\nimage1.JPG -> image1.jpg\n\nbut if image1.jpg already exists:\nimage1.JPG -> renamed_image1.jpg\n\n###How to use\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as rename.py, make it executable and run it by the command:\n<script> <directory_of_files>\n\n\nA: really easy with mmv:\nsudo apt install mmv\n\nmmv \\*.JPEG \\#1.jpeg\n\n\nA: It is really simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename to something else than the same value with different case\nrename 's/\\.JPG$/\\.jpgaux/' *.JPG\n\n\n*Now rename that something else to .jpg back again, but lowercase this time\nrename 's/\\.jpgaux$/\\.jpg/' *.jpgaux\n\nDemo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/8853245/\nSource: How to change extension of multiple files from command line?

You can leave the latest session file and delete the rest. \nSince it is only 200MB, you can take a copy of the files to some other directory and you can use the same if something goes wrong\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Unable to change brightness using after root access Case-1\nRecently I read a question(Brightness is reset to Maximum on every Restart).

The script works and runs on startup (called from rc.local), but how do I get the output of the script to display in the CLI?  Echo does not work because there is nothing to echo to yet during startup, correct?  Is there a \"buffer\" that could dump the stdout of startup processes after login?  When I deployed this on ubuntu desktop, I opened a new terminal window and all program output would go to it.  I am trying to mimic this behavior on CLI so that if I ssh in, I  can see the status of the stream. i.e. \"Client Connected\", \"Bind Success\" \nThanks!\n\nA: One way to do it would be to run a script at startup to execute your program in a screen session.

It's a clumsy solution, a bit slow to respond (maybe 20 seconds), the print quality isn't quite as good as printing directly (some slightly odd fringing effects), it uses up my finite data (no idea how much) and adds the (unnecessary but probably not too problematic) restriction that the Internet needs to be alive.\n\nA: The answer listed above by Mark Smith worked for me (edit: the native solution involving downloading drivers from the brother site, not the Google cloud print one). I didn't need to create the two directories listed as they were already present on my system. Once I installed the two packages I downloaded from the Brother site, I went to add a printer using the regular Printers app on Ubuntu 14.04, in which the Brother now appeared as a local printer (BrGenML1).

It's usually the last option.\n\n*Look for your Ubuntu partition in the list. Identify it by its size, type, or the comments in the last column. Its type is probably ext4 and the last column could read Ubuntu or something. That's the partition.\n\n*Double click the partition. Pick \"Use as\" ext4, type in / for the \"Mounting Point\", and click OK. Check the format? box next to it so that the partition will be formatted.\n\n*Now, your table should read mount point / next to your old Ubuntu partition, and you might see a partition with type swap somewhere. Click next.\n\n\nThis will format that partition (because we chose format?) and install Ubuntu on it (because we made it mount point /). If you follow these steps, nothing will happen to your other partitions (such as Windows).\n\nA: My solution was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows 7\n\n*Navigate to Disk Management in System\n\n*Right click and remove the old Ubuntu partition(s) that you don't want any more (I made just one to install Ubuntu, but that had some how become 2). You might have to right click again and delete, until there is a partition left labelled 'Unallocated'.\n\n*Now you can restart and install Ubuntu from the DVD as you did the first time.\nDone.

Obviously more than I wanted.\nFinally, after many Google searches, I came up with:\ngrep -rn --include=\"*.py\" \"search-pattern\"\n\nThis did the job and found all python files I was searching for. As a bonus it also prints the line numbers containing the search-pattern.\nBut one problem remained: some \"permission denied\" errors. How do I get rid of those?\nI thought handling grep would be easy but it turned out being complex to get nice results, with line numbering and without errors..\nAny help would be highly appreciated :)\n\nA: You are getting these Permission denied errors because there are some python files that your user does not have permission to read, so grep is not working for those files (you can't search them).\nYou want to \"get rid of\" the Permission denied errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add 2>/dev/null to the end of your command like this:\ngrep -rn --include=\"*.py\" \"search-pattern\" 2>/dev/null\n\nThis suppresses all error messages, so you won't see the Permission denied errors popping up. But this obviously still means that grep is not searching those files, so if they do contain your search-pattern, you won't see them in the output.\n\nExplanation:\n  In Linux, there are three things called file descriptors: stdin, stdout, stderr. If you run a command and it gives you an error, the error is written to the file descriptor stderr. By default, stderr outputs the errors to the terminal. So what we can do is redirect the errors, i.e. we redirect stderr somewhere else instead of the terminal. We redirect stuff in Linux by using the > sign. So where are we going to redirect stderr? To /dev/null. /dev/null is a special file; think of it as a black hole. Anything you redirect to it gets thrown away. Finally, we refer to stderr as simply the number 2. So 2>/dev/null tells Linux to redirect 2 to /dev/null. 1 means stdout (which is the normal output of a command, i.e. not errors). So, for example, if you wanted to save the actual output of your grep command to a file rather than have it displayed in the terminal, you can use 1>/path/to/filename, which will redirect stdout to that file.\n\n\n*Use sudo with your command, assuming that you have the privileges:\nsudo grep -rn --include=\"*.py\" \"search-pattern\"\n\nIf your username has root privileges (i.e. if you're an administrator on the machine), using sudo before a command runs it as the root user, so you will never get the Permission denied errors and grep will search those files and output the search-pattern if it finds it inside them.\n\nA: It's a common problem, you can solve it directly from command line.\nYou can use --devices=skip to ignore the special device files (source of errors and endless loops on many systems).\nExecute sudo chown -R new_owner_name file_pattern to change the file ownership recursively and avoid the permission errors.\nIf you redirect the error stream with COMMAND 2> DESTINATION_OR_/dev/null the errors still happen and you won't get the desired results from grep.\nIf possible never use sudo automatically to do the analysis (it can be a weak spot of the system), try to change the file ownership when needed. A graphical version of sudo is available if you need to ask the user for a permission.\n\nPlease, feel free to comment under here if you have more inherent questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow if I'm of any help.\nHave a nice day.\n", "Q: how do i access files i do not have permissions for?

I know a few people who have redundant XP boxes that would serve some impecunious people well if I could get simple systems up on them. \n\nA: You are asking for a way of installing an OS on a machine that does not boot from CD nor from USB and complain that it is not easy. Do you think installing any OS on such a machine would be easy? Even Windows (which is backed by Billions of Dollars) has pretty much nothing it could do at that point.\nBut you are lucky, Linux has solutions for pretty much everything, all you need is some expertise and some time:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would not recommend installing regular Ubuntu on any machine that old. Get Lubuntu, it uses a different desktop called LXDE which is way more lightweight than Unity.\n\n*If the desktop gets unresponsive, hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1 will give you a console where you can enter commands like \"top\" that will tell you which process hung up, etc. \n\n*If you don't have enough experience with Linux and try something as tricky as you are describing, maybe it is best to find a Linux user in your area that can visit you and help you with the setup. Local Linux user groups are also generally happy to help you! http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group\nAnother place where you might get help is at your local university. Many CS students use Linux, and some student organizations might help you.\n\n*Another place to come looking for help is, of course, the internet. Look for an IRC channel or forum where you might find people willing to help. I am sorry, but your question is way too broad and not specific enough to tell you exactly which steps to follow. You either need a complete guide-through or post questions about which specific problems you encounter. And no, \"Desktop freezes\" is NOT specific enough.\n\n*If you could get a working CD/DVD drive (maybe just \"borrow\" it from another old PC), you should be out of trouble. Booting from a CD/DVD drive is still the best supported option for installing any OS, and there are plenty of walkthroughs and wiki articles regarding any specific aspect of it.\n\nA: You could take the hard drive out of your laptop, plug it into a computer that can boot from USB or does have a working DVD drive, install Ubuntu, and then put it back in your laptop.  However...  Why don't you just try installing Ubuntu on decent hardware?  As another user stated, you'd have the same problem installing any other OS, not just Linux...\n\nA: There's a possibility that the BIOS on the laptop is upgradable.  You may be able to find a firmware download that will enable boot-from-USB.\nIf you wanted to replace the CD drive on your laptop, you're looking at $60+ for a new IDE unit. Since the cheapest refurb laptop on Newegg goes for about $135, I'd say replacing the optical drive isn't worth it.\nThe last option is as ErlVolton described.  Remove the HD, connect it to another machine, install from there, and then put it back in your POS laptop.\n", "Q: Installing Steam in Ubuntu I am currently using Ubuntu 14.10.

However, after trying a few different tutorials I am still unable to boot to Ubuntu Gnome or see Grub.

The high-speed card is also plenty fast for my purposes. \n\nA: I have this working with SecureBoot Enabled and TPM Enabled by simply rerunning grub-install after anything touches grub (i.e. installing new kernel).  Sometimes first boot takes a few minutes but afterwards, it always boots fast.\nBTW, I have no windows installed, only Ubuntu.  I have found that for an emergency, if your system stops booting you can boot from install usb but then in grub press 'c' and do this to boot from HD:\ngrub> set root=(hd1,2)\ngrub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2\ngrub> initrd /initrd.img\ngrub> boot\n\n\nA: First read\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI?\nfor some UEFI specific advice.  Old tutorials might not even mention what's needed for the new UEFI machines.\nThe removable media (USB or SD) are given almost no attention in the tutorials anyway, so whatever the installer does, it typically needs to be fixed for the non-internal media.  boot-repair might fix the \"missing\" bootloader but you can just copy bootloader into the right location, it's just a file copy under UEFI.  Non-secure boot uses grubx64.efi, so that's the file to put into /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi (on the FAT32 300MB EFI partition).\nNow the next issue is the SD card install from a live USB -- the grub.cfg file's devices tend to get mixed up when extra devices (like the install media) get in the device enumeration (384633).  Again, manually correct the first boot, then run sudo update-grub to fix the file.\nOnce you get the bootloader and grub.cfg file fixed on the SD card, you should be able to boot.  Then you can think about optimizing the card for better performance, moving as much into ram as possible.\n\nA: We got it work on Surface Pro 3 by doing the USB Ubuntu 14.04 install following the posts above.  However, we needed to set the bootloader to be on /dev/sda2 (second partition with label EFI Partition) not the default one /dev/sda ATA SAMSUNG.  This solved the issue for us.\nWe also found you can access the Ubuntu install by using the Update and Recover feature with the Restart Now-->Use Device.  We then selected Ubuntu and it loaded our GRUB menu the next reboot.  However, this was only partial fix since that procedure of loading first in Windows 8.1 was required each time.   After a lot of following forums and other procedures we just decided to do fresh install and found the EFI Partition needed to be selected to solve the issue.\n\nA: Also might need to disable the TPM as well as the Secure Boot.  We found Surface Pro 3 has very long boot time with TPM (probably checking hardware changes possibly resulting from Ubuntu operations?).   Also, we found that after some time the Grub menu disappeared after working for many boot cycles.  Perhaps the TPM is the culprit changing the boot procedure or preventing certain operations on boot?   \n", "Q: Virtualbox Guest OS unexpectely resets in Ubuntu 14.10 Problem with VirtualBox \nAfter upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 I have a problem with\nstarting a VirtualBox virtual machine.

Based on various sources on the web as well as one from my friend who is an experienced game developer, this is a typical setup:\n\n\nWindow.java | Window setup class\nGame.java | Main game class\n\n\nBut when I attempt to run the Game class, the frame opens and then freezes, the only thing I have control of is my mouse, nothing else. I know the problem occurs in the render method, because the program runs fine when that method has an empty body. \nI copied the code exactly from the tutorial in which it runs fine, and my friend who sent me an almost identical version which works on his computer, causes the same freeze for me. In both the tutorial and my friend's testing, the operating system is Windows, which causes me to believe that this is strictly an Ubuntu/Linux problem.\nI have an Intel i7 3.4gHZ processor, and 8 gigs of RAM, so processing and memory shouldn't be the issue here. Any ideas of what is going on? I know that this is more of a programming question, but the fact that the problem seems to be Ubuntu-specific leads me to post it here. \nEDIT\nI've isolated the problem to one line in the Game class: bs.show(). For some reason, it is freezing as soon as I try to show the buffer strategy. If I create the buffer strategy with 1 buffer, it works fine, with anything greater than 1, it freezes. \nWhen it froze the most recent time, I opened a virtual desktop and ran top, the weirdest thing is that Java was taking up less than 2% CPU and 6% memory. That just doesn't add up. I really need some help for what is going on here, I've gone about as far as I can go and I don't want to force any more restarts on my machine. \n\nA: I'm having the same problem when running your code. It seems to be a performance issue. To fix it, addSystem.setProperty(\"sun.java2d.opengl\", \"true\"); to the main method in Game.java like this,\n public static void main(String args[]) {\n    System.setProperty(\"sun.java2d.opengl\", \"true\");\n    new Game();\n }\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You are using the main awt-thread itself.  It should be left alone to cater to the User Responsiveness.  Read up a bit about using the SwingUtilities2.invokeLater and SwingUtilities2.invokeAndWait methods to get rid of this freezing window issues in the Java Swing Applications.\nThe approach would be to:\n\n1) Do your extensive stuff in a Runnable (you are using one)\n2) In your main method, pass on the Runnable instance to one of above\n  two methods in the SwingUtilities2 class\n\nIf you want to go further, you can also consider using Worker Threads.\n", "Q: How do I create an EXT4 file system with block size 1024 and no reserved blocks from the command line?

Can ubuntu be installed on a flash drive and booted from a flash drive, or does it have to be installed on a hard drive>\n\nA: yes, you can run Ubuntu from flash drive. To do that, just download the .iso file of Ubuntu and make your flash drive bootable by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Universal USB Installer in windows\n\n*\"Startup Disk Creator\" in Ubuntu\n\n\nA: It is possible to make a \"persistent Ubuntu\" using unetbootin, but I haven't had much luck with it.\nYou can install Ubuntu on a flash drive just like you install it on a hard drive. Just boot from that bootable Ubuntu flash drive, plug in a secong flash drive, and install Ubuntu to it rather than to your hard drive. However, there are a couple of down sides.\n\n\n*\n\n*It will be very slow, because USB flash drives are slow. (USB3 might be better.)\n\n*It will not be very portable. When you perform the installation,\nconfiguration files get set up for the target system. Trying to boot\nanother radically different computer from that USB drive will likely\nlead to problems.\n\n\nI don't know what your needs are, but every time I've tried this, I ended up spending a lot of effort for something that just can't be a solution to any of my problems.\n", "Q: How do I install a Flash player in Chromium?

Also compiz/unity is now usable! \nThe CPU is generally at full speed but some compressed air, keyboard removal and a vacuum cleaner can be used to restore the cooling architecture and keep fan speeds to reasonable levels. \nTo make this sticky I found two files in /etc/init.d that put the acpi mode back to laggy 'on demand' - one I think is called 'ondemand' which I edited to comment out the effectual echo line (this script seems designed to change the power mode after 60 seconds startup) and another I think was called cpufrequtils which had a setting at the top. \nWith this and setting swappiness to 10 I think Ubuntu is usable on this laptop.\nFlash player in Chromium not so good.\nI think Windows might have better acpi (or perhaps is better at switching it based on power source by default)\nLaptop back to life :)\n", "Q: How do you make a NTFS disk Partition?

What do you think is the reason that the OS occupies this amount of RAM? Is this normal? I checked the list of my active processes and there are no processes occupying so much memory. \n\nA: It is not normal - it should occupy more.

You can read more about all that here: \"WhatsApp and Viber in Ubuntu 13.04\". But, we will now get WhatsApp to work using Pidgin, the universal chat client, with a third party plugin called whatsapp-purple. Do note that WhatsApp cannot be activated on your Desktop and phone at the same time.\nYowsup\nYowsup is - simply put - A library to use WhatsApp from Python. Not so simply put:\n\nYowsup allows you to login and use the Whatsapp service\n  and provides you with all capabilities of an official Whatsapp client,\n  allowing you to create a full-fledged custom Whatsapp client. - \n  About Yowsup, github.com/tgalal/yowsup/\n\nYowsup depends on some packages, install them as follows:\nsudo apt-get install python python-dateutil python-argparse\n\nThe commands below will download, unpack, and open the Yowsup config file.\nwget https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/archive/master.zip\nunzip master.zip\ncd yowsup-master/src\ncp config.example yowsup-cli.config\nnano yowsup-cli.config\n\nYou don't have to use nano, use an editor that you are most comfortable with. As you are editing the yowsup config file: yowsup-cli.config, find the line phone=XXXXXXXXXX, type in you phone number with country code (For example: +31612345678).\nWhen you have done that, we'll have to make the file executable: chmod +x yowsup-cli. When we are able to execute the file, we will request an authorization code:\n./yowsup-cli --requestcode sms --config yowsup-cli.config\n\nAfter you received the code - usually in the following format: \"XXX-XXX\" - we will register it:\n./yowsup-cli --register XXX-XXX --config yowsup-cli.config\n\nIt should display the information you need. In my case it displayed it immediately after running the command:\n./yowsup-cli --register 503-417 --config yowsup-cli.config\nDetected cc: 31\nstatus: ok\nkind: paid\npw: EDITED OUT\nprice: € 0,89\nprice_expiration: EDITED OUT\ncurrency: EUR\ncost: 0.89\nexpiration: 4444444444.0\nlogin: EDITED OUT\ntype: existing \n\nDon't close that terminal window. I could not find the outputted information anywhere. Copy the information from the terminal using Cntrl + Shift + C. Save it somewhere, for example in yosup.txt.\nPidgin\nNow, we will install pidgin, and the pidgin-whatsapp plugin:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:whatsapp-purple/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pidgin pidgin-whatsapp\n\nSelect the WhatsApp protocol from the drop down menu:\nYour user name is your phone number, with country code, and password is in the file you previously copied and saved. pw: longpassword. Copy them both in, click add, then you should get all the groups you're in. Again, remember, this cannot work when you also have it activated on your phone. Either desktop, or phone, but not both at the same time.\n\nThat was it. Hopefully in the future they will change the infrastructure so that both can be activated at the same time. Or even better, follow in the footsteps of Viber, and release a desktop client for Linux.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*askubuntu.com: Whatsapp Help for Ubuntu 14.04!

Using sed:\nsed -i.bak 's/`feedback`/`comments`/g' path/to/file\n\nThe -i flag makes sed perform operations in the files specified instead of writing to stdout (-isuffix makes a backup copy path/to/filesuffix).\n\nA: Try in vim:\n:%s/`feedback`/`comments`/gc\n\nthis should work as you expected\n\nA: Here's a vi/vim one-liner (using ex -s to avoid opening the full screen editor resulting in a short flash):\nex -s -c 'w %~ | %s/`feedback`/`comments`/g' -c 'x' <file>\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*w %~ saves a copy of the file with the ~ suffix. This is handy as a backup in case you mess up something.\n\n*| is the command separator.\n\n*% means \"do this action on every line\".\n\n*s/`feedback`/`comments`, as you probably already know, means \"substitute text matching the regex `feedback` with `comments` on the current line\".\n\n*g means \"global\", i.e. don't stop after the first substitution on the line.\n\n*x is a shorthand for wq, i.e. it means write the file and quit.

When running the upgrade tool (I'm currently on Ubuntu 14.04), I see \"grive\" as \"no longer needed\" and \"grive-tools\" listed for removal.\nWhy does Ubuntu have to do this? Will I have to reinstall Grive after I upgrade? That's not a major headache for me, but I just don't see why it should be listed as no longer needed and to be removed.\n\nA: Package installed are in two categories: manually installed and automatically installed. Most package that come preinstalled with Ubuntu and packages that you point to install with apt-get are manually installed. Dependencies of those packages that you did not list manually are automatically installed.\nIn your case, I guess, those packages come as dependencies to some package, that after upgrade that package does not list them as mandatory dependencies anymore. Automatically installed packages that nobody depends on anymore are called orphaned and are to be deleted on occasion.\nTo manually mark package as manual just apt-get install it. It will not do any actual difference to the system. \n", "Q: access to a web application from ubuntu 14.04 to windows 7 I have two machines in my networks business, windows and other ubuntu 14.04 which I install apache on it, from my windows machine, I want to access to a web application on the ubuntu machines, I type the ip machine ubuntu in my browser (10.1.1.177/myapp) but its not working, anyone have any idea?\n\nA: First of all the IP Address you have 10.1.1.177 is private, it means that, this can only be recognized and accessible within the same domain not from the PC which is not part of your home network. \nSo for accessing your PC from any remote site, you have to determine your Public IP address, that is, your Router's IP Address, then you have to forward your port number (which is 80 in your case, but it might be different if you manually select some other port number).

Is there a way to cat or less a .odt file just as antiword does for .doc files?\n\nA: You can browse through text without any special utility. ODT file is a renamed zip archive.

Now, this command is provided by two different packages, namely one called odt2txt that you can install with\nsudo apt-get install odt2txt \n\nand by the package unoconv (that offers also command-line conversions between more libreoffice formats), that is installed by \nsudo apt-get install unoconv\n\nIf you have the two, you can switch between them using the alternative mechanism:\nsudo update-alternatives --config odt2txt\n\nIf you are using the odt2txt provided by the package odt2txt you just use \nodt2txt file.odt\n\nif using the unoconv provided package you have to use\nodt2txt --stdout file.odt\n\nPipe them to less to have a less-like experience (odt2txt file.odt | less)  \nNotice that if you do not use the --stdout option, the unoconv-provided package will write the result in a file called  file.txt. \nThe suggested package by the distribution seems to be the one from the odt2txt package (it has a higher default priority in the alternative system); for sure it has less dependencies. \n\nA: You can't cat or less or more an .odt file because it's a binary file. It's actually - as was said earlier - a renamed .zip archive, so you have to extract the content.xml file, but that, as it implies, is an XML document, so you have to process it as such to extract the information out of it.\n\nA: It is also possible with LibreOffice's own command line tool:\nloffice --convert-to txt f.odt && less f.txt\n\n", "Q: Why does 14.10 remove Empathy?

I want to compare file1.csv and file2.csv and then copy the rows that are present in file1.csv but not in file2.csv to file3.csv. the delimiter is comma obviously\nI tried \ncomm -2 -3 file.csv file2.csv > file3.csv\n\nand I tried\ndiff -u file.csv file2.csv >> file3.csv\n\nBoth didn't work because file3 was bigger than file1 and file2. I tried different diff and comm commands, sometimes it's bigger than file2 and about the same size as file file1, I know that file3 has to be significantly  less in size than file1 and  file2. And of course I looked at file3, not the results I wanted\nAt this point, I know it could be done with diff or comm but I do not know the command to use.  \n\nA: Try this command:\n grep -v -f file2.csv file1.csv > file3.csv\n\nAccording to grep manual:\n  -f FILE, --file=FILE\n          Obtain  patterns  from  FILE,  one  per  line.   The  empty file\n          contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.   (-f  is\n          specified by POSIX.)\n\n  -v, --invert-match\n          Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.  (-v\n          is specified by POSIX.)\n\nAs Steeldriver said in his comment is better add also -x and -F that:\n  -F, --fixed-strings\n          Interpret PATTERN as a  list  of  fixed  strings,  separated  by\n          newlines,  any  of  which is to be matched.  (-F is specified by\n          POSIX.)\n  -x, --line-regexp\n          Select  only  those  matches  that exactly match the whole line.\n          (-x is specified by POSIX.)\n\nSo, better command is:\n grep -xvFf file2.csv file1.csv > file3.csv\n\nThis command use file2.csv line as pattern and print line of file1.csv that doesn't match (-v).\n\nA: In order to be able to use comm, you have to sort the lines first.\ncomm -23 <(sort file1.csv) <(sort file2.csv) > file3.csv\n\n\nA: A python option:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\ndef readfile(file):\n    with open(file) as src:\n        return [line.strip() for line in src.readlines()]\n\nlines_1 = readfile(sys.argv[1]); lines_2 = readfile(sys.argv[2])\n\nfor line in lines_1:\n    if not line in lines_2:\n        print(line)\n\nOutput:\n1,4,5,6\n1,11,13,17\n\nPaste the script into an empty file as extract.py, make it executable and run it by the command:\n<script> <file_1> <file_2>\n\nOr, to write it directly to file_3:\n<script> <file_1> <file_2> >file_3\n\n\nA: Using diff command do grep and no storing required.\nOutput if lines exist in file1 but not in file2:\n$ diff file{1,2}.csv | grep -Po \"^< \\K.*\"\n1,4,5,6\n1,11,13,17\n\nAnd output if lines exist in file2 but not in file1, with just changing left angle(<) to right angle(>):\n$ diff file{1,2}.csv | grep -Po \"^> \\K.*\"\n2,4,9,10\n13,14,17,18\n\n", "Q: Need help getting switchable graphics working under Ubuntu 14.10 According to \"Details\" (System Settings-->Details), my Sony VAIO VPC-CB15F is using only my integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics card (it says the graphics are \"Intel Sandybridge Mobile\"), however the \"Additional Drivers\" screen (System Settings-->Software & Updates-->Additional Drivers) seems to imply that I am using my AMD Radeon HD 6630M...\nYes, I have that stupid switchable graphics setup (never again, it's NVIDIA or nothing next time!).\nAnyway, the \"Additional Drivers\" screen (System Settings-->Software & Updates-->Additional Drivers) says that I using \"X.Org X Server - AMD/ATI display driver wrapper from xserver-xorg-video-ati (open source, tested)\", however I see no way to change between the two graphics cards, use only my Radeon HD 6630M (which would be preferable anyway, if it works without issue) or identify which graphics card I am currently using...\nIf anyone can give me help getting my Radeon HD 6630M working exclusively or getting the switchable crap setup again (I just did a \"clean\" install of Ubuntu 14.10), I'd be most appreciative...\n\nA: You'd better install the proprietary drivers from the release repository :\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-core fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-pxpress\nsudo ln -svT /usr/lib /usr/lib64 #Only for Ubuntu 64bits\nsudo amdconfig --initial\n\n\nnever again, it's NVIDIA or nothing next time!\n\nMy previous laptop was nvidia hybrid and it was as difficult as for amd graphic cards to configure :)\n", "Q: List of valid suid/sgid executables? Can anyone tell me where to find a list of valid suid/guid programs on Ubuntu (14.04)?\nNote I can use find to get a list of suid/sgid programs on my machine, but I want to know if they are real valid programs; is there a list I can compare them against or some other means to determine if they are valid?\n\nA: One idea - but will need a bit of work in scripting --- be my guest ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a suid/sgid file; let's call it scommand\n\n*Check from which package has been installed: \ndpkg -S /full/path/to/scommand \n\n\n*Compare its permission with the original deb package, by firstly downloading the package: \napt-get download package\n\n\n*Check if the command should have the suid set in the package with\ndpkg -c package*deb | grep /full/path/to/scommand\n\n\n*cleanup, rinse, repeat. \nExample: \n[romano:~/tmp] % ls -l /bin/passwd\nls: cannot access /bin/passwd: No such file or directory\n[romano:~/tmp] 2 % ls -l /usr/bin/passwd\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47032 Feb 17  2014 /usr/bin/passwd\n[romano:~/tmp] % dpkg -S /usr/bin/passwd\npasswd: /usr/bin/passwd\n[romano:~/tmp] % apt-get download passwd\nGet:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main passwd amd64 1:4.1.5.1-1ubuntu9 [755 kB]\nFetched 755 kB in 1s (487 kB/s)\n[romano:~/tmp] % dpkg -c passwd*.deb| grep /usr/bin/passwd\n-rwsr-xr-x root/root     47032 2014-02-17 03:42 ./usr/bin/passwd\n\ncaveat: it can happen that a file is not suid/sgid in the .deb package and that it is changed so by the installation/post-installation scripts. In that case you have to find other ways to check, maybe comparing with a fresh installation. \n\nA: This seems to work:\nIt first does an apt-cache search for every package the system can download, then downloads them all (compressed in their .deb), then loops over each file running dpkg -c to get the path and permissions of the files in the .deb files by cutting out the first three characters and looking for the suid bit to be set at the start of the line, then prints all the paths that have suid attributes.\nPKG=$(apt-cache search . | cut -f 1 -d ' ');\necho $PKG | xargs apt-get download;\nF=(`find *.deb`); for i in ${F[@]};\ndo dpkg -c $i | cut -c 4- | grep ^s | cut -c 4- | cut -f 2 -d '.'  | tee > suid_root;\ndone\n\nNote: this takes a lot of disk space to run, and isn't very optimized for speed or anything.\n", "Q: How do I use the DUALSHOCK 4 with Ubuntu 14.10? Quite simply, how do I setup, configure and use the Sony DUALSHOCK 4 controller with Ubuntu 14.10 (\"Utopic Unicorn\")?\nI remember the Linux kernel was updated a while back to add native support... Does this mean I should be able to simply pair it by bluetooth (from the notification area) and off I go?\nOr is there more to it than this?\nI tried to follow these instructions:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/450091/230107\nBut when I type sudo pip install ds4drv, I am told sudo: pip: command not found.\n\nA: Okay, all one needs to do is \"pair\" the controller just like any other bluetooth device - these instructions relate to the \"regular\" variant of Ubuntu, so adjust them accordingly if you use a different variant of Ubuntu or a different Linux-based operating system...\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the  and Share buttons to put the controller into \"pairing\" mode (the Light Bar/LED should start to rapidly blink/flash), then pair the controller with the computer using the bluetooth settings (Settings → Bluetooth → Wireless Controller).\n\n\nOnce the controller is \"paired\", you can turn it on by pressing (not holding!) the  button - do this before starting Steam or a game, because sometimes they may not recognize the controller if you do this after opening Steam or a game.\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS (\"Focal Fossa\") and newer has pseudo-official support for the DUALSHOCK 4 (it correctly recognizes the DUALSHOCK 4 as a gaming controller) and Valve Software's Steam has native/official support... Ubuntu doesn't offer anything in the way of configuration for controllers at the time of writing, but Steam has a default setup available or you can configure the controller to your individual liking - to do this, go into \"Big Picture Mode\" and adjust the \"Controller\" settings.\nA few points about what I have noticed however...\n\n\n*\n\n*Steam has surprisingly good support for the DUALSHOCK 4, and even many older games seem to work well enough... Numerous games available outside of Steam also seem to work well (such as those from GOG.com) - but it varies from game-to-game, so you'll need to experiment yourself.\n\n*If you're using \"Big Picture Mode\" and you have connected your\ncontroller in Steam, it will show a \"controller\" icon for games\nwhich support the DUALSHOCK 4 (refer to \"Tomb Raider\" in the picture below).\n\n\n*Steam will \"work its magic\" to get the DUALSHOCK 4 working as\nexpected in most games (e.g.  for\n\"select\"/\"accept\"/\"enter\" and  for\n\"cancel\"/\"decline\"/\"back\"), however some games will still show\nMicrosoft Xbox series icons, which may lead to some minor confusion.\n\n*Some games (including numerous older games) support force-feedback\n(vibration), though this varies and you may need to enable this\nfunctionality within the game itself.\n\n*Support for the \"fancy\" functionality of the DUALSHOCK 4 - such as\naccelerometer control and the touchpad - may not work in part or at\nall... I found a couple of games in Steam that supported the\naccelerometer (older games, too!), but support seems to be pretty\nmixed from game-to-game.\n\n*You can check the battery status in Ubuntu's settings (under \"Power\"); if you look in the \"Devices\" section, you should see \"Wireless Controller\" with the current battery status listed.\n\n\n*You will need to manually turn the controller off when you're\nfinished with it, by holding the  button until it\nswitches off (you should see the Light Bar/LED turn off).\n\n\nUpdated content of answer to reflect experience using Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (\"Bionic Beaver\") and the most recent version of Steam as at September 8th, 2018.\n\nA: Before typing, sudo pip install ds4drv, you need to type, sudo apt install python3-pip (or what version of python you have) …-pip.\nWithout pip installed, Ubuntu doesn't know what pip is.\n", "Q: DisplayPort monitor not detected if switched off and on again I am running Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 on a desktop PC with a Nvidia GTX 660 connected to a HP LP2475w 24\" monitor over DisplayPort.\nIt boots up fine, but if I switch off the monitor and switch it on again (for example at night) Ubuntu does not recognize the monitor at switch-on. Screen remains black, and the only way out is to reboot.\nThis is particularly annoying as I can and do switch the monitor to a different machine and back again, and the same thing happens. I have to reboot the Ubuntu machine to get the display back. Windows 8.1 manages this without an issue.\nIf I connect over DVI there is no problem; however, when I change to a 4K monitor I will need to use DP. Please help!\n\nUPDATE\nIf I have a second monitor connected using DVI, I still loose the DisplayPort monitor if I switch it off and on again, but I am able to recover it by using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then Ctrl-Alt-F7.\nIf the DisplayPort monitor is connected on its own, this method does not help. This is still a serious issue for me.\nI can't believe no-one else is having it. Anyone care to share any experiences?\nDo different graphics cards work better? Different monitors?\n\nA: I just had the same problem with a Dell u2913wm connected to a i5-5775c Iris Pro 6200 via Displayport. When I switched inputs on the monitor, it would not display an image afterwards.\nThe problem could be solved by using ssh to log into the machine and running:\nenv DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force off\nenv DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force on\n\nWhile not very practical, that would turn the screen back on.\nAfter reading the answer that mentioned turning off DDC/CI, I fiddled with my monitor settings since manually setting dpms off and on is too cumbersome. DDC/CI setting did nothing for me, but my monitor had an additional Displayport 1.2 setting that was disabled.\nAfter switching the Displayport 1.2 setting to enabled, my monitor started working again after changing inputs, or turning it off, just as it is supposed to.\n\nA: I have this same issue. However, my screen also wont sleep. So any workaround (eg. turning screen on/off) hits this issue.\nThis bug has been raised on LaunchPad:\nlaunchpad >> bug 1313539\nHowever, it is currently marked as a duplicate of a more generic bug:\nlaunchpad >> bug 1308105 (still open)\n\nUPDATE: Jan-17\nI just tried with a DVI Dual-Link cable.\nUnfortunately my video card does not support Dual-Link, only Single-Link. However, to the best of my knowledge the HP DL139A ('DMS-59 to DVI Dual-head Y-Cable') does. (Anyone else know?)\nNo issues (screen saver, screen sleep, or wakeup) under DVI, except drops to 1920x1200 resolution. Inconclusive, but issue is NOT present with same 27\" screen, and identical OS / driver setup.\n\nUPDATE: Jan-19\nNew (bigger/faster) video card still on order.\nTried with another video card, with dual DisplayPort (instead of DMS-59).\nUnfortunately the HP adapter (HP P/N 481409-220, included) is only DisplayPort to DVI Single-Link. They have another adapter (HP P/N NR078AA) that does DisplayPort to DVI Dual-Link, but it costs USD $150 (a rip off).\nNo issues (screen saver/screen sleep, or wakeup) under DVI, except drops to 1920x1200 resolution. Direct DisplayPort cable (from this card) still has same issues.\n\nUPDATE: Feb-12\nResolved for now, by moving screen close to PC and using (Samsung supplied) DVI Dual-Link cable that came with monitor.\nStill unable to use properly with DisplayPort cable.\n\nA: My solution to this was making an xbindkeys hotkey (Win+M, but you might want another one) to run the following command:\nxrandr --output DP2 --mode 3840x2160\n\nThis command will restore the video mode of the monitor when you run it.\nmode parameter here is the native resolution of my monitor, which is normally automatically chosen on boot-up when the monitor is on. You can determine the name and resolution of your output if you simply run xrandr without arguments.\nNow, if I press power button on the monitor to turn it off, and then press it again to turn it back on, I can simply type my Win+M hotkey, and the image is back on the screen.\n\nA: I had the same issues. I connect my Windows 7 PC to my Dell 2709W monitor by DisplayPort. (Nvidia GTX 750)\nI found solutions here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/630555/\nI disabled the \"DDC/CI\" in my monitor setting. This solved the problem. I hope this helps.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my ASUS laptop and Dell monitor. What I end up doing is to use xset dpms force off command to make monitor go into power saving mode, instead of turning the monitor off with its power button. I can wake up the screen by pressing a key on keyboard or moving the mouse. With this method to turn off the screen, I never run into the issue of having a black screen when I turn on the screen again. I also made a monitorOff.desktop in /usr/share/applications and pin it to launcher, so I can just click on the icon to turn off the monitor.\n\nA: I ran into something similar on a 4-Monitor configuration connected via DisplayPort to a NVidia GK107 [NVS 510] running under KUbuntu 14.04\nWhenever one of the Displays is being disabled, the other Displays will randomly rearrange their positions. When switching the Display back on this does not bring the old configuration back.\nJust recently I noticed a memory leak with SSH and \nKDE Bug 280381.\nHarshly just killing the kde4d (since I needed that memory) I noticed afterwards that the display setting stays the same. I have been able to reproduce that behavior, so I think that the problem may lie somewhere with kded4.\nUpdate:\nSince I don't think that killing the whole kded4 process is a valid option, I dug a little into the Services and found that disabling the KScreen2 Service (System Settings > Startup and Shutdown > Service Manager) solves the problem.\n\nA: I too had an issue similar to this in 14.04 with a monitor not waking up while connected to the displayport. After investigating it, it didn't seem to be an issue with the monitor.\nWhat seems to be working for me(last 24hrs) is the downgrade of xfce-settings as suggested in this bug report, posting #7\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1313539\napt-get couldn't find the downgraded package for saucy.\nI found it on launchpad.\nInstalled it via:\nsudo dpkg -i xfce4-settings_4.11.0-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb \n\nConfirmed it installed via:\nxfce4-settings-manager -V\n\nI can now have my monitor go to sleep and it seems to be waking up as expected.\n\nA: Just to add to the mix here, my best solution so far:\nDisable input auto-switching on the monitor. Lock it in to DisplayPort.\nI'm like 99% success on waking from lock screen now.\n", "Q: Terminal doesn't close with \"exit\" command after upgrade to 14.10 Upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04LTS to Ubuntu 14.10, the upgrade seems to work OK but using \"exit\" in gnome terminal just prints exit on the next line and comes back with the command line prompt.

It does not seem this is the case for this computer, though I may be wrong.

Yesterday I wanted to add ubuntu on my windows 7 pc just for the kicks of dual booting. Before I would use wubi to install ubuntu I made a 30gp partition in which I would use to install linux on. I ran wubi and installed a 7gb installation of ubuntu on my 30gb partition. After installing I got into ubuntu 12.04, upgraded it to 12.10, 13.10, and 14.04(current) no problem. Then I started to install and update drivers. I installed spotify and skype no problem, however when I went to install steam I recieved an error which stated(Steam needs at least 250mb to update). I thought to my self \"Wow that's weird, there is no way I used up 30gb already\". I passed it off as a bug. \nHowever rebooting ubuntu I noticed spotify was gone and when I started it up it failed to load. I rebooted again and went over to windows 7 and saw that a huge portion of memory was still empty and free space. Once I got back into ubuntu I saw that the space being used for ubuntu only has 6.8gb used. I don't understand, I thought I had a partition of 30gb and it isn't picking it up?

I somewhat feel that the 7gb installation has to do with why 6.8gb is fully used and not the entire partition.\n\nA: That's how Wubi works. It assumes that the host partition is being used by Windows and doesn't try to use its remaining space. Imagine if it filled up a regular partition and then Windows couldn't boot...\nSo the fact that you installed on a dedicated partition is lost on Wubi. You specified a root.disk of 7GB and that's all you get.\nIf you went to the trouble of creating a partition, then usually a normal dual boot is more suitable - in this case it would use the entire partition. \nOtherwise, you could tell Wubi to use 30GB - but the whole point of Wubi was not to have to partition, and since you've already done that, I'd go for the direct install.\nExtending the size of the root.disk\nOr you can extend the root.disk to take more of your partition, by using this guides:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeWubiDisk\nPlease note that I've personally tested the first method, but not the second (the Live resize), but I've seen a couple of posts that indicate it works. There is no edit checking so you'd have to be very careful with it.\nYou can do the safer duplicate and resize method, but that will definitely limit you to about a 23GB root.disk: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk\n", "Q: What's eating my internet bandwidth?

I cannot do it from Windows (I have only Ubuntu for now). \nSo my questions are:\nWill the disk formatted to NTFS with Ubuntu be slower than if I had formatted it to NTFS from Windows (the drivers are not the same as far as I know) ?\nOr can I just simply format to NTFS from the Windows 8 dvd ? \n\nA: The drivers might not be the same but a formatted NTFS partition is a formatted NTFS partition. What ever the tool you use. \nBy the way: The Ubuntu driver is for mounting and writing to a NTFS partition already formatted as NTFS. In general you format a disk from the GParted software, not Ubuntu itself (though you can install GParted in Ubuntu and use it from there). If the GParted NTFS formatting tool was not up to standard Windows would consider it a corrupted file system and refuse to start from it.\n\nOr can I just simply format to NTFS from the Windows 8 dvd ?\n\nThat question is off topic ... but the answer is: of course. You can format from any installation media since one of the 1st things to do is to set up your partition for a file system structure that that system needs to run on. \n\nA: No, it doesn't make a difference what OS you format your partition on, although it is generally advisable to use Windows for formatting partitions with Windows-specific file systems.\nBut: There certainly is a performance difference between using NTFS partitions on Linux and Windows. While Windows uses a native kernel driver, i.e. a very performant low-level driver, Linux uses NTFS-3G which runs in userspace, i.e. on a 'higher level', and is as such inherently slower. \nSome of these performance differences can be ameliorated by following the recommendations listed in the Tuxera NTFS-3G FAQ, the big_writes option in particular, but I haven't been able to reach Windows-level NTFS performance on Linux so far.\n\nFurther reading:\nNTFS drive mounted generates huge load\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/613869/ntfs-write-speed-really-slow-15mb-s-on-ubuntu\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/204000/are-there-faster-solutions-for-ntfs-on-linux-than-ntfs-3g\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 is slow Well...Hello\nI bought a new laptop a Dell E6430 i7 with 8 gig of ram.\nI installed 14.04 and expected it to run amazingly quick.\nMy old laptop , just an Intel dual core with 2gig of ram is so much quicker. It ran on Ubuntu 13.\nAnyone have any idea ?... I have run the updates. Do I need to re-install?\nBert\n\nA: Here are some suggestions you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the packages preload and prelink. Preload monitors which programs you start after login and prefetches the libraries of those into the RAM at login. Prelink profiles where libraries are located, so they will load faster.\n\n*Check your Graphics Card driver. If you're using a AMD or nVidia card, you could try a proprietary driver. To get an overview of available proprietary drivers, open Software & Updates, then go to the Additional Drivers tab.*\n\n*Turn down the swappiness. The swappiness is the value which defines the tendency to move unused RAM content to the SWAP partition (if any) to free more RAM. Sounds nice, doesn't it? The downside: Swapping is slow. If your computer is swapping all the time, you don't have resources left for your own. The default swappiness is 60, a value far too high on desktop systems. I've turned my swappiness down to 10, but you could even go so far to turn it down to 1, or even disable it by setting 0, if you want to.\nTo modify the swappiness, open the file /etc/sysctl.conf in your preferred text editor as root. At the bottom of the file, add the line vm.swappiness = 10 (or any other value you want to have). Ensure that another, empty line follows. Now save and reboot.\n\n*To improve boot speed, activate boot profiling. To do this, open the file /etc/default/grub in your favorite text editor as sudo, and add the word profile into the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT argument. It may look like this afterwards: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash profile\". Now save and quit the text editor. Run sudo update-grub to load the changes into the boot loader. The next boot will be a bit slower, as the boot profile is being created. Afterwards your computer should boot faster.\nIf neither of above steps helps, it might be problems with some other component of your computer. Finding out which one will be a tough job... And even if you find out, there is no guarantee that there's a (better) device driver for Linux.\n\n*If you're using a AMD Accelerated CPU, you have to install the fglrx driver in order to let the system manage the CPU speed. Else the CPU will stay at it's lowest possible speed. \n\nA: Is this your only installation on your Laptop ? If not how much is that partition , and what kind of Hard Disk do you use ? Do you have the right drivers installed ? I have found that in some cases that something as simple as free-space available , especially in a smaller partition can make a big difference in performance. I used to run ubuntu 14.04 fairly slow when i had a 20GB HDD partition with around 6GB of Swap space. Once i expanded it out to 150GB it was just much quicker. Im not sure if this is something causing an apparent lag . Also the other answers are very true (SWAP space / Drivers) . \nAlso , this might be obvious , but you do need to make sure you have the 64bit flavor :).\n\nA: Check you CPU speed stepping ; I had strange issues with ondemand mode and it sticking on low power too much -- in my case I use mains so performance mode sorted it.

If so, you might want to consider adding the Xorg-edgers PPA, which can provide that bleeding edge experience with purpose built .debs for install.\nAs to your particular issue, do you have DKMS and/or the kernel headers installed locally? If you do not, you will need to install them in order to build the kernel modules for the driver and have it installed successfully.\nHTH.

For security purposes, I tested that and I got this:\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nnori:x:1000:1000:Nori,,,:/home/nori:/bin/bash\n\nNow, I would like to know, why there is a root user? I thought I only created 1 user.\nAlso, please note that after installing Ubuntu, my friends (who also use Linux, but not Ubuntu) told me to create a root password (which is different from the user password).\nEDIT: To add the root password, I used the sudo -i, and then I used the passwd to create a new password.\nThank you for the help, and sorry if this question have already been answered.\n\nA: All linux systems have a root user; that is the user responsible for starting all kind of services. \nIn Debian based systems (like Ubuntu is) root itself disabled and we use a \"sudo\" system where a normal user gets elevated permissions by entering the admin password. \nYou can see the root prompt when you enter with your admin user: \nsudo su\n\nand the admin password for your user. Example:\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ sudo su\n[sudo] password for rinzwind: \nroot@schijfwereld:/home/rinzwind# \n\nMind you: using it is discouraged; if you use it to access nautilus it is possible to break your system since some files depend on being owned by your user (and not root) and can be changed to root when changing the file. \n\nA: Root is the superuser of your PC. Generally the user created during install is an administrator but doesn't have the privileges to run system level tasks. These admin users though have the permission to request the system altering commands from the Root using the sudo command. \nAny other user doesnt even have the permission to request sudo permission from the root. Your user name should be part of sudoers file to be able to do so.\n", "Q: Opening Kubuntu DVD in Windows (EFI) gives message \"Wubi doesn´t currently support EFI\" After downloading an iso-image for Kubuntu 14.10 and then burning it to a DVD. When I then tried to open it I get this message:\n\nWhat to do ?\nCan anyone please help.\n\nA: This is a new patch to Wubi introduced with Ubuntu 14.10 that spares users such as yourself who have computers with EFI firmware from installing Wubi only to find that it doesn't work. What used to happen is that the install would have appeared to succeed (in Windows), sometimes after downloading 1GB of data, only to find upon rebooting an error message about wubildr.mbr being corrupted.\nNow Wubi checks and helpfully refuses to install, thus saving you a lot of pain. Do a normal dual boot as suggested here: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nNote:\nWubi.exe is also set to autorun when you insert an (K)Ubuntu DVD in Windows. Even if you don't intend to install Kubuntu using Wubi it will autorun and then terminate with this popup on EFI computers. \n\nA: See the forum staff recommendations for WUBI at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2229766.

They are all connected to the same WiFi network.\nAll Owner A's PCs must act like they are connected to the same LAN, but not have any access to any of Owner B's PCs, and visa versa. They all must have internet access.\nHow can I configure such a setup on Ubuntu Server? And would I have to have two NICs (One connected to the WAN and the other to the LAN). Is there any specific switches needed?\nI have tried to look for the answer myself, but all I can find is using static IPs. I cannot fix any of the users' IPs.\n\nA: I would suggest that you uses two different SSID for each owner.  Then you can set up good enough security of their WLAN (WiFi).  Give each SSID an own network, like Owner A 192.168.10.0/24 and Owner B 192.168.20.0/24.  \nAfter that, you can set up the router to route between them and controll access with a firewall between the two networks.  Basicly exchange the VLAN with the SSID.  If you want to use wired network, you set up a switch in the router and bridge the SSID with the right switch.\nI do belive that there can be problems with VLAN over WLAN.  But my memory could be wrong there.\n", "Q: Can I download and run ubuntu directly from computer without blank CD or USB stick? I have no blank disc or USB stick. Can I download and run Ubuntu directly to computer?\n\nA: You can run it from within a VirtualBox or VMware.\nWriting the entire how-to use would be too long and quite trivial. There are many tutorials available in the internet on the installation instruction and how to use either of the software to run a guest OS(Ubuntu which you want to try out) inside a host OS(Ubuntu/Windows/any other OS that you are running now), an example being here.\nFurther explanation:\nVirtualBox is an virtualization software which installs on an existing host operating system as an application; this host application allows additional guest operating systems(in your case, ubuntu), each known as a Guest OS, to load and run, each with its own virtual environment.You just need to allocate some free space where the application will create a vitual HDD and let you run ubuntu even when inside your current operating system.\n\nA: There is an official, suggested method to install and try Ubuntu from your existing system, without using slow and virtualized solutions like Virtualbox.\nIf you use Win 7, Vista, XP or 2000, Ubuntu can be installed like any Windows application with Wubi (official website and guide).\n\nWubi is an officially supported installer for Windows XP, Vista and\n  7 users that allows Ubuntu to be installed and uninstalled in a safe,\n  easy way as with any other Windows application. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*from wiki.ubuntu.com, the official Ubuntu wiki.\n\n\nWindows will not be altered or damaged and you'll be able to remove Ubuntu by uninstalling it, like any application. The experience with this installation method is very similar to the normal Ubuntu and the full procedure can be performed online or offline; the disk management will be a bit slower in a Wubi's Ubuntu installation but the rest is exactly like in a normal Ubuntu Linux OS.\nClick here (uptodown.com) to download Wubi.\nOf course, if you need Ubuntu for work or for long-term use, an installation from DVD should be better.\nIf you can't follow the official guide linked before, use this unofficial guide (howtogeek.com) which will show how to installa Wubi's Ubuntu (for common machines) and Wubi's Kubuntu (for high-end systems).\nPlease, comment down here if you have more inherent questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow if I'm of any help.\n\nHave a nice experience with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I add categories to a scope? I'm playing around with the Ubuntu SDK. At the moment I'm trying to create a Unity 8 Scope. Currently I'm stuck with the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I add categories to the scope (the selection list above the results, see Amazon Scope)\n\n\nUnfortunately I didn't find any useful information in the developer docs.\n\nA: The drop down above the results is the department selector.  Categories are the different groups of items in a scope's results, which is why you might have had trouble finding the correct API.\nTo add departments to your scope, you should call register_departments on the reply object in your query class's run method.  This takes a unity::scopes::Department::SCPtr object representing the set of departments visible for this particular set of results:\n\n\n*\n\n*if the user is currently browsing the top level department, you should pass a Department representing the top level, with its immediate children filled in.\n\n*If the user is browsing a sub-department, you should pass a Department representing the parent, with its immediate children filled in.  The current department must appear within the children.\nThe idea is that only those parts of the department tree needed for immediate navigation are provided.  Your code might look something like this:\nDepartment::SPtr parent = Department::create(\"parent\", query(), \"Parent Dept\")\nparent->set_subdepartments({\n    Department::create(\"sibling\", query(), \"Sibling department\"),\n    Department::create(\"current\", query(), \"Current departmnet\")});\nreply->register_departments(parent);\n\nNow all you need to do is make your scope provide results relevant to the department selected by the user.  This is made available in your query class as query().department_id().  This will match the ID of one of the departments you've previously registered, or \"\" which should be treated as the top level department.\n", "Q: Borderlands 2 will only starts in a small window - Ubuntu 14.04 64bit I was having trouble running Borderlands 2 on a newly imaged Ubuntu 14.04 64bit install. \n\n\n*\n\n*The machine is a Lenovo X1 Carbon.\n\n*I had trouble with the libopenal1 error, but was able to fix it.\n\n*I've ran all system updates and upgrades.\n\n*I installed the Intel graphics driver using their Intel Graphics\nUpdate software, then rebooted.\nNow when the game starts the screen is black except for a small box where the game intro shows and the main menu.

The video in the box looks good, no discoloration or distortions. I am at a loss, does anyone have any ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: I have the exact same issue for Borderlands The Pre-Sequel with a Nvidia graphic card, same OS. \nThe problem actually occurs only in full screen mode, I set the game in window mode and it is fine now.\nTo avoid restarting your computer everytime, you can just connect to another virtual session (Ctrl + Alt + F1), kill the process and go back to the virtual session running your X server (Ctrl +Alt + F7 for me).\n\nA: You can also edit the graphics window sizes in the willowgame subdirectoriess, in the .ini files, search for ResX and ResY and set them to your actual screen size.\n", "Q: SSH installation errors Please let me know what to be done here.

On my development machine, I have /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.20; on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 I have /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.19.  I'm taking my first baby steps into creating a DEB file to install my application, and it works to install the app itself, now I would like my DEB file to also install the necessary shared libraries (like libstdc++.so.6.0.20).\nThe library is installed from package libstdc++6, but the default repositories don't have the right version, I have to add the ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test repository to get the right version.\nIt seems like I need to add the line\nDepends: libstdc++6:amd64 (= 4.9.2-0ubuntu1~14.04)\n\nto my DEBIAN/control file, but it seems like that can't work without also telling it about the repository, and I can't figure out how to do that.\nOr am I barking up the completely wrong tree?  I guess I'm assuming that if I correctly set up a dependency on libstdc++6, it will go out to the Internet and download it for me, as part of my DEB installer?\nThanks,\nChris\np.s. My DEB installer will only be used in-house, it will be copied onto the target machine from a USB stick or similar, it will never be downloaded from the Internet ...\n\nA: A package can depend on any version of another package, but the package management system will only be able to install that dependency if it is in the enabled repositories. So you will have to add that PPA to the target system before installing your package.Your installation instructions will look like this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:...\nsudo apt-get update\n# Followed by preferred means of installing your package \n\nAlso checkout How can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)? to see ways of setting up a small repository on the USB drive, so that all the dependencies are included in it directly without having to add a PPA.\n(You shouldn't have to specify the architecture in the dependency, by the way.) \n", "Q: Disable all Logs I use my Ubuntu vps with openvpn as a surf proxy.\nFor security and privacy reasons i want to disable all logs on the \nserver.

The installation appeared to work in Windows, and told me to reboot. \nAfter rebooting the Ubuntu installer continued the installation, until it stopped with an error message: Failed to partition the selected disk with the detail This probably happened because are too many primary partitions in the partition table.\n\nA: This is a bug with the wubi.exe released with 14.10. Or to be precise it's a bug in one of the programs used byubiquity (the Ubuntu installer). Normally bugs can be fixed, but typically Wubi is never patched mid-release so this bug will remain for the full life-cycle of Ubuntu 14.10.\nSo, if you have tried to install Ubuntu with Wubi 14.10, it doesn't work and cannot be fixed with any known manual workaround.\nGo to the Add/Remove programs in the Control Panel in Windows, and double click on the Ubuntu entry to completely uninstall Wubi.\nUpdate\nThere is now a manual workaround from hakuna_matata that is of medium to high difficulty.

I'll post it and you can do it if you're feeling adventurous.\nThere are two ways I did this but I can't guarantee that they will work for you simply because I still consider myself a newbie and I did this by following other people's guides.\nWARNING: This includes compiling a custom kernel.Make sure to have at least one or more older kernels installed just in case something goes wrong!\n\nFirst (easy) way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the kernel source from The Linux Kernel Archives. Just click on the \"Latest stable kernel\" button.\n\n*Extract the archive: open the terminal and navigate to where you downloaded the kernel and run this command: tar -xvJf linux-\"KernelVersion\".tar.xz (replace \"KernelVersion\" with the version number of the downloaded kernel).\n\n*This will create a new folder usually named linux-\"KernelVersion\" (again, this is the version number of the downloaded kernel). Enter that folder, then navigate to drivers > hid. You should now be in /path/to/download/linux-\"KernelVersion\"/drivers/hid.\n\n*Edit the hid-ids.h file with your favourite text editor: gedit hid-ids.h or nano hid-ids.h or kate hid-ids.h\n\n*In  the text editor, navigate to the line that says (should be around line 520-530): \n\n#define USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X  0x5011\n\n\n*Edit the line so it looks like this:\n\n#define USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X  0x501a\n\n\n*Save and exit. Now it's time to compile the kernel.\nYou can find many guides for compiling the kernel online, so I think it would be better to refer you to one than to write the guide myself. I found this article most helpful. Read the article carefully and be careful about the configuration.\nWith this fix, everything worked perfectly, the only thing bugging me was that xinput now listed several Genius MousePen i608X devices.\n\nSecond (hard) way:\nThis way is harder in the sense that you will have to edit few more files. This is the way described in the patch you mention.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow steps 1 - 3 from the first way.\n\n*Edit the hid-core.c file like this:\n\n\nNavigate to the chunk of code that looks like this: \n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_GILA_GAMING_MOUSE) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_MANTICORE) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_GX_IMPERATOR) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_ERGO_525V) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_EASYPEN_I405X) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_EASYPEN_M610X) },\nAnd change it to this:\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_GILA_GAMING_MOUSE) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_MANTICORE) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_GENIUS_GX_IMPERATOR) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_ERGO_525V) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_EASYPEN_I405X) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X) },\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X_2) }, //add this\n    { HID_USB_DEVICE(USB_VENDOR_ID_KYE, USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_EASYPEN_M610X) },\n\n\n*Edit the hid-ids.h similarly to the first way, but instead of editing that one line, add this line after it:\n\n\n\n#define USB_DEVICE_ID_KYE_MOUSEPEN_I608X_2 0x501A\n\n\n\n*Edit the hid-kye.c file like this:\n\n\nFind this chunk of code:\n/*\n * See EasyPen M610X description, device and HID report descriptors at\n * http://sf.net/apps/mediawiki/digimend/?title=KYE_EasyPen_M610X\n */\n\nand before it, add this:\n\n/* Original MousePen i608X report descriptor size */\n#define

In this case, I removed the Remmina Desktop Client (I think, if it comes with Ubuntu). \nSo, my question is if there's any problem by removing this program (I never use remote desktop), and also, does removing them improve my security?\nThabk you guys for helping me.\n\nA: \nSo, my question is if there's any problem by removing this program (I never use remote desktop), \n\nNo.\n\nAnd also, does removing them improve my security?\n\nNo. Ubuntu is shipped as secure as possible. If Remmina would be a security problem by just being installed it would have been removed from our installation. And any Linux system for that matter. Security is not taken lightly in Linux installations.\nIn general: you need to have vulnerable services exposed to the internet for someone to enter your systen. So for someone to abuse Remmina to access your system it 1st needs to be active (it is not when not running).\n\nIf you are concerned about this I would approach this from another point of view: your 1st line of defense is your router. Check that 1st for possible security holes. Like: is there any forwarding that does not need to be there. Update your router software (I installed DD-WRT on mine). Enable logging on the router and if possible enable alert/mail messages.\nAnd on your Ubuntu system check for running services and disable them if you do not need them. In a default Ubuntu there are not a lot of services to disable though. \n\nAnd of course it is always good to think about the value of your system to other people. If you have a normal desktop system it should not be of interest unless you pissed someone off really bad and they want to target you specifically. If you have a system with several webshops running on it security needs to be one of the main priorities. Those might be targetted by automated scripts. \n", "Q: what should I do...?

If I do it like this:\n2>&1 nginx -V | tr -- - '\\n'\n\nit works. But why?\n\nA: What you're observing indicates that nginx -V writes its output to the standard error stream (aka stderr - on file descriptor 2) rather than the standard output stream (aka stdout - file descriptor 1). Only stdout gets passed through the pipe | so your tr command doesn't receive it.\nThe 2>&1 syntax tells the shell to redirect stderr to stdout so that it then gets piped to tr. FYI the placement you have used is syntactically legal but unconventional - most often that kind of redirection would be written as \nnginx -V 2>&1 | tr -- - '\\n'\n\nBTW the pipe | is really redirecting the output of the first command rather than the input of the second, which is coming from the standard input stream (stdin - file descriptor 0) as usual.\n", "Q: Oracle Java 8 \"This plug-in is not supported\" I had Java 7 working nicely on Ubuntu 14.04.

That eats up a lot of CPU and is time consuming.\nPlease give some alternative on how I can remove multiple packages, preferably in GUI, but commands would do too.\n\n\nA: Well you could try and remove them from terminal. It seems that all the files you want to remove start with fonts-tlwg so you could do:\nsudo apt-get remove fonts-tlwg-*\n\nAnd that does the trick.\n\nA: first install synaptic, it's a software manager like software center by this command\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nor install it from software center, after installing open synaptic from main menu, enter your password, from the top bar press search and enter your keyword, then select all, right click and mark for removal, in the end click apply.\n\nA: If you want a GUI, install synaptic package manager which allows you to add/remove multiple packages.\n", "Q: Software-Center Error Software center does not work for me.

I couldn't boot Ubuntu either. I thought everything was lost. So then I used Ubuntu live USB which I had and chose to \"Try Ubuntu before installing\"  and performed boot repair and finally I could get Ubuntu working. (finally relieved that something was working). Then I added windows option to the Ubuntu grub menu. I got windows 8 loader option in the grub while booting but same error when I select it. I googled a lot but found no solution and I  gave up. But finally after a few days I realized something and tried it. It worked right.\nTHE  SOLUTION  : EasyBCD actually creates a backup of your BCD file. (or you would have been prompted to create one when you run the software)\nI could access windows files from the drive in Ubuntu. Then I searched for the location where easybcd was installed and  and found backups of the bcd file. (gave me little hope that something could be possibly done) \nThen I went to the folder \"Root\" of windows and found a file named BCD. I copied the file to other directory (just in case if I needed  it later).\nThen I removed the BCD File (I didn't know if it was advisable to do it) and copy pasted the .bcd backup file into  the root folder.(The file had a name like EasyBCD Backup(-date-).bcd    )\nThen I renamed the file as BCD ( same as the one I deleted) without the extensions .bcd  (the file I deleted was plainly called BCD)\nAfter that restarted the laptop and chose the windows option from the grub and............ To my surprise..................  it worked. \nIt was a great relief as I was very new to all these things and had completely lost hope. \n\nA: I suffered from the same issue and have fixed it properly. I followed the instructions from Windows:\n\n*\n\n*Create a USB boot of your Windows (the same as your current Windows).\n\n\n*Access the boot menu and choose to boot from USB.\n\n\n*Choose the language and go to next, then click Repair your computer.\n\n\n*go to Troubleshoot, then cmd, and type the following commands.\n bootrec /rebuildbcd\n bootrec /fixmbr\n bootrec /fixboot\n\nI hope you can fix your problem.\n\nA: Have you checked correct settings using Recovery Center?

This error can occur because Microsoft True Type Core Fonts for the web, which is installed by the ttf-mscorefonts-installer, is Microsoft proprietary software,  and although it can be installed free of charge, it cannot be installed without accepting the Microsoft End User License Agreement (EULA). The problem is that the Microsoft EULA window pops up behind the Ubuntu Software Center window, and since it is smaller than the Ubuntu Software Center window, it is often completely covered up so that it can't be seen. Then when you close the Ubuntu Software Center window, it also closes the EULA window, resulting in the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package being 'half-installed'.\nIf this happened to you, then you have to uninstall the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package and reinstall it, preferably from the terminal, so that the EULA window won't have any big windows to hide behind.\nRun sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer and accept the EULA, or else if you already have ttf-mscorefonts-installer installed and you didn't accept the EULA, then uninstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer and reinstall it like this:  \nsudo dpkg -P ttf-mscorefonts-installer  \nsudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer  \n\nUse the Tab and Enter keys to accept the EULA in the Microsoft TrueType core fonts window that pops up. The terminal will output a new message each time it finishes downloading a new font. Wait a bit until the terminal tells you that it's finished downloading and installing the Microsoft TrueType core fonts.\n\nIf this method doesn't work, then  download the latest version of ttf-mscorefonts-installer and double-click it to install it using the Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Drag and Drop in VMWare I installed LXDE desktop on Ubuntu 14.04 in VMWare.

This is the same as it is used in Xubuntu. Therefore all guides on how to customize our desktop on Xfce or Xubuntu will be applicable too.\nCustomizing the Xfce-panel\nFor a quick access to favorite applications we can add any number of Xfce panels on right click on the top panel, then select Panel > Panel Preferences..... Below example shows preferences for the bottom panel (red dashes):\n\nAll system wide installed applications will have a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications. These can be viewed using the file manager:\n\nBy simply dragging & dropping the icon of any application to the bottom panel we can create a launcher there for quick access.\nAlternatively we can also drag & drop the icons on our desktop, or in a newly created folder on our desktop if that met our workflow. Mark .desktop files as \"executable\" when in a desktop folder:\n\nAdd another desktop environment\nOf course you can add another desktop manager to your Ubuntu Studio installation in case any of them feels more comfortable to you. For an exemplatory guide on how to install Unity (my favourite default Ubuntu desktop manager) on top of Ubuntu Studio see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use other Desktop environment in Ubuntu-Studio and exchange whenever I want?, Xfce to Unity & Vise\nOther launcher applications\nIn addition, you may just want to install an alternative application launcher to ease access to your applications.

This list is by no means meant to be complete or give any recommendations - it is all personal preferences that matter.\n\n\n*\n\n*Whisker \nWhisker can be added as Applications Menu to the panel. It provides a search function for an  application (by name, description, or category) similar to the Xfce Application Finder, but it additionally gives access to recently used or favorite applications.\n \n\n*Cairo Dock \nCairo Dock is a highly customizable Mac-style dock with  a lot of eye-candy to add application launchers or file locations in a free to place and configure panel.

I propose to do a full reinstall, but want to backup the Thunderbird inbox for reinserting if it is otherwise lost in the process. This web access is from a trial version of 14.04 on DVD, and 'backups' is available. The HDD is shown on the desktop as a mass storage device, within which all the system folders appear to be accessible. What do I have to do to pull out the inbox (at least) and transfer it (or a copy) to an external mass storage device.\nThanks for any help,\nDerek F. \n\nA: I am assuming you mixed up and are referring to thunderbird, based on your tags. Guessing from your description, opening your HDD shoud show a folder home. Enter it and you should see your username. Enter it and press Ctrl+H, locate .thunderbird and copy it over to external storage.\nYour home should be the folder home/<username> on whichever drive your Ubuntu was installed. Thunderbird stores all its data in .thunderbird in your home. By default files and folders starting with a . are hidden, you can press Ctrl+H to toggle showing hidden files from the file browser.\nOn a fresh install, copy it to your home folder before starting up thunderbird for the first time and it should automatically reuse all settings and downloaded email.\nI'm assuming you located your hard disk and an external drive to copy files to.\ncp -r /path/to/harddisk/user/<username>/.thunderbird /path/to/externaldisk/thunderbird-backup\n\nIf it fails, try sudo. You may have to correct permissions after restoring, though. To restore it, run:\ncp -r /path/to/externaldisk/thunderbird-backup ~/.thunderbird\n\n\nA: If you wish to do that via terminal you do the following:\ncd ~\ncp -r .thunderbird thunderbird-backup\n\nAfter that you can see and move thunderbird-backup directory anywhere you want.\n", "Q: How can I (from CLI) assign multiple IP addresses to one interface?

I want to create a boot USB stick to test Ubuntu to make sure it will run on an old laptop (IBM ThinkPad with no operating system and no CD capability) I was given.  \nHow can I download direct to a USB stick via a Windows 7 PC? It's a friend's PC so I don't want to do anything on that machine, just use it to download the ISO and prepare the LiveUSB.\n\nA: I don't think you can download \"direct to USB\" but you can download the ISO then download a simple exe which will create the bootable USB using the ISO.  I always use the tools found at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/\nSpecifically if you just want to put one ISO one a USB you will want \"Universal USB Installer\". Very fast, very easy, no need to install anything.\n\nA: To create a LiveUSB drive, from an ISO source image, you normally use a specialized application. This is because USB boot drives use the hard disk boot standard, and ISO's are prepared to use the CD boot standard.  Ubuntu ISO's are actually hybrid images, so they can boot once written by either standard.\nSo if you wanted to do this from Windows, without installing something, you could run something as a portable app.\nCheck out http://rufus.akeo.ie/, it's a portable app called Rufus.  It's often used for this type of situation. I also found a blog entry about your use case, http://bootableusb.net/install-windows-ubuntu-usb-drive-using-rufus/\n\nA: Well, which Ubuntu do you want? \nThe Ubuntu desktop installer with the Unity desktop environment is freely downloadable as an ISO file, but you may wish to look at other versions of *buntu, especially since your destination machine, that old IBM-vintage ThinkPad, may be a little slow with Unity. Other official distributions you may consider are listed at Wikipedia, and include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu\n\n*Lubuntu  <--- what I use on my Lenovo Thinkpad R60\n\n*Ubuntu GNOME (click the Download link on the menu bar)\n\n*Xubuntu\nAll of those use less memory and respond faster than the Unity desktop environment in the official Ubuntu distribution. This is especially useful if your old Thinkpad's RAM is less than 2GB.\n\nOnce you have decided which you want to use, download its ISO file. Download the 32-bit version, since your IBM ThinkPad is old and may not have the RAM recommended for 64-bit versions of *buntu. (We can talk about changing to 64-bit later, once we have it up and running in 32-bit).\nWhen you have its 32-bit ISO file completely downloaded, then we follow the official Ubuntu instructions at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n\nStep Zero is to download and install a small, and harmless, app on the Windows PC. The app, the Universal USB Installer, allows you to turn a USB flashdrive into a LiveUSB.  (I recommend using at least a 2GB flashdrive, although some of the versions above will let you use a smaller flashdrive. A larger flashdrive is AOK.)\nOnce the Universal USB Installer is downloaded and installed in Windows, Step One is to launch that app, and choose the version of *buntu you downloaded.\nStep Two: Click on Browse to find the ISO file you downloaded for it, and Open it.\nStep Three: Choose the drive letter for your USB Flashdrive, and click on Create.\nStep Four: Once created, close this app, and then in the Windows Desktop, in the Tray at lower right down by the clock, click on the USB icon and safely remove the flashdrive.\nStep Five: Plug the Flashdrive into the IBM, and power up. Press {F12} to call up the list of bootable devices, and choose the USB Flashdrive. \nIf the Flashdrive does not appear, then power off, power back up, and press {F1} to go into the ThinkPad BIOS, and there configure the ThinkPad so the USB FlashDrive is a bootable device, then save the change, reboot, and press {F12} to pick the flashdrive for booting. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStickQuick#Start_the_Ubuntu_installer provides extra detail on this.\n\nStep Six: You now have booted from the LiveUSB, which will give you the choice of running *buntu from that Live USB drive, or installing *buntu on your hard drive. Running from the LiveUSB is AOK; it lets you 'try before you buy', and experiment to see which version of *buntu you like the best. \nStep Seven: Once you know which you like, then click on the installer, which will ask you several commonsense questions, and then reboot the PC. When the screen goes blank in the reboot process, remove the USB Flashdrive, and your ThinkPad will boot into your brand new *buntu from your hard drive. \n", "Q: 14.04 Keyboard Ctrl-L, Super-L, Alt-L register as Shift L for some reason I seem to be having this strange keyboard problem where when I press either buttons Ctrl+L, Super+L, Alt+L, they all individually register as Shift+L.

The driver you see from D-Link's site is actually from the chip manufacturer, Realtek, and is in no way 'official' on D-Link's site.\nFurther, the entirety of Linux, including Ubuntu, gets the drivers from Realtek as well.

Is there a way to perform an integrity check on a ready-to-use USB boot disk?\nI just made a Lubuntu 14.04.01 boot USB, and have not been able to figure out how to run an integrity check on it.  I can't find any .iso file to run an MD5sum hash against.\n\nA: My answer is based on Lucas's answer in Unix and Linux StackExchange. To check the integrity of a usb boot disk, first find the size of the iso image with\n stat -c '%s' imagename.iso \n\nThis will output an image size which you can enter in place of <imagesize> in the command below.\nThe next command sends (through a pipe) all bytes corresponding to the size of the image to the md5sum command :\nsudo head -c <imagesize> /dev/sdb1 | md5sum\n\nYou can compare this with the md5sum of your .iso file.\nmd5sum imagename.iso\n\nIf md5sums are different then there was an issue while copying the data. If md5sums are the same, you have successfully checked data integrity on your usb disk!\nNote on locating your usb device under /dev/\nFor the command above, you need to know the name of your usb device such as /dev/sdbX, not the mount point (such as /media/usbX). You can find out by looking at the column Filesystem, in the output of df. For example my usb device appears as /dev/sdb1 in the output of \ndf\n\n\nA: You can find the md5sum of an Ubuntu iso here.\nThe above md5 value is the checksum of the entire disk, not of the individual files.\nWhen you prepare a bootable USB, the files from the iso file are copied over to the USB and the bootloder of the USB is overwritten, thus making it bootable. You see here, a single file(for ex, lubuntu 14.04.1 x64 iso) with a md5 sum(a5f97cd6a9f171c70cf816de8728f13b) is now destroyed and multiple files are present in the USB instead. So you don't have an iso anymore to compare the original lubuntu iso's md5 sum to.\nIf you want to check the integrity of each of the individuals files, then you need to boot from the USB and then select check cd for defects from the boot menu. There's a file ms5sum.txt in each ubuntu iso which contains the md5sum of each individual file in the iso. The check cd for defects option verifies the md5sum of each file with the md5 list present in the iso.\nFrom LiveWireBT's answer, just navigating into the usb drive and running md5sum -c md5sum.txt should perform a consistency check of the individual files.\n\nA: Hashes of individual files contained in the ISO image are stored in the root folder as md5sum.txt.\nRunning md5sum -c md5sum.txt in the same folder should perform a consistency check.\n\nA: head -c $(stat -c imagename.iso) /dev/sdX | sha256sum\nSimilar to paul-rougieux's answer, but it gets the size of the ISO and performs the hash check in a single command\n\nA: In the code below, change X into the path to the (iso-)image, you can check this by:\nls -AFl Documents/tails.ISO  # X would be Documents/tails.ISO\nAnd change Y into the right device identifier for the USB drive. You can check with lsblk while it is not plugged in versus when it is plugged in to make sure you have the right device name (usually something like /dev/sdZ).\nThe code to check whether what has been written to the USB drive corresponds to the image file used (in the bash shell!):\nimg='X' usb='Y'\n[[ $(head -c $(stat -c '%s' \"$img\") \"$usb\" |sha256sum) = $(sha256sum <\"$img\") ]] &&\n  echo OK ||\n  echo ERROR\n\nIf you use a tool like GNU ddrescue (the package is often called gddrescue), you could write: ddrescue --force 'X' 'Y' and it would automatically verify whether it was correctly written!\nNote that by plugging the USB stick in and out, some partitions in the written image could get automatically mounted and thereby modified (the 'dirty bit') causing it to produce a completely different checksum!!\n\nA: Don't know whether the Linux Mint ISO uses the same grub menu as the vanilla Ubuntu ISO, but I'm just installing now and the grub menu that comes up has: \ncheck the integrity of the medium \nwhich took 10 mins to run and found 69 errors.

I eventually managed it, although I am sure some of the files were missing or something like that.\nEventually I got curious about Ubuntu last year and gave it a try.\nNow because (I think) of these files or drivers or whatnot missing, the update popup for 14.10 always would pop-up, and then ask for my password so it could go forward with the upgrade.\nThe upgrade was going fine, and I just locked my PC only to come back and being unable to do anything except look at the lock screen and wave my mouse around.

I copied the .ISO file to the USB. I have also gone into the BIOS and set it to boot to USB first. I've also disabled QuickBoot and Enabled F12 for Boot Options. When it boots, I hit F12. I'll select the USB I want to boot from and the computer will then start loading Windows; no error or anything. I even tried converting the .ISO to .IMG and it still didn't work. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I've checked other forums and none of those seem to help. I'd appreciate any advice.\n\nA: Simply copying over the iso to the usb doesn't make it bootable. You need to use an application like pendrivelinux or unetbootin to make a bootable USB.\nThese tools extract the individual files from the iso and copy them to the USB and then overwrite the bootloader of the usb itself, thus making it bootable.\nThe above activity will erase all data from your USB drive. backup the data from the usb\n\nA: I have the same problem but i fix it by this program  Universal USB Installer\nand remember to make the boot from external device enable some laptop need this option like my laptop.... :)      \n\nA: I had a moment in life where my both PC and notebook OS were not booting and found an easy solution for my problem.\nIf you have root on your Android phone, get an app called \"DriveDroid\" from the Play Store.

I was taking a look at my .bash_history, and I found a blank line.\nI thought that I could have pressed \"enter\" while I was taking a look in the file.\nIs that normal? Or maybe I really pressed enter while looking the file on gedit?\nEDIT: Just found today that I have more than one line break. That's strange, I never edit the .bash_history file.\n\nA: This is not a problem, it is not dangerous and is entirely normal. You can get such lines if you hit space a few times and then hit enter. This will be saved in your history (since it is a non-blank line, spaces are characters just invisible ones). \nTo test this, we can use a command that prints the blank lines in bash's history For example, this grep will match all lines that start with numbers and then have 0 or more whitespace (spaces or tabs or whatever) and nothing else until the end of the line:\nhistory | grep -P '^\\s*\\d+\\s*$'\n\nThat should show you a list of empty commands you have run. Now, run ( the first line means hit space a few times, then enter)\n$ echo foo\nfoo\n$       \n$ history  | tail -n 3\n$ history | tail -n 3\n80  echo foo\n81               ## this is the blank line\n82  history | tail -n 3\n\nYou will notice that you have a new blank line. In conclusion, don't worry. everything is fine and this is normal.\n\nA: As mentioned by terdon, those are likely whitespace only lines.\nThere are two environment variables options that control whether whitespace lines are stored in the history or not:\n\n\n*\n\n*HISTCONTROL: if it contains ignorespace, then any line that starts with a whitespace is ignored.\n\n*HISTIGNORE: colon separated list of pattens to ignore. For example, if it contains:\nHISTIGNORE=' *'\n\nthen lines that start with a single space will be ignored.\nI was not able to make bash store truly empty lines without whitespace.\n\nA: Here is an explanation about how blank lines can occur in the .bash_history file.\nIn brief:\n\nIf you call from the history a command line that you have actually typed earlier in that same current terminal session and then edit it (maybe deleting it) but then interrupt your edit by leaving that (history-)command line using for instance the Down arrow to come back to the prompt of the actual current command line, then when later on you exit the terminal the edits get recorded in the .bash_history file.\n\n", "Q: Space bar plays music or video My ubuntu used to play music or vids by pushing the space bar while the cursor is over the file.

I have them all hooked up and working, but when I try to rotate them to get the desired arrangement, suddenly I'm unable to drag the displays close to each other in the display manager. This forces there to be a gap between the 3 displays.\nHas anyone else encountered this problem, and if so is there a workaround? And if not, is there a different program I can use to do this?\n\nA: Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, I was able to reproduce your problem using both unity-control-center (the default \"System Settings\" manager for Ubuntu) and mate-display-properties (which implements \"Monitor Preferences\" for the MATE desktop alternative).  If you just rotate the displays, it won't let you simply drag them closer together -- seems like a bug, maybe this one.\nI was able to work around the issue by just messing around a bit (after setting the desired orientation).  Here's a sequence that seems to work (given my particular starting arrangement):\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag display 3 to sit below and diagonal to display 1.\n\n*Drag display 2 to sit adjacent to display 1.\n\n*Drag display 3 to sit adjacent to display 2.\n\n\nIt's like some kind of sliding puzzle, where you can't go directly from the beginning to the end, but instead have to transition through intermediate \"legal\" states.\nBelow is a screenshot after the first step is completed.\n\n\nEDIT: 3+ years later, I can no longer reproduce the fix that I posted here.  There is clearly a bug in the MATE version of the tool.\nARandR is nice for multiple reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't suffer from the rotation bug (it knows the correct geometries for each display).\n\n*It doesn't have the snapping feature, so you can put the displays where you want them.\n\n*It lets you save your layouts as a shell scripts -- giving you a quick way to restore prior states\n\n\nA: There is a very detailed and comprehensive post by Nicolas Bernaerts to rearrange a multiple-monitor setting using xrandr and make the changes persistent here.\nThe post mentions that it is for a dual-monitor setup but it can also be used for a triple-monitor setup.\n\nA: I use ARandR (a front-end to XRandR) for this.  ARandR is independent of your graphical environment; it is not a part of GNOME but should work fine if you are running GNOME or whatever else.  (I prefer a minimalist setup and run Xfce.)\n\nTo enable a display that is not currently on, go to the Outputs menu, hover your mouse over the connection type, and check the Active box.\nOnce you have your desired layout, save it to a file (e.g. ~/.screenlayout/triple-head.sh).  You can set this to load automatically by making the file executable (chmod +x ~/.screenlayout/triple-head.sh) and then adding it to Startup Applications Preferences in your Control Center (the saved layout is the Command, the Name is what you see in the menus, and the Comment is a description of what this does).  In certain(?) circumstances, the configuration is loaded automatically upon launching your X session.\nYou can also switch between saved layouts in the same kind of manner; just execute the saved layout, perhaps with a keyboard shortcut or even a script to recognize the different monitors as they are plugged in.\n", "Q: How to generate sha1 hashes of a whole dvd?

They call this \"fast boot\". For a dual-boot system, you should deactivate this so that filesystems are unmounted when you shutdown Windows. When you do, this filesystem will be marked as \"clean\" and you'll have no problems mounting it in Ubuntu. \nIf you no longer have Windows 8 and need to mount the filesystem, you can drop to a terminal and run sudo ntfsfix --clear-dirty /dev/sdb2.

I followed the install instructions, moving the appropriate libraries to/usr/lib.\nubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Downloads/flycapture.2.7.3.13_armhf$ cat README_ARM \nFlyCapture2 ARM README\n\n1) Overview\n\nFlyCapture2 has been tested on a pandabard which is available from www.pandaboard.org.  FlyCapture2 ARM should also work on other TI OMAP hardware such as the beagleboard.  The library and all its dependencies have been compiled using the CodeSourcery cross compiler.  This readme will not go in too much detail on how to configure an OMAP device and how to load a linux operating system on it.  It will concentrate on installation of the FlyCapture2 library.\n\n2) Prerequisites\n\n* Pandaboard or other OMAP device (recommended is a pandaboard at www.pandaboard.org)\n* Linux distribution on the Pandaboard (recommended is ubunut 11.04 at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/OmapNetbook)\n* A PGR usb Camera\n* A powered USB hub.  The pandaboard does not provide enough power to operate the camera.\n\n3) Installation\n\n    1. Copy your flycapture-<version>_arm.tar.gz package on a network or usb drive and copy it to a location on the pandaboard.\n    2. untar the installation package:\n        > tar xvfz flycapture-<version>_arm.tar.gz\n    3. copy all libraries to system folders:\n        > cd flycapture-<version>_arm/lib\n        > sudo cp libflycapture.so* /usr/lib \n    4. configure permissions to run PGR cameras:\n        > sudo sh flycap2-conf\n    5. follow the instructions that the script takes you through\n    6. Restart your board.\n\n4) Running FC2 Examples\n\nYou should be able to go into the flycapture-<version>_arm/bin folder where you extracted the package and launch any of the examples.  They will run and grab some images but will error out when trying to convert between image formats.  In the full release versions of FlyCapture2 ARM we will provide examples that run fully but due to the fact that there is no IPP availability on ARM the image conversions will not work in the current state of the library.  Also there will be no AVI saving in this version of the library.\n\n5) Compiling software against flycapture. \n\nThere are a number of ways you can build your software to run on an OMAP board with flycapture.\n    1. Build software right on the board using gnu compiler tools by installing in the least the build-essentials package from ubuntu repository.\n    2. Use a cross compiler to build for the target architecture.  One such cross compiler that works well is CodeSourcery.\n    3. Set up an ARM emulator using QEmu and install ubuntu on it.  Then build your software on the virtual machine.\n\nUPDATE:  I think this library might have something to do with \"glade\" which is an XML description of a user interface.  Indeed, on closer look I saw two .glade files, including one referencing GTK:\nubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Downloads/flycapture.2.7.3.13_armhf/bin$ ls\nAsyncTriggerEx                 FlyCapture2Test-9420273-4.pgm\nC                              FlyCapture2Test-9420273-5.pgm\nCustomImageEx                  FlyCapture2Test-9420273-6.pgm\nExtendedShutterEx              FlyCapture2Test-9420273-7.pgm\nFlyCap2                        FlyCapture2Test-9420273-8.pgm\nFlyCap2.glade                  FlyCapture2Test-9420273-9.pgm\nFlyCapture2GUI_GTK.glade       GigEGrabEx\nFlyCapture2Test                GrabCallbackEx\nFlyCapture2Test-9420273-0.pgm  HighDynamicRangeEx\nFlyCapture2Test-9420273-1.pgm  ImageEventEx\nFlyCapture2Test-9420273-2.pgm  MultipleCameraEx\nFlyCapture2Test-9420273-3.pgm\n\nInstalling libglade2-dev and libgladeui-dev did not help unfortunately.\n\nA: README in Linux x64 version of FlyCapture2 says:\n\nDEPENDENCIES:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*libraw1394-8\n  \n*libgtkmm-2.4-dev\n  \n*libglademm-2.4-dev\n  \n*libgtkglextmm-x11-dev (libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev in Ubuntu 8.10 and up)\n  \n*libusb-1.0 (Only in Ubuntu 9.04 and up)\n  \n  \n  Ubuntu 12.04:\nsudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0\n\nUbuntu 10.04:\nsudo apt-get install libraw1394-11 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libusb-1.0-0\n\nUbuntu 9.04:\nsudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-dev libusb-1.0\n\nUbuntu 8.10:\nsudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev\n\nUbuntu 8.04:\nsudo apt-get install libraw1394-8 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev libgtkglextmm-x11-dev\n\n\nlibusb-1.0 for distributions earlier than 9.04 can be obtained from the\nPoint Grey downloads section. libusb-1.0 can be then be manually installed by \ndouble clicking the extracted .deb package and following the instructions.\nAfter installing raw1394 you may need to add the raw1394 module to be loaded on start.\nTo do this just add \"raw1394\" to the /etc/modules file.\n", "Q: configure Intel integrated graphics in thinkpad to drive external 4k display only, via HDMI, using xorg.conf Using the interactive displays configuration tool from the Ubuntu desktop, I have successfully configured this Thinkpad X1 Carbon (2014) with its integrated Intel video to drive an external display at 3840x2160 via the HDMI port, and not to use the display built in to the laptop.  This is the configuration I want for this workstation.\nI don't use the Ubuntu desktop for every day work; rather, I use fvwm (still on Ubuntu, just not the Ubuntu desktop).

If there are any hardware problems at all (which are very unlikely), I'm sure you can google a work-around. You can burn the .iso to a CD (my recommendation) or use a utility like UNetbootin to put it on a flash drive or external hard drive. If you haven't used a GNU/Linux operating system (what you call Linux) before, you might want to get something with a lightweight GUI like Xubuntu or, if you're low on RAM or want something more lightweight, Lubuntu. Lubuntu has more bugs than Xubuntu (from my experience), so even if you don't need the bells and whistles of Xfce (Xubuntu), I recommend it anyway. Just because it's a server machine doesn't mean you need Ubuntu Server. Even if you are using it as a server, get something with a GUI so you can configure it easily. I have been using Ubuntu for years and I still have no idea how to configure networking from a CLI (command line interface).\n", "Q: apt-get remove libstdc++-4.8-doc | 101MB will be freed?

I have a test page, that when I access it, it returns the error code 500 Internal Server Error, and there is an \n  \"End of script output before headers\" \n\nerror in /var/log/apache2/error.log. \nThis is not a script, it is an elf executable. \n\nA: According to Apache documentation:\n\nFirst, all output from your CGI program must be preceded by a\nMIME-type header. This is HTTP header that tells the client what sort\nof content it is receiving. Most of the time, this will look like:\nContent-type: text/html\nSecondly, your output needs to be in HTML, or some other format that a\nbrowser will be able to display. Most of the time, this will be HTML,\nbut occasionally you might write a CGI program that outputs a gif\nimage, or other non-HTML content.\n\nI guess that your program (elf executable) doesn't print out http header before content.\n\nUPDATE\nIn order to execute CGI program in your home directory /var/www you shoud add:\n<Directory /var/www>\n    Options +ExecCGI\n    AddHandler cgi-script .bin\n</Directory>\n\nWhere AddHandler directive allow CGI program execution for all file ending with .bin extension in /var/www directory.\nAnother possibility is to create your cgi-bin directory and put your executable in it.\nIn this case, add in your Apache configuration file:\n<Directory /var/www/mycgi-bin>\n    Options ExecCGI\n    SetHandler cgi-script\n</Directory>\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04, I ran in a problem which I don't think I resolved 100% yet. I just can't explain it. At first I had this ScriptAlias definition:\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/project/cgi-bin/\n\nAfter about 4h of research, I found out that somehow the cgi-bin alias path was in conflict for binary executables (.ELF files). Strangely enough, it worked just fine with a shell script, just not with a binary... So I finally tried with:\nScriptAlias /cgi/ /var/www/project/cgi-bin/\n\nand it worked!!! Any other changes to my settings had no bearing on the results (i.e. everything was properly setup).\nMy definition is under a <VirtualHost ...> definition, so it should have no conflicts. But conflicts there were for sure.\n\nSide Note\nMake sure to restart each time you make changes to your settings to make sure they are effective and you are testing something expected:\n$ sudo systemctl restart apache2\n\nNot only that, if you mistype something, it's going to let you know right away.\n", "Q: No greeter after uninstalling Evolution I'm using Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 LTS.

Or:\npkill postgres\n\nThat kills all processes named 'postgres'.\nDo not use kill -9 (kill -KILL). Just kill (without options) does a SIGTERM, which is what you want.\nAlternatively, you can check the pgdata location if you can connect to PostgreSQL. For example:\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"SHOW data_directory\";\n\n...or by checking its environment variables in /proc/[postmaster pid]/environ, where you identify the postmaster with ps -fHC postgres. Look for the one that's the parent of the other postgres processes. For example:\npostgres   794     1  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:03 /usr/pgsql-9.3/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data -p 5432\npostgres   857   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:00   postgres: logger process   \npostgres   871   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:00   postgres: checkpointer process   \npostgres   872   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:00   postgres: writer process   \npostgres   873   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:00   postgres: wal writer process   \npostgres   874   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:03   postgres: autovacuum launcher process   \npostgres   875   794  0 Nov06 ?        00:00:07   postgres: stats collector process   \n\nIts datadir will generally be shown on its command line.\n\nA: It makes me nervous seeing kill and postgres in the same command. To answer the question using only pg_ctl, that would be:\npg_ctl -D $(psql -Xtc 'show data_directory') stop\n\nThe -X argument says to ignore the .psqlrc file. This is useful if you have psql configured to emit the time taken by a query (via the \\timing command).\nThe -t argument says to remove the column name at the top of the output and the total number of rows produced.\nThe -c argument contains the SQL code to be executed.\nRunning a bare psql -c 'show data_directory' will probably produce the following output:\n      data_directory\n--------------------------\n /path/to/postgresql/data\n(1 row)\n\nHence, backticking this through $( ... ) will deliver /path/to/postgresql/data to the -D argument of pg_ctl, which will then stop the database in an orderly manner. \n\nA: This work for me\nref. https://stackoverflow.com/a/5408501/248616\nSELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'YOUR_NAME';\n\n\nA: You can simply run the command\nsystemctl stop postgresql\n\nWhen you wish to restart it run\nsystemctl start postgresql\n\n\n*\n\n*It is likely these commands will require you to append sudo\n", "Q: Find & Delete duplicated files on multiple harddisks at once I have 4 hard disks and want to find out which files on this four harddisks (including sub directories) are duplicates. It should be checked not only within a harddisk but against all the others as well.\nThe hard disks are large (3TB) therefor it has to be efficient (first filename than checksum checks or so)\n\nA: The script below looks for duplicate files in up to 10 directories at once, looking for duplicates in the combined directories.\nIt should be dramatically faster than both fdupes (running fdupes -r) and fslint; on a relatively small directory of 40GB, locally stored, it took the script 5 seconds to create a dupe list, while it took fdupes and fslint much longer (~ 90 / 100 seconds). On a larger directory (700GB, ~350000 files) on a relatively slow external USB drive, it took 90 minutes. With fdupes it would have been over 200-250 minutes, looking at the progress indication (which is nice, the script below doesn't show the progress), but I didn't wait for it all the way.\nI should mention that for example fslint offers additional functionality, which the script does not (as it is), so the comparison is strictly on creating the dupes list.\nFurthermore, the speed depends for a part on how fast the disk reads: I tested several media (a.o on a network drive) with huge differences, especially on smaller directories, where creating the file list takes a relatively great part of the job ('s time).\nThe bottom line is that it won't be a quick job either which way, you might ask yourself if the directories aren't too large.\nHow it works\nWhen the script finds duplicates, the duplicates are listed as follows:\nCreating file list... /home/jacob/Bureaublad/test2\nCreating file list... /home/jacob/Bureaublad/foto\nCreating file list... /home/jacob/Bureaublad/Askubuntu\nChecking for duplicates (10790 files)...\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n>  found duplicate: test1.txt 2 \n\n/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test2/test1.txt\n/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test2/another directory/test1.txt\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nand so on\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ntotal_filelist = []\ntotal_names = []\n\ndef find_files(directory):\n    l = []; l2 = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            l.append(file)\n            l2.append(root+\"/\"+file)\n    return (l, l2)\n\ni = 1\nwhile i <= 10:\n    try:\n        dr = (sys.argv[i])\n        print(\"Creating file list...\", dr)\n        total_filelist = total_filelist+find_files(dr)[1]\n        total_names = total_names+find_files(dr)[0]\n        i = i+1\n    except IndexError:\n        break\n\nprint(\"Checking for duplicates (\"+str(len(total_names)),\"files)...\")\n\nfor name in set(total_names):\n    n = total_names.count(name)\n    if n > 1:\n        print(\"-\"*60,\"\\n>  found duplicate:\",\n              name, n, \"\\n\")\n        for item in total_filelist:\n            if item.endswith(\"/\"+name):\n                print(item)\n\nprint(\"-\"*60, \"\\n\")\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as find_dupes.py and run it by the command:\npython3 <script> <directory1> <directory2> <directory3> \n\nUp to max 10 directories\nMore options of the script\nIt is relatively simple to add additional functionality; move duplicates to another directory for example, renaming etc, so you can either manually or automatically decide which file to keep.\nHow to make the job doable\nYour directories seem huge. To make the job reasonably possible, there is another, more sophisticated way to prevent the system from \"choking\": instead of doing the job on all file types (extensions) at once, you could cut the job into sections per file type. A small test on a directory of 30.000 files reduced the time from appr. 20 seconds (all files) to 0.3 second for one extension.\nTo make the script look for duplicates of only one file type, replace the section of the script:\ndef find_files(directory):\n    l = []; l2 = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            l.append(file)\n            l2.append(root+\"/\"+file)\n    return (l, l2)\n\nby:\ndef find_files(directory):\n    l = []; l2 = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            if file.endswith(\".py\"): # example .py extension\n                l.append(file)\n                l2.append(root+\"/\"+file)\n    return (l, l2)\n\nFinding occurring file extensions\nTo list all occurring file extension in a directory, you can use the script below:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nl = []\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(sys.argv[1]):\n    for f in files:\n        if (\n        f.startswith(\".\"),\n        f.count(\".\") == 0,\n        f.endswith(\"~\"),\n        ) == (False, False, False):\n            l.append(f[f.rfind(\".\"):])\nfor item in set(l):\n    print(item)\n\nCopy it into an empty file, save it as find_extensions.py and run it by the command:\npython3 <script> <diretory>\n\nExample ouput:\n.txt\n.mp3\n.odt\n.py\n.desktop\n.sh\n.ods\n\n\nA: If you'd like to use a very capable GUI, try FSlint from the Software Center.\n(I see that @lemonsqueeze suggested this in the comments above).\nHere is an answer that outlines FSlint usage:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/472244/100356\n\nA: I used the FSlint project and find to get the thing done.\nMy process to get all of this sorted out on multiple disks with the requirement to run everything via CLI & screen\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install fslint\n\n*find path1/2/3 -type f -empty -delete & find path1/2/3 -type d -empty -delete (to get rid of alle empty or not completly copied stuff)\n\n*/usr/share/fslint/fslint/findsn path1 path2 path3 (delete everything which is stored on the same directory with the same size on different disks)\n\n*/usr/share/fslint/fslint/findup path1 path2 path3 (delete all duplicate files)\n\n*find path1/2/3 -type d -empty -delete (to get rid of the directories which are empty after findup)\n\n\nafter that I was able to mount all disks as a combined drive with mhddfs again without having duplicates wasting diskspace again\n", "Q: Convert all .ape files to .flac in different subfolders I was trying to convert some .ape files to .flac files using avconv on command line; obviously, avconv is not the main point here; its syntax is pretty straightforward, avconv -i inputApeFile.ape outputFlacFile.flac. \nThe point is that the files are nested in more subfolders; i.e., I have the Artist folder, then various CD subfolders, each of one contain different .ape files.\nHow can I convert all the files and then save them in the same folder of the original file but with the .flac extension?\nIf it is possible, I'd like to use only shell command on a single line without using scripts. I think it should be something like that\navconv -i 'ls -R | grep ape' '???'\n\nbut I'm stuck with the second part (maybe using sed??!?)\n\nA: The command that you need is:\nfind /path/to/MainDir/ -type f -name \"*.ape\"  -execdir sh -c ' avconv -i \"$1\" \"${1%.ape}.flac\" ' _ {} \\;\n\nThis will find each file that has .ape suffix and then convert it with the same filename with .flac suffix to the same location as original file is located.\n{} is the path of current found file.\nSee the test from here\n\nA: The (python) script below should do the job.

What should I care just before saving the file.\n\nA: ubuntu.excellmedia.net is a mirror. In this case for India. Mirrors are mainly there to speed up downloading: downloading from a site closer to you is faster than from a site in the UK. It also lowers stress on other servers holding the Ubuntu system.

This is the bash script:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Starting GPS info gathering\"\nwhile true; do\n    awk -F, -f gpsgetinfo.awk gpsoutput.tr\n\n done\n\nFinally, my awk program is very simple which I want it to constantly read the latest record from the gpsoutput.tr file and extract the above mentioned infos, in the three separate files. the awk program (gpsgetinfo.awk) is as follows:\nBEGIN {\n    FS = \",\"; \n    OFS = \" \";\n\n    while ((getline < \"gpsoutput.tr\") > 0) {\n\n\n        if($1==\"$GPRMC\") {\n                converted = $8*1.852; \n                printf $4 \" \" $6 \"\\n\" >> \"data1.txt\";\n                printf \"%.3f \\n\", converted >> \"speed.txt\";\n                printf $2 \"\\n\" >> \"gpstime.txt\";\n        }\n\n\n    }\n}\n\n\nEND {\n    fflush();\n}\n\nThe problem is, that in my output files (data1.txt, speed.txt and gpstime.txt) from the awk program, the same output is repeating several times and within a few seconds, the file size is reaching to the size of Mega bytes. To make it clear. This is how my utc time output file looks: \n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095546.000\n\nand it repeats for several 100 times in the file.\nWhile the expected output in gpstime.tr should just be :\n095546.000\n095547.000\n095548.000\n095549.000\n095550.000\n095551.000\n\nand so on.. since the gps signal is received every 1 second.\nThe gpsoutput.tr file where the nmea data is being saved, is just a few kbs, and without any recurrences in data.\nCan anyone tell me . why the output files are having so many repeated values?  I have also tried using printf $4 \" \" $6 \"\\n\" > \"data1.txt\"; (single > instead of >>) but didn't work for me.\n\nA: The problem is indeed what @Lekensteyn explained. Since your file is constantly growing, your awk will always repeat the lines it has already processed. Unfortunately, using tail -f is not a solution since that will go on for ever and awk will not print anything.\nInstead, use the same script as suggested by @Lekensteyn but with > instead of >>:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\nBEGIN {\n    FS = \",\";\n}\n$1 == \"$GPRMC\" {\n    converted = $8*1.852; \n    print $4, $6 > \"data1.txt\";\n    printf \"%.3f \\n\", converted > \"speed.txt\";\n    print $2 > \"gpstime.txt\";\n}\n\nYou then run that script every second to re-create your output files:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Starting GPS info gathering\"\nwhile true; do\n    ./gpsgetinfo.awk gpsoutput.tr    \n done\n\n\nA: If the GPS data file only grows instead of overwritten, then you will write the same data over and over again, that is why you get duplicates.\nYou must somehow keep feeding new lines to awk. This can be done using tail --follow:\ntail -f gpsoutput.tr | ./gpsoutput.awk\n\nYour gpsoutput.awk should then be this executable script:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\nBEGIN {\n    FS = \",\";\n}\n$1 == \"$GPRMC\" {\n    converted = $8*1.852; \n    print $4, $6 >> \"data1.txt\";\n    printf \"%.3f \\n\", converted >> \"speed.txt\";\n    print $2 >> \"gpstime.txt\";\n    # Optional: add fflush() here.\n}\n\n", "Q: System program problem detected showing at boot I have been facing this dialog for a long time lately.

You could zip that folder and upload it somewhere and I will have a look at it if you want, but keep in mind, the information contained in there could possibly risk your privacy, but most likely it wont.\nIf you want to disable apport (I do not recommend that) you can change enabled=1 to enabled=0 in /etc/default/apport.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to AutoKey?

I am on UBUNTU 13.10, and use an NTFS partition as storage. \nTypically, I mount it by clicking on the name of the partition in Nautilus.\nI wished to mount it automatically at startup, so I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*From disks, edit mount options.., mount at startup (tested with \"show user interface\" off and on)\n\n*from startup applications, creating an item \n/usr/bin/udisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/500D4BE5454B55ED\nIn all cases, the partition shows as already mounted and can be normally accessed in nautilus.\nBut at least some applications don't seem to see all the files inside.\nFor instance, Virtualbox will not find my virtual machines, lightzone shows the label of the partition in media, but it will only show no files upon selecting it.\nSynapse as well seems to be unable to search, but I might have done some mistake in configdb, so I will open a separate question about it if I still have problems once I solve this.\nThanks!\n\nA: The general way to have a disk mount at startup would be to make an appropriate entry in /etc/fstab\nThe information that you will need for the entry can be located using findmnt while the disk is mounted, but I suspect you already have all of the required information.\n\nA: Note: As suggested, you should definitely consider upgrading to 12.04 or 14.04. and avoid running an EOLed OS\nTo mount a partition at startup, we need an entry in the fstab file.\nopen terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and type the following command\nsudo blkid\nThis would list down all partitions available on your system. Note down the UUID of the NTFS partition that you want to mount at boot.\nnow create a folder, for example sudo mkdir /media/storage. This is the folder where your ntfs partition will be mounted at. This folder will be owned by root. To give other users permission to r/w into this folder we need to give permissions. so chmod -R 777 /media/storage would be good enough. Now you need to edit your fstab file. to do so, type the following command.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\ngo to the bottom of the file and add the following line there.\nUUID=0C0B1E /media/storage/    ntfs-3g        auto,user,rw 0 0\nof cource replace my UUID with the UUID that you noted down earlier. Reboot system and you should be good to go.\n\nA: Thanks so much both!\nI followed the instructions but the system was unable to find the partition upon startup.\nSo, I realized that the file already existed in media , but under media/myUserName/Data2\nI changed the line in fstab to  media/myUserName/Data2 , while leaving the same ID and it worked.\nI am still confused why it is Data2 rather than Data, given both Data2 and Data exist in media/myUserName and sudo blkid and nautilus give Data as label, not Data2:\nthat's the output from blkid:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"PQSERVICE\" UUID=\"5EB6C932B6C90B89\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"SYSTEM RESERVED\" UUID=\"C8529C51529C465A\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"C26619EE6619E3C7\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"CA88E7BC88E7A4E3\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"a55fe4bf-d74c-4bed-859d-4caef19e61a9\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: UUID=\"c68503c2-60aa-4a36-9fa2-6d6c9af18d86\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nIn any case, now everything seems to work as it should. \nNot sure why the other methods I tried failed but I look again into it and will post a question if I don't understand where I went wrong.\nThanks again!\n", "Q: The resolution is squashed!

It's OK to copy the commands you see below, then switch to the shell prompt and paste them in with Ctrl-Shift-V\n1) Find the UUIDs of the Partitions: The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) reference for all partitions can be found by opening a command line (or shell prompt), then type the following to make a file with a list of all your UUIDs: \nblkid > uuid-list.txt && cat uuid-list.txt\n2) Back up and edit fstab: This is a file Kubuntu uses to decide what partitions to mount at boot time. The following commands, also executed from a shell prompt, will duplicate your current fstab, append the year-month-day to the end of the file name, compare the two files and open the original for editing.\n2A) Duplicate your fstab file:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n2B) Compare the two files to confirm the backup matches the original:\ncmp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n3) Open the original fstab in a text editor from the shell prompt:\ngksu kate /etc/fstab\nand add these lines into it\n# (identifier)  (location, eg sda5)   (format, eg ext3 or ext4)      (some settings)\nUUID=????????   /media/home    ext4          defaults       0       2\nand replace the \"????????\" with the UUID number of your intended /home partition.\n4) Save and Close the fstab file, then type the following command from the shell prompt:\nsudo mkdir /media/home\nThis command creates a new directory, later used for temporarily mounting the new partition. At the end of the procedure this directory can be removed.\n5) Now reload the updated fstab file with this shell prompt command:\nsudo mount -a\nto mount the desired home new partition as /media/home. We will edit the fstab again later so this arrangement of the partition is only temporary.\n6) Copy /home to the New Partition: Next we will copy all files, directories and sub-directories from your current /home directory into the new partition:\nsudo rsync -aXS --exclude='/*/.gvfs' /home/. /media/home/.\nThe --exclude='/*/.gvfs' prevents rsync from complaining about not being able to copy .gvfs  and, even if rsync complains, it will copy everything else anyway. (For more detail, see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=791693)\n7) Check Copying Worked: You should now have two duplicate copies of all the data within your home directory; the original being located in /home and the new duplicate located in /media/home. You should confirm all files and directories copied over successfully. One way to do this is by using the diff command:\nsudo diff -r /home /media/home\n8) Prepare fstab for the switch: We now need to modify the fstab again to point to the new partition and mount it as /home. So again on a command-line\ngksu kate /etc/fstab\nand now edit the lines you added earlier, changing the \"/media/home\" part to simply say \"/home\" so that it looks like this:\n# (identifier)  (location, eg sda5)   (format, eg ext3 or ext4)      (some settings) \nUUID=????????   /home    ext4          defaults       0       2\nThen, press Save, close the file but don't reboot just yet.\n9) Moving /home into /old_home: Backing up your old home, just in case things have not gone completely smoothly, is best done right now. Here is how: \nAs long as you have not rebooted yet, you will still see 2 copies of your /home directory; the new one on the new partition (currently mounted as /media/home) and the old one still in the same partition it was always in (currently mounted as /home). We need to move the contents of the old home directory out of the way and create an empty \"placeholder\" directory to act as a mount point for our new partition.\nType the following string of commands in to do all this at once:\ncd / && sudo mv /home /old_home && sudo mkdir /home\nBy default, when you open a terminal window it places you within your home directory. Typing cd / takes us to the root directory and out of home so we can then use the sudo mv command to essentially rename /home into /old_home, and finally create a new, empty /home placeholder.\nWith your fstab now edited to mount your new partition to our /home placeholder and the original /home now called /old_home, re-load the updated fstab \nsudo mount -a\n10) Deleting the old Home: You can delete your old home directory with:\ncd /\nsudo rm -r /old_home\nBe careful with the above command as mistyping it could result in the deletion of other files and directories.\n\nA: you need to change your fstab file to point to the home partition. to do so , do the following.\nopen terminal and type sudo blkid\nnote the UUID of the partition that you want to use as /home directory.\nnow edit the fstab file by typing sudo nano /etc/fstab and add a new entry there like the below\nUUID=_____     /home     ext4     nodev,nosuid     0     2\nFill in the blanks with the UUID of your partition that you noted down earlier.\nNow type the following\ncd / && sudo mv /home /home_old && sudo mkdir /home \nThis will move the present /home directory to /home_old and create a blank /home directory. reboot your system and you should be able to use your ext4 partition as your new /home.\nIf you don't want to reboot, a simple sudo mount -a would do the trick.\nword of caution: all user level setting are stored in /home directory. so doing the above will reset every setting that you might have done.\n", "Q: Epson perfection scanner 2580 Photo does not work with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS My Epson scanner did not work with Ubuntu 12.04 so I upgraded to 14.04 but it's still not working\nI read something about installing drivers\nDoes any one know how exactly?\n\nScanimag -L:device'snapscan:lib usb;001:003 is a Epson Scanner flatbed scanner.\ncould not find stringdescriptor:pipe error.\nwhatever that means!I have got from Ubuntuusers.de the following code:2\nwget http://a1227.g.akamai.net/f/1227/40484/7d/download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/f/01/00/01/58/31/9d81f4deee448e0440c8bcd7af581c3e8a8b43b9/iscan-2.10.0-1.c2.i386.rpm\nwget http://a1227.g.akamai.net/f/1227/40484/7d/download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/f/01/00/01/58/54/1899fd522665e4b1c80fe95252838994192d5207/iscan-plugin-gt-f500-1.0.0-1.c2.i386.rpm\nwhen enter it i get at the place of the 3 a 9 in the SCANIMAG -L result,which is:device 'snapscan:lib usb:001:003 and from:SANE-FIND-SCANNER i get:could not fetch string descriptor,pipe error.I am an absolute beginner,but,or,because of that i think,that,when i could change the 9 to a 3 it should work?!

This is an easy way to install Ubuntu Linux without doing major changes to the drive, but it comes with a lot of draw backs. For example the stability of your Linux file system is always at the mercy of your Windows file system and they are not so good at being stable.

After read and done a lot of things I found this page http://pavelmanushin.blogspot.ru/2014/04/ubuntu-12.html which i think has the solution for my problem. The problem is that I don't understand point 7 when it said \"And now you need to insert this newly created file into your Ubuntu\". What does it means with \"my ubuntu\"? which folder is it? I inserte the wl.ko file in my personal folder, but then I ran \"sudo insmod wl.ko\" (point 9) and the terminal shows \"insmod: ERROR: could not load module wl.ko: No such file or directory\". I think that the problem is that I am not putting the wl.ko file in the correct folder. Nevertheless of this procedure, if someone knows another procedure and want to help, please be my guest. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Maybe you are having a wifi device problem, I had the same kind of problem and it sucked.. I tried everything and yes I also thought that wl.ko is the answer xD but when I tried a USB WiFi device (TP-Link) it automatically connected :) you should try the same maybe it will work out (just an advice) anyways the 7th point means that it will produce a wl.ko file in the top level directory.If your driver does not build, check to make sure you have installed the kernel package described in the requirements above.This driver uses cfg80211 API. Code for Wext API is present and can be built but we have dropped support for it. As before, the Makefile will still build the matching version for your system.\n\nA: it doesnot really matter where the file is.\nOnce you change the terminal current folder to the one where the file wl.ko is located then you may give Ubuntu the next commands as stated in the guide. \n\nA: The blog you have referenced is more or less just a direct copy and paste of the README file posted on the Broadcom driver page.\nThat being said, this shouldn't be particularly difficult as long as you just follow the steps correctly, one at a time.  I'll try to distill the steps in the blog down some to see if that helps reduce the confusion.\nDownload and Compile the Broadcom Driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the correct driver (32 or 64 bit) from the Broadcom download page:\nhttp://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php\n\n*Extract the file you downloaded to a folder in your home directory (for example ~/hybrid_wl)\n\n*Navigate to the folder in a terminal (cd ~/hybrid_wl)\n\n*Run sudo make clean\n\n*Run sudo make\n\n*Run sudo make install (I've found that this last step will copy the module to the appropriate directory for you)\n\n\nUnload any previously installed modules for Wireless\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo lsmod | grep \"brcmsmac\\|b43\\|ssb\\|bcma\\|wl\"\n\n*Remove any of the following modules that exist from the lsmod call\n\n*\n\n*sudo rmmod b43\n\n*sudo rmmod brcmsmac\n\n*sudo rmmod ssb\n\n*sudo rmmod bcma\n\n*sudo rmmod wl\n\n\n*Blacklist the unnecessary drivers to prevent conflicts in the future\n\n*\n\n*sudo echo \"blacklist ssb\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\"\n\n*sudo echo \"blacklist bcma\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\"\n\n*sudo echo \"blacklist b43\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\"\n\n*sudo echo \"blacklist brcmsmac\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\"\nInstall the wl.ko driver\n\n\n*\n\n*You should still be in the same folder that you compiled the source from (e.g. ~/hybrid_wl.  If not, please cd ~/hybrid_wl\n\n*Load one of the following security modules (typically the first one should work)\n\n*\n\n*sudo modprobe lib80211\n\n*sudo modprobe ieee80211_crypt_tkip\n\n\n*sudo modprobe cfg80211\n\n*sudo insmod wl.ko\n\n*sudo depmod -a\nAt this point your WiFi should be enabled and able to detect wireless networks.  The final step is to update your initrd file with your new module configuration.  In Ubuntu, it seems that simply blacklisting ssb is not enough.  We must rebuild the initrd file in order for your new module configuration to take effect on boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your existing initrd: cp /boot/initrd.img-\\uname -r` ~`\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n*sudo init 6 (reboot)\n\n\nAt this point your wireless module should successfully load on boot, and you should not have to install again unless a kernel upgrade forces you to recompile the driver.\n", "Q: cant compile audio software I tried to install an audio software (SO-KL5 synth).

I have a nvidia geforce 840m with intel hd graphics and an intel i7 4th generation, its an asus laptop k550l. I am wondering if i can use the nvidia optimus technology with bumblebee even if it is not specified with a stick or anything on my laptop, I know it increases battery life and that is my main problem so far. thanks!\n\nA: Go to \nSystem Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers\n\nChoose your preferred drivers.\nWith Bumblebee if you want to run an application using dedicated graphics use:\n    optirun <AppName>\n\n\nA: Up until 2013, nVidia didn't have any plans to support optimus technology in Linux. That's the reason project Bumblebee had started. But in May 2013, nVidia started providing partial support for optimus tech on Linux and it has been quite some time. \nBut Bumblebee has evolved a lot and is officially supported by Ubuntu since Ubuntu 13.10. You can head over to the wiki page and install the bumblebee drivers and try them out. It is quite battery efficient and is also suggested by steam for running steam games on linux. And if it doesn't suit your needs, you can definitely fall back to the proprietary nVidia drivers and install them from System Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers\n", "Q: 'Grotty' man page messages If I try to search within certain man pages using grep, I get several 'grotty' messages.\nFor example:\nman mpv | grep dvdnav\n\nresults in:\nmpv dvdnav://[longest|menu|title][/device] [options]\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):90690: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):90694: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):90698: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):90702: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):91895: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):91899: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):91903: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):91907: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):94450: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):94454: character above first line discarded\ngrotty:<standard input> (<standard input>):94458: character above first line discarded\n                                                  │dvdnav://              │ dvdnav://menu                         │\n\nWhat causes these messages and how do I prevent them?\n\nA: I have no mpv installed, but this seems more a warning of grotty (the program that process man page sources to print it to standard output) probably coming from no-compliant man pages. Have you tried \nman mpv 2> /dev/null | grep dvdnav\n\n? This will redirect error and warnings from grotty to the sink, so that you should have a cleaner output. \nNevertheless, that error is probably a bug in the mpv man page (or in grotty, you never know).\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this is being caused by a bug in the man page text formatter. \n[Update: Also see this answer w/ ref to bug report.]\nman grotty says,\n\ngrotty translates the output of GNU troff into a form suitable for\n  typewriter-like devices.\n\n\nTo debug this first, check if you can also display this man page with groffer (graphical roffer).  \nWhen I ran into these errors, I found that groffer worked fine, without the error, but grotty threw up this 'character above first line discarded' error.  \n\nSo I dug a little deeper.  The page that was giving me the trouble was zoneminder.1.\nFirst I unzipped it:\ngunzip -k zoneminder.1.gz\n\nThen using this I can run a test:\nman -l man.1 | grep jksffjsd   #-l means man the local file, i.e. produce error messages\n\nNow edit zoneminder.1 with divide and conquer.  First deleted the last 1/2 of it and the error went away.  Then deleted only the last 3/4 of it and the error was still there.  Then deleted the last 5/8 of it and the error was still there.  Then took a look at it and started to just remove a few lines at a time until the error toggled from on to off. \nI found myself in a table, and could only delete some whole entries from the table (see image below).\nWhat I found was that this table was what was messing up, but only when it overflowed to the next page, as is shown here:\n\nRemove one more entry from the table and the errors go away.\n\nSo it's fair to just ignore this.\nI'll see if I can report it as a bug in grotty.\n\nA: This is over 5 years old; I know. But if someone else is facing the same issue,  I've just answered a question like this; quite simply:\nHow to use grep to search for options in a man page?\n$ man ls | grep -- '--a'\n     -a, --all\n     -A, --almost-all\n     --author\n\n\nAnd to narrow down the results to just lines starting with a hyphen:\ngrep '^[[:space:]]*-' – \n\n\nTest run:\n$ man shutdown | grep -- '-' | grep '^[[:space:]]*-'\n       --help\n       -H, --halt\n       -P, --poweroff\n       -r, --reboot\n       -h\n       -k\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.1 LTS Minimum Requirements Is it possible to install Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.1 LTS (32 bit) on My System \n\n\n*\n\n*1 GB of RAM\n\n*AMD Athlon 64 processor (32bit)\n\n*100 GB of hard-drive space \n\n\nWhat are the Minimum Requirements For Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.1 LTS\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu GNOME Wiki, the minimum requirements are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*1 GHz processor (for example Intel Celeron or better)\n  \n*1.5 GB RAM (system memory)\n  \n*7 GB of free hard drive space for installation\n  \n\nSo, it doesn't sound like your computer will have enough RAM to run Ubuntu GNOME.  The processor and hard-drive space seem to be sufficient, so I suppose you could just get more RAM and see if it works, but you may have better luck anyways running Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I undo changes made in HDA Analyzer?

ODBC backend seems supported just for 32-bit wine prefix. So if running 64-bit Ubuntu, default prefix will be 64-bit, and these are necessary steps to install ODBC support:\n\n\n*\n\n*create 32bit wine prefix (if it doesn't exist):\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/zetah/prefix32\" WINEARCH='win32' wine 'wineboot'\n\n\n*install necessary libraries:\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/zetah/prefix32\" winetricks jet40 mdac28\n\n\n*install the program that needs ODBC in this prefix\n\n*after downloading 32-bit ODBC driver from http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/ install it:\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/zetah/prefix32\" wine msiexec /i psqlodbc.msi\n\nAfter this accessing local PostgreSQL server should be possible inside wine program through ODBC.\n\nA: The answer of zetah is alwys good, but there is a potential problem with some versions of winetrick that have for effect that the dialog box of odbcad32.exe is not displayed. The workaround is  by setting 'odbccp32' to 'native,builtin' via 'winecfg'.\n", "Q: Dual-boot loads Windows 8.1 first, and Ubuntu occasionally completely crashes The title says it all really, but to give you some context, I only recently installed Ubuntu 14.10 on a Lenovo Flex 15D laptop, which came with Windows pre-installed. I've still been using Windows most of the time because in order for me to boot Ubuntu, I usually have to hold shift as I press restart, and tell Windows to load Ubuntu via a menu, on the next power-up. Then, even as I'm using Ubuntu, it will occasionally crash straight to a black screen as if I had just taken the battery out of the laptop.\nI'm sure this has been a fairly common problem; what information can I give so someone might help me troubleshoot this a bit?\nThanks for your time!\n\nA: You can select which OS will boot first by changing the boot order -- use efibootmgr from Ubuntu or bcdedit (I think) on the Windows side. Windows does like to keep putting itself first, so expect to have to do this every now and then. Selection at Power on should be available through the use of a function key (varies by machine, but sometimes the vendor splash screen indicates which key it is).  Take a look at the log files to hopefully get a clue why the crash occurred.\n", "Q: Synapse unable to search mounted partition I have an NTFS partition I use for storage, and I don't manage to have synapse searching into it.\nFor the moment, I have followed this advice, basically removing /media from PRUNEPATHS and running sudo updatedb\nMy updatedb.conf currently looks like this:\n PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS=\"yes\"\n# PRUNENAMES=\".git .bzr .hg .svn\"\n# original\n# PRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media /home/.ecryptfs\"\n# PRUNEFS=\"NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ecryptfs fusesmb devtmpfs\"\n\n# modified\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /home/.ecryptfs\"\n\nPRUNEFS=\"rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ecryptfs fusesmb devtmpfs\"\n\nInitially, I have not touched PRUNEFS.\nBecause it didn't work, I tried and remove NFS nfs nfs4, sudo updatedb took much longer, which was promising, but still synapse will not index the content of that partition, just the content of my main one.\nCan somebody give me some ideas on how to fix it?\nThanks!\nEDIT:\nFollowing some testing, the full content of the partition appears when searching from Ubuntu's dashboard.\nOnly Synapse seems not to find it, but for one folder and its content. I compared permissions on the that folder and the others and they are all 777, so should be full accessible. I am quite confused honestly..\n\nA: The solution mentioned in the question is not intended to make Synapse find directly any file on any partition by just typing its name, but to achieve this indirectly through locate; that is, to enable locate to have access to files on partitions that were not previously accessible — because excepted (via settings in the file /etc/updatedb.conf) from being added to the databases locate uses .\nSynapse operates file search in two ways: within entries of the Zeitgeist logs, and within those of locate. This type of search is implemented through specific plugins that are by default enabled in Synapse's Properties - Plugins. (If the Zeitgeist plugin is disabled, restarting the computer might be needed after (re)enabling the plugin in order for it to operate properly.) Folder search is based on a separate plugin.\nZeitgeist results appear automatically:\n \n(the same is the case for Folder Search)\nBut that is not the case for results of locate command. Results of locate appear only after selecting the last entry (the one with a question mark) in the list of normal search  and pressing ENTER to run that command:\n\nFor Synapse to show directly a file, it should be recorded in the Zeitgeist logs. But that will not happen until an event related to that file has taken place (like a movie being played, a document being opened), no matter the partition on which the file is located. Some differences between locations need to be mentioned though: see NOTE below.\nZeitgeist is not a file logger, but an activity (event) logger.  (See here.)\nThe solution included in the question itself should make available for the locate process the databases that include files from\na certain partition (which by default is excluded by the file /etc/updatedb.conf), but those files will only be searched by locate (see second image above): only the ones already accessed will subsequently appear directly in Synapse (through Zeitgeist).  \n\nSumming it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*For a file to be directly shown in Synapse it should have been already accessed (e.g. opened). \n*** NOTE: files created on certain privileged locations, like the Desktop, will appear directly. The same for $HOME folders.\n\n*For a file to be accessed through the locate command in Synapse it should not be on a partition excluded in /etc/updatedb.conf, and, after being created, the command sudo updatedb is needed.\n\n*File accessed through the file manager are added to the Zeitgeist log more quickly (or maybe are accessed more quickly within these logs) than when access through Synapse search (with locate). Once a file has been accessed from the file manager, and thus accessible later through  a simple Synapse search, other files from the same location are accessible in Synapse through a simple search.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a new file in ~/Documents, Synapse cannot find it; running locate in Synapse finds nothing. After running sudo updatedb Synapse doesn't show it directly, but running \"locate\" in Synapse finds the file. Opening the file, then searching again in Synapse: the file is shown directly.\n\n*Creating a new file in ~/Desktop, Synapse finds it directly. \n\n*Creating a file new file on a second NTFS partition with the mount point /media/username/DEPO, none of the above works. After I open it, Synapse will show it directly. But if I want to find it without opening it (if it were a new file that I never opened) and try to use locate, it is not found, not even after running sudo updatedb. Editing the file /etc/updatedb.conf as said in the question, restarting the computer and then running sudo updatedb will make the file accessible in Synapse through locate.\nFor the above to work for me, in the file  /etc/updatedb.conf after PRUNEPATHS= the path /media was removed, and now looks like so: \nPRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS=\"yes\"\n# PRUNENAMES=\".git .bzr .hg .svn\"\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /var/lib/os-prober /var/lib/ceph /home/.ecryptfs /var/lib/schroot\"\nPRUNEFS=\"NFS nfs nfs4 rpc_pipefs afs binfmt_misc proc smbfs autofs iso9660 ncpfs coda devpts ftpfs devfs devtmpfs fuse.mfs shfs sysfs cifs lustre tmpfs usbfs udf fuse.glusterfs fuse.sshfs curlftpfs ceph fuse.ceph fuse.rozofs ecryptfs fusesmb\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Searching for a podcast on the secondary partition by typing first letters of its name, Synapse finds nothing, but it finds it with locate; if then I press ENTER to open it, or press TAB and select an application to open, and then search again in Synapse, nothing is found. If, after finding the file with locate, I press TAB, select to open the folder in the file manager, and open the file there, not only that file can be afterwards found in Synapse by just typing its name, but other files located within the same folder can be found in the same way also. (I think this is due to other plugins that involve Zeitgeist: Hybrid Search – complete Zeitgeist results by searching for similar files – and Related files– finds files related to other search results using Zeitgeist.)\n\n\n\nBy the way, in my case removing NFS nfs nfs4 after PRUNEFS= made Synapse take all CPU upon reboot and stuck my computer. I have changed that file back from a live session and proceeded as mentioned.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu fully utilize 64 processors and 64Gb RAM in an HPC (cluster): SGI Altix 3000?

Can ubuntu utilize all of those processors using programs such as blender, openshot (or other HD video apps) -, etc... or would I have to use a custom cluster/hpc distro? It was originally put together to run Red Hat.\n\nA: The SGI Altix 3000 runs on IA64 processors. To cite an answer on ServerFault:\n\nDebian is still kicking out ia64 releases.

With some apt repository tweaking, you'll be able to get similar package versions as well.\n\nI don't see why it wouldn't be able to make use of all the processors and RAM. The Linux kernel easily runs on 256 CPU cores¹ and 1 TiB of memory² without changes to the source code. The default configuration may need a few configuration tweaks though, since it's geared towards AMD64-based workstations.\n¹ The configuration allows up to 4096 CPU cores.\n² Assuming 64 bits of address length. On IA64 it supports up to 2 TiB.\n", "Q: Mounting USB Device in same location I am using an USB Device as a replacement for a floppy disk. I am only using one USB device at a time. How can I make Ubuntu to mount ANY USB device into a fixed folder, eg. /media/USERNAME/USB?\nThanks!\n\nA: As far as I know this will be impossible\nUSB devices are mounted with their name so you need to alter the name of the device. \nTest with 2 different pendrives:\nOpen disks from dash.\n\n\n*\n\n*4,1 Gb Cruzer, Renaming to \"usbdisk\".\n\n*Click the cogwheel in the middle (below the orange volume).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*16.1 Gb, BSix, Renaming to \"usbdisk\".\n\n\n\n\nThe Cruzer is now mounted as \"usbdisk\".\n\nIf you mount the 2nd one it will error out (image created before a reboot but it also shows up after a reboot):\n\nAs you can see in the error notice it knows \"usbdisk\" should be a Cruzer so I doubt this is possible. The system matches the device name what is uses to mount it with the internal name (ie. the \"identify as\") it uses to identify the pendrive. So 2 mountpoints with the same name will be impossible.\n", "Q: No sound in Chrome browser (flash, HTML5) in Kubuntu 12.04 I am running Kubuntu 12.04 LTS and latest Chrome browser.\nSince some update, I cannot get any sound when running any flash video or game\nwithin Chrome or even HTML5 videos like YouTube.\nI have tried to fix it according to various discussions (new profile in Chrome, reinstall Flash, etc...), but nothing worked.\nCan anybody help me please?\nmartin@martin-LIFEBOOK-E8420:~$ lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\nRelease:        12.04\nCodename:       precise\nLinux martin-LIFEBOOK-E8420 3.2.0-70-generic-pae #105-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 24 20:08:22 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\nii  adobe-flash-properties-gtk            11.2.202.411-0precise1                             GTK+ control panel for Adobe Flash Player plugin version 11\nii  adobe-flashplugin                     11.2.202.411-0precise1                             Adobe Flash Player plugin version 11\nrc  flashplugin-installer                 11.2.202.406ubuntu0.12.04.1                        Adobe Flash Player plugin installer\nmartin@martin-LIFEBOOK-E8420:~$ \n\n\nA: Based on help from Volodya and user7134, this helped me:\n\n\n*\n\n*run Chrome\n\n*try to play sound, e.g. run any youtube clip\n\n*run pavucontrol app from command line while youtube playing\n\n*check Chromium part on playback tab and uncheck muted sound\n\n\nOne can solve microphone issues (e.g. Hangouts) in similar way.\n", "Q: A accesses B's shared resources, B cannot access A? Two Ubuntu 14.04 machines, A & B with wired links via local router, are configured identically as far as I can manage. Their smb.conf files, identical except for share path names, declare:\n    workgroup = WORKGROUP\n    wins support = yes\n    name resolve order = wins bcast host\n\nAll media are declared in smb.conf as:\n    read only = No\n    guest ok = Yes\n\nand all media are configured as shareable and \"Allow others to create and delete...\".\nUsing Files, A can see WORKGROUP and access B's shared resources but B cannot see A's WORKGROUP shares nor any other machine shares on WORKGROUP. Windows machines on the same network can see shared resources on both machines (but not access them-- passwords not accepted??). All firewalls, A, B and local router, are off.\nA possible clue: on B, ping A does not find the correct local IP address for A and pings an old address for A from a previous network configuration; on A, ping B works correctly.  arp tables on A and B are essentially similar; B has a correct local address for A.  Where is B getting it's ping IP address for the local machine named A?\nIs there some checklist of network configuration I can use to figure out what is going on here? Sharing on both machines worked well on 12.04 and were recently switched to 14.04 (B was upgraded but A was a fresh install) at the same time as new router installation.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: The problem was that A had no Samba users configured whereas B did. Thus the user of A was known to B and automatically accepted but the B user was unknown to A. In fact, A had no known users (maybe, because it was a new install of 14.04, whereas B was an upgrade) so A neither showed it's shared resources nor allowed access. Users are not configured in smb.conf so I missed this asymmetry between the two machines.\nThis was most easily fixed using the Samba Server Configuration GUI; the Preferences menu includes a Samba Users item and window to add new users with a network password. This adds the user name in /etc/samba/smbusers, a file which didn't exist on B before.\nI believe the user name and possibly the password as well should be the same on each reciprocally shared machine-- at least, it works that way for me. I'm sure there is a way to have a single network user file rather than one on each machine-- I'll figure that out some day.\n", "Q: cannot boot window 7 after installing ubuntu 14.04 64 bit At first, i had  two operating system \n1>window 8 pro  \n2>window 7 ultimate(installed by OEM)\n\nI downloaded ubuntu 14.04 and made my usb drive bootable for ubuntu.

Just make sure which ever Linux OS you chose to get the 32 bit version.\n\nA: I have a 10 year old laptop among one of my computers that runs ubuntu, and besides the obvious ram capabilities, it runs fine for what that computer is used for. As for your laptop specs, I would say it should work just fine. With ubuntu there are updates with the number and sometimes LTS is after it, meaning it is a long term update with more consistences between the previous/next LTS update. I would recommend either 14.04 LTS ubuntu or 14.10 ubuntu. The difference between the two isn't really noticeable from the way it looks, it is mostly all security updates and a few tweaks in the coding. A good thing about downloading it to a disk is that when you go to install you will have the chance to preview it, without changing your operating system over fully just yet. However i will say that during the preview, it has been slow in my experience compared to a full install, simply because it is reading it off the disk, and not the hard drive.

I have fresh installs of Ubuntu and am trying to get it to default to showing the path bar in file open dialogs.

I would like it to either default to \"Documents\" (which shows the path bar), or just always display the path bar in the file dialog. \nBonus, is there a way to have the path bar accept URLs? Say I am prompted to have a image uploaded to a site and I have a URL of the image, in windows I can just paste the URL in the path bar, Ubuntu doesn't seem to be able to do this. Is it possible?\n\nA: Just as a reminder: like any Unix system, Ubuntu has a lot of \"strata\": the kernel proper, the operating system (the collection of programs that \"dress\" the kernel and allow it to work), and on top of that the graphic/desktop system. Ubuntu has a choice of DE (desktop environments) --- Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce, and more. The interface you mention is related with the DE you are using. \nYou are not stating which desktop you are using; if it's Unity or Gnome the default file chooser would be the one provided by gtk. The plain \"Ubuntu\" comes up with Unity as the default DE. \nThe option available for this chooser can be found with the command dconf-editor; run it(1) and navigate to  org > gtk > settings > file-chooser. \n\nIn 1, you choose if the starting directory is the \"Recent\" files or the current directory (which one is this will depend by the application). In 2, you can choose to have just the path bar (default) or having a field to manually enter a filename. \nI do not think there is more configurability... the gnome to gnome2 to gnome3 evolution has seen a lot of \"simplification\" that reduced this kind of tweaks. If you want a much more configurable desktop, probably you should look at KDE. \nAs far as I know, the option to use a remote link as a local file is not implemented in the gtk file-chooser.\n\nFootnotes:\n(1) install with sudo apt-get install dconf-editor if you do not have it. \n\nA: If I may make a suggestion, it sounds like you would be interested in Konqueror.  It is a very powerful and configurable file manager  and web browser.  Because it is vastly more configurable than Nautilis, you should be able to set the UI however you want.  You could set your default home page to your documents folder.  If you open a file path in Konqueror, it will display a file browser.  If you open a web URL, it will display a web browser view.  Konqueror is a part of the KDE (K Desktop Environment) so it does pull in a lot of KDE libraries when you install it, but it will work in Ubuntu just fine.

It still didn't work, so I get the clean /var/cache folder on my ubuntu live-cd and copied it, now whenever I use apt-get it only crashes the terminal windows.\nI would be extremely thankfull if someone could help me!\nThanks\n\nA: Test this:\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\nmkdir /var/cache/apt\nmkdir /var/cache/apt/archives\nmkdir /var/cache/apt/archives/partial\ntouch /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin\ntouch /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin\nmkdir /var/cache/software-center\nmkdir /var/cache/software-center/xapian\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: How can I use workspaces and have xbmc in only one of them? I have Workspaces enabled in Unity.\nThey work with fullscreen video reproduction in VLC and the default video player.\nI can have a video in one workspace, a browser in another, and switch flawlessly between them.\nI can do the same with the Steam video games I have tested, I can have Portal running in a workspace and Chrome in another, and switch between them.\nBut XBMC is something else. It somehow disables workspaces, and in order to switch, I have to close the program. XBMC responds to Alt-Tab in Windows but not in Unity.\nHow can I change workspaces if XBMC is running?\n\nA: If you are running XBMC in fullscreen mode, it is rather possessive. It takes control over the screen, the pointer and some other resources. This is rather useful when it is running stand-alone as a media center but annoying then ran as an desktop app.\nBut there is the option to put it into windowed mode. You can change the modes by pressing \\ (Backspace) or, if you have an other keyboard layout, the key combination that produceds a \\. There are also option to set that in the Settings Menu (Video Output) and the settings files.\nIn windowed mode it might not use the full screen but also it should not interfere with the desktop.\n", "Q: Making Ubuntu Download Bootable from USB How can I make the Ubuntu download bootable from a USB stick without downloading third party software?\nThanks!\n\nA: Assuming you're on Linux,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type sudo su\n\n*lsblk to note which device is your USB.\n\n*mkdir /mnt/myusb && mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myusb (replace b1 with your actual usb device id, /dev/sdb1 in my case)\n\n*grub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=/mnt/myusb/boot /dev/sdb (replacing b if necessary)\n\n*cd /mnt/myusb/boot/grub\n\n*wget pendrivelinux.com/downloads/multibootlinux/grub.cfg\n\n*Copy the iso to the root of your pen drive and modify the grub.cfg file in order to load the isos from the correct location.\nset timeout=10\nset default=0\nmenuentry \"Run Ubuntu Live ISO\" {\nloopback loop /ubuntu-xx-xx-i386.iso linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu-xx-xx-i386.iso splash --\ninitrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\n(replace \"/ubuntu-xx-xx-i386.iso\" with the correct file name)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open any disk utility software and make sure that the partition has got the \"boot\" flag.

However, if I switch back to tty1, I can hear the sound playing!\nWhy this is happening, and how to tell to startx that I want the sound on the TTY which the gui is presented?\n\nA: A way to solve this problem is to disable pulseaudio   .  \n(note that pulseaudio is usually not  needed to get sound, as almost all Linux software can use alsa if pulseaudio is not active. Exception is Skype which needs pulseaudio  .\nThe main problem is that you must install and use gnome-alsamixer to set volume instead standard volume applet.\nAnother problem is that you will lose auto-switching between usb device and internal soundcard that pulseaudio permits ) \nSo, to disable pulseaudio in a easily reversible way, run successively this 3 commands in a terminal:  \nmkdir ~/.pulse\necho autospawn=no > ~/.pulse/client.conf\npulseaudio -k\n\nthen reboot (logout could be ok ), and test .\nIf you want pulseaudio again, just run   in a terminal :\npulseaudio -D\nRun also\necho autospawn=yes > ~/.pulse/client.conf\nif you want  pulseaudio to be auto-launched at next reboot or logon.\nEDIT: Running pulseaudio in daemon mode is also ok , see this \n", "Q: USB devices are not detected in guest OS I have ubuntu as Guest OS in virtualbox.

The b43 driver is present by default, but needs you to install the proprietary firmware, which you can do by installing package linux-firmware-nonfree.  If for some reason that firmware doesn't work with the [4315], you can run the b43 cutter and installer packages you mentioned.  The end result should be a set of firmware files in directory /lib/firmware/b43   Wireless should pick up the driver on the next boot, provided you are not suppressing the b43 driver with a \"blacklist b43\" line in any file in /etc/modprobe.d.  Check for any such lines and comment them out.  They should be removed if you purge the STA package files, but check yourself just to be sure.\nI have no recent experience with the STA driver, but just using the Additional DRivers Dash selection should add it (when you are on a wired connection obviously).  In that case, there is no need for any firmware files since they are included in the STA driver itself (that's where the b43 cutter gets them from). \n", "Q: How can I make a local repository of Ubuntu MAAS PXE Images?

I asked this question on SO but they said it was offtopic.\nI want to use my GPU for debugging CUDA code and for that I need to change display to integrated only. This is the error I get when I try to debug it currently:\n\"All cuda devices are used for display and cannot be used while debugging\"\n\nI went into the BIOS and switched primary display to iGPU (the integrated one, HD4600).

There are several Windows machines connected in the office network. Only my system is running Ubuntu and SSH is also configured only in my system.\n\nA: If it's working from your internal network and not from outside, the normal reason is that the incoming port for you machine (port 22 by default) is closed by a firewall.

And one problem is that in spite of processes running inside the terminal, it closes immediately while clicking on the close button instead of asking by confirmation dialog!\nConsider I'm installing packages by apt-get and by-mistake if I click on close button then terminal close without confirmation! This does not seem OK.\nSo, is there any way to enable such type of confirmation dialog in xfce4-terminal?\n\nA: I could not find any such option. The closest you can get is by opening multiple tabs, for which XFCE Terminal does ask for confirmation. The option governing this is MiscConfirmClose in ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc (which was set to TRUE by default in my system).\n\nA: I doubt it. I just had a look through the available preferences and I don't see anything relevant. I also wouldn't expect it. This kind of confirmation dialogue is, IMO, exceedingly annoying. If I click on something, I clicked on something and I don't want my system to assume I don't know what I'm doing. If I didn't want to close the terminal I wouldn't have clicked on the little X button in the first place. This kind of hand-holding, \"the user is an idiot who needs to be protected\" is one of the things that annoy me most in the Windows world and I hate seeing it come to Linux.\nAnyway, rant over. If you really want this \"feature\", why not use gnome-terminal? There is no reason to use different terminal emulators with different desktop environments. For example, I use terminator which is based on gnome-terminal in both XFCE and Cinnamon. I have also used it in KDE, in Gnome and in WindowMaker. \n\nA: You can switch MiscTabCloseButtons from TRUE to FALSE in ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc. Then if You wan to close tab, You need to click right mouse button and select \"Close tab\"\n\nA: Add --hold at the end of xfce4 terminal launcher command\n\n", "Q: Macbook air 2014 13\" wireless driver just installed ubuntu on a macbook air, but cant seem to find bcmwl that actually finishes the installation.\nI can't connect via ethernet so that's not an option.\ncan someone give me a source or steps how to fix this ?\nsome details: BCM4360 802.11ac [14e4:43a0] (rev 03)\n\nA: Had the same problem on mine. \nMac air 6.2 (mid2013) Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nSpecs: (lspci -vnn | grep -i net)\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [14e4:43a0] (rev 03)\n\nThe broadcom drivers don't work for that wireless adaptor.\nI solved the problem by installing the wl driver.

Hi I'm new to ubuntu and I want to know how ubuntu is better than windows?sorry for asking such a generic question..still want to know the differences from askubuntu\n\nA: This question really can't be answered in any real way. Really, it's a matter of preference and opinion.\nEach person is going to have their own reasons for sticking with Ubuntu. Personally, I just love how configurable and customizable everything is. Don't like Unity (the default Ubuntu desktop)? Use Gnome Shell, KDE, LXDE, etc, etc. Don't like Gedit? Install Kate, Geany, or one of the many other text editors available. Want to log in with a USB drive? Install pamusb. And, while every program has its own configuration options, the vast majority of them are configured via simple text files and have more options than you'd ever need.\nMy first experience with Linux in general was with Knoppix STD (Security Tools Distribution). I loved how I was able to directly access a disk device and, say, wipe a bootloader or whatever.\nBut, in my opinion, the true power of Ubuntu (or Linux in general) is the out-of-the box functionality. Bash beats the hell out of the Windows command prompt by far. If you've ever tried to write a .BAT file, you know how ungodly difficult is. Bash is much more intuitive and far more flexible than the Windows command line. Tools like sed, awk, and other tools make scripting and text file editing and modification a breeze once you learn how to use them. You just don't get tools like these on Windows.\nFinally, my favorite thing about Ubuntu when I first started using it was the fact that pretty much everything you'd ever want to install was all available from one central location (Synaptic at the time, before the Software Center). This meant I didn't have to vet the trustworthiness of this program I was going to install. If it's in the Software Center, it's not spyware/a virus/going to harm my computer.\nSpeaking of viruses, most people can identify with the lack of viruses. I'm not saying that Linux is not susceptible to viruses, just far less so than Windows. Part of this is due to the security structure of Unix-like OSes. The other part of this equation is that, unlike Windows, a user might be running Gnome or KDE, or Firefox, Chrome or Konqueror. They could be using Evolution or Thudnerbird, or something else. In general, there's just too much variety in Linux for a virus/worm to be able to propagate reliably. Compare this to Windows where there's a very good chance people use the Windows shell (since it's a part of the kernel), Outlook, IE, etc. Since most Windows users use the same subset of programs, it makes them all more vulnerable to the same viruses.\nI mean, I could go on for a long time about why Ubuntu and Linux is better than Windows. This is the tip of the iceberg. If you have a more specific question regarding a certain area that you're curious about I'll be sure to fill it in for you.\n\nA: Your question seems off-topic & Primarily opinion based ; following may helps you:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwitchingToUbuntu/FromWindows/Philosophy\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy\n\nA: Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*is free\n\n*is free oriented, and usually there is no crappy add-ware seeking revenue from the OS\n\n*is open source, much more transparent, and you may basically view and modify whatever you want\n\n*relies on a very strong, reliable and efficient kernel (Linux)\n\n*is light, and runs on machines with less ram, disk compared to Windows 8.1\n\n*reads almost any file system, from Windows and from Mac\n\n*is quick to install, doesn't ask for keys, doesn't call-home-check\n\n*system-wise, all operations may be performed thanks to a terminal, script\n\n\nAlso since Ubuntu is free and mostly made by volunteers, manufacturers do not provide the same level of support (drivers...). So if there is one drawback that's the one: some devices may be a pita to work on Linux, some software may not have the convenience and ergonomics of paid competitors.\nBut, by using Ubuntu more and more, manufacturers will feel the need to provide Linux drivers.\n", "Q: Change in file does not commit I am editing the file wmem_max from /proc/sys/net/core using the command:\necho 83886080 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max\n\nThe value in the file changes, but when I restart the machine, the value reverts back to its old value. Why does the value I set not commit? Is there anymore command to commit the changes?\n\nA: You should add these values to the end of your /etc/sysctl.conf file, or create a file under /etc/sysctl.d. There are plenty of examples online, but this file is loaded with every boot, so the values are reloaded everytime. The values are most likely defaulted in the kernel config, so you need to reload them. \nIf you want to load them during the current boot without rebooting, just do: sysctl -p after your changes, and they will take effect immediately.

I want to run weechat constantly in the background so that I can ssh in and reattach to it via screen.\nI'm trying to accomplish this via the following file in /etc/init/chatscreen.conf:\ndescription     \"Run a persistent weechat within a screen\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nrespawn\n\nsetuid chat\nsetgid chat\n\nexec /usr/bin/screen -S chatscreen -Dm /usr/bin/weechat\n\nThen I run sudo initctl start chatscreen to start the service, which prints chatscreen start/running, process 3090.\nWhen I run sudo initctl status chatscreen a moment later, it prints chatscreen stop/waiting, and no screen or weechat processes are running according to htop.\ndmesg shows the following errors:\n[ 5649.430032] init: chatscreen main process ended, respawning\n[ 5649.454638] init: chatscreen main process ended, respawning\n[ 5649.476572] init: chatscreen main process ended, respawning\n...\n[ 5649.608818] init: chatscreen main process ended, respawning\n[ 5649.627409] init: chatscreen respawning too fast, stopped\n\nNo /var/log/upstart/chatscreen.log file exists.\nWhen I ssh in as the chat user and run /usr/bin/screen -S chatscreen -Dm /usr/bin/weechat in the shell, it executes as expected. (It runs the command and blocks. I can then start another ssh session, screen -r, /exit weechat, and the original screen command returns.)\nI'm running Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS 64-bit on DigitalOcean.\nEDIT: I also tried using dtach instead of screen. The only difference is that I had to use expect fork because dtach -n forks. dtach -n can be run without a terminal, which I thought might be a problem with screen.\nUnfortunately, I went through the same respawning cycle without any corresponding log file in /var/log/upstart. But dmesg did say: init: chatdtach main process (1073) terminated with status 1 multiple times.\n\nA: Upstart, even when using setuid, does not set the HOME environment variable. weechat tries to use this variable to look up its configuration directory when -d is not specified.\nweechat prints Error: unable to get HOME directory in response to this problem. However, it went unlogged because weechat had nowhere to output this error except for stdout, which screen/dtach did nothing with except dutifully return because the original process ended.\nYou can check if this is your problem by changing the exec line to this:\nexec /usr/bin/weechat\nIf /var/log/upstart/chatscreen.log says Error: unable to get HOME directory, then this was the problem.\nHere is a corrected upstart service file:\ndescription     \"Run a persistent weechat within screen\"\n\nrespawn\n\nsetuid chat\nsetgid chat\n\n# Not sure if screen needs this.\nenv LANG=en_US.utf8\n\nexec screen -S chatscreen weechat -d /home/chat/.weechat\n\nOr if you prefer the light-weight dtach:\ndescription     \"Run a persistent weechat within dtach\"\n\nrespawn\n\nsetuid chat\nsetgid chat\n\nexpect fork\n\nenv LANG=en_US.utf8\n\nexec dtach -n /home/chat/chatdtach.sock weechat -d /home/chat/.weechat\n\nThe LANG environment variable is so that weechat recognizes the detacher as supporting UTF-8. Without this, my weechat was displaying strange boxes on the right side instead of the vertical nick list separator. Change it to whatever locale you'd like to use.\nI'm not sure if screen requires LANG.

So you might have installed the new kernel, but the system would only be running it after a reboot.\nAfter you have installed a new kernel, especially manually, you will need to run sudo update-grub in a terminal window and reboot afterwards.\nIf the kernel 3.16 was installed correctly, be sure that it is chosen in GRUB2, when booting your PC. To be sure, you can select the \"Advanced option for Ubuntu\" option in grub. There all your installed kernels are present.\nBut the sudo update-grub part is crucial when manually installing kernels.\n", "Q: Shotwell : how to browse external library without external drive plugged-in My laptop hard drive is running out of space so I decided to put my entire photo library (33000+ pictures, 160 Gb) on a dedicated external hard drive.

As the price of internal storage continues to drop this approach becomes more and more attractive.\nStep 1) Clone your existing drive to your new drive by using the new drive as a target rather than an image file. Be careful to choose your target correctly sudo fdisk -l can help.\nStep 2) Physically install the new drive in your system to replace the old one.\nStep 3) Connect your external and copy your photo library back.\n", "Q: trouble in installing mysql workbench i am trying to install mysqlworkbench in my ubuntu using \nsudo dpkg -i mysql-workbench-community-6.0.9-1ubu1310-amd64.deb.3\n\nbut getting following errors\n(Reading database ... 188276 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to replace mysql-workbench-community 6.0.9-1ubu1310(using mysql-                workbench-   community-6.0.9-1ubu1310-amd64.deb.3) ...\nUnpacking replacement mysql-workbench-community ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mysql-workbench-community:\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libctemplate2; however:\nPackage libctemplate2 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.35.9); however:\nVersion of libglib2.0-0 on system is 2.32.4-0ubuntu1.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libglibmm-2.4-1c2a (>= 2.36.2); however:\nVersion of libglibmm-2.4-1c2a on system is 2.32.0-0ubuntu1.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a (>= 1:2.24.0); however:\nPackage libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libpango-1.0-0 (>= 1.18.0); however:\nPackage libpango-1.0-0 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libpangocairo-1.0-0 (>= 1.14.0); however:\nPackage libpangocairo-1.0-0 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libpcrecpp0 (>= 7.7); however:\nPackage libpcrecpp0 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libtinyxml2.6.2; however:\nPackage libtinyxml2.6.2 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on libzip2 (>= 0.10); however:\nPackage libzip2 is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on python-paramiko; however:\nPackage python-paramiko is not installed.\nmysql-workbench-community depends on python-pysqlite2; however:\nPackage python-pysqlite2 is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing mysql-workbench-community (--install):\ndependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info ...\nProcessing triggers for hicolor-icon-theme ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nmysql-workbench-community\n\n\nA: I think you're going at it the wrong way.

I have a productive Ubuntu Server LTS webserver (\"classical\" LAMP) running 12.04.5 LTS (up-to-date, regular apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade). I can only access it via SSH (rented server with root access).

I know this depends on a lot of things, but a rough time-scale would be nice to know beforehand (it's very fast hardware and network connection).\n\nLast time I did this it took just over 1/2 an hour. On a more than average internet connection. But indeed this will depend on a lot of things. If you have a desktop installed it will take longer. If you have more software installed than me it will take longer. If you have less installed it will take less time. \n\nAre reboots needed inbetween (-> SSH-only-access)?\n\nNot when I did it and as far as I know the upgrade is done as 1 action. So a reboot at the end will be needed. \n\nIs constant user-input required?\n\nNo. But you probably want to watch most of the process as it happens. \n\nWill the updated important services (Apache, PHP, MySQL) just run or can I expect to have to update a lot of configuration files (if so which are likely needing adjustments)?\n\nIt did for me: apache and mysql ran instantly afterwards; but this largely depends on your setup; if you used deprecated options that got deleted in 14.04 those might give you troubles.\nBoth apache and mysql show clear messages if it does crash. \nOne thing I would advice: stop any services yourself and make a backup of the configuration files before you start the upgrade. Make a database dump, backup my.conf and /etc/apache2/conf, sites- etc. \n\nAre there any other known problems that occur often on a big LTS upgrade?\n\nYes, power outage. It seems to be very popular just when you start an upgrade for power outages to happen. So as with any major changes of your system: backup and check that you can restor it.\nOne other thing: after I did the upgrade on 1 machine we made an educated guess to what it would cost our company if the upgrade would bork. We decided it would be cheapest and safest to buy a new server and change the old one to a fallbackup server. That also made the upgrade easier: we could mess with apache setting, mysql settings and restore our backups. It took longer than an hour (days) but it was possible to do this during daytime and when we wanted it. \n\nA: These upgrades should take less than an hour, maybe 30 minutes, but that's only the upgrade, not the testing and fixing afterwards. \nYou can expect several questions about configuration files: overwrite or keep the old ones. In general you should keep the old ones, otherwise Apache config will be overwritten etc. You better make sure to backup those config files. How big is your /etc folder? Back it up with proper rights (sudo cp -rp /etc /etc-backup). Same goes for the var folder. Check if there is enough space to do this. \nApache or Mysql or any other service can stop working with your current settings. Databases may not upgrade properly. PHP upgrade may cause problems. Check your mailserver. \nMy advice: use a local 12.04 VM in Virtualbox, install your website, check if mysql, php and apache are the same version. Check the mailserver and if the website or a cronjob sends out mail to customers, disable the mail, or change all mail addresses in the test environment to make sure customers don't get fake test mails. Make snapshots along the way so you can go back one or two steps when you make a mistake. \nYou can choose to use a desktop version of 12.04. That will give you the possibility to use Firefox in the VM etc. A desktop can make things a lot easier, and my guess is it won't harm the server setup for testing. This is what I do, but you might want not to. \nThen with that local 12.04 VM, make the upgrade. See what problems occur. Does the website still run? Do you see errors in the logging? Be aware that this test is not an absolute guarantee that the same procedure will work on the live machine. But you will probably catch most problems. \nIn these cases \"the cloud\" has its advantages, using a VM in the cloud I mean. You can make a snapshot before upgrading. Then upgrade and go back if it goes wrong. Or you can keep the original machine running, use a snapshot to create a second VM, upgrade that to test etc. \n", "Q: Sharing public folder between Ubuntu machines, via \"Personal File Sharing\" Launching Personal File Sharing from dash, the application opens with the message: \"this feature cannot be enabled because the required packages are not installed on your system\".

I want to install Gnome 3 for ubuntu 14.04. However I want to know what will happen to my existing applications like empathy, cheese, wine etc as well as my installed software through wine. Will I be able to access them or do I have to install them all over again. I am confused because the Gnome official website mentions something like this \nHundreds of applications are available for GNOME. They enable people to ....\n\nand then mentions a list of applications like banshee, cheese etc which gives an impression that these applications are different from those available for unity and hence need to be installed separately or again. ( I dont want my wine softwares and other apps to break after installation)\nAlso after installing the new desktop environment, will the underlying functionality change as well, like installing new software through software centre and terminal, or will it be the same (I mean, to install new software, I'll use software centre or a dedicated app store for gnome)? And what about drivers like wifi and display ?\n\nA: Every Desktop Environment comes with its own set of software. However, Unity and GNOME Shell actually share most of them.\nWhen you install new packages, and there are conflicting packages installed, the package manager will ask you what to do. (Btw. I don't know whether USC does so, I prefer using Synaptic, an APT frontend) At least apt-get and Synaptic do so.\nSince Unity and GNOME Shell (what you mean by \"GNOME 3\") are both shells for the actual GNOME 3, they share most of their packages.\nIt wonders me how you're going to install GNOME Shell. If you want to install the package ubuntu-gnome-desktop, it will install all of the packages that are incuded in a full GNOME Shell desktop. If you, however, only want to install GNOME Shell, without all this additional software, you should only install gnome-shell and gnome-session.\nEven though Unity and GNOME Shell are so close, be warned: Multiple desktop environments can mess each other up.\nThe programs you installed by yourself, like WineHQ, should remain unaffected by this change, unless they conflict with a package from GNOME Shell. In this case, Synaptic will ask for your confirmation; what Ubuntu Software Center will do, I don't know. Also, the core system (Linux kernel, Debian stuff, drivers, ...) will certainly not be affected.\n\nPS: A personal side note from me: Even though I can't tell you what DE to use, I recommend you to first try GNOME Shell from a Live System. Many users have problems with the \"unholy mess that is GNOME 3\" (quote by Linus Torvalds).\n", "Q: xorg driver doesn't use my radeon videocard 14.04 I have a Dell Inspiron 5521 laptop with a Radeon HD 8730M videocard, running Ubuntu 14.04\nHowever, when I use the X.Org X server open source drivers from xserver-xorg-video-ati, the computer uses Intel Ivybridge Mobile for graphics.\nglxinfo has the line: OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile x86/MMX/SSE2.\nlspci | grep -i radeon gives the following result:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Long story short...\nI had to install a small server app running in a VM on one of this company's PC. Both computers are running Windows XP (with legacy softwares, so upgrading is not possible), and buying an extra PC is limited at the moment. So, I converted the host's Windows on one of them into a VM, and installed Lubuntu. Then imported the server app and everything works fine; everything is almost transparent to the user, except for the start up and shot down processes.\nThe problem\nI was wondering how I could start both VMs on the host's startup, then shutdown the PC when the Windows XP's VM shots down? Right now, the workers are doing this manually, but I would like to automate this process.\nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu should have a user configured to log in on start up -> done!\n\n*The server app VM should start at logon -> unsure\n\n*The Windows XP VM should start at logon -> unsure\n\n*The server app VM should save state and be closed automatically when the Windows XP machine is terminated -> don't know\n\n*Lubuntu should shutdown when all VM are paused/closed. -> don't know\nThe system is running on Lubuntu 14.04 with VirtualBox 4.3.x.\n\nA: I would go with a combination of cron job and usage of vboxmanage via bash scripts.\nI'd have a bash script which would start up the virtual machines and fire up a cron job for checking the status of the machines.\nThe script should look something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvboxmanage startvm \"Server App VM name\"\nvboxmanage startvm \"Windows XP VM name\"\ncrontab ~/check_vms_and_shutdown_job.txt\n\nLet's say we save it as start_vms_and_cronjob.sh. Remember to chmod +x it, so it can be actually executed.\nYou might wonder about the check_vms_and_shutdown_job.txt file. It's a text file containing information about a job that should be run at certain intervals. In this example we placed it in the user's home folder and it should read:\n*/5 * * * * ~/check_vms_and_shutdown.sh\n\nThis file should have a new line at the end of the line (press enter before saving ;) ) What this file does is that it describes a cron job which is run every 5 minutes and it executes a bash script.\nNow what is this check_vms_and_shutdown.sh script you might ask? Well, here's the whole point. It should say:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif vboxmanage list runningvms | grep \"Windows XP VM name\"\nthen\n    echo \"Windows XP still running.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Windows XP shut down. Shutting down the rest.\"\n    vboxmanage controlvm \"Server App VM name\" savestate\n    crontab -r \n    shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nNow what it does, that it will check if there is the XP virtual machine running. If it's not, it will then order the server app virtual machine to save it's state. After that the cronjob will be removed and the system shut down. Remember to chmod +x and here we also placed the file in user's home folder.\nFor convenience and better usage on the purpose you might also want to run the virtualboxes headless and have their usage be done through remote display.\nNow add the start_vms_and_cronjob.sh into your startup applications and you should be set.\nSo what we have here is:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the system starts, the virtual machines are started by a shell script and a new cron job (running a shell script) is created from a cron job rule txt file.\n\n*In every 5 minutes the cron job runs the script which checks if the XP virtual machine is still running and if not it will save the other virtual machine, remove the cron job and shutdown the system.\n\n\nHope this helps you to configure just what you need. \n\nA: These are the steps to achieve the tasks outlined. The VM guest with the server application will be called \"ServerApp\", the Windows machine \"WindowsXP\" below. Replace these with their real names. \nThe method below involves creating a custom Xsession on the host machine. This has the advantage that we may strip down this session to only load applications we need for running our virtual machines (we likely won't need a full blown desktop for this). In addition, using the wait methods inbuilt to VirtualBox will not require any additional loops to be called for monitoring the VM states.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a user for running the virtual machine.\n\n*Install the guest additions to the guest \n\n*Switch to fullscreen with Host + F while running the VM.\n\n*Define a custom Lubuntu session on the host:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file in /usr/share/xsessions and name it e.g. WindowsVM.desktop with following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=WindowsXP # or any other sensible name\nComment=Custom Xsession running a VM \nExec=/etc/X11/Xsession\n\n\n*Make this file executable. This session will call ~/.xsession on login.\n\n\n*Create the executable session startup script named ~/.xsession in above user's HOME:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/lxsession -s Lubuntu LXDE &\nVBoxManage startvm \"ServerApp\" --type headless\nVBoxManage startvm \"WindowsXP\"\nVBoxManage guestproperty set RUNNING 1 --flags TRANSIENT\nVBoxManage guestproperty wait \"WindowsXP\" RUNNING\nVBoxManage controlvm \"SeverApp\" savestate\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Stop\n\n\n*Choose the custom session in 4. on login.\nThe tricky bit is to get the guest property RUNNING (or any other name we choose) deleted from the virtual machine as it is not so transient as the specs suggest. Unfortunately it will survive a shutdown/poweroff of the virtual machine.\nWe therefore have to add the following command using VBoxcontrol.exe (installed with the guest additions) to the guest Windows at the end of its shutdown routine (or from a shutdown script we put there):\nVBoxControl.exe guestproperty set RUNNING\n\nThis will then terminate the wait state to proceed with saving the \"ServerAPP\" then poweroff the host.\nAn alternative to this is starting a Windows application on the guest to wait for this application to terminate before we shutdown the machines and poweroff the host. Then we'd replace the two set guestproperty commands in the script by a line similar to this:\nVBoxManage --nologo guestcontrol \"WindowsXP\" execute --image \"C:\\\\full\\\\path\\\\to\\\\program.exe\" --username <windowsuser> --password <password> --wait-exit --wait-stdout\n\nSee VirtualBox Manual for limitations, and for further details on how to set this up for a passwordless account in Windows.\n\nCommands of script in step 5. explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin/lxsession -s Lubuntu LXDE\nstarts a Lubuntu session (replace with any other customized Xsession if applicable)\n\n*VBoxManage startvm \"ServerApp --type headless\"\nstarts the virtual machine running the server App in headless mode (i.e. no display)\n\n*VBoxManage startvm \"WindowsXP\"\nstarts the virtual machine running Windows (fullscreen or any other resolution as defined on last run)  \n\n*VBoxManage guestproperty set \"WindowsXP\" RUNNING 1 --flags TRANSIENT\nsets a property RUNNING for the Windows machine that can be controlled from the guest OS  \n\n*VBoxManage guestproperty wait \"WindowsXP\" RUNNING\nwaits for the property RUNNING to be removed from the guest Windows   \n\n*VBoxManage controlvm \"SeverApp\" savestate\nterminates the server App VM in savestate  \n\n*dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" \\\n/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Stop\nterminates the Lubuntu host (poweroff state) without user interaction.  \n\nA: You could set up an Init.d/Systemd script like this one:\n#! /bin/sh\n# /etc/init.d/vbox\n\n#Edit these variables!

Instead, GRUB now makes you solve the underlying issues that prevented it from detecting the OS, which can be a pain in the smurf. \nNow, that said, there are several things that can prevent GRUB from detecting your XP drive. From my research, this usually indicates that there is something wrong with the partition itself. You should try and run chkdsk from windows or a windows repair disk. If those fail, please review the forum post below and see if you are having a similar issue. Most likely, Arch damaged a small boot partition that GRUB uses to detect the OS. \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9826152\nAs always, back up everything prior to beginning these steps. \nGood luck! \n Geary\n", "Q: Turn an external hard drive into a live usb So the computer I am working with doesn't have a hard drive nor a CD drive and I intend to boot it from a \"live external hard drive\" but when I try to format it using UUI (Universal USB Installer) the drop down list doesn't recognize the hard drive as a flash drive. Is there a way to fix this or another software I could use to format my external hard drive?\n\nA: The UUI looks for USB flash drives and there is a diference between USB flash drive and USB HDD. To be able to use your USB HDD as a live HDD, open UUI and ensure that the \"Now showing all drives(BE CAREFUL)\" check box is checked. Then you should be able to view your USB HDD in the drop down.

I've looked over the web for a few days and I can't seem to fix this problem.\nI have removed eclipse with autoremove and remove and done a clean and autoclean but that doesn't seem to blow-eclipse away totally and I think that is what I need to do to get it going again... remove and delete all the configuration files... something is incompatible or in the wrong format for the eclipse version that I have now and what I was using under 12.04?\nHere's the start of the sad story:\nI knew eclipse was going to be a problem when I started it and it complained about the workspace being in-used or not existing... (it did exist and was not in use... and I could find no lock file)  After that I kept 'browsing' over to the workplace and eclipse would crash.\nSo, I did an sudo apt-get install eclipse... and apt-get said it was selecting previously unselected package and acted like it was re-installing eclipse without downloading anything.  After that eclipse would start and when I pointed it to my workspace folder, it went to it and opened the projects that I had previously been work on.... but I noticed all the '.c' files had the icon for Geany...

Follow the steps from this this answer.\nThe advantage installing with apt-get:\n\n\n*\n\n*one single sudo apt-get install eclipse command to install eclipse\n\n\nThe advantage installing your own:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can choose what version of eclipse you want. Be it the latest greatest or something older.\n\n*You get to choose when you want to update. Updating in the middle of a urgent project isn't fun.\n\n*Sometimes newer eclipse need more RAM, CPU, HDD space.\n\n*Eclipse is keeping itself up-to-date if you want. It is also keeping tab of the installed plugins as well. So you don't need apt-get to keep that one updated too.\n\n*Eclipse will tell's you when there is a new version of itself and gives you a choice to update it now or later.\n\n\nI've been working about 4 years with Java on eclipse (also Intellij IDEA) on Linux on day job. Using the official version was never a option as there were always plugins I needed to use that only worked with that special version.\nInstalling eclipse manually might seem cumbersome the first time. But once you've done it it's very easy the next time.\n\nA: If you are using Eclipse Luna, this will crash when attempting to create a new java project or another type of work.\nTo solve this (worked in my case), do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings\n\n*Go to Application Appearance and open the GTK tab\n\n*On GTK Themes, in GTK2 Theme, select another different to oxigen-gtk, like Clearlooks\n\n*Apply\n\n*Exit and make sure Eclipse is closed\n\n*Logout an login again to make some visual changes to take effect\n\n*After login, open Eclipse and test.\n\n\nI'm using Eclipse Luna 4.4.1, Clearlooks as GTK Theme, on Kubuntu 14.04.1 x64 and java version \"1.7.0_72\".\nI hope this help :-)\n\nA: This is caused by a known bug that appears when upgrading from 3.7 to 3.8 of eclipse (which a distribution upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 effectively does)  Also current versions of eclipse (4.4+) will have similar issues, check this bug report:\nhttps://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=339174\nThe work-around is essentially to install the gtk engines and then go into system settings for x windows and de-select the gtk engines... and then relaunch eclipse.  \nEven though this bug is against 4.4, the same fix worked for me with 3.8.\nThanks for the help! \nP.S. Mike, just going off grid with the eclipse version does not fix this, nor is this a variant of 'installing eclipse'.  I do not appreciate your spamming this question with unsuitable and plain wrong answers for 'rep-points'.\n", "Q: Mounting external hard disk for all users at start up in ubuntu 14.04 Hi I am new to Ubuntu and recently installed 14.04 LTS.

What is happening presently is, the HDD is getting mounted for the user who logs in which gives access permissions to only that user. By adding an entry in the fstab, the partition will be mounted by root with access to all users. this r/w access can be controlled later on.\nsudo blkid lists down all partitions available on your system. Note down the UUID of the NTFS partition that you want to mount at boot. In your case, it seems 00148BDE148BD4D6\nnow create a folder, for example sudo mkdir /media/ExtHDD01. This is the folder where your external HDD partition will be mounted at. This folder will be owned by root. To give other users permission to r/w into this folder we need to give the proper permissions. so chmod -R 777 /media/ExtHDD01 would be good enough. Now you need to edit your fstab file. to do so, type the following command.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\ngo to the bottom of the file and add the following line there.\nUUID=00148BDE148BD4D6 /media/ExtHDD01/    ntfs-3g        auto,user,rw 0 0\n\nReboot system and you should be good to go.\nYou can follow the same procedure for any number of HDDs.\n\nA: GUI method\n\n\n*\n\n*plug in the drive.\n\n*Go to Disks in the desktop finder (or sudo gnome-disks on a terminal)\n\n*Select the correct disk in the left column.\n\n*Click the gear icon \n\n*Select edit mount options\n\n*Turn off\n\n*Check both mount at startup and show user interface\nThats it!\n", "Q: What to do about Black Screen w/ white cursor after desktop login, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 Bit I have read certain NVidia graphic cards being not-compatible.

You can obtain the display names using the xrandr command:\nxrandr\nxsetwacom --set 11 MapToOutput DVI-0\n\nThis way you don't need to mess up with any numbers. Please also mind that each time you set the above parameter, the orientation needs to be set again using the Rotate parameter.\nIn my particular setup I have two displays and I made a small script to switch the wacom between the displays.

I have lenovo z50-70. \nMy grub file has \"quiet splash\" too but I simply appended my swap partition beside it. \n\nA: I was having the same problem.\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\n...nothing.\n>~$ dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\" /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Hibernate\n> method return sender=:1.44 -> dest=:1.303 reply_serial=2\n\n...nothing.\nLooking around, I found a suggestion to check the pm-hibernate log:\n>~$ head /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n> Initial commandline parameters: \n> Wed Apr 29 22:38:06 PDT 2015: Running hooks for hibernate.\n> Running hook /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/000kernel-change hibernate\n>  hibernate: kernel update inhibits hibernate (/var/run/do-not-\n>  hibernate present)\n\nAh! So the system needs to be rebooted because there was a kernel update. It would be great to get some kind of notification of the fact, instead of ...nothing.\nBTW, to tell if you need to reboot:\n>~$ ls -l /var/run/reboot-required\n> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32 Apr 29 18:28 /var/run/reboot-required\n\nBasically, if that file exists, a reboot is required. \nI can't tell you what will happen if you put the system into hibernation if you need to reboot due to a kernel update, but I was able to hibernate immediately when I did this:\n>~$ sudo rm /var/run/do-not-hibernate\n\n\nA: As you put the link here, swsusp troubleshooting part of this worked for me.\nFirst method\nFirst, you need to check if your swap partition configured correctly. To perform this, initially, run sudo blkid and copy the UUID of the partition which has the type of swap (maybe it's /dev/sda6), I'll call it <swap uuid> from now on. Before continuing, you should make a copy as a backup from /etc/fstab:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.back\n\nNow open /etc/fstab file using such a file editor as nano (run it as root). Then, comment every line you see swap phrase in it by adding a # at the beginning of the line. Here, add this line to the end of file, where <swap uuid> is the value you found with sudo blkid above:\nUUID=<swap uuid> none swap sw 0 0\n\nSave the file. Maybe the problem with swap partition was fixed.\nNote: Your swap partition size should be greater than your RAM size; unless you may have problems with hibernating.\nSecond method\nFrom the link above, the quoted description, with some changes (see above for using sudo blkid to find the value to use for <swap uuid> below):\n\nProblem: The computer goes to hibernate, OK. But after power-on it is loading as if no hibernate state was saved.\nIn the case of grub2:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You should make a backup. Run:\n  \n  \n  sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.back\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open /etc/default/grub;\n  \n*Find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= line. These are the option added to the regular boot menu choices;\n  \n*Add the resume=UUID=<swap uuid> option to the list like this: \nBefore:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nAfter (note the quotations):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash resume=UUID=<swap uuid>\"\nNote: You might not want to change any options before adding resume (e.g. changing nosplash option to splash). However, I recommend you to use both quiet and splash options.\n\n  \n*Save the file.\n  \n*In the terminal, execute the following command (to actually enable the new configuration settings)\n  \n  \n  sudo update-grub2\n\nNow, try sudo pm-hibernate command to hibernate your computer, then try booting again. Your problem may be fixed.\nHope it helps someone!\n", "Q: Can I remove upstart-* from startup When I startup my computer I have 80+ processes running - just under my name.\nOf these, I have 4 that match the regex upstart-*:\nupstart-dbus-bridge\nupstart-dbus-bridge\nupstart-file-bridge\nupstart-event-bridge\n\nis it safe to kill these?

Installing dual boot of Win 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS on ASUS Vivobook S400CA I am not the most experienced in installing Ubuntu, and I have heard that installing Ubuntu on ASUS Vivobook is problematic. Is anyone here has experience in doing this?\nI tried to follow the instructions here - ubuntu-on-touch-screen-laptop-setting.\nBut at the installation type screen I don't have the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1, I only have the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase disk and install Ubuntu\n\n*Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\n\n*Use LVM with new Ubuntu installation\n\n*Something else\n\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: \nEdit I'm re-writing this answer to match the edited question Edit\nThis issue is caused by UEFI Boot. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) (pronounced as an initialism U-E-F-I or like \"unify\" without the n)[a] is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is meant to replace the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface, originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers. In practice, most UEFI firmware images provide legacy support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even without another operating system\nEducation out of the way, the steps to work around this issue are long, but not overly painful. Due to their length, I am going to very briefly summarize them here:\n\n1) Backup Windows\n2) Create your Installation Media\n3) Shrink your windows partition\n4) Turn off Secure Boot\n5) Install Ubuntu\n\nThe guide has a lot of instructions here that I didn't need the last time Installed. So before I give you the link to follow, here's my caveat: If the installer gives you the option of installing alongside Windows, use that instead of this guide. If you still don't see it, then follow the guide. \nAll that said, here is the link: http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html\nI also recommend logging into the Ubuntu IRC channel during the install. If you have any questions, you can connect right with the community rather than having to wait for replies here. Should they walk you through different steps, please let us know what worked for you so that we can clean up this question. \n~ Geary\n\nA: \nBut at the installation type screen I don't have the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1, I only have the following options:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Erase disk and install Ubuntu\n  \n*[…]\n  \n*Something else\n  \n\nThis isn't enough information to draw a conclusion. If you can run GParted and it detects the partition table and individual partitions, then this is an issue with the Ubuntu installer and you should use manual partitioning (\"something else\").\nIf existing partitions are not detected there might be another issue, be sure to boot the installation media in UEFI mode on UEFI machines (I recommend this). If partitions are still not getting detected disable secure boot (this shouldn't be necessary as 14.04 installed just fine in my tests with secure boot enabled).\n", "Q: show limited git diff status in ls, only in git directories This might be an odd problem, but I would like to override the behavior of ls when in a git directory.\nI want to extract some diff statistics from the last commit, and append it to the bottom of the ls. When in the root of the git project, I want to make a specific prompt like this:\napp/\ntest/\n.gitignore\ntest.py\nrun.py\nREADME.md\n\n+ 11 lines\n- 3 lines\nLast commit: \"add a new test for deployment\" (Oct 14, 2014)\n\nWhen deeper than the root, I want to create a prompt like this (say I cd'd to test/ and then use the ls command):\ntest/\n├── __init__.py\n├── test_deploy.py\n└── test_add_user.py (+3 lines since last commit)\n\nBonus points: colorized green/red for plus/minus lines and nice uniform tabbing on git info.\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nA: First, in order to create a custom ls, the easiest way is to proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory $HOME/bin\n\n*Add $HOME/bin to your PATH. To do this, open the file ~/.bashrc in your favorite text editor, and add the following line to the end:\nexport PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nNote that it is important that you prepend $HOME/bin to your PATH, so that executables in there will take precedence over other executables with the same name along your PATH (such as, in your case, the ls command)\n\n*Create a file $HOME/bin/ls with the contents that I'll post below.\n\n*Make it executable: chmod 755 $HOME/bin/ls.\n\n*You will probably need to restart your terminal.\n\n\nSecond, your new $HOME/bin/ls should behave like so: It checks if the current directory is a git repository, and\n\n\n*\n\n*if no, it simply delegates to the normal /bin/ls executable.\n\n*if yes, it creates that output you asked for, depending on whether the current folder is the root of the git repository or if it is deeper.\n\n\nI quickly hacked such a script together for you. It's by no means perfect, but it should be pretty close to what you want, and you can easily work your way from there. :-)\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# determine if we're in a git repo, what the root dir is, and assign it to GIT_ROOT, all in one swoop\nGIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)\n\n# if not in git repo, relay to normal ls\nif (( $? )); then\n  /bin/ls \"$@\"\n\n# if in git repo, are we in root dir?\nelif [ \"x$GIT_ROOT\" = \"x$PWD\" ]; then\n  # first, normal ls with 1 file per line, also pass along other parameters\n  /bin/ls -1 \"$@\"\n  echo\n  # a few git stats\n  GIT_DIFF=$(git diff --stat | tail -1)\n  # any insertions?\n  echo $GIT_DIFF | grep insertion >/dev/null\n  if (( ! $? )); then\n    # bonus points: color in green\n    echo -e \"\\e[0;32m+ $(echo $GIT_DIFF | sed 's/.*, \\([[:digit:]]\\+\\) insertion.*/\\1/;') lines\\e[0m\"\n  fi\n  # any deletions?\n  echo $GIT_DIFF | grep deletion >/dev/null\n  if (( ! $? )); then\n    # bonus points: color in red\n    echo -e \"\\e[0;31m- $(echo $GIT_DIFF | sed 's/.*, \\([[:digit:]]\\+\\) deletion.*/\\1/;') lines\\e[0m\"\n  fi\n  # Finally, display last commit message and date\n  git log -1 --pretty='Last commit: \"%s\" (%ad)'\n\n# otherwise, we're depper in a git repo\nelse\n  echo -e \"\\e[1;34m${PWD##*/}\\e[0m\"\n  IFS=$'\\n'\n  for file in $(tree -C | tail -n +2 | head -n -2); do\n    filename=$(echo $file | cut -d\" \" -f 2-)\n    echo -n $file\n    # a few git stats\n    GIT_DIFF=$(git diff --stat \"$(echo $filename | sed -r \"s/\\x1B\\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[m|K]//g\")\")\n    # any insertions?\n    echo $GIT_DIFF | grep insertion >/dev/null\n    if (( ! $? )); then\n      # bonus points: color in green\n      echo -ne \" \\e[0;32m(+ $(echo $GIT_DIFF | sed 's/.*, \\([[:digit:]]\\+\\) insertion.*/\\1/;') lines since last commit)\\e[0m\"\n    fi\n    # any deletions?\n    echo $GIT_DIFF | grep deletion >/dev/null\n    if (( ! $? )); then\n      # bonus points: color in red\n      echo -ne \" \\e[0;31m(- $(echo $GIT_DIFF | sed 's/.*, \\([[:digit:]]\\+\\) deletion.*/\\1/;') lines since last commit)\\e[0m\"\n    fi\n    echo\n  done\n\nfi\n\nDemo\nNote: output is nicely colored, though clearly this won't show here.\n$ ls\napp\nREADME.md\nrun.py\ntest\ntest.py\n\n+ 11 lines\n- 3 lines\nLast commit: \"add a new test for deployment\" (Fri Nov 21 04:20:37 2014 +0100)\n$ cd test/\n$ ls\ntest\n├── bla\n├── __init__.py\n├── test_add_user.py (+ 3 lines since last commit)\n└── test_deploy.py\n\n", "Q: Deluge daemon 'Starting up' after uninstall Okay, let see if I can keep this short and simple.\nI switched from deluge-daemon to transmission-daemon a few months ago on my Ubuntu 14.04 server VM.

Then you just set the script referred to here to run XMBC when the HDMI is plugged in. Please pay special attention to whether or not your card records when the HDMI is disconnected. You could then design a script to:\n1) Verify that XMBC is running\n2) Verify that the HDMI port is still connected using the same UDEV script in the link\n3) Kill XMBC gracefully should the HDMI port be unplugged\nThis assumes that you want the XMBC daemon killed when the HDMI gets unplugged, of course. \n", "Q: Setting correct permissions First of all let me say that i am almost new to Linux so please be patient :)\nI have an Ubuntu 14.0.4 running on my Systems.\nWhat i am trying to do is:\nOn my system there are sabnzbd and plex running.\nsabnzbd is running as root and plex has an own user (plex) with an own group (plex).\nWhat i need is that the user plex, myuser and also sabnzbd (root) have read, write and execute permission at /media and also all subfolders and files.\nI studied now a lot of stuff at the internet and tried my luck with chmod; chown; the /etc/group file; and many more but i am to stupid to get it to work.\nCan someone tell me what i need?\n\nA: For a little more secure approach I'd recommend creating a group for those 3 users and then chown'ing the directory by the group.\n1. sudo groupadd mygroup\n\n2. sudo usermod -aG {group-name} username\n\nIn your case it'd be \nsudo usermod -aG mygroup plex ; sudo usermod -aG mygroup root ; sudo usermod -aG mygroup myuser\n\n3. chown -Rf :mygroup /media\n\n\nA: You just need to perform this following command:\nsudo chmod -Rf 777 /media\n\nwhere:\n-Rf will force change the permissions recursively.\n\"777\" will get for root, root group and others the permission for read, write and execute everything on the directory.\n", "Q: I seem no longer to be a sudoer On Sunday I let my son watch Netflix on my laptop as I was ill and in bed so couldn't watch it downstairs on the television with him.

You would need to move sda5 to the right so that the free space precedes it and follows sda5 instead.\n\nA: You have to unmount a partition first in order to resize it.  If you are resizing your system partition you need to boot from a live cd/usb and then resize it.  Gparted is included in Ubuntu 14.04/14.10.  You can also create a standalone Gparted bootable cd/usb from the Gparted ISO found here:  http://gparted.org/download.php.\n:) Best of luck!\n\nA: To join the empty space to the partition that you want (sda9) you will need to first move partition sda5 so that the empty space is contiguous, or next to, the target partition.\nUsing gparted, select /dev/sda5 and choose the option resize/move - change the value in the box reading Free space preceding to 11720 to get 11.72 GiB.  This will place the empty space available before partition /dev/sda5, and next to partition /dev/sda9.  When this operation has completed, you will be able to choose the resize/move option of /dev/sda9 and increase the size of that partition to fill the unallocated space.\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu 14.04 server on a powerPC (IBM power5 eserver) I am trying to install ubuntu-14.04-server-powerpc on my IBM power5 eserver (p5 type 9117-570).

I loaded Ubuntu 14.04 to what used to be a Windows Media Center PC computer. The install went without a hitch. However, after completing all the updating to get the system current. I have encountered problems.\nThe machine is as follows (per System Settings-Details)\nMemory: 495.3 MiB\nProcessor: Intel® Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.53GHz\nGraphics: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits)\nOS Type: 32-bit (I chose '32 bit' due to small RAM configuration)\nDisk: 117.5 GB\nIn applications with lists of things in windows (eg. System Monitor-Processes, Ubuntu Software Center-Installed Applications), the lists (both icons and text) disappear if the mouse moves over the icon/text area in the window area. Scrolling the screen using the mouse brings the text and icons back, until the mouse moves over the window area again.\nIn the System Settings window only some of my icons appear. When I hover my mouse over the 'missing' icon in most cases it shows up, but as my mouse moves away the icon disappears, again.\nI have already tried 'Gnome Fallback' but that did not help either problem. Things seem to work OK within a browser so I'm thinking it might a graphics card or driver issue???? I'm a Ubuntu neophyte so please don't bury me in 'geek' talk.\nAny suggestions of things to try would be appreciated....... Thanks........ Phil\n\nA: I had a very similar problem with disappearing text, especially in synaptic. In my case the problem disappeared (and the text reappeared) after switching \"Subpixel-Geometry\" to be found in the font menu of Appearance from whatever it was before to \"none\".

But as soon as I got to the part where it asked about the installation option, it said I didn't have an operating system. I already have windows 8 and want to install Ubuntu alongside it on a separate hard drive. How shall I go about fixing this problem?\n\nA: Well, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is usually a third choice where you can partition your hard drive with gparted during the installation. Then, you can install Ubuntu on the new partition.\n\n*You can just create a new Ubuntu install disk.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: Connecting Multiple Ubuntu Orange Boxes I would like to create a cluster of twenty machines and would like to know how this could work with two 10-node Ubuntu Orange Boxes. In the marketing material it says that the boxes can be \"daisy-chained\" together.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an optimum way to connect them? Is a single ethernet cable the only option?\n\n*Can all the nodes on box 2 be controlled through maas on box 1?\n\n*What about bottlenecks, would there be a limit of 1Gb/s between the boxes? \n\n*How can I get box2 to accept IP addresses from box1?\n\n*What if I get a third box? :)\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Yes, this is all very, very doable!  In fact, I've done it myself (as the lead architect behind the Orange Box).\nThe only gotcha, is that typically, the Orange Box is shipped from TranquilPC with each node's AMT (out of band power management system) hard coded to static IP addresses.  Node1 get's IP 10.14.4.11, Node2 get's IP 10.14.4.12, etc. to Node9 with 10.14.4.19.  That's on each individual Orange Box shipped.\nWhat you'll want to do is instead configure each node in Orange Box #2 to have different static IPs, perhaps 10.14.4.20 - 10.14.4.29, and perhaps Orange Box #3 to have 10.14.4.30 - 10.14.4.39.\nThat'll take you a few minutes on each node to setup, and you'll need a keyboard/mouse/monitor, and you'll have to login to BIOS/AMT/MEBx to set this up.  But you only have to do it once per node.\nEverything else should \"just work\".  MAAS and Juju can both handle hundreds of nodes easily.\nA single ethernet cable will definitely connect them.  All nodes will be registered and boot off of Node0 on your first Orange Box (or wherever you have MAAS/Juju installed).\nThere will be 1 gigabit of bandwidth between the two gigabit switches.  You could, perhaps look into port aggregation on the D-Link switch (which is listening on 10.90.90.90), to combine a couple of ports.  Note that I have not, personally, tried this, but theoretically, it might work :-)\n", "Q: When I run apt-get update command I am getting these errors\nW: Failed to fetch http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/dists/utopic/contrib/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/dists/utopic/non-free/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not found\n\nHow do I stop these messages from appearing?\n\nA: Your sources for apt-get are stored in /etc/apt/sources.list, so if you really just want to remove a source, you can edit that file and remove the appropriate lines. \nHowever, do you still have virtualbox installed? If you do, you will probably need to put the correct info into sources.list. From virtualbox's website:\nDebian-based Linux distributions\n\nAdd one of the following lines according to your distribution to your /etc/apt/sources.list:\n\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian saucy contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian raring contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian quantal contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian precise contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian lucid contrib non-free\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian wheezy contrib\ndeb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian squeeze contrib non-free\n\nSo perhaps try changing the virtualbox lines in /etc/apt/sources.list to one of those lines above (choose the lines which matches your version of ubuntu).\n", "Q: Run script on shell login for all users I have a script named \"als\" that parses the aliases in a user's .bashrc file that I'd like to run for any user logging in via SSH. \nThis should display similar to a Message of the day (MOTD) banner.

Again, I'd like this to run for all users on shell login\n\nA: You could save your script in /etc/profile.d/als.sh. According to Ubuntu EnvironmentVariables manual:\n\nFiles with the .sh extension in the /etc/profile.d directory get\n  executed whenever a bash login shell is entered (e.g. when logging in\n  from the console or over ssh), as well as by the DisplayManager when\n  the desktop session loads.\n\nYou should also modify relative path with absolute path:\n cat /home/$USER/.bashrc | egrep 'alias.+\\=' | tr -s [:space:] | sed 's_^ alias_alias_' | sed 's_alias__' | sort | sed 's_=_\\t\\t_' | sed 's_^ __'  \n\nAnd this should works for all users. \n", "Q: import thunderbird account from file Thanks for the help everyone. I'm going to rephrase this entry to highlight the solution in case anyone else searches and ends up here.\nI had to re-install all my data from a saved backup. I use thunderbird and wanted to keep my old saved emails. To create this backup I had copied the folder /home/[USERID]/ onto an external backup along with all its subfolders. To save emails, inside this folder is a subfolder .thunderbird/ , and inside that is another subfolder that has a name consisting of some random characters: let's call it [old_folder_name].default. So on my new system, I now had to take what was saved on the external hard drive (HD) in  /home/[USERID]/.thunderbird/[old_folder_name].default/ and import it to my local machine.\nFollowing advice I was given below, I launched thunderbird from scratch (after deleting the previous ~/.thunderbird folder to make sure I was starting clean) and then closed it again. That created a new folder inside ~/.thunderbird/ which I'll call [new_folder_name].default/ . I then copied the contents of [old_folder_name].default/ into [new_folder_name].default/ and relaunched thunderbird. \nNormally, this should work. The reason I was having problems is that the external HD I was using wasn't giving me adequate permissions to manage these files, so I had to go to [new_folder_name].default/ and use \n$ chmod -R 777 *\n\nwhich might actually be a bit too permissive (I'm not sure if this is a security liability), but I just wanted to get something working.  \nTo answer a question below: my external drive was using Ext4 formatting. To create the backup I had been doing this every once in a while:\n$ rsync -rv [directory to be backed up]  [directory to send to it]\n\nsending the data from my local HD to the external media to back it up, and then vice-versa to put it back onto my local HD. I had assumed that that would preserve the same permissions (I kept the same username, although I did change the name of my PC in my new OS installation).\nCan anyone suggest a way to rsync without running these sort of permission problems? (or, alternatively, another way to back things up where I can review the contents?)\nthanks again for your help.\n\nA: All you need is your so called 'profile' folder from your backup. This is a folder with the .default extension (the foldername itself will be some random numbers and letters ). It will be located in  ~/.thundebird .\nIn a clean install of mozilla thunderbird, you then need to copy that folder into the same directory on your newly installed Ubuntu machine. Then copy the name of the .default folder that was already there, delete that folder and give the foldername you copied to the folder from your backup. Restart thunderbird and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Install a list of packages and replace all errors I have a list of packages I would like to install on a fresh Ubuntu. Since those is a quite old list, I would like so see the outcome, If I would replace the suggestions automatically.\nSo all packages that are referenced to a newer other package shoud be auto-resolved and missing packages should be auto ignored.\nIs there such an option like apt-get install --fix-all\nThen I could install it with \nurl=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rubo77/bd9183fe2794467f482c/raw/5342531410a31513f827a2b8050e569e57870b66/gistfile1.txt\necho $(wget $url -qO -|xargs) > /tmp/pkglist\nsudo apt-get install $(cat /tmp/pkglist)\n\n\nA: You can use dpkg to install the list of packages.\nFirst, you need to set the list of selected packages.\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < filename\n\nwhere filename is the name of the file which contains the list of packages.\nThen, update and install.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nThis method only adds and upgrades packages, it will not remove packages that do not exist in the list.\n\nA: Use aptitude instead of apt-get.

I tried many different answers from other users but it never really solved it so maybe any of you can help me fix this :) My laptop is a Lenovo Y500 with a GT 650M graphic card and I am using ubuntu 14.04.1.\nMost stuff seems to be working correctly but the moment my laptop uses any dark colours the screens starts flickering really bad and it is nearly impossible to navigate through it. I uploaded a video so you can see it on a movie but it happens everywhere there are dark colours (even while booting till the moment I hit the desktop although sometimes it kicks in later instead of immidiatly). In the movie you also see shortly when the yellow light comes in the flickering stops. Here is the link: http://youtu.be/7wsctkwNylI\nI tried alot of different drivers but none so far work, most of them even made that my ubuntu could not start up anymore after the updates ubuntu would start booting and my laptop will just automatically turn off while booting. After that using alternatives like booting in the rootshell to remove the drivers wasnt possible either so i ended up reinstalling ubuntu everytime.\nI considered that my graphic card might be failing but the problems started immediately after the first installation of ubuntu.\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Seems Nouveau accelerated Open Source driver for nVidia cards is not working well for your device.

Please check connectivity and permissions, and report a bug if problems persist. \n\nSo How to get and set the publickey? or Do I have a mistake with bzr command?\nAnd what is launchpad-buildd?\n\nA: The publickey is your public ssh key. The error is because it is trying to connect to the bzr server on Launchpad, using the ssh method. By default, it tries to connect using the same username as your local account, and will try to negotiate the session, using your existing ssh key. If you don't have an account on Launchpad, or someone else has an account with the same username you use on your PC, it will fail to connect. It should only do this if you have told bzr about your Launchpad username. If you are running a script from a cron job or other unauthenticated session, then it will not have the ssh keyring unlocked, and thus will not be able to use your ssh identity to authenticate with the server, though bzr is configured to do so.\nIf you want to run something in a cron job or unauthenticated session, which checks out a branch from Launchpad, you can create another user on your computer to use for such tasks, which does not have bzr configured to log in to Launchpad as your user. Instead, it will use the anonymous download over HTTP when checking out branches.\n", "Q: Last command and execution time I'd like to get the last command used and its execution time. This will be used as part of an alias for notification.\n\nA: NOTE: I'm assuming bash as the shell.\nAdapting to other shells shouldn't be difficult.\nGetting the last command used is trivial: it's stored in the shell event designator !!, and can also be obtained using the shell builtins fc (fc -s) or history (with some string manuipluation: history 1 | awk '{$1=\"\"}1').\nGetting the time of execution, or the running time, however, is not, unless some action is taken before the command has executed. Once the command is run, nothing can be done - the horses have bolted.\nFor getting the time of execution, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable, which would make bash save the time of execution in the history, then use text processing to extract the time from the output of history. \n\n*Use a wrapper to save the execution time manually.\n\n\nFor getting the running time, again, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you had set HISTTIMEFORMAT before running the command, you could parse the output of history to get the execution time and then calculate the run time.\n\n*Use a wrapper to run the command with time: time some-command. Processing the output of time is a bit messy if you want to leave the output of the command untouched.\n\n*Use a wrapper to calculate runtime based on manually saved execution time.\n\n\n\nWith HISTTIMEFORMAT set\nIf you set the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable, then you need not use a wrapper. \nFirst, in your .bashrc, set HISTTIMEFORMAT. You can set it to anything, as long as it's not empty. If you don't want your history command to show the time, you could set it to a space (HISTTIMEFORMAT=\" \").\nNow, there's an alias present in the default .bashrc of Ubuntu:\n# Add an \"alert\" alias for long running commands.  Use like so:\n#   sleep 10; alert\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\n\nWe can adapt it for our purposes:\nalert_post () \n{ \n    RET=$?;\n    END=$(date '+%s');\n    LAST_COMM=\"$(HISTTIMEFORMAT='%s '; history 1)\";\n    START=$(awk '{print $2}' <<<\"$LAST_COMM\");\n    START_TIME=$(date -d\"@$START\" '+%T %D');\n    COMM=$(awk '{print $3}' <<<\"$LAST_COMM\");\n    notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $RET = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$COMM started at $START_TIME finished in $((END - START)) seconds.\";\n    return $RET\n}\nalias a=alert_post\n\nYou can use it thus:\n$ sleep 10; a\n\n\nWrapper function\nUsing a function or a script to wrap around the command:\nalert_wrapper () \n{ \n    START=$SECONDS;\n    START_TIME=$(date '+%T %D');\n    COMM=\"$1\";\n    \"$@\";\n    RET=$?;\n    END=$SECONDS;\n    notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $RET = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$COMM started at $START_TIME finished in $((END - START)) seconds.\"\n    return $RET\n}\nalias a=alertwrapper\n\nThen run your command prefixed with a:\n$ a sleep 10\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are many ways of getting the time, both execution and runtime. I used both the $SECONDS special variable and the date command. You could get by with only the date command. \n\n*I have used notify-usd, which should be available on standard Ubuntu. You could look at other ways of producing notifications.\n\n*I have saved the exit status of the command in $RET and returned it, so you should be able to rely on exit codes: do-something; a || echo \"Couldn't do something.\" or a do-something || echo \"Couldn't do something.\" will echo if do-something had a non-zero exit status.\n\n\nA: The last command is saved in the history. Bash has an fc command that gives you access to that information (from man bash):\nfc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]\nfc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]\n\n\nThe first form selects a range of commands from first to last from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them.  First  and  last may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).  If last is not specified it is set to the current command  for  listing  (so  that  ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to first otherwise.  If first is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.\nThe -n option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.  If the -l  option  is  given,  the commands  are  listed  on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If ename is not given, the value of the FCEDIT variable is used, and the value of EDITOR if FCEDIT is not set.  If neither variable is set,  vi  is  used.   When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.\nIn the second form, command is re-executed after each instance of pat is replaced by rep.  Command is intepreted the same as first above.  A useful alias to use with this is r=\"fc -s\"'', so that typingr cc'' runs the last command beginning with cc'' and typingr'' re-executes the last command.\nIf the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or first or last specify history lines out of range.  If the -e option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the  temporary  file  of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless cmd does not specify a valid history line, in which case fc returns failure.\n\nThere is also a command named history. The manual explains that in details. I'm not too sure which one would better fit your needs.\nFurther, to get the time, you may want to look into setting up the HISTTIMEFORMAT. However, I'm not too sure how you could access the amount of time spent by the process. Maybe the TIMEFORMAT should be used instead. Otherwise, the Unix way is to run the command with the time command. That will generate output of various time and resources used by the process while running.\nFrom the manual (man time):\n\ntime run the program COMMAND with any given arguments ARG....  When COMMAND finishes, time displays information about resources used by COMMAND (on the standard error output, by default).  If COMMAND exits with non-zero status, time displays a warning message and the exit status.\n\n", "Q: E: Syntax error /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptitude:4: Extra junk at end of file ubuntu 14.04 Update manager: “A problem occurred when checking for the updates\nthat is what appear when using terminal \n\nA: Each line in the 00aptitude file should end with a semicolon character.\nRun the command man apt.conf from the terminal and under the DESCRIPTION and SYNTAX headings it says: \n\napt.conf is the main configuration file for the APT suite of tools, all tools make use of the configuration file and a common command-line parser to provide a uniform environment.\n  ...\n  APT::Get::Assume-Yes \"true\";.

It took about 45 minutes each time it had to download packages (2 times).\nAfter the installation, I could not search on Firefox, although the little connection symbol on the top right was telling me that I was connected. After a little while, I was able to search on Google, but only for a minute.

In command line, how can I stop all services from my Ubuntu (Server in this particular case), except SSH?\nAnd how can I list all services to be sure all of them were stopped?\n\nA: I seriously doubt that your system will be still in a useful state after disabling everything but sshd. \nFor a status list of upstart services do: \nsudo service --status-all\n\nFor System V services:  \nsudo initctl list\n\nDisable anything that has a + or is listed as start/running with the appropriate commands. To state the blatantly obvious: if you do this via ssh \"service network stop\" or the like won't do you any good. \n\nA: What you are looking for is called single user mode.  It is a state where only the bare essential services required for the machine to run are running.  You enter it either by booting with an 's' argument given to the kernel, or you can switch to it using init s.  sshd is not normally considered an essential service though, so it would be stopped.  To fix this, you need to edit /etc/init/ssh.conf and add an 'S' to the list of runlevels it should start in and not be stopped in, so it looks like this:\nstart on runlevel [S12345]\nstop on runlevel [!S12345]\n\n", "Q: manually make drive bootable I have extracted my iso to my pendrive instead of letting a boot utility software do it.

I just bought the 11,6 inches Acer Aspire ES1-111M-C56A (Intel Celeron N2840, 2,1GHz, 2GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, Intel HD Graphics, Win 8.1 with Bing) and I'm facing different problems when trying to install Ubuntu. The Laptop comes with Windows 8.1 and I want to remove it completely.\nI disabled the secure boot and changed the boot mode from UEFI to Legacy. If I boot with the UEFI boot mode I go directly to the Windows login page.\nThe Laptop has a 32GB harddisk and aprox. 14 or 16GB is used by the windows system. The partitions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*100MB (EFI),\n\n*19GB NTFS (for the user)\n\n*10GB (recovery?)\n\n\nIf I boot with a Debian LiveUSB (gnome and xfce) or netinst (text mode) the installer recognizes no hard disks (except the USB device I'm already using). If I boot with Xubuntu, the pointer keeps loading infinitely after I choose the language (i.e the first installation window).\nWith the standard Ubuntu I get the following message right after choosing \"Try Ubuntu\" from the text mode menu screen:\nKernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (2,0)\n\n...followed by other messages like:\nCall Trace:\n[ < fffffff...\n\n(If they are relevant, I will write them completely.)\nBoth architectures (of all the mentioned distros) were tested: 32 und 64 bits. The laptop has no CD drive, the WiFi wont work out of the box (it's the Broadcom BCM43142) and at the moment I can't setup an Ethernet connection.\nI appreciate any comments/suggestions.\n\nA: I've also bought this little notebook. I faced almost the same problems as you when i booted with 'legacy' mode. I fixed that issue with enabled 'uefi' mode in bios settings. On ubuntu you can either enable or disable the secure boot option to get it booting. (While booting ubuntu enables 'secure boot' anyways)\nFormat an usb stick with FAT32 and copy ubuntu 14.10 x64! (For 'uefi' you need to have th e 64bit version of ubuntu. The 32bit wont boot as uefi only supports 64bit os)\nFor copying i prefer you to use 'unetbootin'. It's an easy tool to copy Linux based OS's to usb sticks. \nAfter copying boot from usb. Check in bios first if you have enabled the F12 bootmenu selection. So you have to press the F12 key to get list of 'uefi boot devices'. Choose your usb stick and boot from it.\nIt will boot with uefi boot mode. With that mode its possible to install the os to the emmc. In legacy mode the emmc doesn't(i don't know why). You can only install Linux with uefi mode.\nI tried that method with ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 only. It may works with others too.\nAnd about your wifi problem. Check if its a hardware issue or re-install the drivers. If its a hardware bug you have to send it back to acer to get a new 'fixed' one.\n", "Q: How to import VNStat data from 32 bit ubuntu to 64 bit? I want to backup vnstst log and import it into new ubuntu system. Currently Iam in 32 bit ubuntu 14.04 and planning for 64 bit 14.04LTS. \nI have read this \"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2053507\" . Where they said that \"databases from 32 bit machines and 64 bit machines apparently are not compatible. I had noticed a slight size difference between them\". \nHow to make them compatible with 64 bit os?\n\nA: There are two options available for getting a vnStat database created in a 32bit system to be readable in a 64bit system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the (somewhat experimental) database convertion tool: http://humdi.net/vnstat/dbconvert.c\n\n*Export the database using the --dumpdb parameter to a file in the 32bit system, then in the 64bit system, using vnStat 1.12 or later, use the --importdb parameter to import the database from the previously created text file\n\n\nBoth should give the same end result. Option 1 is simpler and isn't limited on having also the 32bit system available as long as the database files are still available. Option 2 allows you to also modify the database data if needed but will require more work since 14.04 doesn't include vnStat version 1.12.\n", "Q: Shell Script to check for subdirectory A.

Piping the whole output to cut means we have to run cut only once.

I would like to get an auto-updating version of Firefox Developer Edition rather than a once-off installation. From comments on the announcement and this Mozilla ticket it appears that Firefox Developer Edition is a rebranding of Aurora (a stable pre-release channel).\nIn that case, can I just install the Firefox Aurora PPA which is maintained by the Ubuntu Mozilla Daily Build Team?\n\nA: The OMG! Ubuntu! post covering the announcement notes that the version released is Aurora 35.0a2 which matches the version in the PPA, so it looks like this is the way to do it :)\nNote that this method will replace your current Firefox installation.

I have different groups like: admin/managers/executive/developers/users/clients.\nNow I have around 10 different application in PHP/Java on running on live-server. How can I configure that some application can only accessible or edit by specific to group's user. For Example. If the user A is from the group Admin->Is allow some pages/functions to access and can edit as well while client or user have limited access (only can view some pages) while Developer can edit the information too.\nMaybe: I know, but a silly question. Which group to authenticate (login process) at application level is set at application server level (Apache in PHP)? \n\nA: This question is quite old but I'll give in my experience.\nUse LDAP for authentication, not for authorization.  This means that the PHP app should authenticate a user against the LDAP server and grant authorization based on internal policies (validated against groups the user may be in, for instance).  Most web frameworks out there should provide a wide variety of LDAP authentication libraries.  This way, authorization is decentralized and simplified in medium/long term.\nIn case of application directly run on a client machine, note that LDAP will preserve posix groups and the following question could help: How can I restrict program access to other users?\n", "Q: Sharing folder with VM through libvirt, 9p, permission denied An Ubuntu Server 14.04 Host hosts an Ubuntu Server 14.04 guest via libvirt/qemu-kvm.\nThe system runs fine, but - as guest - I have issues writing to a shared folder (<filesystem>) that drive me nuts.

(This way is intended to just get 9p to work, both ways, without security hassles. For more security, you will need a different method or settings)\nHOST (order is unimportant)\n\n\n*\n\n*I added my host user to the following group: <kvm> (I am also a member of <libvirtd>). This step may be unnecessary because:\n\n*in the file /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf you can change the user and group with which all of your VMs authenticate and execute.\n(this is a powerful little change, and the repercussions need to be mapped out if you are trying to accomplish this on something like a production server)\nuser = \"billy\"    #### No, my name isn't billy, but it's cute. \n                  #### Alternatively you can declare your <uid>, like\n                  ## user = \"+1000\" ####        << That's what I did.\n                  #### (They tell you everything you need to know about\n                  #### this stuff inside /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf)\ngroup = \"billy\"\ndynamic_ownership = 1\n\n(What the above change does is tells the virtual machine host to convert all libvirt cross-VM-requests for any guest VMs you are running to the <user> that you set; including guest-VM <root>. *Note again that it is a system-wide setting with regard to libvirt and by extension qemu if libvirt is your sole qemu interface.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup you host as found in this excellent official document https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/9p_virtio\n(by the way, \"Squash\" references a 9p security model. It means \"none\" and is the most permissive setting for this context)\nGUEST\n\n\n*\n\n*Inside the guest VM, mount the 9p share using <root> privileges, also found at the bottom of the document https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/9p_virtio\n(I also added one option as explained in the document below)  My mount command is:\nmount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,access=any,version=9p2000.L /hostshare /tmp/host_files\n\nNore that if you don't have permission to write to the share or have limited permission after you have set this up, the excellent suggestion by @randomocean 's answer should help. That is, have <root> create a folder under the share, and set chmod 777 to it.\n-Even More Info: https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup\n\nA: I know, that this is an old thread, but I just came across a similar problem and found a solution that works at least in parts.\nI also changed the user and group values in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf to root, like you did.\nBut I also changed the dynamic_ownership setting, because the description sounded promising:\n\n# Whether libvirt should dynamically change file ownership\n  # to match the configured user/group above.

The question does not specify Minikube, but it does not matter since it is a VM run by QEMU/KVM. The instructions below should apply to any QEMU/KVM VM. I could not find specific instructions on how to mount host directories into KVM VMs. I searched a lot and it was quite tiresome. I will explain what I did to handle permission errors as well as symlink errors or \"Unknown error 526\" errors. I am going to mention briefly why it was necessary to have this setup, just to include a few keywords that someone having the same issues might use when searching for a solution.\nProblem\nI was running Minikube via VirtualBox. VirtualBox can mount /Users on MacOS, or /home on Linux, into the VM, and you do not need to tackle mounting problems as much as you have to do with KVM. I needed to develop an Android application whose backend should run on Kubernetes. To test the Android application, I need to run virtual devices, which are run via KVM on Linux. One cannot run a VM on VirtualBox and a VM on KVM at the same time, because only one of them can use the CPU's virtualization technology at a time. It would be quite an inconvenience to shut down Minikube when I would need to check something in the Android application or vice versa. Since it is possible to run many VMs on KVM at the same time, I decided to run Minikube on KVM just for the sake of running both Minikube and Android virtual devices at the same time. It is also possible to run many VMs at the same time with VirtualBox, but the default Android virtual devices are not run on VirtualBox. It looks like Genymotion uses VirtualBox but it is a paid solution.\nGoal\nMy goal was to mount the directory that contains my application files just like VirtualBox mounts. Minikube can mount directories from host via minikube mount command, but, at the time of writing, it is not reliable for some reason. It gave me Unknown error 526 while I tried to access the files. It is also very slow.\n@Alexander's answer helped me solve the issue, in fact. But, it was not quite enough, since I did not want to run the VMs as root. When they are run as root, the files and/or directories created inside the VMs have root:root permission in the host, which I do not want.\nSolution\nDefining the user that runs VMs\nFirst of all, I edited /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf file (on the host) to change the user who runs the VM processes as my user, which is ubuntu, and to disable dynamic_ownership:\nuser = \"ubuntu\"\ngroup = \"ubuntu\"\ndynamic_ownership = 0\n\nAfter making the change above, I restarted my host machine, since I do not know how to apply the changes otherwise. Without a restart, the VMs kept being run as the previous user, which was libvirt-qemu. To ensure the change has been applied, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*On your host machine, run ps aux | grep kvm\n\n*Check the user that runs the VM processes. You should see ubuntu in this case.\n\nDefining the mount volume\nNext, add a Filesystem hardware in Virtual Machine Manager:\n\n*\n\n*On the host, open Virtual Machine Manager by running virt-manager\n\n*Double click on the VM and select View > Details\n\n*In the Details window, click Add Hardware.\n\n*Select Filesystem and configure it like so:\n\nType: mount (only option)\nDriver: Path\nMode: Squash\nWrite Policy: Immediate\nSource Path: <absolute path to the directory you want to mount into the VM>\nTarget Path: hosthome # Or any other keyword or path that will be used to define the mount so that we can reference it when mounting it in the VM\n\n# Do not check \"Export filesystem as readonly mount\"\n\n\n\n*Click Apply. If the VM was running, the changes will be applied at the next boot.\n\nSquash mode is important, because it can handle symbolic links. The other modes gave me too many levels of symbolic links errors. Passthrough mode solved the issues that Mapped mode gave, but it was not enough. Squash mode is the mode that did not give me any errors.\nSolving permission issues that might occur when running the VM\nNow, start (or restart if it was running) the VM. If you get permission errors while starting the VM, then you need to make sure that the files used to run the VM belong to the user you defined in qemu.conf file. In my case, I changed the following files' permissions on the host by examining the error messages:\nchown ubuntu:kvm ~/.minikube/machines/minikube/boot2docker.iso # Previously belonged to \"libvirt-qemu\" user\nchown ubuntu:root ~/.minikube/machines/minikube/minikube.rawdisk # Previously belonged to \"root\" user\n\nMounting the volume to the VM\nNext, the only thing left to do is to mount the volume into the VM. Get into the VM, in my case via minikube ssh, and then mount the volume:\n# First, create the directory to which the the volume will be mounted. This might not be necessary in your case.\nsudo mkdir -p /hosthome/ubuntu/Projects\n\n# Then, mount the volume\nsudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,cache=none,msize=262144,rw hosthome /hosthome/ubuntu/Projects\n\n\n*\n\n*cache=none: This is for improved performance. You can change this to another value depending on your case. The values are explained here.\n\n*msize=262144: This is for improved performance as well. This defines \"the number of bytes to use for 9p packet payload\", as explained here. This is the default value used by minikube mount.\n\n*rw: \"Mount the filesystem read-write\", as explained in man mount. This is an option of mount command.\n\nThat's it. You should be able to read and write files/directories from within the VM without any issues. If /etc/fstab file inside the VM can be modified, the mounting logic can be added into the file so that the volume is mounted automatically after the VM starts. Unfortunately, this is not possible for Minikube (See Disadvantages section).\nWhat I gained with this setup\nThe problems this setup solved for me are:\n\n*\n\n*minikube mount was slow and unreliable, as it is explained in the documentation. The documentation says that 9p mounts are unreliable, but this setup is more reliable than minikube mount.\n\n*The files/directories created by Docker containers inside the mounted directory have ubuntu:ubuntu ownership on the host. So, I can access them from within the IDE and change them as I please. Previously, they had root:root ownership, which my user on the host did not have.\n\n*I no longer get Unknown error 526 which I got with minikube mount\n\n*The performance is higher than minikube mount\n\n*I can run virtual Android devices with hardware acceleration as well as a Kubernetes cluster at the same time such that the development is much more convenient. Actually, the development is \"possible\" now.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n*\n\n*For Minikube, the volume should be mounted manually each time minikube is started. This is because Minikube does not persist the changes made to /etc/fstab file. As a convenience workaround, a shell script that contains the mount command can be created inside /data directory, which survives through VM restarts, and it can be executed from within the VM, after the VM is started.\n\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*The answers to this question\n\n*man mount\n\n*Sharing directories with virtual machines and libvirt\n\n*v9fs: Plan 9 Resource Sharing for Linux\n\nA: I had this problem too, created a folder named /home/user/shared on the host and then used virt-manager to add the folder and mounted it as a 9p virtio on the qemu VM.  \nI checked out the settings in /etc/apparmor.d/libvirt and it has entries for the new /home/user/shared, and I noticed it only had 'r' permission for /home/user/shared but it has rw for all files in /home/user/shared/.  I tried adding a w for write permissions, but that didn't seem to get saved so I went into the host /home/user/shared and created a sub directory and did a chmod 777 on that sub directory.  That worked and the guest VM was able to write to the su director any create and edit files.\ntldr: create a subdirectory in the shared folder with 777 permissions and see if you can write to that.\n\nA: For me, adjusting a proper ACL mask on the host machine did it:\nsudo setfacl -Rm u:libvirt-qemu:rwx /data\n\n(Ubuntu Server 20.04 host, Debian 10 guest, and passthrough access mode)\n", "Q: How can I prevent my NVidia Jetson TK1 from automatically booting the GUI (black screen after a software-update crash), and bring it back to normal?

Can I search the apt-get repository for all packages containing the word \"cuda\"?  It seems odd that NVidia would mess up such a basic instruction, and I'm pretty sure people are using this machine explicitly for cuda applications. \nThe only difference from their instructions was when I downloaded cuda-repo-l4t-r19.2_6.0-42_armhf.deb, I allowed the Ubuntu Software Center to do the install instead of using sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-l4t-r19.2_6.0-42_armhf.deb.  I don't think that should be an issue though.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10 you can install nvidia-331, NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and the NVIDIA CUDA 5.5 Runtime library directly from the default Ubuntu repositories. libcudart5.5 is the package name of the NVIDIA CUDA runtime library. libcudart5.5 requires the nvidia-331 or more recent graphics driver. There is also an NVIDIA CUDA toolkit package (nvidia-cuda-toolkit) in the default Ubuntu repositories for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10, and like libcudart5.5 it is also version 5.5. \nIn Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10 libcudart5.5 has been upgraded to libcudart6.5, and the nvidia-cuda-toolkit like libcudart6.5 is also version 6.5.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 libcudart has been upgraded to libcudart7.5, and the nvidia-cuda-toolkit like libcudart7.5 is also version 7.5.\n\nA: I would say that the instructions are outdated. They mention CUDA 6.0 and Ubuntu 12.04, whereas the nVidia downloads page mention CUDA 6.5 and Ubuntu 14.04. There's no evidence that the wiki page you link to is written by nVidia, so it's not a surprise to me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS installation failed Yesterday I downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS from the official site(ubuntu.com).Then I made a bootable usb with startup disk creator.But when I am trying to install , gives me this error!! why ? and how to solve this issue ? \nI ran this now what ?\n\nA: *\n\n*Check that the download was OK with md5sum in a terminal window\n\n\nCode:\nmd5sum filename.iso\nUse the real filename of the downloaded iso file instead of 'filename' in the command.

I've seen a few posts on checking for rootkits but haven't been able to find any information on how they get onto a linux system. In particular if you exploit a bug in a php web site (yes I'm talking about drupageddon here) is it possible to install a rootkit even though you can only run as the web-server (www-data) and not as root. The very little information I've found about how these are installed suggests you have to be root to install them (see here).\n\nA: If it was me I would persue the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a user to download and install a piece of software (#1). Have that software install the intended software. Hide a binairy blob inside that application lets you download software (ie. a tool you can use to ftp, wget etc). \n\n*Prompt for the admin account (#2) and use that to use an ftp, wget instance to download and install the rootkit.\n\n\nRegarding #1: a user should never download random software when using Linux; use the appropriate channels (Ubuntu Software Center) to install software. If it is software that needs to be downloaded outside the appropriate channels make sure the source of the download can be trusted. Think latest versions of Apache software or MySQL. Do not go around downloading random software without checking out different social media about the integrity of that application. Microsoft never centralized software; it resulted in lots of people dabbling with software so their user base is hugh, but that also made it easy to get into computers and start gathering data they can sell. \nRegarding #2: fatal user flaw. Never ever ever ever type in your admin password unless you know why it is asked. \n\nA: Yes, in general root permission are required to install a rootkit.\nMany of the rootkits contain a module that is loaded into the kernel, other just overwrite tool typically used by root. In a properly set and perfect system there would be no way to install the root kit without root privileges, but...\n...there might be problems with the system configuration making the system unsafe.\n...there might be security bugs that allow a privilege elevation\n...there might be ways to trick a user with root permissions to run something evil.\nThe ways are as unlimited as the imagination of the intruder.\n", "Q: Measure bandwidth used by a single program execution I'd like to measure the bandwidth consumed by a single program launch (for processes launched from cron, in order to get an idea of how much BW they are using). I know of nethogs and the many other commands that measure bandwidth per device/port.\nIdeally, it would be something like trickle, which is prepended to the command and on finalization reports the data used. My research comes up with no results.\nMy only alternative idea is to use ifconfig to get the bytes transmitted before launch and after finalization, but this is obviously very rough. Ideas for anything better?\nI guess trickle could be used as the easier starting point for such a program, if one had enough time for coding it...\n\nA: nethogs does this: http://nethogs.sourceforge.net/, install it using the software center.\nI believe that sysdig could be used, too but I don't have the syntax at hand.\n\nA: One way I can think for transmitted data is to use iptables, while running the program under some unique matchable condition, such as a separate group.\nFirst, pick a group which you belong to and under which no processes are running:\n$ for i in $(groups); do echo $i $(pgrep -c -G $i); done | awk '$2 == 0'\ncdrom 0\nsudo 0\nplugdev 0\nlpadmin 0\nsambashare 0\ndebian-tor 0\nlibvirtd 0\n\nI'll pick debian-tor. Now add an iptables rule which will match traffic originating from process in this group. This will need root access, so add sudo to all the iptables commands:\niptables -N STATS  # Create a new chain\niptables -A STATS -p tcp -j RETURN # And let it do nothing\niptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --gid-owner debian-tor -j STATS\n\nStart your application:\nsg debian-tor 'ssh a.friendly.system \"cat - >/dev/null\" </dev/zero'\n\nCheck the stats:\n$ iptables -vL  STATS\nChain STATS (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n 148K  393M ACCEPT     tcp  --  any    any     anywhere             anywhere     \n\nThis won't work for received data. :(\n\nThe other way could be to use /proc/$PID/netstat, if you can convince your application to stay alive long enough:\n$ awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {($i~/(In|Out)Octets/) && a[i] = 1}; z=\"\"; for (i=1; i<=NF; i++){(a[i] == 1) && z = z \" \" $i}; if (z) {print z}}' /proc/12307/net/netstat \n InOctets OutOctets\n 254543569761 2144044764834\n\n(All that awk code is to look for the InOctects and OutOctects columns in the netstat file.)\nUnfortunately, /proc/$PID/net is simply /proc/net, so that the information is common to all processes. Reading netstat doesn't give any information about the particular process.\n", "Q: SIGBUS error with JRE when using eclipse I encountered a SIGBUS error when starting up eclipse.

So I have checked that it works also to copy big files.\nTo be used for real copying, I think you should increase the time to copy (from 25 seconds), and you should also increase the time to sleep (from 5 seconds). Use the time intervals that are best for your particular task.\nComments about the command line options and parameters\nThe command timeout stops the execution of the command it controls even when in the middle of copying a file.\n   --foreground\n\n          when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,\n\n          allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals; in  this\n          mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out\n\nThe command rsync is a powerful copying command. See man rsync to get a complete description of the possible options.\n   --info=FLAGS\n          This option lets you have fine-grained control over the informa‐\n          tion output you want to see.  An individual  flag  name  may  be\n          followed  by a level number, with 0 meaning to silence that out‐\n          put, 1 being  the  default  output  level,  and  higher  numbers\n          increasing  the  output  of  that  flag  (for those that support\n          higher levels).  Use --info=help to see all the  available  flag\n          names,  what they output, and what flag names are added for each\n          increase in the verbose level.  Some examples:\n\n              rsync -a --info=progress2 src/ dest/\n              rsync -avv --info=stats2,misc1,flist0 src/ dest/\n\n   --partial\n          By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file  if\n          the  transfer  is  interrupted. In some circumstances it is more\n          desirable to keep partially transferred files. Using the  --par‐\n          tial  option  tells  rsync to keep the partial file which should\n          make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.\n\nYou may or may not like the --hard-links option,\n   -H, --hard-links\n          This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the source and\n          link together the corresponding files on the destination.  With‐\n          out  this option, hard-linked files in the source are treated as\n          though they were separate files.\n\n   -a, --archive\n          This  is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you\n          want recursion and want to preserve almost everything  (with  -H\n          being  a  notable  omission).   The  only exception to the above\n          equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case  -r\n          is not implied.\n\n          Note that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because finding multi‐\n          ply-linked files is expensive.  You must separately specify -H.\n\nFinally, read this explanation about the parameters (source and target),\n          rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp\n\n   This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on\n   the  machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine.\n   The files are transferred in \"archive\" mode, which  ensures  that  sym‐\n   bolic  links,  devices,  attributes,  permissions, ownerships, etc. are\n   preserved in the transfer.  Additionally, compression will be  used  to\n   reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.\n\n          rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp\n\n   A  trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating\n   an additional directory level at the destination.  You can think  of  a\n   trailing / on a source as meaning \"copy the contents of this directory\"\n   as opposed to \"copy the directory by  name\",  but  in  both  cases  the\n   attributes  of the containing directory are transferred to the contain‐\n   ing directory on the destination.  In other words, each of the  follow‐\n   ing  commands copies the files in the same way, including their setting\n   of the attributes of /dest/foo:\n\n          rsync -av /src/foo /dest\n          rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo\n\n", "Q: How full is the Ubuntu ARM port (repositories)? I'm thinking about buying a new laptop (Chromebook). \nNow I previously had a Chromebook and installed Crouton and Chrubuntu on it. \nChrubuntu was bad, but I was quite happy with Crouton, battery lifetime was excellent, and speed more than adequate, PostGreSQL, mono, monodevelop and nginx firefox and chrome/chromium  all ran on it, and it used less space than Chrubuntu did.\nUnfortunately the laptop drove away in a train, but without me :(     ;)\nSince it looks like I don't get it back, I wanna buy a new one. \nFrom the previous experience, this time I want a slightly bigger hard drive than last time, that is 32GB, and 4GB RAM also seem better than 2GB RAM, max-browser-tab-count-wise. \nNow, for what I want, I have the choice between \nAcer Chromebook CB5-311-T5G2\n\nand\nHP Chromebook 14-q030ez\n\nNow they both cost CHF 400 (399 actually, around 400-450$), but HP uses a Intel Celeron processor, while Acer uses a NVIDIA Tegra K1 ARM processor. \nThe difference this makes, is the HP chromebook has a battery lifetime of appx. 6 hours, while the Acer Chromebook has a battery lifetime of about 13 hours. \nNow of course I'm going for the 13 hours; \nI've read that Crouton + Ubuntu on it should work (don't necessarely like the should, but I will risk that).\nBut I don't know how much of the Ubuntu repositories are available/ported on ARM Ubuntu. \nAnybody using ARM Ubuntu that knows about that ? \nCan I assume I find MySQL, PostgreSQL, PHP, mono, MonoDevelop, nginx, Geany, zip/rar and Chromium there ? \nWhat about (Oracle) Java ? \n\nA: OK, answering my own question.\nSince I now have an Acer Chromebook CB5-311-T5G2 with ARM processor, I can now answer this question.\nThe repositories are quite extensive.\nMySQL, PostgreSQL, PHP, mono, MonoDevelop, nginx, Geany, zip/rar, Chromium and ubuntu-restricted-extras are all no problem. MySQL-workbench and pgadmin3 seem to work better than on my old x86 Chromebook.\nFirefox seems to be a bit unstable on ARM (crashes when displaying certain download boxes) - but then again, Firefox being unstable is old news.\nOracle Java can also be installed normally via webupd8.\nI ran ElasticSearch, and it worked like a charm - out of the box with the .deb on it's site (thanks to only using Bash-Scripts & Java). \nAlso, MonoDevelop and mono are there, and seem to work. \n\nThere is no filename on the open sourcecode tabs, but that's about it (not sure if that's an issue with 3D/GL acceleration). (was a mono issue - is fixed)\nASP.NET MVC 3&4 work as well. \nThe only software-troubles I've come across is that Adobe Acrobat Reader is not available for ARM Linux, and Microsoft Skype does not offer a .deb compiled for ARM (suckers) ...\nBut it looks like one should be able to get Skype running on ARM with a \"tiny little bit\" (warning sarcasm) of extra-work. I'll go with Google-Hangouts/ GoogleTalk/ WebRTC instead. Probably one could get Viber to work more easily. \nMore troublesome seems to be the 3D accelerations.  \nNow, since I don't want to run Quake3/OpenArena on that laptop, I would have thought that this is no problem at all. \nBut apparently, the abomination that is infamous as Gnome3, as well as KDE and Enlightenment all require 3D acceleration, and what's more important: this requirement can't be disabled anywhere (which is why they are abominations)... \nSo it turns out that the primary issue is hardware acceleration.\nOn x86 platforms, the graphics card hardware can be shared between the VTs, so Unity works fine in x86-Crouton.\nOn ARM, however, we can only have one X11 server touching the hardware at once. This isn't an issue on Chrubuntu (Ubuntu dual boot), since it uses only one X11-server. \nHowever, in crouton, ChromeOS owns the sole X11 server anyway.  \nSo it's necessary to instead create a nested X11 server using Xephyr (crouton does all that for you automagically).\nWhich works great, and lets you toggle between the two seamlessly. \nBut you don't get video acceleration, so OpenGL/GL is emulated by software. \nAnd Unity and Compiz do not like this at all.\nIn this issue thread about that matter it's being said that you can run unity-2d instead.\nWell, don't try, it doesn't work, at least not for me.\nSo, you'll have to stick with XFCE. \nMind yourself, XFCE is not that bad anymore like it was when I first installed it 5 years ago. \nIt looks like the XFCE-programmers have found it in their heart to allow you to create launchers/shortcuts nowadays :)\n\nActually, it looks quite bad after the default install. \nThe keyboard-layout is wrong, and the dock bar and the top task-bar combination is particularly bad, as having the task bar on top takes some getting used to, and the combination of two panels, the dock using huge icons, takes up far too much screen real-estate to be of any use. \nFortunately, you can move the dock vertically to the left, like the unity bar, and put it on autohide and make the icons smaller. \nPlus you can move to top bar to the bottom, and remove the \"Applications menu\" title, which leaves you with something almost windows-like.\nThen you can just install gnome-terminal and proclaim it default-terminal, which gets rid of the ugly under-usable xfce-terminal. \n \nAs you can see, one can even customize the date-time format display, and add a keyboard-swicher and show-desktop applet to the panel.\nI'd say with a bit of graphical & icon beautification, XFCE4 would have the potential to beat gnome3 in usability. \n", "Q: Open directory from ls result I have a problem, I would like to pipe ls and cd together. I create shell pipe like:\ncesta = ls -lat | awk 'NR==2 {print $8\"/\"}'\ncd $cesta\n\nBut it doesn't work. Could you help me. And I didn't receive any error.\nFilip\n\nA: There are a few issues with what you're attempting. First of all, to set a variable's value, you can't have spaces around the =. Then, in order to capture the output of a command you need either backtics, or preferably $(). \nFinally, and most importantly, you should not parse ls, it is very hard to do well and extremely prone to errors. Your approach will break if your directory name contains a space for example. In the examples below, what is the 8th field?\n $ ls -l\n total 0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 0 Nov 11 14:59 file1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 0 Nov 11  2013 file2\n-rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 0 Nov 11 15:00 file 2\n                                    -----\n                                      |--------> 8th field      \n\nThe file/directory name might be the 9th field, or it might be the 9th and 10th fields, or even more. Plus, the date format can change between locales. Basically, using ls for this is a horrible idea. Instead, use stat and sort by time:\n$ cesta=$(stat --printf \"%X\\t%n\\n\" * | sort -nk1,1 | cut -f 2- | awk 'NR==2')\n$ cd \"$cesta\"\n\n\nA: What's the output of your command?\nls -lat | awk 'NR==2 {print $8\"/\"}'\n\nIn my case I had the hour of when the directory was created.\nUsing command substitution it worked for me:\n$ ABCD=`ls -lat | awk 'NR==2 {print $9\"/\"}'`\n$ cd $ABCD\n$ pwd\n$ /home/myuser_name/.gconfd\n\nCheers,\nHugo.\n", "Q: How to implement in upstart that a service is preventive restarted every x hours? I have a component --- started with upstart --- with a bug. The bug causes the application to freeze and unfortunately, it does not crush.\nAs a temporary walk-around, I want to force the service to restart every x hours, before the bug freezes the application. Is it possible with the upstart?\nI could implement a cron job for it but I would prefer to keep it in upstart to have all start logic in one place.\n\nA: I would expect you to do this with a \"reload\" or \"restart\" option from -outside- the script. See mysql and apache as an example: \"service apache restart\".\nAlter your upstart script so it has a \"restart\" feature and then add that as a command to \"/etc/crontab\".\nAnd yes, I understand this is not your intended answer but I also expect that the upstart script does NOT restart itself if it freezes and there is no crash. An \"oncrash\" can trigger a restarte but an \"onfreeze\" is probably not detectable.  \n\nSee chapter 16 Daemon behaviour for some tips on this.\n", "Q: Youtube causing black screen in chrome?

I'm sure this is a vague description, but I'm so satisfied with 12.04 that the upgrade seems unnecessary to me.\nOn the other hand, Lubuntu 14.04 works perfectly, but it is not my flavor of Ubuntu, so I want to know how much of a risk will be using an unsupported version in the future. Is it really comparable to Windows XP? Thanks.\nRoberto\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) version, which means that it is going to be supported for 5 years after the initial release based on Ubuntu policies. So, you should expect to be fine until some time in 2017. After that, indeed, you will be better off upgrading to another LTS release (14.04 is the current LTS, the next one should be 16.04).\n\nA: Yes and No, I will explain.\nUnsupported versions don't receive updates that could be necessary to work safely. Recently the bash was updated on all Ubuntu 14.4 and 14.10, the outdated bash have vulnerability problems that were solved with upgrade. However you can continue using unsupported version, as long you be aware what you need to maintain your system safe and working well.\n\nA: I short you wont get any security update for all system software. for example, bash shell(default shell in your terminal), Firefox, Rhythmbox etc. will not get update.\nOther software which you installed manually along with PPA will get updates.\nNOTE: its dangerous to use outdated software. Recently, bash had a vulnerability called shellshock, which did not got update for old Ubuntu versions. You may get hacked.

For example, the letter Z might not be mapped to the exact key (the one with the Z written on it). I don't know how the Persian layout is, but perhaps you could try finding which key corresponds to Z (if it's not the Z key) and try Ctrl+that key to see if it works as Redo. Then you'll have to check this for each shortcut you use.

I think it also says: \"Assuming drive cache: write through\". It's a new Intel SSD on which I've freshly installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 64bit.\n\nA: It looks like that there's no caching mechanism for your drive, it's disabled or maybe not recognized for some reason - so the system will write directly to the drive.\n", "Q: Looking for Ubuntu minimal VM I'm searching for an Ubuntu virtual image based off 14.04/14.10 Server edition minmal install which can work on Virtualbox.\nThanks in anticipation.\n\nA: You might want to check out http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/server/trusty/current/\nVagrant pulls some of its images from that site and runs them with VirtualBox by default. \nhttp://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/\n\nA: You can also spin your own minimal/customized image using vmbuilder.

Say I want to uninstall the Dash item \"Ubuntu Software Center\".\nTo uninstall it via CLI, I have to know what the .deb package is called. So I apt-cache search ubuntu-software-center but the only thing that shows up is lubuntu-software-center.\nI open Synaptic GUI program and search ubuntu-software-center and the first listing is what I want, called \"software-center.\"\nHow can I get \"software-center\" to show up in the output of a apt-cache search command? \n\nA: apt-cache search doesn't use a fancy full text search engine like Synaptic does, but simply prints all packages where your search words occur in the package name or description.\nAs neither the package name nor the description of software-center contains the word ubuntu-software-center a search using apt-cache will never find it that way.\nHowever you can use multiple search words with apt-cache search and it will show you  only the packages that contain all of them. So you can use e.g.\napt-cache search ubuntu software center\n\nwhich gets you a short list a packages including software-center.\nBTW, the apt-cache actually interprets the search words as regular expressions.\n\nA: From apt-get documentation, apt-cache search <search_term> will find packages that include <search_term>. \nSo if you want to get \"software-center\" to show up in the output of a apt-cache search command, you should try apt-cache search software-center.\nAnother related command can be dpkg -l *<search_term>* which will find packages whose names contain <search_term>. Similar to apt-cache search, but also shows whether a package is installed on your system by marking it with ii (installed) and un (not installed)\napt-cache search is a very rudimentary tool, basically implementing grep on package's descriptions. It often returns too many results or none at all when you include too many keywords.\naxi-cache search <search_term>, on the other hand, provides better results, sorted by relevancy. It uses the Xapian search engine and is part of the apt-xapian-index package which indexes all package information. It knows about tags and returns results in a matter of milliseconds. \n", "Q: \"browse\" button disabled in \"windows printer via samba\" for printer shares I have done a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10 and SMB printing seems to be missing.\nThere was no SAMBA option for adding a network printer, after Googling, I installed  libsmbclient, smbclient and python-smbc which seemed to give the functionality back.\nNow, the browse button next to where you paste the printer server is disabled (greyed out), you can see this in my picture below.  From more Googling, this seems to be an issue with python-smbc or its detection by system-config-printer-common.\nThe \"verify\" button also stays greyed and disabled after clicking the \"set authentication details now\" radio button and entering the username and password.  Though it never used to actually verify anything and it would actually stuff up my credentials, I had to just click forward after selecting my printer and entering the correct password etc without verifying it.\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=611303\nI have added my experience at the bottom of this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/print-manager/+bug/1181078\n\nPreviously, the SAMBA printer feature would be there by default (from memory) without me installing it.  I could just add a SAMBA printer on my university network on my laptop by clicking \"add printer\" button, clicking the arrow for network, clicking \"windows printer via samba\", pasting in the server name, clicking browse next to it and selecting the printer I want.\nI would have to manually select its brand and then the Ricoh model number etc and it would work.\nI would have to edit the PPD file to add my own usercode as that is how they track how many pages we print.\nPython-smbc seems to give the browse functionality to log into the server address pasted and then for the list of printers to appear.\nUsing the nautilus file browser, I can log in and browse to that same printer server and see the print$ folder so I assume its just something to activate the browse button.\n\nA: I had this same problem on an Arch Linux system.\nI solved it by installing python-pysmbc package.\nThe equivalent package for ubuntu is \"python-smbc\". So just do:\nsudo apt-get install python-smbc python3-smbc   \n\nAnd you should be good to go. Restart \"system-config-printer\" to make sure the new dependencies get used.\nCheers!\n\nA: I too installed python3-smbc and found that the browse button now stopped complaining about \"Browsing requires pysmbc module\" but it still could not find any shares until I entered the workgroup and host name manually, so it read \"smb://workgroup/hostname\". It then found the host and I could click on that to find the printer. I did not enter the shared printer name because it had spaces in it, which are not allowed.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but installing python-smbc and python3-smbc did not help. I added my experiences on the bug page as well. A workaround for me was to enter the exact host name and share name in the text field, so it reads \"smb://hostname/sharename\". I had to go over to the Windows server and find the field that says \"Share this printer as...\".\n", "Q: Existing ubuntu image convert to reburn dvd for installation so my buddy had a local pc shop put ubuntu on his home desktop though now he wants that same version installed onto his vista laptop he's otherwise  done with.

I don't want to go through all the steps to find it isnt or something is wrong. \nThank you for reading and helping!\nhttp://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/11.10/\n\nA: Yes, this is exactly the site where you need to get the old releases' ISOs from.\nHowever, it is disrecommended to install a End Of Life version of Ubuntu. You will receive neither real support, nor any security updates.\nI doubt your friend will have problems with using Trusty or Utopic, since both use Unity as their default Desktop Environment, like Oneiric does. I doubt that your friend will even notice any difference.\nIf, however, you still plan to install Oneiric on his computer, you are free to do so. Then just get the correct ISO from the link in your question.\n\nPS: If you have an USB stick with more than 1GB, use UNetBootin to extract the ISO to this empty stick. It will then behave like an Ubuntu DVD on boot. After the installation, you can wipe the stick and use it normally again. This will save you a DVD.\n\nA: Use Clonezilla, clone the hard drive to an external and restore it to the new drive.\nhttp://clonezilla.org/\nAlternatively, you can also just swap the hard drive from the old machine to the new one.\nThe URL for the old download is correct, just verify if it is 32 or 64 bit they currently have installed and download and use the correct version!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 desktop environment does not load I am running (or at least trying to run) Ubuntu desktop 14.04.2 LTS on a Dell Optiplex 760 with intel Core2 Quad Q8300 CPU and an intel 4 series integrated graphics controller (uname -a :Linux systemname 3.13.0-53-generic #87-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 7 14:32:24 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux).

Is there any way to go first to destination directory then store the path in some variable lets suppose X and then go to source directory and write a command like that: \n mv * $X\n\n\nA: Try: \ncd /your/long/path\nX=$(pwd) \n\nThe command pwd prints the current directory; with the command X=$(pwd) you are storing the output of the command in the variable(1) X (no spaces around the =!)\ncd /the/other/dir/\nmv * \"$X\"\n\nNow you are using the value of the variable X, using $X (read $ as \"the value of\"). The \" that are around the $X are needed if the directory name contains spaces or other special characters. \nIf you are unsure about what is in X, you can check its content with \necho \"$X\" \n\n\n(1) in the bash (and other) shells they are called parameters. See for example here for a simple tutorial, or here. \n\nA: Assuming your shell is bash, you can use\npushd /your/long/directory\npopd\nmv ./* \"$OLDPWD\"\n\n$OLDPWD is set by bash when you change directories.\n\nA: Some time ago I've tried to create a more elaborate version of X=$(pwd) and mv * $X. The result was something that I call a \"bashPortalGun\". Here it is:\nhttps://github.com/tyukiand/bashPortalGun\nThese scripts transform your shell prompt into something like this:\nme@host [orange -> there] here$ \n\nand allow you to do everything you would expect from a \"portal gun\", applied to the\ncontext of the bash-shell:\nme@host ~$ cd /very/long/path\nme@host /very/long/path$ pOrange # create orange portal\nme@host [orange -> .portal.closed] /very/long/path$ cd /some/other/directory\nme@host /some/other/directory$ pBlue # create blue portal\nme@host [blue -> path] /some/other/directory$ mv file.txt [orange] # move stuff through portal\n\nIn my experience, it makes the usage of mv and cd more comfortable, especially when working with multiple shells. Maybe you find it useful, maybe you just consider it cool to have a portal gun in your bash :)\nMotivated test subjects are welcome. Constructive feedback will be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Suppose you are now in the directory with files you want to move, use\ncd target_dir\ncd -\n\nto store your target_dir in $OLDPWD variable, and move back to your original directory.\nNow, you may use\nmv * \"$OLDPWD\"\n\nto move your files to your target directory.\n\nNotes:\n$PWD(Print Working Directory) always remebers current working directory.\nAnd $OLDPWD always remebers last working directory.\nBy the way, use TAB key to auto-complete your path when typing your path.\n\nA: It's perhaps easier to just create temporary symbolic links instead of variables.\nIt's also not all that \"un-handy\" to use \"tab\" auto-completion/suggestions. But may depend on one's individual .bashrc, I'm not sure.\n\nA: Why do not use variables for src and dest-Path?\nHere a little script:\nIFS='\n'\nSRC=\"/PATH/TO/SOURCE-PATH\"\nDST=\"/PATH/TO/DEST-PATH\"\nfor i in `ls $SRC` \ndo\nmv $SRC/$i $DST/.\ndone\n\nthe IFS is important, if you have filenames with spaces.

I am completely new to a Linux operating system and was trying to setup Owncloud to use as a file server.

I am logged in as administrator but it tells me I am not the owner and do not have permission to access or make changes to any of the other folders. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Best way to do it is to copy needed files as root \nsudo cp -r ORIGIN DESTINATION\n\nYou also can change folder owner to yourself with \nchown USER.GROUP DIRECTORY\n\nor give write access to it to everyone with \nchmod 777 DIRECTORY\n\nThese are more dangerous, be careful when doing this and use only with no outer access to the directory.\nIf you feel yourself better when working with GUI, you can try launching your file manager as root, \nsudo nautilus\n\nfor example.

To do this, you can follow steps to install the proprietary drivers either through Additional Drivers or by following steps similar to those in Is Ubuntu recognizing and/or using my NVIDIA graphics card?\n", "Q: evdev can't distinguish certain keys on Tivo Slide Pro I have a Tivo Slide Pro RF remote with its USB receiver connected to an Ubuntu 14.04 system. It works in HID mode and looks like a keyboard.\nMost keys work fine through evdev, but there's four keys that all send the same evdev events, and I can't find any way to distinguish among these four keys. Running evtest shows the following events when I press & release any one of these four keys:\nEvent: time 1415581661.700911, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 40 (ABS_MISC), value 0\nEvent: time 1415581661.700911, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------\nEvent: time 1415581662.028970, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 40 (ABS_MISC), value 1\nEvent: time 1415581662.028970, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------\n\nThe USB key is designed to be plugged into a TiVo, which obviously has some way to distinguish. Where do I start tracking this down?\n\nA: It turns out the special TiVo Slide driver was not being used for this new model of remote because the USB ID was not updated in the driver source. Specifically this line from hid-ids.h should read:\n#define USB_DEVICE_ID_TIVO_SLIDE        0x1203\n\n(While that works for the new TiVo Slide Pro, it breaks the older TiVo Slide.)\n", "Q: How to set mplayer as the default video application in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

I work on two 1900x1200 monitors, usually with at least one monitor running a fullscreen terminal window. I use a font size of Ubuntu mono 10.\nI have noticed that performance is sluggish (I am using an i7, 16gb ram, etc.).

Or are there better performing alternatives to the default? I am using Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Does your problem reproduce under different conditions?\nCan you reproduce the problem under different conditions and benchmark the time it takes to perform various operations (ex: time cat largefile.txt).

Configurational options\nIf the block is meant to block not-so-experienced users from using certain applications, editing (a local copy of) the application's desktop file (as described in [1]) is probably the fastest and easiest way.\nSome additional things can be done to create an extra barrier and/or to prevent the fact that the user finds out too easily what we've done to block the application ([2] and [3]). \nThe set up is not fit for unattended situations with experienced users. In \"home\" situations with average users it will be sufficient in many cases.\n1.Example for blocking gedit by editing (a local version of) the .desktop file\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the application's desktop file in /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop\n\n\n*Edit the file: open it with gedit (while you still can :)) by dragging it over an open gedit window.\n\n\n*\n\n*replace the line\nExec=gedit %U\n\nby:\nExec=zenity --info --text 'You are not allowed to use this application'\n\n\n*remove the (possible) shortcuts, to prevent starting the application from one of the shortcuts:\nremove the line (for the gedit example):\nActions=Window;Document;\n\nand the section(s) like:\n[Desktop Action Window]\nName=Open a New Window\nExec=gedit --new-window\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nFrom then on (after log out / log in) the user will see this message if he or she tries to open gedit from Dash, or tries to open a file that is linked to the application:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Hiding the application from Dash (optional measure)\nAfter we made the changes above, having the gedit.desktop file still open, we can add an additional line:\nNoDisplay=true\n\nBy adding this line, gedit will not even show up in Dash.\nUndo\nTo undo, simply remove the local .desktop file from ~/.local/share/applications\n2.Making it a bit more difficult to find out\nWhile, after editing the .desktop file, the application will not show up in Dash any more, Dash search will still show our newly created gedit.desktop file, which might unintentionally give a hint how to escape the application block.\n\nTo avoid that, we should exclude the directory ~/.local/share/applications from Dash search and clear the search history. \nOpen System Settings > \"Security & Privacy\" > \"Files & Applications\" (tab). Add the directory ~/.local/share/applications to the list to exclude from search.\n\n3.(Not) using the terminal / command line\nRedirecting the gedit command (1)\nEditing the .desktop file prevents using the application from Dash, but if the user knows the AltF2combination and the command to run the application, he or she will still be able to start the application, just like with the terminal. A nice and easy to set up extra measure is to create (if it doesn't exist yet) the directory ~/bin and create a small script in the directory:\n#!/bin/bash\nzenity --info --text 'You are not allowed to use this application'\n\nMake it executable and name it after the application; gedit in this case.\nSince ~/bin is in PATH, running the command will call the script instead of the \"real\" gedit application. As a result, the same You are not allowed to use this application -message will appear\nRedirecting the gedit command (2)\nAnother way (with more limited effect, see note) of redirecting the application's command is to add an alias to the .bashrc file:\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nadd the line (gedit example):\nalias gedit='zenity --info --text \"You are not allowed to use this application\"'\n\nNote: this is only to be used as an extra measure, since it only prevents the application to be called from the terminal directly. Double clicking on a (e.g.) .txt file will however still open the application.\nMake the use of terminal difficult or impossible at all\nTo prevent the use of the terminal, you can also do the same trick on the gnome-terminal.desktop - file as in [1], and/or change the default shortcut key combination to run the terminal (System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Starters\")\n\n4. A small tool to automatically create (or undo) an edited version of the .desktop file (as in 1.)\nIf you run the script below with either the argument block or unblock (you must run it with either one), you will be presented a list with (global) desktop files, representing your installed applications:\n\nPick one, and your application is blocked or unblocked, depending on the argument you run it with.\nNote\nYou may have to log out / log in to make it work.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport sys\n\nmode = sys.argv[1]\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\nglobal_dir = \"/usr/share/applications/\"\n\nfiles = [file for file in os.listdir(global_dir) if file.endswith(\".desktop\")]\nrelevant = []\nfor i in range(len(files)):\n    file = files[i]\n    with open(global_dir+file) as src:\n        text = src.read()\n    if not \"NoDisplay=true\" in text:\n        relevant.append((file))\nfor i in range (len(relevant)):\n    print(str(i+1)+\".\", relevant[i])\n\nchoice = int(input(\"\\nplease enter the number of the corresponding .desktop file: \"))\nfilename = relevant[choice-1]\n\nlocal_file = home+\"/\"+\".local/share/applications/\"+filename\nglobal_file = global_dir+filename\n\ndef block_application(filename):\n    if not os.path.exists(local_file):\n        shutil.copyfile(global_file, local_file)\n    with open(local_file) as src:\n        lines = src.readlines()\n    shortcuts_section = [i for i in range(len(lines)) if lines[i].startswith(\"Actions=\")]\n    if len(shortcuts_section) != 0:\n        lines = lines[:shortcuts_section[0]]\n    command = [i for i in range(len(lines)) if lines[i].startswith(\"Exec=\")]\n    if len(command) != 0:\n        lines[command[0]] = 'Exec=zenity --info --text \"You are not allowed to use this application\"\\n'\n    with open(local_file, \"wt\") as out:\n        for line in lines:\n            out.write(line)\n\nif mode == \"block\":\n    block_application(filename)\nelif mode == \"unblock\":\n    os.remove(local_file)\n\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as block_apps.py and run it by either:\npython3 /path/to/block_apps.py block\n\nor\npython3 /path/to/block_apps.py unblock\n\nB. Scripted option(s)\nBlocking certain applications can also be done by running a script in the background. The script would have to take certain actions if one of the \"forbidden\" applications is run.\n1. Script to manipulate the screen when forbidden applications are used.\nThe script below offers a flexible way to block user defined applications. It runs with a simple command, with the forbidden applications as an argument, e.g. (assuming you made the script executable):\n    /path/to/block_apps.py firefox gedit gnome-terminal\n\nThe advantage of blocking applications like this is that it is flexible; even within one account, different settings can be used, simply by using other applications as argument.\nWhat it does\nBy un- commenting one of the lines:\n# action = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --brightness 0\"\n\nor \n# action = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --rotate inverted\"\n\nThe script either:\nblacks the screen (action = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --brightness 0\"):\n\nor turns it upside down (action = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --rotate inverted\"):\n(who said Unity doesn't allow to put the launcher on the right?)\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport sys\nimport time\n\napplications = []\ni = 1\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        applications.append(sys.argv[i])\n        i = i+1\n    except IndexError:\n        break\n\ncmd1 = \"xrandr\"\nget = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd1]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\nscreen = [get[i-1] for i in range(len(get)) if get[i] == \"connected\"][0]\n\n#-- uncomment (only) one of the options below\n# action = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --brightness 0\"\naction = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --rotate inverted\"\n#--\n\nwhile True:\n    cmd2 = \"ps -u \"+getpass.getuser()\n    applist = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd2]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    for application in applications:\n        if application in applist:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", action])\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as block_apps.py, make it executable\n\n*run it by the command:\n/path/to/block_apps.py <application_1> <application_2> <application_3> etc...\n\n\n*ImportantTo kill the block_apps.py script and restore \"normal\" settings, use the script below (make it available under a shortcut key combination):\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\ncmd = \"ps -ef | grep block_apps.py\"\nrun = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\")\nmatch = [line for line in run if \"block_apps.py\" in line]\ncommand = \"kill \"+match[0].split()[1]\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\ncmd1 = \"xrandr\"\nget = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd1]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\nscreen = [get[i-1] for i in range(len(get)) if get[i] == \"connected\"][0]\n\nrestore_1 = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --brightness 1\"\nrestore_2 = \"xrandr --output \"+screen+\" --rotate normal\"\n\nfor item in [restore_1, restore_2]:\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", item])\n\nAs always with scripts, copy it into an empty file, save it as kill_blockapps.py, make it executable and run it by:\n/path/to/kill_blockapps.py\n\nYou will probably want to have this one under a shortcut key: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". \nClick the \"+\" and add the command as above.\n", "Q: How can I change out the LXDE panel/menu for a better one? I changed out Unity for LXDE because this old desktop just couldn't handle the load well. The problem is that the menu is plain and somewhat difficult to work with. Is there a way to replace it with something a little more user friendly? Specifically, I know some distros have a search box in the LXDE menu. What are my options?\nThanks!\n\nA: One possibility is to install the Whisker menu. This is part of Xubuntu but if you install it, you'll have the necessary dependencies pulled in. Then, you'll need to use the xfce4 panel instead of the lxde one. In my opinion, there shouldn't be much of an additional burden. To install the Whisker menu, run this:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin xfce4-panel\n\nThere's a video on Xubuntu which shows you a bit about the Whisker menu to help you decide.\nAnd the developer's blog is here: Whisker Menu 1.3.0 released!\n", "Q: Error apt-get update on ubuntu 14.10 i get an error when i update my ubuntu 14.10\nthis is an error :\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net utopic/main amd64 Packages                        \n  404  Not Found\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net utopic/main i386 Packages                         \n  404  Not Found\nIgn http://kambing.ui.ac.id trusty/universe Translation-en_US                  \nFetched 22,6 MB in 4min 12s (89,5 kB/s)                                        \nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tualatrix/ppa/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tualatrix/ppa/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

When you upgrade to a new distribution or install the latest one, not all developers have produced a working application for that version. APT automagically looks for the version name folder on the PPA source in your Software Sources.\nIn your case, 14.04 and 14.10 are similar enough that applications are likely to work on either one. (I've tested myself, they are plenty similar.)\nTo make this source update from 14.04 (Trusty) you can just open your Software & Updates application, switch tabs to Other Software, and look for the checked entry containing ppa.launchpad.net/tualatrix/ppa/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main.\nOnce you find it, you can select it, edit it, and change the Distribution field to \"trusty\". (no quotations) To finish up just run sudo apt-get update again.\nI recommend checking back with the developer's page to see if they have updated their software to 14.10, if so, just go back into the Software Sources and set the distribution back to \"utopic\".\n", "Q: Grub rescue, what to do?

I am trying to braodcast a http website over wifi using my laptop to enable my smartphone to connect to this website just by using wifi connection and a web browser.\nThe goal is to create my private network so I can brodcast websites containing media that I can access using my smartphone with no configuration or app and of course without any need for an internet connection for both the smartphone and laptop.\nDoes anyone have an idea?\nAnd Thanks.   \n\nA: The website is listening on a port, usually 80, on you laptop.  Assuming you can connect to \"localhost\" with a browser (on the laptop) and connect to the website, then all is well. \nYour laptop has an ip address, such as 192.168.0.100 for example.  You should be able to use that address instead of localhost on your laptop, and you should also be able to use that same address from any computer on your LAN; ie, http://192.168.0.100, or whatever the actual address is.  For other computers that run linux, windows, or OSX, you can enter an alias in the hosts files so you can type a name, instead of the numbers, such as http://laptop.\nIf you want to connect from both inside and outside your LAN, you can use a dynamic IP address service that can direct requests to the website.  \nYou can actually have multiple virtual websites running on the laptop either way.  I use dyndns, for which I pay a small amount each year.  I can access my server by using something like http://myname.homelinux.net, or many other URLs.\n\nA: Have you bound your httpd/apache2 to the correct IP address for your WiFi connection? I know on my computer it defaults to my ethernet card and I must manually bind it to the IP address for my WiFi card.\nMake sure you've added Listen 192.168.X.X:80 to your apache2.conf or httpd.conf file using whatever the IP address for your WiFi card is. Older versions of Apache on Ubuntu will use httpd.conf, newer use apache2.conf which is located in /etc/apache2.\nCheck here:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/bind.html\nor here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/httpd.html\nfor more information.\nIf you want to do this without being connected to another wireless access point or router, you can probably use hostapd to set a static wireless access point on your WiFi interface, still pointing apache2.conf to that IP address.\nAs far as how to \"host the page,\" take a look at your apache2.conf file about a third of the way down you'll see a line that's commented out with #. It should look like  #ServerRoot \"/etc/apache2\" This is how you'll point apache to the folder for the root of the site. You should probably have a look at the second link I posted, it'll give you a better idea of how to set up what you want, and be much more informative than me rewriting what they have posted there. There are many ways to set up a properly working site, depending on what you are planning on serving. Essentially, you could drop your 'index.html' file in the /var/www/html directory, uncomment the line and it will work. But you then need to symlink to the media files you want to serve or move them to the /var/www/html directory in the same manner in which you're referencing them in your html files. \nOnce you edit the apache2.conf file, run:  sudo apache2ctl graceful from the command line to restart apache with your new settings.\n\nA: Sounds like you want something like plex or emby.  I don't run either because I've written my own solution, but it doesn't do video.\n\nA: Open a web browser on your phone and navigate to your web page, using your internal ip address.

I am trying to create some soft of a sandbox for linux systems (ubuntu).\nMy main goal is to find out which files are executed by a bash script of my choice, without actually letting it run them.\nI also want to prevent changes to the system, so the running script will think he has the ability to write to files but it actually doesn't. I don't want to run the bash script under low permissions, because them it will fail to run if it tries to change something.\nPlease don't suggest running it through a virtual machince, it's too slow for me.\nThe only thing that comes to my mind is hooking any write syscall so when it tries to write to a file, the system will return SUCCESS but do nothing. Also hooking any execution syscall to capture all programs executed by the script and prevent executing other files while returning success to the script. But I have to clue on how to do this.\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Try using an overlay, with a chroot. First, decide the path you want to chroot to, and make sure it exists, and similarly for the path you will overlay on / (which is where modifications will go):\nmkdir -p /chroot\nmkdir -p /tmp/tmproot\n\nI chose a directory in /tmp/ as it's a tmpfs on my system (possibly unadvisable, but OK for me), so no changes should reach the disk. You can use a squashfs and mount it somewhere, and use that as the overlay, but that has the problem of being read-only, I think.\nNow:\n$ mount -t overlayfs -o lowerdir=/,upperdir=/tmp/tmproot overlayfs /chroot/\n$ chroot /chroot/ /bin/bash -l\nroot:/$ touch test\nroot:/$ ls\n...  sys  test  tmp  ...\nroot:/$ logout\n$ ls /\n...  sys  tmp  ...\n$ ls /tmp/tmproot/\nroot  test\n\nIf you make the upperdir independent of a physical disk (perhaps by using tmpfs), this should protect the lowerdir.\nNote the creation of a root folder - that's for my .bash_history. A copy was made of the original .bash_history, and then appended to.\n\nA: Here's an impossibility result: The behavior of a script may depend on information that it wrote to a file earlier. If you don't actually allow it to write to the file (but make the script believe it did write to the file), then you may influence the script's behavior in a way that wouldn't happen if you ran it \"for real\".\nFor instance:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwrite_bit_to_file () {\n    # write a random bit to a file\n    echo $((RANDOM % 2)) >> file.txt\n}\n\nget_bit_from_file () {\n    # read the random bit from the file\n    tail -1 file.txt\n}\n\n# MAIN SCRIPT\n#############\n\n# ... do some stuff, save some info for later ...\nwrite_bit_to_file\n# ... do more stuff, retrieve info from file ...\nif (( $(get_bit_from_file) )); then\n    # access foo.txt and do something\n    echo \"I'm going to access foo.txt\"\nelse\n    # access bar.txt and do something\n    echo \"I'm going to access bar.txt\"\nfi\n\nThis is obviously a very artificial script, but I hope you get the point: if the script does not actually write to file.txt, but believes it does, you will either get an error (e.g., if file.txt does not exist) or unexpected behavior (e.g., if file.txt does exist, but contains other information than expected, because write_bit_to_file did not actually write to the file). If you ran the script for real, however, it would behave as expected (e.g., randomly access either foo.txt or bar.txt).\nWhat may be possible is to write a monitor that executes your script, observes the files it writes to, makes a backup of these files before that happens, and at the end of the script restores those files to their original state. But that would be pretty nasty ;)\nEdit: In this answer, muru suggests a really good way to implement something akin to this monitor, and even better, since it never affects your actual root filesystem and preserves modification of files done by scripts to be re-used later. That's the way to go! :-)\n", "Q: How to create multiple debian packages using the same debian directory I am packaging an application in my PC for installation/distribution purposes.

How do I get the workspace navigator to switch automatically to the VLC in workspace 1-2?\n\nA: The script below will change the current viewport to the one where any new window appears.\nThe script does not add any noticeable/measureable burden (using system monitor) to your system.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef get_wlist():\n    # get the output of wmctrl -lG, try because wmctrl is a bit buggy :)\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lG\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef get_wids(currlist):\n    # get the window ids\n    return [l.split()[0] for l in currlist.splitlines()]\n\ndef get_abspos():\n    posdate = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-d\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()\n    return [int(n) for n in posdate[5].split(\",\")]\n\nwhile True:\n    # wait until the desktop is ready to run wmctrl\n    wdata1 = get_wlist()\n    if wdata1:\n        break\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n# and then...\nwlist1 = get_wids(wdata1)\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    wdata2 = get_wlist()\n    if wdata2:\n        wlist2 = get_wids(wdata2)\n        new = [w for w in wlist2 if not w in wlist1]\n        for item in new:\n            line = wdata2.splitlines()[wlist2.index(item)].split()\n            pos = [int(line[n]) for n in [2, 3]]\n            absposcount = get_abspos()\n            abspos = [str(pos[0]+absposcount[0]), str(pos[1]+absposcount[1])]\n            # print(abspos)\n            subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-o\", \",\".join(abspos)])\n        wlist1 = wlist2; wdata1 = wdata2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as move_toviewport.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_toviewport.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add.

On the 9th of November I tried installing the last stable release of BasKet Note Pads which apparently is not supported off the bat because it needs to be ported to QT4 and KDE 4, whatever that means. The program has been ported but it is, as of 2010, in beta phase meaning it is basically buggy and lacks the functionality that I need.\nAs such, I tried installing BasKet v1.x which needed QT3 and a bunch of other things I don't know much about. I tried installing them and ended up filling 20% of my 15 GB hard drive. Of course, I never got BasKet to work but the packages I installed are still there and now I need to effectively uninstall everything I installed that day.\nIs there a command to uninstall all packages installed on a certain date (in my case, the 9th of November) ?\n\nA: Incase you know the dates on which you installed these packages, the best way I've found to remove them automatically is the below command :\ngrep \"2015-12-19.*.install \" /var/log/dpkg.log | awk '{ print $4 }' | cut -d: -f1 \n\nThe above will list all packages installed on the date in the command.

I see that I actually have two hard drives on this computer: Disk 0 a ST500LT012-9WS142, and Disk 1 a SanDisk SSD U100 24GB. At the Disk 0 I have several partitions, one of them is OS (C:) and another is DATA (D:), and I have several others which I don't know their purposes, together with one partition for recovery. Disk 1, the SSD, is divided into two partitions.\nWould it be beneficial to install the Ubuntu on the SSD (will it give better performance?), and if it is, how should I proceed to doing this?\n\nA: I've just got an Asus Vivobook S46CA (i7 / 6GB RAM / 20GB SSD / 1TB HDD), with Windows 8 pre-installed by factory.\nI've tried a bit to install the Ubuntu 14 as a dual boot with Windows 8. But I was not successful. So I have decided to remove Windows and install Ubuntu 14. Be aware that I'm a beginner in Linux world and my answer might be improved somehow by a more experienced user.

Please refer to that document.\n1TB HDD:\n. 200GB for /usr\n. 400GB for /home\n. 400GB for /DATA (personal media files)  \nThat has worked pretty fine (1 day after). I've formatted all partitions as \"primary\" and EXT4. It feels that the speed was improved. The boot loader was kept at the 1TB HDD. Everything was done using Ubuntu's 14.10 live session CD, GParted (to remove the old Windows 8 partitions and set the new partitions configuration), and the Ubuntu's installation wizard.\n\nA: SSD in Asus s400ca used to cache frequently used blocks on main HDD.\nDespite on it, it is not so easy to install Ubuntu due to UEFI on this machine. \nSo, the easiest way for study purposes is install Ubuntu inside of VirtualBox under Windows.\n", "Q: How to install ns2 on Ubuntu If I upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04, will NS2 still be supported?\nI am currently using NS2 on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Yes, NS2 is available in 14.04 repository.

I'm trying to find all patterns between a pair of double quotes. Let say I have a file with contents look like as following:\nfirst matched is \"One\". the second is here\"Two \"\nand here are in second line\" Three \"\"Four\".\n\nI want to below words as output:\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\n\nAs you can see all strings in output are between a pair of quotes.\nWhat I tried, is this command:\ngrep -Po ' \"\\K[^\"]*' file\n\nAbove command works fine if I have a space before first pair of \" marks. For example it works if my input file contains the following:\nfirst matched is \"One\". the second is here \"Two \"\nand here are in second line \" Three \" \"Four\".\n\nI know I can do this with multiple commands combination. But I'm looking for one command and without using that for multiple time. e.g: below command\ngrep -oP '\"[^\"]*\"' file | grep -oP '[^\"]*'\n\nHow can I achieve/print all of my patterns just using one command?\nReply to comments: It's not important for me to removing whitespace around matched pattern inside a pair of quotes, but it would be better if the command support it too. and also my files contain nested quotes like \"foo \"bar\" zoo\". And all of the quoted words are in separate lines and they are not expanded to multi lines.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First of all, your grep -Po '\"\\K[^\"]*' file idea fails because grep sees both \"One\" and \". the second is here\" as being inside quotes. Personally, I'd probably just do\n$ grep -oP '\"[^\"]+\"' file | tr -d '\"'\nOne\nTwo \n Three \nFour\n\nBut that is two commands. To do it with a single command, you could use one of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perl\n$ perl -lne '@F=/\"\\s*([^\"]+)\\s*\"/g; print for @F' file \nOne\nTwo \nThree \nFour\n\nHere, the @F array holds all matches of the regex (a quote, followed by as many non-\" as possible until the next \"). The print for @F just means \"print each element of @F.\n\n*Perl\n$ perl -F'\"' -lne 'for($i=1;$i<=$#F;$i+=2){print $F[$i]}' file \nOne\nTwo \n Three \nFour\n\nTo remove leading/trailing spaces from each match, use this:\nperl -F'\"' -lne 'for($i=1;$i<=$#F;$i+=2){$F[$i]=~s/^\\s*|\\s$//; print $F[$i]}' file \n\nHere, Perl is behaving like awk. The -a switch causes it to automatically split input lines into fields on the character given by -F. Since I have given it \", the fields are:\n$ perl -F'\"' -lne 'for($i=0;$i<=$#F;$i++){print \"Field $i: $F[$i]\"}' file \nField 0: first matched is \nField 1: One\nField 2: . the second is here\nField 3: Two \nField 0: and here are in second line\nField 1:  Three \nField 2: \nField 3: Four\nField 4: .\n\nBecause we are looking for text between two consecutive field separators, we know we want every second field. So, for($i=1;$i<=$#F;$i+=2){print $F[$i]} will print the ones we care about.\n\n*The same idea but in awk:\n$ awk -F'\"' '{for(i=2;i<=NF;i+=2){print $(i)}}' file \nOne\nTwo \n Three \nFour\n\n\nA: The key is to consume the quotes in your expression. Hard to do that with a single grep command. Here's a perl one-liner:\nperl -0777 -nE 'say for /\"(.*?)\"/sg' file\n\nThat slurps the whole input and prints out the captured part of the match. It will work even if there's a newline inside the quotes, although it then becomes difficult to separate elements with and without newlines. To help with that, use a different character as the output record separator, the null character for instance\nperl -0777 -lne 'print for /\"(.*?)\"/sg} BEGIN {$\\=\"\\0\"' <<DATA | od -c\nblah \"first\" blah \"second\nquote with newline\" blah \"third\"\nDATA\n\n0000000   f   i   r   s   t  \\0   s   e   c   o   n   d  \\n   q   u   o\n0000020   t   e       w   i   t   h       n   e   w   l   i   n   e  \\0\n0000040   t   h   i   r   d  \\0\n0000046\n\n\nA: This could be possible with the below grep one liner and i assumed that you have balanced quotation marks.\ngrep -oP '\"\\s*\\K[^\"]+?(?=\\s*\"(?:[^\"]*\"[^\"]*\")*[^\"]*$)' file\n\nExample:\n$ cat file\nfirst matched is \"One\". the second is here\"Two \"\nand here are in second line\" Three \"\"Four\".\n$ grep -oP '\"\\s*\\K[^\"]+?(?=\\s*\"(?:[^\"]*\"[^\"]*\")*[^\"]*$)' file\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\n\nAnother hair pulling solution through PCRE verb (*SKIP)(*F),\n$ grep -oP '[^\"]+(?=(?:\"[^\"]*\"[^\"]*)*[^\"]*$)(*SKIP)(*F)|\\s*\\K[^\"]+(?=\\b\\s*)' file\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\n\n\nA: Using sed:\nsed 's/[^\"]*\"\\([^\"]\\+\\)\"[^\"]*/\\1\\n/g' file\n\n\n[^\"]*\n\nThe ^ at the beginning of [^\"]* ... means that the characters listed in the character class should not match(only match single \"). The * means \" can occur zero or more times.\n\"\\([^\"]\\+\\)\"\n\nEverything inside \\(...\\) is a matching group. The first character outside of the matching group is the start match. A character class [^\"] is following(It matches every character except of the \"). The quantifier \\+ means there must be at least one character between the quotes(\"...\") in your input file. Then \\), the end of the matching group. This matching group can be access by its index via \\1.\nThe last part [^\"]* is the same as the first part that matches everything until the next \".\n\nA: Alternative approach with Python that doesn't require regular expressions (although not exactly robust), is to process each line in your textfile character by character. \nBasic idea of how this works: if we see double quote and no flag raised - raise the flag, and if we see it again and flag is raised - lower the flag. When the flag is raised - that's how we know we're within double quotes, so we can store the subsequent characters.

Does ubuntu run on any other devices besides personal computers?\n\nA: Ubuntu for tablets and smartphones is in development.You can already try to use them if you feel adventurous.There is also Ubuntu for netbooks.\nHowever Ubuntu is a version of GNU/Linux.And there are versions of Linux that run on devices ranging from microwaves up to supercomputers.There are cars with Linux.Android is also a version of Linux.\nWith enough knowledge and tweaking you could run Ubuntu on anything with sufficient processing power.\n\nA: I run Ubuntu on my BeagleBone Black.\nI hear that other people run Ubuntu on Gumstix.\n", "Q: System directly booting to Windows without showing GRUB menu I have a hp pavillion 15 n203tx with preinstalled Windows 8.1. \nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 in it, and then it used to show a GRUB menu every time I turned on the machine. The menu said something like:\n1. Ubuntu \n2. Advanced options for Ubuntu \n3. Windows Boot Manager(on /dev/sda2) \n4. System Setup\n\nEverything was working well. If I wanted to run Ubuntu I chose the Ubuntu option and if I wanted to boot Windows then I chose the third option of Windows Boot Manager.\nOut of curiosity once I tried that last option-system setup, and a new menu loaded up, a startup menu showing the following options- \n1. f1 system information \n2. f2 system diagnostics \n3. f9 boot device options \n4. f10 bios setup \n5. f11 system recovery\n\nenter- continue setup\n\nthen I pressed enter and Windows started booting. Since then, my system is booting directly to Windows without showing the GRUB menu. \nIf I want to see that grub menu, I have to press the esc key on starting my system. Then the startup menu appears (which I have mentioned above) and I have to press f9. Then I am presented with a boot menu options screen with the following options:\n1. OS boot manager\n2. Ubuntu\n3. Boot from EFI file\n\nI have to select the second option to get to the GRUB menu. \nI want my system to work as it did earlier.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, but it sounds like F9 would be the right choice. I'm not sure though because every PC I've ever owned uses F12 to select a boot device. If F9 doesn't work try F12. Basically you want to get to the menu where you'd select a boot device (like when you're booting from a live usb) and choose the correct partition.\nAll you have to do is arrow down to the partition ((device) with Ubuntu installed and press enter. Then open a terminal and type sudo update-grub. It should find Ubuntu and re-add it to the grub menu.\n\nA: In my case, I had to press and hold the Shift button during the boot of the system.\nThis should allow the grub menu to show up. Then you only need access Ubuntu and set the grub options via \"boot repair\" or similar programs.\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a separate SSD than windows and swap drive to use both I have windows 8 laptop whose hard drive could be swapped easily. From my previous dual boot experience, working with windows 8 and ubuntu at the same time could cause some trouble. Also, I am using a 256 GB SSD now so I do not want to partition the disk for ubuntu. So, I am thinking about installing ubuntu on a separate SSD, and switch the hard drives to use each of them. Before I actually do that, will I run into trouble booting any of them?\nBy the way, I noticed that the same hard drive can boot on different computers for a mac system, is that also the case for linux?\n\nA: \nBefore I actually do that, will I run into trouble booting any of\n  them?\n\nNo, this should work without any problems. Back in the 90s, I remember this to be a typical multiboot-scenario :)\n\nBy the way, I noticed that the same hard drive can boot on different\n  computers for a mac system, is that also the case for linux?\n\nIt usually works, as long as you are using Ubuntus default kernel, but there could be problems with some modules (drivers) until you regenerate your initial ramdisk on the new hardware. To do so, execute sudo update-initramfs -u -k all. \nIf you use another kernel and run into a kernel-panic, it will probably help to use a live-linux-system like grml to boot and use chroot to generate the new ramdisk: \nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nmount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash\nsource /etc/profile\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\n\nI'm assuming that your root-partition is /dev/sda1 and that you are root inside the live-system. In case /boot is an own partition, it needs to be mounted too. \n", "Q: Can I change permissions from the original user to one added later I am pretty new to Ubuntu (in case that fact is not immediately obvious). \nI setup a machine with Ubuntu 14.04 for some people in our church.

As administrator, I want to be able to see all files that they add or edit. I tried adding root permissions to my account with 'visudo' but that did not give me the access I wanted.\nI cannot determine how to grant access to my account for their files. In addition, I do not even have access to the primary partition on the hard drive, or to USB drives that are inserted into the computer. Please explain how I can gain access to view and modify their files, and how I can access the primary drive and USB drives that may be added.\nThe drive partition and USB drives are listed under media/firstuser. The firstuser folder is owned by root. I added my user name to root group, but still cannot access the firstuser folder.\nAnd since appreciation is not to be added later, thank you in advance. :-)\n\nA: Probably the most novice friendly solution for browsing files is to start nautilus with root privileges.\ngksu nautilus\n\nIf you want to change permissions for files you should have a look at chmod. See also here http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml\nIt might be that you encrypted the home partition of the other user. If that is the case and you don't have the password for the other user, you are however out of luck.\n\nA: I have had same problem like you, and you proabaly need to use thunar, and to do this you have to enter in the terminal this:\n  sudo -i\n  gksudo thunar\n\nand then you can alter promising to all of you files, and it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Scope settings - what does \"list\" type returns? i am trying to get the string selected from a list (defined in the settings.ini with name [listname]) using this code:\nunity::scopes::VariantMap config = settings();\nstd::string selected_string = config[\"listname\"].get_string();\n\nHowever it says this:\nScopeBase::run(): unity::LogicException: Variant does not contain a string value:\nboost::bad_get: failed value get using boost::get\n\nWhat does the Variant variable contain?

Recently, I switched to LXDE due to performance issues with Unity. I've always liked LXDE, just I needed to tweak it to make it better. My favorit improvement is to add a dock bar to the bottom of the screen and move the panel to the top. However, Docky always asks for compositing. My various searches found ways to start it manually, but never a way for it to start with the UI. So my question is: How do I start compositing in LXDE to where it starts when I log in?\n\nA: When I clicked AskUbuntu to post this question, I searched one more thing and finally got the answer in the form of a youtube video. No tutorials exist that I could find. Therefore, please enjoy this post:\n\nThe first step is to install the manager that is going to be doing the work:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xcompmgr\n This will go through the usual install routine. Once it is done, you need to run the following:\nleafpad ~/.config/autostart/xcompmgr.desktop\n And paste the following:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=XCompositing Manager\nGenericName=Compiz\nComment=This enables Compositing for LXDE\nExec=xcompmgr -n\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=dropbox\nCategories=\nStartupNotify=false\nName[en_US]=Xcompmgr\nComment[en_US]=This was created by Geary\n\n\nSave it and open your file manager to ~/.config/autostart and run the xcompmgr plug in.

After the arp entries were added, the pings simply time out.\nIt is probably not a firewall problem, for I have never used iptables on either of these machines (sudo iptables -L gives the default output on both hosts). I have rebooted both machines and the router, but so far nothing helps.\nThings worked until yesterday, when I disconnected and reconnected one of the hosts. What am I overlooking?\nEdit: I ran a tcpdump arp from host 101, and sure enough, I got numerous requests like the following:\n23:12:23.460191 ARP, Request who-has hallway tell rapunzel, length 46\n23:12:23.460214 ARP, Reply hallway is-at 00:14:85:82:2a:2f (oui Unknown), length 28\n\nSo why does no other traffic get through?\nI ran an arping probe from both sides:\njos@hallway:~arping -b -D -w 2000 -I eth1 -s 192.168.124.101 192.168.124.104\nARPING 192.168.124.104 from 192.168.124.101 eth1\n^CSent 38 probes (38 broadcast(s))\nReceived 0 response(s)\n\nand something similar at the other end (only formatted differently, this is Raspbian after all).\n\nA: Probably a dumb question: Are these both directly connected into the router or are they going through a switch?  If through a switch, turn off both hosts, turn off switch, turn off router.  Turn on router, turn on switch, turn on hosts.\n(If you can give me more info on the exact brand of the switch, I might be able to tell you how to reset just the 3 ports of the switch)\nLeaving the above in as not everyone is using powerline adapters, but un-plug/replug the powerline adapters and/or update their firmware to \"unstick\" them…  >:)\n\nA: This turned out to be not as interesting as it first appeared. As Fabby mentioned, the powerline adapter must have got stuck. I connected one of the hosts to a different adapter and it worked straight away. Then I reconnected it to the first adapter, and again no traffic got through. While it would appear that the adapter has a hardware failure, keep in mind that it is only blocking traffic to and from one particular host.

This USB must be created on a PC however. Windows 7 or 8, it doesn't matter which one I use.  The link I mention above does say to use UNetbootin yet in the second paragraph, under requirements, there is a blurb that the resulting USB will only be usable on PCs.\nI'm a little new to the Linux community and I'm learning about EFI so my question is, is it a specific distro that would launch on both Windows and Macs as a live USB or what do i need to do to accomplish this task?\nBottom line is: I'm trying to help a co-worker recover files. I don't have a MAC myself nor access to one.  Virtual box with MAC software is also off the table.  Within my curriculum we are studying live boot USBs, so the challenge has been issued.\nI don't know whether EFI is an issue or not. What process do I take to create this USB? \n\nA: Just wanted to Post back with the answer to my own question.  \nIt is quite possible.\nShort answer: you need 2 things along with a windows OS installed on a comp.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rufus rufus.akeo.ie\n\n*EFI Bootable Linux like Ubuntu 14.0 or higher http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n\n*\n\n*Must be for 64 bit OS (amd64)\nChoose GPT for the partition Scheme and FAT32 for the file system, in Rufus and create. This will work for MAC or for windows 8 computers like Surface Pro 1-3 (when modifying their boot order). Silly easy.\n\n\n\nLong answer: a collection of information\nIt comes down to BIOS vs UEFI. (great link here https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Some_basics_of_MBR_v/s_GPT_and_BIOS_v/s_UEFI)\nBIOS, using MBR partitioning scheme, is obviously used on windows 7 and earlier pc's, along with some Linux OS's as well.\nGPT (GUID Partition Table), using UEFI which replaces BIOS, is used for MAC computers along with Windows 8 computers like Surface, Surface PRO, and others.\nAt the end of the day, the LIVE USB that was created worked on both Win8 and MAC computers as the partition scheme was the same.

The cfdisk program is quite easy to use.\n\nA: I suggest you use fdisk [device]. It's a dialogue-based command-line partition manager. If you type m as a command it will show you all available commands with a short description. To create an extended partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new partition.\n\n*Select extended partition type.\n\n*If multiple primary slots are free, select one (1–4).\n\n*Select the first and last sector. Since you want the whole remainder of the free space to be part of the new partition, the default values will do. To that purpose leave the dialogue responses empty.\n\n*Optionally print the resulting partition table before committing it to disk.\n\n*w the new partition table to disk and exit; or quit without saving.\n\n*Instruct the kernel to pick up the changes with partprobe [device] or reboot.\n\n\nA good advice before every change to a partition table is to create a backup, in case you make a mistake and need to restore the previous state. Create a backup on a different drive:\nsfdisk -d [device] > [backup file]\n\nTo restore use:\nsfdisk [device] < [backup file]\n\n", "Q: desktop launcher for ssh terminal I have 3 ssh terminals defined for 3 headless systems on my lan.

Basically I have 3-5 workspaces used, every time with same files - terminal open in particular folder, gedit with particular file and evince to see the result (I use latex). Here is the question - how to automatize process of opening files? What I would like is starting Ubuntu with gedit and evince opened on my work.\nFor some time KDE tried to open last saved programs, but it worked poorly - I got gedit and evince opened with blank files.\nI already saw some articles about devilspie (not my designated way, I want to get particular command, not just open firefox in workspace 2) and running commands at startup (seems better, but still I don't know how to tell terminal about workspaces).\n\nA: 1) Install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n2) Create a file with the following content and make it executable\n#!/bin/bash\nwmctrl -s 0 #Switches to workspace 0 [workspaces are numbered from 0]\ngnome-terminal & #Say you want a terminal in the 0th workspace\nnautilus & #Maybe a file browser too\nsleep 2 #Windows take some time to open. If you switch immediately, they'll open up in wrong workspaces. May have to change the value 2.\nwmctrl -s 1 #Switches to workspace 1\nfirefox & #You get the idea. Continue for all workspaces\nsleep 2\nwmctrl -s 0 #You will be left at this workspace when the script finishes executing\n\n3) Call this script from .xsessionrc in your home directory [if you may have to create this file] to automate the process at each login. Or you can just call it from a terminal when needed. EDIT: Put it in \"Startup Applications\", not .xsessionrc. .xsessionrc will execute even before the desktop environment has finished loading.\n\nYou may want to create a custom xsession so that you have two sessions to choose from, one which opens these applications automatically and one which doesn't. But that seems unnecessary to me.\n\nIf you feel that switching to a workspace, opening appropriate applications and then switching to the next is time consuming you can open all applications in one shot, and then move the windows using wmctrl. For example\nwmctrl -r 'Firefox' -t 1\n\nwill shift a window with Firefox in it's title to workspace 1. If more than one window exists, the first in the list of windows managed by wmctrl will be moved. You'll need to know the title of the windows that will be created by the applications to use this. That's why I didn't suggest this as the primary option. If titles will be unambiguous as is the case with most commonly used apps then this is the way to go.\n\nOpening applications in fullscreen:\nSome applications like gnome-terminal have command-line arguments to open a window in maximised state or in fullscreen mode. If such options exist use them. Otherwise use wmctrl as follows\nwmctrl -r 'username@machinename' -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\n\nThis maximises my (already existing) terminal window.\nwmctrl -r 'username@machinename' -b add,fullscreen\n\nThis sends the window to fullscreen mode.\n\nGo through wmctrl's man page. You may find use for more of its functionality.\nThis answer was taken from this source.\n\nA: I haven't been able to find a consistent way to open programs to a specific spot searching. There seems to be no direct way to tie a command to it's window. So I've written a small bash function that uses a combination of wmctrl and sleep to identify and position a window.\nThis function takes advantage of the fact that the last created window appears last in wmctrl's listings.  Because of the hacky nature of combining wmctrl and sleep to identify windows, I can't address this being used in a startup script.  I doubt it would work.\nThe function\nposition_program ()\n{\n    $1 &\n    sleep $2\n    window_id=`wmctrl -l | tail -n1 | cut -f1 -d \" \"`\n    wmctrl -ir $window_id  -e 0,$3\n    if [ ! -z \"$4\" ]; then\n        wmctrl -ir $window_id -t $4\n    fi\n}\n\nArgument 1 should be the command to execute, in quotes.\nArgument 2 is the amount of time to wait.  The script needs to know how long to wait between when a command is run, and when the window actually appears.\nArgument 3 is a geometry specification of x,y,height,width.  You can use the command \nxwininfo | grep geometry\n\nto help you get proper values for this. (run the command, click on the window with the desired geometry)\nArgument 4 is structured to be optional, and added in response to your question.  It takes an integer representing which desktop to move the window to.  The enumeration starts with 0, so your first desktop is 0, 2nd at 1, and so on\nExample\n#! /bin/dash\nposition_program ()\n{\n    $1 &\n    sleep $2\n    window_id=`wmctrl -l | tail -n1 | cut -f1 -d \" \"`\n    wmctrl -ir $window_id  -e 0,$3\n    if [ ! -z \"$4\" ]; then\n        wmctrl -ir $window_id -t $4\n    fi\n}\n\n# open gedit, position to the upper left corner, sized as 1000x1000\nposition_program  \"gedit --new-window my_text.txt\" 1 \"0,0,1000,1000\" 0\n\n#open another gedit window, same as before but on desktop 2\nposition_program  \"gedit --new-window my_othertext.txt\" 1 \"0,0,1000,1000\" 1\n\nThe amount of sleep can vary between different programs, obviously.  More interestingly, it can also vary if you the same program a second time, but for a new window.  So experimentation can sometimes be required.\nHopefully you can see how the script works, and maybe edit it or reuse the strategies as you need.  I've tested in on lubuntu and kubuntu, and it should work on other x based environments as well.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 + gnome-session-fallback : how do I lock the screen?

The server and the shares appear on both of the Macs, but my connection to the server is that of Guest, and although I've enabled Guest access, when I try to access one of the shares, I get a dialog \"The operation can't be completed because the original item for \"\" can't be found\".

After reboot I noticed that these paths are appeared twice. I tried to print call stacks and got the following:\n.zshenv sourced by\n18385:/bin/zsh /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession /usr/bin/startkde\n 2158:  -:0\n 1438:    kdm\n    1:      /sbin/init\n\n.zshenv sourced by\n22143:/bin/zsh\n20858:  /usr/bin/yakuake -session 10d5e3636b000141388223100000058160027_1415750006_832059\n18385:    upstart --user\n 2158:      -:0\n 1438:        kdm\n    1:          /sbin/init\n\nSo, the second one is ok, as it was caused by opening yakuake, where I was checking $PATH variable. But the first call is not clear for me. Why does /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession try to load user's configuration? What is the reason and what is the best way to avoid $PATH duplication?\nPlease don't suggest workarounds like wrapping the contents of .zshenv into checks for first run (aka include guards)\n\nA: Although /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession actually is used to load some of the user's shell configurations, it actually does not load ~/.zshenv explicitly (although a comment mentions that it is loaded). ~/.zshenv (as well as /etc/zshenv) are loaded automatically everytime a zsh starts up, this cannot be overridden. And as /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession is run with your login shell - in your case zsh - ~/.zshenv is loaded, too, no matter what actually is done in /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession.\nAnd /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsession tries to load the user's configuration so that it is available to programs that are started via means other than command line shell (KDE menu, autostart, desktop icon, etc.).\n\nAs for preventing $PATH duplication this should do the trick: Instead of using something like PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/my/path/here:/another/path, use\nnew_paths=(/usr/local/bin /my/path/here /another/path)\npath=($path ${new_path:|path})\n\nnew_path is an array of the paths you want to add. path is the array version of PATH, it has the same content but as actual array instead of colon-separated list. ${new_path:|path} is substituted by an array of the elements in new_path that are not already in path.\n", "Q: Sound not working 12.04 after update my sound was working perfectly fine while suddenly it stopped after an update...

So, on a whim I reinstalled Ubuntu from the latest version (14.10). I originally had 14.04 LTS. Nothing I did could get this to work (even reinstalling 14.04). So I downloaded the lastest release and did a clean install. And it looks as if the Devs fixed the issue in this latest release because now when I enable the option in Onboard settings, I get the keyboard pop up for logging in and from the lock screen. Hope this helps.\nAn additional note. When you enable the lock screen option you get prompted to enable Accessibility features. This is the key for log in screen. Onboard doesn't automatically pop up at login. But in the task bar, you'll see the little Accessibility icon (a little man figure in a circle). Touch that and you get the option to show the keyboard.

So, how do I install it?\n\nA: First things first, note this very noticeable warning:\n------------------------------------------------------\nYou are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX. If you encounter problems, please retest in a\nclean 32-bit WINEPREFIX before reporting a bug.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis indicates you need to create a 32bit Wineprefix, as Wine works better with 32bit stuff - this can be done simply by running telling wine what architecture to use before running its commands (this can I think can also be done by uninstalling Wine x86_64 and installing Wine i386/i686 - anyway, keep the terminal open for the other wine commands after running this):\nexport WINEARCH=\"win32\"\n\nThis sets the environment variables wine reads before it launches (see man wine).\nIt would also be a good idea to get it to create it's own WINEPREFIX (where the Wine virtual drive is stored). By default this is ~/.wine, but you can create individual ones for each architecture & program - so to create a WINEPREFIX in directory /home/USERNAME/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/:\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/\n\nThe directory doesn't have to exist (ideally it shouldn't exist so stuff doesn't have to be overwritten), but the parent directories probably should - you should also have permission to read & write to it, and I don't think the wineprefix can be on a FAT/NTFS drive for technical reasons (it won't work).\nSo to setup a 32bit wine prefix for a program:\nexport WINEARCH=\"win32\"\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/\nwineboot -u\n\nYou can replace PROGRAM-NAME with the name of the program to make it easier to identify the program later. Just make sure it only includes the letter and numbers as punctuation often has a special function in various command shells.\nYou should then get a window like this:\n\nThen you are ready to go. Now you can install NET 4.0 using winetricks (you might want to get the latest version from here first):\nwinetricks dotnet40\n\nThis should be in the terminal after the export WINEPREFIX=... command, or by placing it just before the wine command as so (useful for app launchers that one command line):\nenv WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/\" winetricks dotnet40\n\nYou may also want to use winetricks to install some other stuff it might need - e.g. fonts (using the options corefonts,lucida,tahoma). To list winetricks' options, use winetricks list-all.\nYou can then install the program using wine \"~/Downloads/PATH/TO/INSTALLER.exe\". Yet again (copy the file, then 'Paste Filenames' into terminal, so it looks like '/home/wilf/Desktop/name spaces/installer.exe' not file:///home/wilf/Desktop/name spaces/installer.exe').\nYou should make sure the WINEPREFIX has been exported before running this command (especially if you closed the terminal), or in the same line. After getting it to work (or not work) you might want to do a report on how well it works here (including what you did etc so you can help other people). If you have issues, and noticeable errors appear in the output you can report a bug.\nOnce installed, it should make the launcher of the app appear on the Dash/Menu and sometimes on the Desktop. Otherwise in future to run the app you may need to run the app with the export WINEPREFIX=... and wine .... (or env WINEPREFIX=... wine .....) again, unless you create a launcher (comment below or somewhere if you need to know how to do so....)\n\nMore info, troubleshooting etc\nHow do I install winetricks?\nYou can a version from the Ubuntu repositories using this command (or installing Winetricks from the Software Center):\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nYou can then use winetricks OPTIONS to do stuff.\nFor the latest version, you can use these commands to download and use the latest version:\nwget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks\nchmod +x winetricks \n\nNote you will have to run it as ./winetricks <OPTIONS>, unless it's directory is in the shell's $PATH.\nI don't want to use terminal, what can I do?\nThe app you want to use may be runnable under PlayOnLinux (it should be if you can find it here) - this is pretty much all GUI and automatically does most of the steps for you.\nOtherwise, you can use the terminal to do it very easily (you usually have much more control than if a GUI program is doing it), just be careful what you put in (especially if it includes the commands sudo, rm, etc). Try to understand what is going on with each command first.\nAlso, some of these steps can be done in other ways - both winecfg and winetricks open GUIs through which you can do some steps, but again what you can do is limited.\nHow do I install the latest Wine version?\nThe newer wine versions are more up to date, so may be able to run the program better (unless there is a regression which impacts it). To install the current latest version (Wine1.7) you can use the offical Wine PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.7\n\nIf it can't find the package wine1.7, try running the install command again but with wine instead of wine1.7\nFor installing and configuring Wine generally, you can also try this question.\nThe program I want to use is designed for a newer version of Windows, what can I do?\nWine by default replicates Windows XP, which some programs don't support as it is EOL (which I supposes in handy as you probably can run programs for WinXP under Wine under Linux, and you can 'nuke WinXP from orbit' :)\nAnyway, first open up the Wine configuration window:\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/\nwinecfg\n\nWhere ~/.wine-PROGRAM-NAME/ is the WINEPREFIX you created earlier.\nAnd select the Windows version to replicate at the bottom of the 'Applications' tab. Then try installing the app again.\nWINDOWS VIRUSES UNDER WINE?!?!\nQuite possibly.

If you have an uncommon compiler, you may need set the value 'errorformat' yourself to get something that works well for you. Finding the value of 'errorformat' for an unsupported compiler is not straightforward, but it's not hard--it just takes some fiddling and experimentation.\nThe :make command does not use ccfilter by default. The error message you're seeing suggests that one of your configuration files is telling Vim to use ccfilter. The ccfilter man page, found in $VIMFILES/tools/ccfilter.1 in distributions that include it, suggests using ccfilter as follows.\n:set shellpipe=\\|&ccfilter\\>\n\nSo, when you see that error message, you could execute\n:verbose set shellpipe?\n\nwhich will show you where 'shellpipe' was last set. Edit that file and remove that line. There may be a line like the following nearby.\n:set errorformat=%f:%l:%c:%t:%m\n\nRemove that line, too, so that Vim can use its default 'errorformat'.\nThat should fix the problem.\nYou can find out more about using :make here.\n:help 30.1\n:help :make\n:help compiler-select\n:help errorformats\n\n", "Q: How do I install HP P1102W printer driver Trying to install drivers for a HP P1100W on Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe printer was recognized as soon as I hooked it up.

Very excited to get using Linux.  I'm a low level IT support tech and am used to windows, and never considered Linux just because there wasn't any reason to do so.\nPicked up a free Lattitude E6500 with 4GB RAM, slapped a 256GB Crucial MX100 SSD in it, and installed windows 10 tech preview.  Realized this would be a great time to try out linux as well, since this laptop is going to be my testbed, and Ubuntu seemed to be the way to go.\nAnyway, just wanted to give some background so you all know I have zero knowledge of this OS. :)\nNow the question:\nI've researched a bit on how to get Ubuntu installed, but am still a little confused as to how to do so properly with my current setup.  I shrunk my win10 partition to 100GB, leaving the remaining 130-140GB as a simple volume (RAW).\nI put the CD in, rebooted, and started the process.  However, it doesn't detect a current OS, so I go to 'Something else' option.\nFrom there I learned from a youtube video to select the blank partition (free space) added the following:\nroot partition - 25GB\nswap partition - 8GB\nThis was my second go around, as I only selected 1GB for the swap file last time.\nAlso, last time, I also created a boot partition (also, the size of the entire partition was smaller, as was the root partition).\nThis time, When it was done installing, I got a boot error and was stuck at the grub recovery screen.  I put the CD back in and rebooted, and this time I got an option to install Ubuntu over the existing one.\nInstallation went fine, but now I have no Win10 to boot into. :)\nWhen I look at the disk size in the Ubuntu OS, it shows 231GB free and 4.1GB used.  It appears to have just done a full install, overwriting the entire drive.\nNo biggie, and I'm glad it did, in a way, as I'm guessing I'll learn a lot from this!\nPlease let me know what I did wrong, and if you need any more info.\nThanks!\n\nA: This sentence has all answers:\n\nThis time, When it was done installing, I got a boot error and was\n  stuck at the grub recovery screen. I put the CD back in and rebooted,\n  and this time I got an option to install Ubuntu over the existing\n  one.\n\nInstalling over existing once erased Windows and installed Ubuntu over your laptop.\nSame happened to me and I am windows free since April 2014. :)\n", "Q: Connected to wifi but no internet access I am using wpa_supplicant to manually connect to wifi after deleting network-manager on Ubuntu 14.04.\nNow that I've finally managed to connect, I can't access any pages on the internet and I can't ping anything either. This wifi and my network adapter (usb wireless dlink) work perfectly since I was using that setup 2 days ago before removing network-manager.\nI know its an improvement because just yesterday Ubuntu took 2-3 minutes to boot because it told me it couldn't find network settings until it timed out eventually. Now it boots normally so it does see it and I feel I'm a few commands away.\nHere's the setup : \n\nNow the iwconfig before connecting to the wifi manually\n\nand the iwconfig after connecting manually  (Chouchoune is my home network)\n\nlshw -C network:\n\nroute -n; cat /etc/resolv.conf; ping -c4 4.2.2.2; cat /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\nA: By looking at my last input I realised that even though I was connected it couldn't resolve the name servers.

Try going onto bios setup (it says it when you boot, E.G. F2) Go into that HDD and make sure it says 'on'. Make sure to have GParted installed first, then open GParted and go into the Broken HDD and click 'Add Partition' It's up to you what file system you want to do.

At first I thought it was the microphone but I tested it with and without qjackctl hooked up and with just my voice it sounds fine. The problem I am experiencing is when I am playing on my MIDI keyboard and using zynaddsubfx.It seems like the problem is minor when just using zynaddsubfx and is exacerbated when I turn on Audacity. \nTo fix it I tried:\nvi /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nThen I typed these commands:\nload-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0 tsched=0\nload-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0\nload-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0\n\nThen, after restarting the computer I changed the microphone options, more were available.\n\nA: It turns out I was right, it had to do with qjackctl. These were the settings I had with crackling sounds and white noise:\n\n\nAnd these are the correct settings that completely cleared up the problem:\n\n\nI found the answer to my question when I saw a comment that yoshimi was quieter. But after watching this youtube video I decided to try and do the settings differently in zynaddsubfx and see if it made a difference. \n", "Q: Icecast on linux using AAC I'm pretty new to using Icecast. We are streaming MP3s from a Linux box with Icecast, but we need to move to AAC. How can I make Icecast stream AAC files?\n\nA: Iceacast doe not natively support AAC:\n\nIcecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg (Vorbis and Theora), Opus, WebM and MP3 audio streams.Icecast\n\nTo overcome this we may want to have a look at darkice  which claims to be capable to convert and send AAC-streams (amongst others) to Icecast.\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I setup an Icecast server for broadcasting audio in my network?\n\n*Manpage for darkice.cfg\n\nA: Icecast does not officially support AAC, but if you send it an AAC or MP3 stream it will usually work. We don't support it officially due to patent concerns. For this reason we pass unsupported streams through without any handling.\nThe challenge is to find a good AAC encoder. FAAC works but is rather mediocre. You can probably buy commercial codecs, they would also address the next concern.\nAAC is heaviliy patented and you might need to purchase licenses for it, both for encoding and streaming. IANAL, I don't know. Just pointing it out as to be checked.\nThat all said, there are probably a few source clients that would support AAC (if compiled from source, etc). I can name libav (avconv), VLC and liquidsoap in addition to the already mentioned darkice.\n", "Q: How do you uninstall manually installed Eclipse?

Will they be managed automatically or do I need to modify any system settings? \nHow do I have to modify ubuntu thus the system can run from a usb device with write protection switch enabled? \n\nA: If it's a full install, it won't work (write failure).\nIf it's the install-USB (live CD on USB), then no problem. It was designed that way. All changes are made in ram.\n\nA: There are a lot of files which get written on the root filesystem you will have to track down:\nsudo find / -newer <some file from yesterday> -print\n\nThen figure out which need to be replaced links to a file in /tmp, which you can set up in /tmp from a script you run from /etc/rc.local.  Of course, you have the known directories like /tmp and /var/log which you can put into a ramdisk mounted from /etc/ftab, So if you want to do some work, it should be possible.  Much easier to have a live media which you can select at boot time to have or not have persistence.\n", "Q: Error finding preseed file when booting the UbuntuServer installer via iPXE through HTTP I know the typical settings to run a PXE server is the combination DHCP+TFTP+HTTP/FTP/NFS... servers, but my setting must be only DHCP+HTTP, so my dhcpd.conf has these lines:\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n    range 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.10;\n    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n    ...\n    filename \"http://192.168.1.1/pxelinux.0\";\n}\n\nI use iPXE (http://www.ipxe.org) -which can get pxelinux.0 from a HTTP server- to boot my clients.

What can I do to tell the installer to forget using the url from dhcpd.conf as a preseed file's url?\n\nA: I can see two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the APPEND line so that it uses static IP settings instead of going out looking for DHCP. This way it should never see the DHCP filename.\n\n*Change your DHCP server configuration so that it serves the filename only to requests not from a Debian installer. The example given in the Installation guide can be easily adapted:\n# your normal settings\nif substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 3) != \"d-i\" {\n    filename \"http://192.168.1.1/pxelinux.0\";\n}\n\n", "Q: Lower Minimum Screen Brightness By using /sys/class/backlight/ the screen brightness can go lower than when using the function keys to do so.\nIs there a way to change the minimum level used by the function key method, rather than having to manually write to the file each time?\n\nA: you can use xbacklight and set a custom shortcut using your brightness down key to use xbacklight.\nYou can do that as follows\nrun the following command in your terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nUnder system settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> custom shortcuts add the following custom shortcut.\nxbacklight -[percentage]\n\nReplacing [percentage] with a number.

The way that apt-get works is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*when you do apt-get install , it will automatically resolves all dependencies and install all extra packages that are necessary to install .\n\n*however, when you remove , all of the automatically installed dependent packages are left on the system, which is what you see above. apt-get \"knows\" that these were installed due to autoresolve, which is why it tells you that you can free up space. But it does not do it automatically, because if you are a software developer you might have used some of them in your development. Or if you installed something manually (e.g., from a tarball or something) not using apt-get, some of these might still be necessary, but apt-get does not know about it.\n\n*if you have not done any of the above, then apt-get autoremove should be safe. Of course, as with any software, things might go south, but at least I have not had problems with autoremove in my experience. It would be interesting to know what was the \"catastrophe\" that you experienced the previous time.\nBTW, in the future you might want to use \"apt-get autoremove \" instead of \"apt-get remove \" as it should automatically remove the package and its dependencies.\n", "Q: Which Juju's OpenStack Charms am I using (Community or Canonical)? To give you better idea, let me just give you a little context\n\n\n*\n\n*I had a MAAS setup with 6 nodes in ready state.\n\n*One of my node became Juju bootstrap node.\n\n*After that I deployed OpenStack Juju charms by following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure.\n\n*I can successfully log into dashboard.\n\n\nQuestion: I am confused about the distribution of OpenStack which was deployed by following above steps. I am not sure about Whether its Community distribution or is it recently released \"Canonical Distribution\"?\n\nA: Ubuntu OpenStack: the Canonical distribution deploys OpenStack in Canonical's reference architecture. The mechanism through which you install OpenStack uses Landscape to talk to MAAS and Juju and deploy the charms in that architecture. You get added benefit from Landscape doing the work because it helps you monitor your OpenStack setup after it's installed.\nBy following the instructions on the help site, you've got an OpenStack install, but it's in the architecture that you've defined.\nIn short: you don't have the Canonical distribution.\n\nA: Juju charms for OpenStack deployment by default use the packages available in the distribution, for instance if you deploy trusty then you're getting Icehouse packages being pulled from the Ubuntu archive.\nThe \"Canonical Distribution\" is based on the same packages, but is deployed in a standard reference architecture by Landscape automation, and is a brand associated with using Ubuntu technologies within Canonical's best practices.\nBest,\n", "Q: keeping audio visualizations on in vlc Every time I select an audio visualization in vlc for audio files, it is forgotten after restarting vlc and no visualization is shown.\nIs there a way to keep audio visualizations on in vlc?\n\nA: Is it possible that VLC is for some reason ignoring the config file or recreating it?\nWhat I'm finding is that the config file is setup per user and the below location would be where one could find the file.

I see that kernel 3.14.1 is available for Trusty at\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nWhen will this kernel be available for upgrade via the Ubuntu repositories.\n(I know that I can manually download and upgrade the kernel, but I'd rather get it as an update).\n\nA: It never will. New kernels arrive at repositories of LTS versions when point releases come out. This is part of the Hardware Enablement Stack.\nAccording to the 14.04.x Ubuntu Kernel Support Schedule, kernel 3.16 (from Ubuntu 14.10) will be available in Ubuntu 14.04.2 (due in Feb, 2015). But you don't have to reinstall your system, once 14.04.2 is out (and probably a few days before) just run the following to install kernel 3.16:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\n\nA: You can already get it by installing the following...\nlinux-generic-lts-utopic\nlinux-image-lts-utopic\nlinux-headers-lts-utopic\n\nJust remove linux-generic, linux-image-generic, and linux-headers-generic first.  You don't need a PPA.\n\nA: Just to add to @eric-carvalho answer:\nIf you don't want to wait to run Utopic kernel until Feb 2015, you can add the Canonical Team PPA. But this is the PPA description: \nThis ppa is used for building pre-release and test kernels.\nIt IS NOT RECOMMENDED that you subscribe to this PPA.\nIf you're ok with that, add the PPA and install utopic kernel:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:canonical-kernel-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\n\nA: The image at Kernel/LTSEnablementStack - Ubuntu Kernel Support section shows that the 3.16 kernel will come out first, along with 14.10, as an \"Early Preview\" from the \"-updates pocket\", i.e. the \"recommended\", non-security-related updates.  And in fact it is already there, currently as linux-image-3.16.0-29-generic though of course you'll want to install the generic package linux-image-generic-lts-utopic to keep up with updates to it.\nEric notes that 14.04.2 comes out in February.  Perhaps then the new kernel will be in another pocket, whatever that is....  Unfortunately I don't see any actual text at ubuntu.com which explains the \"early preview\" option any more, or uses the term \"pocket\" in this context.

I tried some solutions, such as killing processes and updating to the latest aircrack, but I still receive an error.\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: you don't need to use airmon-ng at all. you can simply:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\n\nthan go on with\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor\n\nand finally\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nthats basically what airmon-ng does. \n\nA: You need to read more about how to use aircrack-ng.\nThe command you executed, sudo airodump-ng mon0, tells your computer to start capturing packets on the interface called mon0, but you don't have that interface yet, that's why it tells you No such device.\nThe general steps in using aircrack-ng is:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo airmon-ng start wlan0\n\n\n*\n\n*This puts your wireless interface into monitor mode, which is the mode where you can capture all packets, even if they weren't directed to your computer. What the command actually does is it creates another interface called mon0, which you can see when you do iwconfig. This is the command that you probably didn't execute. If you did run it but you can't see mon0 afterwards, let us know what was the command's output.\n\n\n*sudo airodump-ng <options> mon0\n\n\n*\n\n*This starts capturing packets.\n\n\n*sudo aireplay-ng <options> mon0\n\n\n*\n\n*You use this to attempt to increase the number of IVs being captured so you can easily crack the password.\n\n\n*sudo aircrack-ng <options> <file>\n\n\n*\n\n*This is the application that then cracks the capture you took to extract the password.\n\n\n\nA: The problem is with the name of the interface. Use the following commands:\nStart your wireless interface in monitoring mode\nairmon-ng   \n\nKill all the interfering processes\nairmon-ng check kill     \n\nInstead of airodump-ng mon0, type this airodump-ng wlan0mon \nPlease let me know if this works for you.\n\nA: From what i've seen, in the latest ubuntu version (15.10) there is a problem when enabling monitor mode on mon0.\nTo do it clean and clear, use this command to kill any process that can cause problems sudo airmon-ng check kill , then use this command to enable monitor mode on mon0 sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 .\nNow you can use mon0 with other *-ng commands.\n\nA: Okay, first of all let's start with killing all processes with sudo airmon-ng check kill , then enabling monitor mode with sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 , now the answer to your question is in the output of this command. Notice that it says in the bottom (experimental wl monitor mode vif enabled for [phy0]wlan0 on [phy0]prism0) for me it says prism0 this is the interface that was created for me when I used the airmon-ng start wlan0 command which is in general called mon0 but it's not always the same so you need to check the name of the one that was created for you and use it in the next command. For example in my case, to start capturing packets I will type airodump-ng prism0 not mon0. I hope this answers your question.\n\nA: if airodump-ng mon0 doesnt works for you;\ngive the previous one command as; \"airmon-ng start wlp3s0\" rather than \"airmon-ng start wlan0\" because wlan0 works for network on lan and wlp3s0 works for wireless network and then insert command \"airodump-ng mon0\"\nthis will surely work for you too\n", "Q: Something weird is happening with Fn keys I have an Asus N56JR with NVIDIA GeForce 760M.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nThere are a few things wrong with my Fn keys. For one the brightness (controlled with Fn+F5 and Fn+F6) do not respond at all. Even commands in the terminal and programs that i have installed do not affect the screen brightness.\nThe second problem that I have is that the keyboard back-light (controlled with Fn+F3 and Fn+F4) do not seem to follow a regular outcome. The keyboard brightness up key sometimes decreases the light and other times increases it. This is seemingly random. The same happens with eh keyboard brightness down button. Along with those two buttons, there is a button in the top left of the keyboard that matches that power button. This is a button used to configure anything to. Just a blank button usually. I created a custom shortcut to launch an application from it (it works fine) but sometimes it gets mixed up with the keyboard brightness keys. These 3 keys seem to switch with each other at random intervals.\n\nA: [For your FN-Brightness Key]\nOpen your Terminal and run this:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nand search for \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nand change it into\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\nIt should work for Asus as for Acer PCs too. It worked for my Acer.\n\nA: On my Asus k55v, brightness & rfkill (wifi on/off) where not working when I install Debian. As *buntu derives from Debian, you can try adding \"acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\" to your kernel command line modifying the file /etc/default/grub at line GRUB_CMD_LINE_DEFAULT=.\nIt should see like\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi='!Windows 2012'\"\n\nThen execute, as root, update-grub. Reboot and it should be done. Maybe, then, you need to reassign these keys (fn+f5 and f6) to system's brightness actions on your keyboard settings, at hotkeys section.\nThat worked for me, and I have all fn keys working on my system (asus k55v laptop, as I've said). even fn+f4 (not marked, launches www browser).\n", "Q: Apache2 - AH00112: Warning: DocumentRoot does not exist I followed this guide to setup two virtual hosts under Apache.\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts\nWhen restarting the Apache service I get the following warnings.

With one click an app will be installed, it is very easy, no terminal required at all. But I recommend learning the terminal too. Actually at the beginning I hated it. But once you get familiar with it, it will be your friend. Get the book LinuxFund from here http://linux-training.be/downloads/\n\nA: Ubuntu is a Linux distribution putting great effort in providing exactly what you asked for.\nThe main philosophy behind the Unity desktop environment is to provide a user experience making usage of the OS possible without deeper knowledge of computional science, and without the need to use a command line or a configuration file editor to get around with our daily tasks.\nFrom my own experience with my children and with my elderly parents this goal is achieved to the best. Both, my kids, and my parents do not even know how to open the terminal but they are happily using Ubuntu for e-mail, internet acess, graphics editing, listening to music or video, gaming, and more.\nConfiguring the system is done by graphical tools from the System Settings menu. Adding new software can easily be done using the Ubuntu Software Center, and even deeper configuration tasks can be made with the graphical dconf-editor (also read \"How can I configure Unity?\" for more options).\nHaving said this, of course there are use cases where just typing a single-line terminal command will do the same, and there are still special cases where we do not have a graphical frontend for some applications that only run from the command line. That is why support channels often just recommend a terminal command which usually works identical between distributions and Ubuntu versions, and which is easy to post in a support request.\nBut this is nothing we should have to be doing regularly. It is the exception we may hopefully not need when something on your system was broken. In this case somebody with a deeper knowledge of the OS, or a help channel such as Ask Ubuntu will provide you with the necessary commands you need. This is not much different to any other OS, only that help and support from the Ubuntu commmunity is usually very fast, globally accessible 7/24, and it is free.\n\nA: It took me a long time to completely migrate from Windows to Linux.... Unfortunately Linux is not as mature as Windows with regards to GUI implementation. I suppose thats the difference between open source and proprietary. However, for day to day tasks like web browsing, emailing, watching movies and writing documents it is every bit as good. I, for one, am a convert. I dived in and started using the command line where ever possible and have not looked back since. I would strongly recommend you build a test machine from some old hardware you might have, or setup a virtual machine, and start to play with the command line. It is surprising how quickly your knowledge will grow.\n", "Q: \"Installing Ubuntu OpenStack: The Canonical distribution\" failed due to bootstrap timeout I am following the \"Installing Ubuntu OpenStack: The canonical distribution\" guide to deploy Canonical Openstack.

I'm using Ubuntu 1410 (Kernel v3.13)\n#uname -r\n3.13.0-27-generic\n\nI've been trying to disable the APU (i.e. Intel's graphics software driver) and use the GPU (i.e. Xorg open source driver for Radeon) instead. But I failed.\nFrom all the links I visited I only found out that the GPU has been disabled (i.e. DynOff)\n#sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n[sudo] password for mgelbana: \n0:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0\n1:DIS: :DynOff:0000:01:00.0\n\nDIS: Discrete graphics card\nIGD: Integrated graphics card\nI've also enabled radeon's dynamic power management (DPM) in the kernel parameters (i.e. radeon.dpm=1)\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"drm.debug=0xe plymouth:debug radeon.dpm=1\"\n\nTo know which driver is currently working, I open Ubuntu's Settings > Details and check the following information in the Overview section:\nGraphics: Intel® Ivybridge Mobile\n\nSo how can I enable the open source Radeon driver ?\n\nA: I only found a way to activate it dynamically when needed; this answer is a rewording/restructuring of my two previous answers here and here --- these were more oriented on the temperature sensors on the ATI card so I think it's worthwhile to post this answer here. \nIn recent (3.13+) kernel the discrete driver is normally disabled: \n[:~/Pictures/2014] 1 % sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n0:DIS: :DynOff:0000:01:00.0\n1:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0\n\n...but ready to start when needed.

Problem is that you can't boot Ubuntu anymore after that, but you can fix this using boot repair. \nUbuntu and many other Linux distributions use the GRUB2 boot loader. If GRUB2 breaks — for example, if you install Windows after installing Ubuntu or overwrite your MBR — you won’t be able to boot into Ubuntu.\nYou can easily restore GRUB2 from a Ubuntu live CD or USB drive. This process is different from restoring the legacy GRUB boot loader on older Linux distributions.\nGraphical Method – Boot Repair\nBoot Repair is a graphical tool that can repair GRUB2 with a single click. This is the ideal solution to boot problems for most users.\nIf you have the media you installed Ubuntu from, insert it into your computer and restart. If you don’t, download a Ubuntu live CD and burn it to a disc or install it on a USB flash drive. You can also download a dedicated Boot Repair live CD.\nAfter booting into the live Ubuntu environment, open a terminal from the Dash and run the following commands to install Boot Repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nThe Boot Repair window will appear after you run the boot-repair command. After it scans your system, click the Recommended repair button to repair GRUB2 with a single click.\n\nThe Boot Repair window will appear after you run the boot-repair command. After it scans your system, click the Recommended repair button to repair GRUB2 with a single click.\n\nYou can also click the Advanced options header to customize GRUB2’s options without learning its command-line syntax.\n\nRestart your computer after using the Boot Repair tool. Ubuntu should boot up normally.\nSource:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\n", "Q: Firefox randomly not reacting sometimes on my Ubuntu 14.10 machine Firefox 33 hangs. This means that although performing clicks or keyboard shortcuts the window content doesn't change. When I resize the window, everything is fine again, until the next \"hang\".\nDo you have an idea how to solve this problem?\n\nA: Many \"Firefox\" problems are caused by problematic themes, extensions, or plugins. To quickly check for these potential causes, follow the steps in the Standard diagnostic - Firefox article. The Mozi kb article link give below will give you the detailed information of various Firefox hangs and its fix.  \nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_hangs\nNote: Me faced similar issues with scrips in google drive not responding or due to Adobe flash player either hangs or crashes in Firefox.\n", "Q: black screen & restarts after upgrade to 14.10 I recently upgraded my netbook (Lenovo S205) from 14.04 to 14.10. After the restart, it just restarts over and over. I see the boot menu where I can press F2 to get into BIOS and F12 to choose the start medium. Shortly after that it restarts. That's roughly one restart every five seconds or so. I tried starting from a live usb stick, but when I start from the usb stick it only says \"secure boot not enabled\" and then the screen stays black. In BIOS, there is no option that has anything to do with secure booting.\nEDIT: By pressing some buttons (unfortunately I don't know which) I made it into boot-repair. However, after I let it repair everything and I restart, it's the same as before. Here is my log.\n\nA: I finally did it.\nThe magical key that was necessary to boot from a usb stick was the right arrow key. I don't know why, but only by pressing that key the usb stick finally booted.\nSomehow my partition table was changed to uefi mode. My laptop tried booting in uefi mode but I don't have that so that's why it restarted over and over.\nI changed my partition table back to \"msdos\" and reinstalled Ubuntu (actually Mint). Now it works again. In grub I still have some efi.signed entries and when I choose these I get a kernel panic and nothing happens. I have to navigate to \"previous linux installs\" in grub and choose the not efi signed entry and then everything starts up.\n", "Q: Firefox problem at showing some characters - ubuntu 14.10 My problem is what the title says.

If nothing is listed then you will need to create one. The following command will create a 4gb swap, as an approximate rule the size of your swap should be the same size as the amount of RAM your machine has:\nsudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile\n\n(obviously replace 4G with 8G if you have 8gb of RAM etc.!)\nVerify that the swap size is correct with:\nls -lh /swapfile\n\nNext set the permissions on the swap file so it's only accessible by root:\nsudo chmod 600 /swapfile\n\nNext set the swap file up using:\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n\nFinally use the following command to enable the swap:\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n\nYou can check that swap is now in use by typing:\nsudo swapon -s\n\nCongrats, you should now have swap. Next you might want to...\nMake swap automatically load at startup:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nAnd then add the following line to the bottom of the file:\n/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0\n\nFor more information, such as optimizing swap, this article has a great overview.\n\nA: Many OS' allow the option for dynamic paging files, which grow and shrink depending on need. Most linuxes, including ubuntu, do not, I think, allow this option by default.\nI use the fantastic program swapspace for managing dynamic paging files, available with more information from here: http://pqxx.org/development/swapspace/ I generally find this is the simplest way of managing swap on ubuntu.\n", "Q: User processes continue to run after logout I have put the following code in my .profile\nps cax | grep jackd > /dev/null\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Jack is aready running.\"\nfi\n\nif [ \"$SESSION_TYPE\" != \"remote/ssh\" ] && [ \"$DISPLAY\" ]; then\n    ps cax | grep jackd > /dev/null\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Jack is aready running.\"\n    else\n        jackd --sync -P80 -p128 -dalsa -dhw:UA25 -r48000 -p64 -n3 -Xraw &\n        jack_wait -w\n        alsaj &\n        ~/deployed/syzmo/x86_64-GNU%2fLinux/syzmo_client_studio &\n    fi\nfi\n\nWhen I logout from KDE and log in on tty1, I see the message \"Jack is already running\".

Is there any way to log it properly so that I know how does system react to each signal? Here is the C code I use, any feedback on that would be also appreciated:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    int sigs[64] = { 0 };\n    for(int i = 0; i < 64; i++) sigs[i] = i+1;\n    char sigs_char[64][2];\n    for(int i = 0; i < 64; i++) sprintf(sigs_char[i], \"%d\", sigs[i]);\n\n    char one[2] = \" 1\";\n\n    char commands[64][128];\n    for(int i = 0; i < 64; i++){\n        strcpy(commands[i], \"sudo kill -s \");\n        strncat(commands[i], sigs_char[i], 2);\n        strcat(commands[i], one);\n    }\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < 64; i++){\n        printf(\"Sending signal number %d\\n\", i);\n        system(commands[i]);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: I'm afraid there's no general way to \"log\" init's reaction. First, there's the fact that kill won't deliver any signals to init that init isn't handling (from man 2 kill):\nNOTES\n       The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1,  the  init  process,\n       are  those  for  which  init  has explicitly installed signal handlers.\n       This is done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.\n\nSo, for many signals, there won't be a reaction at all. Now that leaves the signals that are handled. Using this Unix & Linux question, we can determine those1:\n$ HANDLED_SIGS=$(awk '/SigCgt/{print \"0x\"$2}' /proc/1/status)\n$ for i in {0..31}; do (( (1 << i) & $HANDLED_SIGS )) && echo $((++i)) $(/bin/kill --list=$i); done | column\n1 HUP   6 ABRT  11 SEGV 15 TERM 30 PWR\n2 INT   10 USR1 14 ALRM 17 CHLD 32\n\nOf these:\n\n\n*\n\n*SIGABRT and SIGSEGV caused core dumps and kernel panics. Nothing to be detected here.\n\n*SIGTERM caused it to reload, with log messages in /var/log/syslog:\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.384907] init: upstart-udev-bridge main process (395) terminated with status 1\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.384916] init: upstart-udev-bridge main process ended, respawning\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.384990] init: upstart-socket-bridge main process (649) terminated with status 1\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.384995] init: upstart-socket-bridge main process ended, respawning\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.385059] init: upstart-file-bridge main process (953) terminated with status 1\nNov 14 00:25:13 vm kernel: [32383.385074] init: upstart-file-bridge main process ended, respawning\n\n\n*SIGINT caused it to start a reboot, and SIGPWR started a shutdown. Both looked like normal ones (say, like if you did a reboot, for example).\n\n*None of the others caused any visible effects. (Though, considering init's duties, we can guess what SIGCHLD does.)\n\n\nAnd all this is for Upstart. Who knows how SysV or systemd will react?\nSo, all in all, you're not going to have much luck with empirical methods here. Use the Source, Luke.\n\n1That convoluted bit of code is for getting the signals that init is willing to catch:\nHANDLED_SIGS=$(awk '/SigCgt/{print \"0x\"$2}' /proc/1/status)\nfor i in {0..31} \ndo \n    (( (1 << i) & $HANDLED_SIGS )) && echo $((++i)) $(/bin/kill --list=$i); \ndone | column\n\n\n\n*\n\n*HANDLED_SIGS=$(awk '/SigCgt/{print \"0x\"$2}' /proc/1/status): /proc/$PID/status contains a wealth of information about the process, including the set of handled signals. This set is given by SigCgt, a bitmask given as a hexadecimal number. We use awk to extract that number and add 0x as a prefix.\n\n*(( (1 << i) & $HANDLED_SIGS )): check if signal no. (i+1) is masked. Since we're concerned about the ith bit, we use 2(i-1) (which is 1 << i). With (( )), a non-zero value indicates success.\n\n", "Q: Creating interactive prototypes in Ubuntu I will be working on Ubuntu as a UX designer and was wondering if any other UXer in the same situation can recommend software to produce fairly advanced interactive prototypes.

My workstation's ip is 10.x.x.x and I can ssh the Maas server. The Maas server in turn is also ssh connect to the VM's. Because the workstation and VM's are on a different network I can't connect to the VM's directly.\nI tried reverse SSH tunneling with,\nssh -R 6333:localhost:22 akh@192.168.x.x \n\nfrom one of the VM's to the Maas server. Afterwards I tried to connect from my workstation to the VM using,\nssh akh@192.168.x.x -p 6333\n\nBut I repeatedly get this error, 'Permission denied (publickey).'\nI have already copied my public key to in the VM's authorized key files, but I get same error. Is there maybe another method to connect from the workstation to the VM !

Assuming that your workstation is running ubuntu, you can execute this command:\nroute add -net 10.4.x.x netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.x.x\n\nYou should also persist this static route in /etc/network/interfaces.\nThis is valid for recent Ubuntu version, I have tested it on 12.04 and newer.\n", "Q: How can I recover Deleted files during Ubuntu setup, the drives are not there anymore I was using windows 7 32bit then it was showing some problems so I switched to Ubuntu and I accidentally deleted all my files on the hard disk during the Ubuntu setup....all those collection, pictures, videos and projects I had in my life is lost!

If yes, then you may need to restore that setting to be able to boot into Windows.\nI had a GPT drive and I had to clean it (erase everything) and then convert it to MBR style, then repartition it for Windows and Linux separately and then re-installed Windows and Linux.

This partition should be at least as big as the RAM memory of your system.\n\n\nSummarizing, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 swap partition (at least as big as your RAM memory)\n\n*1 ext4 partition for every linux OS you want to install \n\n*1 ntfs partition for windows\n\n*(optional) 1 ntfs partition for keeping data shared among different operating systems (as suggested by oldfred)\n\n\nIf you want to prepare the partitions at the begininning, you can use gparted in linux or partition magic in windows (but I suggest you to do it in linux).\nI think the easiest way is to create a USB pendrive with the linux distribution, start you pc from this pendrive and start the installation process, during which you can create all the partitions you want of the size you want.\n", "Q: Scanner driver/software for Canon imageclass mf4820d multifunction laser printer on ubuntu 14.04 I am using Canon imageclass mf4820d multifunction laser printer.

My internet speed got slow since a week, if I download anything using uGet or bitTorrent it downloads very slowly, but if I download any software from Ubuntu Software Center, it downloads it with usual speed. Yesterday updated one software (Android Studio), updates were also downloaded with regular speed. Why speed becomes slow if i use any download manager or bitTorrent or even if I download from browser?\n\nA: Ports which was used for update is opened in your Ubuntu machine by default, and you can open bit torrent port or any other software port in  firewall with the following command and this would increase the speed.\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 'your port number' -j ACCEPT\n\nand\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 'your port number' -j ACCEPT\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: winusb gives me the error \"cannot move file to a subdirectory of itself\".

The initial problem was this: I wanted to test the installer I was creating for my app, but of course every time I run the installer it modifies the system, and I needed a way to reset the system to a clean state for the next test.\nMy initial solution was this: I created a small partition on my hard disk (/dev/sdb3) and installed Ubuntu 14.04 onto it.  I then created a second small partition (/dev/sdb4) and did a \"dd\" to copy sdb3 to sdb4.  My idea was to then test my installer on sdb4, and then reset sdb4 by doing another dd from sdb3 before running the next test.\nI set up grub to multi-boot (so I can pick my original Ubuntu partition, or the \"clean\" partition sdb3, or the test partition sdb4).\nThe problem I'm now running into is this: when I run grub, it gives me all the correct options, but if I ask to boot onto sdb4, it's about 50/50 whether I get sdb4 or sdb3.  I'm guessing that grub is not using the partition name, but rather some kind of UID in the Ubuntu install (so sdb3 and sdb4 look identical)?\nAs a side note, whether I boot to sdb3 or sdb4, when I run gparted, both sdb3 and sdb4 are shown as being locked.\nIs there something I need to do to sdb4, after dd'ing it from sdb3, so that it's clearly different from sdb3?\nThanks,\nChris\n\nA: Yes, duplicate uuids will confuse the system.  This is one reason why you should not be playing around with dd like that.  Another reason is that dd wastes time copying free space.  If you want to backup and restore the system, use tar instead.  If you insist on using dd, then don't copy to a second partition -- copy to a file instead.\n", "Q: How do I remove dependencies from a deb installer for an isolated system? I have created a deb package for an application created in Qt. I have included all the libraries that the application depends on, to be installed in a folder next to the application itself:\n/usr/share/MyCompany/MyProduct/executable\n/usr/share/MyCompany/MyProduct/Frameworks\n\nThen exported LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the Frameworks directory.\nAll perfect... Until I had to add QT Assistant, which requires additional libraries.\nAfter checking the dependencies for Qt Assistant, I added all the required libraries, including libQtHelp.so.4 and libQtWebKit.so.4, in the same directory.\nMy deb is very simple, I create the structure desired then set the \"install\" to copy my files to the target directories.\nblah_1/* /usr/share/MyCompany/MyProduct/\n\nTo create the package, I create the tar then \ndh_make --copyright gpl -f ../blah-1.0.tar.gz \ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -me@mycompany.com\n\nWhen running the installer on a clean (no Qt) system, I am getting dependency errors:\nme:~$ sudo dpkg -i /path/blah_1.0-1_i386.deb \n\nSelecting previously unselected package blah.\n(Reading database ... 141841 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking blah (from .../blah_1.0-1_i386.deb) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of blah:\n blah depends on libqt4-help (>= 4:4.8.0); however:\n  Package libqt4-help is not installed.\n blah depends on libqtwebkit4 (>= 2.2~2011week36); however:\n  Package libqtwebkit4 is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing blah (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for shared-mime-info ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n blah\n\nUnfortunately the system I am installing doesn't have (and will not have) internet access. How can I provide the packages required, in the same deb installer ? \nOr, how can I disable checking for dependencies, since I am providing the required libs ?\n(Ubuntu 12.04 if that is relevant)\nUpdate: I ran\nsudo dpkg -i --ignore-depends=libqt4-help,libqtwebkit4 /path/blah_1.0-1_i386.deb \n\nThe program installed correctly and ran perfectly.\nInside the package, in the /DEBIAN/control, i see listed the unwanted dependencies. \nAfter calling dh_make I had no dependencies in the control file.\nThe dpkg-buildpackage must have placed the dependencies after checking (likely for assistant).\nCan I remove them somehow ? Can I put a flag somewhere not to include dependencies ?\nOr... still.... can I add in my packaging thing the deb packages and is there a command I can give to pre-install as part of the package installation ? \nIf there is no solution.... I suppose I can provide a script to run the dpkg command as above, with ignore-depends, but then he package cannot be installed from the Software Center...\n\nA: According to man dpkg-source:\n-Dfield=value\n      Override or add an output control file field.\n\nAnd from man dpkg-buildpackage:\n--source-option=opt\n      Pass option opt to dpkg-source.\n\nSo perhaps you could override the Depends field thus:\ndpkg-buildpackage --source-option='-DDepends=...' ...\n\n", "Q: Why I can't start demo application on ubuntu-touch emulator I just created a new ubuntu touch emulator (ubuntu 14.10 sdk i386 devel).\nCheck device image version..\nX86 Emulator \naosp_x86 \ngeneric_x86 \n243 \ni386 \n\nI have a default QML code :\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\n\n/*!\n    \\brief MainView with a Label and Button elements.\n*/\n\nMainView {\n    // objectName for functional testing purposes (autopilot-qt5)\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n\n    // Note! applicationName needs to match the \"name\" field of the click manifest\n    applicationName: \"com.ubuntu.developer.username.newapp\"\n\n    /*\n     This property enables the application to change orientation\n     when the device is rotated.

(It took me quite a while to figure this out.)\nAccording to the compile output you've included in your post, you are using the i386 click target. I'm guessing you have the armhf emulator built and running, hence the error.\nYou need to do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an i386 emulator (this is the recommended choice)\n\n*Create an armhf click target (you can do this by going to Tools->Options... in Qt Creator and clicking \"Ubuntu\" in the list on the side)\n\n\nI recommend the first choice since the i386 emulator will run orders of magnitude faster than the armhf one.

I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed and on it, the keyboard works fine but none of the LEDs toggle (for Num lock et al). Is there a way I can find a driver for it and install it. The Rosewill website has drivers only for Windows.\n\nA: \nIs there a way I can find a driver for it and install it\n\nNo, it looks like there is not even a hint of this keyboard in relation to anything else than Windows.\nIf not on their website I would advice to mail them and ask for them to supply it (something like \"I am very fond of this keyboard but had to return it because I could not get this to work on Ubuntu\"). If nobody mails the they never will create one. \n\nI would approach this from another angle and advice to have a look at the xset command (xset is a tool to confige settings and the led options toggles leds). If these work:\nxset  led named \"Scroll Lock\"\nxset -led named \"Scroll Lock\"\n\nyou could alter your keyboard layout to execute these commands. xset has many more options: \nled     The  led  option controls the keyboard LEDs.  This controls the\n           turning on or off of one or all of the  LEDs.   It  accepts  an\n           optional  integer, a preceding dash(-) or an 'on/off' flag.  If\n           no parameter or the 'on' flag is given, all LEDs are turned on.\n           If  a  preceding  dash or the flag 'off' is given, all LEDs are\n           turned off.  If a value between 1 and 32  is  given,  that  LED\n           will  be  turned on or off depending on the existence of a pre‐\n           ceding dash.  ``xset led 3'' would turn led #3 on.  ``xset -led\n           3''  would turn it off.  The particular LED values may refer to\n           different LEDs on different hardware.  If the X server supports\n           the  XKEYBOARD  (XKB)  extension, leds may be referenced by the\n           XKB indicator name by specifying the `named'  keyword  and  the\n           indicator name.

I do not think you will be able to recover your Ubuntu installation as the partition was not just deleted but was also merged with existing Windows partition from Windows.  But yes, by all means, you should be able to recover your MS Windows installation.  You will need a Windows recovery bootable CD.  Once you boot from the Windows bootable recovery/repair CD, you can switch to a recovery environment and attempt to restore the MBR from there. \nWindows 7 repair CD has a commandline utility called bootrec which can not only scan and tell you valid Windows installations on your machine but can also rewrite the MBR to help you boot into it.

This happens almost all the time when I seek using keyboard or mouse.

The solution was, as suggested above but found experimentally, to switch to \"ALSA audio output\" module with \"Default ALSA Output (currently PulseAudio Sound Server)\" device. This worked for both.

I have a computer with three hard drives - one is the boot drive and the other two are in RAID1. The RAID is software RAID created during the Ubuntu installation. If I reformat and reinstall Ubuntu on the boot drive will it recognize the two RAID drives as being a RAID or will I have to reconfigure them back into a RAID? If I have to recreate the RAID1 array will have to reformat the drives and lose the data on them?\nBasically I may have to do a fresh install of Ubuntu on my boot drive and I do not want to lose the data on my RAID.\n\nA: I had faced this predicament once. I took the gamble and formatted my boot drive. Later on i realized that mdadm can assemble the RAID arrays even after a clean installation. What this means is, you dont need to re-configure the RAID once again. mdadm does it and the RAID device would be active for the system.\nRun sudo fdisk -l. This will list the RAID device, something like /dev/md0\nThen run sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 and you are done.\nCheck if it worked by running \ncat /proc/mdstat\nIf fdisk doesnt output any RAID device, you can run sudo mdadm --assemble --scan to automatically detect and assemble the RAID\nThe above instruction assumes that you boot from a completely different drive and the RAID is just a media storage\n", "Q: Changing screen Brightness with a script As you may know, screen brightness drains battery, that's why it is considered a big problem for laptops (at least for me).\nI can change the screen brightness but every time ubuntu boots up I will have to change it again.\nLuckily, you can write a script that does that for you. However, when the laptop is plugged in I do want the maximum brightness; which means I will have to do that by myself every time I plug in the laptop.\nIs there a script that detect if the laptop is charging or not and sets the brightness level accordingly?\n\nA: On my laptop I can check the contents of the file /sys/class/power_supply/C1BC/online: if the laptop is plugged in this file contains 1, otherwise it contains 0.\nFor example,\nif [ \"1\" = \"`cat /sys/class/power_supply/C1BC/online`\" ]; then\n  echo \"Laptop is charging/plugged\"\nelse\n  echo \"Laptop is discharging/unplugged\"\nfi\n\nNote.

I am on a clean install of Ubuntu (meaning I haven't messed about with audio stuff yet), and I am facing the same issue with my Dragonfly USB DAC as I have with other distros. When the volume is below 100%, the sound coming into my headphones through the DAC is barely audible, even when close to 100%. However, if I push the volume over 100% it becomes very audible, too loud in fact.\nIs there a known \"fix\" for this issue? I'm assuming there's some way to get around this since the audio does play through the DAC, the issue is just the large jump from soft to very loud when going over 100% volume. When not using the USB DAC, the audio is as expected. I can comfortably listen at around 30% volume.\nThanks!\n\nA: There is a known fix for this issue, but it does not mention the Dragonfly specifically, so I had a really hard time finding it too. \nBasically what you need to do is edit a line in the /etc/pulse/default.pa file. \nFrom:\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nTo:\nload-module module-udev-detect ignore_dB=1\n\nThen from the command line run:\nkillall pulseaudio\n\nThis should cause pulseaudio to stop and then restart, though I had to reboot my computer to get it work.\nI should also mention with this fix, you will hear output on the Dragonfly but will not be able to adjust the volume, until you select it as your output device in under System Settings -> Sound.\nTake a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the way Ubuntu adjusts my volume mixer levels?

The USB stick booted and i started the installation. When it asks me to restart to complete the installation i do so. But when i start up again in only boots from the USB and i have to start all over again. If i take out the USB stick it does not boot at all. If i open the internal drive in a live session from my USB stick i can however see the folders and files that ubuntu has installed. If i hold alt while starting up i get another option for booting other than the USB stick which has the name \"windows\" even though i never have had installed windows or tried to do so. When i try to boot that option it goes into a command line which says \"error: filesystem unknown\" and \"grub rescue\".\nAfter advice from an IRC i tried installing rEFInd. I tried all the installation methods however none of them work.\nHow do i fix this so i can boot up ubuntu from my internal drive?\n\nA: There are two ways of installing Ubuntu on a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Legacy Boot - Use the Mac variant of Ubuntu which you can download from here.\n\n\nInstall rEFInd before you install Ubuntu. Now, create a partition for Ubuntu using either Disk Utility or GParted and install normally. When you reboot after the installation finishes, rEFInd will load and give you an option to select either OS X or Ubuntu.\nThis is the easier method and is convenient if you are dual booting.\n\n\n*EFI Boot - Use the normal variant of Ubuntu.\n\n\nThis method is slightly tough because you will have to delete the grub partition created by the Ubuntu installer (on a FAT partition) and install grub on an HFS partition, failing which your mac will not boot. However, this method works better if you want to completely replace OS X with Ubuntu.  \nRefer to this website for steps to the EFI Boot method.\n"]
